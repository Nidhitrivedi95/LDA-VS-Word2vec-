2gUbgbdJ7IFSbicBXlSchw I was in Montreal recently and we were looking for a place that served great Steak Tartare, a lot of people online recommended L'Express, so off we went to L'Express on a Wednesday night.

Service: It was definitely above average, we unfortunately didn't make reservations but they created a table for us. The waiter wasn't really fluent in english but he did his best to explain everything to us.

Food: My partner had the steak tartare with fries and it was fantastic and the portions were generous. I had the roasted quail which was amazing, the meat just fell off the bones.

Ambience: It was a nice ambience and brightly lit, and I enjoyed the fact that it was very traditional based off my past experiences.
