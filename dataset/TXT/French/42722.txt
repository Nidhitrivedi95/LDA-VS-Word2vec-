LjOBNcNNpuewBqSPxYYTJQ While the staff quality, food quality, and coffee quality are consistent with other Amelie's locations, something about this space doesn't feel right. I think it's the open box style of the dining area. There are two forced nooks that try to capture the "living room feel" of the uptown location, but it just doesn't seem to work for me. The majority of tables are right in the middle of the place which gives it a Panera feel which I don't care for. Many of them had dirty dishes on them. There are some quaint seating options by the large windows, but again, not enough to make me feel quite relaxed. However, the covered outside seating is rather attractive and abundant and doesn't face the parking lot. The bathrooms are gender specific, cramped, and rough around the edges. Fixtures are dull  and a little aged and the floor was grimy and paper towel laden. 

If I found myself in the area, I would probably stop in again, but I wouldn't make it a destination place.
