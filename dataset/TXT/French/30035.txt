FNroBu0T0TmmMwLqNZqvaw What I liked:

-Their blue cheese & braised game poutine was tasty
-The décor is nice
-Good location
-My deer hamburger wasn't  really a burger, but it was good

What I disliked:

-Their ribs were crazy dry, tough and still had the silverskin on them, in short: inedible 
-The crocodile bites were chewy and the batter was too thick

Will I go here again?
Probably not, but if I do find myself somehow in this place once more I will eat the poutine and warn everybody in my party to avoid the ribs at all cost.
