KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA Great for brunch! We were seated outside overlooking the lake. The only thing I suggest is that they should do is to clean up the area before seating guest outside. There was bark falling into our table and also leaves that fell in my drink. Not flattering at all. However, the food def made up for it. Main entrees that stood out for me was the chorizo mussels for appetizer. The broth was amazing! And I also loved the French toast! Would def go back again and try other dishes.
