Oysters; Yummy
Like Dottsy Z., I haven't been blown away by anything, and I've tried probably a third of the menu.  Everything has been at least "good". but considering the prices, I'm on the edge as to how enthusiastically to recommend the place.  Service has always been courteous, which goes a long way with me, but a few times the waits have been oddly long at times that weren't busy.

The French onion soup is a hit for me, although I'd like slightly less brioche.  Served in a mini-tureen, the gruyere is baked perfectly, overflowing the sides in crispy yumminess.  The pate plate is interesting, but much to my disappointment it's not a liver pate.  The frites are almost British style - hot soft and limp, fabulous if you like that style, which I do.  

The outdoor patio is lovely, but can be crammed with tourists toting mewling babies and screaming tots when the weather is nice.
