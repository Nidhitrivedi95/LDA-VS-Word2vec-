xcmmTXhuMx2fZF2Bt69F4w Came here on a Sunday with the bf at around noon for brunch. Luckily there was no wait at all and we were seated inside. Our waitress was super friendly and made all the daily specials sound amazingly delicious! I came here craving French toast and I stuck with it despite everything else sounding so tasty as well. My bf got the daily special for the omelette and he enjoyed it. 

The French toast I got at first looked completely burnt (see pic I posted), however the black crusts were from the sugar caramelization (is that a word?). It was super delicious with the syrup they had on the bottom (somewhat tasted like condensed milk. YUM!) Because of the "burnt" parts of the French toast, the only complaint I had was that the bread was hard and it was difficult to cut with the knife. Other than that, the food was delicious, service was great and the prices were affordable!
