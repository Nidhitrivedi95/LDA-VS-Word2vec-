uTCOEqjuVAXUOzti5TWj2Q Beautiful romantic decor in beautiful Biltmore Fashion Park and surprisingly the price was very reasonable.

We sat outside in court-yard the weather was beautiful, it was perfect to enjoy our crepes and people watch.

We loved our savory *chicken florentine crepe* & sweet *PBH peanut butter banana honey* it was delicious. 

All the staffs were very nice especially Sissy and Maria, they rocks! We called Sissy the terrific .

We will definitely comeback and try something else in the menu.

Thank you Hayley and Yelp!
