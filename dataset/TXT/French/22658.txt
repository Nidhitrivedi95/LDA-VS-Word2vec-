bzbNGyrTwWHAgg1CqkSgeg Special thanks to everyone at Terrace and Nikki for hosting a lovely event! 

I've had brunch at the Ballantyne location. This was my first time visiting the South Park area. I was impressed with the menu this evening. Everyone was offered a glass of white or red wine. I selected the Chardonnay. I believe the other was a Merlot. 

Each course was served on small plates.

The Appetizers - Wild Mushroom Crostini and Buttermilk Calamari. I loved these items! If I had to choose, I'd say the Crostini was my favorite. The three cheese spread is life changing. 

The Beet salad was refreshing, however It didn't earn my memory. 

Entrees - Bourbon Braised Beef Short Ribs, Shrimp and Grits, and finally The Gnocchi & Wild Mushrooms. I was a fan of everything! I noticed the shrimp and grits came with a sauce---Which I didn't receive, I was slightly disappointed. The side of Vegetable medley was a after thought. No seasoning. I wouldn't recommend ordering this. 

Finally! Dessert!! I couldn't pass up the peanut butter fudge cheesecake! I should've ordered a slice to go!! I picked off the chocolate seemed a bit much. Plan to return in here again soon for brunch.
