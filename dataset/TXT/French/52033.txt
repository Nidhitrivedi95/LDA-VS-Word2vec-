pmoIMK8zGWvKsVOPDBYfzg Oh my goodness. Came here on a Saturday evening and was surprised to see it was mostly deserted. We used a Travelzoo voucher that made the meal $99 for two 3-course dinners with drinks.
I had the beef carpaccio which was good, but my date had the lobster bisque, which blew both of us away. I didn't know I liked lobster until I tried it at Andre's. We ordered the special: 2 Australian lobster tails (not part of deal) and it was seriously 100% the most delicious thing I have ever tasted. I still dream about that lobster. I'm afraid to try any other lobster now.
My date and I both got the grilled flat iron steak, which was tasty but nothing special and a little heavy.
My date got the chocolate souffle for dessert, which he loved - for me personally it was too heavy but I prefer light desserts like custard and mousse - which is why I got the creme brulee trio. Another winner here, probably the 3rd time in my life when I've had absolutely EXCELLENT creme brulee. The trio is composed of traditional, coconut and pineapple, and while the variations were intriguing, I will always prefer the traditional kind.
Unfortunately I cannot remember the cocktails we ordered but they were well-made (date is a former upscale bartender). 
Service was excellent! Waiter was on point and extremely attentive, our plates were removed and replaced within minutes of each other. This could change with patron volume, however.
