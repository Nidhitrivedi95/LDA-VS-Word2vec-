RZk_PE-H9SygqwSQd88cWQ This place is a true hidden gem. The service was amazing, polite, attentive, and accommodating of our food allergies. The restaurant is small, and clean with no frills as is the menu. If you're looking for fresh, delicious, amazing food with very little pretension at a great price this is the place for you! I would go back once a week if I could.
