3rj1qpgFvkRWtAka17mhEQ Good place to eat and if you are in the area, one of the better choices for comfort food.  I have always liked mimis especially when we don't know what we feel like, everything there is pretty good and their bread is awesome.  Head and shoulders better compared to anything in it's class like Marie calenders or dennys.  Nice atmosphere and good service.  

I do recommend their french onion soup, burgers, and pot pies.
