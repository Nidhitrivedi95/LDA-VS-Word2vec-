LQ_gYNs5E10IGFE0NOyD7A I am writing this absolutely wonderful 5 star review because I believe this is a true gem in Scottsdale. I met the owner and staff at their ribbon cutting a few weeks back and was so impressed with their ambience, friendliness, staff and most importantly food for cost! Their lunch menu caters to the busy workers in the area, guaranteeing you quick service. My co-workers and I were in and out in an hour. FAB! We were also pleasantly surprised when the gracious owner treated our 3rd co-worker to lunch (we were getting it to go as she could not step away from the office, totally made her day!). I sincerely hope this place is here to stay for quite some time to come, Scottsdale is lucky to have you! I hear they have awesome Sunday brunch as well and look forward to going to that one day soon!
