l2s4DSeQkzkzsmygKAOxQA Breakfast buffet, 12.00. 

Scrambled eggs, omelette, eggs benedict, sausage, bacon, sweet sausage, belgian waffle, cheesy mashed potatoes, homefries, pancakes, french toast, assorted fruits, juices and coffees.

Basically what I am trying to say is that ots not a basic egg, bacon, toast buffet. For $12, this buffet exceeded my expectations. Yes, some dishes *eggs benedict* may not look as appetizing as they would if they were fresh, but you can eat 5 eggs benedicts if you really want to. You know what I mean? 

Good food, very good price. Pretty happy.
