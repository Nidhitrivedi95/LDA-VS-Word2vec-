hvjgF-vnPw2jyL5DBuB0qg I was actually a bit disappointed going here. My friend is a huge fan and I've seen Chuck Hughes show so we made sure that this was one our stops in Montreal. After all the hype and everything that people have said, I had set my expectations too high. Some of the dishes were really good and others were too salty.

The place had a good vibe to it, very busy. We went here for a friend's birthday and ordered a bunch of things. We tried some oysters, which were fresh and yummy. My first time trying raw oysters and I really enjoyed it.

We had the fish cakes, which was great on first bite, until we hit the salt. That just ruined the whole dish. After all the rave reviews of the lobster poutine we had to try it. The poutine was ok the smallest and most expensive poutine I have ever tried. It had good lobster flavour, but it wasn't the best dish. The lobster risotto was good, the creamy, rich sauce is where the lobster flavour shined. The amount of lobster included in it was good; but it was a bit one the salty side too. 

My favourite dish of the night had to be the braised short-rib. It cooked perfectly until it was nice super soft, and the sauce on it was amazing. I recommend this dish to anyone who goes here.
