It is, of course, a fabulous venue and a feature of a Christmas in Edinburgh, but it is also underwhelming and overpriced should you decide to sit down within the velvet roped exhibition that is the dining portion of the one main room. On the other hand, the bar area provides  exactly the same visual delights and the relaxed atmosphere from which it is best to enjoy them.

I would recommend going for a drink and then moving on to dinner elsewhere.
