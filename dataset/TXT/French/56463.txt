rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Been here twice and had an excellent experience both times.  Everything I've ordered or sampled from friends was exquisite--the best mussels I've ever had, and the fries are simple yet flavorful.  Grilled salmon I recall was not too overbearing with just the right texture.  The desserts are equally impressive.

When my friend left to use the restroom, our waiter immediately came by and picked up the napkin on her seat to fold it.    

Nothing extraordinary about their martinis.  Champagne is a must for mussels, to bring out the flavor.  Ask the waiter for suggestions if you are unsure.

I wouldn't go to Vegas without stopping by Bouchon--but don't forget to get reservations--they get quite busy.
