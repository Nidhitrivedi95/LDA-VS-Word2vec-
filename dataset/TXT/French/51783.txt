2. Most amazing food!
-- lamb that is not overdone.  I've never had it so "less-cooked" before.  Not a huge fan of lamb, but it was amazing, and I appreciate how it was done correctly!
-- chocolate soufflé.  Fluffiest I've ever had in my life.  A masterpiece.

Funny how when it's just outrageously amazing, there's not much to say!

I will be back for sure!

Thanks! :)
