ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug I suppose I should have taken the complete absence of a wait to be seated (at 8pm on a Saturday night no less) as a bad sign.  My girlfriend and I were attracted by the advertised special of filet mignon dinner (complete with soup/salad) for $17.

The soup was a creamy chicken vegetable which reminded me of Thanksgiving, and it would have been pretty good had it not been luke-warm.  The filet mignon came with a hollandaise sauce, roasted potatoes and some steamed asparagus and green beans.  The filet had nice grill marks, which inspired some hope, but it was over-cooked, under-seasoned, and it tasted like it had been sitting out for a while.  The potatoes were pretty tasty, but the veggies were under-seasoned as well.

We also ordered some mushroom crepes.  These were the best thing about the meal, but not by far, and I am not exactly a crepe expert.  They tasted similar to the soup to me.  Perhaps some cross-pollination going on?

The proximity to our hotel elevators and a friendly (albeit somewhat inattentive) waiter helped redeem some value on the experience, but all-in-all, I think I could have executed the meal better in my own kitchen.

Bottom line: There are lots of great restaurants in Vegas, so, unless you are trying to avoid long lines at the dinner rush, you may want to consider more options.
