VwZhwflLnTq19aAeFLJHCQ Bernard's gets high score in my book. Our dinner was delicious! We had the chicken and mushroom crepe with a side salad and the lamb chops with potatoes and asparagus. The side salad had just the right amount of dressing, the crepe was hearty like comfort food. Did I mention the piping hot sourdough baguette with butter? Service was attentive and professional. A wonderful pairing of white and red wines were suggested with our meals. The live music wad delightful. We were thoroughly satisfied so why stop there?  We ended on a sweet note of creme brûlée and chocolate ganache cake. Fabulous! Now if they can just get the lighting right, they would be perfect.
