htQgj-ANQpZGpIpkkrEmyQ Been here a couple of times and I rarely give a restaurant 5 stars. The service and food were stellar. I'd recommend trying the udon carbonara and INSP burger with the duck fries. Amazing. 
The owners clearly put in a lot of effort into their menu and their chefs deliver. I'm a huge fan of Asian fusion and they definitely satisfy. Reasonably priced...make a reservation however they are almost always busy.
