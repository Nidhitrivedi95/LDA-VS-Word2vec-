rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A The server was pretty chatty and then would disappear but that is my only complaint.  

I love the location, the decor of the hotel, the view on the patio, and the food!  I uploaded a picture describing my brunch selection at Bouchon!  How great does Cinnamon Oatmeal with Peach Puree & Raspberries sound?  What about a Turkey Sandwich on Cranberry Wheat Bread with Aioli & Brie?  

AMAZING! Caution:  HUGE portions for a French bistro!
