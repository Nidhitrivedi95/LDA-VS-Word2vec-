XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q So when you drop a couple grand on a 2 person 15 course dinner with paired wine you expect a lot.

One thing I expect is to actually get all the stupid courses in something resembling a reasonable amount of time. 

So I figured let's assume every course takes about 10 minutes. That's about a 3 hour meal. No problem.

So everything starts out great. We get our first course and our wine pairing.

This goes on smoothly for the next 4 courses -- one dish is taken away and another replaces it nearly immediately. Super!

Then all of a sudden I see a group of - I have no idea really how many but it seemed like 50-100 people pass by and get seated somewhere in the back.

And guess what? The food stops coming out. It turns into a twenty minute wait in-between each course. So we eat our little tiny bite, drink our little glass of wine and wait and wait. Nothing to drink, nothing to eat. So then we end up ordering a bottle of wine just to have something to do while we are waiting.

This went on for the most painfully long-time I can't even describe. We never did get all our courses. 

Frustrating -- you would at least think they would say something or comp something or do anything but no such luck.

What we did get to eat was fabulous though.
