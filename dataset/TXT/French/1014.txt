_cjPEH9wXhKS-HQe_U3M4Q This place is an experience. From the second you walk in you get the full treatment from start to finish. The layout is really nice it's set up making anywhere you sit feel like a private space. It's a very intimate decore which gives it a feeling of warmth. Each day they have a meal special- I high recommend Sunday's ribs.wow. For all meat eaters out there this is the dream! They also offer a byob for wine for a corkage which is always a nice touch
A very nice spot for a special occasion or celebration
