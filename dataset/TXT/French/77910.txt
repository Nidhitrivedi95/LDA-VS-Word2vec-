YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g Came in for appetizers and snacks at 4pm. Beautiful restaurant.  Empty since it was in between lunch and dinner. 

Was greeted by the manager Aaron. Was very polite and welcomed our party. Made us feel at home! 

We ordered the onion soup (amazing!) tacos and sliders. Every single appetizer was amazing. But the standout was the onion soup. 

I definitely want to come back here for a romantic date. Thanks Aaron!
