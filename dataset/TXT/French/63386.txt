SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA I've been coming for many years, and it is still excellent. The kitchen puts out a consistently good product every time. I go back for favorites, but always include a different choice each time... The escargot was a new treat, very different than your usually present butter and garlic. I really was reticent to share a taste w my table mates! Service is always on point too.
