IYreMhkT6e02tsbw-Dex5Q Been here three times.  New is Sewickley so wanted to give it a chance.  Very small portions and just OK food.  Not hot when served despite. Ot being busy.  The kitchen is open to the dining room and twice the entire restaurant smelled like fuel (butane or something) during our entire dinner.  Needs some improvement if they are going to make it.  Don't expect the, to be around in a year.
