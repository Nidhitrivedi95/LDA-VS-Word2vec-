nWW6fBfBljiRFa4sG7TyxA Excellent customer service (because we had to wait well over 30 minutes past our reservation time, our group got a round at the bar on the house) and a really great atmosphere, but as a vegetarian, I'd come here for the drinks but find dinner elsewhere. 

Ram Jam cocktail was excellent. The Chartreuse sizzler was also good. The vegans at the table enjoyed the Banh Mi sandwich that came with fries (which I stole from them) but I got the Mushroom Vol Au Vent (mushroom and tomato stuffed puff pastry with lentils on the sides) and while there wasn't anything bad about it, it wasn't as flavorful  or as memorable as I was expecting for the place and the price.
