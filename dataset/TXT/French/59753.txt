However, this place is so busy that it's difficult to get a table. I had a decent tasting and reasonably priced Pinot Grigio from the Champagne Bar but had to sit at the bar itself as all the tables were taken, thus I only stayed for one drink then left. I would recommend that anyone wishing to visit should phone or email in advance and pre-book a table.

Ultimately an entertaining and amusing place to tick-off on a personal 'Tourist Type Things To Do List' whilst in Edinburgh. However The Dome isn't somewhere I feel inclined to return to - once is more than enough. It's just a bit too superficial and extravagantly tasteless to warrant more than a one off visit.
