AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw Great Macaron!!! I love the pistachio, vanilla and strawberry!!! $7 for 3. They also have a self-starter kit which teaches you to make your own... but I wouldn't bet on it. Macarons are sooo hard to make! 

Chocolate was great too! I highly recommend getting the coffee one! It's had a soft, molten core oozing out toffee as soon as you bite through the chocolate shell! 

Crepes are great too! How could anyone hate crepes?
