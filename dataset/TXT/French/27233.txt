dd3GZs6zW2t7BM0cbxAzvg I took my boyfriend and his parents here for brunch because it seemed like the most decent option available for New Year's Day. (most everything was closed) I was excited about the menu when I looked online, from escargot to tartare to eggs benedict. We ordered the snails and it was...okay? I mean it wasn't excellent but it wasn't bad, I would say mediocre. I have had better because the flavors just didnt' stand out for me. My eggs benedict was burnt and the egg wasn't very poached. My biggest complaint about this place was the service. There were 2 waitresses, it was clearly not busy.  I had to flag the waitress multiple times before I gave up and physically went straight to her (TWICE)to ask for more water and the bill. When I went to the waitress to ask for the bill, she irritably explained to me that she was coming to our table. I didn't appreciate her tone and excuse and I didn't appreciate that she was not attentive to our table at all when it was seriously not busy.

Horrible experience, and mediocre to below average food. Will not come back again.
