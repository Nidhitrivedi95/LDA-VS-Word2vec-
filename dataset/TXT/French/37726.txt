jalA5zHW8ZfY3RSPG7oDxQ The courtyard is a wonderful lovely venue for outdoor dining.  It is small and quaint for one of our good-weather days this summer.  On this particular Tuesday evening we had a 6:15pm reservation for four and it was not crowded inside or out so I'm feeling very lucky.

Our server was gracious and helpful and not intrusive.  The menu selections offered a nice variety for carnivores and vegetarians with some of the options being salmon, chicken, pork chop, and eggplant.  This evening, one of the special salads had watermelon, tomatoes, and avocado as ingredients and I ordered that along with the pork chop.  The salad was so refreshing and both the salad and pork chop had an eye-appealing presentation.  My pork chop was thick, succulent, and moist.  

This is an excellent choice for an intimate dining experience.

The only downside is that it is BYOB and it is cash only.  Thank goodness our friends joining us tipped us off to those facts in advance.  Thus, the 4 star review instead of 5.
