AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw We made the mistake of ordering sandwiches here, instead of pastries.

This reminds me of a souped up corner cafe/kiosk (or a gourmet Starbucks/Coffee bean) you find inside a mall, that emulates to be a coffee/tea/juice spot with an over-extended menu. 

Just like Starbucks/Coffee bean, the pre-made, clear-wrapped sandwiches are sitting in the display case at roughly $10 a pop. 
Personal preference: I don't like it when sandwiches are pre-made sitting in display cases. However, they do toast/warm it up for you. 
Sometimes, keeping it simple is the better way to go. It would be better if they just kept it with coffee &amp; pastries to go. 

Overall: I wanted some chicken sandwich with my salt. Good golly, I have no idea how they prepare all their sandwiches. I was so disappointed with the saltiness, I tried the other sandwiches - which were equally, if not more salty as well. Hmf. The bread however was all kinds of good and right - crusty, chewy, hard and soft.

Pricey OJ - Fresh squeezed - $5-6 (I forget) for 12 oz. 
The coffee pricing is on par. 
Espresso is STRONG.
