0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g My husband and I debated on making a reservation here. We looked into eating here months prior to staying at The Bellagio, and therefore budgeted on the meal probably being close to $500. 
From walking into Picasso we could tell we were in for an amazing experience. We were welcomed by numerous staff, the ambiance was fantastic with fresh flowers, and I will go ahead and mention that we were seated right by the window which made dinner spectacular because we were able to watch the fountain show and to see all the lights on the strip. 
My husband and I choose the gustation menu along with the wine pairing. I debated choosing the wine pairing, but am so glad that I did because I was able to taste/ experience the finest pairings. The starter (lobster salad) was fantastic. Next, and my favorite, was the scallops with a wine pairing from Budapest which was amazing! For my main course I choose the snapper (which I've never had before), and it along with the wine pairing from Sicily was again amazing! 
We thought being a French restaurant the portions might be small, but by the time desert came we were actually very content. 
The staff was great, they poured my husband and I more wine if one of us drank it all prior to eating the certain course. I was a little iffy about the foie gras and only took a couple bites (first time trying it), ended up giving it to my husband, and afterwards the waiter informed me he could had supplemented something else which I thought was nice and good to know for next time. 
Desert was amazing, yes the bill was extremely pricey, but it was definitely a dining experience and one I will always remember. Great job Picasso!
