XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q It's by far the best fine dinning experiences I've yet to try. No other restaurant has come close to the food, service and ambience. 

   The restaurant also sends a complimentary limousine which drives through a secret route to a mansion on the grounds of the MGM hotel. We were escorted by three different people just to get to our table from a back entrance. We never had to walk through the casino.

    My husband and I were seated on their terrace which was romantic and lit by candlelight. I ordered the six courses and my husband had ordered the 16 course tasting. Six courses was way too much for me and by the time the cheese cart came I was too stuffed. The bread and the mignardise cart were the best part of my experience. The cocktails were unique and tasty.

   Our service was nearly perfect besides them not refilling our water at times. My husband and I enjoyed our amazing meal that evening. The food amazing classic french. I don't need to ramble on in detail about the food because it's Joel Robuchon! It's a real three star michelin restaurant and one of the best in the country so you should experience this place as soon as possible.
