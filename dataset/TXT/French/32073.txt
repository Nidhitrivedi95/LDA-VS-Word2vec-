gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA Among tthe best of the many great restaurnts in Vegas. We were there during Restaurant Week and had a pris fixe meal for $55. All 3 courses were well prepared, and well presented. Unlike some high dollar places, the portions were also very generous.

Great food served in a great atmosphere. What more can you ask?

(The lobster bisque was by far the best I have ever had.)
