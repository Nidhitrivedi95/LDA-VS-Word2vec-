SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA The food and wine were really excellent, as was the ambiance on the patio, but I would agree with several others in saying it is a bit overpriced.  Brasserie food should not cost $50 a person.  

Nonetheless, if you don't mind the price, I thought the mushroom french toast appetizer was heavenly.  I also enjoyed the goat cheese tart, the special goat cheese pasta, and the chocolate raspberry napoleon.  

My fellow diners enjoyed the duck and cassoulet, but since the patio was pretty dark, found it challenging to eat food off the bone.
