RfsMUrGUJdrpfrU54rmEsQ We truly enjoyed this place and will definitely be back. The escargot was absolutely the best I've ever had. The charcuterie was fantastic and gigantic - we actually couldn't eat it all. Our waitress Clementine was delightful - she's quite French with a marvelous French accent.  This place is tucked inside a corner shopping center in Gilbert and you could drive by here a hundred times and never know this place existed -- it's worth looking for.
