XgkTmVrlHHO5g96AfOAfpw We went for happy hour. They have great happy hour prices on drinks and appetizers. We decided stay at the bar  and share a few appetizers. We started with trois fromages, 3 cheeses served with a French baguette, sweet & spicy candied walnuts, and caramelized red onions. Then we split a  quenelle lyinnaise (a whitefish dumpling in lobster sauce - omg!!) and the boulettes de viande ( veal & pork meatballs).   We were very impressed and can't wait to go back for the dinner menu. Good service, delicious food.
