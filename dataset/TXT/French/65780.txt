ucgzkl7atsBMGu4gGpmHfw I love this little neighbourhood resto. The menu changes every week (some items on the menu will stay the same) so there's always something new to discover there.

My personal favorites are the Devils on horseback (bacon wrapped dates) soo delish! Honestly everything is good there the chef creates some really unique dishes and if you are a true foodie/food lover you'll really enjoy the food here.
