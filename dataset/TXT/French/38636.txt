Well, of course first of because I'm French, so I guess that makes sense.
But everything there is awesome: the pastries, the bread, the coffee... And even the service is very friendly!
The raisin roll is my favorite and it really tastes like the ones you can find in France.
Perfect for breakfast, awesome sandwiches for lunch, and I wouldn't mind going back for a pastry after work...
