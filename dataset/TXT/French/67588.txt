UxWH8zRYIBgs6Q2oykvRdw Just the right restaurant with the right ambience to take your wife to (or husband) for your wedding anniversary dinner. We came in early at around 5 and found that the place was not yet busy. We were led to a 2 seater table at the back. I find that annoying. As if only bigger parties deserve a centrally located table.

My wife ordered the salt cod donuts while I ordered the chicken liver tartines. Delicious absolutely. For entree my wife ordered the Double pork chops. She was happy with it and I agreed after a bite that the pork chops were crisp on the outside and tender and juicy on the inside.

I ordered the pot au pho braised lamb shank. That is when disaster struck. I have had lamb shanks before. Granted they were primarily at Persian restaurants and as stews. But there was something wrong with the way the lamb and the whole thing tasted. Should it be so strong and repulsive to the palate? I did not want to spoil it for my wife by being difficult and arguing with the server. But in hindsight I should have returned it. I can never recommend that dish to anyone. 

Overall good experience. Great place with lot of delicious menu options. Terrible lamb shank though.
