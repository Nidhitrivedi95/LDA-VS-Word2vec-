lcTa0q9Wo4wNyLCIgWFRUA I feel weird reviewing this place because it seems like nobody comes here, and the reason nobody comes here isn't because it isn't good, or because the decor isn't nice. Neither of those things are true. It is nice, and the food is actually alright. 

I feel weird about writing this because it feels like I'm missing something. The decor is nice and the food is decent, so why does no one come here?

Am I here at the wrong hours? Did something horrible happen here before I arrived, once, or did someone in a local newspaper write a terrible review? Am I in the uncool eat place in town, and somehow, I just don't know it?

None of those things seem possible, really. Société is a pretty damn decent place. Food's good. Looks great too, like one of those French bistros you find in NYC (think Balthazar) where people gather at all hours. The only thing that's missing is the people -- at least, every time I've come here.

Maybe people just haven't found out about this place yet. Who knows. Maybe it's really busy on weekday mornings. I have no clue. 

Regardless, in case you're reading this review because you want to come check it out and you're uncertain, you should in fact come. I always end up here on Sundays, once for a brunch with my girlfriend, and another time just by myself for coffee. Both times were nice. The people are friendly and the atmosphere is a cool old fashioned vibe.

And hey, you definitely won't have to wait for seating. At least, not until this place gets discovered. Enjoy!
