rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I've been a fan of the bakery ever since I went in Napa Valley. This place is tricky to find. Under the escalators by the show area. 

I got the ohohs and chocolate eclair. Both were great. This time the cookies were the star. The oatmeal, chocolate chip, and the TLC- oatmeal pecan cookie. The TLC was delish, tho all three were great. 

I may want to stay in the Venetian just so I can go here more often!  The tuna sandwich looked yum.
