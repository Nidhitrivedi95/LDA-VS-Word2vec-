The service was awful and had it not been for us asking for water, or bread, or where our cheese plate was, or when our entrees were coming, we would have gone completely ignored.  All the while, a couple who obviously knew the manager due to the way they interacted upon entering the restaurant, was immediately seated, received their food 20 minutes prior to us (same dish), and were waited on hand and foot.

This place used to be good.  I had been a few times when a different chef was in charge and it was superb.  Now, I'm not sure what happened.  Sure the atmosphere is top-notch, but with such dreadful service, and mediocre food, atmosphere will only go so far.  Look at other reviews--you'll see I'm not the only one complaining about horrible service.
