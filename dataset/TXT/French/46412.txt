nhl7ZnypDgDESAedF2O6ZQ Made a reservation for 11 people and was accommodated right on time. We were seated in a private room (without needing to request it). Our waiter (Joe? Sorry if your name isn't Joe!) came and greeted us immediately, asked for drink orders, and made recommendations based on our specific requests. He had a great, professional yet personal/humorous demeanor and gave us ample time to decide on our orders.

The food was fantastic all around! The scallops appetizer was yum - very fresh. Our party covered most of the bases (AAA steak was perfectly cooked as requested, lamb chops were said to be great as well as the salmon and seafood dish, and the duck was very moist and flavorful).

I'd definitely go again for both the service and food!

Also TIL shirley temples are non alcoholic. Oops.
