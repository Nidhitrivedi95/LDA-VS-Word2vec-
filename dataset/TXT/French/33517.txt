hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA Run, don't walk to this place.  Talk about great food mixed with excellent customer service!  Olivier and his team do a phenomenal job!  The food is ridiculously good and the price is right on point.  Wife and I ate on sight (croissant breakfast sandwiches), and took some quiche for the road.  Yelpers got this one right.  Well worth the 15 minute drive from the strip.
