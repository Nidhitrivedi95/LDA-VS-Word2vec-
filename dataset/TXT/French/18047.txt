A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g I melted when this gorgeous cake topped with macarons was unvailed.  My "surprise" bridal shower cake was airy, fluffy, moist, and lightly sweetened. Every single layer and bite was delightful! The glazed strawberries on top and the slices layered within were plump, juicy and crisp. Folks... This is a fresh as it gets. Period. 

Since it was a "surprise" shower- I had to ask the host where she purchased this masterpiece-- Patisserie Manon. A quick review of YELP! solidified that I wasn't the only one who loves this spot. In fact, all the girls who attended the shower couldn't stop raving about the cake. It was a THAT delectable. It was perfect. 

Would I order cakes/pastries/ treats from them in the future? 

Absolutely!! I would highly recommend this adorable little shop to others. Go ahead and get your sugar fix here!
