SJo_IjvzdRtCvZVN0cbrRQ first time eating brunch here and overall food was good.!!  I had the corned beef hash which was okay..the prices a bit much and place was very hard too find (party of 8 cost $200 for brunch?!$)..just look for the blue door..also great service but atmosphere okay.. with food prices so high the owner can def afford to repair ceiling in dinning room and a store front sign. we might be back
