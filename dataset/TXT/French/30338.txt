FRuuIDOd21pTJHvEGIt1Gg Service was good.

However, the food was just okay. We went here on late Saturday afternoon and they only have lunch/brunch menu.

I ordered Veal Steak Frites, it was just okay. Sauce was okay, no flavor and under seasoned.

They do have good ambiance and decor.

I would only go here if there is no other place to go or when you are in a pinch and extremely hungry.
