D7CnTsm8SCmbQghz1ioPdw My wife and I found this place after random Googling/Yelping, looked at the pictures online and thought it looked good and decide to give it a shot. 

I've been to a lot of restaurants where i've looked at the pictures on the website, thought the food looked great and was then very disappointed by the presentation and flavor, however this place was not like that at all. 

The menu had a lot of great items, however we decided to go with the off-menu tasting which was recommended by the bartenders at Taverne Merchant Royal (owned by the same restaurant group - also a great place). 

In total we had 7 courses: 
1. 4 Oysters
2. The green salad
3. Foie Gras Tourchon
4. A tomato salad - I think this was a special
5. Bison Tartare & Duck Smoked Meat
6. Guinea Fowl 2 ways - the special that night
7. Deconstructed S'more

Every course was great, however the Duck Smoked Meat was probably one of the best things I've had in my entire life! The meat was perfectly prepared and the different bits that came with it made it even better. If you go with the tasting menu, you won't be disappointed, however I highly recommend the Duck Smoked Meat if it's available. Desert was also great, but we were too full to eat it all.

Service was great, the waitress was very friendly and explained every course and also the wine tastings they had selected to go with my meal(s). 

If you are only in Montreal, definitely check this place out, even if it only for a quick drink and an appetizer.
