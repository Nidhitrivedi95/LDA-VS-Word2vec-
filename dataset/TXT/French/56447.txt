rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A As always, my disclaimer is... my ratings are given by comparison. The food here is definitely better than some other places I've rated more favorably BUT to be fair, those other places only cost me 6 bucks versus the $86 I paid here so... you know, to whom much is given, much is required. 

Getting back on track, I spent four days in Vegas and of all the meals I had this was by far the most disappointing. It started with our server's recommendations, which felt very low on sincerity and high on up-sale. It ended with the six primarily underwhelming dishes listed below.

Deviled eggs - really good but limited in the wow department by the simple fact that they are deviled eggs.

Bone Marrow - which I've never tried before but ultimately found to be too sweet for my liking in accordance with my table mate who  suggested the dish based upon positive experiences at other restaurants. 

Pate - fancy spam?

Gnudi - highlight of the meal and the only thing I would've ordered again if given a second chance.

Roasted Chicken - good but if you told me it was from costco I might have believed you

And finally...dessert, which we'll alphabetize under U for un-memorable.

With a bottle of wine my one-third of the bill came to $86. Not only that but now I had no high priced amazing meal to brag about when I got home, so I also blame it for the $111 I spent the next night at Ruth's Chris to make up for it, which BTW was worth every penny.

Diet. Your pockets will thank me. Your tastebuds will too.
