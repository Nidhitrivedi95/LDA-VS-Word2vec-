hzyvL2v97xLzLbLXcdi1uw I had lunch at Cafe Moulin on a Sunday during the Shadyside arts festival. The three of us arrived around 1:30 and the restaurant was completely full. We only had to wait about 10 minutes before we were seated at a bar area near the door. At first I was disappointed not to have a table, but it worked out fine. The restaurant is below street level and has a very cozy feel to it. I had the Alaskan crepe and a cappuccino. Both were absolutely delicious. My niece ordered an iced coffee and unfortunately, it was luke warm and the ice melted before she was 1/4 of the way through. Other than the coffee problem, all three of us devoured our food and loved every bite of it. If I lived in the area it would be dangerous because I would want to eat there every weekend morning.
