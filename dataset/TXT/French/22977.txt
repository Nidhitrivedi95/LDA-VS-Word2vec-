bzbNGyrTwWHAgg1CqkSgeg Lunch Spot when in South Park! 
I was eager to try the Terrace Cafe having gone to school with the guy who now owns it and Ive been promising to try it. 
I took my grandmother to lunch there on a Thursday around 12pm and walked right in. The front door staff seemed a bit distant and robotic, but walked us to the table up the stairs. We sat overlooking the first level and were approached by our bright and friendly server, Vivian. 
We looked over the VAST menu and teetered between lunch and breakfast. Both looked Great. 
We chose lunch. Granny ordered the Hawaiian Chicken Salad-Salad and I ordered the Mighty Corned Beef. Both were of good size when they arrived. Granny's salad was a Large scoop of delicious, Pineapple-laden creamy chicken salad that was Super fresh and light, over top of crisp mesclun greens. I wasn't sure what the dressing was, but it was sent on the side (love that) and granny didn't even use it. 
My Mighty Corned Beef was just that! A beautiful sandwich of HOT Corned Beef, Chef's Slaw, Russian dressing, on perfectly toasted Marble Rye. Served with Thick Cut Steak Fries, this was a MEAL to write about (that's why I'm doing it). Although we were full, the dessert tray (nothing beats a tray) was brought over. The dessert portion sizes were great, small enough to have a few bits if sharing, and large enough to not feel ripped off! We shared the Blondie and it came out HOT, with a perfect scoop of vanilla and flavorful. 
Service was perfect, food came out fast, drinks stayed full, it was overall a wonderful time.
