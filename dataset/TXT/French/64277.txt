tCSlpwJQ4CZsUEMZeH2SFg The crepes at this place are phenomenal!! I was very pleased with my brunches here.  The restaurant is unique inside with a lot of seating and even a bar area to sit.  There is a patio for warm days and nights.  An overall fun atmosphere.

Service is great.  I have had dinner here once for restaurant week and was very pleased.  Never a bad experience.
