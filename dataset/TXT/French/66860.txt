UpEVdq_euH-5mqCIgUAd2Q Winterlicious 2016 - food was delicious :) One of Toronto's oldest restaurants I was told. Had the choice to upgrade to their classic french onion soup (which did not disappoint) for a starter, the mushroom medallions for my entree, and the pouding chomeur for dessert - didn't go wrong with these choices.
