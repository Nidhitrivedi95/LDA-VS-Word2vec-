4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I had high hopes for this place. 6000+ reviews and 4 stars?!? I don't get it. Have any of these people reviewing been to France or even had French food anywhere else? If looking at the service alone then give this place 4 1/2-5 stars but the food was nothing worth raving about. 

The complimentary baguette and butter was a nice touch but the baguette was way too stiff to even cut with a knife. It seemed to have been microwaved warm. A baguette should be crispy on the outside and relatively soft on the inside but this was tough through and through. I ordered the chicken, brie and apple crepe and it was ok. Nothing to write home about. When I asked for hot sauce the server gave me 2 mini Tobasco bottles which were adorable and a nice touch. 

My server was wonderful. She was informative, attentive and friendly. The best and only good part of my visit. If it wasn't for her I would have rated this place 1-2 stars for the food alone.
