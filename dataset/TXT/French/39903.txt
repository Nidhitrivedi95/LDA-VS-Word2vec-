K64Uw3a2Enh2MznpwRHWKQ I have been remiss in not writing my review sooner; Razz's is now closed for summer.  I enjoyed the best meal I've ever had in my 7.5 years living in Phoenix at Razz's earlier this year.  I couldn't even tell you all the delicious things I ate now, but that's exactly the point.  I didn't order for myself - I sat at the bar and ordered the Chef's tasting menu.  Razz himself decided what he wanted us to have and stayed with us thoughout the entire meal.  He is quite the entertainer and a very interesting man, to boot.  He knows his food is good and he will certainly be happy to tell you!  The time he takes off during the summer he spends traveling the world and tasting food from all over, so he knows how his cuisine measures up.

Don't let the strip mall location fool you - the inside is quite quaint and if you're going to spend the money to get a good meal in this town, turst me you won't be disappointed!
