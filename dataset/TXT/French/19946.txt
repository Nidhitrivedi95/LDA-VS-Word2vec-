aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw one bad thing about staying at the venetian / palazzo = easy access to bouchon bakery = me getting fat. 

i couldn't resist... this time 1 whole box; w/ one of each flavor. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw?select=qbvvcN-o0qOwnlX6MerPxQ

this time, i'm listing out my most to least favorite flavors in order:

coffee
chocolate
raspberry
orange (okay it's tie w/ raspberry.. i guess it depends if i'm feeling sweet or tangy)
lemon
vanilla
