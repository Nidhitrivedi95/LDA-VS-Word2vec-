4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I love this place!!!! Hands down the best steak sandwich ever!!! I come here every time I go to Vegas!!! I love love love the frites? I think that's what they call the french fries that come with the sandwich? They are so thin and crunchy!!!! It's like a nice crisp taste not like the extremely hard and crunchy taste where you feel like your teeth are at a disadvantage.... 
I also had the open faced crab salad sandwich!! Loved it as well!! I went on a limb with this one because this place is a steak house... everything with steak should be delicious!... I came here for dinner once with the bf and he ordered the filet mignon.... Omg!!!! It was freakin butter!!! I love this place!!!!
