ovtlrcsVRlgZZQUlHs_ovw What a nice, relaxing place!  The server was very friendly and helpful, and their french onion soup is the best I've ever had.  The martinis were wonderful too.  I had a delicious beet and arugula salad, and my friends chose dessert (chocolate cake and creme brulee).  My husband's very large sandwich was also very good. The outdoor seating area is surrounded by misters, so it was comfortable outdoor seating on such a typically hot Arizona day.  We will definitely eat here whenever we are in town.  My Arizona friends took home a take-out menu.  Now, I want to eat at French Bistros wherever I go.
