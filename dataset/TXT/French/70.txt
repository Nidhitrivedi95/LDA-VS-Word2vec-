-4TMQnQJW1yd6NqGRDvAeA Well, we are back in Scottsdale so we had to come back. Was this place a one hit dinner or does it hold up for round two? I am pleased to say it was just as good, if not better! It was perfection. Every bite, every minute of the service, the ambiance, all of it. This is a must eat at place. Tonight I had the chicken meatball and gnocchi with a side of the smoked broccolini with poached egg and smoked salami (holy smokes it was too decadent to be called a vegetable). The dessert was an expresso mouse coffee cake with berry. The cake had the sugar topping (like a creme brûlée) all around it. Just stop y'all. I can't even. A-mazing!
