4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Great little restaurant. My girlfriends and I went here on a Friday night for a bachelorette party and it was perfection. We did have to wait for a table even though we had a reservation but the view of the Bellagio fountains was stunning, the temperature was great, the food was amazing but the service was the best of the weekend. I would highly recommend this place to a friend. For the very reasonable price I don't know why anyone wouldn't check it out.
