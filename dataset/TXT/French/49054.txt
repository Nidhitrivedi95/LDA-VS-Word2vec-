OmFXBWLv1DoFelP2-RLqFA What a refreshing spot on Rue St. Denis, which is overrun with chain restaurants and bars.  I loved the decoration, music and vibe of the place...and the service was top notch!!  

The entire tapas menu sounds so delicious, I had wished we were with a larger group so that I could try them all!!  As it was just my husband and I, we had some serious decisions to make...I would say, my head was spinning from the choices and it put me in a state of "confusion"!

We went with the hummus, bacon wrapped dates, beef carpaccio, sweetbreads and sweet potato fries.  The only dish we didn't really enjoy was the hummus.  It was far too salty and that's all I could taste.  We try to steer clear of too much sodium on a regular basis, so perhaps we are overly sensitive to the taste.  Everything else was delicious.  The carpaccio had a very nice vinaigrette with capers and the dates were delectable.  My husband raved about the sweetbreads, but I was too busy shoving sweet potato fries in my mouth to take a bite of his dish.  

Those.Sweet.Potato.Fries...oh.my.goodness.  These were the BEST sweets that i have ever had...and that means a lot coming from Miss "I'll sub the regular fries for sweets, please..".  I have no idea what they battered them in, but I'm determined to find out.  Then the truffle aioli,  had juuuuust enough truffle to not make it over powering.  I just wish I lived in Montreal so that I could eat them more often!!

There's no confusion about it, this place is outstanding!
