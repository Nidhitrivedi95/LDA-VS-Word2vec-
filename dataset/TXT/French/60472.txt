SBnpT6JDbah-5l_52GM5sw I only spent a little bit of time in Madison, but I won't soon forget dinner at Sardine. What a wonderful restaurant. They had at the bar one of the most skilled bartenders I have ever seen, who made me one of the most amazing drinks I've ever had. Their menu of specialty drinks are incredible. The food also spot on. 

The location is one of the best parts about it too, with great views of the lake, a beautiful, classic, yet modern space, its very comfortable to spend a good deal of time in the building.

I can't wait to go again, if I'm ever back in Madison again!
