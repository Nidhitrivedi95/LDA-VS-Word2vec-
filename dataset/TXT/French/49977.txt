The yelp reviews did it justice. Lots of little baguettes and pastries filled this place. 

Our selection was a little sad- I mean, what do you expect for stopping in at 3pm on the Saturday of Labor Day weekend? But we split this chocolate eclair dessert- and mmmmmm. Oh how I love desserts. Nice and chocolate-y, yet not overally sweet? Mmmmmm.

Had we had been more hungry and had we come earlier, we totally would have gotten more. Definitely worth the stop..... :)
