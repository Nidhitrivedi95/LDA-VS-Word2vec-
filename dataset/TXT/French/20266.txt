I have mixed feelings about Metro. On one hand, I ADORE their oysters during the happy hour. They have decent drink deals. On the other hand, I haven't been truly blown away by their dishes. The restaurant is just A-ok with me. And I'm ok with that. 

My first visit was for restaurant week. While I can't remember exactly what I had, what I do remember were the perfectly cooked scallops. They were so tender but perfectly seared on both sides. 

On my return visit, I had a macaroni and cheese dish that had ham and sauerkraut in it. While I left satisfied, I wasn't amazed. 

My third visit was for happy hour. I ate lots of fresh and delicious oysters, while my buddies ordered the "famous" cheese platter (yawn, don't bother) and the escargot (another disappointing app). 

So what do I think? I think that Metro is good for drinks, oysters, and a decent dinner. I think the service is great. I think it's an a-ok place in my book!
