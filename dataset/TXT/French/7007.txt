Stellar. Absolutely stellar experience. We were seated out on the patio with a great view of the Bellagio water show. Score! My bud Andy T. (Andrea T.) recommended this restaurant to me and raved about the Steak Bordelaise. This dish features a tender pounded steak with topped with caramelized onions and red wine sauce. Delicious!

We also tried the equally delicious Steak Bernaise. I love Bernaise sauce. I'd put it on everything if I could.

Andy, you are my food soul mate. Next to the hubs, of course.

Visit #2 the next day:

Came for brunch and had the Ham & Cheese Crêpe. It was a Ham & Cheese Crêpe. Nothing out of the ordinary but still tasty. I tried to take a photo only to be met with a blinking red light signaling my camera battery had died. Lame. Service was A-OK but then again it was also insanely busy during that time. 

Will definitely return!
