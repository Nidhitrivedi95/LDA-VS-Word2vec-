I wanted to write a review for this restaurant after a regular dining experience and an experience as a wedding guest.

The regular dining experience was great. The atmosphere was cozy and romantic, and it gave a really "French" feel to it.

Re: food - Small portions, but because we ordered the $100 5-course tasting menu, it was just enough to make us feel full. Some of the dishes were more memorable than others, such as the quail and lobster dish, but the others were good too. The total price of the meal, including three glasses of wine, taxes, and gratuity, came to $315.  I don't think that it was actually worth the price, to be honest, but it was an interesting experiencing and the staff was friendly and professional.

The food at the wedding was great as well, definitely better than most banquet hall menus. However, I would say that the quality of the regular dining experience was better. The service at the wedding was impeccable and just perfect. All of the staff members were friendly, helpful, and very down-to-earth. They really do allow you to customize the decor to your liking, but my friend didn't add too much to what already existed because it looked great on its own.

Overall, 4.5 stars for Auberge. I think that this is a place to experience once in your life if you're willing to splurge; however, if not, I'd suggest going with the Summerlicious/Winterlicious menus to try it out.
