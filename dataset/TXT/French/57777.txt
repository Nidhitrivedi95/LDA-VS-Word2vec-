rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A This place lives up to its reputation, that's for sure.  The atmosphere changes to French theme from the Italian venetian feel the moment you walk in.  They had little almond pastries to sample in the waiting area during the brief wait.
The service is efficient, fast and friendly.  Never once was my coffee cup or water glass empty. 
The food was amazing.  My favorite was the chocolate croissant.  We also had the omelette, it was delicious. 
Overall great experience, would definitely come back during next Vegas visit.
