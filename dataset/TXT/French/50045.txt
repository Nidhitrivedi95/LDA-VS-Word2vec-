It's situated in a long street of cute stores and shops in Lawrenceville. I parked on a side street and walked down. Upon arrival, I noticed it was a busy, busy place. Small, too. Even so, I was greeted quickly and ordered several items, including:

-Ham, cheese, and butter baguette: Huge, filling, delicious, top quality. Would buy again.
-Lemon tart: For my mother. She liked it.
-Clafoutis: For my mother. She adored it.
-Chocolate cake: Delicious!
-Large macaron: I honestly forgot to eat this. And just realized as much. Darn!

I understand the allure of this spot and would absolutely return in the future. They do sweet and savory well!
