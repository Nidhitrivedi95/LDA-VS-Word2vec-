rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw Came here for brunch and had the most incredible experience! The food and service was excellent and our server was very helpful and knowledgeable. I ordered the short rib croissant Benedict and it was absolutely wonderful. Also have bottomless rose which is always a bonus. Definitely recommend to anyone looking for a nice brunch in Vegas!
