Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA We dined here last night with a group of 5 and I must say, I am shocked it took me 3+ years to try this place! The interior is beyond beautiful and it will probably go on my list of must-see venues for tourists to visit while they are here. 

Imagine Voodoo Lounge at the Rio with  better views and incomparable 5 star menus. All of 5 of us tried the "Classic" tasting menu. 

Classic Tasting menu:  
--Pre-Menu: A mouse, sooo good. It tastes like bacon but better. 
1. Potato Gnocchi with asparagus cream & pesto. AMAZING!! Everyone at the table agreed it was the best Gnocchi they had ever tasted. 
*** I added Tuna Tartare as well, it was tasty.***
2. Lobster Curry. OMG, Imagine the best tasting indian dish you ever put in your mouth with a melt in your mouth buttery lobster! 
3.Filet w/ Foire Gras. Cooked PERFECTLY. So good!!
--Passion Fruit Foamy Cocktail. I have no idea what the real name is, but it was a unique end to the meal. I will look forward to it again :)
4. Baba cake. Not my fav... I would probably sub this out because I need chocolate. I am not subtracting any stars for this because the view made up for the Meh dessert, plus everyone else at the table loved it, 
--After Dessert: Vanilla Cookies, fresh with nutella. 

View: If I could Give a view 10 stars, I would!! It was amazing!! Make sure you use the club restroom so you can have a view even while you go ;) 

Service: 10 Stars as well! Our server was very engaging an answered a ton of questions about the chandelier and history of the restaurant. 

I will be back!! Plan about $200 per person for Wine/Food for a nice meal :)
