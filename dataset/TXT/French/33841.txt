hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA I rarely write reviews while still at the restaurant unless it's so good or so bad I have too. Unfortunately this if for the latter. 

I would give this restaurant a 3 normally for the nice patio setting and the food being okay, but their customer service just angered me. 

We ordered a special juice they had made thinking it would be delicious. It was Watermelon lemonade. Unfortunately when we sat down we tried it and it did not taste very good at all, so we politely asked if we could exchange it for anything, even something much cheaper. They said no. 

We started eating our sandwiches and still did not get our soup till 7 minutes later and our latte 12 minutes later. 

We also noticed there was no chicken in the chicken sandwich. We went in and when they saw us they asked "WHATS WRONG NOW?" We asked if the chicken sandwich had chicken in it and they took it and brought back the same sandwich with a few bites out of it just now with some chicken.  

When they finally brought out our latte they also brought out two pastries and apologized, but unfortunately the damage was done. 

Presentation is lackluster. One redeeming quality is their carrot soup that we had the first time and their vanilla latte. 

Unfortunately I'm not sure we will be back.
