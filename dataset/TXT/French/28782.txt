eJ9L40jm5VOXCIq7xs9kQw Bonaparte is exactly what I picture when I think of a French restaurant:  very upscale, very conservative, maybe even a little bit stuffy.

But the food is oh-so good!

As was mentioned by another Yelper, this is definitely the kind of establishment that attracts the more experienced generations.  I think we were the youngest patrons by at least a decade.  And be sure to dress appropriately; this is definitely a skirt & blazer kind of establishment.

But unlike many French restaurants you find in the States, conservative does not equal pretentious at Bonaparte.  Our server was happy to engage us in French, instead of forcing the conversation to English as many French speakers will do.  He was friendly and engaging and enthusiastically gave recommendations throughout the meal.  He was everything you could hope for in restaurant service.

And the food was excellent - some of the best traditional French I've ever had.  I'd highly recommend the Duck Confit, the Escargot and the House Foie Gras.

The wine list was also awesome.  I could have spent the day just talking wine with the waiter.  Even if you don't usually drink wine at a restaurant, I'd recommend you indulge here.

My only regret:  in hindsight we should have chosen the tasting menu.  I can only imagine.
