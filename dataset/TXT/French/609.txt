-unEKbRspO6OuEaPdmRywg 4 stars for the food (well, maybe 3.5), but 0 for service, which reached the "holy hell how is it so bad?" territory.

Literally every single dish ordered, all the way down to the post-meal cappuccino, was given to the wrong person. How does that happen? Unless our server has dyscalculia, I just don't see how it's possible (though if he did, I feel kinda bad, though maybe he could've said something?).

Further, we were either in "smother with upsell" mode or "quietly ignore" mode throughout the meal.

Coup de grace was asking for a wine bottle recommendation under $70 and being told he couldn't recommend anything. Really? Then either (1) don't have them on the menu or (2) lie. But please, don't (3) make us feel cheap at your 3x-4x markup of some mediocre-to-begin with wine offerings. Completely offensive.

My meal was the curry-cauliflower soup (nice taste, a good amount of heat, but a little unfulfilling) and the duck confit salad. Not *great* confit, but not bad. Wouldn't recommend it unless you really really are in the mood and have not-too-high expectations.

Montreal has way too much good food and service to return here.
