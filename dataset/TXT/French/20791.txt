AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw Payard is one of the few places in Vegas that sells macarons so of course I had to try it.  I got the last box of macarons that day (a dozen for $28 + tax).  Included pistachio, rose, chocolate, lemon and raspberry flavors.  They came in the fanciest box ever.  Too bad they didn't taste as good as it looked.  The macarons were alright...nothing spectacular though.
