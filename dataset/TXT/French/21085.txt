b3wgQ6CccBO8fgvlbS0M1Q Who knew a chocolate croissant could be so hard to find!   I'll always love Au Petit Four because they helped solve my craving - one that I had for three months.

Actually, my husband and I have been back many times - just for desert - and enjoyed every visit.  We met the owner (I think), who happily shared   tips of where to visit outside of Paris. (If they guy wasn't the owner, I don't care because he was charming, French, and made us feel special.)

I want to go back and try an actual meal. But with certainty - it will always be a favorite spot for desert.
