This place came recommended by many Yelpers and I would strongly suggest making a reservation a bit in advance. As a solo diner I had to wait an hour for just a seat at the bar. 

Service is as you'd expect à la française: aloof and taking themselves VERY seriously. In a good way in terms of service, but don't expect your cartoony version of a chatty, friendly Canadian waiter. Fine by this antisocialite. ;)
