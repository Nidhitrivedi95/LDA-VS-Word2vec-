or4UVDjXEEjze3wNPjoAZA Just got done with lunch and service was horrible. Julienne my server was very inattentive. She came around to check on things hardly at all. When I finished she took my credit card and ran it and then slapped the check down on my table with a "here you go" remark and off she went. If Julienne worked for me she would have been FIRED!
