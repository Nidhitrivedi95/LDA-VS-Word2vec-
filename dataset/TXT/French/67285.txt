uTCOEqjuVAXUOzti5TWj2Q Everything was wrong in this restaurant. Starting with the service and then the food. What I ordered was not even close to what the menu says. The manager told me that "They can't please all their customers" ... really. I totally understand that at some point some mat not be at your taste. But not being what you ordered is totally different.
Bad experience. Will never go back...
