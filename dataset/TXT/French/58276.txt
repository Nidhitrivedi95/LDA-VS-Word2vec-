rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Was excited to eat breakfast here.  Had to wait about 35 minutes which we were okay with since the food was supposed to be good.

We got to the table, ordered two sparkling wine cocktails.  Waited 10 minutes, waitress was wondering what was taking the bar so long, checked and we got the cocktails.  They were good, maybe a buck or two more than other restaurants but still acceptable.

Ordered corned beef hash and sausage and eggs (we're not chicken and waffles people unfortunately as the table next to us ordered it and they seemed to like it).  Waited another 10 minutes.

Got the bread, which was good but hard to chew as there was a lot of crust and not much insides.  The raspberry and butter tasted great on the bread.  Almost forgot what we were doing, watched the huge clock on the wall tick another 20 minutes by.

Got the food, the hash was cubed (which is fine), a little dry, but tasted okay.  Sausage was good size and taste, but the scrambled eggs looked puny on the plate.  The table next to us agreed: don't get anything with scrambled eggs, you'll be underwhelmed.

Our waitress didn't seem to be having a good day, but we've all been there at work.

Saving grace: sausage and eggs came with a croissant which was exceptional.  Slightly flaky and buttery, delicate and delicious.

Bottom line, skip the restaurant for breakfast and go to the bakery for excellent pastries instead.  Then go to the Paris and eat at Mon Ami Gabi.
