gISrxk4A5dfrjDivkC-L-Q I absolutely love this place! The cookies are consistently amazing and the service is great. Very authentic. The next best thing to living in Paris. I really need to try the hot chocolate! Has those nice little touches that you won't find anywhere else. Pricey yes, but totally worth every penny.
