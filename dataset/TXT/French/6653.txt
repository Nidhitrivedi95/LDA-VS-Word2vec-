4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Mon Ami Gabi has got to be one of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas, and is definitely my favorite on the strip! Every time I have eaten here I have had a great experience. I have eaten here so many times that I have tried a lot of different dishes. I love their French Onion Soup and how they bring other soups to your table in a kettle and pour them in your bowl in front of you. I never have to wait too long for a table, and the service is always great as well. Mon Ami is also worth the money, and it is reasonably priced for being on the strip. If you want a great meal with a good atmosphere, I really recommend trying Mon Ami.
