aM4pb4teV2Tr0Z-ZRt4icg Words can't even describe this amazing place! Two of our most favorite things gelato and macarons!!! After researching the best place in the Phoenix valley for macarons, we repeatedly saw incredible reviews for Le Macaron! We decided to drive over 30mins to see if Le Macarons was truly the best place to get macarons! We surely weren't disappointed!!! The gentleman working was very patient and kind as we were trying to decide what to order first. The atmosphere was so fun, we really felt as though we were in Paris!!! The gelato was the best we have ever had, so smooth and so full of flavor!!! The macarons have set the bar so high! Never have we tasted macarons like this! They were so fresh, slight crunch on the outside and so very soft on the inside. The flavors were amazing...Absolute perfection, not too strong and leaving your mouth wanting more! We have definitely found the best place in the Phoenix valley for macarons!!!
