rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I was in Vegas again, this time with a new girl friend. After a few days of huge breakfasts in full american style (we are from Italy, therefore we look for typical american fare in the morning when visiting) she was craving for croissants...
We tried Bouchon at the Venetian, which (a pleasant surprise) is fully operational for breakfast. We had a selection of croissants, actually a huge plate with 5/6 of them, amongst the very best I ever had (Paris included). Of course you may as well have excellent Omelette and more traditional item, all nicely done and well presented. 
Also the cappuccino was nicely executed, big as expected being in the US, but that's another story. (How can people have a cappuccino after dinner is beyond our comprehension!!!)
Ambience is up to that of a refined bistro. Boucon itself is at the 10th floor in  quiet section of the otherwise crowded Venetian. A Place to linger and indulge in a luxurious breakfast with a special person. A wonderful way to start a morning, business or pleasure or whatever awaits you in Las Vegas.
I will be back soon.
