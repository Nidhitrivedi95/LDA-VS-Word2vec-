JsAjP49bCk9KjJmmmjyM4w Absolutely the best croissants and pain au chocolat in the city. No better way to start your day than with a Balzac's latte and a fig croissant!

Their namesake treat, the Clafouti, is also excellent (it's a tart/pudding-ish dessert with lots of embedded whole berries). And I can't forget - their gourmet sandwiches are also quite tasty - interesting tastes with fresh ingredients.

If you can't get there in person regularly then buy in bulk and freeze your tasty treats (croissants actually freeze quite well and if you buy 6 you can avoid the GST!).

And yes, the good stuff sells out fast - so go early - at least before 10AM on weekends (but please leave the last croissant for me ;-)

Just doing my bit to maintain Clafouti's well deserved high rating! Keep the buttery yummies flowing...
