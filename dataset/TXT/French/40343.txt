KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA I really wanted to like this place. I had been there before to check out the wine list. The location is awesome. Love the cute lake and all the geese and rabbits running around. The service was not good at all and not even close to what you would expect from such a place. The server was bland, seemed flustered, no personality...forgot our wine (it is a wine shop/restaurant) and did not bring for 5-7 mins after first course was dropped. Food quality was so so. Extremely overpriced for what you receive. Very disappointed...sadly would not return.
