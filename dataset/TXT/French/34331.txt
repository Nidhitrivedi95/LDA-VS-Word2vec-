HL6ZzGF7V-KDaU0zziHyEA I am sometimes disappointed by foodie restaurants...  If I'm going to pay this much for dinner, it better be amazing.  Maison Boulud did not disappoint.  We had the tasting menu (all at the table must partake) and they accommodated all of our food allergies so  at times, we had 3 different dishes for 4 people.  

The service was excellent.  Our sommelier, Alex was very enthusiastic and knew his wine.   He recommended a very tasty Pinot Noir that went with most everything on our menu.  

-cheese biscuit-like amuse bouche and creamy broth soup started our meal perfectly.  So much flavor in that soup - eat it slowly for full effect.  

-baby chicken was cooked so tender and accompanied by tasty poached radishes.  

-butternut ravioli with pancetta (?) and milk foam made me pause with my eyes 
closed, "mmmmm..." I muttered as a reflex. 

-my husband's venison was so tender and tasted like high end beef filet... I must admit I was nervous about venison but really liked trying some of the meat. 

-short ribs with sweet bread... I was never a fan of sweet breat - the thought of thymus or pancreas was just too unappetizing and the flavor was never good enough to keep me from thinking, "I'm eating thymus."  But Maison Bouloud has changed me into a sweetbread lover - perfectly seasoned and cooked that I actually ate the large piece on the plate and wanted more.  

-My husband reported his sea urchin dish was okay - flavor was overpowering of fish so some people would probably really like this.  

-dessert - beautiful creations of "stained-glass" candy on cream with tiny crisp meringues and fruit.  Not too heavy, which was perfect for a very filling foodie meal.  My husband was actually stuffed!

Beautiful contemporary ambiance in the Ritz Carlton.
