cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg Perhaps the only people who go here are so thoroughly prepared for the experience that they are always pleased, but I found the place nauseating.  The food is so excessively greasy, fatty and unhealthy that is makes feel ill to think about it.  The place and the patrons seems to celebrate that, but that's just hard for me to understand or appreciate.
