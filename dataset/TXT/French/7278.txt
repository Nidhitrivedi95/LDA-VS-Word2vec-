4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Enjoy authentic French Bistro Cuisine while you watch the Belogio Water Show from the Terrace of my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas.  There is ample outdoor seating and a great wine list to chose from.  A great place to dine before you catch a show at the Paris or go shopping at the Forum shops.  If you only have one chance to eat out in Las Vegas and you enjoy French Bistro dining, make sure you come to Mon Ami Gabi.  They take reservations and you may need them especially for dinner.
