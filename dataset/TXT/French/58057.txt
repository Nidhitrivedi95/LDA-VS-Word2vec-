rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A This was my one and only real meal in Vegas during an intense weekend outing. Even though I felt extremely sick during my meal, I still really liked it (I love food in general)!! We went for "brunch" at noon and left at 3pm!

I got chicken and waffles. It's not a great thing to get when you're hung-over but it really is delicious. Its a little heavy (the gravy you pour on the chicken is heavy) and the waffles have little salty pieces of bacon on it, but it is DELICIOUS. I especially like the combo flavor of sweet syrup and salty chicken. The chicken was also super tender, probably some of the most tender I've ever had...

I tried my friend's croque madame and it was DELICIOUS as well. The brioche bread was buttery and delicious and the ham was a good salty contrast. The french fries were amazing as well (probably some of the best fries I've ever had).

I got a chocolate croissant which was amazing (honestly everything was amazing) and the bread they serve you is great too. Desert was even better! We got 7 deserts and I think I tried all of them. The best were a creme puff / ice cream pastry thingy, chocolate cake thingies (so good!!), and the lemon tart. The flan was good, but i didnt have a lot. I didnt like the custard that much.

This meal was amazing AND I was feeling realy sick (so this should underscore how amazing the meal was). I honestly wish I felt better so I could have enjoyed it more. Must come back!!
