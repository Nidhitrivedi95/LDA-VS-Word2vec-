I've experienced a few different Michelin rated restaurants and this one is the best yet.  There was only one thing on the menu that I wasn't a fan of (Uni) which they were happy to substitute for something else.  The flavors of each item in each course blended well together. The textures were diverse and pleasurable.  There was an undertone of Umami through most of the dishes which tied them all together.

I'm a big guy and often leave tasting menu restaurants feeling like I'd like to finish the night off with a good greasy cheeseburger from the fast food joint on the corner.  Not only did I not feel hungry at the end, but I was offered more food than I could eat.

Tip: take it slow, and easy don't gorge yourself in the beginning, because the desserts are *awesome*.  They're both beautiful and delicious.
