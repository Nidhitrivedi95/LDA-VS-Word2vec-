uRSPHDMBtYedbBbbHd3gOA Glas is an intimate wine, appetizer and dessert bar at 1118 Queen St. East. It's the perfect spot for a first date or a light night out. The first time I was there was with my cousin: I ordered a slice of their chocolate cake and a glass of red. Both were delicious (I'm still learning about wine but I'm an expert on cake). My cousin is gluten intolerant and Chef Danny was kind enough to put together something special for her. The second time I went was for a first date. Again, the wine was lovely, and this time, Danny sent gourmet  cherries to our table. A welcome addition to the Leslieville community. http://www.girlabouttoronto.com/?s=glas
