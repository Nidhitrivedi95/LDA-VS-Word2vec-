XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q A most excellent dining experience.  If you are in Vegas, you need to go here.  Period.

They have free limo pickup and dropoff from your hotel, schedule this when you make your reservation!

Excellent, friendly and accommodating service.  Very nice decor, very opulent French.  You get some of the uncouth Vegas riffraff at times but its Vegas.  Food is excellent, some outstanding and some a bit short.  Dessert was outstanding.  Bread and dessert carts are outstanding.  Nice gift to take home for the ladies.

The ~4.5 course dinner for $148 is a great value, with plenty of food and you still get the full experience.  Highly recommended.

Be aware of the house champagne offered, its $45 a glass.

Will no doubt be going back every time I visit Vegas.
