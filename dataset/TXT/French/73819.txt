xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g Service is excellent.  I had foie gras.  It was delicious.  The duck was perfectly done.  The lobster medallion appetizer was very good as was the roast chicken.  The warm Ceasar salad was unique.   All in all an A plus dinner and worth the cost.  Ask for Tom and Carlos to wait on you as they are a team.
