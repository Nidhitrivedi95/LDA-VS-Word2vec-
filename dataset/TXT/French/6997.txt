4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw As a huge fan of all things breakfast and brunch, I turned to Yelp for a recommendation and again Yelp came to the rescue!  My husband and I were seated in the sunny (but still cool, which is very important in Vegas) sun room of Mon Ami Gabi for brunch and started off with their crab cakes (well, 1 crab cake actually) which was delicious and unlike other crab cakes we've had, this one did not seem to have much filler and had huge chunks of crab!  I enjoyed my fresh blueberry french toast and my husband devoured his seafood crepe which had scallops and shrimp as big as my ear!  Service was friendly and overall it was a wonderful meal and experience.  We'll definitely be back!
