4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Wow!!   I always love this place, ken was our server and deliver amazing service.  He made the evening enjoyable so ask for Ken. I started with the escargot and love it!  Great flavor and paired with the warm bread make it perfect!  Go on a Sunday as that is the only day they offer Beef Wellington!  One of my favorites and is was perfectly cooked medium rare, with just the right amount of sauce. I paired it with the asparagus, which was cooked to perfection.  No desert this time but I k ow from others visits it's a great ending to the meal.  I will go again thanks to the great food and top notch service.  Sorry the picture does not do justice for how good it tasted!
