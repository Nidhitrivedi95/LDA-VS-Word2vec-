4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Made reservations for a late lunch on a Sunday afternoon. They gave us a table near the servers' area close to the kitchen. Really? Asked for a table in the patio where there were empty tables. Hostess replied we had to wait 30 min. Are you kidding me?? Restaurant was not busy mind you. Needless to say we took the "reserved" table. But as you can see this is not starting out right. Service was okay. Food was so so and overpriced. 2 stars for the service. Won't be coming back that's for sure.
