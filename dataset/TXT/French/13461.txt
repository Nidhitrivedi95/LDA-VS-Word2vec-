4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I found this place on yelp for my first Vegas trip. I wanted a memorable and delicious meal. What I got was overpriced and poor service. The food was good but the setting was cramped and awkward for the price. It felt like an Olive garden with $40 meals. Our server was clearly too good for the likes of us despite us dressing in formal wear and ordering drinks, appetizers and steaks. I would recommend anywhere but here for a date night, unless you like feeling judged in a mall restaurant setting.
