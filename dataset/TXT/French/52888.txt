QeEQXdto_4wFRaNKyIygRA Visited on a Friday for lunch to try their blackened fish and it was just ok...nothing special.  What was worth the visit was the RED BEANS & RICE!   It was delicious and we would go back just to eat that again.  I ordered the chicken pita with fries and it was ok, nothing special either but I would get it again if I had to come for lunch.  The crab soup was not the best, but the service was fast and on point.  It is worth maybe giving this place a second shot.
