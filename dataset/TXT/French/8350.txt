4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I love this place for too many reasons to list but here are a few:
Best french onion soup on the strip. 
Great Sunday brunch with a huge bloody mary bar.
Make a reservation for the terrace and enjoy a nice bottle of wine as you watch crowds of people walking up and down the strip. Never a dull moment. Also a nice vino list. Even the pickiest connoisseur will find a wine to match his taste.
