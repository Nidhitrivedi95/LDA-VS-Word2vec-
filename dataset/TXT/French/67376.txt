utYpyFOjNisHl1h7lDGSGA Gorgeous French bistro, complete with rustic charm, cosy atmosphere and lovely vintage posters on the wall. I had a three course menu here and at the end of the meal felt so full I could hardly move!

The creme brulee was something in particular to shout out about - there was salt on the crust of the dessert, giving it an added dimension of crunch and taste. It came in the traditional French style; flat, round and extremely enjoyable. Will definitely be back here - the best French food I've had in the city for a long while.
