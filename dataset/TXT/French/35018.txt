HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw Went for Happy Hour, in one word: Excellent. Great selection of drinks 50% off - lots of variety and very unique cocktails. The half off food menu isn't watered down either. I enjoyed tons of Oysters, the Oxtail bone marrow and the steak tartare and all were delicious and presented well. Bill came out to be about $100 with 20% tip, which I consider reasonable for the quality and service. I would absolutely recommend this place to anyone for Happy Hour if you want a better than your local bar or have a hot date!
