i2dnic7VdQ3NyiQQWUXHbA Atmosphere is laid back with a hint of fancy. It's set up to look like a dinner but the lights are slightly dimmed to cater to dressy attire as well. I noticed the theme applies to the food also, they serve some simplistic food but with an "oomph". We ordered tartare, snails, the cheese burger and spaghetti.

Tartare- very good, if you like raw meat you can't go wrong.

Snail- never tried them before and for a first experience I would say they were seasoned appropriate for their texture and made them quite enjoyable.

Burger- we got it with extra foies gras. It's like a glorified cheese burger ... It had to be the most satisfying cheese burger I ever tasted. The foie gras adds to its fatty and greasy texture. Overall my favourite dish.

Spaghetti- loved the buttery/creamy texture. The egg added to its delicious multitude of flavours.
