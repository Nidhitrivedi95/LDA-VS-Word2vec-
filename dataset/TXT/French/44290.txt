ME6D5nLlfG0xZCtICOYDuw We went here on a very slow Sunday evening, we had made reservations but when we first walked in we were ignored by the staff hanging out at the bar for a good few minutes as they didn't seem to want to help us and there was no hostess in sight . When we were seated we were sat at an end small table, kind of away from people. Now to be clear we dress very well i believe I had a Michael Kors dress on that evening and we are fortunate enough to have the money to eat out at nice places but my fiancé is a body builder with a lot of tattoos and even though he dresses incredibly well we had a slight feeling of discrimination and did ask to move to a larger more comfortable, intimate booth.. Once we were seated our server was great.. He made great conversation with us and was very knowledgable with good recommendations . The food was good, my fiancé being a large guy had to order a second entree so portions are a little small (for him, keep in mind) I liked my food(i ordered the duck confeit) but I was not overly impressed. My fiancé loved the food but I was more impressed with the service from  our waiter we may go back again but not my personal number one pick.
