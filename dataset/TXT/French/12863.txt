4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Mon Ami Gabi in Las Vegas is a MUST whether you are one person or a group of 20!  The location, food, service, pricing and experience is a combination that is hard to beat!  Every time I go to Vegas - It is a MUST!

This trip we had a company party (about 20) in the private dining room overlooking the Bellagio fountains and I must say it was a highlight of the trip!  The service was superb from the drinks (My choice - grey goose slightly dirty with blue cheese stuffed olives) to dessert (My choice - banana's foster crepes).  We were allowed to order off the dinner menu (rather than a fixed 'group' menu) which was an added treat for everyone.

We ordered about 8 chilled seafood platters to start our meal which was plenty for 20 people....amazing chilled lobster, shrimp and oysters!  Worth every penny!  People loved the french onion soup (we were able to get the recipe)!  You can go wrong with any of the steaks (signature hand-cut fries are a MUST) top it off with banana's foster crepe or creme brûlée and you have gone to heaven!

- Not in a group?  The terrace is fabulous for any meal but no reservations outside!
