50-xiTYmE6NERi-yJ6NvHw I love this place. 

The food is excellent. Oysters are a steal at $1 each. And the service, bar none, is the best I've had in the city. 

I had Biff's and Carisma listed at my top 2 places, but after the negative experience at Carisma (read my review), Biff's has made it to the top of my list. Yay - you deserve the win, Biff's. 

Try it out. Be prepared to drop some money though - things add up, but the food, service, ambiance, everything... believe me, you won't regret it. 

Bon appetite!
