4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Birthday Vegas Trip: 4/3 - 4/9, 2013
One of my favorite meals of the trip!  

We found ourselves one morning up with the sun and full of energy.  So after a quick peruse of Yelp, we decided to walk over to The Paris and try this place for a nice early breakfast.  We were seated out front with a lovely view of The Strip - a nice mix of fellow early risers, joggers, people off to work, and a few lost souls who had never made it home the night before!  Needless to say, excellent people watching out on the porch.

Our waiter was FABULOUS and I am kicking myself for forgetting his name.  Super handsome man, too ;)  His presentation of the specials convinced me to get a special Eggs Benedict with spinach and mushrooms.  My fiancé chose French Onion Soup and a croissant.  Because, as our waiter so eloquently put it "You're in Vegas, you can do whatever you want!"  French Onion Soup at 7 am?! Why not!  Paired with a Bellini for me and a Chimay for fiancé, it was a truly delicious breakfast.  

Highly recommended for breakfast!
