HojKatUfX4UHWaPqtl63NQ My husband and I went to Rivea for our five-year anniversary dinner. The food was excellent and the view was one of the best in Las Vegas  of the Las Vegas Strip. We had a table next to the window and arrived just prior to sunset. It was great to see the area before and after dark. All of the wait staff were extremely knowledgeable as to the wines and food options. Our server, Lee, gave us two excellent recommendations as to wines to have with our duck. Both wines were extremely complimentary to the melt-in-the-mouth main course of duck. We chose three appetizers to share:  the socco, the octopus salad, and the calamari. The octopus salad and calamari were excellent. I expected something slightly different with the socca-- more of a rolled crepe instead of a fried chickpea type of pancake. For dessert, we had the limoncello baba. Talk about a special dessert...mmmmm mmmm good! All in all, a great evening for a special occasion.
