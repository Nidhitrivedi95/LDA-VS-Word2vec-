qltrxd6_usFu1Q0mM5ZCNQ Hip spot for a younger crowd. No problem getting a reservation a week in advance for a Friday night; the place was busy but not full . while we were there. 

Loved the gratis homemade pickles with peasant bread and chive/shallot spread. Fois gras app also successful. Avoid veal cheek main -- the Asian-style sauce was too bitter. Steak frites was better and cooked as ordered but is the most expensive menu item. Iced tea came straight from a can. 

Service could have been more attentive but we never felt rushed. Not a bad meal but not a destination either.
