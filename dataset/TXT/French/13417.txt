4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw This restaurant was highly recommended by two of my friends.  Outside patio seating is nice if you like to people watch.   But did have a small of sulfur in the morning occasionally.  Not sure where it came from, but didn't ruin our breaksfast.  I ordered the corn beef hash, which was delicious.  The poached eggs on top were a little over cooked, but it was still good.  I don't like hash browns, but these were very good.  Good service.  I would highly recommend.
