mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q From the small plates concept to the sexy black and red decor, L'atelier is a fabulous spot to indulge in a little (or a lot) of luxurious decadence. I had the foie gras stuffed quail with a side of roasted vegetables and the framboise dessert. The quail dish consisted of a juicy roasted breast stuffed with a rich squirt of foie gras, a petite bone-in leg, and a dollop of butter parading under the guise of mashed potatoes. The dish was perfectly suited to the small plate format because of its over the top richness - a portion size any larger would have been overkill. The roasted vegetables were drenched in an unnecessary amount of herb oil and were practically inedible as a result. But the star of the table was certainly the framboise dessert, which was hands down the best dessert I've ever had. The dish featured so many different elements from the rich, creamy white chocolate, refreshingly smooth citrusy yuzu ice cream, hot tart raspberry sauce, and crispy puffs of rice, but it all came together in one hell of an elaborate plate. Even better than its over the top combination of flavors and textures was its incredibly dramatic presentation - it truly did justice to the "explosion" of flavors, textures, and temperatures packed into the dish. An absolute must order - it's something you truly have to experience yourself! 

The service and ambience were great as well. Despite a not so discreet location overlooking the MGM casino floor, the restaurant somehow had a nice breeze running throughout that gave it a refreshing al fresco vibe. :)

Overall, I'd highly recommend L'atelier, even beyond just as a lower price alternative to the real deal Joel Robuchon - from sharing a sampling of small plates to a full blown 9-course chef's tasting menu, L'atelier offers the perfect amount of luxury to whet any appetite.
