3uC7Lbc3RgUDTWQlBu4PqQ Not the best pain au chocolat I have had. It was not very flaky and seemed a little empty inside because there wasn't much layers from the dough. Could have used more chocolate filling too. But the beignet was good! The dough itself was not too sweet given the filling was. Too bad I didn't see any bread or brioche at this location or else I would have gotten it. I had some from the restaurant and loved it. The espresso here was a little too sour for my liking.
