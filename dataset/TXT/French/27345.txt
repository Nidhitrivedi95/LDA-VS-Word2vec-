It's a price fixed listed on the menu itself next to the main dishes section.  Soup or salad, entree, dessert and coffed or tea all for $19.60.  I got the soup, celery potato that day.  Tad too celery-y for me so I gave it to my dining buddy.  I got the duck confit as state above and the skin was still crisp in some spots, tender and fall of the bone in other spots.  I want to have this all the time and learn how to make it.  My dining buddy actually picked up the leg bone and chomped off the rest of the meat I couldn't get hahaha.  It comes with a bed of sauerkraut which is a bit strange but it's Alsacetian food here (hence the German influence).  I got the roasted apple, meh.  Coffee was good.

My dining buddy's: garden salad starter, basic, nothing special.  Entree of cod with wild rice, bland overall, almost tasteless.  The veggies it came with were mushy.  The flan-like dessert was soooooooo good.  Halfway through the first beer, there was a friggin fly in it.  When shown to the waiter, he simply shrugged like "Yea, and?"  He didn't even comp the second beer.  Lost major points with me there.

All in all, duck confit and flan dessert thing, all for a really good price but that's probably about it.
