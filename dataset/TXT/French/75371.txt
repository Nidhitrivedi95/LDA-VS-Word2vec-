yAuBlyZLcm_DOJjrvKoMbQ It is a "Table d'Hote" Style restaurant.... meaning you have appetizer, entree and dessert. This is a Husband (he is Chef for the main meal) and Wife (She is a pastry Chef) Team that is only open Monday to Friday...Supper service only...no weekends!

Food is delicious and portions are big so get out of there full. Cost is around $40-45 per person depending what kind of Main dish you pick!
