aW6Z4NSqEVli-xYMV3jRyg This was by far one of the best restaurants we have been to in a very long time in the Charlotte area.  We have passed Zebra many times, a friend encouraged us to try it.  So glad we did!!!!!!
The staff was excellent, the food "amazing" and anyone who knows me, knows I'm a food "snob".  After visiting San Fransisco and having the most amazing food everyday ( even from a food truck) I don't want to pay high prices for mediocre food in the Charlotte area anymore!!!!!!
The Zebra was worth every penny...
Pasta basket-Every piece of sea food in it cooked perfect, the filet, like butter!!!
Tips and Risotto - perfect
And the soufflé, absolutely perfect!!!!!!!!
Can't wait to go back and I definitely will....
