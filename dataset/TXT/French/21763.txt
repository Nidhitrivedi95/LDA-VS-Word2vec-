Bf-yMQiSmDZyqfGyFKQ0bA Finally got a chance to stop in here after many years of just not making it a priority. Nice local bar feel. It was during lunch so it wasn't too loud. Liked the decor and the setup . Enjoyed the beer selection on draft very much, great craft choices. Lots of bottles to pick from in the coolers as well. I tried the sliders of pastrami, pulled pork and brisket. Honestly the only one that was even half good was the pulled pork. All sauces were on the side if u wanted some. All sandwiches served with plain tortilla chips and smoked salsa. I didn't like the salsa in any way. It was kinda weird to me. It's now off my list of places to go.
