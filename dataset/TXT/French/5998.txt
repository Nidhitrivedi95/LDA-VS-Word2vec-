3rj1qpgFvkRWtAka17mhEQ I did not have the best experience.I visited on December 16th at about 4pm. There were not many customers. In my section a total of about 8 people. There other side of the restaurant was about the same. I ordered a brie burger and fries, and soup. My soup was great. My burgers was not cooked just right, but was cold. It took forever to get waited on and then, another forever for my food to come out. My fries seemed to be refried and the burger was microwaved.. it took less then 5 minutes to make the adjustment. But took more than 10 minutes to receive the original order.  Just not a good experience and that was my last visit.
