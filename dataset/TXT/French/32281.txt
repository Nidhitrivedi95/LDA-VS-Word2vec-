gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA It is my first review on yelp. I feel I have to say about my terrible experience in Alize. I had been there 3 years ago with my husband when we just start dating on my birthday. Then we went to Alize to celebrate our wedding cuz we just got marriage. We went to there to celebrate our special occasion cuz our experience three years ago was great. BUT today the server who serve us was just totally break our mood on special day. He DID NOT explain abt their dessert need pre order at all n I just ask him why he didnt tell me when I order.. I was lil disappointed that I cannot have the dessert what I went there for.. but I was ok.. I thought he might forget cuz it was busy today..  BUT He was very offensive to us. He kept saying he did explain to us so that is our fault. Then he brought n show us their menu n said they already explain on the menu.. so that is our fault cuz we didnt read n pay attention on every word on the menu... OMG.. what kind service of fine dining restaurant could be like that???
We were just so mad n still dont understand how he can keep his job in the restaurant.
 HIS SERVICE WAS WORSE THAN FOOD COURT ON THE STREET.
 Although the food was alright, I think there is no next time in Alize for us.
 I WILL NEVER EVER SPEND THAT MUCH MONEY FOR ALRIGHT STEAK WITH TERRIBLE SERVICE.

I HOPE WE ARE THE LAST CUSTOMER GET THE TERRIBLE SERVICE FROM Alize
