nXlKHnArL3_vugmnytsEYQ The food was absolutely amazing and just  exotic.  I loved the raspberry barbecue sauce and flank steak.  I took my parents here when they came to visit. We went to the Duck starving and ready to eat.  According to the yelp reviews it sounded awesome.  I can not emphasize enough how small the portions are.  Whatever you do do not expect a meal.  I understand the whole tapas concept and sharing of dishes however there needs to be enough food to share I don't even know how they cut the meat so thin.  It doesn't even cover 1/4 of the small salad plate the sauces are plate space fillers Not to mention you have to pay 3 dollars for a tea cup sized bowl of Italian bread.  We each ordered a hot plate 10-16 dollars a piece and all three of the appetizers for example the cheese plate,  meat sampler and the pickle sampler.  10-12 dollars each.  The restaurant is a BYOB so even though we didn't have to pay for booze I spent 185 dollars.  Including a lyft car each way.  In total I spent 225 dollars to leave just as hungry as when I got there just a little more tipsy.  Across the street is a pretty gnarly taco stand selling 2 dollar tacos... Just keep that in mind.  Let's just say I won't be going back anytime.  Except to crush some 2 dollar tacos.  Side note I signed up for yelp just to comment on this restaurant
