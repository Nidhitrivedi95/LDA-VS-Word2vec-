YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g I did the mini tasting for 2 people and it was just a lot of food. My favorite was the beef carpaccio and the truffle soup. Everything else was good, but it got really really rich really really fast. I'm more of a fan of traditional bone marrow, but I like Hubert Keller's interpretation of everything. The mini tasting pretty much hit everything I wanted to try that was available on the menu. 

Regardless, I would have given 4 stars just for that creamy white truffle soup. I'd love to just jump in a pool of this and drown in it...except I wouldn't drown because I'll eat the soup so fast.  As I type this, my mouth waters thinking about that soup. 

The dessert- beignet's were okay. I had one, and I had my friend eat the rest. I mean, he loves sweets so he liked them. I'm not a beignet fan so I wouldn't know.  The steak with the french fries were good as well. There was just a LOT of food left over! It was totally worth the money and the food the next morning was just as good. ;)
