xaqW4NkmUCGRRjmLxiFJ6Q WOW WOW WOW. Average rating of 5 stars? Had to check it out for myself. Honestly, don't know why I havent gotten around to writing a review for this place yet. Since my first visit I've become a very loyal patron. Owner and staff are soooooo welcoming and friendly. Top notch customer service.

They serve up savory AND dessert crepes. I'm proud to say as of this review I've tried almost all the savory crepes (around 75% of them). Think of Subway but infinitely better. That's this place. They don't gimp out on the ingredients at all (not to mention theyre fresh) and the crepe is well made. The big bird and the philly cheesesteak crepes are my typical go-to's. I will eventually get around to trying all the crepes on the menu (including the dessert ones). You can count on it!

Oh. One more thing. DAT SUGAR CANE JUICE BABY! It tastes great plain or with the mint, banana and strawberry mixed in. It is expensive af but importing sugar cane isnt exactly cheap so I understand. Nice and refreshing palette cleanser.

Price-wise this place is not cheap. But hey, I cant fathom getting a properly-stuffed crepe cooked to perfection anywhere else anymore. BEST CREPES IN THE CITY BAR NONE.

Every bit deserving of its five stars. Fantastic!
