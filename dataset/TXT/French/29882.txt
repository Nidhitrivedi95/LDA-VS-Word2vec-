fKDyiIcFLkl-_5d4JsvBXA This place did not disappoint! Undecided after work, we decided to head over to this gem. It screams Paris and the fact the menu is so limited you know it works. The steak was delicious as was the sauce. You could put it on anything. Wonderful salad, steak frites and profiteroles that were wonderful. 

I'd recommend this place to anyone looking for an affordable French meal. It's delicious and well worth it and centrally located to downtown. Sometimes the classics are timeless and this is definitely In that category.
