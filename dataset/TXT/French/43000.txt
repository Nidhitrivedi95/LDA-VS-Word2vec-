LQ_gYNs5E10IGFE0NOyD7A Thoroughly impressed. Food was tasty, but service even better. 

We were looking for a steakhouse in old town, but it was Friday night and the wait time was far too long at all of them. We Yelped to find another option and stumbled upon The Upton. Decided to give it a try and we were not disappointed. 

When we arrived there was a short wait, but we were greeted promptly by the hostess who warned us to watch our step (slanted doorway in old building). They offered us an opportunity to get a drink at the bar while we waited and made sure to transfer our tab to the table without us even having to ask. 

The waitress heard the order wrong for one of the people in our group (between his accent and the noisy patio, it's no big surprise there might be a mistake). When the food came out and we realized the mistake they were quick to fix the issue and even offered to comp that dish. We were not upset, nor did we ask for the dish to be comp'd, so this was a pleasant surprise. Then, they even comp'd a drink because they took so long to bring it out and had to be reminded. Again, we were not upset and did not ask for the comp. We were in no hurry and just enjoying our time. 

Finally, I was too busy talking with my friends that I ate very slowly and filled up quickly, so when the waitress noticed I hadn't eaten much of my yummy salmon, kale, and goat cheese salad she asked if my meal was okay and if I wanted something else. 

I would highly recommend this place. They strive for excellent service and it is obvious from the moment you walk in the door to the time you leave. 

In fact, I'm meeting another friend for dinner this week and recommended we meet here since I was so impressed.
