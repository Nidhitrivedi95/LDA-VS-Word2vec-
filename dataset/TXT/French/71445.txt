xcmmTXhuMx2fZF2Bt69F4w My experience is based on Sunday Brunch:

Although the food was good, it was way over priced for brunch.  Coming from DC, I've experience much better brunch cafe's that included bottomless (insert alcoholic brunch drunk here) and cheaper - which says a lot comparing Pittsburgh to DC.  

I'd go back, but it's not on the top of my list.
