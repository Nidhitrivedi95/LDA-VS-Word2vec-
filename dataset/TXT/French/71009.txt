xcmmTXhuMx2fZF2Bt69F4w I love the cute neighborhood of Point Breeze and Point Brugge is a perfect place to try out when exploring this Pittsburgh neighborhood (it is my neighbor so I'm not bias or anything!).  They are not opened on Mondays and do not take reservations. We went on a Tuesday night and there was about a 20 minute wait for a table for four (the place is very small inside). We grabbed some drinks at the bar and they have a great list of draft and bottled beers. They had one of my favorites,  Blueberry from Bar Harbor Brewing which I went with.  We were quickly seated and I ordered the flatbread option which had sliced apples and brie-it was in the small plates section but large enough for an entrée. My date had to try the mussels (that is what they are known for) and went with the tomato sauce/garlic/brussel sprout sauce which looked delicious. We also ordered the chicken skewers which were just ok. Our friends ordered the salmon which they enjoyed as well as the apple tart for dessert which was huge! I also recommend their brunch on Sundays.
