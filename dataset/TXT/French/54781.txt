rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw Really enjoyed Bardot for lunch. Love that whipped softened butter that they serve with the crispy baguette. I ordered their escargot, which was very delicious as well. Secondly I ordereed the lobster Benedict. It was well prepared but not my favorite. I just think the lobster flavor overpowered everything in it. Still I would return to try more on the menu. I liked the service and ambiance and the food showed a lot of promise.
