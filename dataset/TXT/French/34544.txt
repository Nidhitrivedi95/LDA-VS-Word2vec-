HojKatUfX4UHWaPqtl63NQ We waited all summer to see what they were doing with the miX Restaurant at Delano/Mandalay Bay... Well, we were not disappointed!  We too started with cocktails at Skyfall, then proceeded to Rivea for an amazing dinner.  The socca and panisse were delicious, and such a fun interpretation of chickpeas (we love them in all forms!). I am crazy about the mushroom risotto, and enjoyed the luscious lobster and artichoke salad.  The lobster claws were HUGE, just splayed across the salad!  Husband had the John Dory, which was delightful, though our favorite was the Pepper Crusted Bison Tenderloin! WOW!  The service was impeccable, and the wine was paired perfectly!  We loved Rivea, and can't wait to go back! 

PS Love the remodel, so much depth to the space now!
