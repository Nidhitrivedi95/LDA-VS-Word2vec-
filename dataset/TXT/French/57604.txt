rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Finally had a chance to try this restaurant!! I always stay in Venetian when I go to Vegas but never had a chance to eat here. So glad I did though! It's French, fancy and quiet. We ordered oysters, crab and seafood. They were delicious! Service was fast and friendly which is expected when you eat here. Can't wait to go back!
