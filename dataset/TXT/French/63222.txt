SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA On our visit to Cleveland I wanted to try all the good restaurants here. Based on recommendations from Chowhound.com we ate at Lola, Crop Bistro, Moxie, and L'Albatros. We loved all of them especially Crop. L'Abatros is one of our very good experience. The food was of high quality and most of all the services were excellent. I did not like the french onion soup, I thought it was salty, the owner or manager came out and took care of it right away. He took the soup back, I ordered the foie gras/ pate instead and it was very good, there were more pate than I could finish, I had to save room for my main course. I ordered the "Pied de cochon" which is a sausage-like dish, it was very very fatty, interesting but not that impressed. My son ordered the steak and it was excellent. We ordered the chocolate brownie and the Napoleon for desert. I would recommend the chocolate brownie but not the Napoleon ( just OK ). The overall experience was very positive, the waitress was very attentive and pleasant. I would reccommend this restaurant strongly. I saw other items on the menu that I would try if I come back. Being out of town I am glad I chose L'Albatros. You will not regret, if I come back to Cleveland I will definitely come to this place again.
