4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Second day in LV, we started with a nice brunch at Mon Ami Gabi @ Paris Hotel. The patio was fully packed, but we wanted to seat inside anyway. Very nice, warm, cozy decor inside, it does remind us of Paris restaurant.

Nice grand entrance! Inside was pretty full too. Nice warm, cozy French decor.

Really enjoyed their complimentary French Baguette - served warm, crusty outside and soft inside, perfect!

French Toast - thick piece of french toast served with blueberries and warm blueberry syrup and whipped cream. I really like the blueberry syrup, real blueberry taste!

Egg Benedict - with Canadian bacon and hollandaise sauce. I've had better Benedict, so this one is nothing to wow.

Seafood Crepe - very very fresh seafood, especially the scallop! Not a bad choice.
