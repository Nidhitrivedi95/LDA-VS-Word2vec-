K67pkQljTFTW_P-7xUQrFw Charming place, great menu, nice to BYOW. The escargots are a favorite starter, and their main courses are prepared with care and always delicious. And the prices are surprisingly reasonable, even with the crummy exchange rates for USD. I try to go for dinner here at least once when I am in Montreal.
