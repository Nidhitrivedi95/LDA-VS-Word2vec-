hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA The Baguette Cafe is one of the best-kept secrets in town!!!

It's secretly hidden from your view unless you venture to the back of the office park on West Sunset Road, northwest of the 215 and Buffalo Drive.

The baguettes, on which the sandwiches are served on is baked in-house. They are very light, crusty and buttery. My favorite sandwich is the "Prosciutto" which consists of mixed greens, prosciutto, tomatoes, and blue cheese spread.
I have had fantastic Quiche in many different French Cafes in Las Vegas, but Baguette Cafe surpasses them of all. It's fluffy, creamy, and very satisfying, the secret is in the flour and  temperature control. 
Don't leave without trying the torte, the chocolate and the mixed fruit taste heavenly.

Olivier is an amazing host, very nice and humble!!
On occasion, I'll mildly observe peoples interactions with him and he's always puts smiles on peoples faces. He genuinely cares about his customers, and the regulars feel that positive vibe thus express the appreciation. 
The prices are very reasonable, you won't be disappointed.

This cafe is definitely worth checking out!!!
