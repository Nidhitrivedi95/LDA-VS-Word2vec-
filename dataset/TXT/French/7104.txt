4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw My favorite restaurant on the strip! I visit this place every time I'm in Vegas. It's a French restaurant with breakfast lunch and dinner. It's pricy but good. They have the outdoor patio seating but it's very good. I honestly prefer inside the green room. Plus there's hardly a wait for in door.
