M8r8_asmCqkcn9g23G7d9Q I was super excited to try this teeny-weeny bakery after reading all the amazing reviews.However, I was a bit underwhelmed -- I came in for their famous almond croissant and  some coffee. Now , the almond croissant was unlike any croissant I had ever tasted -- it had the texture of a madeleine  (soft, cakey) and some outer flakiness associated with a croissant. I found the filling was very good but wanted there to be a bit more in the croissant. The outer crust was delicious! I really did like the texture and flavors of the croissant but it was nothing extraordinary. My low rating is mostly due to the TRAGIC latte I received. It was literally watered down coffee with milk. No froth. no strong espresso. Just really sad, and too overpriced for the quality! 

I would recommend trying the pastries for sure, and stopping by for the cuteness of the cafe, but the coffee is disappointing.
