Ours are, and total meltdown was only averted by the wonderful attentions of the handsome waiter who brought my 5 year old daughter unadorned cheese curds.  The children were graciously welcomed and treated extremely well, but unless yours are adventurous eaters, you'll need to feed them elsewhere.
