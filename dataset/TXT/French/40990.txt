kcF-en40P3J9L8nLy5lKqQ Went last night with another couple. 
Food: I had steak frites, steak was about 4 ounces, cooked perfect but so small. Fries were soggy. Side salad was awful.
Fiancé had pasta, not homemade and just bland. Other couple ordered the half chicken and that looked fantastic and she said was excellent. He ordered the duck, was good but again small portions.

Service- slow but a friendly waiter.

Note: manager is a bit creepy, likes to come up to all the women and ask if "everything ok" in the middle of dinner service. We thought that was extremely odd and you can see the other diners looking a bit jilted by it as well.

Interior- very nicely done and sharp. A NY feel to it, downside it's very loud and hard to have a discussion without raising your voice.

Drinks and wine- cocktails they make are fantastic. Wine list is not extensive but well done. A bit pricey wine per glass.

Prices: a tad high for the quality and portion size.

Reservations at 7- sat right away, food arrived at 8:15, left at 9. Kitchen needs to get act together.

Overall: it's "decent" at best. Hopefully they will improve and work out kinks.
