mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q We were able to grab a reservation the night before flying out to Vegas so booking is not terribly difficult. We opted for the 9 course tasting menu and everything was pretty good, but I think it's a little bit too decadent for a tasting menu. My palette never really got a break and it was quite overwhelming by the end.

My favorite course was the roasted langoustine which was cooked perfectly and had a beautiful buttery texture that just melts in your mouth. This was accompanied by a fantastic fennel salad.

My second favorite was the seared kampachi which was both light but complex at the same time.

I wasn't a big fan of the duck foie gras. The texture wasn't my favorite as I like my foie grilled and it was a little too big a piece of foie for a tasting menu. I know I don't have to eat all of it but I felt compelled since I was shelling out some big bucks for the meal.

Overall, it was a good experience and I've always wanted to try one of Joel Robuchon's restaurants but I can't say it was one of the better tasting menus or Michelin restaurants that I've been to.
