O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q I really want to give this a 5, but I just can't.  It was delicious, it was great. It just wasn't quite a $60 steak. And I have to admit, I like the Mac n cheese from the froofy grocery store by my house better. The service was really phenomenal, maybe if we'd ordered something else.
