SJo_IjvzdRtCvZVN0cbrRQ The mimosa was great.  I will blame the freshly squeezed oj but I can honestly say it was the best I ever had. I got the biscuits and gravy and the boyfriend got chicken and waffles. The biscuits and gravy came with a cheesy biscuits (huge) a side of meat eggs to your liking and potatoes. The biscuits and gravy were so good. The flavor was a little different but just enough to grab and hold my attention. The eggs were so flavorful naturally my bacon was good. It a little under cooked for my liking so I didn't eat much of it. The potatos were nothing special. They put beets in with them kinda threw me off.  The chicken and waffles were very good.  The chicken was seasoned nicely and the waffles were packed with flavor.  I saw a lot in the menu that I wanted to try.  I can't wait to go back
