j0baDQfMAGDm_QGdFMmb-Q Went in late on a Saturday evening just wanting to split a dish because it was 8:30pm the service was excellent and the food was so delicious. We split the salmon crepes that all i can say is it's a must try!! The ambience was quaint and we loved that the chef came out to ask how we liked our meal which was a nice touch. 
We will be back and look forward to trying some other items on the menu.
