uTCOEqjuVAXUOzti5TWj2Q I wouldn't go out my way to visit this place again. The crepes reminded me of food you'd buy from a food truck- they use a little portable grill in the front to cook them like they do at the farmers market we visit. Crepes were ok, but if you stuff anything with nutella and cookies, can you really go wrong? We also tried a quiche ($13) and were unimpressed- it tasted like a quiche you might buy at trader joes and microwave. It came with a salad, which was only spring mix with a vinaigrette on it- no vegetables or cheese or anything on it. Food took a long time, despite it not being very busy. Everyone at the table was served at different times as well, so some of us sat and waited while others ate.
