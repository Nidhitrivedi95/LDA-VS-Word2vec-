oS96aJIHFWcFAlGHKKXjaw One of my favorite in Pittsburgh! We always go there try something new every time we go to lawrenceville! One of our every time must get is there macrons. But everything else we've tried so far we're all so great! I doubt that we will ever be disappointed for any desert they offer. Every time we go, there was a line waiting but it was never crazy that we had to wait in line for 10-20minutes. But this line usually takes around or less than 5 minutes, which I would need some time to think what do we want any way. The service was always good, the stuff are always friendly and helpful. It is a place that you have to check it out if you love deserts!
