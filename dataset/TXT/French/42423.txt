lcTa0q9Wo4wNyLCIgWFRUA Sunday night and super quiet, 8 people in the whole restaurant. The bar on the other side seemed to have more of a buzz.The Habs had a home game so maybe that had something to do with it? Still, it had a relaxed and warm atmosphere. We ordered the beef tartare as an app. We had it spicy. 80g portion was good for sharing. If you've never had tartare and want to try it for the first time this would be a good choice. It had more stuff (parsley, onion, lemon) than other Tartares I've had and didn't look/taste as 'raw' - it was tasty- would get again. We also had the duck confit. Portion size was adequate as an entree. I thought it looked and tasted a bit dry but D said he was happy with it. I ordered the scallops and pork belly. When the server brought it out, I was shocked at how small the portion was. Ummm,  $32. For 2 scallops resting on 2 small pieces of pork belly???? Anywhoo, I ate it veeery slowly and I have to say all of the flavours were amazing! The sweet, salty, smoky and the crunchy and smooth textures of all the ingerients were a true delight. One more scallop and pork belly on the plate would have been perfect for the price point (I'm not a pig, but I'm no bird either and I don't care much for dessert). If u do order dessert you'll probably be full. Service was okay, food came out in a timely manner. No one really checked on us, so I wasn't really feelin' the love, but no biggie.
