WOj8nPos3R9IIf0Pyttd8g Lulu is probably our favorite restaurant in Charlotte.  The ambiance is truly perfect - white tablecloths and very attentive servers perfect for a romantic evening but still casual enough for a family or group of friends.  Brunch is not too be missed. Mussels and frites are awesome. We once had an overcooked steak but it was recooked without question. Everything else we've ever had at Lulu has been outstanding. And the owner and staff go above and beyond to make sure that all of their customers are enjoying themselves. I love it at Lulu.
