ME6D5nLlfG0xZCtICOYDuw I LOVE French-inspired Brasserie's - but this really was a let down, particularly in terms of service - and followed by lackluster interior design.

Stopped for a Happy Hour and was looking forward to some appetizers, but the indifferent bartender made me question why I'd want to stay, and the tepid greeting form the hostesses set the stage.  My buddy and I had 3 drinks each, but ordered no food.

The interior just fell flat design-wise.  Cheap, minimalist and uninspired.  Maybe I'm comparing the execution to Stephen Starr's Parc on Philadelphia's Rittenhouse Square, and that might not be fair - because that is sort of the Gold Standard for the concept.  But, c'mon guys, warm this place up a little.  Give it some gravitas.  I want the owner's to look at Petite Chou in Indianapolis as a example of a great crowd-pleasing menu for breakfast/lunch/dinner/deserts with a rather minimalist interior/exterior (hint: not expensive - but damn, it works here and it could inspire Charlotte). I would not go back, not did I think it was worth visiting - except for a nice location.
