FJMMPL3pxAPYGEPB0Hwlhw One of the best places to "see and be seen" in Toronto, and one of the few places I and my friends go out of the way to make a yearly pilgrimage to.

TOCA is the Toronto Ritz-Carlton's signature restaurant, and it is one of the most interesting and classiest places to visit during the Toronto International Film Festival. Walk in here any day the festival runs and you're bound to see celebrities. George Clooney has frequented both this and the Ritz bar near the front of the hotel. Agents and reps from various film studios meet here to finalize deals for movies. It's a frequent site for people of all types to hang out and converse all things film-related.

I have been here many times over the years, and love the ambience and relaxed (but busy) atmosphere the restaurant provides. I have fond memories of hanging out here with coworkers and a pair of nice actresses we met at a party down the road, and enjoying vodka tonics as we talked about the entertainment industry.

The prices are also pretty reasonable, at least as far as drinks and snacks are concerned.

Also, if anyone from the restaurant is reading this, I apologize for the following:

1) Sneaking in the back door of the restaurant after getting turned away when I tried to walk in the front door.
2) Borrowing a Sharpie from one of the hostesses so I could draw a symbol on my hand so I could bluff my way into a Hello Canada party.
3) Fanboying over various celebrities and stars. It was a momentary thing, I swear.

That is all. If you're in Toronto, you owe it to yourself to check out TOCA. Come here on a warm summer's night and I can guarantee you'll have an amazing time.
