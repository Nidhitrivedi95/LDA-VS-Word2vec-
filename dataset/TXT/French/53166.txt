QeFsIMcIFIJcOrpthYL8jg Honestly, i was slightly dissapointed. There was no live band when i was there! That's 75% of the reason i wanted dinner here. I didn't go for Valentine's day, but was just so surprised that there wasn't live music. Other than that i loved it. I got the lamb shank with almond crust, and the apple pie for dessert. It was a whole baked apple with filo dough. So good. Maybe next some live music?
