rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw I'm going to start by saying a big portion of my rating is due to the atmosphere here... No, I probably shouldn't rate a place so highly based on that. But, this restaurant is truly beautiful and I felt classy as hell eating here! From the beautiful bar to the awesome waitress, it all was one pleasant picture.

For the food itself, it was good, but it didn't blow my mind. I ordered their sea bass based on a recommendation and again, good, but not sure I'd ever return specifically for that dish. I thought the lemon was a bit too overpowering. I did enjoy the cheese platter that we ordered though and their bread/butter is truly scrumptious! Their cocktails are also great. I think overall, I would definitely be back since the experience itself was lovely. I would just be sure to branch out and try something else the next time around.
