KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA So I came here with my now husband for our anniversary about a year ago. This is where he proposed to me! (Well by the lake lol) He called ahead and asked them to seat us away from people, which they did not! We talked to the host about the seating issue and they were kind enough to seat us at the top bar like seats! It was dark so they brought candles which made it really romantic! We started off with a caesars salad, then they accidentally made an extra one so they gave us one on the house. I ordered the king salmon which was full of flavor and really good! My hubby got the lobster pasta which was also really delicious !   Overall the service was good, food was great! I don't like wine, but their wine selection is huge!!!!
