aaWhSHpsE285eaSTzDxAMA Beyond horrific!!!! The service is lousy, and my order was wrong when I went there for dinner with my aunt. The chef offered to buy me dinner to come back. I planned to meet with him next week and write a favorable article about the restaurant for a local newspaper. I called him to make an appointment. The ASSHOLE who answers the phone treated me like garbage, hung up on me, told me he's not chef's secretary. I called back and asked when chef would be in and he said, "Who the hell knows? That's the problem. I have other paying customers on the line so hurry up already." I told him to drop dead and hung up. I will NEVER patronize this establishment and any review I would do would be unfavorable. No apology. No nothing. Wow. Really? I have taken clients there and family members. I have brought them business and planned to go for lunch next week for a business lunch. This place will never see me again unless it's my middle finger.
