nk9lP-iXi7xklwN3VYf6Ew Well -- this is actually for the Bar side of the Senses restaurant.

First off -- it is not an inexpensive place but both the food and wine were great.

Good ambiance -- not too loud music -- wonderful for catching up with friends and actually being able to talk!

Modern decor and comfortable.  
We had the burgers and frites and I have to say, while the burger was on the expensive side, it was definitely one of the best I have ever had in the city!  It had portbello mushroom cap, bacon and cheese on it with the othr fixings.  Yummy!

So, if you are looking for a nice place to have a bite with friends, with a city vibe and cool modern decor, look no further than Senses bar.  

PS the restaurant has some great offerings, but you will definitely find it even more expensive.  Worthy of a special night out (say anniversary celebration etc).
