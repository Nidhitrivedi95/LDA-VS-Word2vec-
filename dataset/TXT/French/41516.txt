So it probably helps when you have a friend's uncle who happens to be a millionaire that is paying for the entire meal, i.e. getting to order whatever appetizer, entree, and dessert I want without worrying about the cost and having some damn nice wine, dessert wine, and digestif along with it. 

That being said, the quality of food was excellent.  I got the a foie gras dish for the appetizer, a calf liver dish for the entree, and a deconstructed peach thing for dessert - none disappointed.  And though I wasn't paying for the meal, I still did look at the price of the food and it seemed fairly reasonable for what I was getting. 

Service was attentive and the sommelier was knowledgeable as well.
