Chef Matt Carter has done such a tremendous job of providing a consistently outstanding menu.

Last night we enjoyed a family birthday dinner and had our usual wonderful experience.  My starter was the Spinach Frisée Salad (for me, sans Frisée).  Delicious.  

My wife's entree was the Diver Scallops, Rock Shrimp, Corn and Chorizo Risotto...and it was perfectly prepared.  Mine was the Prime Flatiron Steak and again, perfect temperature, flavorful and delicious.  The brandy peppercorn sauce is so delicious that I always ask for a little extra.

We finished up with a Chocolate Soufflé with the Grand Marnier Sauce.  The rich, creamy, chocolate marnier sauce on the Soufflé was amazing.

Other items we have had here that are also phenomenal include the Onion Soup, the Pinot Braised Short Ribs, the Dungeness Crab Crepe and the Pate Maison.

Bottom line, you cannot go wrong at Zinc Bistro.  Also, a shout out to our regular waiter Frankie.  He has been there for years and is an absolute delight.  Frankie, you rock!
