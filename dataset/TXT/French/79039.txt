The food is great and the ingredients are all really fresh and tasty, but perhaps it depends on what you order. My party of eight all had lunch... sandwiches, burgers, and salads. And everyone was super happy. The vibe is nice and clean, lighting is bright, and I super heart the gorgeous blue water glasses. Only negative point was the keno girl didn't come to my table and I think she should thus be fired for preventing me from becoming a millionaire.
