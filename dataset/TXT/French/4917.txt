33Tr0eRki1Yamzleu4GMdw In a town where people are always in a rush, it's refreshing to discover a cafe that's designed to make you relax and savior your food!

According to Jonathan who is the owner he told me his dishes are inspired from his childhood home in France dishes like Chevre Salad, Quiche, Croquettes and sandwiches made on freshly baked French bread. 

I've been here quite a few times and these are the things I've tried:
The Nord sandwich is popular which consists of smoked salmon, capers, sweet onion and cucumber it was simply fabulous and healthy.  
The Quiches are light, fluffy and delicious. 
The Gazpacho soup is awesome, i can eat this everyday! 
(Soup Verte) avocado, cucumber, zucchini, onion bell pepper and basil). 

The staff was friendly and provided great customer service.
Jonathan is a terrific host, very nice person, we got along pretty fast.    
I told him I read his story in the paper and it's what made me drive to his cafe. 
He was so pleased, he explained to me in detail how the name Rosallie came about, it was the name of the landowner who sold the farm house from his homeland Southern France.
The name brought luck to his parents, so that's why he named the cafe Rosallie.  
Conversations like that is why I comeback to his cafe, I just like meeting great people!

Rosallie is an wonderful cafe and I recommend this place to anybody!
