xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g We went here for lunch during restaurant week and I couldn't be more excited! We had a perfect table near the window overlooking the Bellagio, the pre fix menu was an app, steak and dessert. I'm not a steak eater but it was cooked to perfection, and the peach tart with basil ice cream was delicious. Service was excellent. I can't wait to come back & try dinner, the views will be just as good.
