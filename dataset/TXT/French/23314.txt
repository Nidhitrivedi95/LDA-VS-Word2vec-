C3PVq7UpeHd6nz1_e-AtkA How cute is Kalendar?? Everytime I walk by (almost every day), I feel some sort of invisible force urging me to go inside. It's just one of those inviting, cozy places, and also has prime patio space which is usually packed in the summer. 

This is a place where you could enjoy a romantic date inside,  bring your mom for brunch on the patio, or sip coffee by yourself and read the paper at a window seat. Their menu is very appealing with choices grouped off (naans, "scrolls", etc.). All I remember is that I had something with goat cheese and it was delicious. All of their dishes seem like relatively healthy options as well (just salads for sides here!)

The service was friendly and efficient, and the prices are pretty reasonable for what I consider to be a classy but casual place. Kalendar doesn't disappoint!
