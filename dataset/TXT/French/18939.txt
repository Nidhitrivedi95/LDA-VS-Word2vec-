An_U8woQkFVsMqVblkImZQ This place is absolutely beautiful. With the flowered decor pieces on the ceiling and by the pastry counter, to their paintings and general interior decor.. just so romantic and appealing to the eye. I sat down to try their grapefruit champagne parfait. It was plated with passion fruit (?) syrup and berries on the side. The dessert itself was encased in white chocolate. Presentation was on par with the feel of the restaurant. Fancy and classy. Only downside it that it's pretty expensive ($8.50 for one). 

Note that this place will be closing as of November 1, 2016. The waitress said they'll probably open up a new location after a few months. I would like to try their regular menu items before then.
