jLxeBgWhLRbII2ACkgH1Sg Today boyfriend and I came to pick up some macarons to go. By the way, the macarons are TO DIE FOR! At checkout we were offered a fresh baguette to go by the owner. As soon as we got home we decided to slice up the baguette and shoot in the oven for 10 min, and let me tell you... that baguette was unbelievably fresh and delicious! Crispy on the outside and warm & fluffy on the inside. The best baguette I've ever had! La Belle Terre you never cease to amaze me with your quality! I highly recommend!
