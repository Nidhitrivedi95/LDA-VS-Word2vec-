ChwyMZi_eZlMfL9qpXH_zw I had an awful experience here. I went yesterday ( on a Wednesday ) around 11:45 am. The waitress took our order, and then 20 minutes later she came back and said she lost the paper with our order and took it all over again. It took another 20 minutes to get our coffees. It took 1 hour to get our food, which was cold. First, my eggs Benedict with smoked salmon came, without the smoked salmon. Then, she took it back. It came back 2 minutes later with the salmon on it. My friend sat there without food. Mine was cold and mediocre. Next, my fruit bowl arrived. Another 5 minutes later my friends plate arrived. I was missing my potatoes. I asked for them. It took another 10 minutes. I was now finished my meal, and as I'm sure you would guess, I was quite annoyed. I told her to forget about the potatoes and we left very disappointed about our experience. There are WAY better options. No need to try this place.
