rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Pretty good overall.


 Excellent chicken, but the highlight was the SUPERB wine recommendation from their resident wine guy [there is a special name for these people, which I never remember..] This was my favorite bottle of wine EVER, and as soon as I find the label [they peeled the label off the bottle and gave it to me] I will post it for communal enjoyment!


 One star off for the Absinthe disaster - I was telling the bartender that the de-wormwooded Absinthe is undrinkable, because it tastes like pure anise. The bartender SWORE that they had an excellent tasting version he was SO WRONG! I repeat - I do NOT enjoy drinking pure anise extract, even with ample sugar and water added! Looking at the absinthe cloud when you pour in the water from a special carafe over a sugar cube placed on a special perforated spoon does not make up for the taste!
