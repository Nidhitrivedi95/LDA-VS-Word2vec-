f4vb5tv60WaBcwzRhKpANA Great place. It's fairly new but the food is awesome. I got the Italian panini. It was a foot long and amazing. I had no idea what Italian ham was but it tastes like prosciutto. It also comes with a side salad and drink. This cost $9 so I think the prices are definitely reasonable. They also offered us some amazing pasteries. I recommend those too. 

The staff is very friendly, overly accommodating, and gave me samples of a few things. 

The menu has about 14-16 items on it which is good. 6 are sandwiches, 5 are salads, two are n build your own salad or sandwich, one is soup, and the rest are. small side things like bread, chips, and soda. This eliminates the confusion of too much on the menu. 

I recommend this place for a nice, quiet lunch.
