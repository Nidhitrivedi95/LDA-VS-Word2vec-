eJ9L40jm5VOXCIq7xs9kQw My wife and I had dinner here our last night in Montreal. It was perfect. We chose the Table d'hote menu. My wife had the mixed green salad, the beef with garden vegetables, and chocolate mousse. I had marinated scallops with cucumbers, rock fish with garden vegetables, and creme brulee. Each dish was prepared flawlessly. 

The service was also flawless. We were greeted graciously, and taken care of all through the evening with friendly professionalism. 

You should eat here if you are in Montreal.
