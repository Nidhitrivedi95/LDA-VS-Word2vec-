HHvO4MgBFabsmlInou6viQ Had an excellent meal on a Thursday night. Was busy but not overrun with customers. As such, nice vibe. Service was attentive but not over-bearing. Noise level which seems to matter to me more and more, was comfortable. We could hear each other talk without straining. Very European. 

Sardines on housemade potato salad starter was excellent. Both mains were satisfying. Duck confit in particular.  Nice selection of wine. 

Looking forward to going back to the the Sunday night prix fix.
