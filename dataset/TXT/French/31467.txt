gjCmXkMNVE0JSk8puUwv6g I was in town for a family emergency and I was trying to find a healthy place to eat nearby. This place had some good reviews so we thought we would try it. Unfortunately it ended up being a giant waste of money. It really was way too pricey for what it was. We ended up spending $70 for what was essentially deli food on an IKEA plate. The water had floaters in it. The coffee tasted like it came out of a keurig. It was just not worth it at all. 2 stars for the decor and overpriced tiramisu.
