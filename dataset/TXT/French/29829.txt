FJMMPL3pxAPYGEPB0Hwlhw 2.5/5! Overpriced and not that great. I was very disappointed. The rack of lambs was okay (definitely had better) and the Ravioli was nothing special. The only dish that I was impressed with was the Risotto. Overall, I think there are better restaurants in the area that this venue.
