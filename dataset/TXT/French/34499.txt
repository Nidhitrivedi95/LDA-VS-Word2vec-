HOev_2CifUcfIm9xDL_uaw First off, VERY unassuming.  Could barely find the place.  Walk in, not much to write home about.  Kitschy, bland decor.  I will say we were a bit nervous we made a bad decision.  We ordered and the food was served...err, I dunno...    

First bite.......I just couldn't believe it.  A simple dish like quiche Lorraine never tasted so good.  Even texture was unlike any quiche I have ever had.  To be honest, I actually think about it from time to time and can't wait to go back.  

We also got a crepe. It was savory but can't remember which one we got but it was also really good.  It wasn't on the breakfast menu because we asked if we could get something off the lunch menu even though it was before the lunch hours.  

I cannot wait to go back!
