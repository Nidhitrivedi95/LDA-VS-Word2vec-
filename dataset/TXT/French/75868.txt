ynYEgNimJOyb8dvyr9x0sA We stopped in for dessert crepes after having dinner at another establishment.  The dining room was fairly empty but having read all of the positive reviews on here, we weren't deterred.  We were sat at a bar in front of the crepe station and got to watch the chef as she made savory and sweet crepes.  Everything looked amazing.  I had the salted caramel and chocolate crepe and it was phenomenal.  The portion was large enough for 2.

After watching the chef prepare other diners meals, and seeing the owner flambé cheese in a way I've never seen before, I definitely want to come back for dinner.  Hot molten cheese does it for me, every time.
