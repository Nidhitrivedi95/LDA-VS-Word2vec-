4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Outdoor seating is great for people watching and seeing the Bellagio Fountains.  Mon Ami Gabi was a family affair before seeing our show at the Rio.  It was a great reminder of my recent trip to Paris.  Some of the food was just fantastic, but others lacked flavor.  
As a party of five, we started off with a carafe of "Frangria," which was fantastic!  Then had three different appetizers to share:  Warm Brie Cheese, Warm Duck Confit Salad, and the Mussels Mariniere. Two Onion Soups au Gratin.  Then for our individual entrees we ordered:  Frisee & Warm Bacon Salad, Steak Classique, Bone-in Ribeye, Sea Scallops, "Poisson du Jour" = Sea Bass w/ Roasted Corn Couscous.  Being so full, we still had room for dessert...(drum roll please)... Bananas Foster Crepe.  
In summary, here's what I would definitely get again and what items I would pass up.  
Five Stars:  Frangria, Mussels Mariniere (so memorable!), Warm Brie Cheese--was finished off, but I personally didn't have any because I'm not a cheese person, Frisee & Warm Bacon Salad (yummy poached egg!), Bone-in Ribeye (perfectly cooked and juicy), Sea Scallops, Bananas Fosters Crepe
Faaaaahget about it:  Warm Duck Confit Salad (supbar duck confit to the ones served in Paris--lacked salt/flavor), Onion Soup (not impressive--didn't have a depth of flavor was was too sweet, plus the cheese wasn't gooey), Steak Classique (ehhh....least the fries were good)
