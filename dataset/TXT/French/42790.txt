LjOBNcNNpuewBqSPxYYTJQ We visited this Amelie's location for treats for my birthday. Everything in the case is so incredibly beautiful. So fun to shop with your eyes. The young man helping us was very nice and helped explain several items to us. We selected our items and had them packaged to go. 

Verdict. Macarons were the best thing we purchased - as has been the case on previous visits. The cinnamon sugar with chocolate filling is just divine. The rest of our choices were okay to bad. My husband had a chocolate cupcake/small cake that was pretty okay. My son chose a similar sized cake with white cake and strawberries. Big disappointment. First, the glazed strawberry on top was moldy!  Yup. Moldy!  There was no mold on the icing, but I cut around that part anyway. The cake flavor was very good. The buttercream is not to my liking at all!!!  I've tried it on a previous visit and thought maybe we had a bad batch. No. I completely understand that french pastries are often not as sweet as US versions, but this buttercream tastes like it has zero sugar. It basically just tastes like butter/fat. Given that the item was refrigerated, the icing is solidified and the mouth feel is identical to butter. Very off putting. Lastly, my other son's chocolate eclair was fine. Not great. Not bad either. 

All in all, considering the price, I will stick with a macaron if I visit Amelie's again.
