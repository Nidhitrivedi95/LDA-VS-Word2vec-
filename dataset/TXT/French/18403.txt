A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g Although the service was good, I don't think the food deserved more than two stars. I ordered two large chocolate and almond croissants and three regular chocolate filled croissants. I took them home and discovered that the large croissants were just dark colored almond croissants with no chocolate or chocolate flavor to be found. The chocolate filled croissants had small spots of chocolate inside, definitely not filled. I ate at Kneaders last week and their croissants have at least twice the amount of chocolate filling. 
 It was a unique experience, but I feel I can get a better value elsewhere.
