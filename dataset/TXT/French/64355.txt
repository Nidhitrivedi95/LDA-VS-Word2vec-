tCSlpwJQ4CZsUEMZeH2SFg This is and will remain one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte. The food, atmosphere, and service are almost always perfect. I just will not order the lump crabmeat salad again...it arrived, a beautiful mixed greens salad, with a tiny mold (about the size of an individual serving can of cat food) of bits of crabmeat...distinctly not "lump". It is a pricey salad, as you would expect, but I think they are making too much profit on this one. Definitely not worth the money.  Cafe Monte...you can do better!
