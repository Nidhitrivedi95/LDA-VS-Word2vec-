gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg I had the french pizza thing, and it was pretty good.  Other people's food looked nice as well.  Overall the place is alright, and the prices are fair for a glorified bar downtown.  You won't leave hungry as the portions are nice.  It's a neat place to check out and its a microbrew, but it didn't impress me much.  It's good for groups who want to have some beers and grab a bite.
