EEIz44ewHhOKmfTloAK13g Extremely small bite restaurant. Didn't find their dishes that creative.  The featured beef dish wasn't cooked as ordered. Service was slightly inexperienced, especially the wine service. The red wine ordered was served too warm. Ambiance was uninspiring and please note the restaurant had poor signage. Enjoy Toronto.
