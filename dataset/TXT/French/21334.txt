B56AYe5GNuavMDtwFsXqzA I was so excited to eat here.
So excited!  Now I'm disappointed.   Crushed even.

Came here for Valentine's Day.
It was my suggestion.  I am to blame.

They had a prix fixe menu of 
Lobster bisque
Shrimp cocktail (which they ran out of, so they substituted the Coquilles St Jaques instead)
Beef Wellington with chateaubriand sauce
Chocolate Souffle

Sounds delicious no?  NO!

Gahhhhh

The lobster bisque was tasteless.  It tasted like pink tinted creme.  And I love lobster bisque.  Anywhere that sells it, I get it, and this bisque was terrible.

The Coquilles St Jacques... inedible.  I felt like I was eating mashed ritz crackers swimming in a pool of butter with lots of apples.  Gross.

The beef wellington... well... this was the best thing we had all evening.  The beef was terribly tough though, and tasted a it off.  The pastry and spread around the beef was delicious though.  The chateaubriand was not rich, and was yet again... tasteless.

The chocolate souffle was the worst.  I didn't even get a hint of chocolate.  It was like.... really soggy french toast in a cup without any syrup.  Soggy bread.  Gross.

We informed our server how disappointed we were by the souffle, so he was kind enough to bring us chocolate creme brulees instead.  While these brulees were better..... sigh.

We really didn't like it.
I would have rather ate at soooooooooo many other places.
I was trying to avoid a chain, and all the cliche Valentine's Day stuff, but this place was so awful, I could cry.

It's Valentine's Day, and this place's food made me want to cry.

I will not ever, ever, ever even consider going back.
Barf.
