rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Full disclosure -- my comments are colored because of the thirty minute wait we had for a table that we had reserved six weeks earlier...and here, in customer-friendly Las Vegas, nobody at the restaurant offered to buy us a drink, an appetizer, a dessert...no action other than repeated (and snarky) apologies as though we should be privileged to wait for a table at their establishment.

The menu is high end bistro and loos excellent.  Food was good but not outstanding; our party enjoyed their salads but my short ribs -- a special -- were overcooked.  Wine list was, predictably for a Vegas restaurant at this price point, very nice if marked up obscenely (but one knows what one is getting in to).

All in, rate it "fine" with a black mark for the late table and the smugness of it...at this price point I'd have expected "excellent," and not just "fine."
