I love brunch but I am not always a morning person, especially on the weekends. After a few failed attempts, I finally made it one weekend, and Im glad that I had the opportunity to eat here. I ordered the classic french toast and added strawberries ($9 total), which I think made it a lot better because the french toast by itself might have been a bit plain. 

The pieces were really thick and decently filling. Typically I do not like to eat things that are overly sweet and more subtle in flavor, and the french toast here is kind of like that. I actually ended up using most if not all of of the whipped cream and syrup, which is typically rare for me.

I also ordered the Nutella Hot Chocolate Cappuccino which I didn't particularly like... I guess this one was a bit too plain and I was expecting it to be a bit sweeter or have more flare. Didn't think the drink was worth $2.50.  

Not the cheapest place so I wouldn't eat here too often but its a nice experience overall and I would definitely be down to try one of the sweet crepes in the future.
