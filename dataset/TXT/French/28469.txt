EEIz44ewHhOKmfTloAK13g Definitely one of the best restaurants I've have been to in Toronto.  My first impression of the room, crowd, and service, made me feel like I was in NYC or Chicago at a Michelin star restaurant.  We had the full wine pairing, tasting menu with optional cheese course. All dishes were great, and some were spectacular!
