While I would normally visit the location at yonge and bloor, I found myself at this location and fancied something light to pass the time.  The juliana seemed to fit that requirement today.  Raspberry jam and dark chocolate rolled together in a thin crepe certainly supported a welcome moment of nostalgia.   Paired with a warm bottle of limonana and cinnamon, I found myself watching out the window as pedestrians strolled by, contemplating the extent to which crepes a gogo manages to maintain such extreme consistency.  The staff were pleasant and the warm interior exhibited a coziness without feeling cramped.
