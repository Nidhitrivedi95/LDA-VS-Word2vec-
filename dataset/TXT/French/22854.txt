bzbNGyrTwWHAgg1CqkSgeg Terrace cafe has been one of my favorite brunch spots in Charlotte, but this week, I had the pleasure of sampling some of Terrace's new dinner menu, and thank God....grits are included!! I've always loved the grits here; they aren't to soupy, not too grainy and they are now a part of a shrimp and grits dinner menu item. I also had an interesting salad that included two colors of beets and a very delicious dressing. To top it all off , I enjoyed a gluten free peanut butter cheesecake that was so good I lost track of time eating it, zoned out a little.
