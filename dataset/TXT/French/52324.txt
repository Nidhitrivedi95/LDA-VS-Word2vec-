pwnz4O5LFxv2OBEy0UCjtw Had not been to Sophie since they had opened but I did remember the St. Viateur Montreal bagels they had.  You can get it with smoked salmon too (I need to go back to explore whether they walk down the street to get it from Kristapson's).  I enjoyed the tourtiere as well - great seasoning and the pastry was flaky but not too buttery.  

Cookies are kind of bland tasting like a shortbread - maybe good with coffee tho.  I think I'd try some of their other baked goods if I had a sugar tooth.  

Overall, I'm glad this place does not have bacon and eggs like every other brunch spot on the strip.  Small-ish menu, reasonable prices and bright corner location - good for a coffee and a lunch.  If you want a greasy breakfast boot-up head to the Tulip or similar.
