hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA Olivier is a gem. Made my day better. French men are nice after all. He praised me for my acai bowl choice and I threw in a croissant because well, how can you not get a croissant at a french place? Illy coffee w almond milk. Took a bite of a curry chicken sandwich which was bomb.
