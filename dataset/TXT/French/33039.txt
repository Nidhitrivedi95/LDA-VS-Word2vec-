H9pG0BNhqID2MTj8KnY3jQ First time here, glad to see a really great restaurant open up in Bloorcourt! The food was fantastic; incredibly quick and attentive service. Highly recommend the Karaage chicken and Gyu Don with rice. Portion sizes seemed perfect, and the ingredients were very fresh and flavourful.

Will definitely be going back soon!
