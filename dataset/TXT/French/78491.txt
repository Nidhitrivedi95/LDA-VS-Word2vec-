The wine list is small but well chosen. Service was business-like, efficient when we had an unexpected extra person arrive. The decor is simple and seating could be more comfortable. But we could hear each other in normal conversation, no ambient noise/music interference. For a weeknight meal, this was a very pleasant surprise for the group. Personally, it was an indulgence to have the foie gras and the beef tartare, both delicious and in portions large enough to share.
