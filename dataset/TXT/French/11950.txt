4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw One of the best French bistros in America! And it's in Vegas?!!  The ambiance of this place brings me back to Paris. Which is appropriate, considering it's located at the Paris Hotel & Casino :-). We had brunch here on a Sunday afternoon, so it was obviously very busy. Our waitress was super friendly and attentive despite the fact that she had multiple tables to serve. We started with adult beverages and the onion soup. C'est magnifique! The soup was warm and savory with very robust flavors. Lots of gruyere cheese and baguette slices to accompany. The beer selection is rather European as well. I opted for a Blanche du Bruxelles, a Belgian white brewski with hints of spices & citrus, while my boyfriend had a Kronenbourg, which I have always referred to as the French Miller Lite due to its light lager flavor. For our entrée, we split the seafood crepes.....scallops, shrimp, peas and cream.....to die for! On your next trip to Vegas, this place is a must stop!
