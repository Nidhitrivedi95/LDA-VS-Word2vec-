w1BbvLeKBSKBnlALLhPmGg Stayed at Malmaison Edinburgh for one night and enjoyed it.


 On arrival I was impressed by the building, view and decor and the reception staff were very nice, although I was not impressed that they take a charge on your credit card for the room rate and then £50 ontop for any spends you make. I think this is unfair that they take the money in advance, surely they could just do like other hotels and take yur details incase you do a runner!


 We were booked into a standard room, it was large and nicely decorated but not as impressive as I thought it might be. The bathroom was nice.


 We were on the 4th floor and the lift was broken for our whole stay - I would think they need to sort out a service agreement with a lift repair company! Still worked off a few calories!


 Food in the brasserie was delish, very enhoyable and the Homegrown menu was excellent value.


 Would stay again if I could get a good deal.
