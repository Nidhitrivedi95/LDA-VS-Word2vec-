XKPosZx2j4RHcZ8Ewdwj0A A great spot for a luxurious lunch.  The room is beautiful and our waitress was amazing.  They have a good price on a lovely two course lunch prix fixe.  I had Brussels with Lardon and goat cheese to start - a gorgeous grilled veal as my main - the side of kale was one of the loveliest kale I've ever eaten.  For dessert we were expertly steered to the pain perdu which has ruined me for any other French toast ever - get it!!!
