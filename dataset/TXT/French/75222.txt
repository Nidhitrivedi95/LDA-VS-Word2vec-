y0cgy0tTh_C8NWCk0WGgjQ Good neighborhood restaurant.  Good service.  Food is consistently good: I especially love the Rack of Lamb and the Poutine (for the Americans, a poutine is a dish of fries topped with cheese curds, bacon and gravy - yum!).  The ambience is casual, loud and comfortable.  No reservations taken and the wait could get stupid.  Nice patio for the summer.
