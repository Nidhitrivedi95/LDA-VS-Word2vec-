JsAjP49bCk9KjJmmmjyM4w Simply the best croissant place in Toronto!

A very small and cozy bakery located on the far west side of Queen street that always sell out of its yummy croissants before closing. 

The size of the croissant is daintier than most of the "American-size" ones we see out there, but one is enough to satiate your cravings.  I usually go for the classic croissant but last time I ventured their fig croissant and feta and cheese croissant - equally as good.  

Their shrimp and avocado croissant sandwich cannot be missed either. All in all folks, hands down for Claufoti *woot woot*.   

I suggest you try their latte as well, as it is served interestingly in a small bowl instead of a cup and full of flavor. 

Let me know if you share the same appreciation once you try this place out.

Cheerios!
