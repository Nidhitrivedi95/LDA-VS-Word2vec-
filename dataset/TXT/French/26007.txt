d482l58ho0_IMdFkXX1F5Q We had dinner on Nov.11, 2014. Everything was excellent from the time we sat down until the time we left the restaurant. The service was very well orchestrated. 

The food and the service was excellent! My wife had the special, tagliatelle white truffle pasta. I ordered the Coq au Vin. We started with the Tarte flambee and Escargot spatzle. Everything was delicious! 

I would highly recommend this restaurant. I will be back next time.
