mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q I dined at L'Atelier on Wednesday 11/26/14. My wife her parents and I walked over after enjoying Ka at the nearby theater. 
As a preface,I must say that I firmly believe that no matter how famous or accomplished a business/chef is, continued success must be based on customer satisfaction.
Unfortunately for my party, star french chef Hubert Keller was also dining at the restaurant with a small group that very same night.
The food and generally warm service was completely ruined by the pace of the meal and the excruciating wait between courses.
The restaurant was not particularly busy BTW. Mr. Moss, the Sommelier and manager, noticed the wait right after our first course and apologized. To make a long story short, we waited for so long in between courses that Mr. Moss comped us a bottle of champagne at the end of the night. He was extremely kind and professional. However, sadly, our night was ruined nonetheless.
Allow me to paint a picture, it was near 11pm and the restaurant was mostly empty, we have been waiting for dessert for 20 minutes and we see a procession of chefs come from the kitchen with all manner of dishes to please Mr. Keller while we just sat there. Disappointing and insulting.
Finally, we just got the check as we simply could not wait anymore. Our dessert arrived after the check. Additionally, I mentioned that I just just gotten married and we were celebrating this occasion. Not one mention of this was made by any of the service staff.ugh.
To sum it up, unfortunately, our experience was a huge let down. I have never wanted a tasting menu at a Michelin starred restaurant to end as soon as possible before. Not sure if the front of house let the kitchen down or vice-versa, but whatever happened, it was a real shame.
