SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA I finally had the pleasure of dining at L'Albatros last weekend, and it lived up to expectations. Everything was wonderful. My bf had the onion soup - it contained beef, which he said heightened the already delicious onion flavor. I ordered the foie gras which was also delicious, and to my surprise they gave me a huge portion of it - don't order it unless you plan to share! 

After our appetizers we sampled 5 cheeses from the cheese board. I wouldn't miss this experience. They have about 20 cheeses on the board, and all the servers are knowledgeable about the background of each cheese. It was really fun (and tasty!)

For entrees I had the duck confit, and omg - best duck I've had in my life. We were both speechless after trying it. The accompanying butternut squash puree and braised cabbage were amazing as well. My bf had the leg of lamb which was also wonderfully and uniquely flavored.

We had a bottle of bordeaux with our meal which was very good. While the food prices were very reasonable, the wine list was a tad pricey.

Unfortunately at this point we didn't have room for dessert - next time! I'll most definitely be back!
