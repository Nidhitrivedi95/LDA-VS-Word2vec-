YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g Knew Chef Keller from his many TV appearances and his french pedigree.  Was very excited.  Too bad the service was akin to a bad Denny's waitstaff.

We were cut off by the server before finishing our ordering.  Hence, Fleur lost out on a 28 dollar order for Diver Scallops.  I asked for the Duck but with the cabbage from the chicken entree.  We were served our Cesare salad and before we were even half through, our server asked if it would be ok if they brought the entree out since it was "ready".  We relunctantly agreed, only to be served the wrong order (they brought the chicken with the cabbage instead of the duck).  Off went both entrees to be remade.  While waiting, I asked the server to please place an order for the souffle so it would be ready when we finished our meal.

The dinners were good, though my duck skin was not as crispy as I'd hoped.  Server cleared our plates, asked if we wanted anything else, and proceeded to bring our check.  We were too aggravated to tell him he had forgotten about our souffle.  Another 15 dollars they threw away to bad service.

What a disappointment.  Won't go back again.
