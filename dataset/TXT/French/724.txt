_cjPEH9wXhKS-HQe_U3M4Q Located on a quiet part of Wellington by Spadina, Le Select is a Parisien style French Bistro with an authentic atmosphere and comprehensive menu. 

We came here on a Friday night to a pretty full house. The restaurant gets quite loud with all the chatter. The kitchen is in the basement whete they also have a really cool wine cellar that you should check out (along the way to the washroom). 

Across the group we ordered duck confit, venison, steak and frities, beef tar tar and the French onion soup. Highlights would be the duck confit which was crispy and flavourful with the sauce. The venison wasn't too dry and tasted good. The steak was a bit small to be filling. The French onion soup was good but not worth the cost.

Service was slow, including our wait for the food. However our waitress was kind and made recommendations for food before we ordered.

Pricing is on the higher end. I'd recommend trying this but I'l likely try to visit some other French bistros in Toronto before coming back.
