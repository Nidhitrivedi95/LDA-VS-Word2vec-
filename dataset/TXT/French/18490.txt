A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g There are two things I love dearly: french pastries (actually, most sugary confections will suit me just fine) and knocking out multiple Yelp bookmarks in a single day. Well Patisserie Manon, you managed to combine both of these into one easy pitstop.

For my first day back in town, my brother and I stopped by after a dinner nearby. Considering I had been obsessing over macarons for the past six months, it was evident we must get as many as possible to justify our journey across town. We picked up Ginger, Raspberry, Peanut Butter and Blueberry at a dollar apiece. Also, my brother had heard about the Tropezienne cake from a few of his Yelp friends, so that was clearly a necessity. 

The macarons. Oh god, I thought I found perfection in Seattle...but I was wrong. So wrong. These are the epitome of what a macaron should be - airlike but with crunch; chewy yet fluffy. These blew the ones I picked up in Seattle out of the water - the Ginger flavor being the clear standout.

As for the Tropizienne, I had never heard about it before. But after one bite, I sure as hell know what it is now. Layers of brioche soaked in a simple syrup with butter cream and peaches in between - seriously, how could you not love it? This mentality was clearly adopted between David S. and myself as we barehandedly devoured half of it in the parking lot - quite a barbaric sight if I'd ever seen one. The best part? A large (think the size of your head) piece was only $4.35. Thank goodness for the sizable distance between my house and Patisserie Manon - otherwise, my waistline might just hate my guts.
