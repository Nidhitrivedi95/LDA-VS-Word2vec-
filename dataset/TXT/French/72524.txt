XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q This was the most expensive meal I've ever had in my life.  Having said that, it was good, but not the life-altering experience I expected and frankly, felt I deserved when I got the bill.  It's not worth doing a blow-by-blow recap since the menu probably changes seasonally.  You get a choice of four prix fixe options and they'll work with you to do substitutions if, for example, you don't want the soup, but would rather finish up with the cheese trolley.  

Some highlights: the bread trolley was amazing with over a dozen varieties.  Service was nearly perfect.  Fairly small, contemporary and elegant dining room that is a surprising oasis of calm just outside the cacophony of the MGM casino.  Wine selection was good and while overpriced, at least not insultingly so.  Our courses ranged from ok, to amazing.  And I guess that's what I'm objecting to: at this price level, ok is not acceptable.
