YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g Maybe the best frites I've had, even better than the ones in Belgium. Absolutely to die for. The sliders were awesome. The oysters were good, but had chunks of shell in them which very much disrupted the dish.. Maybe it's just me, but having to reach in your mouth to pull out chunks of shell in a nice restaurant seems awkward at best.

Other than that, it was very good though.. And the "Liquid Nitrogen Frozen Cocktails" are worth trying once just for the floor show, but the cocktail was excellent too.
