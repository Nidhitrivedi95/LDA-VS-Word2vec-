P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ My review would be the same as any other 5 star review for the place so I'm not going to go into details about how great and attentive the service is, the beautiful ambience, etc.  The food here can best be described as an experience, and the taste- sublime.  The dishes here make you think about what you are eating- the presentation, the taste, the texture, the unexpected.  Yes, the bill will be high but you will be thinking about the food for days.
