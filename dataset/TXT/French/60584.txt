SCklYa_jhihWAcfIn-_chg Best croissants in town. Huge pieces of quiche, big bowls of brunch-y-ness. I started with a baguette and butter and jam. Then, I had a gorgeous fig and blue cheese tart. The tarts and quiches change with what is available.  Ingredients are top notch!  I agree with other posters. Do not come with your five best friends. All the couples will get seats before you and you'll just stress out over when that other table of 5 is leaving.  Get take out and go to the local parks or shops along this cute block of Queen E. 
Coffee is the only thing that does not stand out as something to remember.
