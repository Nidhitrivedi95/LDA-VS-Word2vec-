LjOBNcNNpuewBqSPxYYTJQ I'm disappointed with this location and after reading the other reviews I can see I'm not the only one. The quality of the pastries just isn't like what you find at the NoDa location but they're still good. 

My main concern is the staff. They are disinterested to the point of rudeness. I'm not the sort to expect servers to fall all over themselves at my expense so when I say they're bad, they are definitely bad. Please Amelie's, hire people who don't treat your customers like an inconvenience. I know you know this is a problem, I've seen your responses to other reviews.
