rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A After 4 days of living on cigarrettes, booze and cheeseburgers, coming to Bouchon and ordering everything they had on the menu for brunch was spectacular. Do not hold back, sit on the patio, order bottled water, YES get whatever the pastry of the day is and YES get the american breakfast with a cone of fries, the world's best eggs and a pound of bacon. Oh, and don't forget to eat the entire order of fresh bread they give you. After all, you just spent a day drinking an entire bottle of Vodka and discussing Internet marketing while smoking a pack of cigs in your 800 dollar hotel room. So, clearly, don't you deserve a treat!?
