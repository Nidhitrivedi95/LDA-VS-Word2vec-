C3PVq7UpeHd6nz1_e-AtkA The ambience is very warm with lots of wood and exposed brick, and dim lighting.  Music was mostly indie rock (Arcade Fire, Feist), not too loud but loud enough to hear it.  Our server for the evening was excellent, very friendly and helpful.   They don't take reservations, which wasn't a problem on a Sunday.  

We ordered a bunch of items to share and everything was tasty, although perhaps not mind-blowing.  The wine list is short, but contains a good range of choices to suit all preferences, and my dining companion indulged in some of the fancy cocktails they do, and said they were lovely.  

Overall a great dining experience, and I will definitely be back.
