5fquJHY2hMX9tPRD5s0t5g I've eaten here twice for birthday dinners and I must say the service and the food is very good! Each time we've had the big table by the escalator and it was so nice having that area to ourselves. The staff is very nice and the beef ribs are delicious!! I will definitely go back.
