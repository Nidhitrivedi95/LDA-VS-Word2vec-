rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A First experience at a Thomas Keller restaurant, and it did not disappoint.

The smoked foie gras terrine was spectacular!  Rich and decadent yet still totally balanced in both proportion, presentation and flavors.  No kidding, the foie with it's garnishes of citrus poached olives and sweet onion vinaigrette made for just about the single most delicious bite of food I've ever enjoyed.  My wife had the lamb, which was incredible and perfectly cooked, and I had the scallops, which were divine in their own right.

The (oh-so-very-minor) downsides that prevented a full five stars: Service seemed somewhat rushed, which I attribute to our early seating time (i.e. Trying to turn our table before the proper dinner rush hit), and also a bit disjointed.  We could have done with a couple more minutes between the foie appie and our entrees, and the mains were brought out before our table was cleared and re-set, so I had my main course but no silverware with which I could eat it.  Also, since the mains were rushed out we didn't get to fully enjoy our first wine selection before the next glasses were at our table.

Again, very small dings on the report card, IMO.

All said and done, Bouchon gave us a dinner to remember.  I'm looking forward to eating at my 'hometown' outpost in Beverly Hills!
