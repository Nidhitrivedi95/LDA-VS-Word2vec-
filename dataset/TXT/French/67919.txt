For those who relate to food as savory and gourmand experience, DON'T GO THERE. The crepes were just bland and uninteresting compilation of ok-fine ingredients, you can mix those at home yourself  at a quarter of the price, without need to knowing much about French cuisine. 
For college kids it could be a step up from fast and rush pizza and fast-food places, but that's about it.

Teas were good - at least something French and tasty!
