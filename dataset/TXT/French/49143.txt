oPGUbqBpHNZvVu9gAFJbMQ Wonderful experience, wonderful meal - mostly.  Our entire family went for my birthday.  At first glance it appeared to be a simple bistro, but the food was amazing.  Two of us had the Seafood Shell Au Gratin, one of the best dishes I've ever eaten.  My son declared the lamb was the best he's ever had; my husband enjoyed the Walleye, and my daughter the Mussels Frites.  Our server was pleasant and accommodating (with custom drinks).  Only odd thing was I watched him make a drink at the bar, taste it with a bar straw, then put the straw back in the drink and serve it to my daughter.  Didn't want to say anything, but that was gross and lost them a star.
