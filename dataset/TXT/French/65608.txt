u2OWmQOVGFBF_jVwuiIveA Went with my boyfriend and ordered two escaroles to start, I ordered the Fillet mignon and he ordered the veal medallions. 
I told the server I have an allergy to onions and can not have it on anything with onions. 
After waiting 50 Minutes our escaroles came. Mine was covered in onions. Another 10 minutes later a new one arrived with no onions, by this point i was starving, I tried to eat it and burnt my mouth so i kept stiring it untill i found a long curly body HAIR! The Main cources came and my $32 Fillet Mignon that was supposed to be medium rare was well done and solid like a hockey puck with no sign of red.

This has to be one of the worst restaurant experiances I have ever had, We could'nt believe everything took so long and could be that bad, when we got there there was one other couple in the restaurant which left before we even got our food. 

We also noticed they were filling up pints of beer and bringing them to the kitchen. DRINKING ON THE JOB!

After all that. The still proceeded to charge us full price for everything.
