uP3H5bcsiTXM0k0xQhRndg On my first visit to Montreal, I went to Le Robin Square, mostly based on their #1 rating on Yelp.  My family of five order the Mac and cheese, the ultimate experience, calamari and the steak.  The calamari and the steak were ok. The Mac and cheese was absolutely delicious.  It's served with a homemade hot sauce on the side that had a nice habanero kick. My kids could not stop eating the Mac. The ultimate experience was out of this world. It was the best dish I've ever eaten, period. The pork belly just melts in your mouth. It's served on three delectable purees and sautéed mushrooms. If you ever get a chance to dine here do not leave until you've tried the ultimate experience!
