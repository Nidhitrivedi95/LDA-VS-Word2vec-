aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw What a way to lure you in. EVIL!!! We were walking pass the Venetian heading to Palazzo for dinner and BOOM in big bold letters "Bouchon Bakery". GRRRR, what a way to ruin all the calories I just lost running 13+ miles.

We walked in and didn't find as many goodies as I had hoped (which is a good thing). Totally opposite from the Bouchon Bakery in Napa, where there is a ginormous amount of goodies to choose from. 

I looked around and didn't feel like macaroons and yes they were BIG. I was eyeballing some cookies and didn't see any chocolate chip ones. I asked the gentleman behind the counter and he mentioned that the ones displayed were chocolate chip cookies. YAY! I ordered one to go and we were off. $3 a pop.

MC is happy...
