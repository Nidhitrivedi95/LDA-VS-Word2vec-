SBnpT6JDbah-5l_52GM5sw Beautiful and delicious dinner tonight! Wonderful atmosphere, came with my college daughter. We both loved it. Started with the seared ahi tuna appetizer with avocado - so so so good. I had the mussels with frites/mayo which were ridiculously addictive. The mussels were fantastic. Followed by the duck confit salad - INCREDIBLE! and the chicken breast stuffed with goat cheese. I am frequently wary of chicken (esp breast) in restaurants because it's often so dry but this was bone-in, juicy, tender. It was served on a bed of corn, fava beans and BACON. I could have eaten a bucket of that stuff. SO GOOD. We both wanted dessert but were way too full. Maybe next time...
