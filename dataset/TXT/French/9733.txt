4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Walked in and waited 10mins to sit inside with a couple of friends for dinner.

Food:
1. Escargo - The escargo was tender but lacked flavor.  lots of butter used.
2. Mussels - Mussels were not fresh fresh but the white wine with herb sauce was flavorful.
3. Seared Salmon - The sear was beautiful but the sauce needs work.  It lacked flavor and was to soupy.  I think the salmon would have been better without the sauce.
4. Roasted Chicken - crispy herb skin and very moist inside.
5. Hanger steak - cooked medium rare with merlot butter.  The butter was fantastic.

Overall, I would come back to try there other dishes.
