jA3xcba82t8x06H8NzG4VQ Second time here and still impressed! Oh my oh my ... the Pork rinds are out of this world! They crunch and pop when you take a bite. Little bit of a wait time, a couple large parties ahead us. Burger was cooked to perfection, may be one of the best burgers in Cleveland! The fries today were a tad bit over done or old... not sure which one.. my guess old because we are eating at 9:30 at night ... either way, Highly recommend making this place one of your next stops!
