Came with a friend one evening, and we had the charcuterie board, rabbit leg, tuna loin, and cheese plate. Charcuterie board was excellent, especially the duck (liver?) mousse, which we shared with jealous restraint. The mains were good, and the homemade chips that came with the rabbit particularly surprised me. They also know their cheeses, and we both enjoyed the cheese plate very much. Prices aren't cheap, but are reasonable ($20-25/MP for entrees).

Service is helpful, decor is woody and a little bit rustic. Alcohol is surprisingly not that expensive; a (small) glass of port is only $6.

Food vs price: 3.75/5
Service and ambience: 4.5/5
