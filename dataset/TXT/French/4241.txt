Pre publicity it seemed like a great place to know to eat, a wonderful bistro with all the trim - indulge in anything, enjoy a cigarette between courses and lose your concerns in a great meal.  Indulge in everything but self consciousness.
The food is very good - reliable and delicious over years. 
Authenticity may wane with acclaim here...
