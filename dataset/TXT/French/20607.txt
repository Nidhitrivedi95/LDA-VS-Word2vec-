AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw Food here is amazing. Ordered the croque madam and it was just perfect. Perfect eggs, perfect toast. The side of salad that is came with was a little lackluster, but that's ok, needed something healthy to balance out the meal. Latte is strong and delicious. My friend got the eggs benedict, which looked amazing too and it comes on a croissant. The croissant just melts in your mouth. Food is great here. They also have fresh squeezed orange juice. Place does get busy, so get here early for a table.
