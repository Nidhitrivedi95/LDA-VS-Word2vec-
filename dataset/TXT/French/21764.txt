Before enjoying dinner, I ordered a strawberry mojito which was absolutely amazing! It tickled my taste buds! It wasn't too strong but just fruity and alcoholic enough! After my delicious mojito, I had the Homestead Surf and Turf which is a half brisket half crab sandwich and I got horseradish sauce for dipping. The brisket and crab were to die for and the horseradish sauce was absolutely fantastic! Honestly, I could not ask for a better experience here! I'd recommend this hole in the wall joint to anyone!
