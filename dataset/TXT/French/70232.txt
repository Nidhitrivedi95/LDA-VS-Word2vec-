X17gJz1zuPQescVK1lnQLA Their billiards soccer gimmick was not worth the cost of $70 an hour. They make you pay a deposit which doesn't get refunded until the following Monday. But they'll make you pay the hourly rate the day of. Also how does a place run out of food on a Saturday night!?!?!?!? No onions for their burgers or onion rings, no guacamole, no tempura; no Montreal smoked meat, no cheese curds for their poutines, no ketchup. KETCHUP!!! How does an establishment run out of so many things on a Saturday. Go to 24 hour Sobeys and restock if you run out! We weren't even told half our orders were affected on the shortage until 30min after we ordered. On top of that they tried to charge my group double on our bills. It eventually became comical with the horrible management and service.
