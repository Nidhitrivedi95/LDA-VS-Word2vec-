mRrgBIT8vsYdI3YSfzCQhg Very enjoyable food. Smaller portion sizes but all the flavours and textures were on point. Prices were reasonable for a more upscale dining experience. Small and intimate setting. Very noisy when full. Family run restaurant. Service was alright, except it took forever for our bills to come. However, would not come back as nothing stood out as anything needing to be experienced again.
