QlSpPzc4Oy05ic-PsoYH4g After speaking outside with the Owner/Chef, Matt, on Friday night while waiting to enter Club Cafe, we decided to return for dinner the following night. We ate a delicious Tapioca dish (not the pudding) that contained confit duck along with other delicious things and a Seitan Cheesesteake with hand-cut fries. Matt gave us vegetarian Arancini and these were delicious also. We went there because of the sincerity and passion of Matt and also the Yelp reviews. It was a delicious experience at the end of Carson Street, where the good stuff lives. We will return soon. A really good neighborhood place for adults on the South Side!
