rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw Ok, so I have had brunch here twice. Food was good. Service good but not friendly. I do have to complain about the bartenders. Both times went to get a drink first and the bar staff was so stuffy. This last Saturday night was the worst. The older gentleman who was at the bar around 6pm was just flat out rude. We ask to see the happy hour menu and he was reluctant to give it to us. We asked how is night was so far to try and warm him up but nothing. I know happy hour patrons may not be your favorite but they are still patrons. With everyone's stuffy attitudes we won't be back.m
