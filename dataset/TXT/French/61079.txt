SFnrHuVFSNiondFVUBLJZQ Ah Old Montreal.. the European charm, the cobble stone street, the tourist traps... Yeah, this place has decent food for higher than average prices, but it makes up for it with comfortable outdoor seating, or multiple levels inside with nice cool AC for those muggy Montreal summers. 

Ordered a bottle of San Pellegrino with lemon for the glasses and we enjoyed a lunch of savory crepes - specifically the spinach, ham and brie filled one and a brie with caramelized onion sandwich. The sandwich came with a nice little side salad. Everything was tasty. Service was friendly, but leisurely which is fine when you are vacation. 

I wouldn't recommend this place as a destination, but if you are in the area looking to people watch with your meal this place fits the bill nicely directly on Rue Saint-Paul Est.
