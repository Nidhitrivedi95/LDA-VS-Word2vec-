qmh6zxtJ8C8-YiUPv7ySlw I'm really biased when I want to put the owner in my pocket and carry him around.  Daniel Boulud is just that cute.  Anyway, I really enjoyed my meal here.  There were four of us, and we had an early reservation that had us seated without a problem with a view of the pond outside.  All of us did the prix fixe for $48.  I had the pate, which was whimsically plated and very good.  I and another at my table had the salmon which  paired salty capers with sweet raisins (I think).  I love fish, so there's not a whole lot you could do to fish and disappoint me.   I don't really get excited about dessert, and I honestly can't remember what I got.   The atmosphere made me feel like I wasn't even in Vegas, and beyond the wedding with Elvis in tow, it was quiet and relaxing.
