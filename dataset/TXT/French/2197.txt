0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g I loved that if you tell them you have a show to get to, the server will cater to you and "rush" your food.  By "rush" I mean you are given a disclosure that they will speed up the food delivery so you can make the show on time!  And that we did...finished up our dinner with 5 minutes to get to "O" across the hotel...wonderful.  

The wine pairing is an amazing deal!!!! GET IT!
