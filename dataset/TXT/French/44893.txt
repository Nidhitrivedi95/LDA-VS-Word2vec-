mRrgBIT8vsYdI3YSfzCQhg Went with friends tonight for winterlicous. That on a Monday night a restaurant can be so full is a testament to the quality not only of the food, but also of the service. The menu was excellent and the wait staff attentive and personable. We all had a hard time choosing what to eat it all looked so enticing. I chose the tourtière with braised red cabbage and a chicken spring roll starter. The rolls were hot, fresh out of the deep fryer, but not a drip of oil on them. Tasty. The main was so delicious. Comfort food for winter. The portion was so generous I couldn't finish it. 
For dessert again the choices were difficult. I had the banana muffin with chocolate cream cheese icing. De-lish-ous! We lingered a long time after our meal was finished and the wait staff continued to fill our water glasses and ask if we wanted a top up of our coffees. 
Our friends now have a new place on their list to go for dinner. I love sharing great places to eat. The only downside for me is will I be able to get a reservation next time?
