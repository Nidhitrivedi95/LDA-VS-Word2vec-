Kut9tVbDX_f7qKMRRoXg3w I would have given 4 stars, overall this place is good, the only thing is the food was slightly bland and with a bit of salt and pepper it was perfect! Same can be said about the cappuccino and macchiato, just a bit better quality coffee and hot chocolate mix it would have been spot on. Atmosphere service was great! Also need to replace the shakers with ground pepper and rock salt!
