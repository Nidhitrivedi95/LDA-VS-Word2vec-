start off by saying this is on Cumberland West of Bay and is on the north side. it's on the second floor of a tight building space and if you blink you'll miss it. have to take the stairs.

right away greeted with a wait staff that speaks French and English and a cost check. Very warm vibe with a slightly older demographic that visits but not to worry.

They have daily specials of which had the Venison Sirloin, French Onion Soup and Lemon tart. Have to say, in an area where they are competing with multiple French fine dining restaurants, this place holds it own and offers a pleasant experience.

food was very rich and true to the cuisine and atmosphere was very welcoming. the wine list was actually pretty food value and paired well. was happy to come here during a weeknight dinner for a small celebration with a work colleague and impressed that it does its best to live up to the experience the area is known for in French cuisine.

giving it a 3.5 rounded up to 4.0.
