9ot8oInkYZTt6wkkGe__vQ Service is amazing, and the ambience is great. They have an inside-patio at the back of the resto and you can eat there rain or shine.

Location is pretty bad; it's in the middle of nowhere. After you eat, you have to get on a car or go on the subway to go somewhere else for fun, because there's nothing around there. But if the food and service and ambience are great, this isn't a deal-breaker. 

The food was reallllly fresh!!! 

But I gotta say, the flavours weren't all that amazing......The salad appetizer was very fresh, but it was literally cut veggies, with barely any dressing. I usually don't like a lot of dressing on my salad, but there was barely any on that salad. I guess they wanted me to enjoy the bare freshness of the veg? 
My main was bitter (they charred the meat, which is nice; I don't mind a little bitterness from the char), BUT they coupled it with a bitter salad. Too much bitterness in one main...I don't know how those chefs thought that was a good idea. 
Dessert was good; I don't know if they make their own, but I got a torte and it was really good.

I know some people absolutely adore this place, and I can understand why; great service and amazing ambience and decor, and I'm sure they like the food the way it is. 
But personally for me, the food just wasn't that amazing. 

For the prices they charge, the food should be really really good. I want to give 3.5 stars.
