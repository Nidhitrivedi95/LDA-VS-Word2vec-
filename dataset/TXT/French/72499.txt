XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q Amazing from Start to finish.  I just went for it. I order the 17 Course tasting menu.  One of the best meals that I have ever had.  I could describe it all to you - but you can see it all online.  The staff, was gracious, kind, perfection.  Impeccable service.  First, every plate was like a work of art, almost to nice to eat.  Secondly, Always know that there are many price points.. I am not certain, but I think I saw a 3 course tasting for about 125.00 with multiple options up to 250.00. I picked the full 17 course, which was something like 450.00 - throw in a glass of champagne to start.. And a fairly inexpensive descent bottle. Add a descent tip.. 795.00 for one person. Also keep in mind with the menu that I received - the entire Table must order it. It makes sense when you go, because it's all about perfection and timing.  So keep in mind that there are many price points, for me - worth every penny. Amazing.  If I am allowed I will upload my courses.. It's stunning. One last thing. It's mostly fish etc.. Which most French places are.. I don't eat fish, I don't like it.. And I mean none.. But I wanted the experience.. I just about ate every single serving. Amazing what quality can do. Enjoy.
