33Tr0eRki1Yamzleu4GMdw I have been here on two separate occasions and I can't believe I almost forgot to review this place.

Rosallie is a fantastic cafe that recently opened in the area. The pastries are amazing and so is the cute little shop. The owner and his family are so sweet, it's definitely a welcoming spot to enjoy treats.

The lemon tart, almond cake and almond croissant are a revelation. The quiche and teas that I've tried are excellent as well.

Having this in the area is amazing and I can't wait to make it a regular on my rotation.
