4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I wanted this to be a romantic night overlooking the Bellagio fountains before going to "O" cirque du soleil. My night was foiled by one misstep after another which added up to be a 3 star rating.

1. We had to wait 20 minutes after arriving despite coming 5 min early to our reservation.
2. We wanted to share a salad "endive and pear" which was delicious, but did not split or give a second plate until we asked.
3. I ordered the trout which was overcooked and impossible to cut with the dull butter knives.
4. It was overcrowded, extremely loud and not romantic at all.

Needless to say we did not get seated outdoors because there was a 2.5 hour wait.

The salad was tasty as was the mashed potatoes, but for $100 dollar check I should have received better service.
