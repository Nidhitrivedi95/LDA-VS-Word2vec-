pKiSzUlBBRNEdTML24piXA This place is small and cozy. I decided to arrange to have my best friend's birthday dinner here while I visited her from out of town. Since I had no idea about the restaurant scene in Phoenix, I resorted to Yelp to figure out where we should eat. I decided on Centurion because of their menu and the photos.

I also had been in contact with one of the people who worked there to arrange this dinner--he was very helpful and friendly

We ate outside on the patio since our party was 7 people (the inside is pretty small). They had a fire pit on since it was cold.

There were a couple of options for dinner service. Since the restaurant is pretty small, I believe they only had a limited number of ovens and said that if we decided to individually get stuff then it'd just come out in batches, and not all at once. Or, if we wanted they would just start rolling things out based on what they could cook the quickest. We picked the first option.  I got the chorizo risotto which tasted so yummy and creamy! I also had the duck pizza, which was surprisingly very good. A good size (about 12-14inches in diameter). My friends got the tilapia, they said it was bland.

We brought over a birthday cake and there was a cake cutting fee for about $5 a slice--which was pretty expensive (7 people x $5 = $35 to slice a $50 cake). I would forgo bringing a cake over and just wait til you get home or something to cut a cake for 7 people. One thing that disappointed me was when he told me there was a cake cutting fee, it was "around $3-5 a slice" .. Obviously, he kept the ambiguity of the price and decided to charge me the more expensive. If you decide to choose the cake cutting fee, ask for the actual price and not the approximate.

They split the check for us, took a little bit longer than expected. An automatic gratuity of %18 was added to the bill.

I'd try it out again, maybe the experience would be different with a smaller party of 2 or 3! :)
