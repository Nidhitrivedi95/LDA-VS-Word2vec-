mT8Ej8sKFJoIa5G0Vl4AKA Food was ok.  Maybe average to slightly above average depending on the item.  But the price seemed a little steep.  It could be that I'm still not totally used to the higher price of food in Montreal compared to the US, but still, it seemed a little too much for the quality.  I went there because someone else picked the restaurant, but I'd probably try to avoid this place in the future.
