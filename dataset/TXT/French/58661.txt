RmGjo_2kT5wDVoqJb_IDCg I was in the area to check out Lady Marmalade for Sunday brunch but there was a long line up and we were starving, so we checked out La Canard Mort.  There was only one other table with three people sitting at it, so I was slightly worried about what we would get, but we were drawn in by the different eggs benedict sold for $7.50 as a brunch special, as well as by the peach caramel french toast advertised outside.  

The food was delicious - the best brunch I've had in Toronto.  The hollandaise sauce was perfect, and my friend and I shared the mushroom eggs benny and the shrimp eggs benny, along with the french toast special.  We were both stuffed when we were done, but ate every last bite.  I noticed that mimosas and caesars were also available for $3/each.

There was one server working and she was very helpful and friendly.  I liked the decor and the open windows that allowed a breeze.  The bathrooms were also really cute with old recipes posted on the walls and little face clothes to dry your hands with.  

I'll definitely be back.
