jSfnItqaOnEp2nenVF7fCg This is for takeout only. My husband had a lunch meeting there so I asked him to pick me up the chicken salad. He ordered it when he was leaving. When he brought it home I was very disappointed to see it was pretty much a bag of lettuce with a few strips of chicken, a few onions, maybe a strip of undercooked bacon in a clump at the bottom, and a few slices of apple. The chicken was good. They put a roll in a separate box with some butter. It's 100+ degrees so of course it melted and soaked the bread making it mushy. It was disappointing...$14 for a 1/2 a chicken breast and a bag of lettuce. No thanks.
