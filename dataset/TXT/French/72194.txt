I told waiter I was in a rush so the wine came out after 25 min one by one! This was a first.
I ordered for my friend who was running late so we could get out on time...steak.  it still took 45-60 min to get both dishes even w med rare steak and "we are in a rush".
Food - My ravioli was utterly bland, uncooked, and underwhelming to say the least.
My friend said her steak was good.  Hmm...I hope so.

Shocking that this was our hotel s recommendation.  Never EVER again.
