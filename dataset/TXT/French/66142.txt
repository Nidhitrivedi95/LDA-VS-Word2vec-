I had the Mexican Eggs Benedict on gluten free toast (they must have run out of GF buns, as these are an option on the menu). I asked for them to substitute the chorizo for something vegetarian and they obliged. It's nice to go to a restaurant where the GF/veggie and meat options are plentiful so everyone can be happy. :)

I'll definitely be back to sample other offerings on the menu.
