1j9BbuiaVYQWyXyUjb3rHg I was invited to brunch at Maison Fou Brasserie, and I was surprised because I'd never even heard of it. (I feel like I'm at the point in my life now where I recognize most Toronto restaurants by name.)

Anyway, I decided to order the Eggs Gaspé ("crab cakes, poached eggs, bacon, beurre blanc, potatoes dauphinois"). It's fine but completely unmemorable. First of all, the food arrived lukewarm. The crab cakes had clearly been prepared long before I received the plate. Far more problematic, though, was the disappointing blandness of the dish. There weren't any bold flavors to be found here, and after just a few bites, I was craving something different in terms of tastes.

Fortunately, we decided to order a dessert and this is where the restaurant shined. I got the Orange Rosemary Crème Brûlée and it was pretty fantastic. It contained the signature caramelized top one expects and the delectably creamy pudding held within was irresistible and quite flavorful. The orange rosemary separates this dish from any other variation I've had before, and I would gladly eat it again.
