ME6D5nLlfG0xZCtICOYDuw I travel to Paris quite often and have had some yummy and not so yummy French food.
That being said I truly enjoyed this Brasserie.  I was out on a balmy sunny Friday and I turned into Piedmont Center parked my car and thought I'd check out the 3 restaurants an decided  on George's.  Can I say I left Happy French!!!! 
I will return to try everything on the menu eventually.
I gave it a 5 star, but the wait staff never asked if I wanted dessert before bringing the bill. Sometimes dessert is an added treat.
