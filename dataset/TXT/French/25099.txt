Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA This is my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas. We were there for my birthday and I could not believe the food, decor and service! Amazing!

Loved the jellyfish like glass orbs hanging down, the view of the strip and the menu!!

I had a fabulous filet, mac and cheese and asparagus that is TO DIE FOR!!!!

Can't say enough about it!
