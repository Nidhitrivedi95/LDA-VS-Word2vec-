nk9lP-iXi7xklwN3VYf6Ew I bought a cake here for a birthday. The cake tasted blah. It wasn't bad, but wasn't great. Definitely not worth the $40 I spent on it though.

The cake could have been a lot moister. Not sure if I will try another cake from here again, because the price was high and couldn't justify it when comparing it to the taste.

I rather prefer the cakes you can get at Decadent Desserts (where they sell Dufflet's, and some other top of the line cakes for $20-$30 each)
