EEIz44ewHhOKmfTloAK13g Alo exceeded my expectations for fine dining in Canada, but has some major things to work on to be world class.

First of all, I'm not a fan of the tables where you have half the group in a booth and half the people in chairs. Its not intimate and the table is too big. The overall look of the restaurant is appealing.  Picking your napkin color is cheesy but a nice touch.

Secondly, service was sterile and routine, not only the food descriptions but the boring tasting pairing as well. Our server was smarmy, not genuine and seemed put out. Frustrating.

Lastly, the length and pacing of the meal was horrendous. There were 6 dishes and 4 amuses.  The dinner was over 3 hours long. That's inexcusable.  15 minutes between courses left me bored and starving after dinner. For a restaurant open two years, no clue what Chef Kriss is doing, and he was there half the meal expediting.

Take away these things and its Michelin worthy.  The food for the most part is amazing. Chef does an amazing job with fish and balancing fresh citrusy flavors.  He also kills with the vegan tasting, which was a touch mushroom heavy but I thought was great and actually preferred to some of the regular courses. Chef also is amazing at adding texture to several dishes.  

Some highlights included the bead cheese starter, the toro tartare with coconut which was perfect,  and the scallop.  

The halibut was an utter joke, horrendous.  Dessert was sterile and boring need some work there.

I had a fun time. I wouldn't say this is a must visit, but its really solid.
