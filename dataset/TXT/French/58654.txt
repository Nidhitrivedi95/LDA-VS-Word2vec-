RmGjo_2kT5wDVoqJb_IDCg I always excited to try new restaurants..especially if they are non Asians cuisine as I have enough share of Chinese restaurant reviews!! 

Love the casual homey deco of Le Canard Mort. Even the kitchen is homey as it is quite small in size and have 2 chefs working. This maybe the reason why our orders took forever to come!! 

The beer and cocktail selections here is awesome and priced reasonably!! My 2 Yelp Drinking Buddies each got their favourite beers... oh love the little pink elephant on the Delirum Tremens mug! My Elderflower Splitz, highly recommended by our friendly waitress was refreshing, a great summer drink! 

Wait Wait Wait 

Crisp Sweetbread ($11) finally arrived 

Sweetbread looked and smell similar to buffalo chicken wings. (Before this meal, I am naive enough to think sweetbread is really sweet bread.... and I have to admit I have one of my numerous "dumb/embrassing" moment... blushing....) I found the hot sauce just a little overwhelming and the texture or the taste was just lost. It tasted like buffalo chicken wings 

Wait Wait Wait 

Lobster Cobb ($18) finally arrived 

Lobster was cooked and seasoned well with a hint of buttery goodness, it also have good texture and not rubbery at all. but sadly I found it did not go well with the saltiness of Pancetta  nor the richness of blue cheese 

We skipped dessert as I don't think I can Wait any longer..... and the food here is not worth the wait. 

I might come back to Le Canard Mort for a drink but I might just pass on the food. I can't imagine I dine here on a Friday or a Saturday night instead of a Tuesday!
