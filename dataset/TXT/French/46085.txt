MxHZ5XwIQWnJFTw9gZxAIg This is turning out to be a good start to the weekend - a wonderful lunch was had at the Maison Blueu. - As they have a promotion it was the best time to taste their cooking. - They offer 1998 prices until July 2013 - meaning you pay £7.50 for a Starter and a Main course.

We were cheerfully greeted and promptly seated on arrival. 
There is an upstairs too, but we were sitting on street level. 

The meal was fabulous! After the fresh crusty bread with vinegar and oil, I had the Eouf Cocotte with cream of blue cheese (Roquefort) and leek a fondue. Anita had the Haggis Balls.
For main I chose the Duck Confit (Shepherd's Pie stylee) and Anita had the Salmon Darne. 

My duck was cooked to perfection and was falling apart underneath the roughly mashed potatoes that had a little hint of cheese(?) lightly drizzled with a tangy Burgundy jus - very tasty and I savoured it. Anita was enjoying her salmon with gusto and she was finished even before I was halfway my duck. The licking the lips and nods indicated she really enjoyed it! - So I let her taste mine too. Which got another approving nod - Anita A say 'yes' to both dishes served up as main course. 

However - here is the niggly bit, the wine we wanted (Malbec) was not available.. so we had the Cotes du Rhone - at a whopping £6.25 a 125ml glass I was a little disappointed with that price - so. our 2 people dine for £15 was about doubled with the wine we took. 

How does that math work? - Anyhow - it was our choice to drink wine and we could have easily not taken it. But it is ruddy expensive!
So they lose a star on not having affordable nice glasses of wine
