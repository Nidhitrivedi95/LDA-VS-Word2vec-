SFnrHuVFSNiondFVUBLJZQ This lovely little French restaurant is located in the heart of Old Montreal. It was 3 minute walk from Notre-Dame-de-Bon-Secours Chapel, the oldest Church in Old Montreal. Since I was craving for crepes, my husband and I decided to try this restaurant after we visited that church. 

The restaurant was not fancy and the furniture was old-fashioned. Since we were Asians, the servers did not put a lot of attentions to us (we had an impression that the servers didn't like Asians since they just spend time talking to either locals or Caucasians.) We ordered a Crepe Suzette (crepe served with a delicious orange sauce, Grand Marnier and Cognac), a French onion soup and a mocha. We were surprised the portion was very big in terms of the money we spent. That was probably the best crepe we have ever tried. I am always afraid of food with strong orange scent (since it reminds me of the smell of garbage chute for some reason), but here, the crepe was just perfect, you can taste the hint of orange flavor but it won't be too over. The crepes are very crispy, thin and chewy. The French Onion soup was full of cheese and hearty. The mocha works perfectly with the crepes. 

Aside from the service we had here, everything else was perfect! We will definitely come back to visit Chez Suzette! :)
