eDtBCZDo92LqBCIfE45hhg Had an excellent experience at Accords when I visited Montreal this summer. Our concierge at the Marriott Chateau Champlain recommended this place saying it wasn't too expensive (after going all out at Au Pied de Cochon the previous evening, I was looking to give my credit card a break) and mentioned the wine pairings, and my lady and I were in. When I checked the menu beforehand I was surprised at her definition of "not too expensive," but I have no issues shelling out $ for good food. 

As a price measure we skipped apps and started with mains as wine pairings (as others have noted each dish is paired with an accord - classic wine combination, and a discord - a pairing that still works, but its a little funky, meant to get your taste buds working). I would recommend getting half glasses of both the accord and discord (I actually preferred my discord with my fish). The lady got the Surf & Turf, lobster, lobster stuffed pasta and seared sweetbreads (she liked the sweetbreads until I told her what they were [mistake!]). I got the Pomo Dore, seared pike w/ tomatoes, clams and mozzarella.  

Both dishes were beautifully presented and perfectly composed. The broth in my fish was superb, and the wine pairings really brought my food to a new level. I must admit, though I dine out quite often, I was never much for wine pairings, thinking concept a bit contrived. After Accords, I'm on board.

At the (excellent) recommendation of our waiter we shared the San Domingo Dingo, a chocolate and cherries dessert w/ black forest ice cream that was expertly paired (thanks again, mr. waiter) with a delicious dessert wine. All in all, a great experience. Fresh food, clean flavors, pretty plates and good service. Ambiance on the outside terrace was relaxing, romantic and not too pretentious. A great date night/white tablecloth place in Montreal to counter funkier spots like Garde Manager and Au Pied Cochon.
