YO0fC7aJv8PzZ1MGf_F6Vg There are very few times that you can honestly order your meat rare and not have to worry that it will be undercooked; this is one of the few restaurants that you can have faith in the chef. While the food is expensive, it is so finely prepared that you try to forget about the price and just enjoy the food.  Worth every penny. Each dish was expertly prepared and plated. The baguette on the table was incredibly fresh and crusty.  The service was very good and the atmosphere was nice. (Well, maybe the pews were a bit hard, but that's about all.)
