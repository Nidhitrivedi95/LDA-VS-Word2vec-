4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Really enjoyed it here, during lunch they seat people in one area and it was really condensed but I didn't mind I really relished in the view of the strip. Our waitress was super friendly and catered to our needs. The filet mignon was yummy but a bit dry for a medium well, but overall the experience was lovely. Will be coming back here for special occasions.
