33Tr0eRki1Yamzleu4GMdw The sign says Le French Cafe.  The Yelp listing says Rosallie & on the chalkboard inside it says Rosallie.  It feels barren inside as the decor at this place is very low budget & plain... There really is nothing here which feels warm, French & inviting. 

The girl who took our order was nice. The table was not clean & we had to wipe it off before sitting down. 

The coffee was not anything I would order again. My husband had the latte & it was tasteless & I had French Vanilla Latte & there was not any coffee taste, but there was some creamy vanilla.  Very little foam on top. There was a pretty heart type design. 

You order at the counter & they bring it to you. That's the service Level. No follow up, so it is much like a Fast Food place. Except the prices are more like a sit down restaurant. 

Lentil soup was bland & had no texture.  Would not recommend. It was served hot. 

Salad with quiche was tasty. Good dressing & they put on a nice quantity. 

Quiche Lorraine was hot & tasted pretty good. 

Quiche Chèvre (goat cheese) was smooth & bland. Not something I would order again. It was ok & came out hot. Crust was bland. I had to add salt to make it palatable.

I love French food & was looking forward to trying this restaurant.  Will try again if I hear that it has improved.
