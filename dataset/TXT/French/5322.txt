3FlWR_osNPb8dcqLgHebHw We had breakfast here this morning. We were seated quickly and service was fast.  I ordered the breakfast tacos, which were very tasty. My friend ordered the egg white omelette and he said it was also very good.  Server was very attentive and made us feel welcomed. We will return here again.
