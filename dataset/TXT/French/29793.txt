FJMMPL3pxAPYGEPB0Hwlhw We enjoyed the pre-theatre menu at Toca and had an outstanding experience. The food, ambience and service were excellent. 
I had the pasta and my husband had the trout - both were delicious. I did not love the lamb meatballs but the pasta was great! Our appetizer was a delicious butternut squash soup. Desserts were rich, decadent and delicious!
The service was outstanding! Our server was Leah and she was excellent! All of the staff in the restaurant were awesome.
And they are so conscientious about allergies! My husband has celiac and they were completely understanding and accommodating.
I would highly recommend Toca!
