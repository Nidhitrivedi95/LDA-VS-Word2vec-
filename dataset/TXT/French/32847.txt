You are closing your original doors downtown and moving your staff to the Monte Carlo and Palms property by end of year. I don't know if the other locations will be able to compete, but I will be visiting you before you close to enjoy your luxurious and well prepared tastes. Ross has been my waiter at Andre's on numerous occasions and always looks after his guests.  (He is the one who informed me they were closing when we ran into each other at Terra Verde)

Folks, make your reservations for this place in advanced, they setup a custom menu with your name on it that you can take home as a reminder of your fantastic meal and time spent there. 

I've taken a few people here, a true gem of Las Vegas off the strip with style and fantastic food, drinks and desserts.
