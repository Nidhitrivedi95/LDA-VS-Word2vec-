ovtlrcsVRlgZZQUlHs_ovw Dinner was excellent. Service was very attentive! 
Had the peach and arugula bruschetta as an appetizer, my friends liked it, me not so much but after that everything was delicious. 

Caprese salad with heirloom tomatoes and salmon was delicious. The tomatoes were peeled and tasted fresh, basil was also very fragrant and delicious. The salmon was cooked perfectly moist and the whole salad was served with a balsamic vinaigrette that complemented it perfectly. The chocolate cake was really rich but perfect for sharing since 2-3 bites is probably enough for anyone. 

Wine and beer selection is pretty extensive and the server seemed very knowledgeable as to what was a good wine pairing. 

Service was absolutely outstanding. 

Will definitely come again.
