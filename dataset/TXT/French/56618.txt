rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A The Bouchon has been my go to restaurant each time we visit Las Vegas as the food has always been a treat. However our recent dining experience left much to be desired. First course Oysters...very expensive for 6 and two of them were the size of a dime and mushy, the other four were slightly larger, but very, very small, seemed old. The soup of the day, white bean was awful, raw vegetables with chicken stock poured over them and maybe five beans in the soup. Foie Gras, came out scorched black on both sides and tasted burnt...the waiter could not be located by bus help. Main entree sea bass, usually a thicker filet, this was very thin and dry and they had sprinkled sea salt all over the top after cooking and placed it on top of more very undercooked tasteless vegetables. The sausage and mashed potatoes, tasted good, but were very cold, must have been sitting a long time before being served....just a sad experience and my last trip to the Bouchon.
