YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g We went on a Wednesday night, and it was fairly empty.  Dishes were delicious and presentation was excellent.  Each dish is small, so 4-5 items per person will be about right.  

I drop one star because there was a pretty big discrepancy between the actual menu and the menu posted on their website..  The tasting menu options (e.g. Vegetarian indulgence), are not actually available at the restaurant.
