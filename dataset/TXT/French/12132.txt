4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I loved having brunch here. I made reservations through open table and was seated quickly. The service was excellent and the food delicious. I tried the fruit bowel in a cantaloupe cup. It was actually on the breakfast menu & even though we arrived for brunch they had no problems letting us order it. If you go for a celebration they will also give you a cream puff with ice cream. This was the highlight of the meal. I highly recommend everything here.
