fyJAqmweGm8VXnpU4CWGNw I've been meaning to try the French Grocery for a while now. Finally checked it out a few weekends ago and have been back three times since. The pot roast sandwich with a side of pomme frites is incredible and made for a great post Halloween hangover cure. The croissants are easily the best I've had and all of the sweets that I've tried have been perfect also.
