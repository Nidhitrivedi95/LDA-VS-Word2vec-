xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g For the price what you pay this is over rated I think a waiter should not ask every 2 minutes if you are ready, the quality of food is not to the best. If you are looking for quality and very good service you better go to Paris, France.

The restaurant is very loud for a romantic dinner for two 

I can not recommended this restaurant
