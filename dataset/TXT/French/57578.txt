rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Although countless famous chefs have a restaurant in Vegas, I have been constantly disappointed. It is really difficult to find good food in Vegas. So I was pleasantly surprised by Bouchon!

The space is bright and airy; I always try to stop by for brunch when in town. Someone always orders the Chicken & Waffles. This is not your average waffle; theirs is made with chives mixed in which gives it a kick. I usually order the Croque Madame here, really can't go wrong with that.

Request tables by the open windows which have views of the pools.
