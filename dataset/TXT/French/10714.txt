4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I went with high expectations in reading the reviews and the recommendation from the hotel, but was really dissapointed overall.  If all you are going for is the view of the fountain show across the street at the Bellagio, then definetly go, that was great.  We had 5 people and 4 of the 5 meals were over done and just plain boring.  Expect tourist food at a tourist location.  I won't be back.  I would prefer to stand across the street at the fountains, watch the show then go to a restaurant that has decent food.  Take a pass and find something else...
