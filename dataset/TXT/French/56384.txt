rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A What a nice breakfast this was. Beignets with chocolate spread and a latte per the servers advice. We even got a complimentary yogurt parfait which was a nice treat. Followed this with the omelet special of the day and it was all great. Very calm and casual with great food and great service.
