Yp9w4nhUowBU_IS_StFXbQ Nice and classy setting, but the food is mediocre. Nothing here really grabs me and trust me I went here for five straight days for breakfast/brunch and wasn't impressed by anything. The tableau breakfast is your best bet, even though all the items are over priced, this is the best bang for your buck. The acaii bowl was kind of a joke, the eggs benedict was like supermarket ham on a english muffin with a small amount of hollandaise sauce. The breakfast sandwich was something you would make at home. The coffee tore my stomach apart every morning and the grapefruit and orange juice were tasty, but the same price as two cartons. Lol. I went back for convenience of staying in the tower suites and didn't want to make breakfast a big production. Wait times with reservations can get out of hand here.
