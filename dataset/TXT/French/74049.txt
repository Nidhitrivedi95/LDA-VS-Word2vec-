xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g I loved pretty much everything about this place!! Once the elevator doors open into the restaurant you are greeted with a look into the kitchen and all the chefs in their crisp white jackets and chef hats scrambling around to get everything perfect. Instantly we felt like their number one guest because we were quickly seated at our table with not a minute of wait. There isn't a bad seat in the house, we were a party of 5 so we had a nice big table in the middle. Dinner couples of 2 get the best seats in the house right up to the window with a spectacular view. If you're lucky you'll even get to see the Bellagio water show! 

We shared the Beef Carpaccio for an appetizer. DELICIOUS. We gobbled up two plates of that within minutes! They then surprised us with a complimentary little shot glass full of carrot soup which was to die for. The perfect amount to keep our taste buds entertained before the main course. I had the Steak with bernaise sauce, medium well cooked to perfection, and the sauce (which came on the side) was tasty too. I cleaned my plate! Make sure to do the a la cart options as well. Their potatoes au gratin is literally the best i've ever tried in my life. (Sorry mom) 

Service was excellent. View was great. Food= amazing!!! I definitely want to go back next time i'm in Vegas and highly recommend it. Great for groups or a romantic dinner date! 

I just wish they didn't charge an extra 15$ to go to the top of the tower, especially after we just spent a chunk of change on dinner. :(
