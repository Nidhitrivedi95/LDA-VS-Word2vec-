xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g I have only had lunch here. Let's start with the view...amazing, we lucked out and got a window table with a perfect view of the Bellagio fountains and a nice sightline up and down the strip, I can only imagine the views to be even more breathtaking at night. As a whole the food was just slightly above average (but still above average and I have higher expectations than most) but there was a few hints of awesomeness tossed in. They bring out a bread basket and one of the little flatbread things in the basket was simply amazing, we sent the waiter back for thirds LOL and the potatoes crouqet were delish and I don't even normally like potatoes. Service was great as well.. Summary, you can definetly find a better meal in Vegas but probably not a better view/meal combo. I enjoyed it enough for lunch to go back and give it a try for dinner in the future.
