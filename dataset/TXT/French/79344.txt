ZIQrmmK86wQXVowgLsjW5A For a Michelin-rated restaurant, I would have expected to be blown away by the food, but my fellow diners and I were underwhelmed. The dining room was beautiful and the service excellent, but the food was mostly bland and un-inspired.  The amuse bouche and dessert were both pretty and creative, but the courses in between were not impressive.
