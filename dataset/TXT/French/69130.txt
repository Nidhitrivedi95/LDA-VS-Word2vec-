w2tr0PA0b3tg8pId0kjM-A I keep give this place so many chances and every single time it fails. Ive tried probably almost every single dessert there and there hasn't been anything I truly love. The presentation of every single item is sooooo beautiful but the taste is subpar for sure. Today they had a new item. A giant macaron with chocolate ganache and nuts. You'd think the macaron would be flawless since that's what they specialize in but half of it was stuck on the presentation plate and it was just hard and not flakey like a macaron. I'm not saying they tried to imitate la gournandine's big macaron but I want to say if you're expecting that quality you won't get it from here. I am someone who enjoys bakeries A LOT and this is one of my least favorites. For a French bakery I am very disappointed!
