SJo_IjvzdRtCvZVN0cbrRQ Just tried the Blue Door Cafe for breakfast this morning.  Super crowded but worth the wait.  Best corned beef hash ever!  The homemade jam was superb as was the freshly made English muffin.   No sign, but you can't miss the blue building and full parking lot.  Can't wait to go back and try their lunch or bring home some baked goods.
