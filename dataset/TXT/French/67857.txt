V0iYi5OjdRcz82m95jV7vQ If anyone likes Macaroons they know how delicious and addicting they are. They also know how insanely expensive they are too, which is why there can be no room for error. If I pay almost 3$  for a macaroon I expect it to be PERFECT! Unfortunately that was not the case here. The Macaroons all taste the same with no real authentic flavor to them. In addition to being flavorless, they also crumbled apart when you bite into them. They should be soft and chewy and I experienced the complete opposite. 

 The young lady behind the counter was friendly but I didn't get the same feeling from the arrogant "chef" who didn't even acknowledge the customer spending money in his bakery. I definitely won't return.
