kGOr_D-LNpgZ2M9N8TT4QQ We went here for our anniversary dinner. Out server was amazing and super accommodating with our two month old. We had the tuna tartare, thyme chicken and petit fillet. All dishes were exceptionally cooked. Tuna tartare was beyond expectation. My negatives for this place were the portion sizes and the amount of time it took between our appetizer and main course. We waited approximately 35 minutes after our appetizer for the main course to arrive. The amount they charged for the food given was not proportional either. Will I visit again... Probably not. I can find the same exceptional level of food at other yorkville restaurants that have bigger servings.
