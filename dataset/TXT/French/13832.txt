50-xiTYmE6NERi-yJ6NvHw I have to say... I was quite surprised by how delicious the salmon was at Biff's Bistro. The skin was nice and crispy, the fish just melts in your mouth and the sauce was perfect. Unfortunately, the creme brulee was a different story. It was torched to the point that it was as hard as a rock - if they made a rink of creme brulee, people can skate on it. 

If you do decide to try the place, I would highly recommend just getting the salmon!
