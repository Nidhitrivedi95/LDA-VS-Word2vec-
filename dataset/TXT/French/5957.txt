3rj1qpgFvkRWtAka17mhEQ I don't go to Mimi's for over a year, and I come back to a Denny's breakfast?

So, I had been to Mimi's many times for breakfast in the past.  It was certainly not a gourmet meal, but it was always a good place to get waffles and a side of potatoes.  Plus they had fresh-squeezed orange juice that I would always want, but then scoff at the price and decide against.

I hadn't been back to Mimi's in quite some time.  Not sure why.  But when I came back I couldn't believe how different the food was.  It still looked pretty much the same, but I guess the quality had gone downhill.

The eggs were bland, the waffle was bland, and the potatoes that I used to love were awful.  They were too soft and, you guess it, bland.  Plus the orange juice was from a carton- but the good news is they lowered the price.

My husband and I both left half of the food on our plates.  That is highly unusual.

Sorry, Mimi's, but I don't think I'll be back for quite some time again.
