ANHCo9X7zu0LdYecc9fk3Q It's an airport location so expect a line and chaos. Customers don't know where the line is so at times its a free for all to place an order. Most of the sandwich selections are pre-made and under a hot light. I only stop by to purchase cookies and pastries after hitting a different spot for actual food a guy can admit to eating. There were a couple college girls today sitting around with berets on their heads looking silly. I guess if you want to be Frenchie this is the only place in the airport to do it. I have never ordered more than desserts so I cannot talk about the food. My delectables are always great but way more than I wish I'd spent.
