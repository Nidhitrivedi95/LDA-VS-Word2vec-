Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA This restaurant was terrible from start to finish. The decor is cool BUT the tables for two are way too close together and there are a bunch of big tables in the middle that are not being used. 
The drinks were awful - no creativity at all, especially for an $18 martini. 
The food was barely edible. I ordered the white bean soup which was bland. The egg roll that accompanied it was so greasy and I couldn't taste the veggies inside. My husband's filet was undercooked. The gnocchi was mushy and tasteless. We opted out of dessert. They gave us a little freebie which was a homemade Madeline with Nutella dipping sauce. Not exciting or gourmet at all.
What a disappointing meal!!!
