ovtlrcsVRlgZZQUlHs_ovw 'Man up' boys and remember what Mommy [should have] taught you. LADIES FIRST. Although the staff was attentive to our table of 6, why did they first serve him the same entree I ordered? They filled the guys water glasses and emptied the pitcher before filling the ladies. Food was fine. Onion soup and 'lasagna in the bowl' were very good. Cioppino was as expected. Almost everything had a twist; Bruschetta was really thick and warm and lacked fresh toppings, the 'fresh bread' was either toasted or dry, lasagna and eggplant were in bowls, calamari looked like a giant fried onion. I probably won't go back.
