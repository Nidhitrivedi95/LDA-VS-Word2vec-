4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Fantastic food!! We came here for breakfast and ahhh, right in the shade with a view of the Bellagio right across the street. :)

We got the specials, a lemon crepe and a shrimp eggs benedict biscuit and both were sooooo good! We got some bellinis to drink (like a peach mimosa) and those were great too so we got seconds, haha. :)

Wonderful place for food right on the strip!

Oh, you can call ahead for reservations if you like. We waited about 15 min for a patio seat on a Friday morning and just chilled at the bar. Call ahead to save time. ;)
