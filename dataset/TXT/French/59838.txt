sAOgSr6suAE4axjIFSbtLQ At long last, I was able to visit The Wine Cellar with the hubs (Nicole's word).  The atmosphere is cozy but not private.  If you sit on one of the comfy sofas, you get to look at other patrons.  In any case, when you're having a glass of vino (or a bottle), who cares!  The staff was excellent and recommended a very nice red blend that was not yet on the menu.  I give the wine 5/5. After tasting, it was definitely a winner.  I will give the  cheese tray 3/5; it was okay.  Some of the cheese were not favorable with the wine selection.  More visits to this local establishment are definitely in order, especially on a lazy evening. The place grew more crowded as the evening wore on.  If you are visiting with friends, arrive early evening to secure a few tables, or the sitting area in the middle.
