4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw One of the better places to eat right now on the Strip.  Nice ambiance especially if you are sitting outside at night during the spring/fall, solid service, and good food with a fairly varied menu that tends to be a bit heavy on the meat dishes.  Not the most friendly place to bring a vegetarian let alone a vegan.  Its not authentic, high-end French cuisine but then again it is Vegas.  

Sitting outside though can be a bit noisy with all of the traffic on the Strip.  You can hear your dinner companions but you have to speak up a bit.  The wait can be a bit outrageous though but that's common with any half-decent restaurant on the Strip.

All-in-all, there are a lot of terrible, overpriced restaurants on the Strip.  This isn't one of them.  This place is a bit more expensive but at least the food, service, and outdoor seating are all positives.
