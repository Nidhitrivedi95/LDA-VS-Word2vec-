xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g We had an excellent meal at the Eiffel. It was a business dinner at 8 on a Friday and we were escorted right away to our table. The menu was great with an extensive wine list. I opted for the sea bass and I was very happy with my choice. The view was fantastic! The service was top of the line. It's a bit pricey but definitely worth it for a special occasion. I would definitely come back.
