yU3p0tEBtGuZLTcsBHw9uQ I've eaten here twice, once on the deck and the other time inside.  Both environments were calm in the morning and I enjoyed the music selections and the quiet.  The server was attentive and very kind.  I had the panko french toast both times and upon another visit to Montréal in the future, will probably not stray from this selection :)
