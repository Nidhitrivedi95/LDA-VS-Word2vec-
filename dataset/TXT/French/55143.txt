rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A This was to be our big splurge for the trip.  I was hoping for one of those all-time unforgettable meals, but it was only OK. 
My husband ordered the salmon pate for a starter, and, though it was a fun presentation and a tasty combination of two kinds of salmon and creme fraiche, a little went a long way.

Probably my biggest complaint about our meal overall was proportion. Way too much of a good thing is a bad thing. 

We felt like we ought to finish the big pot of salmon pate, but then along comes my enormous bowl of steamed mussels so full that no human could have finished it. There were probably 60 in the bowl. After the 25th, I just started to feel sick. And the gorgeous french fries that came with it went completely untouched, because if there's one thing the mussels had to much of (besides mussels,) it was salt. 
Wanting a green veg, I ordered a side of spinach which was great for the first couple of bites, but it was swimming in butter
.
I will say the bread was wonderful, and the wine was terrific. I had Pinot Gris and my husband had the Syrah with his Beoff Bourgonoine, which he devoured.
So, Bouchon, if you're reading this--please consider shrinking your portion sizes, reconsider the pairing of fries with the mussels, and lighten up on the salt already. Thanks.
