XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q Ok, it has been about a month since I visited Joel Robuchon's restaurant, but I just found my notes and thought I would finally post my review.

First, I made reservations about two months prior, but when I showed up with my dining companion, we were told their would be a slight wait.  The wait turned out to be 35 minutes.  Unacceptable.

Finally we walk in and my companion is delighted to find that she will be sitting on a purple couch.  Purple being her favorite color, the 35 minute wait was almost forgotten at that point.

Our waiter appeared and greeted us.  He was followed by the gentleman presenting to us the AMAZING bread cart.  I would come back here just for the warm bread and the selection of butters. Yum.

We decided on the 16 course menu and settled in.  Our waiter hovered over us the entire time.  I cannot tell you how annoyed this made me (especially when you are trying to have a romantic evening with some romantic chit chat.)  I actually asked him nicely several times to please stand somewhere else, but he ignored the request.

I must say I was not impressed with the presentation of our courses.  For a $1000 meal, I expected the presentation to be MUCH better.  It was plain and uninspired.

The food was good.  Nothing to write home about. I prefer Daniel in NYC more.

All-in-all, it was a decent meal. Not worthy of the price in my opinion.
