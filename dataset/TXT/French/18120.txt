A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g I was having Bottega Louie withdrawals and was looking for a smaller French bakery to get my macaron on! Came here after studying with the bestie, and I'm so glad I made the visit. Although, they're going on "summer break" soon. 

Let's start with the good: MACARONS. $1 Macarons were welcoming. I had the Salted Caramel and Chocolate Mint. Salted Caramel: AMAZING. Mint Chocolate: EW. I love this place but this just tasted like bad toothpaste! I also ordered the black forest cake. It was just okay. It honestly just tasted like chocolate cake to me and wasn't anything out of this world. 

I hope to come back and try other pastries and the sandwiches as well. 

The biggest point, I would say, is the decoration and branding. There is definitely some renovation to be done here. My sisters described the place as "spooky," which is the opposite of what a place with great food like this should be. Also, it was a bit confusing to see that the biggest sign on the building actually said french pastry & bakery rather than the actual Patisserie's name. Definitely has great potential though!
