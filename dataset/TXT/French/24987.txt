Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA I love this place. The Lobster Curry is the must have dish. I convinced 5 other people at my table to order it and no one was disappointed. The house made ice cream was the perfect way to end my meal.

And I would be remiss if I didn't mention the view! The strip shines beneath you. Tip: use the bathroom on the bar/lounge side. There are floor to ceiling windows in the stalls. At night it is incredible!
