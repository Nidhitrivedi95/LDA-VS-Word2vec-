xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g My mom surprised me in Vegas for my 30th birthday and took me here for a FABULOUS birthday dinner. I didn't even know this place existed! You take an elevator up and the views are fabulous. It was very impressive!

The food is just melt-in-your-mouth amazing, the service is top notch without being stuffy, and they really went above and beyond to make it a very special night. We were continually brought bread, waters refilled, and even given a great tasting cauliflower soup (sounds a little weird but tasted awesome), compliments of the chef. The food was delicious and the service was exceptional. The waitress was so on top of her game, it was probably the best service we ever had. She was great, yet wasn't stuffy -- she was very personable and made us feel comfortable. When my mom made the reservations, she asked them to include roses on the table. They had a dozen of the most beautiful red roses ever -- they are seriously perfect and still thriving! I got to take them home in the vase, and the waitress provided a great gift bag to make carrying them out easier. The are full and open, still looking and smelling as beautiful today as they did this past weekend at the restaurant! She also brought out a birthday dessert, in addition to the delicious souffle that my mom loved. My mom also asked them to bring out a jewelry gift she had gotten me, with dessert -- they brought it out on a platter and had written Happy Birthday on the plate. They didn't skimp on anything here -- everything was fabulous! It was the greatest dining experience and they helped my mom make my birthday truly special and unforgettable!
