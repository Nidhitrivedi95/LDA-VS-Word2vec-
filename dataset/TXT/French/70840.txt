xBxDMEkFK5GBhiy-8gGE9w One of my favorite french restos in Montreal. I come here at least once every time my mother is in town. Their tartars are amazing and the ribs are delicious. They serve mayo with their fries - won my European heart in an instant. Great drinks and wine menu! very friendly and helpful staff.
