KRgTdfs4oVFUcATMfAoR4A Family occasion, table for 10. Set menu (busy F1 weekend) was superb. Lots of choice.

Service
Service was excellent. Great wine list. Just what you want in a local Brasserie in a pleasant street 

Room
Classic modern Brasserie: busy but not too noisy. Starch white table cloths.

Food
Tomato Soup, Salmon Tartare, Bavette de Veau, Chocolate Brut. Classics done well. Only complaint was that fries tasted a bit of old grease and were not crispy.

I would go back. 4 and a half stars. Great evening!
