DOmVF9YKOvTkqjcgUwtOgQ This was a nice experience in downtown Montreal.  The restaurant has that modern, euro feel to it and the bar is very inviting.  

I had the salmon for dinner and the crabcake appetizer and both were excellent.  The service was good and the wine was tasty.   The sorbet desert was also very delish. 

The only drawback was that the doors and windows were open which on most nights would be inviting but it was so warm and muggy it would have been better to use the AC.  

I would certainly go back and plan to if in the area.  

Enjoy!
