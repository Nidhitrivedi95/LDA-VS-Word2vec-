SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ First of all, the outdoor dining area is beautiful and I really liked the Hippy squirrel cocktail I started with.  The bread was, frankly, sorry and the butter left a film in my mouth.  My kale salad was very nice and quite a large portion with big fresh boysenberries.  It took an extraordinarily long time to recieve my entree; pistachio encrusted diver scallops on special.  While the scallop were prepared nicely, the dish just looked like a mess and wasn't worth the price IMO for 3 smallish scallops.  Overall, my meal did not meet expectations based on other reviews.
