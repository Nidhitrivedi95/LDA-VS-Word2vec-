EG3drsohiIrBewmOYMNEuA I had: Quatre fromages 11.50
(Fromage brie, cheddar, suisse et bleu sur une galette végétarienne, tomates, laitue et basilic / Brie cheese, cheddar, swiss and blue over a vegetarian patty, tomatoes, lettuce and basil)
As expected, there was a bit too much cheese going on.  I didn't think I'd ever say that, but it's true in this case.  The veggie burger itself was tasty, as was the roll on which it was served.  The waffle fries were a bit on the greasy side, but the side salad was good (if not a little too soaked in dressing).  I highly recommend the Blonde ou Rousse beer on draft.  YUM.
