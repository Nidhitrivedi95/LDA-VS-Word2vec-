My family and I went for Thanksgiving.  The menu was set at $145 for a set five courses meaning that each course was averaging $29.  

The first course was a lobster salad which was decent, but nothing to write home about.  

The second course was 1.5-2oz of parmesan risotto.  Also good, but nothing spectacular.  

Third course was sea bass wrapped in potato.  Inventive, but not only dry, but I was served an unacceptable piece of fish, certainly not one that should exist in a restaurant with this price structure.  

Fourth course, the supposed turkey which was an approximately 1.5"x1.5" square.
When I cut into it there was a huge blood vessel running through the center.  Nice. They also forgot my drizzle of sweet potato.  Additional items including a solitary piece of asparagus that had been bisected, perhaps a teaspoon of cranberry sauce, and a rolled up item I was told was a combination of dark meat and stuffing that was an measured perhaps 3/4 of an ounce.  When I told the staff of the issue with the meat requesting a new plate with a normal sized portion of turkey, sweet potatoes and asparagus guess what I got?  The same tiny portions, but at least this time the turkey was edible.  

The only real stand out for this meal was the last course which was a chocolate dome with hazelnut praline and icecream inside.  Hot chocolate was poured over the top to melt into the top of the dome.  Inventive and delicious.  

This will definitely be marked as the one Thanksgiving I had where I wasn't stuffed.
