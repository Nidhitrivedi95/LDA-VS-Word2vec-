4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I am in LOVE with this place! I did not know gluten-free meals can be this delicious! I am gluten-sensitive so I try to make my meals as gluten-free as possible. So when I saw they had a whole separate menu for gluten-free meals, I was totally excited. I ordered their salmon and leek quinoa and OMG it was so delicious. And to top that off, I had a bottle of gluten-free beer :) I want to go back for more.

The service was pretty good, but I did get the feeling our waiter hasn't worked there for too long. When I asked him for any recommendations from the gluten-free menu he seemed a little lost. But he did recommend the salmon and leak quinoa and said the dish is a little spicy so I ordered it because I love spicy! Funny thing, my dish was not one bit spicy, but it didn't matter because it was delicious regardless! What I am trying to say is I don't think the waiter should have made recommendations of a dish he knew not much about.

Anyways , this is definitely a place you want to check out if you are in Vegas.
