QEgfK_TKY8bwK-YzKDdkGw What a lovely restaurant, once you have stepped inside. We were very warmly greeted and sat at our table immediately, we wee right on time. 7pm reservation. I would have given 4.5 star if possible. They lost the half star due to the noise level that seems to be  a part of a dining experience. 
Our server was friendly and attentive. The amuse bouche was a very piping hot demitasse of a puréed version of French onion soup. It was quite delicious. It was accompanied by a couple of gougeres. Slightly undercooked, but tasty. E started with the Bourgogne. Succulent escargots and baby button mushrooms in a puff pastry. Followed by the braised pork belly with braised greens, fried quail egg and the most delicious smoked broth. Our main courses arrive s with just the right amount of pause. We noticed the the chef working the pass was watching the tables to make sure food want getting out too soon. It seems so anyway. It was perfectly orchestrated. As the courses were served I noticed, at not only our table but others, that the ladies were served first and from the left ever time. That was very refreshing. Not all fine dining restaurants seem to remember this. Our mains were both equally delightful. The only small carp I had was with the sea bass dish.  It was presented Provincial, the olives were over powering the other flavors. Dessert was a flourless chocolate torte with raspberries, toasted marshmallow fluff and hazelnut ice cream. Yum. At the end of that very favorable indulgence our serve brought us one more offering. A small Chinese Togo box with macaroons. Lovely.
