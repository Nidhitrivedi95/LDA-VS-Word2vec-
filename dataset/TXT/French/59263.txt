rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w Every time I come to this particular Le Cirque - the one in Vegas - i am so enamored and enchanted and charmed not only by the beautiful decoration that is magical but also by the food, which is absolutely exquisitely plated and designed for taste and for aesthetics. But mostly I leave here more enamores because of the service that one receives when they come to Las Vegas Le Cirque.
It must be mentioned that all or at least most of the waitstaff are originally foundational stuff meaning they been there for some 20 years.
It is professional,  a career and carried out with such aplomb and such attention to detail  towards making the evening a delightfully pleasant one, though not pretentious by any means.
Our servers that evening were Tom and Javier and course there are visits to the table by other dignitaries who offer amuse bouche and other delights courtesy of the chef along with your 3,5 or 10 course delight.
I will not go into detail of the amazing libations and delightful morsels to experience here, suffice it to say it is a spectacle to behold.
