Menu is multi-lingual and staff is very accommodating.  Food was exceptional and the kids devoured their dishes .. beet salad, ravioli and spaghetti.  The kir royal and Malbec were lovely. The duck fois gois was great, the goat cheese salad was also quite nice.  Poached salmon was very well prepared and extremely flavorful. The grain fed chicken was amazing as well.  

We were lucky to get in without a reservation but we went in before 5pm on a Tuesday.  It filled up by 6pm and had clientele from around the world but also a fair share of locals. 

Worth the trip for a family looking to try something new and yet accessible.
