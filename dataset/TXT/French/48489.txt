ohMpNug5zWNxOlL6ShG7Ig Before Cafe Bink the only reason I went to Carefree was to visit the Boulders Resort.    My only complaint about the resort was that there were a limited amount of great dining experiences within a stones throw, until Cafe Bink. 

This is a must try if you are in the area.  Cafe Bink is a small restaurant and bar in the middle of strip mall.  The food that comes out of the kitchen is first class french bistro food taken up a notch.  The braised pork appetizer was to die for.  Juicy but not overly fatty with a maple glaze.  I had the crispy game hen which was their take on chicken and dumplings.  Perfectly done with a crisp exterior with a tender juicy interior.  My wife had their bolognese which was a kicked up bolognese sauce served with creamy polenta.  Also they we had a side of fries (their speciality) which came with all things truffled ketchup.  

OVerall this is a great little oasis in the middle of the high dessert north of Scottsdale.  The portions are generous and the wait staff is knowledga\ible, attentive and friendly.  The wine list is diverse with a lot of selections by the class.  Not just your chardonnay and cabernet line up!  I enjoyed an Argentine Pinot Noir from a vineyard that I never heard up.  It was marvelous. 

Enjoy.
