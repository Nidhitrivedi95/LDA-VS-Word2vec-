kGOr_D-LNpgZ2M9N8TT4QQ Came in for lunch for winterlicoius 2015. 
Very courteous staff and wonderful decor. The ceiling certainly adds a nice touch to the atmosphere and the bistro style tables were an excellent layout. The noise level was ridiculously loud. It was a little annoying at first, but after a while it settled down as we reached the tail end of the lunch hour.

I had the oysters as the appetizer which were neatly presented but nothing too extravagant. The duck confit however was very good, although just a tad on the dry side.
Main course was very disappointing. We were unable to order the salmon since they ran out and had to settle for the pan seared chicken. While cooked and presented well, the taste got boring after a couple of bites. The potatoes made for a good side, but I was fed up with the chicken very quickly.
Dessert did make up for the rest of the meal which was the warm chocolate cake. A great pair with the ice cream. 
I would consider returning during non-winterlicious times, and explore some of the other adventures in their cuisine.
