kKC7UTcHZM3zLfT97x3msg We came here for my birthday and I couldn't have been more impressed... The 22 course tasting menu, yes 22 courses, was outstanding. It's very rare for every item on the tasting menu to be consistently delicious. Frank and team have obviously put a lot of thought into each dish. The host and waiters provided  impeccable service. This is easily one of the top three restaurants in Toronto right now.
