9mG2yOnHtxVPEM1p8FqycA Read this review while keeping in mind that I am biased by the fact that every time I go here it's a cold and very snowy night.  Perhaps this makes the pastries flakier and more satisfying or the hot chocolate more comforting.  I have had other pastries and hot chocolate under similar circumstances and none has met the high standard set by Figaro.

I sought to find the best croissant in Montreal and went forth with my list of suggestions from a multitude of sources.  Unfortunately I went looking on New Year's Day so many of the places on my list were closed.  Dejected, frustrated and sans croissant fix we stopped in Caffe in Gamba where we chatted with someone who told us about Figaro.  It wasn't far which was lucky since we had worn ourselves out in our search so far.

On my second trip I tried again to find a better croissant but discovered that none was to be found and La Croissanterie Figaro continues to reign supreme.

Just for the record, my idea of the perfect croissant is one that is very buttery with crispy distinct layers with a softer inside but not too cakey or rubbery.  There should be dark golden flakes on your plate after eating it.

Their hot chocolate was also divine.  We liked that it isn't sweetened so you can add as much as you want or none at all. It was delicious without any sugar added.
