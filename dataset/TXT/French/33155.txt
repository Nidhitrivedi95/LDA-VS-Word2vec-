HHvO4MgBFabsmlInou6viQ Great little place in the Dundas West Neighbourhood. Came here cuz it was close to my friends house. Pleasant surprise everything taste amazing and really reminded me of France. The chef is very nice and so was service. I came back another time, the food wasn't as perfect as the first time, maybe because the chef was not working that day. I will be back to try their Brunch Menu.
