T4g4k2OhCTsiqcP-ZXElHQ I must admit that my visit to Jules was over 2 years ago, but I still remember the details of my visit vividly....I had the grilled tuna for a late lunch-seating was not an issue-and it was perfection...the vinaigrette...it's been 2 years and I still remember! The service was cold, but all was forgiven with the delicious meal and awesome crepe with caramelized apples that I had for dessert...and the coffee...great even though I had it black..my cream and sugar request would apparently offend the beans and my dessert, I'm glad she ignored my request! All in all, should I find myself in Toronto again, I will definitely go back. As a matter of fact, I always recommend it to friends that travel there and to family that lives there, nay I insist they go.
