Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA Pretend upscale makes me sick.  terrible service and mediocre food.  i understand mandalay bay is stuck at the end of the strip but I would make the trek to a better restaurant at a better hotel.  I've never hated a restaurant so much in my entire life.  I will NEVER stay at mandalay bay or go back to mix.  it's gross.  there's a reason people don't want to stay at MB anymore.  it's because they don't care about service or quality.
