The man who (I'm assuming is the owner) personally spoke to us and asked as what we were in the mood for and showed us a bunch of recommendations and even swayed my decision. The peach almond pastry I had was superb and the people I was with loved the Honey Burger and the Pecan pastry was equally as awesome.
