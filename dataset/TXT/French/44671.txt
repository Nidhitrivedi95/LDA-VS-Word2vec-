mnn--vaYHtNyBNYFYBFIog I came here with high expectations for the food, service, and the price.  

I had the seven course tasting menu (115$), which required the whole table to participate. (There are also options to order individual entrees and appetizers). The tasting menu is also a surprise.

Here are a few points....

1. The restaurant itself it elegant without appearing too stilted or stuffy. The wine cellar serves as a beautiful centerpiece.
2. The tasting menu was quite good, but it is something you should approach with caution for 2 reasons: 1. If you do tasting menus, sea snails, fois gras terrine, bone marrow, duck hearts, etc., won't come as all that big of a surprise. 2. If you don't, these things may not suit your palate.
3. I had a scallops dish and a sea snails dish that were the best two courses. The cheese plate was unfocused, and the squash ice cream for dessert was high on surprise, but a bit lower on delicious. The bone marrow was better than any I have had, but part of me hopes the bone marrow craze passes soon.
4. The service was befitting of a fine restaurant. The only snags came later in the meal when my table was only offered coffee half way through dessert and not offered after dinner drinks.

Would I go back? Yes. However, I might skip the tasting menu.
