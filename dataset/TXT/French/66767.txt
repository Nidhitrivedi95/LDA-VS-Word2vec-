UpEVdq_euH-5mqCIgUAd2Q First the good: The ambiance is very nice and the staff are pleasant.  

But - we've eaten here a couple of times and it's very overpriced for the quality. $26 for a small piece of overdone salmon and a scoop of boring rice, come on now. At $160 per couple, I also expect my glass of wine not to smell of bleach. 

Finally, the service to our table of 7 was also painfully slow.  It took an hour and a half to get our appetizers (and they were not busy). 

With so many creative and well run restaurants to choose from in downtown Toronto, we won't be spending our money here again. It's too bad because the menu has some interesting choices you don't see often (such as crepes and tourtiere).
