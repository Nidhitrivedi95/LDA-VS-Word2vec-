zw4Legbcu018p5WcZ74iWA Visited on a weekday around midday and there were two seats by the window which was perfect for me and my friend. As noted by others, the venue IS small - and I like it that way.

The poutine, both plain/original and the one with bell pepper and olives, was delicious! Better than at Rapido (ugh.) and on par with La Banquise's classic. 

At that time of day it was busy but not jam packed, and service was good. Not stressed, with a relaxed and casual vibe. The guy serving was super nice and friendly, laughing and joking with us. He even posed for a photo for my friend. 

The Summer sun streaming through the window and we sat, chatted and people-watched as locals and visitors aliked passed by on Boul. Saint-Laurent. So the entire experience was romantic and magical, a lot like Montreal really ;)

So this is now my fave poutine place in Mtl. Bon Appetite!
