rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A This review is for the waitress...

Don't get me wrong, food is great, and the busboy did awesome job to covering the waitress.


Let start in the beginning.
Sat down.... No one give us water on one care about we are sitting here....
5+ min later the waitress finally show up give us water.
Then she disappear....

10 min passed.... I went to the restroom came back and my girlfriend told me she hadn't order the food yet.... Guess what? Because the waitress haven't come by yet.....

Then the busboy came and ask us are we ready to order.... He went to find the waitress.  She was standing at the back corner talking to another waiter....

Finally get ordered our food...

Food is great...

For the whole meal, the waitress only stop by 2 times to refill the coffee....

The busboy fill up my cup of water 4 times...

Finish our food, ready to go...

Nope, waitress is refilling the sugar at her little corner this time...
Waited for 3 min and the busboy saw us finish our food.... He came over and ask us are we ready for the check..... I was like...Dude... You are doing way more than you get pay for....

He told the waitress we are ready for the check.... Awesome... Another 5 min of waiting her refilling the sugar and get our check...

This is not a Denny's...This is not IHOP... This is a restaurant inside a 5 stars hotel.... 

If I am getting a $50 lunch and with this level of service???  Sorry, no thank you.
