As you can see from many of the reviews, especially the lower rated ones, they are almost all lower because the reviewer stated "too much fat" etc. If you look at the other ratings, as of mine, that are 3 stars or below, you will notice a trends, food too rich.... I also laughed at some of the reviews that are lower rated, but they liked the "salad". Come on people, if you like salads and lite food, DON'T GO HERE. 

Yes, this is true, too much fat, too much excess, too much everything. That is the point of this place. French country cooking to the extreme. Don't go here if you don't want to feel like you just ate a pound of butter after. 

Go here if you want to experience the most savory, succulent goodness Quebec has to offer. I have posted 8 pictures of the dishes we ordered. All unreal in flavor and presentation. 

We only had one night to experience this place so we ordered way too much. If I had more time in Montreal, I'd like go here early with friends, order one dish, and share it, before going for cocktails and a late dinner elsewhere. Also, I would recommend if you want to experience more dishes here, go multiple nights. The servings are huge. The pigs foot alone would feed a entire family plus left overs.
