KWoXY9-R00NY-Rv_MSNwaQ Writing this review as a warning - This ranked as one of the worst meals I've ever had.  French onion soup that was just gross - A pile of soggy onions.  Followed by walleye that was obviously frozen and had nothing but the flavor of some kind of green raw garlic mash sprinkled on top.  The place looks inviting, but I got sloppy and didn't check Yelp before going in.  Drowned my sorrows and washed some of the bad aftertaste away in the Ben & Jerry's across the way.
