A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g Talk about a DE-LIC-IOUS French bakery with friendly staff and a huge variety of deserts to choose from. 

I noticed there was a lot of hype coming from friends saying it's the best French bakery and on 7/26/14, I finally got to see what the hype was all about. 

Needless to say, they lived up to my expectations for THE best French bakery ... ever? Maybe!?

I went to the bakery with my sister, her boyfriend and my girlfriend. There was so much to choose from we all decided to get a few items and share them. 

My girlfriend and I got a chocolate eclair - 9/10

My sister got flan - 9.5/10

My sisters boyfriend got macaroons (too many to remember) - 10/10

If you're coming here expecting to be frugal, this bakery is probably not the best choice. 

Quality comes at at a price but trust me, the price is well worth it. 

I'll be coming back again soon!
