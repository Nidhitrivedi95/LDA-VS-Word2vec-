eJ9L40jm5VOXCIq7xs9kQw Bonaparte is by far our favorite restaurant we have been to since we have been together! To start, the staff is wonderful! They are absolutely lovely, attentive, knowledgeable, polite, and friendly.
The good is outstanding. We started with the lobster bisque and the escargot. Wow! Delightful!
The main course... I can't stop talking about it! The lobster linguini was just incredible. I thought I was getting bits of lobster with a full plate of linguini... was I wrong!  I had a full lobster with a small side of linguini and vegetables! We can't say enough about this restaurant! It is an absolute must if you visit Old Montreal!
