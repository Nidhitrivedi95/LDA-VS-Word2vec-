xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g I absolutely adore this restaurant. It is my Vegas tradition - I come here every trip! 

It may seem like a cheesy idea at first, but it quickly wins you over. Every person I have brought with me falls in love with the restaurant too. 

The view is incredible - the best in Vegas. I love watching the Bellagio fountains and seeing the rest of the strip. 

And the menu is divine. I try a new entree every time (go with items that have an Eiffel tower icon by them...you cannot go wrong with those!) but stick with a bottle of champagne and cheese plate for an appetizer. Their mixed drinks are tasty but come with sticker shock - $17 for a tiny cocktail is a bit too ridiculous for me. Ask for a bottle of wine instead!

Their desserts are also a must. My favorite is the creme brulee but each one can hold its own!

If you have time, go up to the top of the tower after your meal. The view is spectacular!
