ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug We had about 8 people in our party and got seated right away.  The food did take forever to come, and we were super hungry! I ordered tri tip sandwhich - The food was overall OK. Maybe I should have ordered something else because everyone else liked what they had ordered. I loved how the check was all in french though.
