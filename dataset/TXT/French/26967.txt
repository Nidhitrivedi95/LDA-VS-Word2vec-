Dcj69NZJnbJhK-YHP_nULA We were pleasantly surprised by Brasserie V!  The food we ordered wasn't anything out of the ordinary (Smoked Turkey and V Burger) but both were absolutely fantastic. Everything was well-seasoned, and the portions were right on the mark. The beer selection was great, and the bartender that served us was really helpful and nice. 

Can't wait to go back!
