EPb3FWs3mxQLUjGeMNP0SQ Was staying at the hotel next door... Got into Montreal late and so decided to just come here to grab a bite to eat because it was easy.  I was seriously underwhelmed.  With all the good food in Montreal, this place cannot get away with charging the prices they do for mediocre food and drinks.  Had the duck wings which I suspect we're actually turkey (dry), the beet salad with shrimp (blech) and the crab cake, which was the best part of the meal.  Drinks were overly sweet.

Not worth it.
