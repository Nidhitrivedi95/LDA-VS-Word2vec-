ohMpNug5zWNxOlL6ShG7Ig A friend and I recently ate at this restaurant and were completely dissatisfied with the quality of the food we ordered.  My friend ordered the salmon and when it came out it had a fishy taste and smell, not to mention after she took off the large portion of skin that was still on the fish, it was only about 3 ounces.   My friend didn't want to make a scene and have to wait 20 25 minutes for another item, so they only ate bread and veggies.

I ordered the BBQ ribs that were suggested by our waitress and I could not believe how bad they were.   I enjoy smoking ribs and have my own homemade sauce so I think I am a good critic of ribs.   These things had no taste, stingy meat and yes they fell off the bone, but were probably boiled or at least it appeared that is how they cooked their ribs.

I contacted the management via their website and told them about our terrible dining experience, and guess what, not even a reply, not even we are sorry that you were not happy.

Normally I would not send out a negative post  about a restaurant that I had a bad experience at, and just never go back, but felt that I needed to share our bad dining experience so you can judge for yourself whether Café Bink is worth the time and effort.   

There are other good restaurants in the immediate area that I would recommend you try.
