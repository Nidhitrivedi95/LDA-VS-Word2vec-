gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA This place was the most amazing place by far to eat in Las Vegas. 

The staff was amazingly conscious of us and our needs. Very nice, always refilling our drinks, and on top of everything we asked for. We even got a few desert treats from the Chef. 

For an app we had Calamari, and holy cow. All we kept saying was "wow".

My husband had the ribeye, medium rare, and he couldn't stop raving about it. Hes a huge steak guy and is so very picky about how well his meat is prepared. This was stellar.

I had Irish Seared Salmon with Crab. Wonderfully prepared, the potatoes it came with were beyond delicious. 

Our desert was a chocolate fondant with vanilla bean ice cream. BEST DESERT EVER. The chocolate was sweet without being overpowering or too rich. The ice cream had a buttery and sweet taste that (being from Wisconsin) rivals even the best ice cream Ive ever had.

This is a place that is well worth the price. We spent $150 for a martini, an app, 2 entrees, and desert. Well worth it! We are planning to make this a place to eat every time were in Vegas.

OHHH.. and the view.. SPECTACULAR!
