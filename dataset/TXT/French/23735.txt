cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg Wow. Need I say more. Well I will. If you haven't understood from the other reviewers, this place is amazing. You must get reservations here as it is so popular, that it is always filled. We had reservations and still waited for almost an hour, but the wait was well worth it. If you are looking for a large sign to Au Pied De Cochon, then you are looking for another restaurant. APDC may be a connoisseurs dream come true, but it is not have a flashy environment. APDC's fame comes from its delicious menu of sea food, duck in a can, bison tongue and wines to name a few. 

I had the bison tongue as an appetizer. I know, that sounds gross, but it truly has a wonderful taste that I've never tasted before. I then had bison ribs and shared my friends sea food platter of clams, mussels, snails, and something else. I'm not a big fan of mussels or clams, but the rest were wonderfully delicious. 

As far as waiting services, though they are hot, I did not feel as though they were the best. I have had better, but I'm not there for the service. I'm there for the food. 

If you want some of the best food in Montreal or maybe in all of Canada, then you must try Au Pied De Cochon.
