4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I wanted to try something different that I can't get at home, and heard great reviews on Yelp. The waitress was super nice and friendly. She even gave us recommendations on cool things to do away from the strip. I ordered the seafood crepe and it was amazing! Doesn't look like much but it's so flavorful. The shrimp and scallops are pretty big too.
