vLkKorA1gPS97Zj0_WKA0Q Another great experience! I think the foie gras was even better this time! The level of service was incredible. They actually welcomed me back by name, which was a nice touch. We had the same table and waiter. The rabbit dish (they affectionately refer to it as "Roger") was delish! The langostine was fantastic (except for the poached dish--I really cant stomach poached crustaceans).  Presentation was impeccable.  I'll be back!
