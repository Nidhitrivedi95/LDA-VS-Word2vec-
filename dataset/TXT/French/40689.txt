KbBMhk_G57WQ2M_9srNbCQ All the food was delicious! We went for a friend's birthday, we were a group of 12. The place is loud, but if you are ok with that, then it's totally worth it. Bring your own wine is a plus. The oysters were great, the tuna tartare melts in your mouth. I will definitely return. 

(The place is similar to the Wellington but younger and louder. Turns out it's the same owners.)
