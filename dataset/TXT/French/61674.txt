sMAgnsqi-eY9LlywVC85Hg Had dinner here on New Year's Eve and it was amazing!

The entire experience really made for a great night. The decor was lovely and felt very warm & inviting. I'm not sure if this happens regularly, but there was live music playing - it sounded like there was a piano player on the first floor, and they alternated performances with a violinist and guitar player on the second floor (where we were). The violinist was very engaging and walked around the floor during some of their songs. They were greeted with applause from the restaurant after every song. 

The food was delicious - we had the duck confit appetizer to start off which was a good size. For entrees, we had the rack of lamb (suggested by the waiter) and the catch of the day (Cajun cod fillet) - both were great. We also had a bottle of wine.

Our waiter made sure to come back frequently and refill our sparkling water and wine - we were never left with an empty glass. We definitely felt well taken care of.

We were so full by the end of our meal, or we would've tried some dessert. I'll definitely be returning the next time I'm in Montreal!
