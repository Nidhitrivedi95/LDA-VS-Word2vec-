v50-nvBCZNf7nCNbyUlQLw Great place to have breakfast/lunch. The crepes are great and the coffee is just what you expect in an independent coffee house (excellent)! 

Each time I visit Pittsburgh I have to eat there at least once, I try to hit it twice.  Not only is the food great (not fried and fresh fruit is used when available) the atmosphere is very fun for all ages.

Be sure to take a pocket full of quarters though, Pittsburgh has cash only parking meters. The meters on Craig St. are 1 hour max but, a quarter does buy you half an hour.
