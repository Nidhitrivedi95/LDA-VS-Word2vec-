mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q Maybe they had a bad night, maybe we went on the wrong day or maybe.........
We really tried to give L'Atelier de Joël Robuchon benefit of the doubt, but the night we were there, everything was just "A-OK." 
The service was definitely exceptional and professional, the decor was a bit outdated, and the food wasn't great. It was simply "A-OK." The food had beautiful plating. Every dishes were beautiful to look at, but they did not taste as good as they looked. 
Like I said earlier, maybe they had a bad night........
