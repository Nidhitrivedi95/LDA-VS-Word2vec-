cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg foie gras again and again. i made a decision to come back on subsequent visits rather than have to be wheel chaired out or taken to an emergency room after my heart stops from too much foie at once.

didn't have a reservation so arrived a little after 5 pm and asked if they had any availability. seated us right away and we were done in less than 2 hours so they'd have time for their reserved bar seats in time. totally reasonable. 

they hand write their reservations here. crazy!

anyway, ordered the apple, blue cheese and endive salad. great combination and perfect to pair with the heavier foie gras dishes. it was great! (btw whats up with their large utensils).

the duck carpaccio was absolutely amazing.  cheese, mushrooms, chives, raw egg, the works. i would love to have this daily. ugh!! angry it isn't this good in nyc!!!

the foie gras poutin. why not combine two things that are delicious right? ABSOLUTELY!!! would recommend ordering duck fat fries to supplement the remaining gravy and curds after you attack this dish. not salty, but truly flavorful. loved it. this place is truly crushing it!

the desserts in montreal are not my cup of tea (neither is the coffee). but we went deep and got the special sunday for two!! seems like it was made for 5 people though.... maple vanilla ice cream, carmel popcorn, maple breading, maple cotton candy, gold leaf dessert. the chocolate was unnecessary, but the carmel popcorn and maple breaded pieces were good. i probably had two bites. it was not good enough to want to encounter more than a couple bites.

i will however be back for more carpaccio and different foie gras dishes on each subsequent visit. yum!!! definitely the best and not somewhere to pass up!!!
