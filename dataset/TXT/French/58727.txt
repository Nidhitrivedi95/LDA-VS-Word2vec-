RoGeo_pQ1TQc6Lyk4CSDgw A nice place with nice ambiance and good service. However I was a bit disappointed! The food is ok and the prices were not reasonable. Went there with my wife and kids, it is definitely not kids friendly, they have absolutely nothing for kids, we were recommended to order a regular sandwich and make the kids share, not a good idea at all. 
We ordered Ceasar salad, and it wasn't so special. Usually restaurant like Baton Rouge would offer that kind of salad for free. It was not so special at all. 
We ended up paying more that what we got. I would think it is more suitable for people with no kids, there is a bar area and televisions if you want to watch the game.
