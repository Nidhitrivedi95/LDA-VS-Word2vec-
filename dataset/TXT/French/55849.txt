rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Came here to start and end my trip.

They are open for lunch on a weekday, but its a lighter fare. The menu was pretty limited to various soups, salads, and sandwiches. I got the grilled cheese sandwich with tomato bisque soup. The portion was just right and it really hit the spot and filled me up, though probably too small for people with huge appetites.

When I came for brunch a few days later, I had the bouchon french toast and the pomme frites. I really loved the jam they served with the bread. Very fruity and soft and jellylike. The frites order was huge and we couldn't finish it between the 3 of us. We barely made a dent in it before our food was served. The french toast looks small, but it packed a heavy punch because it was soaked with syrup. Mmm.

Service was attentive. I had to dock a star because we waited more than we had to. We went up and asked how much longer and they said they looked for us but couldn't find us (3 table seatings ago). Yeah sure, we were in the sitting area and didn't hear them call us at all.

Great food. Good service. Not the best hosting.
