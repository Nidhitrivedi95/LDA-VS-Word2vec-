cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg C'est le meilleur restaurant de Montréal. It's friendly and relaxed like Canadians. But they cook like the French. So it really is the best of both worlds. 
I got poutine (the best poutine I ever ate in my life) and some super awesome meats. They also suggested an outrageously awesome wine to compliment my meal. 
Love it. Love it. Love it. I'm going back. Someday.
