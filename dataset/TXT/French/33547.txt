hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA Hands down the best French cafe in Vegas ! The owner and staff was very friendly. We tried the chipotle chicken grilled sandwich, moroccan grilled sandwich and the croissant w the egg and for desert we had the cheesecake. All of it was sooo good it's hard to pick a favorite. The baguette and croissant was very fresh and the cheesecake was amazing! It wasn't too sweet very light....We are definitely coming back!
