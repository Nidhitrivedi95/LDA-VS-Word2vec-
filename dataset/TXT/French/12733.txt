4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Strange thing to lead with for a place like this, but they serve the best kid's meal I have ever seen. They brought carrot sticks with dip for our little one to enjoy while we had our appetizer, and then the (awesome) macaroni and cheese came with lovely green beans, very thin apple slices, and extra shredded cheese to sprinkle on top. (See photo). I wish all kids restaurant meals were this nutritious. And all for $5.95. 
Lunch for the adults was also good. Steak tartare was very delicious once we added a sprinkle of salt, and our salads were flavorful and full of quality produce. I really did feel like I was in France on their peaceful patio, rather than steps away from a dark, smoky casino. All the staff was friendly and helpful. A lovely experience all around.
