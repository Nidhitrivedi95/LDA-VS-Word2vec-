_T7f2wUgNlJqxsR-cR89SQ I grew up in Toronto and was back in town to visit as a tourist. Living in San Francisco had set me up with high expectations of fine dining since we have such a wide selection of Michelin star restaurants in our neighborhood. 

The asparagus soup was delicious to start. The scallop appetizer was also on point. We had the lamb and the veal for our mains. I personally enjoyed the lamb dish more and the spicy eggplant relish was great to balance the dish.

Scaramouche definitely delivered that experience I have come to expect in the creativity of the dishes (plating and flavors) as well as service.
