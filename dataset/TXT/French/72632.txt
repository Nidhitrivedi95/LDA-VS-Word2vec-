XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q What a joke. If you are impressed by gold garnish & truffles and think a soft boiled egg for $26 is worthy of the highest rating for a restaurant then this is your place. Everything was good except for the food.  16 course tasting menu, nothing was impressive except the bill. Not worthy of even on Michelin star. I've eaten at better places. The two star Providence in LA should have five stars compared to this place. Jokes on me. Don't waste your time & money. There are better places than this in LV.
