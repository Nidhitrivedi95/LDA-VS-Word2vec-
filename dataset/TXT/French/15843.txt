For some reason, my kids love this place!  So, we eat here or order take out when they insist on it.  Unfortunately, the food quality is just not good enough to put up with the lousy service.
Here's what we experienced on our last 3 visits:
1 - being seated for 15 min before even being acknowledged by our server, ordering drinks and waiting another 20min, 2 of 5 orders were wrong and efforts to correct the deficiencies were ignored
2 - similar to #1 on a different occasion, asking for salad dressing 2x and never receiving it (I had to go get it myself), asking for water refills multiple times, extremely inattentive server (as usual)
3 - ordering curbside takeout only to have to go inside to get order after sitting in car for 15 min (I did curbside b/c I had an ill child and didn't want to expose anyone in the restaurant), when I got inside the order was wrong and took forever to fix (overall checkout for a to go order was 30+ min)
With so many wonderful restaurants in the Scottsdale area, do not waste your time or money on this one!
