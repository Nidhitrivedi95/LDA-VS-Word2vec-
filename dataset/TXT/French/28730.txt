eJ9L40jm5VOXCIq7xs9kQw Just checking out and had a wonderful stay here at the Bonaparte! Room was beautiful and comfortable with hard wood floors, large windows and high ceilings. The bathroom was huge with a large modern shower. The staff was eager to please and pleasant. They have a parking lot across the cobble stone street for an extra $20 a day which was very convenient since parking is tough and a car is absolutely not needed since everything is in walking distance. Highly recommended!
