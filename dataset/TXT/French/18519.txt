aaWhSHpsE285eaSTzDxAMA Went for our first of the monthly vegan meals. The food was great starting with spring rolls and dumplings, followed by Mongolian barbecued tofu with brown rice an veggies, and finished with a chocolate torte that was to die for. Service was friendly and attentive. Atmosphere is bar/pub like, relaxed and clean. Made sure we were on there email list for future vegan meals.
