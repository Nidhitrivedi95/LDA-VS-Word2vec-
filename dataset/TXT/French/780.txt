_cjPEH9wXhKS-HQe_U3M4Q The service here is absolutely trash. They will seat people around you and offer larger groups tables and send small groups to sit at the bar.

The hostess is also extremely dismissive and does not try to fix the situation at all. She offered tables to parties around us and I was only informed that the restaurant was offering tables by another patron.

Food quality is not bad. But not worth me dealing with that type of service as there are tons and tons of comparable restaurants.
