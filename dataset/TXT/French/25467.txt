I'm really sad this place doesn't get more love.  I'm always able to find a seat when I'm here and the last time we visited (earlier this month) there was no one around at all.

I love Mix.  You get to ride in a glass elevator to the (near) top of The Hotel and enjoy an awesome view of Vegas.  Once inside, it's just a chill lounge with lots of seating and a large bar.  They have huge windows to view The Strip, or better yet, you can go outside on their little patio and really soak in the sights.

There's a dj playing some house music at a reasonable level (as in, I can carry on a conversation with my friends) and the atmosphere is nice and relaxed.  It's the perfect place to bring friends, have a date, or even take family.

I especially love the bathrooms- a room with black floors and walls, a black toilet, a floor-to-ceiling window overlooking Mandalay and the pool, and no outside lights other than the ones making up the Mandalay signs.  It definitely threw me for a loop the first time I came to Mix.

I'm not sure why this place is so slow.... I don't know if they aren't advertising enough and no one knows about it, or if it's because it's a little tricky to find, or because the fact that it's not a club so all the 20-somethings want to party elsewhere....  I really don't get it.

I ALWAYS take friends and family who are in town to Mix, and they are always impressed.  

Located in The Hotel near the Mandalay Theater entrance.  There was no cover charge when I last went.  Drinks are very overpriced, but that is pretty standard on The Strip.
