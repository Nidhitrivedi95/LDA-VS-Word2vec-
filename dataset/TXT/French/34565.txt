HojKatUfX4UHWaPqtl63NQ Awesome dinner with incredible view. 
The servers and his assistant, the sommelier and all the staff was extremely kind and well polished. 
We really enjoyed the black olive tapenade to start dinner. 
Loved the all chickpeas variations, as well as the octopus appetizer. 
Also loved the black truffle linguinis and lobster risoto. 
The ending could have not been better than finishing with a wonderful array of sorbets as well a delightful chocolate souffle. 

Cannot wait to go back for another incredible experience.
