atNpoWy_XrhT9EUIEP6azg I have been wanting to try this place for a while now and finally had the perfect excuse. The lovely patio made the perfect setting for a reunion brunch with old friends from out of town! A great wine list and awesomely spicy bloody mary's set us off on the right foot. We had to try the tempura-fried bacon with bourbon maple syrup... a friend's review had the batter as too thick, but a solid effort. However, I think it was perfect; had the whole doughnut appeal with the salty bacon surprise in the middle!

To counteract the fat intake, I ordered the salmon fume' (smoked salmon, cooked egg, shallots, cured lemon, caviar). Everything arrived in individual little piles on a wooden platter so anyone squeamish about any ingredients could just avoid them altogether. I, on the other hand, polished off every bite. It was all very fresh and light with great flavor.

The friends all really enjoyed their meals and I got kudos a-plenty for suggesting such a great place to meet. Even the toddler gave rave reviews, eating almost the entire plate of sour cream-hazelnut waffles with warm berry compote... he had the berry stains everywhere to prove it!
