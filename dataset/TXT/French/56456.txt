rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I like this place because the ingredients are different. I didn't really care for any of the waffles or french toast. I thought it was a bit tart & weird. The chicken with the waffles was delicious though. Very flavorful. My Strawberry Fields was sparkly & wonderful in my mouth. The little tiny dried strawberries were divine. If you are looking for a fruity cocktail, then don't order any of their drinks. I got the Croque Madam & it was pretty good. It was like a grilled ham & cheese with a poached egg. I thought it was an unusual addition by Thomas Keller since the sandwich is usually considered a peasant food. I also enjoyed their rasberry beignet. DO NOT PASS THAT UP!! People say the orange juice is amazing & I do not why. It's a orange that's been squeezed. Great job Mr. Keller. Maybe one day I will be able to afford some of your other restaurant.
