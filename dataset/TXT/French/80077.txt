zw4Legbcu018p5WcZ74iWA Went here for breakfast for the second time and was introduced to PP's significant poutine. I mean, the breakfast was amazing, and the poutine was a contender, for sure. Patati Patata's just made some big-time friends.

My recommendation for breakfast, get the omelette. Or the crepes, both are great. The only thing is, if you get the omelette, you get their delicious black bean stuff and home fries alongside. For lunch and dinner, the poutine is a must, and the sliders won't disappoint.
