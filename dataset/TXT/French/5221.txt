3FlWR_osNPb8dcqLgHebHw This place is fantastic!  I actually first learned about Mimi's after going to the location out in Henderson, but this locaiton has been my choice ever since.  

Food is great, service is outstanding!  I've actually never been for breakfast, and after reading reviews of some of my fellow Yelpers, I will have to do just that next time around.

This is one of the places that I bring "non-locals" for something different.

They are opening another location, off of Rainbow and 215.  Being my part of town, this makes me very excited!
