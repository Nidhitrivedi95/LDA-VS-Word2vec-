Mqsb3Tzabaq95yQIWTuQtg I had walked passed The Wild Elephant everyday when I was in first year going to my classes and I always intended to go in as I love Thai food, but it took me till my second year to actually step foot in the restaurant. The inside decor of the restaurant looks very 1970's and it is covered in elephants and you could easily be mistaken for thinking you were actually in Thailand. The staff were incredibly inviting and attentive and there was an excellent selection of dishes on their menu, with a great veggie section too.

I chose dishes which were house specialities and I had the chicken in Thai Green Curry which was gorgeous and my friend had the tempura which she adored as well. The portions were a decent size and I thought the dishes were reasonably priced for what they were.  I saw other customers in the restaurant bringing in their own bottles of wine which would definitely be a cheaper option than ordering the restaurant's wine. The White Elephant is definitely worth a look.
