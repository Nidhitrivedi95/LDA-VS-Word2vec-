SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ My husband and I came in for phoenix restaurant week and it was delicious. The ambience, quality of the food, and service justify the prices and we were very happy.

My husband enjoyed the cocktails and they brought me a really ginger beer which I appreciated (I'm pregnant no cocktails for me).

I really enjoyed eating here and we will be back!!
