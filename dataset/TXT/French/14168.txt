58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw There was a decent line for Saturday brunch but we did not wind up waiting too long, about 30 minutes. I would describe the locale as trendy. The maple syrup coffee was top notch however I can't stand overcooked scrambled eggs. The waiter at first brought out the wrong order which he self-corrected ten minutes later. The amuse bouche was a nice starter, it was bread pudding, the portion sizes were good but overall I was disappointed.
