eJ9L40jm5VOXCIq7xs9kQw While I didn't hit up the restaurant portion, my girlfriend and I did stay for a weekend (circa November 2006) at the inn due to a recommendation from a friend who had lived in Montreal for a bit. The inn can definitely be described as a place for older couples. We were definitely the youngest ones around, which didn't bother us at all but might have bothered others around us. We weren't going to be loud or obnoxious, so please, stop giving us dirty looks.

Perfectly situated in the older section of Montreal, the inn is within walking distance of many of the sites within old Montreal. We were also able to easily access any place outside of the older section while never being that far away from our hotel. 

More on the actual inn.

We went during the off season (November) and spend $165/ night for the most basic room; a room with a queen sized bed and a complete bathroom. The room had views of a cathedral and its gardens, which probably would have been beautiful in the spring, but was not very impressive in the fall (obviously not the fault of the garden). Now, I'm not really accustomed to nice hotels, so I was quite impressed with the elegant hardwood floors, the wall sconce equipped with dimmers, the comfortable bed, the clean bathroom...etc etc. Perhaps I'm not the best one to say this, but it's definitely one of the nicest hotel rooms I have ever had the pleasure of staying in. Breakfast the next morning was excellent, if a bit less filling than my usual morning meal.  Overall, the vibe was cozy, classy, intertwined with a bit of old school charm.
