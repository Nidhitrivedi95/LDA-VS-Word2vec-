mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q Stopped in for a light supper before seeing Ka.  We got sat right away without a reservation.  
The few dishes we had were amazing! 
This is not for the bargain buffet binge eater but for people that love food and want quality over quantity.  
The service was friendly and I love that you can eat while watching the chefs carefully prepare the food.
