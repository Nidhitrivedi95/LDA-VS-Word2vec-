rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A My friend was very excited to come here for brunch before we left Vegas and I could not remember having been here before until we walked into the restaurant. This sets the tone for the rest of the experience...because it wasn't memorable...and this time was no different. We ordered brunch...she had the pancakes which she did not even finish eating and I had an omelette as you can see from my pic. My friend seemed more excited about eating here then the actual food! The omelette was good but not worth the price of eating here. I do appreciate their bread knots but again not enough to come back here again. Service was good and dress ranged from dressy to super casual--like bathing suits.  Maybe I am missing something...the place is nice...I am clearly unsure what the hype is about.
