SBnpT6JDbah-5l_52GM5sw I was happily taken to Sardine for brunch today (Saturday) in which I was in rare form after a night out. We sat out on the pleasant terrace by the lake and it felt like a relaxed, welcoming place even though I couldn't bear to take off my sunglasses. 
I ordered the Belgian waffle and my boyfriend had the duck confit salad. I love a warm salad, and this was right up-to-par with it's cooked egg on top. My waffle had cinnamon stewed apples, REAL maple syrup, and some sort of fluffy butter concoction on top. The waffle had a bit of crispness to it, which I liked, and it was rectangular, as if done in an old-school waffle iron-griddle. Excellent! Just what the doctor ordered! 
I know that my boyfriend was also thrilled that the well-made bloody mary came with a stella artois chaser... 
The service was friendly and the prices were soooo reasonable for what we had. I've only been there for brunch so can't quote on the rest, but next time I"m in Madison I will definitely be checking out Sardine again!
