6fPQJq4f_yiq1NHn0fd11Q I was walking back to my room in the Paris mall this past weekend while I was in vegas and ended up passing by this place. Even though I was super tired at 6:15 A.M. and wanted my bed at that point I decided to stop at this place. at that point they were getting ready and stated that they would open at 7. So I decided to go back and gamble until 7 A.M. since I was really hungry. (I do not recommend you continuing gambling once you have decided to stop haha). Once I get back at 7 they stated that still needed another 10 minutes to open. So I waited. Even though I was the second person in line it took 20 minutes for them to make two crepes which I though was more then it should've taken. I got the Nutella banana fosters crepe which was absolutely amazing! I would defenitly get it again next time if I stay at Paris. The reason for the 4 stars is due to the amount of time it took to make two crepes and them not opening when they promised it would be open.
