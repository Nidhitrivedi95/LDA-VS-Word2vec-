KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA We used to come here for Moules Frites, the view and fantastic music. The view and music are still there but the food....Huge disappointment. We ordered Escargot to start, I had Prince Edward Island mussels with a side of garlic fryers and husband had Seared duck in honey and spice glaze for our mains. The warm bread with whipped butter was divine as usual. Garlic herb butter the escargot were clocked in was very nice but one of the snails came with sand:( at this point we were still quite happy, enjoying a bottle of Rombauer Chardonnay, bread and our starter. Then the mains arrived. What a disappointment! The mussels were overlooked, the sauce was super salty, the fries probably were the worst fries I have ever had. They seemed to have been lightly battered to increase crispness but instead of tasting of garlic and herbs the flavor was slightly reminiscent of chicken fingers. Needless to say I put it away after two bites. The duck, while prepared in a very flavorful sauce, was undercooked and quite fatty. The waiter noticed that I was not eating and commented that the restaurant had changed chefs not that long ago. We were offered a complimentary crime brûlée which I must say was perfect but no one offered to take my my barely touched food off the bill ( we didn't expect it but it definitely would have bean a good will gesture prompting us to give the restaurant another try). I give two stars because we had great service ( I can't blame the server for not offering to take uneaten food off the bill, clearly manager's fault ), beautiful view, amazing acoustic guitarist, wonderful warm bread and delicious desert. Unfortunately, this was our last visit to Marche Bacchus:((((
