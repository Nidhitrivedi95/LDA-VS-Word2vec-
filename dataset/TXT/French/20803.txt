AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw I give this place more of a 3.5 stars. It's pricey but good! We got a bunch of pastries to go so we could hit the road & avoid traffic heading home.

The place was packed on a Sunday morning and the wait was a tad long but the ladies working the crepe station, the pastry station, and the coffee station were all hustling as fast as they could.

I ordered a bunch of pastries for the whole group:

-Almond croissant
-Cheese Danish
-Blueberry muffin
-Chocolate chip muffin

They all looked good! I didn't try everything but nibbled on some of my family's pastries and then had the almond croissant which was nice and flaky. 

I did get a hot soy latte to go with my pastry and it was good!

I also got some Rochers to go as gifts for people and also bought one for our family. They are good!!! There's one canister that comes with white, milk, and dark chocolate. I still might prefer a ferrero rocher due to the hazelnut spread (nutella makes everything tastier) but I'd still say the rochers were worth trying.
