AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw Everything is expensive in Las Vegas. It's a given.  I shelled out $10/6 macaroons.  

The pear dessert was to die for $7/slice. I shared it with my dad.  The iced coffee (we got a large) and shared it too.  

I was hoping it would be semi away from the distracting slot machines but it wasn't really.
