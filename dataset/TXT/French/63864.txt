T4g4k2OhCTsiqcP-ZXElHQ This restaurant is just as cute as can be. Such a great place for an affordable date night or a casual dinner with friends. Their prix fixe menu is a steal and I can't recommend it enough! Oh and the service is phenomenal, the sweet girl laughed at all our dumb jokes and was so helpful along the way.

The steak frites was delicious, each fry was crisp and just the perfect size. I found the steak a bit thin and on the chewy side, but it was still really well seasoned and thoroughly enjoyable. The starters on the set menu (salads and soup) were all pretty forgettable, but that creme brulee was delicious. I also tried a bit of the veal chop special and the salmon and both were very tasty! 

All in all I had a blast--such a lovely atmosphere with great food and friendly service. I'll definitely be back. 


Pro Tip: Bringing a cake for a friend's birthday? There's a small fee per person. ($2.50 I believe)
