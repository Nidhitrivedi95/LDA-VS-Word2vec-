zw4Legbcu018p5WcZ74iWA One of my only disappointing meals while in Montreal. Stopped in around midnight and had a friendly guy help me interpret the French menu. I decided on a burger and poutine under the guise that it was $6.50. My French sucks so I apparently misunderstood the guy/menu and my bill ended up being like $9 instead.

That wouldn't have been so bad if I a) got good service, b) liked my meal, or c) got what I ordered. 

The guy couldn't come out from behind the counter so I had to clean my own table since he couldn't reach.  Another no biggie but added to the experience. 

Got my burger first (and it was made waaaay after I ordered it) and it was just ok.  The poutine came next and it was not the one with the vegetables I asked for. But I didn't want to make a fuss. It was also just ok. 

I had to pretty much beg a worker to take my money as he was focused on other people. In fairness, he apologized for the price misunderstanding. But it was just overall a meh experience. I can't imagine I'll be back with so many other options in the area.
