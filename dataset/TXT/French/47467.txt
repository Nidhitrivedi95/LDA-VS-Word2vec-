O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q We had brunch at Morels French Steakhouse and Bistro while staying at the Palazzo Hotel in Las Vegas.  We enjoyed the food and view while eating brunch out on the patio .  The skirt steak and eggs were very tasty.  The steak was seasoned just perfectly!  They did forget to give us our Pommes Fries with both orders but they comp us our beverages for their mistake and took $10 bucks off the bill.  The coffee was very fresh and they had a good selection to choose from.  I also liked the large variety of cheeses on their cheese menu.  It was excellent cheese.  Overall the the service was good.
