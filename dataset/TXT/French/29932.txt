fKDyiIcFLkl-_5d4JsvBXA Our 2nd dinner in this well known place. Above average piece of meat, without being at the top level. At least, you can get it blue, not that easy in North America. Being with good friends helped us waiting forever to get served. 2 hours for a dinner, sounds unusual here. The Brouilly was of great value.
