4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw The wait was not bad compared to most other restaurants on a Friday night.  I had a show to get to at 10 pm, and the waiter was great about getting my order in and me out of there in time.

French onion soup: ooey, gooey, and cheesey! So good with the fresh bread they give you.
Pate: fresh and worth the price for an appetizer
Seafood platter: FRESH seafood, but deceiving.  It's worth the price because the quality is great, but it isn't a ton of food.
