SPLURGING time!  Happy Anniversary to us.  In Vegas, most couples want to gamble, party, drink....all we wanted  was some FOIE GRAS.  We decided to treat ourselves to our very first Michelin rated restaurant, owned by Chef of the Century, Joel Robuchon.  This location is more casual and affordable than The Mansion next door (Michelin 3 star). I'd say try this first, then work your way up! 
My senses were beaming in this fine establishment!

SEE: A red & black motif.  Great view of the kitchen with COUNTER seating. Watch your chef cook & construct your plates ever so delicately.  A show in itself.  Eye catching food presentation!  Chef Steve Benjamin was spotted greeting some frequents. 

FEEL:  Love is in the air. Couldnt help but feel blessed and spoiled.
Counter seats weren't the most comfy. Especially, since most ladies had dresses and heels on.  A hint of snootiness in the air too. 

HEAR: Humbling sound of pots and pans clonking & clanging in the kitchen. Chiming wine glasses/bottles and "ting ting" from our silverware.  Waiters giving detailed description of the menu/dishes.  A relaxing ambiance with personal conversations and laughter.  

SMELL:  Butter, garlic, grilling, citrus....a plethora of sweet, nutty and rich aroma.    

TASTE:  The Seasonal Discovery Tasting Menu  (9 dishes) w/ pairing ($165 + $105) for the hubs.  My initial plan was to try 2-3 recommended appetizers.  But, the portion size sounded so small and I was starving.  So, I opted for their MENU A option ($78). I admit, I was going for quantity, since I wasn't too excited about my options.  I ended up paying an extra $10 for two of their upgraded options.   

**HIGHLIGHTS from Seasonal Discovery Menu**
-La Saint-Jacques: scallop carpaccio on the shell w/ lemon vinaigrette: fresh, light and fragrant. Nice starter. 
-Le Foie Gras:  OMG!  This by far was their best dish.  Imagine a savory chicken broth flan/custard with duck foie gras.  A great balance of light texture w/ rich flavors.  Delicious!  Different from anything I've ever tasted.  OUR FAVE. 
-La Caille:  caramelized free range quail stuffed with foie gras. Holy cow.   It came with the creamiest mashed  potatoes EVER.  Delicious. 

**HIGHLIGHTS from  dishes I selected for Menu A**
-Amuse-Bouche:  Custard foie gras w/ parmesean  foam.  Mmm...mmm good. INSTANT GRATIFICATION.  
-La Dorade:  snapper carpaccio w/ lemon vinaigrette. Very similar to the scallop carpaccio, but had a bolder flavor. This was better!   
-Les Tartes:  With a very generic description, this option sounded boring at first.  I am SO HAPPY I chose it. Pastry Chef Salvatore Martone definitely delivered.  With 5 completely different tarts to sample, I was in heaven.  The crusts  were light and buttery.  They each had their featured ingredients ranging from pistachio, peanuts, chocolate and pineapple cream cheese. PINEAPPLE CHEESECAKE was my FAVE; by far the lightest and most fragrant cheesecake you will ever taste.    

NOT A FAN:  
-Le Veau: veal ravioli (additional $10): It was good, but nothing special. 
-Les Pates: spiced Main lobster over orecchiette pasta (additional $10): a good amount of fresh lobster chunks. Lobster was seasoned well and cooked just right; had a nice bite to it. 
**I love pasta and usually gravitate towards these dishes.  But, I need to remember that I am in a French restaurant.  Gotta Stick to my gut and order what the French are famous for.  Both pastas were too al dente for me.  Sad to say, it wasn't anything special.**

SERVICE: Very proper and courteous.  We were lucky to receive a complimentary chocolate soufflé w/ "happy anniversary" fired on the chocolate piece. SWEET!  Our waiter forgot hubby's last wine and felt horrible about it.  We ended up w/ 3 dessert wines.  Haha!  

We had a fantastic time and were stuffed beyond belief.  The culprit: THE assortment of BREAD!   I fell in love w/ their buttery croissant like bread and butter.  Very noteworthy part of my night 

TID BITS: 
1) Located in MGM Grand Hotel near the KA theater.  
2) Dress however you want. It's Vegas.  Most ladies were in dresses and men in collared shirts (short/long).  
3) Not kid friendly
4) Make a reservation.
