4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Great food & service. Def coming back.

Came the day before Thanksgiving for lunch. Seated right away in the solarium.

Waitress was very attentive & knows the menu well. It's my pet peeve when servers don't know about the menu. Our waitress knew the 4 types of mushrooms in the side dish.

6" bowl of cappuccino - $7. Great value and yum.

Steak sandwich - $15. Steak encased in the middle of a long baguette shape bread, juicy & flavorful. Came with thin strips of fries, like the shape of tortilla strips, crunchy.

Maine lobster roll - $19.  Came with light refreshing baby frisee (curly endive) salad and fries. I didn't want fries so I got sautéed mushrooms (oyster, shiitake, crimini, hen if the woods), super yum.  The roll is filled with tons of lobster meat, not just claw but also lots tail meat, fantastic.

Each table gets a soft long baguette & hard butter.

Everything came out quickly. Really great experience. Highly recommended.
