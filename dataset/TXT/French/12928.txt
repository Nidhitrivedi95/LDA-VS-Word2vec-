4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Great place, for starter we took the hot goat cheese swimming in great tomato sauce.
Kids took pasta dishes, which were flavored and fancy relative to its price.
For main, we took the vegi  Cencioni which was surprisingly good, with lemon and light butter flavor with shallots and French beans, great dish to have.
I took 1/2 mussels portion, which was big and good lemon flavor. We coupled dinner with 2 cups of fence wine which made the whole dinner better even w 3 kids w us...
