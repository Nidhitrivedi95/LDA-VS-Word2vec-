rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w Super impressed!!  Very rich dinner.  Everything made with butter I think. Lol Brought my fiancé here for his birthday.  At first they said they were all booked up and could not book our reservation but the hostess was super nice and got us in.
The service was almost great.  The bread guy and the bald American white guy were super friendly, but the French guy not so much.
We ordered the 5 course menu and holy ish it was good.  My personal favorites was the burgundy escargot, risotto with morels, and the braised beef cheek covered in shaved black truffle.  My fiancé ordered scallops with a coconut curry and... damn.  So good!
This dinner was expensive but when you only fine done twice a year it's ok... and this one was worth it.
