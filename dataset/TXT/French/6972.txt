4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I'm not sure who our waitress was, but she was awesome, made the meal that much better! Seafood platter was the main dish, salmon tartar was exceptional. Also I got a ginger vodka cocktail that was AWESOME. No complaints here, French onion soup was good...most are toooo salty --good food, good service, awesome atmosphere!
