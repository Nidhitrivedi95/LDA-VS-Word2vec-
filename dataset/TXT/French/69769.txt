WOd8tWsh2Yt_osHv-ngx_w I ate a decent bacon Benny at this funky little breakfast spot today. I came in at 11:30 there was plenty of seating, friendly server and my food was good and served quickly, shockingly so. The food reminded me of Cora but the atmosphere was much more upscale. I'm a self proclaimed Benny connoisseur, so I can't give it five stars, but it was good, and I was hungry. Hollandaise is not 'classic' but it fit the bill.
