rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Great French food in an amazing atmosphere, all for under $100 for two people! I had never been to the 10th floor in the Venetian, where the restaurant is located. Quite an awe inspiring hallway there, with very beautiful architecture. The restaurant is right off the elevator. The steak and frites were excellent!!
