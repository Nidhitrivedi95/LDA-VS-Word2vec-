xcmmTXhuMx2fZF2Bt69F4w Woah this has got to be my new favorite brunch place in Pittsburgh. Me and my friend came here for a Sunday brunch and we waited for 15 min, which is not bad at all. I ordered two entrees because I'm a fatty. (Don't judge :-p) I ordered the crab cake Benedict and the waffle with chocolate sauce. They both came with fruit on the side. For the waffle, in addition to the fruit pieces, there is also a bowl of seasonal fruit, which is spice Apple in this case. Geez. I am in love. Both of the entrees are so tasty! The Benedict was made so perfectly, I can eat it every day. The waffle mmmm I didn't expect that much out of it, but dang! It is so yummy. My friend she got the Canadian eggs Benedict and she was really happy with her choice. This place is a solid five star for sure! If you haven't tried it yet, I suggest you to do so soon ;) mmmhmm I gotta come back here for dinner and see their regular food is like. I will be sure to update my review when I do!
