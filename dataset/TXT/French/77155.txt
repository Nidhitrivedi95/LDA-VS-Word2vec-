YUFxSG6idHePsxOmnSHtpQ At some point you have to ask yourself if going out to a $30 breakfast (for 2) is better than just staying home and scrambling your own eggs.  I have to say that this was one of those that I should have just stayed home.
Woke up late this Sunday and the wife and I decided to go in search of breakfast.  After passing up a few of our regular options? We decided to give Mimi's a try.  We were seated promptly and the server was right over to take our drink order.  The coffee was good. We placed our order and then waited.
15 minutes later we watched 2 servers carry out food all over the dining room searching for the right table. They found us after someone else came over and pointed them in the right direction.
My entire breakfast was cold. My wife's was hot. Not sure how that happened. Meanwhile my coffee cup is empty and there is no server to be found. If a manager had checked on us I would have sent my breakfast back. The waitress finally delivers more coffee and the check. We just started eating and she brings me the check!? I suppose we need to get out. My wife and I left 3/4 of the breakfast untouched and then tried to pay the check. After 15 minutes the server comes back for the check. (Apparently they didn't want us to leave too quickly.) I probably should have said something but the waitress should have seen that we hardly ate anything. 
Oh well. No need to return. This place is not worth it.
