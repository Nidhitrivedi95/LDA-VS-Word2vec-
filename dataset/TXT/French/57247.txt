rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Visited for dinner on a Sunday evening, July 8, 2012 (sorry, long overdue review!)

I expected to be wow'd a little more, having high expectations of Thomas Keller, my favorite chef if I had to pick one.  But, I think he dropped the ball on this location.

I really had to examine the pics I took to refresh my memory of that dinner, as it was not very memorable.  Let me start with the good:

- a chef friend loved the puff pastry escargot

Shit, I'm at a loss! I just sat for a good 5 minutes scrolling back through pics to put something good down about that dinner, avoiding the obvious "in good company" (we were celebrating a friend's bachelor party that weekend, so in high spirits).  But I really was unimpressed.

The carpeting seemed drab, though the lighting was a warm yellow glow.  I got sleepy just looking at the pics of dinner.  I am careful not to say romantic though, cause it didn't feel that way to me... more like "old."  Yea, if I was 62 and wanted to enjoy a quiet, civilized dinner with my wife, this is the spot.  Until then, I think I'll stick to hip trendy spots filled with girls in short skirts spilling out of their top.  Oh God, I need to return to Vegas soon.
