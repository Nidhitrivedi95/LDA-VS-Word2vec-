SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA Sweet Jesus, this is an awesome place. While I am generally the type who feels way more comfortable in dives than in swanky places, I gotta say that the meal I had at this place was pretty damn near impeccable. It was a family get-together, so there were about 15 of us, but our reservation said as much and they were ready when we got there on a busy Saturday night. For one, the service at this place was really astounding. They were there to refill drinks (and even the cheapos like me drinking water) and the like constantly. 

But of course service only goes so far -- at a restaurant, it's all about the food (duh). And boy does this place deliver. I only got the house burger with a salad, but even that was probably one of the best burgers I've ever had, much more rich and delicious than your usual restaurant fare. Everyone at my table ordered something different, so I can also say that (at least bites) of the roasted cod and pork two ways were phenomenal. And, for what you get, the prices are absolutely reasonable for this level of fine dining. I will definitely be back.
