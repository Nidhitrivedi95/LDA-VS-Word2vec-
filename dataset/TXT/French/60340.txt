SBnpT6JDbah-5l_52GM5sw I finally came to Sardine for dinner- and it blew my mind! Lived up to everything I thought it would be and more. 

we ate:

appetizers:
-fried smelt (I am not a fish lover-- but the people who love smelt, loved this dish!)
-sardine caesar salad: YUM
-roasted beet and carrot salad: YUM YUM

mains (don't laugh that we got pasta at a french place...):
-penne: too full to eat- but ate the next day and so flavorful! loved everybite! the sauce is delicate and compliments the dish so well
-House-made cavatelli: phenomenol! if you love mushrooms- look no further
-Sardine burger (which I saw on the bar menu-- so amazing with fig aioli on it. WOW! mind-blowing) even better than the brunch burger

Dessert:
-pumpkin bread pudding (so light and delish!)

We *heart* sardine
