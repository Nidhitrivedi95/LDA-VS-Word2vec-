gf46U12A1oIIpq2sNt_PGg Our first visit was a pleasant one.  It was a Monday evening and a bit busier then they expected, so initial service was slow.  Their wine selection is amazing for such a small neighbourhood restaurant. The waiter/sommelier in training was a great surprise and he found us the perfect choices with our food - not exactly a wine paring but great for such an intimate place.  The escargot in a red wine reduction is not to be missed if it is on the menu.  THeir menus change seasonally.  Extremely well priced for the neighbourhood.  Mains under $20 which was a pleasant surprise. We'll stop in again just to see what the chef as created
