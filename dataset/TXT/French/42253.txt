l09JfMeQ6ynYs5MCJtrcmQ My boyfriend and I were contact through Yelp and offered free entrées on account of our previous experience at Alize (see below). At the end of our meal we were surprised when they took care of our entire bill (all $110 of it!) We also identified ourselves when we made our reservations so they knew it was us from the start.

I think it is extremely commendable that the restaurant offered to make up for a previous experience. Most just wouldn't care.

With that disclaimer in mind: 

The service during this visit was impeccable. Despite the fact the restaurant was packed when we arrived we were greeted and seated right away. Throughout the evening we always felt like the most important guests in the restaurant with our food arriving quickly and our servers being careful to make sure we had everything we needed. 

The food is very simple and elegant. The ingredients are fresh. The menu is everything you'd expect from a nice Italian restaurant. My only advice would be to skip the Caesar salad, the other salads on the menu are much better.

While we ate our meal we watched Mariam, the owner, making the rounds of the restaurant making sure every table was happy with their experience. She is clearly passionate about what she does and has a real heart for her customers and her business. We couldn't help but overhear a truly genuine conversation between the couple next to us celebrating their 50th anniversary and Mariam. They were telling her how Alize is their favourite restaurant in the area. 

I'm giving this an honest 3 star review because for me, this isn't my ideal restaurant. I like restaurants that are a little darker, a little noisier, and foods that are a little more off beat and provide a 'wow' factor. 

This place will be lovely in the summer on the patio or even inside since they can open the front right up to let the warm summer breeze blow through.

Alize, thank you for a wonderful evening.
