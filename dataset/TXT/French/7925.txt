4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Honestly nothing special, food was okay but over priced like everything else on the strip.
Service was good in the beginning the upsetting after the brought our food but did bring butter or jam, we asked politely but it still took another 5 mins to get.
My Ham and Cheese omelet was decent but nothing special and my wife Eggs with Hash was seen in much cheaper less fancy establishments.
