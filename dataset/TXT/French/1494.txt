0anXSUX9KG5sQEzs-Of8Vg When i first moved to Verdun (i don't live there anymore), this was one of the first restaurant that i've been to. I fell in love! The owners are SUPER friendly. The husband in the kitchen and the wife in the front of the house. They make you feel like you are part of the family and you do feel that way.

The food...it has this homemade comforting soul food style to it. It's like going to an aunt's house for dinner. The price is more then reasonable. You can eat well for around 20$ per person. When you order a main, it automatically comes with a portion of deliciously crispy fried cabbage and a soup. Appetizers are about 4-5$. My favourite would be the fried coconut shrimp appetizer, fish and shrimp dish or the lamb shank. It comes with salad and rice. The main dishes are around 15$, give or take. I NEVER finish my plate! That's how big the portions are. 

I would once in awhile drive all the way there just for the food. Plus, they always recognizes their regulars. Even after a year abroad on hiatus like me ;)

IT'S BYOB!!!
