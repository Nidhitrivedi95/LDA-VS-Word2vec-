4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Pros: The seafood platter was very fresh, especially the oysters! The sauces on everything was delicious! The scallops were very well prepared.

Cons: Besides the small portions, the actual steaks themselves were not that amazing. Not very tender or juicy. In addition, they give you a giant stack of fries to cover up for the fact that they give you very little entree. This leads me to say that the quality of food low for the price. 

Overall: Touristy and nice =P
