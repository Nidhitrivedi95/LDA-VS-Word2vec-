I've been here twice, the first time I had the Union Salad (pretty good) & Sticky Ginger cake (divine - must try).
The second time, we ducked inside to escape a downpour & stayed for dinner. My husband had the Steak Hache (v. good) I tried the sticky ribs and they were fall-off-the-bone, burned in my epicurean heart deliciousness. Fries are perfect also.

Can't wait to go back.
