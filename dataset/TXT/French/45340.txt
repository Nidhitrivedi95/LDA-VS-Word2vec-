mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q What a horrible waste of $570 for a two person meal.  I have no problem dropping that much for a special meal, but I expect it to be of higher quality than at least a TGI Friday's or Chili's (which are of course much simpler and have lower cost ingredients, but on net and in all seriousness I sadly would have enjoyed more).

The fish for both of us was so overcooked (_well_ beyond well done) I was shocked. We showed ours to the waiter and he was embarrassed/agreed and offered to have the chef try again -- though we had to go to a show after so couldn't wait for them to redo them. Most of the other ~7 or so dishes on the tasting menu were either extremely bland or had mismatching ingredients that clashed instead of complemented each other--the kind of rookie chef mistakes you expect from a $20-30 entree place.  My wife and I both didn't even finish dessert, and I for one am typically a huge dessert fan. This was literally the worst value for the money (and one of my bottom 10 regardless of price) restaurant meals of all time. Joel Robuchon should be ashamed.  I want my money, and my three hours, back.
