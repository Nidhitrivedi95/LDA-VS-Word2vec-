u-SvRRAfYgpbXZRfQgcTzA The 5-star is based on the assumptions that 
1) you are down for a REAL Nihon-bar night experience, which means
2) you are tolerant of LOUD people, and cute(and/or hot) Asian girls in short uniform skirts running around who might miss orders sometimes

I'm down for both so I gave it a 5*

First of all, the food is, IMO, very close to what Japan has to offer. 
Make sure you order Karrage, and Okonomiyaki. They are Delish! 
- Okonomiyaki is this Japanese pancake made from eggs, shredded cabages, Dashi(Japanese cooking broth), meat (as far as I remember u get the option of octopus, squid or chicken), with the following topping - zigzagging Mayo, green onions and bonito  (some kind of fish) flakes flying on top. the presentation and the taste is definitely A+. 
- the Karrage I ordered was this deep-fried chicken pre-marinated in, probably soy sauce and garlic, with flour coating. I ate it with this garlic, soysauce dipping. hmm,hmm, tastay~ 
- I also ordered the pork-belly noodle soup. It's light but tasty to my taste buds, but some people might consider it bland.  

Second, make sure you go there for dinner on weekends; Once I went for lunch, only to find out they are only open for dinner on weekends. 

Something worth noticing of this place is: late at night, you might see a group of people doing shots, where they place little shots glass gently on top of two chopsticks that are stacked on top of some bigger beer mugs. The seismic wave created by either hitting the table, or probably just people yelling/cheering drop the shots glass into the beer mugs. This might explain why this place gets very loud sometimes.  

Decor is all simplistic, industrial style, high ceiling with a lot of wood elements (which I appreciate a lot), Utensils and dishwares seem to be authentic Japanese style. 

Last but NOT least, brace yourself for the chorus of greetings when you arrive and when you leave. Home-run for Imadake!
