4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw My friends & I came to Vegas to reunite & celebrate our five years of friendship that began in France.  Well, what better place to celebrate than a French cafe.  We went for lunch and enjoyed our quiche lorraines, French bread, and waters.  The spinach on the side was to die for.  Service was great.  We were a bit dehydrated from our flights & going out the night before and were chugging the water.  Our waiter must have filled each of our glasses 5-6 times.
