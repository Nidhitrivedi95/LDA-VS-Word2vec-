uP3H5bcsiTXM0k0xQhRndg US California review here!

What a great little dinner spot! The waitress was very chatty. She told us the place will be relocated with an actual kitchen with w a deep fryer. It's amazing what they can do without one right now! I will definitely look forward to the new spot and expanded menu when I return to Montreal. 

The place is a good size. They have space to seat a party of 10 so if you have a big party, no worries. I would be safe and call first to see how busy they are. 

Their menu is simple. One pager. Several appetizers and three main entrees. My wife and I skipped the appetizer and ordered their signature Mac N Cheese and their pork belly. This was way more than enough food for the two of us. 

Their Mac N Cheese was good but I wasn't a fan of the sweet ham. Your taste buds may differ. The pork belly is a must try. It was so tender and delicious. We were very satisfied.
