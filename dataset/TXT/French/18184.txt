Came here to pick up some goodies for my Mom's birthday.  They had some amazing looking truffle choco cakes for about $30, but when I saw I could get HUGE slices of the same thing for only $4, I decided to get 5-6 different things for the same money!  

We tried a bunch of things, but the truffle choco cake was probably my favorite.  I tried the macaroons, and they were good too...kinda fluffy and not overly sweet.  I also liked the profiteroles, so I would recommend any of those!

The tiramisu wasn't the best I've had, but it was good.  I prob would skip it next time though.

But seriously, if you are in the neighborhood, this is a great way to fix your sweet tooth for very reasonable money!  One $4 slice by myself woulda topped me off personally :)
