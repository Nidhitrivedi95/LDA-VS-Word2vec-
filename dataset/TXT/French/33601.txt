hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA First time, I had a couple sandwiches there to try, I thought they were ok but wanted to come back and try breakfast items. At the time, my parents were in town and I thought this would be perfect place to take them out for breakfast. I love how cozy this place is and super friendly owner! 

I had the breakfast combo which was egg omelet bacon panini, OJ and coffee. My dad had croissant and large coffee, mom had a huge portion of curry chicken quiche that she couldn't finish (my mom is tiny person, 4'9" and 80 lbs! but she loves to eat, wonder where I get that from!) so we all shared our food, of course. The panini was not too bad, probably would order something else next time. Croissant, fresh out of oven, was delicious. Curry chicken quiche.. yummy! Seasoning was right on spot. 

The pricing for all of us was under $16 I believe. My dad originally wanted to eat at one of those buffet on the strip and it was $15 per person for breakfast (but meh, I'm not a fan of buffets). Glad I took them to this place instead, my parents were pleased!
