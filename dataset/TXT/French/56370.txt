rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Came here for my (first) birthday dinner.  I would give them another try, but I would stick to the salads and seafood because my dining companions' food looked much better than mine.  

The bone marrow starter is rich and fatty (and although the description includes shallots, they're reduced into a sauce = no acid to balance the dish).  

The leg of lamb was overdone (I had ordered it medium rare, and it came out well-done) and was more refined in presentation than I expected.  The poached pears that came with still tasted strongly of brandy (the alcohol hadn't been property cooked off).  

For dessert, we had the il flotante, which was described as merangue, but was actually a fresh marshmallow (super soft, no merangue crust).  Super sweet, too sweet for me.
