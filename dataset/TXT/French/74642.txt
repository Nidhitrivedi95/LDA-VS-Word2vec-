xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g What an outstanding experience!  From the moment we entered the restaurant via the dedicated elevator to the moment we left we were fully attended. Our waiter was always there and never went MIA. The wine list was a bit intimidating, given the amazing high-end wines comprising their cellar, but we were able to tell the waiter our preferences and price point, and not only did he gladly made a recommendation, but he verified that choice with the sommelier and came back with a different option, which was outstanding. 

I had the beef Wellington, and my wife had the filet mignon with berneaise sauce. Both were outstanding. We further finished the meal with souffles, mine pistachio and hers caramel. Again both terrific. 

In addition to the great food and service, the view is spectacular. We had a window table overlooking the Bellagio fountains, which was an amazing addition to the already spectacular experience.
