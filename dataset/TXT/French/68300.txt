vg55SAkrEmuHpWfIMtJjBQ Took a colleague here for a nice dinner during which we had some important things to discuss - why not accompany that with some fine wine and food?! Overall, the experience was great from start to finish: super helpful hostess, who was calm and pleasant when I needed to make a minor change to the reservation and good waitstaff who were attentive enough to our requests.

And the food - so on point. Absolutely great, tasty and impressive. Can't wait to return.
