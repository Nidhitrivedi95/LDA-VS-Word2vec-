rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Yes I'm a fan! The salmon eggs benedict was very good! Not too much H-Sauce and not too messy either! My girls and I ordered a variety of sides that includes bacon, eggs, french toast and fries! The staff were very friendly and prices weren't too bad! A great place to start your day with a glass of OJ or Green Tea!
