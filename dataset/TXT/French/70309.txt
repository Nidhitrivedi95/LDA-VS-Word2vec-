X8lYvkI2Yv7f96cz4uE9LQ I love this place, it is easily in my top 3 restaurant list in Montreal.

Their duck ravioli with fois gras cream is scrumptious. I still think about it sometimes and get random cravings for it. Usually I'm the kind of the person that can't stop talking during a meal but this was one of the few times where I was too concentrated on how good the food was to say a word. 

I had the fish of the day as my entrée, I savored every bite and enjoyed the explosion of flavors in my mouth. 

I also liked the fact that they gave us little appetizers in between courses, it was a very nice touch. 

I wasn't wowed by the desert which was a panna cotta but that was probably because I was too full from the rest of the meal. I heard their ile flottante was amazing, I can't wait to go back and try it out.

 If you haven't been yet, don't walk, run!
