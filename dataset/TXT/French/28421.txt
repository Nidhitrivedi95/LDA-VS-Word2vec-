You can't choose a la carte. It's basically a prix fixe menu you sit down for dinner for $105 pp. You can either sit at the bar, the dining area or the chefs table so at least you can choose there because depending on where you sit, the food you get is slightly different. You can get wine pairings with the menu for an additional $75. It's my second time dining with alo and I have to say the food has been consistently amazing! From the dish selection to the plating, it surely satisfied my palate and my eyes. I really like how the food is placed on the plate and the fine details they think of for each dish. We had Christopher, the sommelier serve us the wine for each pairing and he would go on to tell us a story taking us to different parts of Europe for each wine he introduced. The service, like last time at the restaurant, was truly and consistently impeccable. They take care of you from start to finish and they really put the extra effort to make the dining experience for their patrons extraordinary. Really enjoyed the company of their staff. The only thing that is still a mystery to me is the shouting they have in the kitchen from time to time. Not sure what that signifies but if that peaks your curiosity too next time you dine with them, perhaps you can ask them!

Last tip? 

Seems like everyone books online! So be set to book 60 days in advance for the day you're looking for and stay up till midnight to do the booking. Rumour has it that if you persistently call them and let them know the date you're looking for, they'll try to help you out. If you also call two days in advance from the day you want booked, you might be lucky because cancellations last minute is common at the restaurant. Good luck booking!
