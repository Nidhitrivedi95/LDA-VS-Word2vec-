vLkKorA1gPS97Zj0_WKA0Q Twist sits on the 23rd floor of the building that houses the Mandarin Oriental;  it is a handsome looking restaurant with a spectacular view of the strip. The service is elegant but not stuffy; thoughtful but not over bearing. 

The bread service was good, with two different butters, salted and unsalted, but most importantly piping hot bread. 

My meal started off with a forgettable amusee, so forgettable that I've erm. forgotten what it was. For appetizer, I opted for the Alba truffle scallop mousseline, a pretty traditional preparation. The scallop mousseline was smooth and very refined; a perfect vehicle for the Alba truffles. A decent start to a meal.

For main course, I had the Ribeye done two ways; the loin of the ribeye was grilled and the tips of the ribeye sauted with sesame and a french bean salad. The dish was accompanied by a green cabbage fondue, a bordelaise sauce and 3 very minute crisps of potato chips on a nantaise marshmallow garnished with pickled shallots. The beef was exceedingly well cooked, but overly rich, especially paired with the tasty but oily sauted french beans. The green cabbage fondue again was delicious but overly rich when paired with the rich beef. I didn't care for the nantaise marshmallow  which I thought tasted like soap -- pity because I really needed the tartness from this side.

i opted not to have a desert; and finished the meal with some petit fours and a macchiato. The petit fours were tasty, but nothing spectacular.

I'm in two minds about this rating, and bordering between 3 and 4.

4 stars because the food in general was well cooked and delicious. 3 because I expected a lot more from a chef with this reputation. The menu read well, but didn't really inspire me or looked particularly interesting or exciting. No doubt the food was well cooked, but was it modern, interesting or inspiring; yess-ish, no and no. For the price, I would try the other Frenchmen's restaurants.
