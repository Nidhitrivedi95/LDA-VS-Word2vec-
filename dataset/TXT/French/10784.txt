4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw The Filet Mignon was absolutely delicious and I couldn't get enough of the sauce. I did not even need steak sauce to enhance the taste. The service was wonderful, my boyfriend and I had a nice conversation with the waiter. Our waters were constantly refilled, which is always a plus for me because I drink my water like a whale. The price wasn't to shabby either, especially for a good steak. The only complaint  that I have are the frites (i think that is what they are called). It is way too salty. All in all, its a great place to have lunch on a beautiful day.
