p0UAFRye2EibJU_3auW0rg This place is authentic & flavorful and the staff makes it an amazing experience. If you are looking for a delicious sweet or savory crepe, this is definitely the place to go! I have been going here for many years and the dishes are always consistent and have never changed! The three things I always order: Salad with the famous garlic dressing (to die for), french onion soup (amazing crispy cheese coating on top), and of course the famous crepes (strawberry and banana is my favorite)!
