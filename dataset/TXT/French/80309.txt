I had a hamburger and poutine and my sister opted for a poutine with veggies. Everything was great except that maybe they forgot it was a veggie poutine until the very end or they just did not ask. The cook threw all the veggies on the poutine raw (mushrooms, peppers, onions) which I thought was odd. We finished and my sister said it was "ok" and as we were paying, I noticed someone else had the same thing and they were GRILLING the veggies before putting them on the poutine. No big deal but that is the difference between a 4 and 5 star rating I guess.
