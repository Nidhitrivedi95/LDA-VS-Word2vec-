xsFJZu4nME615byZVrpMGA If you are looking for a breakfast or brunch place to check out and you forgot to make a reservation or do not want to stand in line, this is a great spot. Their food quality is decent and the old theater high ceilings are awesome (used to be Cumberland theaters). 

Great place for brunch/lunch
