hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA We have been here so many times, never had a bad thing to say about this place. The owners are super friendly. The food is great.  Last time I came I had the tuna sandwich which remind me of what I used to get in Europe. For dessert I had the banana muffin that was wonderful. My son had the chicken curry sandwich (one of his favorite), and his dessert was the chocolate tart ( best I ever had).
