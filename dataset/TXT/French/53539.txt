qltrxd6_usFu1Q0mM5ZCNQ This is a great place for a nice meal. It was recommended by my beau-frere. The ambience was really nice. Not too crowded (meaning the tables and seats were not flush against each other). I really liked the open kitchen because I like watching how food is prepared. It is kind of like watching a tv show live in a studio. We started with a potato salad, but it was no ordinary potato salad. The flavour was there, and the potatoes were not over or under cooked. The nice touch was the addition of mussels. For the main, we shared the salmon and the cauliflower, broccoli, Brussell sprout sauté. Both were delicious. The salmon was cooked to perfection (I find that most restaurants over cook their salmon so it is really dry). All I can say is that the chefs know how to prepare their dishes. Their homemade pickles were good too.
