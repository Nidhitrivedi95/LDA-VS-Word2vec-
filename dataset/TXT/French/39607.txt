jxkr9QI9w_QIG6JgSk7OLA We had a great experience at Les Sottises last Friday night. The service was excellent. We didn't have to wait long for our drinks or our food. The meal was also very good. I had the veal general Tao and I have absolutely no complaints. The ambiance was also very good. They had a DJ mixing lounge music. The music wasn't too loud so we could hear each other speak. 

Looking forward to trying something new there next time we go.
