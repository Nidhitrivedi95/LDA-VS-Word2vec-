KRgTdfs4oVFUcATMfAoR4A After getting our fix on poutine and crepes, we decided to have a nice dinner out and we found this place. We wanted French food, since Montreal is French influenced. For starters we had the Foi Gras (seared and in pate form), and Escargo. Both dishes were finely decorated and tasted as good as it looked. The chef even brought out fried cod for us to sample, in some type of orange tartar sauce. For an entree I ordered the cheek meat, which came on a bed of mash potatoes, corn, carrots, and string beans, all covered in a gravy sauce. The meat itself was very tender and flavorful. Although the food was good, service and food was very slow (maybe it's because we're spoiled Americans and we want to get in and get out..  Decor was dark and really set the mood except for me finding floaters in my water.  Anyways if you're in the area and feeling for some French this place is not too shabby.
