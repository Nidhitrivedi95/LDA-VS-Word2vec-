1aj4TG0eFq6NaPBKk6bK7Q Glad there's a healthy place nearby!!! 
My beau surprised me with a nice meal after work from Jacques. This is what he ordered: 
-tofu avocado taco
-garden burger
-sweet potato fries
-frozen yogurt with berries

Tofu tacos were delicious!!! Almost tasted like fish tacos! I could seriously eat those all day. Seasoning was just right especially when you add some lemon juice.
Garden burger was also really good, although my only complaint was that the patty was too salty and a bit mushy. Wish that it was somewhat crispy to give the burger some texture.
Sweet potato fries were average, nothing special here.
Frozen yogurt was great! But be warned... It doesn't taste like your average froyo, it tastes like actual yogurt that's still a touch sour, but is neutralized by the berry sauce or mochi that you add. I personally liked it, but then again I like "different" tastes.

Jacques cafe was tasty and I'll definitely be back to try more of their dinner portion like pasta and short ribs. They also have a lunch menu that's under $10 so super affordable. And if your health conscious, all their foods are labeled with V (vegan) GF (gluten free)  A (ginger aioli). Good job, boyfriend!!!
