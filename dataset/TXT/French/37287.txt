iwFoA98-OgcdXmNS0LxNOA went there twice within two weeks for lunch with a friend and dinner with my wife. The flatbread is really good, highly recommend. the rest of the food are average, sandwich, tuna poke, and sauerkraut tasted so so. beer will be a bit above average, nothing really surprises me.
