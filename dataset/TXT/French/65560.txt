U1LB3sRMGTu_h7Sf9QdNoA My initial experience upon walking in and ordering my tea was interesting. I was ready to give this place a 2-3/5, but then the guy who was serving us surprised me and gave me the best experience I could have possibly hoped for.

Context: If you know me, I have an anaphylactic peanut allergy, making any kind of food consumption particularly dangerous for "may contain" environments and situations where the desserts are either made offsite or brought in from another bakery. 

The desserts in this instance were brought in from another bakery, and thus the guy couldn't guarantee my safety. Dejected, I was ready to just order a tea, when he said "but wait, I can probably whip up something special for you", and boy, did he impress.

The picture is what it looked like before I absolutely demolished it - but basically, it was the perfect dessert. Warm (bread?) on the outside, cool (vanilla ice cream) on the inside, covered in chocolate sauce. It was a perfect match - cool/warm, soft/crunchy, and for a few minutes, I tasted heaven.

I'm very glad we found this gem; I'd come back any day of the week for that kind of service.

Pros:
- GREAT atmosphere - it's a house converted into a cafe - what more could you ask for?
- AMAZING selection of teas. I had "euphoria", but I was extremely impressed by the variety in offerings; normally, tea shops have a maximum of 3-5 teas, but this place easily had ten (and counting!).
- IT HAS A PATIO. Think about it - it's summer, you want to sit somewhere nice, and people-watch, with a nice coffee/tea and some food. Where do you go? HERE. Sure, it's winter-time when I wrote this (complete with snow & below 10-degree weather), but it's definitely a nice thing to think about
- AUTHENTIC French experience. The person working there was definitely a native French speaker. If I wasn't with people I was just acquainted with, I definitely would've tried to converse with the little French I knew.
-- This includes the varieties of teas and desserts. Didn't try the other menu items, if they had them, but in my experience it's not often you come across a Parisian/French cafe in Toronto.

Cons:
- Not amazing for bigger groups. We had 8 folks in our party, so it made seating arrangements particularly interesting. The person working there was able to accommodate us after shifting things around, but since he was the only one there, we could tell it might be a little troublesome. Not a big problem, but definitely interesting.
- It's TINY. I think that's the point of a cafe, but at the same time, it'd be nice if it was bigger than the bottom floor of a house.

Apparently they've opened a new location! -- I definitely have to check it out in the future. Try this place out if you want a nice, quiet environment!
