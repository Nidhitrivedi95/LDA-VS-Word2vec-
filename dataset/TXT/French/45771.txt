mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q My experience was somewhat limited as I dined at the bar and did not go heavy but outstanding nonetheless. Top tier steak tartar, the way it is supposed to be served and delicious jamon Iberico. The staff understands and knows wine and were extremely helpful. Very comfortable ambiance adding to the overall dining event. Perhaps a 5 star after I am able to enjoy a complete meal.
