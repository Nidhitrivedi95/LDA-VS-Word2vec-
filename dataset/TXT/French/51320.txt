P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ Wonderful fine dining experience!! No wonder it has two michelin stars...

We only had the $99 Pre-Theater menu, but it was more than enough for us and we were totally stuffed. In between the appetizer and entrees, we got little amuse bouche and other little treats. And the dessert cart selection was fun, allowing us to sample a lot of the goodies. And of course, excellent service.

I thought it was a great deal actually ;) makes your vegas trip feel totally different with a calm fine dining experience like this.
