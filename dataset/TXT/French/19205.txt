If you like peanut butter, I highly recommend getting the "better nutter" cookie. It's basically a peanut butter cookie sandwich. (~$2-$3)

The "better nutter" cookie really is TO DIE FOR. I absolutely love peanut butter and anyone who shares this love will enjoy this cookie as well.

The macarons are pretty good as well. They are a bit harder in the middle, but I like the chewiness.
