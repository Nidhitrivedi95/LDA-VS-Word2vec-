3FlWR_osNPb8dcqLgHebHw Worst restaurant I have ever been to.  It was our first time here.  They brought us bread and butter in a PAPER container!  You know, those containers you get at a fast food joints for ketchup.  Very unclassy.  We then ordered french onion soup, calamari, and the mussels.  We had to send back the french onion soup because it tasted like tomato sauce.  I have had delicious french onion soup before so I knew the difference right away.  The calamari was cold and had cheese all over it and the breading was gross!  The mussels were not good at all, and left a gross after taste in my mouth.  At that point we felt really bad to return 2 more dishes, but this will be first and last time we ever come here.  Please, if you are craving good delicious French food, go else where.  This place will disappoint you.
