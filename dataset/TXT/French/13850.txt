50-xiTYmE6NERi-yJ6NvHw We went here mostly because of the location and the fact that they have $1 oysters. The service was absolutely terrible.  Don't even come here for just oysters as they make it impossible.  You are only allowed to order 24 at a time and we were a party of 4 planning on just eating oysters. They took 30 minutes to bring one platter and would not let you order anymore until they were served. So ended up ordering steak frites and fish which was not great. The $1 a shuck oysters is just intended to get you in there. 

We will NOT be returning.  Lots of other great places to order oysters at.
