eDtBCZDo92LqBCIfE45hhg My partner and I came here after walking thru Old Montreal for the day and scoping out the other restaurants.  It was raining so we couldn't sit on the patio.  We decided to wait and sit at the bar until the weather cleared up.  The entire staff took the time converse with us for the half hour wait.  The host was very welcoming and explained the menu to us.  We decided to do the five course with wine pairing off the menu.  Three of the courses were a fish or seafood dish.  I'm not a fan of these foods but I was pleasantly surprise how good the dishes were.  The wine with each course was spot on.  The last course was dessert and I think it was the best dessert I ever had.
