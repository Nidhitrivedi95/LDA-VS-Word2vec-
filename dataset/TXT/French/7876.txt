4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw On another recent trip we dined here again.  We booked reservation via their website weeks in advance and they honored us with little wait.  FYI, seating outside on the patio is first come first serve.  If full you still may have to wait even with reservation.  We were lucky and got immediate seating.  The food was perfection as always.  I again went for their bone-in ribeye.  As was last time, the chef cooked it to perfection.  I was in steak heaven.  Keep up the good work.  We'll be dining there again on our next visit.
