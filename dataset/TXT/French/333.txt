-4TMQnQJW1yd6NqGRDvAeA I have been to this all around marvelous restaurant on numerous occasions and LOVE it! The ambiance exudes beauty, character and charm. Like every one of their stylish establishments, I walk in feeling like a dignitary, confident that anyone I bring will have an exceptional experience. 

Matt carter never fails to deliver the most delectable assortment of food choices catering to the palate of any level of sophistication. They offer a wide variety of small plates as well as family style entrees using the finest and freshest ingredients resulting in a staggering eruption of favors in every bite. My last visit i had the bound corn and leek, creamy tomato soup served with sourdough gruyere grilled cheese and fresh Oregon truffle slices And the sweet yet savory country pork ribeye, served with popcorn grits, apple glaze with braised fennel. I am convinced they add crack to every dish because it is ADDICTING!!

It doesn't stop there either. The bar does not fall behind to the slightest degree. Definitely try the Housemade root beer and the famous cinnamon whiskey fireball shots (they use their own secret ingredients) one of my favorites is the sazerac square- sazerac whiskey aperol and fresh grapefruit ( yummmmmmmy!) and an absolute must have is the Irish coffee made with a hand picked house espresso, Jameson whiskey, topped with a Madagascar vanilla whipped cream and Demerara sugar pieces, I am not a coffee drinker and had 4!

The best part of the restaurant is the fun and friendly staff. Brian and kevin definitely know how to have fun and will show you the time of your life!!!!! Needless to say if you haven't been by yet you need to stop in as of yesterday!!! They are open for lunch, brunch on the weekends and dinner 7 nights a week so what are you waiting for!!!!?????
