SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ This was a really really good meal. I took my co-worker there to celebrate a successful out of town assignment and it lived up to the talk. Great food preparation, amazing wait staff and a wonderful wine list.

Unfortunately it was raining so we couldn't enjoy the outdoor seating but otherwise, great meal.
