XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q I've been to this beautiful restaurant twice, both times loved it.

No restaurant in Las Vegas comes close to this. You can taste the quality in every part of this restaurant.

Even though Michelin no longer rates Las Vegas restaurants as of 2009, this is easily comparable to all of the 3 Stars around the world.

This is the epitome of stuffy restaurants, however. You walk into a very ornate setting with velvet and purple and very quiet patrons (at least my two experiences).

You can expect a 3.5 hour dinner with a freaking awesome bread cart with so many breads that will make your head spin.

Both times we went for the complete chef's tasting which we kind of regretted since it was SO MUCH food. Not the best kind of food you want to eat before you go out but it was great.

Highly recommend this place if you have a spare night that you know you won't be raging hard with, and if you are up for one hell of a meal to remember in Vegas instead of your typical whatever Vegas restaurants.
