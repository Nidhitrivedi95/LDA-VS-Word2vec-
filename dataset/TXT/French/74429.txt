xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g This is my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas...and anywhere for that matter. We made reservations the day before and asked to be by the glass to see the Bellagio water show. We were given the best seats in the house - right in the center on the glass. I was a bit cold during dinner so the waiter came out with a shawl for me. YES! this restaurant has everything to accomodate their guests.

My friend and I started off with the Romaine Lettuce, Poppy Seed Tuile salad. I ordered the Sautéed Medallions of Veal, Braised Vegetables, Wild Morel Mushrooms and she had the Char Broiled Filet Mignon. I can't recall the exact name of the dessert we ordered but it was an entire plate of mini chocolate desserts - lots of variety and absolute heaven. I can still taste it! Everything from the view, the staff, the atmosphere was absolutely perfect. Money very well spent.
