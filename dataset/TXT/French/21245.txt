B56AYe5GNuavMDtwFsXqzA I've been enjoying meals here for a couple of years and I love it.  I have had both their dinner and their brunch and it's all very good.  I love that at their brunch they have all you can drink mimosas.  They are very accommodating, especially for birthdays and anniversaries.  It is expensive, but the food meets that standard.  Everything I've eaten here has been good and the menu is seasonal and fresh.

I love the building, how it is decorated and the food is AMAZING.  The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because of the service.  If you are lucky enough to get the one really great waitress you are going to have a fun and exciting experience.  The other waiters that have served us are not nearly as good.  Basically they take your order and bring it to you.  They also get annoyed easily when you ask questions about the food or make it seems as if you are stupid.  They aren't out and out rude, but act just snobbish enough to annoy.  The food is so good that we just roll our eyes and tip accordingly, but it doesn't stop us from going.

If you are thinking about trying it, go for it.  It is also very romantic without being gaudy.  A very classy and intimate date place for sure.  Not an every day place, but a great place to splurge for authentic French food.
