ovtlrcsVRlgZZQUlHs_ovw I've been going here for almost 6 years. I love the fact you can go into here and get and amazing burger for 10 bucks or work your way up to the Chef's Specials. There is nothing on there menu that is bad, and I know I've had everything. French Onion soup, Escargot, and the Meatloaf is my favorite. I know what you're thinking Meatloaf... Yes it is amazing. Definitely grab some Martini's while you're here. Heather is the Bar Manager, and all of her cocktails are amazing!
