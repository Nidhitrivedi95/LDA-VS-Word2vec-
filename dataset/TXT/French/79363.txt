zIyqiWYKrCvAdGeWXXBxFw So, finally, another good quality restaurant in the beach....

If your tired of pub grub and looking for something more befitting of a Friday or Saturday evening out, Veloute is definitely worth a try....

For those from the 'hood, this is the new (and improved) game at the old Balsam Bistro location.

Very good quality, and some interesting pairings, for the summer they seem to have a focus on citrus enhanced sauces on most dishes, meat/seafood/pasta.  Hoping this indicates that they will have a very seasonally focused menu, more robust flavours in the winter perhaps ???

It also appears that they have slightly expanded the front patio, providing a couple more tables, well needed on the night we were there...
