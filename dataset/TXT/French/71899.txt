XI3iNUgChOfJk5ppjKVEQQ Set in an Old Montreal rustic stone and wood building, this eclectic decorated restaurant is sure to impress. We were six for dinner in the white banquet seating area. 

Some of us ordered wine by the glass, others ordered some tasty beer from a micro-brewerie, my friend opted for the homemade gin tonic and I ventured to order a good ol' mint julep. Interestingly enough the refreshing julep was served in manly Maker's MArk tin cup with a mini-mountain of hand crushed ice. 

As for the food, well let me tell you... Chef Benjamin Leonard (originally from Lyon) really outdid himself with his Mediterranean inspirations.  We ordered the Seafood Paella which was a treasure of flavors. The scallops were rich, melted in your mouth and cooked to perfection. The beef short ribs were very savory and very tasty. The half lobster was as sublime both to the eye and the palate. Definitely would consider going back.
