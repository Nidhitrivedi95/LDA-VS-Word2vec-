JezHN-9KKLTMbojq00VP0g I have only been to Le Petit Triangle once, on a business trip to Cleveland in mid-winter.  Getting there on icy roads and sidewalk was interesting, but it was well worth the effort.  Service was friendly but non-obtrusive and the food was excellent.  Crepe with apricot sauce was a diet-buster but worth it.  I will return next trip.
