rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Very poor service, waiter was not responsive to us, the bus boys didn't know where to bring the food, they kept bringing us other people's foods. This place's reviews has to be a scam or something because the 4 of us who went there to eat, all didn't like the food at all. Like how can you mess up bacon? Bacon was extremely dry and hard, it was like eating a piece of brick. The bread was cold and stale and hard. The eggs were cooked wrong. Slow service, when restaurant was extremely empty. They advertise well and make themselves look nice and boujee but it just isn't all that at all, if anything. This was garbage French food, not authentic, all hype and no substance. Cost was very high too for very underwhelming food and subpar service. Lobster was dry and no flavor. Our eggs Benedict had no flavor and just completely awful. We barely touched our food and left with a very small tip due to a overall horrible experience here for breakfast / brunch. Would not recommend, there are so many other places in Vegas you can eat from that is 10x better. Vegas offers amazing food and cuisine, this place doesn't compare by a long shot. Don't let these other "real" reviews tell you otherwise. Don't fall for these paid reviewers and tricks. Completely false. Don't waste your money or time. For the same price, we should have just went to places like bacchanal buffet at Caesar's or urban crawfish off the strip or even freaking Denny's! Complete avoid, spend your hard earned money elsewhere for the quality you deserve, not at this fake and pretentious place that not even one dish of theirs even meets expectations.
