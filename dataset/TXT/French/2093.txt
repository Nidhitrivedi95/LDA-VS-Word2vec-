The oysters with caviar were divine. The scallops with wine reduction and potato moussaline were heavenly. My wife had the filet mignon with mousseline twice and nearly had convulsions. She has ordered it both times we came here. The lamb was also amazing. 

We both had the chocolate fondant the first time. It was so good my wife ordered it again. I ordered the chocolate pecan bonbon this time. It was like a small dark chocolate cake with thick chocolate frosting. On the plate was Guinness ice cream, Bailey's Irish Cream foam, a tiny creme brûlée "block" and some candied pecan -- out-of-control delicious!

Again, the best meals we've ever had. And we've been all over: Paris, Rome, New York, Bangkok, Beijing, Shanghai, Kuala Lampur, London, Tehran, Phnom Penh, Boston, San Francisco, Singapore, Hong Kong,  Marrakech.
