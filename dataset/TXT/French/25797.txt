Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA MIX is an absolute beautiful restaurant and bar! Located on the 64th floor of The Hotel (Mandalay Bay), MIX offers amazing views of the strip and beyond. The theme of the restaurant is quite simple yet classy. The restaurant is divided into two different areas. One side is black. Like everything from the walls to the furniture is black. The bar area is red and the kitchen and a private dining table is located in the middle. On the other side it's completely different. Everything from the walls to the furniture is white. It's so classy and elegant and also offers spectacular views of the Las Vegas Strip. 

The menu at MIX is a very upscale dining menu. They offer quality foods such as caviar, foie gras, lobster and filet mignon. I came here for a couple different events so I didn't get the chance to try things off of the menu. 

==SERVICE==
The service here at MIX was great. The host was pretty cute and all of the cocktail waitresses were very friendly. They had plenty of servers coming around and delivering hors d'oeuvres. 

==FOOD==
They had different hors d'oeuvres such as chicken satay, sliders, shrimps, beef skewers, caprese skewers and more. The entrees were filet mignon with scalloped potatoes, pasta bolognese, mushroom risotto and chicken with sautéed vegetables. Out of everything I really enjoyed the sliders, mushroom risotto and the filet mignon. 

Even though the two events that I attended were free and the food was pre-set, I still looked over the menu and its on the pricier side. Although the price is a little high, it's definitely worth it in my opinion since the quality of food and the view are both spectacular. I'm definitely planning on stopping by MIX on my next visit to Vegas.

**You MUST stop by the restrooms here! Both have amazing views as you are taking care of business. It's not the nicest bathrooms, but the view is definitely worth checking out!
