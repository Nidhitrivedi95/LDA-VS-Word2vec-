USleI8g1UVN9-9jm-b4uIg The grouper and lobster entree was dry and the risotto rather boring, for an over $40 entree with no veggies. I remember getting a salad, but I don't remember it. Husband's caesar salad was oversalted.  My husband had the filet and it was ok, but nothing special. Wine recommendation had to be sent back, as it was a lame red...white wine decent, but pour was very chintzy. Waiter was a bit arrogant--just enough to dampen the mood. The table was long and we were so far apart and so close to the tables next to us, that we really couldn't talk.  We have years of experience with outstanding Charlotte food and various price points. This time was much different than our great experience at this restaurant a year ago.  We won't be back.
