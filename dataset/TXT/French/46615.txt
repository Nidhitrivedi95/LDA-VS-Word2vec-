Christopher's Restaurant is actually far from the WWE.  I would say it has a lot more class and realism to it.  Located inside the Biltmore Fashion Park, Christopher's Restaurant/Crush Lounge place is a hidden gem!  The restaurant itself is split into two areas, the restaurant and a lounge.  

The restaurant area is very hip with a contemporary feel.  It has an open kitchen where renowned Chef Christopher Gross and his sous chefs create his master pieces in front of patrons.  Yes, it is a delight to see an artist at work!  I definitely recommend sitting at the restaurant bar once to meet all the chefs.  

Crush lounge is the other half.  It's sexy and sleek.  Feel a bit naughty?  I hope I'm not the only after a visited to this bar!  The portraits on posted in front of the bar is very "mature audience" oriented.  If you can't handle the heat go to the restaurant; a lot more PG-13 on that end.  Crush lounge is an intimate area where you can enjoy your drinks and order some small bites.  The Crush lounge offers up cheese platters, pizzas, and some of your favorites from burgers to calamari.  

The food from the restaurant half is a nothing less than great!  If your palate doesn't say wow then have checked out.  Might need an MRI and put on injure reserved list!  Chef Christopher offers everything from your basic burgers and pizza to fine dining cuisines like Foie Gra and Duck Confit!  Trust me you're losing out on anything if you order here.  Matter of fact you'll probably come back to try the rest! - Enjoy!
