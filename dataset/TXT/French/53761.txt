qmh6zxtJ8C8-YiUPv7ySlw I must have hit the wrong day cause my experience was less than stellar.   2 good things...the view and the veal shank. The staff was extremely snoottie.  We might as well been dining at TGIF with the staff that didn't seem to care. I'm far from being anyone famous but waitstaff randomly changed hands towards the end even though we were the last to be seated, $36 for 2 glasses of b-day champagne and the waitress never even offered a selection of brands. And after we called for the manager she denied compensation for b-day celebration of the champagne. I'm sure if Tiger Woods was there he'd have his whole meal paid for.... DO NOT SPEND YOUR MONEY DINING HERE! Go elsewhere
