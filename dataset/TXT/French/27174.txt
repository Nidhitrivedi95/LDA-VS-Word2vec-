dd3GZs6zW2t7BM0cbxAzvg Honestly thought this place would've been way better than it was. Not having often been around the area, I -naively- made reservations for a Friday night; we had our choice of tables. Even so, service was cordial. 

However, we were subtly rushed out. (Maybe because we were occupying the prime table?)  service was professional, but also felt a bit condescending for some reason. 

For me, the food tasted microwave-reheated. I had the fish. I'm not sure what was on the side, but It was like a hard-as-a-rock hash brown topped with sardines and olives, and I couldn't cut into it, and didn't want to try it.

My partner had the steak and loved it. So I guess it depends on what you like/order. 

The whole theme is kitschy-French bistro. (On the menu: let us know if you're on some kind of weird cleanse) !
