mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q Since coming here, it's now one of my favorite restaurants! Now I need to seek all the Joel Robuchon restaurants. 

Definitely make reservations to sit at the counter. Chef Steve Benjamin was on-hand to run a smooth kitchen with a very attentive staff.

Highlights of the menu and what my fiance and I ordered were:

- Scallops carpaccio and uni:  Our favorite. We would go back simply to have this dish. The scallops were delicate and sliced perfectly. The uni really made the dish.

- Foie gras burger (sliders): Delicious. Would get this again! It's usually hard to find anything impressive about sliders but lamb + foie gras maybe key! 

- Foie gras stuffed-quail: Very good. Loved each aspect of the dish, the quail drumstick and the stuffed foie gras in the quail. Anything with mashed potatoes here is guaranteed to be a success. 

- La Framboise (aka The Surprise): Absolutely lovely and delightful. I'm usually not a fan of decadent chocolately desserts so I naturally gravitate towards fruit ones. I would get this dish again simply because of the presentation and the well-blended taste. Sorry, won't ruin it by telling you what the surprise is ;)

Overall, I would visit this restaurant again and gladly spend the $ instead of throwing it at the tables!
