IE-FSNn9Zx9YFx3nJV4C1A Great start to my stay in Montreal.
Ambience: Nice, classy restaurant with a French flair. A good place for a special or intimate dinner.
Service: My only slight negative - fairly friendly but a little snooty. I ordered in French but apparently my pronunciation wasn't good enough as the waiters always felt the need to correct me. Funny, I've never had a problem in France...
Food: Fantastic. I had the confit de canard (duck) which was that rare dish that was simply flawless - a beautiful balance of flavors and the perfect portion size. The desserts were also a nice surprise, with a little more variation than you normally see in french restaurants. it did however, have Crepe Suzette cooked table-side which some people might find a little cheesy. Also, I see that one of the other reviewers found their amuse-bouche a little strange. I was given a different one which was also a little unusual and probably not worth the effort. As for the wines, the wine list is okay but not many are available by the glass. Fortunately they did know what a Kir Royale was, so it didn't matter much to me.
Price: As is typical for French restaurants it's a little above normal but in this case it was worth it.
I'd go back if I come back to Montreal.
