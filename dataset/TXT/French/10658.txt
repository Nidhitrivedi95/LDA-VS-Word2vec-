4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw My favorite restaurant in Las Vegas! I have been here twice for dinner and once for lunch.

Bread comes with butter and a carrot topping. very interesting but good.
The scallops and french onion soup is to die for!
Filet mignon melts in your mouth like butter.
Also, if you sit outside, you can watch the Bellagio Fountains.
Out of all the fine dining places I have tried in Vegas, this one is still my favorite. The food is great and it is also cheaper than most other places.
