As it was winter, we opted to sit in the atrium-like seating area. Note: There are numerous heaters outside if you want to sit on the patio. But this area gave us the best of both worlds. We could view the Strip and people-watch, but were out of the cold and wind.

The service was excellent. We were frequently checked on, our water glasses never got below half full, etc. And our server was just very pleasant and awesome.

The wine, beer, and cocktail list is decent. I really liked that even when you order just a glass of wine, the bottle is brought out, presented to you, and you are given a taste before accepting the pour. I honestly don't think I've experienced that at any other restaurant. Very classy.

The lunch menu has many options, but I had to go with the steak frites, which really seem like the star here. You can order it prepared multiple ways with different sauces. I opted for the blue cheese one. They apparently pound their steaks to get them super tender. You practically don't need a knife. And it was juicy and wonderfully tasty. The fries were excellently prepared as well. It was truly a 5-star meal.

And the appetizer and dessert we had were great too. But that was one awesome steak. And all with wonderful service. So yep, I would rank this amongst the as good as it gets places.
