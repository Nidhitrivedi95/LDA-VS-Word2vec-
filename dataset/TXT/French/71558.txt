XcWlBj5oQgzKhR7Cxovj3w I had a 2 hour layover and wanted a sit down place for breakfast. Sat down at 9:50 and was told breakfast ended at 10, so the only eggs available were a French omelet. Four eggs supposedly and billed as coming with shoestring fries. It was 3 eggs at most, more likely 2 eggs with a couple of tablespoons of brown shoestrings that were garnish. Nothing else. Cost? $14 plus $3 for coffee. I know an airport meal is generally way overpriced, but this was out of line even for an airport.

Walk a bit and go to Barrio in the D gates.
