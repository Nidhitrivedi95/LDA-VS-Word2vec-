33Tr0eRki1Yamzleu4GMdw Came here today with my best friend to grab a coffee/ something to eat and to get some work done. It's a cute little French bakery with a fancy ambience setting. There are areas with couch like chairs to sit and get somr work done and there are tables to eat all around the place as well. 

The workers were very nice and even brought our food and coffee out to us. Since we've been here a few times we know that our favorite thing to get is the Nord. This time we decided we'd also try the sud since it has prosciutto and my friend really loves that stuff. We split both sandwiches so we could compare which was better. I also decided to get the americano coffee which was pretty tasty. The Nord was delicious as always and I love how they also provide a salad with the sandwich. The sud was too salty for me so I ended up leaving half of the half sandwich I was given by my friend. Later on we actually also tried the peach green tea and that was really good. 

Overall, we enjoy this place and the fact that we can go there to get some work done is great. They do provide free wifi like Starbucks which is great, but isn't so busy as a star bucks which is also a plus for us!
