4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Good enough to go twice on my trip to Vegas.  I fell in love with the brie and spinach crepe and the cheese board appetizer.  Staff is also very knowledgeable about wine.

Even on a 115 degree day, the patio is comfortable enough to eat on and it's really the only place in Vegas where you can eat outside on the Strip.  Great view of the Bellagio as well.
