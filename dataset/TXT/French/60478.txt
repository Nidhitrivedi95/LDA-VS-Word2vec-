SBnpT6JDbah-5l_52GM5sw Fantastic brunch. There was a bit of a wait but well worth it! We asked to sit by the window and got a table with a great view of the lake. My friends were raving about the lattes (bonus points for having almond milk on hand). The burger was juicy, flavourful and came on a great brioche bun. The smoked salmon was fresh and very tasty. We also got a brioche french toast for the table which was light and a great way to start our meal. We were just passing through on our way back to Chicago but would definitely come again.
