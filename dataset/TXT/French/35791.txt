hvjgF-vnPw2jyL5DBuB0qg I have been hoping to try Chuck's place for years and finally did this trip. It was great, really it was.  Would I go back?  Probably not.  The food was very good, the service even better.  We had the 6:30 seating which was nice because I understand it gets a bit loud for the 10 seating. We found the music great and although getting louder as time went on it was excellent. Was Chuck there;sadly not but the waitress was a wealth of information. 

Food:  Lobster poutine my friend had, she said was good but not great.  I had the best ever Caesar which turned out to be an appetizer in itself with crab (and it was fresh) and horseradish. My husband had beef ragout and he loved it.  Overall very good near excellent. I wonder if the hype doesn't pull it down somewhat.  

Loved finally getting there and having the experience.
