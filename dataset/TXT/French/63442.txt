t_1myTZfYeEQ07Jr8JEF5Q I actually can't believe I only gave this place four stars last year. I think I reviewed it too quickly after going and was still flabbergasted by all of the uneaten food, but it's been over a week... and I'm already ready for next season. 

Twelve(ish) divine courses, peppered with some delicious drinks, shots and glasses of wine with friends. Standouts this year were the hot and sour soup (complete with much meat and maple), the chef's meat pie, the pig's head with pancakes, the pineapple ice cream dessert, the good ol' maple on ice and absinth with maple sugar. 

My motley crew traveled from near and far to join in these sugar shack festivities and we were not disappointed. We opted to take a stretch limo from Montreal where we were all staying to ensure optimum coolness and so that everyone could drink until their maple soaked heart was content. If you are someone that likes being super cool like me, I recommend you lean into the extravaganza that is a dinner at Cabane a Sucre Au Pied De Cochon and get a limo, too. Also, ask your server if you can saber a champagne bottle with a lumberjack ax, if you have two fellas as charismatic as Jon and Ruggy, she will let you. 

A bientot!
