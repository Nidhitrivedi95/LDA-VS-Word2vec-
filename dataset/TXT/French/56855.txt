rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A With a high powered name like Thomas Keller behind the restaurant, expectations also run accordingly.  We went with a group of friends for dinner and felt that the food was fairly good, but not fantastically so.  It may have also been due to the fact that when you are in Vegas, with so many great places to eat, the curve works against you - it is like my freshman college bio class where 94% was a B+.

The highlight of our dinner was the trout almondine.  I am not a big fan of trout, but this one in particular was so tender and delicate that it was one of the best fish dishes I have ever had.  The sliced almonds provided a nice mellow nutty contrast to the trout.  It was one of those dishes that shine without having loud flavors but yet provide a soothing feel to the palate,

Saffron mussels were also decent, with nice creamy mussels.  We found the gnocchi was very doughy and bland - a definite pass.

Overall, we enjoyed our dining experience here, but not so sure that it would be worth a repeat visit, especially in this town.
