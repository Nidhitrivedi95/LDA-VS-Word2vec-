mnn--vaYHtNyBNYFYBFIog We were very excited to try Toque.  We read that it was on of the finest restaurants in all of Montreal, and is known for its sensational French cuisine.  Sadly, we were rather disappointed.  We found the price to be outrageously high, given that the portions were remarkably small, the food was average/above-average (but not exceptional) and the service was good, but hardly outstanding.  Overall our dining experience was fine, and worthy of a 3 or a low 4 rating, but certainly not a 5, and hopefully not the finest Montreal has to offer.
