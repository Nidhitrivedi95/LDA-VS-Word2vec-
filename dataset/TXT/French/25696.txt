However it's below my expectations in 2 areas - first the music / DJ was so-so, maybe only that night I was there, it was a Saturday night though.  The music was hard to dance with and the dance floor was very small.  Second is the fact that they have all the tables near the window marked as bottle service only.  So you can never get close to the window to enjoy the view, they don't even let you stand closer to the window.  It's a perfect place to be for a group or if you're planning to have bottle service.
