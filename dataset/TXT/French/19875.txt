aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw Since I visited both Bouchon Restaurant and Bouchon Bakery in Yountville, I was hooked.  Once I learned they had shop in Vegas, I knew I had to stop in there during my last visit to Sin City.  

Before checking out of the Palazzo, I headed over to the Venetian to order some goodies from Bouchon Bakery.  The line was wrapping around their little bakery station in the corner of the casino.  I had a hard time deciding what I wanted to order just by looking at their display of goodies behind the glass cases.  Finally, I decided on the following:  a turkey and brie sandwich, a carrot cake cookie, a cheese danish, chocolate croissant and a small coffee.  Yes, all of where were for just myself!  I'm a glutton =)  My boyfriend had already left and took an earlier flight home so I was able to spoil myself with these yummy treats.

Everything was deeeeelish!  I would definitely be returning for more sugary carby heaven.
