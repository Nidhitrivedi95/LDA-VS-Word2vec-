The food is okay and the wine list is okay, I'm only giving it three stars because I just find it too pricey for what it is.

But I have to say I got fantastic service from the hostess. We walked in without a reservation, she took our name and number and we went down the street for a drink. As soon as a table opened up she called us and we came over quickly. Very cool!
