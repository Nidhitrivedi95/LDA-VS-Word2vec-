HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw My husband and I stopped by to grab a cocktail while killing time before dinner at another restaurant. I had the Fair Trade (quinoa vodka, Torani Amer, lemon juice, lemon zest, simple)--the first time I've seen Amer in a drink besides  picon punch. Next was the Rose Eight (bourbon, OJ, lemon juice, and grenadine, with rosewater sprayed over the top), and it was the Rose Eight that has sparked a thousand Rose Eights. Well, maybe not that many, but it's kind of our drink at home now when the husband feels up to mixing something.

After looking at the happy hour menu, we found ourselves unable to resist, so we ordered the trio of deviled eggs, then were a little sad we had dinner reservations elsewhere, because everything looked so delicious and we didn't want to stop.
