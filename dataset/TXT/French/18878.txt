aM4pb4teV2Tr0Z-ZRt4icg Macaroon Ice Cream Sandwich was sooooo yummy and $3 something wasn't asking to much so I couldn't complain on bit! Staff is very friendly and location is lovely great for meeting a friend or dropping in while on a date. But I just wish prices where not so crazy on Macaroons it was like a box of 4 for nearly $10.... definitely one of the most expensive places I've been to for them and I probably won't ever get to try them because of it unless I'm just getting one for a taste.
