FRuuIDOd21pTJHvEGIt1Gg What a disappointment. I have been fond of this place for many years, and I made sure to bring my colleagues here when we arrived in Montreal. It was frustrating from the start. The server said we would have to hurry. She forgot the bread after several reminders. The silverware was taken for no reason. One entree was wrong, another was overcooked. Nothing was done to amend it. I was a little embarrassed. Too bad.
