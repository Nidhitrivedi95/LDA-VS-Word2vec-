nkHaix6KenApS8M-liZsCQ Maybe the food is good but the bald guy at the front door, that apparently was the manager, was unnecessarily rude. Not only to is, but to 3 ladies that walked in behind us. We walked into the kitchen bar that was empty. My friend set his shopping bags on a stool next to him and was immediately told that he needed to move them because there are people that wanted to sit there. Where??? We were the only people there!!! The ladies that came in behind us looked at the menu and said they would be back in 15-20 minutes. One lady says to the other that she would like to walk inside. The bald guy smarts off that they should not make that request in an outdoor mall. Then, turned to me and says "well! It is!!"what an idiot. Macys is inside. We left...
