Yp9w4nhUowBU_IS_StFXbQ I was at the convention center and looking for a place where I could get a late breakfast and take a break from the convention floor. This place is in the Wynn so I new it would be nice.

I got the eggs benedict - my splurgey breakfast choice when I'm travelling. And this was probably the best eggs benedict I've ever had. The bacon had a perfect smoked scent - not too overpowering. The tarragon in the hollandaise worked well. Served with coffee and fresh squeezed orange I was a happy camper.

Service was great. And the ambiance was relaxing - which I really needed.
