uP3H5bcsiTXM0k0xQhRndg Food has never tasted so good. I feel I need a bigger vocabulary to explain in detail the amazing tastes that are flowing through my body. My taste buds have exploded and been reborn, I'm not sure I'll ever eat the same again! 

I'll start with the service, as I was near turned off by coming in; with a sign on the door that read please wait here. It is a very small place. Yet, I was greeted at the door with a extremely friendly face. Welcoming me in and seating me. She grabbed a vase of water and filled my cup as she described the restaurant and the cook. I was told by the person next to me the soup (celery and blue cheese) was amazing, so I grabbed a half order. Please, do yourself a favor and don't order more than that unless you don't plan on eating your full main meal! Yet, if you don't try it, you'll be missing out. 

The host/waitress/owner recommended that I try either the Mac and cheese or "the ultimate experience". I picked the ladder. And this is the reason I wrote you the longest review I've ever written, because this place cannot be passed up! The ultimate experience was pork belly that melted when the knife touched it just right. A nice crispy top with the most tender, melt in your mouth, middle. They say it takes five days to prepare. I took my first bite...melted into nothing, then picked up my phone to write this. 

Alcoholic beverage: sortilege (Canadian whisky and maple syrup) DELICIOUS!

So....I was chatting and stated I was from Texas and was sad I wouldn't be able to try the mac and cheese; they brought out a plate of the mac and cheese and told me, "you have to try our signature dishes." I'm blown away!! 

Whatever God you pray to, pray you live long enough to make your way to Le Robin Square; the best overall food establishment in all of Montreal, if not North America!
