Kut9tVbDX_f7qKMRRoXg3w "I love to travel" - yawn, generic, everybody says that, who doesn't like to travel. . .

Ok, tough crowd, let me tell you how I like to travel.

I like to stay at small bed and breakfasts, preferably with my own fireplace.  I like to talk to the ppl of the B&B while I break my fast on recommendations of places to go.  Where should I eat, what should I see. . . And that is how I found Marche De La Villette. 

My girl and I were staying at a cute B&B in Old Montreal and asked where should we go for lunch and we were directed here.  A cute and crowded cafe that was quaint, warm and welcoming.  

- Perfect quiche lorraine, warm, piping, inviting.  
- Perfect French onion soup, well rounded flavors with just the right amount of cheese.  Not too much papa bear, not too little mama bear.

Even though I was stuffed to the point of uncomfortable reflux, I could not help asking to look at the menu again. I. WANT. MORE.  What else can I try?!?!

My friend had to reason my gluttony down and promise that we would return again before we left Montreal.  And we did, the last day, I ran to grab take out as our limo was waiting to take us to the airport. . . 

And that is how I like to travel :-)
