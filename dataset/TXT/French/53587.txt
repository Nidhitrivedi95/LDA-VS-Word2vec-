qltrxd6_usFu1Q0mM5ZCNQ Why do people think it's trendy to have super uncomfortable seats? This is not cool, this is annoying. 
Also, any food that is deep fried, battered, cooked in copious amounts of butter or covered in syrup is going to taste good but that doesn't make you a good cook. It makes you an overpriced McDonalds. 
The brunch options had enough calories for the rest of the day and the vegetarian options were either a salad or one of two sugary dishes that would make a poutine look like ax kale smoothie. What about an omelette? What about eggs florentine? This restaurant just invented a bunch of super fattening dishes to compensate for the fact that they're mediocre chefs. 

Finally, 3.50 for a very small glass of room temperature orange juice? Unless you have the orange tree in back, this a rip off.
