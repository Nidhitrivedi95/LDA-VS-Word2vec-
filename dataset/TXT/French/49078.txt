OmFXBWLv1DoFelP2-RLqFA With the food being quite pricey as ranked $$$, the service was waaaay worse than foodcourt/fastfood cunters, from the moment we sat down till we walked out the door, UNBELIEVABLY BAD!
Moreover, the manager doesn't even give a sh*t about the customer's complaints, forget about any compensation you'd expect. 
Go if you don't expect any service while paying $40-60/person, I would never go back!
