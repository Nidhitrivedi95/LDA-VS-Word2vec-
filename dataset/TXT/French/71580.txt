XcWlBj5oQgzKhR7Cxovj3w We stopped in here between flights last Friday. We didn't have a lot of time, I'm sure that is a common problem in the airport, but Jonathan addressed us as soon as we sat down, made some recommendations on the beer and the food, which was very good by the way.

Jonathan was very helpful and courteous. If you are in the airport, check out this restaurant and ask for him by name, don't forget to tip !
