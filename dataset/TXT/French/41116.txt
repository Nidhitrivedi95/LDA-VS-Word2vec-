KfaVcE_jM8YkxiJMPdoRFg We came on a rainy Sunday evening when it was not very busy.  Good thing.  I would hate to see how long it would take to get seated and our meals if they were actually busy.  Nonetheless and overall good evening with some highs in the food department and when we finally got our server, things went well.  
Note: Make sure to buy your wine before you get there and bring it in!
We shared some apps, the fried calamari, and it was a little chewy.
For the mains we had a huge portion of mussels Provençal.  The mussels themselves were nice and tender however the sauce was a bit thin.
The meat on the osso bucco was to die for.  Soooo tender and yummy and lots of it.  The pasta was cooked al dente but once again, the sauce was a little thin.
So some great highs that would have merited a resounding 5 stars but for the sauces being a little thin.  Would definitely go back!
