63qPRnFAjxtchnSTWBxwbw I tried the hot dog , i was disappointed because it came in cibatta bread ...The menu didnt have any pictures of the food , so that got me very indecisive . The sandwich had an over-powering taste of horse radish or dijon mustard idk .... on the bright side the waitress was cool, the sauce, fries we're good. barely overpriced , not a good place to go if ur strugglin, sitck wit shitty quebecois fast-food joints , not really .
i recommend the poutine and fries with their special aoli
