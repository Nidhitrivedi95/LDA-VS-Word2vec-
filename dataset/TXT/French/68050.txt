vg55SAkrEmuHpWfIMtJjBQ If you want to have a memorable meal and an absolutely perfect--yet still relaxed-- dining experience, Legume is the place to go. 

I have eaten here on several occasions: two full-blown "celebration" dinners, one buffet meal at one of their Solstice events, and two or three times at the adjoining bar Butterjoint for burgers, cocktails, and/or dessert. Each time the food has been delicious, beautiful, and seasonal. I had the best steak of my life here, as well as some of the most mouthwatering desserts (here's looking at you, panna cotta with honeycomb!). On my first visit, we requested chef's choice, and were blown away. Particularly memorable was an appetizer of whole smoked fish with chutney, which was out of my comfort zone, but entirely delicious.

 If you want the full experience you can go the appetizer-salad-entree-dessert-wine route, for sure, but you would not feel uncomfortable at all ordering just an entree, or some appetizers and desserts to share. I really feel Legume is a good value considering the quality, portion, and overall presentation of the food. The service is equally awesome; professional and knowledgeable, but always friendly and approachable. 

I would highly recommend visiting Legume any time you want a delicious, exciting meal without stuffiness or pretension.
