4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Finally got to try Mon Ami Gabi last week and it did not disappoint.  Called in to get reservations and had no problems with that.  Got seated promptly and service was fantastic throughout the entire night.  

I started with the Onion soup which was pretty good. 
The steak, although it was thin, was cooked medium rare and was delicious. Sauce was nice and spicy. 
 
We also split some sides: garlic spinach, whipped cauliflower, sauteed mushrooms, and the macaroni gratin.  Mushrooms were really good, everything else was ok, but not memorable. 

Overall, all the food was great.  Service was fantastic.  Ambiance/atmosphere was nice, probably a nice date spot.
