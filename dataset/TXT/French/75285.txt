Y3e_rfMxAPFWI03ZgnpPxg I had been viewing art at the National Gallery in the morning then walked over to this low-key restaurant in Hunter's Square for their prix fix lunch, quite reasonably priced at £10 for 2 courses or £11 for 3. I had read about Le Sept weeks ago prior to flying to Edinburgh and looked forward to planning a day to go there. I started with an excellent salmon and shrimp salad on a bed of greens and tomato halves; it was very flavorful with a generous portion of smoked salmon. I had the chicken and ham pie that had layers of crisp baked phyllo over big chunks of chicken and ham slices in a white cream sauce. It was quite satisfying but wait... I could get dessert for just £1 more? I was all over that, getting an excellent white chocolate ice cream with chocolate rolled cookies. I was replenished by the high quality and excellent value of this meal without slipping into a food coma and would be all too happy to return in the future. Le Sept has been in business for 25 years and obviously doing a lot of things right.
