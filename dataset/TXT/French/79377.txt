Zl6csaZ5HBka3SKBphHXrQ Worst place for brunch..I have never had such bad omelette in my whole life..it felt like the omelette they serve at planes for breakfast,very tasteless..our food arrived after 30 minutes although we were the second couple who got in to the restaurant..we ordered americano which was also very bad quality..very disappointed..we will never go back
