ZrHU8ZzwZQjTRpB1K_8JTQ Bottom Line (at the top): We were pleasantly surprised with our visit to 1847 tonight.  I've never left a Yelp review before, but I thought the current average  "star" rating did not reflect the experience we had, so here we go:

We called at 4:30 for a 6:15 reservation and were told there was nothing available at that time, but they would take our name anyway.  The host said they couldn't guarantee us a table, but odds were good that they could fit us in since it was early in the night.

We showed up and, even though the place was busy, the host remembered our name and sat us upstairs right away.

My wife ordered a Finn's #7 cocktail which was a great drink and I had a Triple Karmeliet (yes, they had it on tap). Both drinks were served in a timely manner and our waters were refreshed regularly. 

We both ordered the Cod/Fried Fish Fry.  Both showed up promptly and were delicious.  The dishes were more like elevated fish and chips (with perfectly roasted rosemary potatoes instead of fries) than a standard fish fry.  The meal came with warm, fresh rolls.  The service throughout was on point.

My theory: the locals are not reviewing here on purpose to keep this restaurant a hidden gem.  Whatever kinks existed at the beginning have been worked out...this place is legit.
