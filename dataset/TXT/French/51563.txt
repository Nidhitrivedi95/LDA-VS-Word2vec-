pKiSzUlBBRNEdTML24piXA had an excellent breakfast outside in the sweet patio on a warm morning under the shade of trees. the Italian Skillet was flavorful with pesto,  caramelized onions, poached eggs and potatoes. my companion enjoyed the Eggs Benedict with their light hollandaise sauce over focaccia bread. good to know there's an option other than Matt's Big Breakfast for morning culinary excursions in downtown Phoenix!
