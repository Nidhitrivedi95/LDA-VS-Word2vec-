rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Bouchon is an amazing place to have breakfast in Vegas! I had the softest waffles I've ever eaten here. They also give you half a liter of iced coffee if you order iced coffee, and it is fantastic! I'm a major iced coffee fan who probably spends at least 3 hours a day with an iced coffee cup in hand, and the iced coffee here was super tasty and not bitter at all. Even my boyfriend, who absolutely hates coffee, was drinking cups of it with me. All the waiters we had here were very friendly and polite. There is also the option to sit outside among a gorgeous view of different plants and the Venetian pool. Overall, really recommend!
