s1NqIkLMCFX6PuTk6wt6QA Cute diner with an interesting take on old classics. Paul got a "chicken pesto burger" and I got the "tofu club sandwich". I was super excited to see that they had many more-than-vegetarian-friendly options, meals actually designed around tofu instead of just excluding the meat!

I ordered coffee and Paul got the house made peach iced tea, which was delicious. The coffee was decent but I had to ask for a refill despite being one of two tables there.

When the food came we were stunned by the amount on the plate. Many fries! Much sandwich! The club came stacked high (or long, I guess) with well-buttered toast, sauteed mushrooms, thick tofu, mayo, and tomato. It was delicious and rich and hard to eat without loosing most of the mushrooms. Worth the challenge. The chicken burger is what Paul describes as "unexpected, not exactly what I wanted, but good". There was little pesto, but rather a very chicken-y flavour. The bun was crisp, but not too crisp, and the other toppings were great. The mountain of fries were thin cut, extra deep fried, and amazing. The salad ok, cute and colourful but too vinegary, especially with the pickled onions.

All and all, great and unique food at a fair price, would return.
