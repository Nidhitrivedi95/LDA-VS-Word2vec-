kcF-en40P3J9L8nLy5lKqQ impressed, had the duck 3 ways as an appetizer...delicious! My husband had the Chicken Parm its was huge came with mac & cheese and a tomato sauce (lacking on the flavor) but over all very good. I enjoyed the chicken pesto pizza phenomenal! Perfect crust! Staff were very friendly including the manager Tom. We will certainly be returning.
