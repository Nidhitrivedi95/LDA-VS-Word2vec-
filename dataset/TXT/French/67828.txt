UxWH8zRYIBgs6Q2oykvRdw Toronto, Canada's Cluny Bistro restaurant serves up a bread pudding style Chocolate and Vanilla French Toast- normally not a huge fan of bread pudding french toast but this one is not too bad. Chocolate cooked between layers and a vanilla whip on top gives it a nice sweet flavor, don't think I even used the syrup. Final score: 7.5
