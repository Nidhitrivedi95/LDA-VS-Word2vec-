V0iYi5OjdRcz82m95jV7vQ In all fairness I did not try the croissants, but what I did have was a level below Amelie's. First off, the lady behind the counter was extremely friendly and helpful. Unfortunately this place lost its credibility in the desserts that I tried.

The vanilla eclair was hard, and lacked flavor. The inside cream tasted extremely generic. I also tried a vanilla macaroon, which was also harder than normal and tasted like it was left in the refrigerator too long. Unfortunately I left and went straight to Amelie's for my sugar fix. I did enjoy the friendly staff!
