2gUbgbdJ7IFSbicBXlSchw One of the Montreal greats. I had high expectations of the place and it did not let me down. 

We ordered the bone marrow to start, and the steak et frites and liver for our entrees. The bone marrow was too oily for my taste (there was nothing added to cut through it), but still fun to scoop out and eat with crackers. The steak et frites were good, nothing too memorable though. However, the liver was delicious. I am usually not a fan because it tastes too much like iron, but this liver was creamy, hearty, and delicate all at once. 

The service was pretty good. Our waiter was friendly, but the older man that seats you was a but rude. 

Me: Hi, I'd like a table for two. 
Him very gruffly: Well do you have a reservation?! (It was nearly empty behind him because we went for an early lunch)
