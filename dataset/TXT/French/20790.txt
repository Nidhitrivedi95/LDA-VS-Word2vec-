I LOVE this Restaurant & French Bakery!
Located in Caesar's Palace, I had breakfast here 5 out of 7 days. 
Service is impecable - Thank You ASH!!! You are such a perfect to this company! There were two Chefs, Both excellent. The Bacon Eggs (any style) and roasted potatoes are prepared to order and perfection - why go anywhere else!?
For a late Breakfast/Lunch on one of the days I was there I tried the Ham & Cheese Quiche. It was delicious and baked to perfection! My mother would have LOVED this venue. 
I just cannot ask for anything better: Impeccable food (and delicious Coffee and Fresh Orange Juice); Friendly, efficient and intuitive service, and completely reasonable pricing!
I go to Las Vegas every year and no matter if I stay at Caesar's or not - I will seek out Payard's!
