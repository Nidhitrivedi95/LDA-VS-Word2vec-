OmFXBWLv1DoFelP2-RLqFA Lots of small plates that were delicious. Had the beet salad with goat cheese and the salmon croquette.Fish soup with kimchi and Israeli couscous salad were also good.We shared everything and were quite satisfied.They have a nice selection of full course dinners. Nicely decorated, quiet restaurant with a very friendly staff.
