ehRigNzlkRQlvhzKr7PLCQ I have been wanting to try this place for weeks! Went today but unfortunately had to leave without trying it. Walked in and all employees were talking at bar, finally got seated by a pleasant person and waited 10 minutes for two waters and there were three of us. The waiter/busboy (not sure) said he would be back with another water. Waited about ten more minutes before I asked two servers that were clearing empty tables if we had a server. She said oh yes and walked back to the bar area. Still no server for another ten minutes got up to leave and they all turned to look at us confused but said nothing. Really disappoint especially since I own a restaurant. By the way the restaurant only had about four tables seated and I counted at least four employees.
