vLkKorA1gPS97Zj0_WKA0Q This review is from an April 2013 visit.  My daughter son in law and I came here for the tasting menu. 
I love the restaurant itself it is so pretty and the view is awesome. The food was fabulous I wish I had taken time to write review then so I could remember each course I just remember it was one of my favorites. 
Service was excellent.
