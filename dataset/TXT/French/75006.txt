XZ7eQLjyGXf6y69UT4SGhg Kind of a strange shopping  center for this little gem. They would put some of the higher cost pastry cafe that's on the strip an major hotel to shame. They only reason they didn't get the 5 stars was the service was a bit slow and it wasn't even crowded. All that said, it's a must go.
