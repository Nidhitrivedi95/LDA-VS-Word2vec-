fFInb4Dl2Ix4iE-VOltbkQ An amazing burger.  This restaurant specializes in beef and it shows with the burger.  I think they must grind their own meat.  

The burger is juicy (but not greasy) and topped with three cheeses and perfectly cooked bacon.  The bun, which is an important part of the burger, was nicely toasted.  The fries were also good.

The atmosphere was club-like with lots of energy and color.  The service and friendliness could be a little better.  My waitress disappeared for a long period and then proceeded to tell me her troubles in the bathroom...  not appetizing when someone is serving food!  

Overall, the burger and energetic atmosphere made up for the lacking service and friendliness.  A good place in old Montreal for a nice meal.
