ysJo5Jdo29XOBCnKrbUKWg wow - several hundred dollars later and I left the restaurant hungry.  I hate writing this but in this economy I have to warn others.  Overpriced for what you get - portions are very small and everything is a la carte. They are trying to be something they are not.   SLOW service - 3 hours to feed our table on a slow wednesday night?  We were starving and had to ask for more bread.

Avoid the salmon - it is dry - the risotto was inedible and dry, the coffee only lukewarm, steak and fritte good but expensive for what you get.  Shrimp and pasta lacked flavor and had WAY too much butter -  Lovely server but slow slow slow. Macarons good but I can get them elsewhere.(the ones from the French bakery in Millvale are larger and more reasonably priced)  I was so excited to come for dinner - so disappointed.  Chairs on deck in back are terribly uncomfortable when you spend three hours seated on them. Please put cushions on them

  Not sure I would ever go back and I love french cuisine. Please reconsider your prices - even our expensive dessert crepe was lacking.  So sad.   so very sad this was not a good dining experience.    Even sadder that no one asked if we enjoyed our meal.  Loved it when it was just crepes and salad place - now.....not so much.  

 Back to the french bistro in Sewickley when the urge for french food strikes again.  

Sad, sad, sad.  I really wanted to love it!
