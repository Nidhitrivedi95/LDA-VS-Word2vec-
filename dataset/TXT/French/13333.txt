4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw It's so difficult to pick a place to eat in Vegas with the multitude of options. I guess a packed house, like one is sure to see at Mon Ami, is a good sign.

I found the bread to be stellar and a cute display (served as baguette style, as one would find in France; although in France, they don't have paper bags for their baguettes. I'm just sayin'). I had beef bourguignon and I bet even Julia Chiles would be proud of this version. Although, she might have been disappointed by my noodles that were waaaaaaay too soft.

I'm pretty disappointed by my cocktail. How can a French restaurant mess up a French 75? 

The ambiance was nice with the heaters, the music and the Bellagio fountain show. I did feel a bit crowded on the patio though. There was little space to move. 

All in all, I would like to have my money back to try an equally expensive restaurant with a higher quality food and experience. You know Vegas has it. When you find it, let me know.
