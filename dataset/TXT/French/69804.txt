WOd8tWsh2Yt_osHv-ngx_w We stopped in for breakfast and immediately liked this place. Plenty of tables, including ones outside so on nice days you can dine al fresco. The menu is extensive, so you are bound to find something you like here.
I had the Universel Omelet, loaded with bacon, sausage, ham, red onions, mushrooms and cheddar cheese (I passed on the green peppers). I could barely finish this tasty behemoth. My friends had the apple, bacon and cheddar crepe (delicious, huge, hard to stop eating) and the basic ham and eggs (good job with the classic).
Service was very prompt and attentive, and the coffee cups were never empty for long.
The only reason this place didn't get 5 stars is the price - $15 for an omelet - but it was really good so we went back again.
