gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA Have you been to a restaurant in Vegas which was somewhat quiet? Ever? One that had a spectacular view of the city in the distance? One that offered wonderful service in a highly romantic atmosphere? All while you drank Chateau Montelena?

Come here and don't feel bad about skipping the tasting menu. Order from the regular menu, order a nice bottle or two of wine, and immerse yourself in the company of your dining companion. You will be very pleased you made the decision to come here.
