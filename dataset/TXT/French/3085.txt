1aj4TG0eFq6NaPBKk6bK7Q Jacques Cafe was a wonderful find to satisfy both those of healthy and not so healthy appetites. For those who are gluten free, they make a great homemade gluten free bun as well as a very good apricot cobbler. Our first lunch here I had the black bean burger on ciabatta with sweet potato fries. Very satisfying!  The highlight of my lunch was definitely the dessert. They have a few different pastries (some gluten free) but the standout is the Bonini ice cream. When in the desert, indulge in ice cream!
