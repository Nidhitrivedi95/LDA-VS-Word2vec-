SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA Easily the best restaurant I have been to in Cleveland.

I attended Case Western Reserve University, but never thought to try a restaurant "on campus" as a student. However, after reading so many stellar reviews about this place, I decided to finally give it a chance. I actually ate at this restaurant alone and had a phenomenal experience. I ate at the bar and my server seated me to a little corner by myself that was peaceful compared to other bar atmospheres. She was excellent and explained the best features of the menu and I thoroughly enjoyed the fact that she gave me very personalized attention. I am vegetarian, so she explained what dishes are great and what makes them so. I ended up ordering the Root Vegetable Cassoulet because it seemed unique and unlike anything I have ever eaten before. It was served in a really small dish, so at first, I was concerned that I made a mistake in ordering the dish. However, it was SO tasty!! The beans and abundance of vegetables made it extremely filling even though it didn't seem like it would be. The goat cheese taste was perfectly balanced with the white beans and the flavoring of the dish was near perfect. For dessert, I ordered a Creme Caramel and it was simply decadent- probably the best flan-like dessert I have ever had! I don't like sweets with TOO much sugar, so the Creme Caramel was just what I needed. Absolutely amazing. Without a doubt, a star restaurant.
