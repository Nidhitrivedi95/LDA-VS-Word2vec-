4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Have been here a few times and while it's usually ok the most recent one was phenomenal.  I had the hanger steak with frites and a red wine reduction sauce. I'm a huge fan of hanger steak and it was really good but the red wine reduction was amazing. Wish I had a side of it to dip the fries into.
