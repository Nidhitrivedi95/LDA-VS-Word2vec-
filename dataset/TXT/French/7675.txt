4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Was excited to try this place for breakfast and we were seated quickly. Ordered the Eggs Benedict special w beef as did a buddy of mine. The dish came out cold plus the eggs were hard boiled! We sent it back and my friend wanted to change his order.  They brought out two of the same eggs benedicts and didn't offer any apologies.  I could understand if the place was crowded and busy but it wasn't. Our waiter just stood on the side chatting w other waiters.  Won't come back.
