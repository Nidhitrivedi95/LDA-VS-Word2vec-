Yp9w4nhUowBU_IS_StFXbQ We came here with about 9 girls for a bridal shower and we all loved the atmosphere and service here. It's a little pricey, but you're definitely paying for the upscale service and decor. 

We all enjoyed our food, I got the chicken sandwich and it was amazing. Not oily or too heavy but still had lots of flavor. Their one time use tea diffusers are so cute and fancy looking. The waiters also give you little stool for your purse. Your purse! Lol they look like little sofas by your foot and you set your purse on top of it. I definitely recommend Tableau, it's good for bridal shower brunches like us or a relaxing brunch after a night of partying with your girls.
