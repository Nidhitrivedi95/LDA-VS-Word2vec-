m9aFZk1f8tSv248YErbpQA When my husband and I got to Chez Vous, nobody said anything to us and we found that very odd. I mean absolutely nothing...no "hi", or "all of our tables are full right now"...nothing. We continued to stand there next to a sign that said, "Please wait to be seated" for twenty minutes and still nobody said anything to us. There had been a table open for 5 minutes and yet, there we still stood. Already, I had a bad taste in my mouth about this place and we were about to leave but based on the great reviews on Yelp, we waited assuming the food was great. Finally, we got seated and the service was horrible the whole time. My husband and I both ordered crepes and my husband ordered a creme brûlée. My husband's crepe was soggy and mine lacked any taste (the best part of my crepe was the fruit and I can buy fruit anywhere). My husband assumed the creme brûlée would be great which is why he even ordered it. To his disappointment, he said that it was the worst creme brûlée he has ever eaten. My parents have talked about trying this place, and I told them not to bother.

***The rude owner just messaged saying that at least now I know French food isn't for me...interesting considering I've had amazing French food made by my French friends including crepes. I just don't like lack luster French food. Learn how to treat customers with respect.
