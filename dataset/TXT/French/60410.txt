The restaurant is located right by lake Monona and it has very charming outside seating where you can enjoy the lovely weather and the light wind from the lake. It is very charming. I love coming here for breakfast and brunch because the view is just amazing. Definitely try the moules frites because the white wine sauce is just amazing. The dish is very well cooked and well seasoned. I had the seared salmon and my boyfriend had pan-roasted skate wing. The sauce for both was pretty buttery which made the whole dish so good. I wish they would have put more green in the dish. We shared a lemon meringue tart for dessert and it was not very special. The tart is topped with a layer of s'mores, fresh raspberry and mint. It was too sour for me and if only they made the lemon tart a bit thinner so that I could feel the s'mores. My biggest disappointment is that they don't change the menu at all. It is almost the same as 2 years ago that makes the restaurant boring to go back to. I hope the chef would really change it up, take advantage of the seasonal and local food here and make the menu more diverse and interesting
