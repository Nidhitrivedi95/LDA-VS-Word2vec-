tCSlpwJQ4CZsUEMZeH2SFg I have been wanting to try this place and when I saw the charlotte dealsaver it was a sign that we should try it!  We made reservations for a Sunday morning for brunch.  I'm realllly glad we did.  They were slammed!  We were seated promptly and immediately were brought waters and asked what we wanted to drink.  It was too early for mimosas so we both went for an espresso.  It was yummy.  We both ordered the ham and egg stuffed crepes with some kind of heavenly cheese sauce.  For dessert we ordered beignets.  They were delish but I wish there was a cream dipping sauce instead of the jam.  The service was excellent and the environment was nice.
