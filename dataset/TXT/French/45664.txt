mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q Besides the fact that it was fun to dine next to Jennifer Lopez and Drake in early 2017, L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon (MGM Grand, Las Vegas, Nevada) is a Michelin-star French fine dining establishment with a unique proposition: menu degustation with a modern twist. Most French restaurants around the world which offer menus degustation have an inordinate number of courses on their set degustation menus; the sheer number and size of courses on such menus make it difficult for patrons to finish, and, therefore, enjoy, these delicacies. For example, the neighboring Joel Robuchon offers an old-style French menu degustation which consists of a whopping 16 courses priced at over $400 per person. L'Atelier is a heaven for a discriminating foodie who wants to taste the same delicacies but in tapas-sized portions, with no requirement to order a set number of courses, and save a bit of dough for the tables. Moreover, the atmosphere at L'Atelier is nothing short of hip: patrons can choose whether to sit at the counter and marvel at the chefs preparing the meals right in front of their eyes or position themselves at a table for a more traditional experience. Robuchon's mashed potatoes are to die for (try with truffles!), any appetizer or entrée with foie gras is a must (try the free-range quail stuffed with foie gras), and steak tartar melts in your mouth. After having worked on the French side of Switzerland for three years and having enjoyed Michelin-star French and Swiss cuisine, I was lucky to find this gem of a restaurant upon moving back to the States, and I do not miss a meal there ever since, every time I am in Vegas. Points for service: service is always spectacular, but one time the manager even asked the chef to make a special dessert, just for me, when the restaurant was out of the dessert from the menu that I preferred.
