SBnpT6JDbah-5l_52GM5sw Stunning views, French Bistro interior, delicious food and wine, do you want me to keep going?  A little bit of Paris right in Madison.  If you are looking for a fun and romantic spot, this would be it. 

Service was spectacular and didn't miss a beat, food was presented beautifully and my eyes did not deceive my taste buds or stomach. 

Happy Hour specials were perfect.  White or red house wine (delectable), $3.00 Stella's, oyster specials, sausage plate, warm olives and crusty french bread. 

Sardine Burger was unbelievably delicious and moist. Frites were perfectly seasoned.  Next time I have to get the mussels!
