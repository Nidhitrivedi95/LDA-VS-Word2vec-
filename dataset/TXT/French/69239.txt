w2tr0PA0b3tg8pId0kjM-A I'm starting this review with a rebuke to the other reviewers. 

People do not let the price bring your review down a star! What they charge is what they charge and you are welcome to pay it or not but don't complain about it!

Now to the food! The macarons are diiiivine! I love all the flavors even the unusual ones like earl grey and white chocolate basil. It is impossible to eat just one! They flake and melt in your mouth and the flavors are subtle bursts on your tongue! My favorites are the pistachio, earl grey, raspberry, and rose. I also love that for the holidays they came out with holiday flavors. I've been here a couple times and keep getting distracted by the macarons so I've only ventured to try a chocolate croissant which was pretty good but not amazing. 

The service is always amazing the people behind the counter are always helpful friendly and smiley. The location is great but parking is annoying because it's Forbes Squirrel Hill. I love the window in the store so that you can see the chefs baking if you catch them at the right moment. The store front is very clean and chic and is definitely a presence and welcome addition to the neighborhood. I am so glad the chef behind the desserts of Paris 66 opened this shop!
