O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q my favorite place for breakfast when in vegas. quiet and serene atmosphere and breakfast is great. lox and bagel, plenty for two to share. the omelets are cooked fully with no runny egg and so fluffy that it melts in your mouth. again enough for two to share. crepes are delightful with vanilla fragrance and delicious fillings. their fruit platter is nice to start the day with as well as their pastries basket. their coffee is just fragrant and strong. orange juice is freshly squeezed and very refreshing. my daughters favorite is their turkey hash. their bloody mary cart is delightful as well.
