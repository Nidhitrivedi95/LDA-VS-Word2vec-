f4vb5tv60WaBcwzRhKpANA Nanny's is a hidden gem in the area. There's no fake-American-French food here, it's all genuine. Lunch was simple, authentic, and delightful, from the fresh warm croissants with tangy marmalade to the savory soup du jour. The owner was engaging and loves her work. We will be back for sure!
