xcmmTXhuMx2fZF2Bt69F4w A really great little restaurant in residential Pittsburgh. What I like most about this spot is that it's so versatile. It's great for weekend brunch, it's great for an afternoon glass of beer or wine, it's great for groups, at night it's even a great spot for a date. The only negative is the insane wait times, but they can't really help it if they are popular and successful, can they?

The menu is belgian-inspired Mediterranean and a bit of all-over-the-world light fare fusion. Which is a really neat concept. The prices are down-to-earth, and the food itself is generally delicious, although nothing really stands out as exceptional. Of course, they hit my soft spot, and carry good belgian (and german) beers on tap. The people alongside me at the bar seemed impressed with the wine selection too. 

Overall, Point Brugge Cafe doesn't bring the rustic, old-europe feel of Brugge to Pittsburgh. But it does bring Brugge's modernity and lack of pretentiousness to a town that's obviously eating it up. Literally and figuratively.
