intKyiipUlHDWi_chv0f3A Our first time at Merchant Street Saturday evening.  Michelle our server was personable and attentive.  Thoughtful menu & excellent wine options.  Our meals were well prepared and simply presented.  We had a birthday girl in our party and called ahead to confirm that we could bring our own gluten free cake to serve after dinner.  They accommodated without hesitation and helped out with our little surprise.   I would certainly recommended an evening at Merchant Street.!!
