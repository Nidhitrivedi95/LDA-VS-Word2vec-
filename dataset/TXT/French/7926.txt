4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw For Steakhouse prices, we got TGIFridays food and even worse service.


Impressions did not start off well, as I had made a reservation for 8 people for Sunday at 7pm, but when we arrived, and they had no record of it, despite my having left my credit card number.  (I'm now a bit worried as to who I gave my credit card info to).

Luckily, they were able to get us in about 15 minutes later; however, they never apologized for the mix up.

Comfortably sat, we ordered cocktails.  They seemed to take a while to come out, and when they finally did arrive, the waiter spilled half of my martini on the table and my lap.  "oops" he said, and set the remaining drink in front of me.  We soaked up the alcohol with napkins and he never mentioned it again.

Amidst a general theme of slow yet obtrusive service,  food was okay.  Steak was oversalted, escargot were bland, french onion soup was 3/4 cheese. heck, even the coffee at the end of the meal was poor.

I would not return.
