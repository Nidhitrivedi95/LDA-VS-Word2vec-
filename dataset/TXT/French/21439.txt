B56AYe5GNuavMDtwFsXqzA Frequently travel to Scottsdale for work and found this little gem near the W. Its a quaint little place with outdoor seating. It wasn't very crowded on a Wednesday evening and we were seated right away. 

The service was great and the food was pretty good. Some highlights:

1. Salade Jardinière - very very fresh, a light and delicate salad that tasted like the components were picked that day

2. Gazpacho - also fresh, but slightly tangy and a little too much like tomato sauce

3. Boeuf Tartare - my friend describes this as the perfect portion for an appetizer. She tried it without the egg or anchovies, but was delighted by the well-balanced flavors.

3. Halibut - too salty for my taste, but the fish was cooked well

4. "Create your own...." two of my friends had dietary restrictions - one was vegetarian and the other was vegan. The chef created ad hoc dishes for them, which they both loved! This is neat concept - you can simply say what you like and do not like, and just like that - a customized dish is placed in front of you.

All in all, a wonderful experience in a classy place.
