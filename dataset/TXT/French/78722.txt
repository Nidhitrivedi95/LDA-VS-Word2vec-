ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug I wouldn't recommend this café.  DH had a hankering for beignets.  I asked three people in the restaurant if they had beignets that night, and they said yes.  Then we sit down, order beignets and French onion soup.  The waiter comes back a few minutes later to say that they don't have beignets after all.  The French onion soup was also extremely salty.  I could not eat it.  There are plenty of French cafes on the Strip.  Seek one elsewhere.
