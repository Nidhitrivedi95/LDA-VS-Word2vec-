OkC86YtZ0Nm19my5F4GGrQ When you write a review, the first thing you wanna do is be a jerk to establish your credentials.  So here!  Have two things absolutely WRONG about Tartine Bistro!

1)  The purple potatoes were slightly overdone. 
2)  The medjool dates were actually more of a dessert than an appetizer. 

There.  Have I established myself as A Man Who Knows Fine Cuisine for you?  Will you believe me now when I tell you my tale of good food?  

Call me Ishmael. 

Seriously, though, for a little wine bar/restaurant, the place has excellent food, great service, and an okay atmosphere.  I started with the medjool dates, which were stuffed with goat cheese and topped with bacon in a very light port wine sauce, and they were superb - sweet, just a little flake of crunchy, and finely textured so that you could taste the layers of food within them.

Then I had a wild mushroom and truffle flatbread pizza.  The crust was a tad too crisp, but fortunately the freshness of the cheese and the tastiness of the wild mushrooms (done just right) and the shallots and the cheese made up for it.  I ate the whole thing and then regretted it, for my tummy was full.

I am not a wine person.  I drink beer.  Good beer.  This means I suffer in Cleveland.  But my friends seemed to like the wine, and made yummy noises, even as they thought it was a bit tarter than advertised.  THERE!  ANOTHER THING WRONG WITH TARTINE BISTRO!  +1 TO MY CREDIBILITY SCORE!

In the end, we got the check, and for about $25 per person we'd had a fine meal with appetizer and wine.  That's pretty decent, honestly.  The only serious ding I'd give it is that it was crowded on a Wednesday, which made it a little harder to talk because there were so many people.  Still, considering how many restaurants go out of business, I can't find it in my heart to scorn them for, you know, "having clientele." 

Recommended.  Go forth and medjool date.
