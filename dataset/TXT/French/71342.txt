xcmmTXhuMx2fZF2Bt69F4w A solid 3.5....Point Brugge attempts to bring a cuisine to the Pittsburgh area that I have become quite fond of, Belgian! 
Should I feel bad that I ate the same amount of Frites(fries for the less cultured bunch lol) than the entire table of 3 next to me? Nope! These are freaking great fries. 

Located basically on a Neighborhood corner, parking can be tricky but the restaurants itself has ample seating for intimate or even larger parties. 

For lunch I went with the Point Burger, the soup special, and of course the Frites. Although overall enjoyable, I did see too many flaws to overlook:
- aside from the mules frites, lunch menu doesn't feature enough Belgian classic dishes. It's pretty much Americanized. The dinner menu/brunch menu however, is plentiful 
- the Frites dipping sauce, which is basil mayo, the basil doesn't really come through which makes this essentially mayo
- solid burger with unique ingredients(nueske bacon, shallots, fontina cheese), but no district flavors actually come through 

 Lunch is ok but I'm pretty sure dinner and brunch is where the real action is!
