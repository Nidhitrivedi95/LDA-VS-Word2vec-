4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Ate at Mon Ami Gabi for Dinner. I made the reservation via Yelp/Open Table. We had:

Carafe of "Frangria": sweet, refreshing french version of sangria

Baked Cheese: it was okay. tangy tomato sauce with a soft baked cheese in the middle served with a baguette baked with butter and herbs. It was alright, but should've stuck with the french onion soup.

Bordelaise Steak and Frites: Thin steak that was perfectly prepared medium as requested. Frites were fresh and crispy. 

Bone-in Rib Eye and Frites: Flavorful and tender 22oz steak served with a side of Bernaise sauce. I didn't need the sauce since the steak was so flavorful. Frites were delicious and addicting.

Our dining experience was great. Service was helpful however "quiet. Sorry, no dessert as we were stuffed. I recommend that you try sitting on the patio for the people watching action. Vegas never ceases to amaze with stupid human behavior. Watch the Bellagio water show on the patio too.
