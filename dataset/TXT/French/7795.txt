4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Mon ami gabi was our breakfast restaurant for the next day. We ordered a belini and mimosa in flutes. They were delicious however. .my flute was sticky...and I did not like that. Word of advice to restaurant...after pouring please wipe down flutes! We ordered a smoked salmon eggs Benedict and it was gooood. Definitely shareable. Wish they gave more has browns haha.the atmosphere is nice and feels european. Next time we will try dinner.
