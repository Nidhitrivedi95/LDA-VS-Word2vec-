rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w Great food, attentive service.  3 course prix fixe dinner includes an appetizer, entree and dessert.  Cute dishes with their name on it and the walls of the dining room are adored with circus primates on each screen (monkeys and chimps) with a tent celining. 
If you ask for a window view, you can see the Bellagio fountains.

The amuse bouche was this delicious chopped tartare of fish. 
Hubby paid extra for the authentic Japan-raised Wagyu beef sold by the oz.  He got 5 oz. We both agreed that's one of the best tasting cuts of meat we've ever tried and they cooked it just perfectly.  The outside was seared and crunchy and the meat was very tender. He thought it practically melted in your mouth. I wouldn't go as far as that to say it melted, but it could easily be consumed by someone without teeth and had to gum it.  

I had an appetizer of Yellowtail hamachi, thin slices of fish which was tender and I could've eaten more of it. My entree was a Mediterranean seabass surrounded in a potato crust.  It was good but not something I'd order again.  Dessert was a wonderful milk chocolate souffle'. The souffle' was fluffy and soft served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and cream anglaise.  

Hubby had a very tender foie gras appetizer.  His dessert of lychee ice cream with raspberry was also very good.  They offered 5 different slices/rolls of bread but we tried 3:  French, a great chedder bacon roll and chocolate/coffee which could've been dessert by itself. 

Just really good food and if not for the hefty price tag, I'd eat there every night in Vegas and get really fat.
