oPGUbqBpHNZvVu9gAFJbMQ This was one of those situations where you don't really know what you have signed up for until you arrive at the restaurant.  This is a fine dining establishment (guess I should have read the Yelp reviews a little more carefully) that has a long rich tradition in Vieux Montreal. My wife and I were in Montreal for the Jazz Festival and we did not dress for a fine dining establishment. With that being said we were not made to feel like we will philistines for wearing shorts (we were wearing colored shirts though) so I give the restaurant a lot of credit for that.

We ordered the shrimp cocktail as an appetizer, my wife had the seafood poutine and I had the grilled scallops. These were probably the best scallops I have had in a long time. Before the entree we had two small cups of warm tomato soup. This soup was the best thing we had to eat during our entire trip (and that is really saying something).  As if the amazing food was not enough the service was impeccable (it really can't be beat).

As an added bonus Patrick Stewart came in for dinner just before we left. He sat behind us and did his best to look innocuous.
