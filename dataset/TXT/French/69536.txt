WOd8tWsh2Yt_osHv-ngx_w Horrible attitude... very bad table system. Even if you are only two, but still waiting for your friend or partner, and also even if you are 6.5 month pregnant and blocking the way, they won't sit you until your friend is there. So... what's the point? Piss your customers off? Im still going to take a table for two if I come alone, right? Anyway I thought the magager and host were very rude and not helpful at all. We just left and will never go back.
