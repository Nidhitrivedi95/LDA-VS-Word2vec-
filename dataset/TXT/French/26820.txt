Dcj69NZJnbJhK-YHP_nULA Madison needs more gastropubs, it's true. Brasserie V is here to answer the prayers of the people. Great beer list, amazing and decently priced wines. Best mussels and frittes I have had in ages! Excellent service. And was the perfect setting for a romantic date! I will be back!

I'm getting hungry just thinking about that dinner, it was exceptional.
