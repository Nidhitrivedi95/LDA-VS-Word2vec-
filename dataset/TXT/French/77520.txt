YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g I've been wanting to try Fleur for a while, so when my friends asked me to plan a dinner for our recent Vegas trip, I jumped at the opportunity to book a table here. 

The hubby and I shared two appetizers and one entree between us. We had the croque monsieur and the mac n' cheese followed by the duck entree. Everything was excellent and portioned well for sharing. 

Overall, I loved the ambiance, the dining room and the food was exceptional. I didn't think their prices were horrible for Vegas but as always, be careful when you're in a group. Someone is ALWAYS going to complain that something is too expensive or overpriced. With drinks, food, tax and tip it was under $150 for the two of us. Not bad for a nice Vegas dinner. 

Next time, I'd like to plan on lunch and just sharing an assortment of tapas.
