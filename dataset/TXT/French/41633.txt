kKC7UTcHZM3zLfT97x3msg We went to Frank's to celebrate my mom's birthday. It took a while before the food arrived but we received complimentary fresh peas and amuse-bouche while we were waiting. We shared appetizers and they were really good. My father and my husband both ordered striploin steaks with black truffle shavings and loved them. I had Kobe beef short ribs and my mom had lamb. My mom said that her lamb was a bit dry but my dish tasted incredible. I think Frank's is perfect for small celebrations, the place looks very sophisticated, it is on the pricey side, though. This review should really be 4.5 starts, I went with 4 stars because of slow service even though the place was half full.
