uTCOEqjuVAXUOzti5TWj2Q This restaurant is located in a fancy mall.
I tired the crape with nutella and like it although it was heavy. 
One of friend did not like the food because he thought the crape didn't have an excellent recipe.

Overall, the place did not have the atmosphere for group or couples. The prices for the desert crapes is not reasonable.
Also, the plates, and silverware were plastic, and weren't appropriate for this kind of restaurant. (We did not like the self-serve)

The place worth a try.
