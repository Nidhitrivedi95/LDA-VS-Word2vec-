YUFxSG6idHePsxOmnSHtpQ On 4/9/16 my family and I went in to Mimi's Cafe we were told it would be 5 to ten minutes before we could be seated 25 minutes later we left after they had seated at least five other families. We will never be back nor will anyone we know. Your service is abhorrent and the manager saw us waiting at least three times.
