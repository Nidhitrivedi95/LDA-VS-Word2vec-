aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw Complete your Vegas trip by stopping at Bouchon Bakery--BEST MACARONS BY FAR!

I tried the Vanilla, Chocolate, and Pistachio macarons and every bite of it was EXQUISITE, EXTRAORDINARY, ELEGANT, and EXCELLENT in terms of size, looks, and flavor--you get the point. But man... I'm really impressed. Way to go Thomas Keller!

Also, since we went to Bouchon for breakfast, our receipt entitled us to 15% off at Bouchon Bakery. That was cool but we would have stopped by the Bakery with or without the discount anyways. Nevertheless, if you don't dine at Bouchon, you can still get BUY 5 GET 1 FREE MACARONS.

Looking forward to coming back and also to dining at the French Laundry in the future!
