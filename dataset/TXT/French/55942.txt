rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I've only been here twice for brunch/breakfast but, holy Toledo this place is Fabulous!! Everything we ordered came out right on time and was divine. You can not go wrong with any of their dishes. My one and only complaint is there is a male server with a manbun! Really? I get this is a nasty trend but, it looks extremely tacky and unprofessional for this fine establishment.
