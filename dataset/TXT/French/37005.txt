in3zjiaLpNzr9G3K35gAJQ Another outstanding visit to the Bistro!  Great selection of $14 entrees and nice fixed-price three course with options.  Best. Butternut Squash Soup. Ever! Mussels and fries very flavorful - ask for a spoon for the liquid! The trout was lovely as was the lamb chop entree.  Free dessert! Nice wine list, outstanding service (Jose and Scott!!), nice pricing and a very pleasant atmosphere make this a go-to comfort place for us.
