I ate at this establishment twice and there won't be a third.  With such a french name you'd think french but it's oh so far from that. Food is quite bland in my opinion and the second time both my wife and I had the green apple splatters. Let me also throw in there that the bread had mold. The service was fine though, you get a star for that.
