MxHZ5XwIQWnJFTw9gZxAIg We were accommodated for a Saturday mid-afternoon lunch without reservation. 
Hectic but mindful service welcomed us.  Offered our choice of available table, we were quickly seated.

Ordered off the set lunch menu and had mussels for starters, then the rib-eye and coq au vin.  Fresh mussels in a light flavourful broth were tender to the bite.  Presentation was right on.  First bite of the Coq au vin was properly good.  The sauce was well made, deserving of a traditional dish.  A bit disappointed with the rest of the dish as the latter two drumsticks were overly braised, to a slight burn and dryness.  The steak which was requested rare, looked drab in need of a hotter skillet for its quick sizzle.  But I was told the taste of it was much better than it appeared, and had a good flavour to it.  

Most of the staff were friendly with quick service, albeit with a rush and clamour to it all.  But ambiance and presentation helps this establishment make it a bit more than three stars..3.2?(insert: dry chuckle)
