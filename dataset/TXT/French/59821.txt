sAOgSr6suAE4axjIFSbtLQ Joi de vivre... Culture, communication, conviviality... All this and more nestled in a cozy atmosphere with warm and generous hosts. Incredible you say? Unlikely in this leetle town? Not so, say I. You can see and feel that Alex and Alain love what they do and have that rare magic that compresses time. A short visit and you feel as if you have known them for years. 

As a sommelier, I can say they have a healthy selection of wines that cover everyone's tastes from modest to grandiose. My intentions upon my first visit were simple. Walk in, look around, sample a quick glass of the fruit of the vine and dash... Instead, a metamorphisis occurred. I enjoyed a magnificent three hour conversation that saw a fine Napa Cab put to rest... Do yourself a favor and support a worthy local business. Oh and practice a little of that French you studied so long ago.... Abientot!
