rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw Outstanding brunch. Got the fois gras parfait. Creamy, yummy and it's balance with the gelee was amazing. It came with buttered brioche bread which was a perfect balance of crunchy yet soft. Then I got the famous French onion dip with the accompaniments. I don't even like that soup but this was incredible. Because it was two heavy dishes I opted to not finish them but they were delicious! They both are very rich so I'd rather sample and enjoy than overload. Service was lovely and they give u crunchy French bread with salted butter. So yummy! Great decor. Highly recommend.
