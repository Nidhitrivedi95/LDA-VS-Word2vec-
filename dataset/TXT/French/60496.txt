SBnpT6JDbah-5l_52GM5sw Good service from our waitress, but the bartenders on hand last night were outright rude.  I was guessing that one of the two working the bar was related to the owner(s) because who other than family could keep a job and be so rude to paying customers.  That wasn't just my take, but the feeling of others in my group that ordered at the bar.  Ordering through our waitress was ok, but slow due to volume.  They should staff more than two bartenders, period.  Generally, manners are assumed...teach them some.
