O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q Got the 4 course meal and even though portions are small, you'll be more than satisfied by the end of the meal. Each one of the courses is spaced out a good 5-10 mins till the next and the HALIBUT WAS ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS. (4 stars solely for that) definitely one of the best I have ever had. So flavorful and yummy! The service was kind of slow and also I would suggest having some French music playing in the background to add to the experience. Also portions for the cheese sampler were tiny (kinda laughable) but yummy nonetheless. Overall a classy/relaxed spot for dinner.
