Using the "Room Service" menu provided on the desk in the room we called the front desk to place an order. The young lady who answered was very pleasant and helpful with gathering our information for the order. However, from this point forward things began to decline. First, she told us that using United States Dollars (USD) is a one-to-one ratio. In today's market, $1 (USD) is worth $1.32 Canadian Dollar (CAD). So this information was very troubling that service worked this way to take advantage of the system. I am happy I asked because this information was not originally supplied. After getting off the phone with the front desk my wife and I waited for the delivery of our dinner as we were very hungry. Due to multiple ordeals with Air Canada, we didn't eat for several hours.

After some time we got a phone call from the Front Desk explaining that the "Room Service" is actually a restaurant they partner with to provide meals to the guest. However, on this particular day, the lady at the phone desk was unable to get in contact with the restaurant, Chez Delmo. This restaurant is normally open for dinner between 5:30 PM and 11:00 PM. The front desk lady continued to inform us that she sent someone over to the restaurant to check on why they weren't answering the phone and there was no one there.

At this point, we were already tired from a very lone flight, tired, and hungry. Now we had to add on a longer wait time to eat because Chez Delmo decided to mysteriously close. This was very disappointing that the discovery of this information wasn't found until we ordered something. Perhaps they will decide to stay open tomorrow (Tuesday, June 27th) for dinner but I will update this post throughout the week, hopefully, things get better.
