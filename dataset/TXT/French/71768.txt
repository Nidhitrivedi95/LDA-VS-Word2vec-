I haven't been here in quite some time, but my friend just got back in town and we were looking to catch up and get some dessert.

I had the lemon strawberry crepe and tasted a bit of the sorbet platter. The sorbet tasted almost like the fruit. It was almost like eating the fruit itself. I had just eaten food prior so this was a little bit much. The crepe was good the lemon and white chocolate cream was delicious. It was not too sour, but I think the choice of pairing it with the raspberry sorbet could have been done with something less tart to balance out the dish. The sorbet platter was also good, but the meringues underneath were just a bit too much sugar. There was something clearly missing in that combination.

For $7.50-$8.50 for the crepes and under $7 for the ice cream, this is not that bad. 

What used to be a relatively small and cramped spot has evolved into a much more spacious restaurant.

Being out on the west end, there aren't many options to go for decent dessert. Still, this is a nice spot to go for a crepe or cakes. I'd recommend it for sure.
