JEXasd9XUHFbt_fIdmdK8g Nice dinner last night. The oysters were extremely fresh and delicious. The duck fat pretzel bread was lovely although a tad salty. My friend and I shared the duck breast and the crab dish - both were good. The dessert menu left us wanting, although we did share the lemon crepe/ curd and it was nice.

As for the wait staff, they were friendly although I can't stand it when they say "how are we doing tonight? And calling us his "friends". I teased him about it and he seemed to take it in stride.

They've got that unfortunate problem that many restaurants along that strip have which is that the basement is extremely damp and smells like sewage.

That being said, I'd recommend.
