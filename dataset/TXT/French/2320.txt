0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g I'm very suprised by all of the good reviews on this website. As someone who works in the industry (I'm a General Manager and my husband a chef) we were beyond disappointed with our meals. 

We have dined in Paris at  1-2 and 3 Michelin starred restaurant and wondered how this would stack up. It did not. I can pick restaurants in the US that are far more deserving of stars than this place.  However the food was average, but the service was horrifying! We had a terrible waiter but I must say the back waiter "Jesus" made our experience a lot better. I hope he gets promoted to waiter soon.

Things you wouldn't expect from a place of Michelin Stars: 
1. Ladies chair not being pulled out
2. Wrinkled table linens
3. Butter dish not being refilled with extra bread.
4. Entree being served to the wrong person.
5. The table behind us got an amuse bouche when they were on dessert!
6. Little to no seasoning on the potato and leek soup.
7. When the waiter brought us the bill he had a bic pen inside (now I know what your thinking, how snobby is this chick- but seriously people that can loose you a star)
8.  Waiter forgetting your cocktail order and then me having to cancel it when we got to the dessert coarse. 
9. The wine binder had ripped pages in it that kept falling onto the floor. 
10. The service was so rushed!!! If I am paying over three hundred dollars for a meal- then I own that table for at least 2 hours!
11. The waiters looked panicked and one almost hit me with a tray of food as I was walking to the ladies room. 


I think this is enough said. People who gave this place an excellent review should think about traveling to better places before reviewing.
