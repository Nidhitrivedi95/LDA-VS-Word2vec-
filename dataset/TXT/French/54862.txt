rBOpDqeQl0J_fbDtY-cWxg Perfect place to entertain clients over a quiet brunch.  Large well spaced tables lets itself well to discussing business.  I have only ever had the eggs benedict, they do it well with lettuce salad, fruit and real home fried potatoes.  Presentation is nailed and  the service is flawless, personal and they seem to know when to leave you alone so you can get down to  business with your clients. The only weak link is If you are a coffee lover which I am, I would suggest you skip the coffee at $3.00 per cup, it is anything but gourmet and you will be disappointed.
