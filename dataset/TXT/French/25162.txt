Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA Despite the MiX-ed reviews- sorry for the bad pun- I decided to dine hear because:

1. I was staying at Mandalay Bay and wanted to do something close.
2. I had a $50 off Gift certificate
3. I thought to myself, "well even if the food is so-so like I read, its got a great view and cool decor."

Well I guess since I had lower expectations, I ended up being pretty happy with the experience. First thing I should mention, you really should view MIX as a French-influenced American steakhouse, as opposed to a French restaurant along the lines of Le Cirque. If you look at the menu, you'll notice how similar it is to a classic steakhouse. That said, the food isn't going to be mindblowing, but it is really good, albeit pricey. I love Foie gras, but at $32 for an app, this was the most I ever paid for it...but it was a nice sized portion and it was cooked perfectly. My filet mignon was perfect also, and i needed that after the chewy hangar steak I had at Sage the previous night. Dessert was a passion fruit souffle...again, very good...moist and eggy. 

The service was good, the setting was really cool..it really looks great in there at night with the lights dimmed...and the view was great also, althoguh tough to see because of the reflection on the windows. The elevator ride up is quite an experience also... a glass-enclosed elevator on the outside of theHOTEL giving you a view for the ride all the way up and back down. 

It was worth going to once, especially with the $50 off, but I don't think I'll be returning with all the other places in Vegas to try.
