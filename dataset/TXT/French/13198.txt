4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw YAAAAAAAAAAAAS! This place is so good and, for the view and taste of food, completely worth it! We go here EVERY time we go to Vegas and it hasn't failed us. Definitely worth the pricing and the effort. Make a reservation for the window seat and you'll be able to enjoy the Bellagio show while you eat!
