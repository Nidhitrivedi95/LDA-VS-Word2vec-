4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I had a really hard time letting my gal pal talk me into this location for a late breakfast.  When it comes to breakfast, I'm very simple, and when you stay simple, you can also stay pretty cheap.  Basically, I normally refuse to pay more than $10 for breakfast because the staples (bacon, eggs, toast, etc.) can be gotten pretty cheap at most restaurants.  When I took a look at the menu in advance, I sucked in a breath because yogurt alone was $5.  I perused the rest of the menu, and once we decided to commit, I landed on the bananas foster waffles with caramel sauce.  I cringed a little at the $13.95 price because I was expecting maybe 1-2 small waffles that were going to be "average."  I mean, there's only so much you can do with waffles, right?  Wrong.  There were 5 small waffles stacked on my plate covered with sautéed bananas and a rich - but not too sweet - caramel sauce.  On top of that, they served up a small boat of homemade whipped cream on the side.  Each bite was just as good as the one before.  A bite of perfectly cooked waffle, a slice of banana, swirl it in the caramel, and you're experiencing a perfect taste of waffle perfection.
