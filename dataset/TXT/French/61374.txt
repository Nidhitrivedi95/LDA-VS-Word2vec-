SJo_IjvzdRtCvZVN0cbrRQ Went here for brunch on Sunday morning. Wait wasn't two bad. About 15 minutes for a table for two. I enjoyed a plate of the corned beef hash while my boyfriend ordered the Monte Cristo. Both  dishes were delicious. The fresh fruits were delicious and the pastries are equally amazing. Love the ambiance as well. Highly recommend for a lazy weekend brunch.
