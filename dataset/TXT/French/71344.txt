xcmmTXhuMx2fZF2Bt69F4w Point Brugge was the perfect ending to my first day apartment hunting. It cemented my excitement about my future home. 

Every bite was delightful. My husband and I started with red curry mussels. (What ever you do -- don't miss the mussels!) The sauce was so good that I wanted to ask for a spoon to slurp it down. The main course was perfect too. I got the salmon with mustard sauce and risotto ($22). It was cooked perfectly. My husband got the burger ($9). They went the extra mile with the caramelized onions, thick cut bacon, and fresh bun. Only miss was that they did not come with their fries, but we are glad we spent the extra $5 as they were double fried, crispy, and served with a seasoned aioli. Our meal was perfectly complimented by a light Belgian beer brewed specifically for them.  The bill for the two of us came to ~$100 with tip.

Understandably, we did not make it to dessert. Hopefully we can save more room next time to get a strawberry shortcake. We saw four go by in the hour and wanted so give it a try. And there definitely will be a next time, perhaps we can try the patio seating looking out on the cute neighborhood.
