hvjgF-vnPw2jyL5DBuB0qg made a reservation 1 month in advance... i live in toronto and i know i was going to montreal so wanted to try it out. when we get there they tell us they can't accept minors (we had our baby daughter with us) because of their liquor license, but their other restaurant that also serves alcohol can likely take us. i dont know montreal law, i don't really care, but i think they should have it on their website so people r aware of this rule, so this pretty much killed the experience. The staff was nice but never gave a full explaination of this "rule".
