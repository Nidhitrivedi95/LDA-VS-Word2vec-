QeFsIMcIFIJcOrpthYL8jg I know that the old city isnt known for its food, but I have to be a nay-sayer on this one.  The food was fair to middling at best.  They had a strange menu with some french and some poorly made italian dishes.  We were seated with a nice view upstairs....but we were the only ones up there.
on the bright side, the service was excellent and the calamari was well prepared.  the snapper was fine, but nothing special...something I would prepare at home without planning.   
Highly mediocre.
