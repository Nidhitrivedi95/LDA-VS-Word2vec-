ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug Wow we actually made it for breakfast, be aware like most places in Vegas, this one finishes breakfast at 11am. Food was yummy, but seriously... cool it on the bread!!! Half our table was covered in bread, I love bread but I needed more in my body to last throughout the day and not crash. The baked eggs were good, and so was the chocolate croissant. But next time I know, portions are large, and substitute instantly for veggies or something if you don't want a carb overload, because potato's come with everything.
