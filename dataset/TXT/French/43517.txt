lzwNoKVBC5eJe87151tPSA Located near the Historic San Marcos Country Club in Downtown Chandler, this very laid back, yet fun and funky wine bar is great!
I was only there for a late afternoon lunch and enjoyed some great prices on wine by the glass and some half priced appetizers including skirt steak and calamari.  Our server was very friendly and the place was very comfortable.  We sat in the back on the couch and used the coffee table.  There was no live entertainment and where we were sitting I could imagine the music easily overpowering the ambiance as this place is not that big and there were alot of instruments!  The Little strip mall has some other shops to check out.
4 stars for service, prices and atmosphere.
