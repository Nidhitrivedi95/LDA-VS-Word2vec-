Came for an "end of trip" brunch with my girlfriend this morning. The coffee is still spectacular (the first time I had it was about 7 years ago).  I love how they just keep refilling your cup. Mmm!

I ordered the mushroom and chive omelette with egg whites and added spinach. It was amazing! My girlfriend ordered an omelette as well and really like it.

I love how we were also able to sit right at the edge of their outdoor patio. Perfect place to people-watch, get some gorgeous sites of the Bellagio/its fountain and the rest of the strip, and just enjoy life.

Will definitely come again!
