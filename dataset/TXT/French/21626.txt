bEVWHtBRYVwqaaNF4mWNYg Had Coquine for a dinner cause I was looking for a place that served oysters ! 

I did appreciate the oysters , we ordered about a dozen I believe they were fresh on the half shell with the vinaigrette and fresh horseradish. 

The main dishes we ordered were pasta. One was the squid ink pasta. I was not overly impressed because the pasta again had a weird taste to it as if the seafood wasn't fresh. The squid wasn't cooked properly in some spots. 

The service was alright, our waiter seemed very angry at something. Not sure at what, but seemed impatient to attend to our needs and made it feel like a rushed experience over all. 

I would come back for Oysters for sure, but I wouldn't be ordering anything else on the menu.
