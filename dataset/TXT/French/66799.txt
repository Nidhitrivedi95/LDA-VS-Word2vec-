UpEVdq_euH-5mqCIgUAd2Q One of those places that has survived solely because of its convenient location. I ended up trying this place out because it's close to my condo and one of the few places open for dinner on a Sunday. I wish I hadn't. Service was slooow... It took forever just to order and then they brought our soups first, before realizing they hadn't brought drinks yet. 

I had the gazpacho andaluz which was actually decent and refreshing. But the chicken crepe was dry and flavourless. The crepe was thick and doughy and definitely not made fresh. My friend's fish did not look all that impressive either. 

The wait staff speak fluent French, but other than that, I can't think of anything good to say about this place which is best avoided.
