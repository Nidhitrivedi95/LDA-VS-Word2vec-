4AROFJQ-cgICwLUdgkNhnw Want to stop in and have a quiet coffee? Fancy a delicious little French treat? Even better, do you like friendly service? 

Check off all those for me! I was lured in by the lovely window display. For me, it's the adult equivalent of a child peering into a toy store. I'm powerless to resist the siren song of chocolate and eclaires. 

Once my resolve had (easily) crumbled I ventured in and had a lovely cafe au lait and a treat called a 'Paris best' which resembled a round eclaire filled with hazelnut almond cream. Do I have to tell you it was good? Okay. It was delicious.

Even better, it was quiet and uncrowded when I visited, and the server had a lovely French accent coupled with an easy-going demeanor. Considering the handy location too just at the beginning of princes street, I could see myself returning easily.
