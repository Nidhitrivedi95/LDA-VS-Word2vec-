gCbS0X8w7vZ9CLWvMNXocA My husband and I went here for dinner  upon a friend's recommendation, hopeful for French cuisine as lovely as we'd had in Paris. We were pretty happy with what we got! The french onion soup was heavenly, and our entrees - a salad nicoise and an omelette, were both delicious. The service was great but not disruptive - my husband and I were able to share fairly uninterrupted conversation while having all our dinner related needs met.
