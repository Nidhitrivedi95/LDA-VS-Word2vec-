3jKUbhGSjFTv5jZ0wnW0xA I dined earlier this week for the first time with my family of foodies at Les Deux Gamins.   

We decided to go with the tasting menu, which did not disappoint. To start we had a cream of parsnip & eggplant soup topped with a dollop of creme fraiche. The perfect begining as the temperature had plumeted that day. This was followed by a tomato, bocconcini cheese salad with roasted shallots dressed in a light vinaigrette - very flavourful. The escargots and mushroom dish infused with garlic was complemented with a wedge of puff pastry - a nice touch.  The perfectly cooked filet mignon atop garlic mashed potatoes was accompanied by roasted carrots & broccolini. Dessert was an interesting choice. A dark, dense chocolate (almost fudge-like) cake served on a pool of warmed caramel sauce garnished with popcorn!  Our wonderful meal was capped off with a glass of port.

Our knowledgable waiter recommended some great pairings from their private importation wine list which we found well priced.

During the course of the evening we learned that this was a brand new menu from the brand new Chef. Originally from southern France, and more recently from the reputable Chuck Hughes restaurant Garde Manger. Throughout the evening he ventured from the kitchen to speak with patrons- something you see far too little of in Montreal restaurants.

Aside from updating the menu, we were advised that further improvements/changes are in the works. I feel any & all will add much to this establishment. I look forward to returning to see how the restaurant evolves.
