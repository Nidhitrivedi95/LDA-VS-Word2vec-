I came for a bridal shower. We had a party of 16 and they were kind enough to seat us with 10. The waitress brought our table baguette and butter. The waitress brought us more when we asked! Hooray! The ones brought later were warmer. I couldn't stop filling up on the delicious carbs. 

I got the warm chicken and brie sandwich. It had green apples, caramelized onions and an aioli. The bottom of the sandwich got soggy really quickly. It was alright. It came with some french fries which I didn't even try to finish. They were okay. 

My friend ordered a banana muffin. After one taste, I knew that I had to order one to go. The banana muffin ($3.99) was really good. It was a big muffin, but sort of flat on top. Don't expect very much muffin top, if that's what you're in to. The muffin was moist and the edges were nice and crispy. It did not have any nuts, which is a bummer. There were big chunks of banana in the batter. I would come back just to order the muffin to go.
