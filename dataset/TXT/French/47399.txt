O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q Morels is my favorite upscale restaurant in Vegas.  I eat here every time we come which averages 4-5 times a year.  Over the years I have sampled breakfast, brunch, lunch and dinner.  Everything is delicious.  I would recommend that you visit the restaurant during brunch/happy hour when drinks are buy one get one free and sit at the bar.  The bar staff is excellent!
