Ycp3Agr7dt71TZkeKV7jng I found myself at Le Gourmand after work one day because I was hankering for a good chocolate chip cookie, like any hot-blooded Canadian girl.  After doing some reading online I was a little paranoid that they'd be sold out, but thankfully, they weren't.

I must say, they were very, very good cookies.  But one star off because they were quite burnt and another star off because the middle is a little raw-er than I'd normally like.  I'm one of those weird people who'd rather have a cookie be overbaked than raw, because raw dough skeeves me out.  If the outside of a cookie is burnt and the inside is raw, I think the baker shouldn't try to be overambitious by building up the height of the cookie.  

The cookie base was great.  The ingredients were great quality.  They were generous with the chocolate.  The cookies were massive and, as I mentioned, sky-high.  But I really didn't like that they were burnt.  I ripped off the bottom thirds of my cookies as a result, and for a pricey $3 cookie...that just didn't sit well with me.  

By the way, these cookies are $3 each, which is expensive, but they're also huge, heavy, and filling.  These are definitely made for sharing.

The chocolate chip & walnut cookies were tasty, though I think I prefer the regular chocolate chip.  I would definitely return though, because their other options look appealing and try-worthy!
