This restaurant is truly worth every penny.  Everything from start to finish was amazing.  It was fine dining at one of its best.  Amazing and Fancy!

When I arrived, the host offered to take my coat.  The restaurant brought me a purse hook for my purse.   It hooks on to the table, so you don't have to hold your purse or put your purse behind your back.  The wine menu was on a iPad.  It was very user friendly to use while searching for the type of wine preferred.  The restaurant brought out complimentary individual servings of mini loaf bread with salted and unsalted butter and  little cookies. 

I got the New York Sirloin.  All the pieces of meat were cut the same exact size.  All the sides were cut and disposed of, while only serving the evenly cooked middle pieces.  You know its fancy when the restaurant starts wasting food.  Meat side pieces be gone! The meat was cooked to perfection and the sauce was so tasty.  YUMMMM

The entire dinner was amazing while I had a incredible view of the strip the entire time.

I would recommend this restaurant if you are looking for something new and yummy.

HAPPY TWISTING!!
