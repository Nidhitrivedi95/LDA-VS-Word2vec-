4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw My favorite place to eat in Vegas!  Sit outside on the patio at night with the Bellagio fountains going off.  It feels like Vegas but doesn't.

I usually order the Filet and get a side of Asparagus or a salad.  This most recent visit I tried the Chicken Paillard which was so good.  Great wine list.  

It's always busy!  The trick is to make reservations, which they don't take for the patio cause it's first come first serve, and then when you get there to check in tell them that you are interested in sitting outside if possible.

I've always had great service there whether it be on a hot date or with a group of girlfriends for a birthday.
