xNnZ5ksBY1gwwTV2Btb4Ag I love the food here, and I definitely have brought a few special people here just because I really think this is a gem. My only issue is that for how pricey this place is, the staff aren't always that friendly. My first time there, my partner and I were ignored for the large part of our dinner, and sat waiting to ask for our dessert order for about half an hour. The second time my waiter was much nicer, but overall the service is a toss depending on who is working. BUT, the food is good enough to keep me coming back.
