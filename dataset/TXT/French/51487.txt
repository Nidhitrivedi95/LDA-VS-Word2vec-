My wife's mushroom and cheese risotto was great, I wish I had ordered it. I had the Mussels Portugal and they were good tasting, and generous, but there was so much sauce and they provide no utensils to get the mussels and remove the meat, you have to literally stick your whole hand in a bowl of tomato sauce. No wipes, no bib, just your normal napkin. What a mess. The pizza my son ordered looked real good and he enjoyed it, but about 15% of it was burned from the wood fire. My reason for downgrading the rest of the experience was that we were offered bread and olive oil to hold us off until the food came, and we were later charged for it. It felt really tacky to complain, but hey -- when was the last time you had a restaurant charge you for the little container of bread they place down in front of you before you dine? At The Macaroni Grill, they give you the whole loaf and a bottle of olive oil, and you don't pay a penny, but here I'm forking out a few dollars. Very strange. The service was great, the people who run the place are very nice. I'd like to see them make it and I hope my comments are taken to heart. Please, no surprises. If everyone else gives you free bread, trying to charge for it is a really dumb move.
