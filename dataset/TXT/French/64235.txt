tCSlpwJQ4CZsUEMZeH2SFg I'm going to do a pro & con list to make it as easy as possible to lay out my thoughts about the restaurant. Consider my review more like a 3.5.

Background/Facts:
- I've eaten at Monte more times than I can count. 
- I visit mostly for breakfast and brunch. 
- I've been to Cafe Monte several times for dinner.
- My husband has celiac disease and cannot have any gluten.

I'll do the con first so as to end on a positive note. 
Con:
- Biggest problem is food quality consistency. I tend to find a favorite dish and order it over and over again. Doing things this way makes me aware of any changes made to the dishes (also, simply the poor execution of said dishes). So, for example, I can't help but notice when the English muffins served as part of Monte's Classic Eggs Benedict suddenly become smaller and very hard. I wonder each time I order Eggs Benedict if the poached eggs will be runny as one would expect or hard boiled. I detect when a chef uses way too much onion in the quiche Florentine, and I lament when the quiche is hopelessly soggy. Knowing that the food can be fantastic on the next visit keeps me coming to Monte. I just wish they could tighten things up when it comes to the consistency of ingredients and food/cooking quality.

Pros:
- Beautiful atmosphere. Sun streams in during the mornings, and the restaurant feels romantic at night. The music from French artists adds to the delightful feeling at Monte. I like the furnishing and decor choices whoever designed the space made. It hits on a lot of what Americans expect French cafe dining to feel like, but it does it without being overly Disney-fied. Also, there's usually plenty of parking close by.

- Servers are always friendly, knowledgeable and helpful, which is especially important when dealing with the gluten-free thing. We eat there so much, the employees know us by name or at least face.

- Coffee is always great!

- Great place to take out-of-town guests.

So there you have it. Cafe Monte will remain on my restaurant list in maximum rotation, but I am watching the consistency issue. I hope I am not let down.
