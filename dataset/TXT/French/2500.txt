0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g Im extremely disappointed in the level of service I received at this restaurant.
 At first, I was really excited because I had requested a balcony table in my reservation, so I was happy that they had accommodated us (it was so beautiful to watch the Bellagio fountains during sunset),  however when walking out to the balcony area, the host in front of us didn't hold the door open and it practically closed on my face.
Rude.
But it didn't end there. We had decided that we wanted the filet mignon, which costs $100 or so extra. When ordering, our waitor pointed out the additional cost and straight out asked if we could pay for it.
Excuse me?! 
I don't know what kind of training or experience the staff has here, but I've had better service at a Dennys. 
Well, at least the food was amazing.
