ufwkkMd9yr9cFU1R5ONArg I've been to Huevos at least three times, and everybody has loved their meal each time. I had some hashbrown trouble the first time, but all potatoes have been cooked well in every recent visit since then so I will write that off to a bad potato day.

I had the breakfast burrito twice, and it's one of the best breakfast burritos I've ever had!

If you're near Islington and Lakeshore and looking for either good breakfast food, or mexican-themed snack, drop in and check out the menu!
