rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w Classy restaurant, food quite good, wait  service very good, but meals take quite a while to get out of the kitchen. Grand Marnier soufflé, best we've had. The additional paid for the lobster dish not worth it, lobster a little too rubbery ( having recently returned from a cruise to Maine )
Change of napkins depending on color of clothes ( dark or light), take away chocolate gifts for ladies, nice touches.
 I'd probably try other similar restaurants in Vegas before returning.
