Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA I wanted to have a pre-KA dinner with a great view and great food so I googled "romantic restaurants w/ a view" and this place kept comin up on my search so I decided to go with it and make reservations.

Its on the 64th floor and Id have to say that the panoramic view of Las Vegas is AMAZING (luckily we were seated outside which made it more of an experience), but unfortunately the view is the only thing this restaurant offers and thats why I give it two stars.

For an appetizer, our server recommended the Tender Potato Gnocchi (very good) and I wanted to try their Corn Chowder Cappuccino (eh) and also for starters they gave us a basket of bread- all of which were hard. For our entrees we ordered  Pepper Crusted Bison Tenderloin &  Roasted Chicken w/ a side of Creamed Spinach. The chicken and the creamed spinach tasted like somethin I could make at home and the Bison was alright, nothing too spectacular.

That night there was a wedding dinner reception so all of the servers' attention were focused on them (hey thats fine, you guys got married!) but please also think about the other patrons in the establishment. There were three couples around us who weve overheard complaining of the length of time to get service.

We spent close to $200 for dinner and (bein a high-maintenenace foodwhore that my husband is) money isnt an issue, but weve spent less and have spent more than $200 at other fine-dining restaurants without a view where the food was top-notch and the service was impeccable. 

Even if our meal was free, I would NOT eat here again.

But then again, its just my opinion..
