Bf-yMQiSmDZyqfGyFKQ0bA We stopped in to get a bite to eat after staying three nights on the Waterfront. We had read some reviews but we're kind of leery about stopping in because it kind of looked like a dicey redneck type of bar....
What we experienced was an amazing craft beer selection a very interesting and delicious dinner with fried eggplant with horseradish sauce, a blue dust salad and chicken stir fry....
The pumpkin spice cake with caramel sauce was amazing and so moist and light...our waitress was the baker of this amazing concoction....
I really recommend the Blue Dust!
Never judge a book by its cover....even if it is covered with dust....blue dust
