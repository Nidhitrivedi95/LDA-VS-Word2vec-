kcF-en40P3J9L8nLy5lKqQ In town for the weekend and recommended by friends from back in wa state  to stop in...  We were so glad we did! Everything from the moment we walked in worked wonderfully. Our waitress was phenomenal and sweet  with our kids. The food was EXCELLENT , prices very fair and atmosphere was perfect. You guys need to go. Seriously, you live here. Go. I want one back home Washington!!!! Thanks for a great night CB!
