YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear. I ate at this place two months ago and had a wonderful experience. Small plates (cheese platter, fig flambe) and three white wines by the glass. Wonderful quality and service. Went back there this weekend for Sunday lunch and had two great glasses of absinthe with terrific service from the bartender. Went back two hours later and it was like a different place. Different bartender with a can't-be-bothered attitude, they'd lost the remote so couldn't change channels on the TV (not bothered about that but he was not at all apologetic). Ordered three different bottles of white wines - all out of stock. Not sure if they're running down the stock to save money in a recession but it was a HUGE disappointment considering what I'd had before. Sort it out, Monsieur Keller!
