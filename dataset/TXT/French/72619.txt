XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q I will begrudgingly give Chef Robuchon's namesake restaurant 4 stars...technically I give it 3.5 but will round up. The service and ambience were outstanding..the food was very good...but by no means life changing. I knew going in how much this would cost and I never bitch about price, no one should because we all should be doing our research before going to a Three Star Michelin establishment. What gets me is how miniscule the portions are. I would understand if it was the 16 course Degustation, but I chose the 6 course. I am fine with small portions and am all about quality over quantity, but I was a little taken aback at what I got for $275 (including $35 supplement for three langoustine ravioli that are $75 a la carte). I can't help but feel I paid mainly for that limo ride they include in the price. But it really was a pleasurable meal and we were treated like royalty by a pampering staff (though towards the end of the meal..they failed to fold up my wife's napkin when she went to the restroom- isnt someone supposed to immediately scurry over and do that?) This was are celebratory dinner as we had just gotten married and it was nice, but I was expecting it to be a Top Three meal and I don't even place it in the Top Ten..and for $900..that is a disappointment in my book. I also think the menu plays it safe..nothing reads exciting. I had studied the menu in the past and drooled and some of the dishes listed, but I have come to the conclusion that summer is the worst time to dine in high end establishments. It's more fun dining next door at L' Atelier.
