aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw recently tried their macarons that everyone raved about. The vanilla and coffee ones are absolutely delicious (out of the few other macarons that i've tried). but the chocolate one was really unimpressive, bf thought it tastes like a cheap costco brownie, which i agree. their very attractive carrot cake cookie was not that special either and so are the other pastries. so what makes bouchon above average? they were very generous in providing us cold water (not from the tap) in the middle of this desert and when we had no idea where to get a cheaper bottle of water yet. it's definitely a great place to grab quick snacks/dessert or a cheaper light lunch in vegas.
