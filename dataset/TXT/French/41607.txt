kKC7UTcHZM3zLfT97x3msg I've tried coming here twice before and it was full on a Friday/Sat w/o resos.  Made reservations for a Sunday evening and the restaurant was barely half full.

I had heard great things about their artisan bread and it lived up to expectations.  Came with several pieces with their home made hummus and a stack of warm olives.  It's worth the $1.50 for another order if you're hungry.  We had the lobster ravioli and warm mushroom salad to start.  The salad was very nice if you're a mushroom lover with kind of a slaw on top which helps balance the strong mushroom taste.  Ravioli was one of the best lobster raviolis I've had.  It's also home made with generous chunks of lobster in it and a sweet tomato sauce.

We had the 5 seafood medley and foie gras wrapped elk loin as our mains.  The medley was delicious, but more of a tasting menu portion.  The crabcake and scallop were particularly good.  The elk was absolutely decadent - foie gras + elk (medium) + truffle shavings in a sweet jus...  You cannot go wrong if you are looking to indulge. You get two pieces of foie gras wrapped elk, and one piece of foie gras with a small piece of pasta on it.  The 3-way pork also caught my eye.  For dessert, I had the flourless chocolate cake with a sorbet on top, which was amazing.. I could eat 3 of these!  The sorbet really adds to the taste.

The nicest part was we were given several small tasting dishes compliments of the chef.  I am thinking that this is a regular thing there, but we were given something between all our courses which was a very nice touch.  First was a cheese + potato puree/soup, 2nd was a sorbet type pallet cleanser and the 3rd and possibly the best were the chocolate truffles after our meal.

With some alcohol it was definitely on the pricey end, but Frank's Kitchen is worth every penny for a special occasion.
