It was surprisingly busy (great place for your workday lunch break) and a line to order. Fortunately, we were able to snag a table as well.

I ordered with very friendly Oliver. He makes you feel welcome and as if you're in his home. After I had placed my order and sat down, he brought our food to the table. 

I opted for a Quiche Lorraine with Salad ($7). The quiche was delicious. Definitely one of the better quiches I've had in town. The salad was nice, too.

My only complaint is how busy it can be and especially how difficult it is to get a seat. However, I love the accessibility of tasty French café eats in this area.
