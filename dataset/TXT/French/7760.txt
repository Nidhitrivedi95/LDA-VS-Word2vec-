4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw This restaurant is located in the Paris casino/resort.  Dine on the patio for a nice view of the Bellagio fountains.  We were seated immediately even though we arrived 15 minutes before our reservation time.  The service was excellent and the food was very good.  Great wine selection.  The oysters on the half-shell were served very cold and very fresh.  Select your main and side dish separately.  We ordered creme brulee for dessert; it was wonderful.  I give this restaurant four stars instead of five because the food was very good, but not the best I've ever had.
