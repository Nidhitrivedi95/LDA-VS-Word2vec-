Stopped by for breakfast at 7:45 AM on a Sunday and although we had a reservation through Open Table, we likely didn't need one at that time.

Our son had the waffles, my wife had Crepes, and I had the smoke salmon plate. 

The food was fresh, high quality, and looked great. The taste was above average.

The main reason you'd eat here is for the LOCATION on the strip. Plenty of people watching and you're right in front of the Bellagio Fountains. It also gives you a break from the buffets. 

Although the place is casual, men can't wear tank tops or sleeveless shirts. No problem -- they gave me a plain white shirt (which look far worse in my opinion).

Overall, A MUST to eat at this place when in Vegas!
