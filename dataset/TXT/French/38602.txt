jLxeBgWhLRbII2ACkgH1Sg We came here for our wedding anniversary breakfast.  Only one reason:  Napoleon. We got a Napoleon,  2 choco croissants,  small latte and large cappuccino.  $16.50. Napileon was NOT fresh. Probably, from the day before. Great disappointment. The guy said he'd bring our coffee to the table. 8 am. Only 2 tables occupied.  We wait for over 10 mins, no coffee. I go to the counter. Wait for another 3 mins by counter and when i finally asked for our coffees, turned out it was ready, just waiting for who knows what! So, how can i give more than 3 stars? The place itself is very nice:  good atmosphere, spacious, staff is friendly, choice is OK. But i come for food, right?  Disapointing...
