gh6__q2WXFuyN8gt6VAnWw I was born and raised in Macau, which was once a colony of Portugal. This is the first time I try the authentic Portuguese food, which is kinda different from that in Macau. 
Food is good but lacks some decoration, we ordered the trinchado chicken, chorizo sausage, snails and bacalao Abrass (shredded salted cod patty). 

Trinchado chicken is okay, creamy sauce with chicken cubes and toast, sauce is made from red wine, thick and nice, but the chicken cubes are squared and frozen until used.

Chorizo sausage is maybe the best sausage I have tasted, you have to try it.

Snails is, meh.. I think the snails are froze food, put in an escargot pan and topped with some mediocre cheese, kinda waste of money.

Last is the bacalao Abrass, shredded salted cod mixed with potato to a patty, pan seared and topped with cabbage, nice flavor but the cod should better be smaller, I like my hometown deep fried bacalao ball better. 

Overall a place to try if you are interested in Portuguese food, I can't tell how authentic it is, but it is really different from most of the food you can find in vegas.
