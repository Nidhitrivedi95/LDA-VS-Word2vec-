rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Food - awesome. 
Had ice coffee, fresh squeezed orange juice, eggs, bacon, sausage combo! 

Amazing food. 

Service-wasn't the best.  

Everything up to the end was good.  The bartender was very accommodating. 
Asked for coffee to go with another bartender as I needed to go asap.  Bartender poured the coffee to a plastic cup without giving me the cap or a straw. Had to ask separately for them.  Asked for a cup holder also- said they ran out... Ohh okay...!

I asked if it can be on a to go initially but my first bartender said it can be transferred to a to go cup later. 
Didn't realize that when it would be transferred later ( albeit with another bartender) with the cups only. 

I had to walk this food over to Sands showroom so I needed to transport the drinks and food without any spillage to factor in. 

Fancy restaurant.  Need a fancy customer service regardless how much I've tipped them. 

That's what separates the good restaurants from the bad one.
