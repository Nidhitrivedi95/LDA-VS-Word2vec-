QeFsIMcIFIJcOrpthYL8jg Visiting the lovely city of Montreal for a few days in July 2017 and my bride was a treat.  She had wanted a delicious meal of steak frites without the high price tag.  So we looked at the reviews and chose Modavie...moderately priced French with Steak Frites on the menu.   Well...the steak was subpar at best.  Tough, lower grade cut of meat, not what one would expect.  She ate most of it but I can tell you we wouldn't return based on her meal and the poor delivery of a French "easy" classic.   I had the fish special which was ok...but lacked full flavor, little seasoning or special prep prior to baking so the flavor on a scale of 1-10 was a 3.  Having said all of this, the upside to Modavie was the service...our waiter was terrific...and the quaint lively atmosphere set off by the non-intrusive live entertainment which rotates nightly.  A true delight!  So if it's great food you seek...not so great on our first trip but if you want to linger with a cocktail and listen to some great music and soak it all in...Modavie is the place!
