Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA We were excited about going to Mix because we heard great things about it.  

First off, the host was rather unfriendly as he guided us to our table.  Our waitress seemed too busy to give us attention, although we did see her chatting with other staff members.  When we tried to order a sampler dish, she told us that my wife and I BOTH had to order the dish or else we couldn't have it.  Later on, our friends told us that they were able to order the sampler dish without a problem.

I ordered the sea bass and my wife ordered the halibut.  For 38 and 48 dollars respectively, both fish were slightly overcooked although the flavors were okay.  We are not big eaters, but the filets were so small, there weren't many vegetables (we had to order an additional side of asparagus) and even after dessert and almost 200 dollars later, we were still hungry after our meh dishes.

When we were done, our waitress walked by and dropped the check on our table before we asked for it.  Only after she inspected the generous tip that we still left her did she look up at us and say thank you.  

The quality of the dishes were on par with the buffet at Bellagio.  We would be more than happy to pay for food that's made with attention and flavor, and served with politeness.  However, after this experience, we will not go to Mix again.
