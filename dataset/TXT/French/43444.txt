Just four tables and a long counter in this hole in the wall diner, which prides itself on on traditional Quebecois cuisine served here since 1938.  The feves au lard is the house specialty which is a simple yet rich baked beans dish.  I had the pleasure of talking with the owner Phil who was a wealth of knowledge as to where i should eat next.  To finish off my trip to La Benerie, i had pouding au chomeur, which translates to unemployed bread pudding.  Yummy.  I would say a must stop if you really want the full Montreal experience.
