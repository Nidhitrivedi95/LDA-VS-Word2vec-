4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Really want give four stars but I just can't after my experience. I have lived in Vegas my whole life. Mon Ami Gabbi is one of my favorite places to take my friends when they come into town. From the ambiance to the view you can't go wrong. The crepes are my favorite and I always get the steak tar tar. I've never had a bad meal. Unfortunately I've noticed over the years that service is slipping. This is not an expensive restaurant but it's always a wait to get into but I alway find it worth coming back...

Heres my problem. 

Last time I was there we had THE most obnoxious waiter I've ever encountered in my life. I have ZERO problem with "gay" people and have lots of friends that are. But please, have some professionalism I don't enjoy being called "sweetie" nor do I enjoy the embracing antics and the flamboyance I'd see at a drag show. Please I respect you as a person but you (a man) don't need to be putting lipgloss on as you take my order. Making my guests who are men uncomfortable. Im a woman and I don't think that's appropriate for me to do in that situation either. This person thought that it had something to do with his lifestyle instead of me just finding him personally annoying. I asked the very kind manager to switch my table and even after she did he continued his verbal assault on me. 

After this I really just question the management at Mon Ami for letting him stay there. I say that because as the owner of company with 70+ employees this was by far unwarranted. I've never lost anyone in 3 years to any drama. I just wanted to take my friends to a beautiful QUIET brunch and did not appreciate the SHOW he was putting on. I'll be calling to see if he's working before I return next time because I'm not going let one bad egg ruin my favorite brunch spot.
