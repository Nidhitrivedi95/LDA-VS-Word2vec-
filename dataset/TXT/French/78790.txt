ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug Ate here twice this passed weekend. The hostess left something to be desired. The food was very good for what we were looking for. Both the waiters we had were very attentive and friendly and seemed to really enjoy their jobs. The bus man was also incredibly friendly. We enjoyed sitting on the patio and people watching. The staff at The Paris is overall excellent in comparison to others I have been to. We used our reward points to pay which is a huge bonus.
