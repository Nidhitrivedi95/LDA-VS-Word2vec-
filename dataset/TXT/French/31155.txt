You won't find Crème Basserie if you're just walking along the main roads as it is located along a pedestrian walkway close to Avenue. I didn't really have any expectations when coming to Crème Basserie as I haven't heard of this restaurant and I'm not overly fond of Summerlicious/Winterlicious. However, after eating from the Winterlicious menu and the main menu (we were exceptionally hungry), I have to say I was pleasantly surprised with the food here. 

I ordered the grilled calamari, Cornish hen and the chocolate crepes from the Winterlicious menu. The steak frites entrée was quite small, but feedback was that it tasted nice. 
- Calamari: tasted fresh and was refreshing to finally not have soggy or rubbery squid that you often get elsewhere
- Hen: cooked extremely well, was juicy and the portion was good for a Winterlicious dish
- Chocolate crepe: not the best crepe I've ever had, but it was still pretty good. Probably more impressive than the crème brulee that is another dessert option. 

The pork belly appetizer that we also ordered was melt-in-your-mouth and incredibly flavourful.  

I think this restaurant does well with their Winterlicious menu as it definitely showcases good execution and great ingredients without breaking the bank. "Yay! I'm a fan."
