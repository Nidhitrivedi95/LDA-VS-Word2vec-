FRuuIDOd21pTJHvEGIt1Gg I visited Holder on a recent trip to Montreal. The service was top notch, the waiter was very friendly and accommodating, the crowd was in their mid-20s and the decor was on point. I had the Grilled Hanger Steak with Shallots and House Fries ($23). The steak was a perfect Medium Rare and the portion was adequate. I also had their Apple Cider ($6) however the portion was quite small. Overall an enjoyable experience!
