D87tFO-R6U8f4-e0r4Zq_g Like others have said before me, the owners changed and this location is no longer operated by Veronique. This is reflected on both the quality of the food and the ambiance of the place.

The staff here is not as friendly as Veronique's staff. Two blonde girls were helping the customers as I came in, and both were very cold. I regretted coming in the moment I stepped into the place but didn't want to see rude by stepping right out. The place no longer seemed as cozy as when the old management was here. Crepes were very meh (mine was soggy). For the same price I'll just go to the Bloor location, which is Veronique's new location.
