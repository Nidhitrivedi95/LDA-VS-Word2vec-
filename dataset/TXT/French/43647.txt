m4PW-GMc8JOU5nmMYncu-Q Nice small, speakeasy type of bar. It has amazingly creative drinks (so if that's your thing, you will definitely want to come here). We sat at the bar and enjoyed watching the bartender prepare drinks. Some are quite elaborate!

We had been told that the bartenders do a "fire show", with tossing fire bottles and getting the crowd riled up but apparently that is only on Fri/Sat so be aware. We came on a Sun after Christmas and it was pretty quiet.
