My guy and I came in for dinner and were some of the only folks here who weren't fluently conversing with the owners. We tried several menu items and they were fairly good but unfortunately nothing left us clamoring for more. Perhaps I'm just used to Americanized takes on French dishes though.

The highlight is definitely the homemade bread, which was frequently and cheerfully replenished. The French onion soup is made with a vegetable broth for a more subtle flavor- perhaps serving this in a deeper bowl with thinner crostini would yield more of actual onions, which were meltingly delicious. The escargots and mussels seemed thrown together; the onions and garlic used in both dishes was barely cooked and the sauces did not have a developed flavor. The beef tartare and baked brie were okay, but the execution lacked finesse, like individual ingredients put on a plate together rather than cohesive dishes. My guy said he really liked the contrast of the creme caramel dessert paired with his espresso, and the pricing is very reasonable. We stuck to dishes we're familiar with and were surprised that we weren't more impressed, but will likely be making trips back for lunch tartines or dinner entrees.

The attentive service and beautiful location make this a good date-night spot. They appear to have a happy hour for drink specials, and most other diners were enjoying a glass or bottle of wine. Per management, they will be introducing a brunch menu within the next month!
