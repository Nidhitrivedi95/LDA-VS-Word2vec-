t1mR_Zff6Dqv1TueE2JLEA Food is bland, unauthentic, tasteless....I'm being nice here, my gf says it's crap.

Service was good, friendly waiter, belly dancing was alright but the amount of money we paid for the poor quality food was not justified.

We went with another couple and unfortunately we all were disappointed with the food....don't waste your time unless you like to throw your hard earned money away.
