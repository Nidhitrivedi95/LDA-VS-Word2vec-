fyJAqmweGm8VXnpU4CWGNw Been here three times now and it just keeps being scrumptious.

Tried and would try again:  
Eclairs 
Salted Caramel Macaroon
Chicken Curry Soup
French Onion Soup
Gumbo Andouille
Grilled Cheese with French Onions
Ham Croque-Monsieur
Latte

Highly recommended stop for amazing desserts, espresso, not to mention the tasty soups and sandwiches.  Plus the decor is industrial chic with plenty of tables and the staff extremely friendly.
