O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q A typical Las Vegas spot with great service, excellent food and silly silly silly prices. The French press coffee was fantastic and highly addicting. I had scrambled eggs, hash browns, ham and OJ for 23$. For that price I think a floor show or at least a magician should have performed? The high quality food and service earns it four stars but if you can do without the decor and stylish casino vibe Denny's just down the street can save you $18 bucks.
