8_cTFNIWFiDqBQ8MyorQEA Ma'tine is an industrial-chic restaurant that offers great breakfast and brunch options, in addition to drinks and pastries.  The hubs and I came here for an early brunch, and we were seated right away.  I loved how the chef on-site, Jeremy, grows and makes everything on the premise, including the bread and the preserves.  Our server, Patrick, was unbelievably kind and friendly and made some great suggestions.  We had some grilled buttered bread, that had a lovely crusty exterior, and the choice of jams/spreads (we picked a whipped butter with lemon zest (absolutely delicious!), apple preserve (a lovely pink color), peanut butter, and clementine (my absolute favorite - this was super delicious as it had the right amount of sweetness and citrus-notes for the buttered bread).  We also shared one of their most popular brunch dishes, which was a croissant sandwich that contained sausage, pickled red onions, scallions, a fried egg, and bacon marmalade, with a side of dressed Caesar spinach salad - I wasn't really much of a fan of the sausage nor the bacon marmalade spread, but if it was just with the egg and the scallions, I think it would have been better.  The spinach salad was super delicious, with a tangy zip from the dressing and generously-sliced provolone shavings.  The place itself was cute, hipster-ish, and had some cool decor.  I'd love to come back and try out their other savory/lunch dishes the next time!
