Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA As others have mentioned, "lobster au curry" was good. Service was pleasant. The view was nice. 

Unfortunately, everything else was just OK. For the price, I would not go back again. I kind of wish I hadn't gone. I was expecting something better since I dropped 3 figures on a meal. 

While the food was edible, this place was just meh. Not too much flavor. Not much to remember.... :/  If you want to have an experience to remember, this is not the place.
