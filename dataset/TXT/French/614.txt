-unEKbRspO6OuEaPdmRywg We had our first breakfast here the other morning and were not disappointed.  Vicki had the three egg white omelette and fresh berries while i had the banana and coconut pancakes and berries.  The service was very good, food tasty and well presented.  Definitely one of the nicer hotel breakfasts i have had, up there with the georges v though the dining room is a bit dark for the morning
