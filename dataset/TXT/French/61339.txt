SJo_IjvzdRtCvZVN0cbrRQ Blue Door is expensive, but the old cliche holds true: you get what you pay for. And it's divine. I got the corned-beef hash with sourdough bread and the large French press Honduras coffee. Unlike a lot of diner/cafe spots, they actually bring you fresh cream in a white, porcelain pitcher instead of the cheap plastic creamers. The coffee was smooth and flavorful.
