mnn--vaYHtNyBNYFYBFIog I didn't know anything about this restaurant, as my foodie-friend reserved it during our recent visit from NYC, and I basically just showed up. So imagine my astonishment when it dawned on me that I was enjoying one of the top meals of my life, anywhere in the world.  From champagne tasting at the start, to being served my favourite Macvin du Jura at the end, this was an Experience with a capital E.  

Service was outstanding, too: our server loosened up once he recognised we were a fun bunch, and really made our evening with his understated humour.  Thank you, I will unquestionably dine here again whenever I'm in Montreal.

(I've just read the other reviews and realised Toque has quite the pedigree...)
