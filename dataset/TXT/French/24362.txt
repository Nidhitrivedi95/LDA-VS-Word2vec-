cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg everything is waaaay to rich. we got the duck in the can, the platter appetizer, the melting pot (i believe thats what its called), and one other dish that i think included venison or bison.  the duck meat was good i have to say, but too fatty for me. at the end of the night, everyone at my table agreed one word to describe the food here is: RICH. 

on the other hand, the atmosphere is definitely fun. i'd recommend everyone to visit this place at least once. for me, once is enough.
