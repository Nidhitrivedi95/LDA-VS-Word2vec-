5fquJHY2hMX9tPRD5s0t5g Rooster's food is really good - the wings are awesome. That being said, we were looking forward to planning a small (8 people) surprise birthday celebration for our friend but the experience was less than celebratory. Most restaurants at least make sure to pay extra attention to the birthday girl/boy but in our case, she was the last to even receive her drink. Many of the girls' waters were never refilled. Considering it was a special occasion, there was no special attention or effort made by the restaurant to help celebrate the birthday girl. Usually a restaurant does a dessert or something, but nothing here. Probably wouldn't tell people to go if they're celebrating. Maybe order and pick up - service is better at home.
