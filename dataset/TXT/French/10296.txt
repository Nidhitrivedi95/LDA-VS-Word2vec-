4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw My review is based solely on brunch. I would have to say, if I was to return, I would return for dinner, not brunch. IMO the food is way too heavy for morning or even mid-day. My hubby and I had the french onion soup as recommended by many reviewers on yelp. I found it too cheesy. . . and I am a person that likes cheese. My hubby got corn beef hash which he seemed pretty "meh" about. Not bad, not good. I ordered a tuna melt. It came open faced, with a thick slice of cheese melted on top. The tuna was mixed heavily with olives and olive juice. My first bite was so salty I could feel my face swelling up already. I decided to preserve both the sandwich and the fries for the homeless man sitting outside the restaurant. My appetite for food had vanished and I proceeded to order cocktails. Cocktails were good. Service was great. Ambiance is what gave my review two stars.
