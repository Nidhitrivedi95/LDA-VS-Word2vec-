qmh6zxtJ8C8-YiUPv7ySlw I highly recommend this place if you're looking for a high class establishment .  This is situated inside the Wynn which was totally beautiful with amazing high end shops.  Although I thought the place was a bit overrated and very empty (probably because of the high table minimums) I still loved the restaraunt.  We had a table for 4 at 8 pm and were seated right away.  The service was prompt and friendly with tons of recommendations.  The best part was the cheese cart for me.  I had the moules frites which were a little above par but nothing I'd write home about.  The menu was stacked with so many options I had a hard time choosing one!   There's a cute little show going on outside too while you dine that changes every 30 minutes.
