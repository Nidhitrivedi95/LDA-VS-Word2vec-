It is filled with light (during lunch) and has a warm glow (during dinner). The chef has a light touch with the food. The wine list is both well selected and well priced. In fact, the food is far more reasonably priced than in centre-city restaurants. This is a must stop in Montreal. The menu changes daily, so I won't go on about what to order. Whatever you do choose, I'm sure you'll savor it.
