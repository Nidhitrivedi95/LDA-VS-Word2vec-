jLxeBgWhLRbII2ACkgH1Sg We love La Belle Terre and go frequently. 

The canales are my favorite pastry and the civilized coffee is wonderful break from the usual coffee-in-a-disposable cup orders our country has gotten accustomed to. The paninis and crepes are fantastic. 
The staff is very friendly and prompt. 

They have a lovely patio and the indoor ambiance is very quiant.

It's also a great place to take your mom for lunch or a pastry.

My only criticism (although not worth a lower rating) is that the cold sandwiches are a bit bland so I would suggest the hot options.
