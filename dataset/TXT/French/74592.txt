A $50 sea bass came cold.  Complained and the service was good about getting a new hot one. But overall taste and quality sub par for French.  $75 corkage fee gives you idea of mark up but wouldn't mind if food quality  and taste was better.  Churn and burn the tourists. Don't recommend unless you want to pay for $100+ strip views.
