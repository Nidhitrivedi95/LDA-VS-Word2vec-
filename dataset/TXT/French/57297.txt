rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Best French restaurant in Vegas?

Sunday my wife and I had dinner at Bouchon in the Venetian. Food was absolutely divine. Two notable dishes are the escargot, done our favorite way with the puff pastry cap - this is our go to appetizer and we think it is done best here at Bouchon. The chicken entre is hands down the best chicken any where! Moist and flavorful, apparently the brine and seasoning makes this their signature dish. If you haven't tried this, treat yourself next time.

What puts this rating over the top is the wait staff. Plenty of celebrity chefs in Las Vegas, but the restaurant's people make the experience for the customer. I want to note our waitress, Kayla Maytum, was exceptionally knowledgeable in the food and wines; not pretentious but clearly an expert. Her unique way of personalizing the evening to us made the meal a thoroughly  enjoyable experience. Chef Keller please thank Kayla for us; she reinforces the gem of a restaurant you have at Bouchon.
