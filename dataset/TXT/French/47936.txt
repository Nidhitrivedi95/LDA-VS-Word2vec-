O3OH5IEFMPtz7mPKakPZ3Q The food was EXCELLENT!!I will say the same for the service we received. I will most likely eat there again,but there are a few items I would like them to consider changing. #1- TURN OFF the radio.  The advertisements that blasted through the speakers was a huge distraction. Get a CD with some soft Asian tunes. You have VERY upscale food, the radio cheapens  it. #2- rice should come with all entrees.
Owner/Chef came out to greet customers which was nice. Made the experience more personal I will definitely recommend this place to friends. The presentation of all the food was spectacular!!
