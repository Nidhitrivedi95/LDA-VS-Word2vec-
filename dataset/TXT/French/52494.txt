q0n4I-zqiI47xispOqc1lA I went here with my family for Breakfast. We had a reservation, but had to wait for a table to open up for us, which kind of defeats the purpose of a reservation. A group with the same amount of people was in line in front of us when we entered. They didn't have a reservation and were seated right away at an empty table. That table should have been saved for our reservation instead of given to a walk-in. 

My husband and mother ordered the mocha french toast. I had the Brentwood bagel sandwich. The French toast was drenched in chocolate. It was too much. Way too heavy. The toast was supposed to be infused with espresso, but there wasn't the slightest hint of any coffee-like flavoring. My husband said he tasted some of the toast without the chocolate coating and it was flavorless. This dish had a lot of potential to be amazingly delicious, but it fell flat.

My Brentwood sandwich wasn't nearly as big of a miss as the mocha french toast, but it still was lacking. I got the Everything bagel and the sandwhich description said it was bacon, lettuce, tomato, and avocado. The only complaint I have is that there was barely any avocado. They used mashed avocado instead of slices, and they swiped a nearly undetectable amount on the bread. It was kind of disappointing since I'm a big fan of avocado! With such a weak amount, the sandwich could have really used some mayo or something to help counter the dryness of all the other ingredients. 

Besides the food, the service was a little slow and it took quite a while for our food to come out. They only had two servers working though so I could understand that they may have been a little short staffed. 

Overall, I don't know if I'd visit again. Maybe to try the crepes, but I doubt it.
