3rj1qpgFvkRWtAka17mhEQ My husband and I ate went there for breakfast. We got their Buttermilk pancakes with eggs and sausage and a cup of  not so tasty coffee. We couldn't even eat the pancakes, they were so thick and doughy. We couldn't eat them. The waitress did give us some complimentary croissants which were very delicious. The restaurant is nice and the service was descent, we will probably give it another try.
