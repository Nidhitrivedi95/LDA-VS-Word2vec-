XcWlBj5oQgzKhR7Cxovj3w Good stop for a sit down meal at the airport. Not too loud, like many restaurants today. Decent meal and nice people. A little over priced, like any restaurant in the airport. Only negative was that they seated us next to the servers' stand. No restayrant should seat anyone in that location.
