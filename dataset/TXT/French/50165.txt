ovtlrcsVRlgZZQUlHs_ovw We had the most wonderful dinner at Vogue Bistro to celebrate my husbands birthday.  The Oyster Rockerfeller were absolutely delicious as an appetizer and my husband loved the Duck Confit and the Seared Scallops.  The restaurant brought him his favorite dessert as a special treat.   The staff was extremely attentive and we have to shout a special acknowledgement to our server Laura.  She was terrific.   We will definitely be going back to Vogue Bistro.
