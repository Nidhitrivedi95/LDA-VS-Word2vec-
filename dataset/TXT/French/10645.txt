4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I love their steaks. They are quite yummy. I've also had the prime rib here, it is tasty. Very succulent, moist, and tender. I have also had the crepe during lunch. Great choice. It wasn't too filling and not too light either. 

One time we came here for a bachelorette party/dinner and we had to wait a little longer than our reserved time. The manager felt so bad he gave us 6-8 free appetizers on the house. We ordered all the seafood appetizers. And he was right! Not a cent charged for them! And, they were all quite delicious.

Not a huge fan of the fries... but I'll live by eating other things there :)
