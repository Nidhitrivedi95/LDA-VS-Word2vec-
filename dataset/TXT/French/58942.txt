rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w Le Cirque is a themed restaurant inside of the Bellagio hotel in Las Vegas, the decor is inventive and fun with a mix of circus and modern furnishings. The food 5 star quality, I would highly suggest their truffle pasta, it was literally a masterpiece in it's simplicity. Plain pasta with the slightest hint of oil, covered in thick generous shavings of truffles. $70? Bargain for this kind of culinary delight!
The best thing about this restaurant though? You can literally watch the Bellagio's famous fountain show from your seat while enjoying your meal.

The hungry kitten's tip? Make sure you get a reservation, even on a Thursday night we had trouble. They said they had no tables available, so my partner checked on open table and was able to get a reservation, we walked back in and they actually seated us. Never hurts to try!
