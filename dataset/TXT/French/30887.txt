fyJAqmweGm8VXnpU4CWGNw I was so excited to finally make it over to French Grocery in an effort to quell my homesickness. Unfortunately we were pretty disappointed. Of course it was early in the day but they didn't have any take home entrees ready. The beignets were expensive, small, too thick and burnt.  Maybe they were having an off day and I'll try again some other time. We went home and made gumbo.
