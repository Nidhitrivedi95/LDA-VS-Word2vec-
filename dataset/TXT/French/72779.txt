XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q this is my favorite restaurant in the united states, and it is on par with my favorite trois étoiles restaurants in tokyo and paris.  after dining here, i'm baffled why the french laundry gets so much attention.

it is undoubtedly extremely expensive, and might be somewhat overpriced.  but the dishes made sense, they worked, they displayed an incredible range of flavors and textures, all delicious.  perhaps most surprising, it was the kitchen's skill that really stood out, rather than a generous use of expensive high quality ingredients.  they were able to make really delicious dishes out of basic things (e.g. soybean sprouts, green beans, apple, blood orange, pistachio, chocolate)  and they used the full range of a garden's vegetables throughout the meal.

it has a reputation of being gaudy, but i actually found it to be a well balanced meal, and the many kinds of breads and petit-fours really added something special.

service was perfect.  room is gorgeous.
