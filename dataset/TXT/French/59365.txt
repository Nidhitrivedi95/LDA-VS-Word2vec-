rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w The dining room was elegant, but fun.  The staff was attentive, but not particularily personable.  The highlights were the Sea Bass (best I've ever had) and the Kobe beef.  I was concerned that we were going to leave hungry since the portions are so small and there were only 5 courses (we are used to 10+ courses with tasting menus), but the Kobe was SOOOOOoooooo rich that my wife and I were immediately satiated after splitting the portion of beef (we also split the lamb).  Our experience with Kobe has been "hit or miss", but this was phenomenal.  We don't expect any sort of "value" with high-end dining; but considering we dropped $1200 at Joel Robuchon 2 days prior, this seemed (relatively speaking) to be a pretty good deal!!!
