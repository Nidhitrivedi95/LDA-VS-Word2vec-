It's one thing to go into a new restaurant with the risk of you not enjoying the food, it's another to pay a boatload for said unenjoyable experience. Not only that, but sometimes the food really does just suck, and it's only expensive because it's the 'it' place to be. 

I can proudly say that Daniel B's is not one of those places that will disappoint. It's worth the cash if you want to spring for it. Meals range from 50 to 100 dollars, but the food is exceptional. 

I'm a big fan of pate, and this place had a lot of different ones. I myself had the Duck Tarine, which was awesome. The flavor was strong, but you could really taste the duck without having it hidden behind all the salt and spices. I also had a pumpkin escargo pate combo which was also very very good. 

My main course was the sonoma chicken, but my group had a variety of things so I tried a little bit of everything. The chicken was great. Not dry at all and served with potatoes and shallots, which were all very tasty. Not too salty, and the meat was great. 

The one dish I do recommend (if you're a dainty eater) is the scallops. My friend had them, and the flavor really sits in your mouth. Not the biggest plate on the table, but surely the best tasting. 

The highest mark I would give would be the service. Best service ever. Not only was the waiter very friendly, and gave us honest opinions about his choices of meal, but the staff itself was very catering. It was like every 5 minutes there was someone to top off your drink or water or sweeping your bread crumbs. And they did it in a manner that was discreet, so your conversation would go uninterrupted. Great. 

There are a lot of different places to spend your cash in Vegas, but I would say I'm really glad I spent it here. Not a waste of money at all.
