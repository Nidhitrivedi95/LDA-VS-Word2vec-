EEIz44ewHhOKmfTloAK13g I booked this restaurant 2 months back and finally got to come here for my boyfriend's birthday today.
We had the tasting menu, where we originally walked in without knowing what we would have for dinner.

Overall the food was incredible !!! Every dish was good - this restaurant does not disappoint!! The service was excellent - everyone that works there are super friendly.

They take such good care of your dietary restrictions as well!!

Here is our tasting menu that we had today: 
- potato, sea urchin
- hearts of palm, pear, coconut, finger lime
- choice of ocean trout / hokkaido sea scallop ( sashimi style )
- quebec foie gras
- choice of hamachi or quail ballotine
- choice of St. Canut rack of pork or Beef ribeye
- grapefruit, elderflower, vanilla
- honey crisp apple pie with ice cream
- dark chocolate mint

Everything on this menu was impeccable and definitely worth the money !!

Just keep in mind that this restaurant has a 2 months policy.. make sure you book 2 months in advance as this restaurant is always fully booked !!
