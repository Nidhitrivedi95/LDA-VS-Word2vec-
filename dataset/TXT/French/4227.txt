2gUbgbdJ7IFSbicBXlSchw Decided to go to L'Express today for lunch after wanting to try this place for sometime. The staff were lovely and the restaurant had a really welcoming feel to it. The food was delicious although nothing 'out of this world'. Coffee was nice and I loved the tartelette citron! Dessert was certainly my favourite part.
