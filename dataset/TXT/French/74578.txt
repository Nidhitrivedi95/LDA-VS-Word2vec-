xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g I'll keep this review very brief because I'm sure that everything I want to say has been said already somewhere in the 1500 Yelp reviews.  

This restaurant was simply amazing!!! I ordered the Beef Wellington and it was perfection in every way. 

Service was top notch and our server was attentive but not overly attentive to where it can annoying. 

We had the view right next to the window with a floor to ceiling view of the strip. Beautiful! 

I will definitely be returning on my next trip to Vegas!
