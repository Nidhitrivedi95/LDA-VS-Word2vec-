VwZhwflLnTq19aAeFLJHCQ I Love this restaurant and the owner(s) + management. 

My husband and I had our wedding reception here.  The GM, Hugo, met with us several times to ensure every detail of our special day would be taken care of.  Bernard and his wife are caring and extremely professional.  

FOOD- five stars - we felt like our meals were great, well prepared, good protons.  Wine was well paired to our food.  

Service- outstanding.  The staff was working non stop during the night to ensure that all of the guest were fed and felt comfortable.  

As our night continued onto LaConessa for the after party, Bernard himself assured that our food was well prepared and came on boat to check up on it. 

I am a customer for life.  We LOVE this restaurant.  Best of Lake Las Vegas!!!!
