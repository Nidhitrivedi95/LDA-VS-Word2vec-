mT8Ej8sKFJoIa5G0Vl4AKA In one word: inedible. I generally avoid chain restaurants that feel the need to advertise on television. I didn't want to go but we were meeting some people in the area who were at the Jazz Fest. Unfortunately, this area is largely a black hole for decent places to eat unless you want to venture down to Chinatown.  Because of its convenient location overlooking Place Des Arts, it draws a lot of the tourist/festival crowd and I can only imagine that this is the only way it can stay in business (but that doesn't explain why Baton Rouge is a fairly successful Quebec chain). I've never had worse "cajun" food (fake cajun)  from the appetizer nachos that came accompanied with a vile looking and even worse tasting garlic dip to the rubbery ribs, overcooked steaks, dripping-with-grease sandwiches, and soggy french fries. Alas, the food is so bad, it made me regret passing by the St. Hubert chicken place right down the street (which is bad but not THAT bad). The sad thing is: for the same price you can actually eat at a decent restaurant.
