UxWH8zRYIBgs6Q2oykvRdw A few friends and I dropped in for winterlicious lunch and it was quite nice. Make sure to ask the waiter if you don't know what's in a dish. I ordered something that had "duck confit" in the description but the meal was mostly beans. Delicious beans but not what I expected. Really nice ambiance though.
