Petit Paris is the most authentic French restaurant I've ever visited in Edinburgh!  From the tiny restaurant space, which feels intimate (and occasionally far too hot when it's busy) to the French waiters to the truly authentic menu, it really is like visiting a mini Paris in the inauspicious looking Grassmarket.

The food is excellent: for main course, I had the coq au vin, my companion had the sausage, and for appetiser the terrine and the escargots.  We were blown away by the food - although it is heavy so definitely go hungry!  The wine was also great - recommended by our waiter, whose service was attentive but not overbearing.

In general, highly recommend.  Just be prepared for the heat and intimacy - I promise, the food and service will be well worth it.
