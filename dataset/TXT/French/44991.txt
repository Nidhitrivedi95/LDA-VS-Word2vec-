We had ribs and Amarillo chicken - the ribs were the blandest ribs I've ever had, and my Amarillo chicken tasted like a piece of chicken had been thrown in the oven, with a slice of processed cheese dumped on top. The seasoned vegetables were 3 sprigs of broccoli, 2 pieces of mini corn and 1 carrot stick. The service was helpful where possible, but they had far too many tables to look after to provide real service. We had to flag down the server every time.
