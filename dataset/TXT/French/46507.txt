nKeGPmH5dYNVL5AyAItuKg Went here for my birthday dinner this year. If I had to sum up this restaurant in one word it would be bizarre. I like to think I'm an adventurous eater but I found the flavour combinations and textures of the food I was served at Chantecler to be quite odd. My least favorite dish was the popcorn shrimp. I know it's a popular dish here, but it just didn't do it for me. I'm glad I tried it, it was an interesting experience but I don't feel the need to go back.
