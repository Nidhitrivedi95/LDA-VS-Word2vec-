nkHaix6KenApS8M-liZsCQ Still my favorite happy hour spot. Half priced wines -- a HUGE selection of quality wines from which to choose -- and gourmet quality food. 

While not on the happy hour menu specifically, the mac n cheese remains a deal. It's cheesy but not gooey. The spiral noodles are perfectly cooked. You'll find plenty of pieces of thinly sliced ham. 

The flat breads and burgers are standbys. And, these are among the only sweet potato fries I will eat -- generally, I hate sweet potatoes but the seasoning and texture of these fries is doable. ;)

Save me a seat at the bar!
