O66Zy8Y13VBm72ZDhS4fIg This is a very fancy restaurant where you can spot some of the hollywood stars during the TIFF. Thus I had high expectations. The food is well presented in beautifully arranged dishes, but it was not particularly interesting or tasty. For the price they charge, I was expecting more. The service was attentive, but not as high quality as you expect from a place like this. In sum, you will not have a bad meal or be mistreated, but for the prices they charge you can get much more interesting food and higher quality service in town.
