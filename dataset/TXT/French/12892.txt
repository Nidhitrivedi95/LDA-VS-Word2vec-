4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Went here with my husband and a group (7 total) of his co-workers last Night. We're here on a business trip exhibiting at the MAGIC fashion convention. 

The experience started with a moderately rude waiter, not sure if he was playing the stereotypical "rude French" part or not but it was not a pleasant way to start the evening (Minus 1 star). We were seated at a nice table outside which is definitely a highlight for this restaurant. Bonus that you can watch the Bellagio water show from your table.

 The fresh bread, butter and shredded carrots was delicious and the best part of the meal. The appetizers we ordered were meh... (salmon sashimi, more like ceviche, and the escargot). For entree, we all variations of their steak dishes, all of which came out Luke warm with Luke warm fries (Minus 2 stars).

Overall, a very lackluster experience that I will definitely not want to relive.
