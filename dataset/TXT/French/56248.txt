rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Food: I tried the brioche dore which is their french toast. Be wary that it's not a traditional french toast. It's more like a bread pudding or layered pastry, but it tastes really good. My friend got a veggie omelette which was fine. 

Service: our waitress was a nightmare. She was sooo stressed out and gave that stress to us to enjoy for the rest of the day. She was so rude and impatient when we asked her questions about the menu. They brought us the wrong food first, and then turned out it was for another table. the last straw was when we gave our credit cards to the server and she came back with one. She put all the bill on one card and said she has no idea about the second one. We freaked out. We had a car rental reservation and we already late. She disappeared for 15 minutes and we didnt even know her name. She finally showed up with our card in her hands. Only god knows where she'd dropped it. 

Anyway, the service ruined our experience and the only way I could express my dissatisfaction was a low tip for her and a long note. 

Overall, the place was not worth the $$$ we spent and I will never go back to this place.
