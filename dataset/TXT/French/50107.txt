OVrNItYaf-AWNGgeJA1Tsw We enjoyed the brunch at Cafe CanCan. It's not cheap, but the food is great. I feel like I would have had a better time if I had nothing planned afterward, as service was nonchalant from the time we were seated to when we were paid our bill. We were hoping to check out the back patio, but it was full. Maybe next time! We sat inside, decorations are very girly... my friend who I came with loved the design work. I just came for the food though
