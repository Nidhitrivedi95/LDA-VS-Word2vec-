The staff are professional, helpful and welcoming and you can see the pastry chefs working in the kitchen through the glass window to the back of the shop.  Go early in the day for the best selection - if you go too late in the day you will find yourself out of luck.  Gaby et Jules is a major asset to the Forbes Avenue community.
