IUtjbbqQ6jUSi4t2jjgYRA I wanted to share a totally EXTRAORDINARY dining experience with all of you! On the recommendation of a good friend, four of us tried Cafe Fiorentina at 236 Danforth tonight. They recently expanded to serving dinner. We eat out a lot, and travel a lot, and tonight were blown away at the phenomenal passion, service and food here. The owners are Alex and Tina, and Alex is the chef. Meeting both of them, we love the passion and commitment they have for their business. The sommelier and front-of-house guy last night is from France. He started studying his craft in France at age 14, formally. Lovely menu, or.....we did the 5-course tasting menu...you have the choice of 3, 5 or 7 courses...with wine pairings if you wish. I cannot tell you how exquisite the food was, and how amazing the wines were, one from Prince Edward County. We were amazed. Truly. Apparently this is a place already known for brunches and lunches, but they now do dinners on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays. They have what looks to be an incredible dining experience lined up for Valentine's Day, which they are doing on the 13th. This is a small, intimate place. Do yourselves a favour. If you love innovative, passionate food, try Cafe Fiorentina. I am not affiliated with this business, but am dedicated to local business, and this one deserves your undying love.
