DftK-qzebIR829HozNYfgQ Loic is nothing but a glorified take out joint with over priced over hyped food. They proclaim "the best chicken salad in Toronto"...not hardly. There are many other places offering a better tasting chicken salad for a more reasonable price. Yes, they may be in the price range of Subway but with far fewer ingredients and pre-wrapped in cellophane as if you were buying flowers. Cellophane doesn't seal the sandwich so it's exposed to air after it's made and placed in the cooler. They charged $5 for approximately 100grams of potato salad, which wasn't even enough to cover the bottom of the container...3 bites and it was gone. Avoid this place unless you like paying high prices for low quantity & questionable quality.
