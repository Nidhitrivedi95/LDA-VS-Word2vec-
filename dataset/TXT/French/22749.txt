bzbNGyrTwWHAgg1CqkSgeg The food was excellent as always, service was TERRIBLE. Stopped for brunch.. walked in the door and there were leaves all over the entrance (no biggie wind blowing, its fall).. that mess just carried on into the dining room. There was straw wrappers and a straw on the floor the entier HOUR we were there... tables sat dirty for long periods of time, the table we were sat at was 1/2 wiped off (the 1/2 closest to the end)... our server took our order and NEVER came back... the runner brought the food, I could have used some ketchup but nobody came by to refill drinks or check on us... eventually the server came back to see if we needed anything (we were done eating) and we asked for the check. The staff there appeared young and not very experienced, there were two hostesses and it appeared their job was to clear tables and clean the dining room... our server didnt seem to have a clue wondering around the dining room. We were there an hour due to the slow service... I noticed a lot of other tables sitting and waiting for boxes/checks. Anyways, the food, BF had shrimp and grits which is his usual... excellent as always, I took ONE bite and got a piece of shell, yuck. I had a BEC biscuit which was excellent.. the biscuits were defiantely made in house and super huge fluffy and delishious. It was too bad the service had to put a damper on our otherwise great meal
