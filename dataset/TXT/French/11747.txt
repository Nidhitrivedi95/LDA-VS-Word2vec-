4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw We found Mon Ami Gabi on Yelp and this was one of those meals that lived up to all the good reviews.  We grabbed a cab to get there, but i guess parking could be a challenge since it's in the middle of the strip.   We were there Sunday to celebrate a birthday and the hostess seated us on the patio.  It was a chilly 40°, but there were plenty of heaters to keep us warm.  We had a great view, we could see the dancing fountains of the Bellagio hotel from our table.  

We were seated at 9 p.m., and it was busy for a Sunday night but not crowded.  Our waitress, Assaouir, recommended the soup of the day for an appetizer.  Try the parsnip and pear soup if they have it.  The combination sounds weird, but it was absolutely delicious.  Our entrées were exeptional.  The filet merlot with frittes was tender and flavorful.  The trout was paired with a lemon sauce that was very rich but tasty.  They even brought us a birthday treat after dinner, which was a nice touch.  Overall the ambience and the great meal was worth 5 stars.
