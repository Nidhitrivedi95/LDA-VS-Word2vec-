Since we were staying at the Palazzo, we decided to eat dinner at Morels before heading out for the night. It's nice to be able to get dolled up and arrive at the restaurant without having to take a taxi (especially since it was about 100 degree outside!!). 

We started off with a cheese platter. We told the self proclaimed cheese monger the various cheeses that we liked and he brought out a selection of 6 cheeses that he thought would match our tastes. I actually only liked 1 of the cheeses - it tasted like parmigiano reggiano (LOVE). However, everybody else at my table seemed to love the cheeses. 

As for our entrees, we decided to share multiple dishes, family-style. We ordered the halibut, filet, bone-in ribeye, the linguine special and a side of truffle mac and cheese. My favorites were the linguine and mac and cheese, of course, as I am carb lover extraordinaire. The halibut was well cooked, but lacking in flavor and the steaks were comparable to say.. a Ruth's Chris, with a 20% mark-up.

All in all, good meal with great company. I love how my girls can eat a big steak dinner before going clubbing. That's how we roll.
