gh6__q2WXFuyN8gt6VAnWw Vila Algarve is a newly opened Portugese restaurant close to the strip. The restaurant has a dim lit, intimate vibe which is quite nice. The waitresses seat you when you enter, and the service is very friendly. We usually start off with the Beef Trinchado appetizer.  The cooked beef tastes great, and it comes with toasted bread perfect for dipping because the sauce...is delicious! Practically had us wiping the plate with our fingers. The owner offered some good wine to us as well.

I am a pasta man, so I ordered the Algarve Chicken Pasta. If you are a fan of Fettucini Alfredo dishes, this will be right up your alley. Once again, I was using bread to scoop up all that tasty pasta sauce. My lady ordered the Beef Espetadas. Very yummy pieces of beef sliced, and placed on a skewer. We gobbled it up like m&ms. A very filling dish. Comes with a side of vegetables/fries. To top it off, the owner gave us our first "dessert shots". I forgot the name of the dish but if she mentions it, do not sleep! It is a flavorful mix of mint, alcohol, and deliciousness. Next time I come back to the restaurant I will also like to try the Paella!

As much as I love eating at Vila Algarve, I do have a couple complaints. When it comes to extras, please expect to be charged for everything. This includes water and A1 steak sauce. Last time I was there, we also ran into a small situation where we were told the restaurant does not do split checks for guests. Very disappointing, so unfortunately I say this works best for small groups or if everyone has cash. However these things are minor if you know beforehand, I couldn't recommend this place enough!
