xaqW4NkmUCGRRjmLxiFJ6Q Love this place. Love their vibe as soon as I walked in the store. Although the space is a little bit tight, but having great food and great customer service is all that counts. I got here after dinner on a weekday for dessert, it wasn't busy when I first got there. The later it gets, the more people show up. I ordered the Elvis, it's a dessert crepe made with three simple ingredients, almonds, banana, and nutella. It was the perfect combination. Each ingredients compliment each other very well. And of course, what can go wrong when you have Nutella? The staff are extremely friendly and helpful. They make sure you have the best experience at your visit and they welcome any comments, good and bad.
