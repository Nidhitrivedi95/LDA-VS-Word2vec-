Atmosphere: A very urban take on western, barn-like chic. Comfortable without being too trendy. Bathrooms (located up stairs) were gorgeous (I'm picky like that)...unisex, individual stalls/rooms with a shared marble sink.

Food: We initially went just to have drinks after work, but after checking out the menu of tapas, cheese, oysters, etc...we had to try a couple things. So we ordered 3 tapas dishes to share...smoked salmon chopped and mixed with pecans, mini bison burgers, and ceviche. All were to die for but the salmon in particular was amazing.

Service: It wasn't very busy when we first got there but got really crowded later.  The service didn't change...our waiter was attentive, super helpful (provided recommendations when asked, translated when I needed it, suggested wine to go with out order, etc). Really friendly...and when I wandered trying to find the bathroom (there were no signs), one of the chefs saw me (they make everything out in the open in the mid-back of the restaurant) and pointed out were to go...really nice guy!

Would definitely head back here!
