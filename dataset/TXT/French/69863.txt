WOj8nPos3R9IIf0Pyttd8g Morning brunch here was not in the plans today, more of a unexpected stop to settle our hunger. 

I have to admit pulling into this place gave me that "oh boy another house/restaurant" feeling. (notice my sarcastic joy) so yes i was a bit skeptical to dine here. 

I was very much surprised at how decent the place was inside seeing as how the outside was obscured by trees and even kind of gloomy looking. We were seated immediately and our drink and food order was taken shortly after.
 
Our food having arrived was beyond what i expected. My girlfriend had the Creme Brulee French toast and I had the Madam Croquet  which was exquisite by the way! 

Now for the waitress she was friendly and peppy but seemed like a newbie. I had to ask 3 times for a refill on my coffee instead of her offering me for a top off. 

All in all i rate the LULU at 4 stars for the cleanliness and look, food quality and the friendly atmosphere!
