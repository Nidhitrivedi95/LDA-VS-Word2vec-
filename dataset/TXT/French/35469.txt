htQgj-ANQpZGpIpkkrEmyQ This small restaurant on Markham Main St is a welcome addition!  I have been for both brunch and dinner, but it is often packed so I would definitely suggest making a reservation.  They advertise themselves as a fusion restaurant, and their menu certainly lives up to that claim!  The menu is limited, but delicious.  I had the chicken and waffles.  I was wondering why there were little meringues on my plate and thought it quite odd.  When I tried it with the rest my dish, I found that the sweetness of the meringue paired nicely with the saltiness of the chicken.  My fiance had the burger and it was delicious.  And those fries..yummy!  I will definitely be back.
