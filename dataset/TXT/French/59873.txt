My husband and I were guests 6567 and 6568 at é, and it was the most delicious and entertaining meal we've ever experienced.  Everything from the cocktails to the appetizers to the main courses to the desserts were interesting, beautiful and delicious.  The plating was so intricate and impressive to watch, and the staff were all so friendly and willing to answer questions and tell stories.  

I was a little bit nervous about my nut allergy, which can be challenging at restaurants... but that was unnecessary.  Just be sure to tell them in advance on the questionnaire that they send you, and they go out of their way to accommodate.  I thought perhaps I'd have to miss certain courses or have parts left out of dishes, but no... if there was a dish that they couldn't do right without nuts, they made me a completely different, special, nut free alternative.  Sometimes I felt bad because mine looked even better than everyone else's :)  It was so nice to be able to sit back and relax and know that my allergy was being taken seriously.

I should also mention that we shared one of the drink pairings, and this was fantastic!  Several wine pairings, a beer, and a couple cocktails at the end.  The drinks really highlighted each of the flavors - it was pretty amazing.

Yes, it's expensive... but in my opinion totally worth it.  An intimate and entertaining show and delicious dinner all wrapped in one - such a perfect experience!
