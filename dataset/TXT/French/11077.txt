Let's start from the beginning: it was my friends 21st bday dinner!

Customer service: our waiter was rude about our drinks and just very u invested in our table. His name was Ibrahim. He was ok just didn't care much for us as customers and was rude with my friends drink. Which I did not appreciate at all.

Food: So, I split my steak with my friend and she shared her scallops! 
I had the hanger steak and it was cooked perfectly and sauce/butter they used to cook the steak made it taste so decandant. It was a little sweet but in a good way! The fries that were served with my steak were delicious and crispy! 
The scallops were also very appetizing. They had this cream sauce under them that tasted amazing! The scallops were cooked well and melted in my mouth. 
However, I was very disappointed in my dessert! I LOVE cremé brûlée and caramel! So I ordered the caramel cremé brûlée. When it arrived to the table and I took I bite it was cold.....and it's suppose to be warm....I was so sad.

Atmosphere: it's located inside the Paris hotel, and so I thought it might have a more elegant feeling but it didn't. It was very dim in the restaurant and very crowded! I also went on a rainy day so we couldn't sit outside. Overall it felt very casual.
