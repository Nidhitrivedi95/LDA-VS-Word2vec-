rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A This place was located on the other side of the tower of the 10th floor and boy was I lost when I was taken here.

Atmosphere: a lot of natural light came in since there were a decent number of glass doors and windows, the garden outside was nice

- Spiced Bignet Donuts: really good, better than mini donuts or those donuts you get at the PNE. With this comes the nutella spread or jam...scrape off some of the sugar as it may be too sweet and then spread some jam or nutella.

- Chicken & Waffles: The chicken meat was sooo juicy and tender. Fork a piece of chicken piece and dab it in a bit of gravy sauce...perfecto! The waffles were a mixed batter of bacon and chives....delicious!

- French Toast: not what I expected...it looked like a plate of dessert instead of brunch. This had a layer of cinammon apples which were appetizing. However, the toast wasn't like toast; it tasted more like angel cake. I actually liked the Chicken & Waffles better.

4.5 out of 5 stars!
