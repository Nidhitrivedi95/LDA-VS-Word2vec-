ANHCo9X7zu0LdYecc9fk3Q On my recent travels through terminal 4, I was delighted to see this slightly better option.

Ah, what a welcomed change!  I ordered a croque-monsieur and ate it there seated... the staff was helpful (the guy managing it was very kind and genuine in helping people decide on something).  The food itself was decent and good enough that I'd probably stop here again when in Terminal 4 to give them my business, especially if i'm looking for 'warm' food that isn't a Big Mac or a Pizza Hut pie.
