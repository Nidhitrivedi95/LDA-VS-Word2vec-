jalA5zHW8ZfY3RSPG7oDxQ Noted this and a couple others on this funky but great street in (uptown?...South side?) Pittsburgh.  Decided on this one based on quiet atmosphere and good menu.  Very nice owner and great selections - sit on the back patio!  Had smoked salmon salad and a gazpacho with smoked pepper spiciness to it.  Just enough kick.  My wife had a mushroom soup as we split the salad.  Enjoyed it all.
