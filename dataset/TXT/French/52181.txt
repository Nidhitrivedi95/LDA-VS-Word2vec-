PqLYjUuzSIUU94emDWxwLg I was so sad when Chez Nanou closed, but so happy to see La Kitchenette open in the same space.

The decor is adorable and makes you feel at home (if your home is in the countryside of France and you have a grandmere named Nanick) and the service is very friendly.

I didn't love the croque basque I ordered. It came on just regular-ish wheat bread, was a bit on the soggy side and the flavor combo didn't really meld very well for my taste. But the side salad was really nice with a fresh vinaigrette.

Not a homerun on the first visit, but I will definitely come back.
