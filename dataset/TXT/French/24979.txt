Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA Great place with incredible ambiance and, what a view! The lounge is where I spend most of my time when I visit this place. The overall theme is Champagne and Strawberries. You can see the theme played out between the restaurant and the lounge. The service on both sides is top notch. Yes the food is expensive and portions are a little small, but for a five star french restaurant, what more could you expect? The food is absolutely stellar! 

I have spent a lot of time here and if you can get out onto the patio, you will definitely not be disappointed at all! One of the best angles to view the strip from 64 floors above the street. There is also a very interesting view in the woman's bathroom.... Hope you aren't bashful!
