COgwFthJpS4We16W5Gf4lw I wanted to love this old Vegas restaurant, but it just didn't live up to it's past reputation.  Pros: great service, generous fresh crudités, wonderful bread, nice ambiance, easy parking. Cons: the sauce on my mushroom puff pastry appetizer was almost cold and tasted like it was from a mix.  Oddly, the same sauce was served with the rack of lamb.  The lamb was delicious, but over priced.  The pomme frites were room temperature and would have benefited from an extra minute or two in the fryer. The Belgian chocolate dessert was just ordinary and tasted store bought instead of home made.  Wondered whether the Bordeaux was watered down because it was slightly weak. Overall, a nice evening, but way over priced for so-so food.
