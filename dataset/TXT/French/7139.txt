4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw WOW....This place is definitely worth eating at and definitely worth all 5 stars!!!! First of all ,make reservations its a  busy restaurant. This place is super cute and a cozy gem that feels like your in Paris......The bread and butter they bring in the beginning was SO good. My Fiance and I tried the "BAKED GOAT CHEESE" as an appetizer....OMGGG IT WAS BEYOND AMAZING!!!! MUST TRY!!!!..Then we had the Filet Mignon and steak, Both were definitely tasty and delicious. So we both loved this place and if your thinking of trying this place out, definitely go for it,Totally worth it!!!!!!:)
