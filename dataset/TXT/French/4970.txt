We again ignored the beautiful looking pastries in favor of choosing quiches that come with salads.  My wife went with our usual chevre while I tried the tartiflette, a new menu item introduced since our last visit. Hers was excellent as we have come to expect, but mine (tartiflette cheese, bacon, sauteed onions and red potatoes) would put a smile on Jacques Pepin's face.
