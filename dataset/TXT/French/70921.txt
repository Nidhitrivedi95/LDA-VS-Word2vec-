xBxDMEkFK5GBhiy-8gGE9w We made a point of making a reservation in hopes of getting a table on the terrasse which we were promised on arrival but the manager decided to keep us at the bar and let walk in couples take the spots outside. Disappointing treatment, ruined our experience. Our server was excellent but the management had poor communication skills. The staff was appropriately apologetic.
