4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw How can you beat sitting right on the strip watching the Bellagio fountains while you eat one of the best sandwiches you can get? Well, maybe if the service was just a bit better, it would get the 5-star treatment. It's still great, based on the food and location... but drink refills happen slowly, which is a shame.  Don't get me wrong, I'm still going back (the prime rib sandwich was that amazing)... I just hope the service is a bit more on top of things next time.
