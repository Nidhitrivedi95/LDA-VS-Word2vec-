It's been a long time since I was this disappointed in a restaurant. I made the mistake of suggesting this place to eat at when I was out with my mother last week. We showed up to the place thinking it would be a cheap lunch option, but I did a double take when I saw how pricey the lunch items were. $20 for a sandwich? $25 and up for mains?

The restaurant itself was supposedly renovated fairly recently. If it was, I didn't notice. The place looks like a holdover from the mid-2000s. Sloppy looking seating, plain-looking tables and chairs and no real regard for anything else in particular. The "smart" waitress decided to sit us at a table located right beside the women's washroom. Are you kidding me?

By the time they came to us for drinks, we decided we'd had enough and walked. This is not the type of restaurant that should be charging gourmet rates for crepes and lunch items.

What a disappointment.
