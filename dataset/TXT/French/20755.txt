AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw Checking out of Caesars Palace this morning and stopped for quick breakfast at the patisserie & bistro. Ordered crepes for the family. Cashiers were so ignorant and rude. No customer service. One of the crepes didn't taste right so we took it back. They hesitated to make a new one but they did. When they gave us the new order they called us a liar. If there was a negative star I would've given it to them for their service. First and last time there. Service was not for Caesars Palace but the crepes overall were good.
