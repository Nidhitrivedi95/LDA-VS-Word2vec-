-sSUtare_A_jWarLr3B20A When I went to Nic Pic with a friend it was packed, but a Tim Hortons-ish crowd. It was full but service was still a bit on the slow side, even under the circumstances. 

The food as okay, reasonably cheap. There was nothing to complain about but nothing really of note. The staff was however particularly fast about coming around with coffee pot, and the food arrived at the table quickly. 

Cheap, hit the spot, but not exactly memorable.
