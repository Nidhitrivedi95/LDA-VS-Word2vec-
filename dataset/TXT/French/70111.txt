wwgRu0TAMX8rfRhsiI0ifQ In an attempt to broaden our culinary horizons beyond Aliante Casino and Hotel's buffet and food court, my boyfriend and I visited Bistro 57 to try their happy hour specials. Except, their happy hour is from 4-6pm, which sucks if you work across town and can't zoom here in time. No matter, we ordered from their regular menu instead.

Speaking of the menu, it needs to be more descriptive than it currently is. 

Appetizer - Calamari: The menu describes the calamari as "tossed with spicy peppers. However, our server said it was the marinara sauce that was spicy, and that it could be made it without peppers . The calamari was good, but what was terrible about it was how the excess oil wasn't drained. 

Gourmet Premium Burger: I went bun-less with this and chose brie as my cheese of choice. The patty, which I requested to be cooked at medium-rare, was too thick for my preference. I'm glad that I ordered this protein-style because I had to knife and fork the patty. This also came with a side of soggy potato slices or some sad version of potato chips. Whatever those were, they're not mentioned in the description.

Service: Unlike other Yelpers, we didn't experience slow service, and our server was attentive to our table. 

Overall: I won't be returning. The greasy, mediocre food was unsatisfying.
