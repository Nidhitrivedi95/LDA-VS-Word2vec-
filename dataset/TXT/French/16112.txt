78TC3sZSYBzBsSJ0z5pyhw I really wanted to like Le Provencal, and went there while staying at the Paris without prior Yelping, so wasn't influenced by other reviews...but, my experience was lackluster for the price.  The physical environment is nice, sort of French-Italian country and I was seated quickly at 5:30pm.  The drinks and salad (salad-le-provencal) and bread came quickly.  The salad was ...strange.  The menu didn't mention olives but it had tons, which made the dish very salty, and it was over-drenched with dressing.  Then, there was a looong wait for the entree (Filet Mignon) which was overcooked and lukewarm.  The side (a la carte) of spinach was fine and piping hot.  I'm not sure what the issue is, as the restaurant wasn't that crowded and there was an army of chefs in the kitchen madly cooking away.  There seems to be a consistency and pacing issue here.

The manager came by to ask how everything was and I mentioned the issue with my steak...to her credit she did not bat an eye and offered to get me another one, but I settled on a dessert (tiramisu, which was good) instead and I appreciated the effort.  The service was very good, no complaints there.
