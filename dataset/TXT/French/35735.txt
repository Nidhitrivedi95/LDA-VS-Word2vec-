hvjgF-vnPw2jyL5DBuB0qg Garde Manger is one of the most talked about restaurants in Montreal, and with lots of hype comes high expectations. Service and atmosphere were very good. The restaurant is very cozy, tucked away just off St Paul. 

I split the famous lobster poutine with my friend as an appetizer and had the beef short rib for my main, as recommended by a friend. The food was very good but it was not out of this world considering all the hype. I would definitely return to this fun venue in future.
