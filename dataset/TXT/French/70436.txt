These guys make an effort to greet you, be friendly, help out and anticipate your needs, down to handing out wet naps for the messier orders. Everything's fresh and a pleasure to both see and taste. The hip dance music provides a welcome space in the rather small seating area. All and all a cool find in a rather unassuming location.
