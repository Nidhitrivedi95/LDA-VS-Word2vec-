ufwkkMd9yr9cFU1R5ONArg Looking for a great, casual, small brunch spot? You found it!!
Great funky atmosphere. Mexican music playing in the background. Small seating area - room for approx 34 people - so get here early!
Waffles were amazing!
Mexican Benedict was a winner!
I was missing my family that is living in Mexico, and was looking forward to a great Mexican Breakfast - I got it :)! I personally had the Mexican Breakfast - fresh baguette, tasty chorizo & of course the eggs were done just right. 
They have gluten free options & next time we come, a Michelada is in my future!
