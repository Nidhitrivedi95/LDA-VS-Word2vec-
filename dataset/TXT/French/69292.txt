W6D2egUbZzkMtVfR_wf3QQ I don't know what this place has become but my review will apply to what it once was.

When the Bistro first opened, they had some of the best food, drinks and ambience in Montreal. From their Goat Cheese Filo to their Chicken baguette served with this marmalade chili dressing to their perfectly cooked Steak/frites - it was one of my favorite restaurants in the city.

If I ever return, I would love to go again although it seems like they don't stick to that old menu anymore. Perhaps since their reviews are so terrible, they might want to go back to their roots and figure out what they did well back then. 

Also music, lighting and beautiful server Lydia lol...I can still recall all of it...
