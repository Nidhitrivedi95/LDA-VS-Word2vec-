LHwzyN5cllTfLuZ8v2k_Bg Le Paradis is my favourite brasserie in Toronto! The atmosphere is reminiscent of a typical corner restaurant in Paris, and the desire for such nostalgia is seen in many of the patrons who opt for items such as steak frites or boeuf bourguigonne!

I have not ever really had a bad meal at Paradis, but there are a few items that stand out more than others. The seafood special which often includes branzino is usually on point as are the moules mariniere (PEI muscles in white wine) and steak frites. Though not the most popular item, the veal liver is also prepared quite well at Paradis. As a bonus, the wine list is quite affordable with most bottles ranging between $20-40. 

This is a spot where I would not shy away from dessert and coffee! The creme caramel is quite fantastic and high in demand! Balthazar is also a friend to your sweet tooth and will complement the European flavoured coffee that is served with it! 

Overall, Paradis is an excellent venue to kick back and enjoy some classic French cuisine with friends or family.
