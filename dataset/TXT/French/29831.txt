FJMMPL3pxAPYGEPB0Hwlhw Came here for the sunday brunch for a bridal shower and the service was actually A-MAZING.  Granted it was probably because they automatically charge an 18% tip (I think this is only because we were a bigg party).  Plates were cleared fast, all you can drink Bellini and mimosas were constantly refilled, and they even gave complimentary champagne for the bride to be.

Okay, so I have to admit that the food was not THAT great.  You are paying $100 and really its only worth it if you love lobster tails, shrimp cocktail, oysters and plan to legit drink all you can drink.  They had a cute self serve caesars section and the cups were already rimmed.  The lobster tail and oysters kept running out and you had to wait for it to be refilled.  The hot food was subpar and the selection was small (the chicken and the fish were both dry).  The omelette station was fantastic though, LOVED it!  Most of the pastries were disappointing and didn't even taste that fresh.  The only good one I had was a peach danish.  My fav thing was the french toast.  It was slightly harder than i would like but I just drenched it in maple syrup n covered it in berries, so really I didn't taste much of the toast lol.  Lastly, the dessert area was okayyy.  I had high hopes for this but nothing was really that spectacular, the best thing was the cheesecake which reminded me of cheesecake factory cheesecake. Overall, just not worth the price for me.
