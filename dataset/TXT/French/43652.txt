m4PW-GMc8JOU5nmMYncu-Q I accidentally clicked on a review of this bar searching for ideas on where to go in NDG.  The descriptions, reviews and website of the bar looked so neat that I HAD to go.  I'm very glad I did.  The premise of the bar is ole' timey mixology. The menu is as extensive as it is expensive!  Mixed drinks average at around 13$, and go as high as 28$!  I will warn you though, not only are they worth is, but once you have one, you'll want to try them all.  

The bar itself is beautiful; the doors are draped in red curtains, the bar is the most fully stocked one I've ever seen, the TV flashes anti-prohibition ads and the brick walls just seal the deal.  The blackboard above the bar features daily specials, which are worth trying.  

The bar and wait staff are extremely friendly and helpful.  There's no pretension at all.   The waiters and waitresses are more than happy to answer questions about drinks.  The bar staff practice flair bar tending; depending on when you go, you'll probably see some bottle juggling, spice smashing or maybe even a bit of a fire show!  I got to see all three.  

This is easily my new favorite bar in Montreal.  I'm so glad I found this place!
