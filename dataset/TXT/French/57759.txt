Bouchon's freshly shucked, briny oysters and crispy on the outside, perfectly doughy on the inside baguettes were the highlight of my dinner. The bread reminded me of the cliché yet real image of me buying a warm baguette from a local French boulangerie over lunch and eating it over the course of six meals during my time in France as a poor college student. Unfortunately, the escargots and steak frites were mediocre.

Service was friendly, however, the staff did not seem attentive of the fact that we had a Cirque du Soleil show to attend that evening. The wait time between the wine, appetizers, and entrées was lengthy. Our dining experience from start to finish was over two hours. We made it to the show with minutes to spare.

Lastly, we had our concierge from the Palazzo inform the staff at Bouchon that we were celebrating our anniversary, but nothing was done to commemorate our special occasion.
