t1mR_Zff6Dqv1TueE2JLEA Went on a tuesday with 3 other people... place was nice enough and had proff staff but the food was kinda blah... apps were very blah... the chicken tagine was dry... the braised beef was very good though... but one dish out of 8 isnt great.. (4 apps and 4 mains)... too bad there arnt too many morrocan places in town...
