xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g I've always wanted to eat here all the times I've gone to the Vegas strip and was pleasantly surprised when I was taken there for my birthday!

It was summer and extremely hot (109+ degrees) but slightly more formal attire was recommended.  We were in formal attire but later noticed that some were in business-casual attire.  There were still many in formal attire as well.

The restaurant is located in the Paris Hotel/Casino.  There's an elevator that takes you from the casino lobby to the restaurant located in its "Eiffel Tower."

We made dinner reservations and we got there a bit early so we went to the bar for a cocktail.  I'm not big on alcoholic beverages so I ordered the "Sparkling Passion."  I don't remember but it was a sparkling wine with orange juice and some kind of fruit puree.  It was very good!

This was a few years ago so all I remember about the food was the complimentary cheese bread being probably one of our favorite dishes haha.  Our table had an amazing panoramic view of the Bellagio fountains.  It was really beautiful.  This is a great place to have a romantic dinner.

Apparently, my significant other ordered a surprise delivery but it never got to the restaurant.  The manager at the time was apologetic and tried to make things right for us so we appreciated the good customer service.
