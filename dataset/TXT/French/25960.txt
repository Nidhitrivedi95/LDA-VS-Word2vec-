The  Burrata was decent but not as creamy as other places. The French onion soup has a lot of beef and almost no onion or cheese. Saffron linguini was barely edible- way too spivey and barely any sea food. The side of mushrooms was way too sour but they were kind enough to take that off the bill. 
The molten chocolate cake was really good. Sage is a better bet or maybe we should have just got a burger.
