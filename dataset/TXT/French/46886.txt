nkHaix6KenApS8M-liZsCQ Picked Christopher's for our anniversary dinner and it couldn't have worked out any better.  Our mid week night out was a special treat.  

Had big plans to try some delicious looking entrees, but ended up filling ourselves with a selection of their petit plates.  Mixed pommes, Smoked tuna spoons, crispy pig ears, foie gras, and scallops all delighted us with their fantastic flavors and presentation.  

Jeannie wasn't sure if she could finish it, but she went ahead and ordered the smoked salmon salad and I couldn't resist ordering the clams and frisee salad. Their in house smoked salmon is the best I have ever had!  I was so full, but had to finish the perfectly prepared clams.  Did enjoy my salad as well!

We were too stuffed to order dessert, but were treated to a special chocolate messaged "Happy Anniversary" plate with a scoop of vanilla ice cream sitting in a   delicate edible chocolate flavored cup.  Add to that the sparkler candle, and it was the end to a wonderful meal. 

We were well taken care of at Christopher's and enjoyed every minute we spent there.  Look forward to another visit. Next time we will sit at the bar and watch the chefs work!
