xcmmTXhuMx2fZF2Bt69F4w I was at Point Brugge Cafe for my third visit last night, and I just can't tell you in words how much I love this place.  Of course, that won't stop me from trying.

The menu is on the pricier side (for my budget, anyway, about $22 for an entree on average ... caveat, I did not actually do the math on that), but man, do you get bang for your buck.  The portions are very generous, and the flavor is unbeatable. 

I love it, my choosy parents loved it, my eat-anything husband loves it, you will also love it.

A few words of advice.  

1) Don't eat at the bar if you're looking for a cozy, intimate experience.  This is common sense that probably applies to any restaurant.  I've always held out for a table at the back, and it is worth it.

2) They do not take reservations, and the space is pretty tiny.  Expect to wait as long as an hour for a table when it's busy (which is often).  Good things come to those who wait!  (Side note, at 5:45 p.m. on a Sunday night, the place was busy, but we got a table immediately.)

3) Order the moules.  The classic white wine AND the red curry sauce are both fabulous.  For an entree, GET THE CARBONNADE FLAMANDE.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it.  The beef is tender, the sauce is amazing, it even reheats well for leftovers (and you will have leftovers).

I spent a lovely casual evening with my parents at Point Brugge when they visited from out of town, and I also enjoyed a romantic dinner with my husband there for his birthday a few months ago.  Great place for special occasions or a nicer-than-usual meal.
