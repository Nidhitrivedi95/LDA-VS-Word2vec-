pRlO48w4GkWEPEYIH2tHsw We went in search of a Saturday morning breakfast and landed here. My last few experience here (for dinners) were less than wonderful but I had good memories of the baked goods so thought it would be a good breakfast spot. 
We were early (8:30a) so our service was great, our coffee never ran low. I ordered the crab cake Benedict and was disappointed. The spinach was not seasoned at all and the small drip of hollandaise sauce was lumpy; the seasoned potatoes were bland. My boyfriend ordered the corned beef hash (one of his favorites for breakfast) the corned beef was clearly not fresh-made and came out as a slab of beef. The highlight of our breakfast was the apple streusel muffin that came with his breakfast. It was hot and gooey and we both really liked it. Sadly the muffin and service do not make up for the rest of the mediocre breakfast and we will not be returning.
