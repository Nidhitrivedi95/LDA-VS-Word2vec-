We had the fish and seafood one which was served with 3 different kinds of "edible utensils". We also took a duck one on the side as well because tartare is not that filling. Sole complaint about the food is that the French style really only tastes like Dijon.

Probably best to make a reservation as it is a small place that can get quite busy!
