So its been a couple of weeks since we've come back from Vegas, and the experience resonated with us in both a negative and positive way.  It was a nice dinner but I can't help but still be miffed about one thing - the BRUSQUE hostess!  The young asian girl that manned the front barely made eye contact with us, was so cold, never smiled, and was really good at making you feel unimportant.  We checked in with her for our reservations, and stepped aside about 2 feet away from her to wait as she asked.  A short moment later she was cued that our table was ready she calls out our last name towards the other waiting parties.  I mean really - we're no Brangelina, but didn't she just talk to us a second ago?  With a meager acknowledgement she brisked us away towards our table as we hurriedly followed behind her, barely being able to keep up with her pace.  She just dumped us at our table and she walked away mumbling "Enjoy your meal."  I don't care if she's having a bad night - that's just unexcusable and she should not be doing this job!  Anyway, let's get to the food, which thank gawd, was much better than the welcome wagon.

The Onion Soup Shooter Veloute quickly caught my attention on the menu.

Oh my, this was lovely to the senses as soon as it arrived to our table.  You pour the white creamy soup into these slender sipping glasses that help the wonderful mixed aroma of onion and truffle waft into your nose as you sip.  It was so good that I was worried that there might not be enough, but the huzbeau and I were able to have at least three shots each.

The tender Braised Hamachi rested on top of some very flavorful pickled shiitake mushrooms and the blanket of soy ginger foam on it rounded out each bite perfectly.  It was so light and delicate and I liked it almost as much as the soup. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g?select=PcLlxY661ppzFROMrjho2w

We weren't too hungry, so we decided to share a Pepper Crusted Filet Mignon with a side of Fingerling Potato Puree. We ordered the meat medium rare and although it tasted fine, there were parts of the filet that were chewy.  The potatoes were just ok too.  Both were presented very nicely but they just weren't that notable as I'd hope they'd be. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g?select=V7Ec-Y_rYuYJB_ECfzeVuw

Most reviewers seem to like the Sangria and I'm assuming that they had the red.  We ordered the white, and regrettably it really wasn't that great. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g?select=nFbp8SFThRlQrDp7j2xkAw

At the front of the establishment, the brightly lit patio seating that surrounds the bar doesn't require reservations and is quite misleading as to how the restaurant really looks inside.   The dark interior had a very warm feel with its textured stone walls. The sculptural chandeliers and strategically placed recessed lighting played up the high ceilings very well.  Large parties are seated in well placed coves where they can have good conversation without disrupting those on a romantic date.

It was such a relief that our servers were not cut from the same cloth as the hostess and they were great.  I'd highly recommend a visit here just for the Truffled Onion Soup - but would hope that a friendlier and more professional hostess is working when you go!
