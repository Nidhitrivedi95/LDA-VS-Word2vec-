fRu_POqPowUo6nHSRMjOPw Only came here for drinks but ended up ordering a late dinner. 

Victor is located inside the Le Germain Hotel. It's a very nice venue, the entire hotel itself is pretty sweet, overly packed but can you blame them. It's a wonderful place. Food came out in a timely manner about 20 minutes. 

We first ordered a couple of double shot whiskey on the rocks by the bar then moved along to food. 

Dinner : 
Roasted Branzino ($28) 
It was a beautifully cooked piece of fish with fingerling potatoes, braised kale and lemon pistou. 
Pan-Seared Gnocchi ($20) 
Wonderful vegetarian option with brown butter mushrooms, sage and pecorino cheese, tasted so good, I wish the portion was larger haha
