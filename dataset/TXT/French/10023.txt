4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw MEN!! WEAR A SLEEVED SHIRT! Look, I get it. This place is a very nice restaurant in the indoor seating area and the patio is a fairly nice as well (if you discount the drunks walking the strip while sucking down Smirnoff bottles slurring at people enjoying a nice meal). It just doesn't sit very well with me that because I was wearing a tank top (in the Vegas heat), I was asked to put on a white t-shirt (free of charge) to dine here. Especially when seated directly behind me was a semi-trashily dressed middle aged woman in her BIKINI TOP!  Rant over. Food was good, service was very good. I ordered the eggs benedict, which was tasty. Our server was very prompt to re-fill our coffee and water. I'd like to give the indoor part of the restaurant a shot for dinner. The decor was very nice and seems like it would be a very fine place to dine. Look for a follow-up review on this one.
