7h4nuLjd18da9kg1Qc2rnw We had never been here before but tried it.  We're now loyal customers!  From what I understand, the restaurant was taken over by new owners in February 2010; I don't know what the menu and atmosphere were like before (from some of the reviews back in 2006 I'm going to say not great), but it's FIRST-RATE now!  It's not stuffy or pretentious at all; the waiter was friendly and outgoing, as was the executive chef, who served us our bread and checked in a couple times throughout the meal.

First, a very pretty, relaxing atmosphere, including a piano tucked in the corner (live music starts up again September 15th).  I had the "Fruits de Mur Aux Gratin" and it was fabulous!  Very rich and delicious.  My fiance had the lamb shank and it was equally as good. We also shared the fried calamari as an appetizer, and were not disappointed.  The restaurant wasn't crowded at all, which is beyond me because I think this place was exceptional, and very fairly priced for the caliber of food and service we received.  Maybe a throwback of previous owners? Or not quite season yet?  Either way, I say GO TRY THIS PLACE and tell your friends.  It's a jewel in North Scottsdale and a must-visit place!
