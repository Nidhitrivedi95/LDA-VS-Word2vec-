JezHN-9KKLTMbojq00VP0g This is one of those places that I really want to like but have never had a superb experience. I have visited twice now and both times the service was terrible. There always seems to be enough wait staff so it is hard to figure out why they seem to be disorderly with service. It took about 10 minutes just to get a glass of water. Once you get your food, no one checks on you again until you are finished. This time around the friends I was with were served cold potatoes. It was probably due to the fact that we saw our food sit on the counter for awhile while we waited for our server to finally see it and serve it to us. We almost wanted to get up and get the food ourselves. The food itself is okay but nothing that I will miss.
