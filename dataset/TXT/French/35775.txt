hvjgF-vnPw2jyL5DBuB0qg My better or best dinning experience in Montreal, Located in old city...  We sat at the bar for dinner which we booked 5 days in advance, cause the rest of the place had been booked for months as its so popular, which was a treat in its self as we got more attention. The room is small but full of hip beautiful energy... the service is top notch and the menu was even better, and of course had the lobster poutine which for the price is worth it...
