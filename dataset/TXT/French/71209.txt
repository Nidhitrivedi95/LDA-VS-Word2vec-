xcmmTXhuMx2fZF2Bt69F4w I finally made it! After millions of people telling me to try Point Brugge, I finally had off on a Sunday off to enjoy their famous brunch! I must say, the hype is real!

The place is small and definitely better suited for more intimate parties (not the party of nine we had). However, the staff was super accommodating and allowed us to push some tables together. These small places are always the best. Good things come in small packages! 

I got the breakfast special that included waffles topped with strawberries, bacon and mimosa. The price is a steep $22, but the food was oh so good! You didn't even need syrup or anything to sweeten the waffle, it was that good! The bacon was thick cut bacon as well-- yum! 

This is definitely a cute summer spot as they open the windows and have outdoor seating. I would love to come back and try their lunch options.
