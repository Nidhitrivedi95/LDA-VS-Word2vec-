This place is adorable.!
Arrive early, there tends to be a line...but it's worth it. 
Better than typical breakfast fare.  The pastries were  fresh and the meals were creative.
The neighbourhood is still up and coming, but there are some cute shops around if you're having a slow Sunday in the city!
