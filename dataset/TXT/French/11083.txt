4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I made a reservation on opentable.com before we got there.  Total lifesaver.  The line was WELL out the door when we arrived for our 6:30pm reservation.  We were sat inside, the patio was full.  

*Warm Olive Jar- $6.95- delish!  The olives had so much flavor and I used the garlic on the bread!

*Shrimp Cocktail- $14.95- a little pricy but they were 3 bite shrimp...they were HUGE

*French Onion Soup- $8.95- not as salty as I thought it was going to be.  Very good.

*Filet with Merlot Sauce- $32.95- melt in your mouth delicious.  I was super bummed when it was gone.

*Fries- A little odd but they were very good soaked in the merlot sauce.

Very Very Very good.  The service here is excellent and the bread is to die for.  Will be back next time I'm in Vegas.
