qrSsS0pk7SL67MP5nN8tlg Think Auberge de Pommier without the crazy price tag.  Over the years i still can't understand why this place hasn't received the kudos it deserves.  My wife and i frequent this place often and every experience reminds us of a brief getaway to Europe with great food and wonderful service. Make sure you try the French onion soup, mussels and tenderloin for a wonderful experience - although you really can't go wrong with anything else.  Very reasonably priced, tucked away in an obscure part of town and never really received the credit it deserves.  Price for two with wine, tax and tip came in at ~$160.
