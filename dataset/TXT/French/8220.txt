4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw My friends and I were starving so we trekked to Mon Ami Gabi for Sunday brunch. There was a 30-40 minute wait for the patio but no line to dine inside. We didn't mind sitting inside. It's elegant and not as dark once your eyes adjust to the lighting. Our waitress was attentive and was able to help us choose our dishes. We all thoroughly enjoyed our food but I think my grilled salmon salad was the best pick. I think we were in and out in less than an hour. Perfect!
