dd3GZs6zW2t7BM0cbxAzvg What an amazing brunch! I tried the eggs Benedict with wild boar, it was perfect. Wife went with the croissant with halibut, she says she could eat another one so good it was. They also have the amazing Dieu du Ciel! beer, only those are worth the visit. A gem in Toronto fashion district.
