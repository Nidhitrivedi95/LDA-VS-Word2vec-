cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg No! No! No! I though I was going to die after eating such rich food. 
We had:
1) the poutine (just the right amount of sauce).
2) A PDC Pork Chop (truly with a huge, caveman-like bone) with a divine sliced red cabbage sauce.
3) Duck Magret heaped generously with mushrooms

Wine selection was a terrific cotes du rhone which was full-bodied and just a little bit of acidity to keep it tasting fresh.

This is not "fine dining" but rather a celebration of robust, complex flavors. Quite frankly I prefer it that way. 

After leaving this restaurant my face started flushing, either of happiness or because my blood pressure rose from all the rich butter and gravy in my system--I'd like to think it was the former
