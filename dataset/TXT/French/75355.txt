yAkT-tNGut0rbWlA7kjrdg Oh. My. Word. Amazing cakes. After uhm-ing & aw-ing over the choice, I finally settled for the white chocolate & raspberry eclair to have with a cheeky hot chocolate and it was deliciousness personified.

The raspberries tasted like they had just been picked that morning: juicy & sweet & full of flavour. The patisserie vanilla cream filling was light & not too sweet and there was lovely layer of raspberry confit which added flavour. The pastry was light and the white chocolate was delicately flavoured with vanilla. Portion wise - it was the perfect portion. I could've eaten another one but maybe that's because I love cake and could eat it all day every day if I had a chance.

The hot chocolate was made with proper chocolate shavings and was a rich satisfying milk/dark blend. It wasn't sweet at all. 

After a few disappointing trips to a rival patisserie, this is a firm favourite and well worth the trip down to Stockbridge. What's more it must be some sort of well kept secret because, despite the time of day/week (1.30 on a Saturday afternoon), it wasn't even half full!! I'm sure with word of mouth that will change but I enjoyed the fact the staff had time to chat & I could sit and watch the world go by without feeling I had to give up my table.
