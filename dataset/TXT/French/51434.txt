P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ I'd read a lot about Guy Savoy's Menu Prestige (the $290, 10 course, 3-4 hour tasting menu) before our trip to Vegas. I don't know why, but I didn't expect the level of impeccability and perfection that they brought... course after course after delicious course. My immediate reaction was I need to win the lottery immediately for any other meal would now pale in comparison.
