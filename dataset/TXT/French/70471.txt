xaqW4NkmUCGRRjmLxiFJ6Q I was traveling in Markham from Texas. Had NO idea where I wanted to go for lunch. Did a Yelp search and this place came up. Now, I love crepes. The fact that the reviews were a unanimous 5 stars, I had to check it out. I ordered the Moroccan, which is the falafel crepe. It was delicious. Fantastic even. I wish I had the opportunity to check out the other flavors. I highly recommend this crepe joint. 

Also, the people working there were incredibly friendly.
