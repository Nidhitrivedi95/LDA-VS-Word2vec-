hvjgF-vnPw2jyL5DBuB0qg This is one of the best restaurants I've been to in a long time (and I live in San Francisco & New York which have amazing restaurants). The atmosphere is warm & cozy, and the service is impeccable. Everyone that works there have great personalities and it is evident that they all "really" like their job and not just after a tip. 

We had the seared duck & spicy lobster. The duck was HANDS DOWN the best I have ever tasted and the lobster was incredible with fresh herbs, smoked jalopenos, lemongrass & ginger. Both of the dishes will be remembered by my husband and I forever! It was truly amazing. 

For a cocktail = get the extra large "Bloody Ceasar" that has a crab leg in it!

This restaurant created an amazing night for us and will go down as one of our favorites of all time. I HIGHLY recommend trying it!
