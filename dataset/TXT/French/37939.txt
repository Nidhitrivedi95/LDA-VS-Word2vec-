jaSowNITPRRCYpPb3_pjdA The original Andre's was one of Las Vegas's iconic fine dining French restaurants.
It's was a pleasure to see that they were able to keep the feel of that dining experience and the wonderful food and apply it to this bistro.
The food was still wonderful, the atmosphere was nice and relaxed, and the location makes it easy.
