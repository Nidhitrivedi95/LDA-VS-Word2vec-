tCSlpwJQ4CZsUEMZeH2SFg Great french restaurant in SouthPark (in the building next to Whole Foods)! I was in town due to Hurricane Irma and staying in the new Homewood Suites hotel across the street. 

The location is great with plenty of parking. They have outdoor seating as well for the beautiful weather lately. I came in early Saturday and it was definitely busy with a 45 minute wait. Thankfully, the bar seating is first come first serve and there were two seats available. 

The service was excellent and the food was just amazing. I had a delicious almond latte and mimosas with my meal. We ordered the rib sandwich and baguette with various butter and jam. Everything was so good! I came in a few days later and also tried the waffle and fresh berries. It was great! 

There are so many great selections! This is a great place for brunch, business meetings, or just some time to catch-up with family and friends. I look forward to visiting again!
