eDtBCZDo92LqBCIfE45hhg We stumbled upon this restaurant while looking for a place to eat in Old Montreal.  As soon as I saw the cute outdoor seating, I knew this was the place!

The decor is absolutely beautiful, outdoor seating with wrought iron railings, plants and beautiful ambient lighting.

The food was delicious!  We had beef tongue to start and the steak and duck for entrees.  Everything was cooked and seasoned perfectly.  For desert we had the macarons which were on the smaller side but still very tasty.

Overall, a great dining experience.
