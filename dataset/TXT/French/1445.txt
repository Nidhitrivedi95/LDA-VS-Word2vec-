_T7f2wUgNlJqxsR-cR89SQ Food - excellent, service - excellent, ambiance - excellent. Scaramouche deserves no less than 5 stars and justifies its position in Toronto's top restaurants. 

The food is perfectly executed from beginning to end and there's not much to fault in any of the dishes. You can taste the layers in the sauces and the effort that was put into every plate. 

Notable highlights: (apps) grilled octopus and duck gnocchi; (entrees) lamb, partridge and venison; (desserts) coconut cream pie, rhubarb and cream puff. Note the menu does change from time to time, but the restaurant favourites - lamb, filet mignon and coconut pie (and potentially others) - should be always on the menu. 

The service is on point and the view that you have of the Toronto skyline is a treat for those who may be coming in from out of town. 

If you're looking for a special restaurant to spend your evening with spectacular food, come to Scaramouche. The food, service and view of the city well make up for the 'interesting' basement location.
