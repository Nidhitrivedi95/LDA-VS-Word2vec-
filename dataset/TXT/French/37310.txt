IYreMhkT6e02tsbw-Dex5Q We had lunch there and waited almost an hour for our entree even though we were one of the first in the door. The decor and seating area is lovely but our food was late and extremely dry. The chicken roti main course was a dry airlines breast with some salad leaves, it was inedible. We complained about service and food and were told it was too bad. Where was a manager?
