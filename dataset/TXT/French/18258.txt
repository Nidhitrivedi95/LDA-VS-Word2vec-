A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g The food is absolutely so of the best I have ever had.  I built my own sandwich, which included ham, turkey, lettuce, tomato, pickles, onion, olives on a Croissant and bowl of the tomato soup.   I really enjoyed the soup and sandwich and would recommend it to everyone to try.  

Some of the downers were the ice tea was horrible, the service was marginal at best and there was a family eating next to us the parents did nothing to control their children from running around and disturbing the tables around them.   The kids climbed on chairs and went through the candy racks with the little tongs with their hands, it was disgusting to watch them touch all the candy.

Staff ignored all this and it was very very unpleasant for the people sitting around them.

I gave them four stars just on the food a lone!
