For entrees, we chose the Kit of Three - sashimi-style bass, albacore and salmon served in three different dressing - salty, citric and sweet. Delicious first course which opens up your tastebuds. Portions in this dish are small, but can still be share among two people and get room to try another entree. 

Second entree we ordered is the Octopus. Well cooked and a good complement to our first choice. Not as amazing as the Kit of Three. 

For main course, I had the Linguini, speck, almonds, cauliflower and truffle brunoise. This dish is amazingly delicious with its mixed of flavours. A must try I would say. 

My friend tried the Bucatini, pork flank confit black garly and soy. This is good, but very fatty - 80% of the piece of meat is fat. 

Practically full from the previous dish, we ordered a lighter dessert of Dacquoise, lemon, kumquat, creme fraiche and white chocolate. This is not too heavy so it ended well our meal.
