htQgj-ANQpZGpIpkkrEmyQ I had heard amazing things about Inspire before coming, and I am very happy to say that I was not disappointed - in fact, Inspire exceeded my expectations tenfold. 

I had a difficult time with their menu because so many of the items looked AMAZING. I don't know if I've ever had such a tough time choosing an entree at a restaurant. I ended up deciding on the Chicken and waffles, since I have yet to try this popular dish at any restaurant up to now, and it was exceptional. The fresh fruit, mango edamame, and ginger syrup was an amazing combination with the fried chicken - an awesome balance of sweet and savory. The breading on the chicken though also had a bit of a sweetness too, and was very good. 

The staff were very friendly and attentive, and the atmosphere is very cool - would go back again and again, and would recommend to anyone.

One tip, that I will also share below - make a reservation! This place is hopping, monday through sunday, and twice before coming today I tried to walk in and found them completely full and booked up. Take the time to reserve your table - it's well worth it!
