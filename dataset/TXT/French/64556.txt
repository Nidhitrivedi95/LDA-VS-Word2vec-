Tefx_N6A6nrsdj4jHHnbYg Bonjour! This cafe welcomes you to a little taste of France.  

I am one lucky girl to dine here with a Yelp friend.  Lauren and I had big appetites.  We split the Croque Madame, Quiche Lorraine and Apple Cinnamon Crepe.  It was all a delight.  

The Croque Madame had a rich a flavorful bite.  It is a lovely presentation with the side salad.  The Quiche Lorraine was no slouch.  It was light and fluffy with a delicate crust.  It was also a beautiful plate with the salad served on the side.  The Crepe hit every taste bud.  The sweet and savory crepe was filled with green apples wrapped in a fresh crepe.  Not to mention the fresh cream certainly complimented the sprinkling of cinnamon and sugar.  It is very indulgent.  

When you think we're done, you thought wrong.  They have fresh pastries calling our name.  The Salted caramel cookie is so perfect that I wish I would've taken some home.  There is a delicious balance of the caramel/cookie.  And if you like caramel, don't pass up the salted caramel cupcake.  Moist and decadent.  There was definitely a lot of flavor packed into a mini cupcake.  

It was my first try of a lavender cake.  I guess it was just too much lavender flavor for me.  The cake itself was light and moist.  Like I said, just a bit too much lavender for me.  

The wonderful ladies here are so welcoming and friendly.  I love the first rate customer service they offer.  They make your visit comfortable which is why I'm hoping I'll be back soon.  Thank you for an amazing experience.
