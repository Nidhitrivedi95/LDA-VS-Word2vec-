What a surprise to find the Eiffel Tower Restaurant in Las Vegas to be such a great restaurant.

With a group of 8, we came here for lunch. 

The view from the restaurant is very nice.

Our lunch, of hamburgers and lamb hamburgers was quite good and tasty, and the presentation was quite good also.

The service associated with lunch was very good. I see other YELPER mentioned this also.
