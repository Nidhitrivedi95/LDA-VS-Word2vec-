_cjPEH9wXhKS-HQe_U3M4Q Went there for brunch with my boyfriend. We got the eggs Benedict and the salmon croissant with cream cheese and cucumbers. So fresh and so tasty. Eggs cooked perfectly and the croissants were light and flaky. Salmon was fresh tasting and didn't smell fishy. Cream cheese was smooth and the cucumbers added a wonderful crunch.

We sat out on the patio and it's great because the it's on a side street that isn't too busy so it's quiet enough. But just an FYI, there's a little bit of construction going on next door and a few patrons including ourselves noticed it got pretty dusty at times.

Other than that, food was great and so was the complimentary bread.
