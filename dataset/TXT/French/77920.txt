YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g One of the best dining experiences I have ever had. The server was very helpful and willing to suggest her favorites. This place is definitely not high on value and probably turning an enormous profit on some dishes (ahi tuna tacos come to mind, 3 two-square inch tacos for $12), but some of it is really worth it and not enough to make me knock it down from five stars. 

One thing that would have made me knock it from five stars is the fact that my reservation was not in the computer. Luckily there were literally two other tables in the whole place, but had I spent 10 minutes on the Mandalay Bay reservations line and not gotten a table, I would have been furious and not enjoyed my meal so much, if I would have bothered to stay. A caveat to keep your confirmation number when making a reservation. 

We ordered 9 small plates and a dessert, all for two. I had a restaurant.com coupon and wasn't sure if I would ever be back, so we decided to go all out. The server suggested that we get around 3 per person, but considering how small a few of the small plates were, 9 would have been necessary.

Starting off with the not so great, for myriad reasons:
-Manchego salad - a teeny little dusting of manchego on top of a salad. I was expecting, you know, a lot of manchego considering it is the namesake of the salad. It was good, but somewhat misleading.
-"In the Shower" Mac and Cheese - gourmet mac and cheese with lobster meat in it. I'm sure it's all fantastic quality ingredients, but $18 for a small plate seemed steep.
-Ahi tacos as mentioned

And on to the good:
-Duck Confit - little baby spring rolls with duck meat. Delicious.
-Fried chickpeas - the best value on the menu at $3
-Flatiron steak with chimichurri - deliciously prepared, though we had a lot of extra chimichurri
-Lemon basil risotto - excellent, though slightly overpriced for the amount
-Brie flambee - nice little flatbread with honey and bacon. The combination of the ingredients made it sort of breakfasty, but still delicious.

And finally, one of the best things I ever ate: the steak tartare. It was fantastic. I had only had tartare one other time, and after you get used to the whole, erm, concept, it was truly wonderful. The flavors melded really well together and the dish made our night. For dessert I had a pistachio meringue with chai ice cream. The meringue was extremely sweet but the ice cream was the right sweetness for such a meal.

Happy hour for $5 wells and $6 glasses of wine. But be careful, after the happy hour they jump to $12 and $14 respectively. 

One thing we noticed, though, is that it would be very hard to come here with 3-5 people. With 6 or more you could just do the "eat the menu" option, but with 2 we each got to have a couple bites of each thing. With more than two, you would be picking and choosing who got to have more bites, particularly for things like the ahi tacos and the duck confit. 

Picking up a restaurant.com certificate will definitely help you on price, too. All in all I will be back but with an edited menu and less of a go-all-out attitude so that I can really enjoy just a few things without putting such a large dent in the old pocketbook.

One thing that should be changed both here on Yelp and on the Mandalay Bay website: this place is not dressy. It is in a restaurant row with "patio" seating with people wearing jeans and with shopping bags. It's definitely not a place to come in your bathing suit cover up, but it's not "dressy" as advertised by both these outlets. I stressed out over what to wear for nothing!
