White Chocolate basil-  the basil was nicely balanced with the white chocolate.  It was an unexpected pairing but delicious. 
Sea Salt Carmel was sweet with a hint of salt
Pistachio is my go to macaroon, and i was not disappointed.  

I also ordered a palmier and a croissant.  Both of which I'd go back for. 

The bakery is really beautiful inside and the open kitchen is a nice touch. The staff was helpful and friendly.  I thought the prices were as expected.  You get what you pay for and this place was well worth the price.
