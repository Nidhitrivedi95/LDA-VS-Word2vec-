rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I dunno... it was fun to get dressed up and go to a grown-up restaurant, but I got the feeling they were more interested in the big ticket peeps.
Not much value. 
We ordered the petite plataeu, a cold seafood tower, for $65 if I remember. 1/2 a lobster included. Imagine my chagrin when I noticed Mon Ami Gabi, at the Paris, had a full lobster in their seafood tower for like $20 less.
Ouch.
