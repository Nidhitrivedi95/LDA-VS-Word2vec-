Service is great and pretty quick. Very friendly servers.

The place is nice and pretty. Well-dressed guests.

I've had their halibut which was overcooked. The food was a bit bland for my taste and not the best value. Arugula salad with shaved parmesan was good, but nothing special. The red-wine Sangria is really good and better if you get the pitcher than by the glass.

I usually like going there during summer and sit outside in the patio to enjoy the weather and just relax.

Overall, I'd give it a 3/5, because the food could've been better for the price you pay. I know it's in Yorkville, but there's many other Yorkville restaurants that serve better food for the same price. I know it cause I worked right in the middle of Yorkville before.
