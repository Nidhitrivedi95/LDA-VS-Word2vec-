jLxeBgWhLRbII2ACkgH1Sg The bomb-ass best, real, authentic, French baking in the valley. Also: I've had Peet's coffee before elsewhere - must be the way they brew it here because: THE BEST. 
Real croissants. Not that fake shit they make sammies out of down on the strip with turkey lunchmeat and charge $29. REAL CROISSANTS. 
Go ahead, order a "chocolate croissant", they'll get it for you even though it's got some damn French name like pané chocoläté or something, I dunno do I look like I speak freaking French? 
REAL FRENCH BREAD. Loaves, and they don't cost four bucks! Go here, eat, drink, and thank me. 
You win.
