yVNaMEBUslR_7GbFhurJEg We went for dinner to celebrate our son's 21st birthday. We're from New York. It was a perfect evening. The food was outstanding. The service was superb. Everyone was attentive, charming and extremely knowledgable about the food. Our favorites included the chicken liver mousse which was beautifully plated and had a purée on the side of a local Quebec berry that our server answered our questions about in detail. The octopus was the best we've ever eaten and octopus is our favorite ! Again, our server described how it was steamed for 3 hours and the first time he ate it he also couldn't believe how silky this made the texture. The sommelier was equally helpful and charming. This all occurs in a beautifully restored building.
