rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw Good food, super friendly staff.  The only disappointment for me was that I didn't go with their prix fix menu.  I don't remember the cost, but there was a good selection of options for the three courses, but I'd had my heart set on the escargot.  Escargot is one of those things - if it's on the menu, I will get it, and I will choose the rest of my menu around it, so since that was not one of the appetizer options I went a la carte.  Unfortunately, the escargot was not what I expected. I knew it came wrapped in a pastry puff, and I like anything in a pastry puff, but this just didn't do it for me.  Not bad, just not great.  A bit on the dry and chewy side.  The mussels that I had for dinner made up for it.  A huge bowl of plump mussels in a delicious creamy broth that I just soaked up with the warm baguette that came with it.  I wish I had room for dessert but I was stuffed at that point.  The wait staff was friendly and attentive, checking-in regularly to see if we were ok, or if we needed anything else.
