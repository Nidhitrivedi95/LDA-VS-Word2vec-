4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Finally dined here for breakfast after being to Vegas multiple times, and passing by the restaurant THOUSANDS of times. Actually, I'm mad at myself for not doing it sooner! LOVE THIS PLACE! We dined in what I call "the sun room" (an area between the main dining room, and the outside patio). I loved the ambiance there. I ordered the corned beef hash and a latte, and my sweetie ordered the traditional eggs benedict. The hash was awesome! The corned beef was crispy on the edges, and the poached egg was cooked perfectly. This is a great breakfast joint without being too expensive ($10-$15 per entree), but next time I'll try eating dinner on the outside patio.
