LUd3UdlUvCr54H-7ttm0TQ An awesome restaurant that does local (for what it's worth) food well. We had the French toast and the lobster Benedict. 
Both were excellently done and well portioned. We were very full at the end of the meal. 

We were able to get a seat in front of the kitchen so we got to see the action. It definitely is nice to see the effort they put in. 

Being English speakers in a French province, it is much appreciated that they were very welcoming even though we could only butcher a bit of French. 

Only downside I would say is the slushes are a bit too watery for my liking. 

Aside from that, great food, great service! Also a great location as Jean talon market is right down the street.
