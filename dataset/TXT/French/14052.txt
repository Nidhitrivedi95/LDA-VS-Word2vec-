58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw My favorite brunch in Montreal.  There is an Atlantic plate of different salmon dishes that is up there among the best brunch that I have ever had.  Featuring a salmon cake, smoked salmon eggs, smoked salmon on a Montreal bagel and an amazing salad, I salivate thinking about it.  That said, I clearly love salmon and have never seen so many salmon options on one plate.  That might not be for everyone.

The service is efficient and the space is inviting.  Despite being a large group, we weren't in any way hurried.  Love it.
