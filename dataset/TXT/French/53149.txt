QeFsIMcIFIJcOrpthYL8jg The French Martinis were amazing! The chicken talligettele (spelling) pasta was also great. I was visiting Montreal on the whim and this place was right by our hotel (Marriott Spring hill Suites). The manager (Louie) was so sweet. Definitely a go to restaurant. Did  I mention they had live music? Was awesome, and great for a girls late dinner or date night.
