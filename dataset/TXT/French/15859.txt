6GCbZASjMnAPYBWLc_z30g My friend convinced me to go here for breakfast because it was her father's favorite place.  Having read the Yelp reviews I was unsure but figured why not give it a try.  We were greeted by friendly staff, seated immediately and our waiter was with us within a minute to offer coffee and drinks.  They have a great mimosa menu.  I had the grapefruit and my friend had strawberry lemonade.  AMAZING!  I ordered the croissant benedict  and my friend had the original waffles.  The meal was out of this world amazing!  I'm so glad I ignored Yelp as this is now one of my favorite breakfast establishments.  Next time I'm back in Arizona I will be visiting Mimis Cafe.  Great food and great service!
