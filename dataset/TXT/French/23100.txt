Red Velvet Waffle with chicken!!! The cream cheese drizzle on top of the waffle  was decent. Chicken was two small tenders and not enough meat to be satisfied. I couldn't eat the hash browns, it smell weird and were under cooked. The waffle was tasteless and a bust.  The food  was a big disappointment and definitely not worth paying $18.00! It looked much better than it tasted.


Dont waste your time coming here. It is located in a nice area, but the cafe is very small with limited seating and looks outdated for the area. 

Go somewhere else if your craving chicken and waffles. There was another location in Charlotte that sells it for $5.00-$7.00 with great reviews. If you choose to go here and feel disappointed after. You can only blame yourself, you was warned
