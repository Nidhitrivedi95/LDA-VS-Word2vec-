OYHpqY6-3C-wXR-uPbHhwA 2 Stars because it was a Cute set-up and the places looked great and the people taking our order were so friendly. 

I bought 5 Macaroons. Had one bite of each and I was good. I was told the green was pistachio but tasted like chalky dry coconut. The white with sprinkles tasted like pistachio but very very dry. The purple was the better one but still not my thing. Idk maybe Macaroons just aren't my thing? My Husband ate the strawberry red one and said it was great but refused the rest after one bite of the green. I just don't believe these raves about confections are so awful. They have to be cutting corners in the baking process. It shows. 

My chocolate cake.... The reason for a bad review. It was a hard dry brown brick. They must be storing their pastries incorrectly. Fridge maybe? Very very stale and just plain awful! (Insert grossed out emoji here) The frosting was so hard I stuck my fork in it and I could hold the whole cake up. 

Hide your kids, hide your Wife, hide your tastebuds!  Avoid this place D:
