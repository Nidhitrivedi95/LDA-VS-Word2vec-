B56AYe5GNuavMDtwFsXqzA I had such a good time at Petite Maison that I went there twice in one day! Who would have thought a genuine slice of Paris could be found in Scottsdale?

Each dish I tried was a tasteful pleasure, from the escargot to the onion soup. A highlight for me was their preparation of steak tartare, where just a drop of hot sauce acts as a secret ingredient in bringing out the flavor. Complementing the food is a well-thought out wine list, and at very reasonable prices. If only I had more time, I'd be back for their hamburger.

But perhaps the true mark of an exceptional restaurant is the customer service. I left knowing Wendy, James and Chad on a first name basis, almost as if we were old friends, in fact. I can't wait to return to Arizona, if only to come to Petite Maison one more time.
