Need I go on?

A few friends had recommended MAG prior to my trip to Las Vegas earlier this month, telling me it was a prime spot for people-watching. Situated right on Las Vegas Boulevard (or "The Strip"), MAG was that and so much more.

Located within the Paris Hotel, directly under the Eiffel Tower, MAG welcomes diners with an authentic French experience right down to the decor. The cuisine could, at best, be described as French-American fusion. There's certainly something for everyone on the menu but with a twist that's a bit "en Francais".

Over our three-day trip, my friends and I visited MAG twice: once for lunch and on our last day for breakfast. Both times we were more than impressed - particularly by the impeccable and attentive service. A table on the patio is worth the wait, but make reservations in advance if you're keen but short on time. 

MAG will be a must for me each and every single time I visit Las Vegas.
