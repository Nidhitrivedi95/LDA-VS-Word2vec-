A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g Patisserie Manon is my favorite bakery in the Vegas area!  My family moved to the Summerlin area 5 years ago and ever since discovering this spot, we have consistently gone in.  I think we may have sampled almost every cake, macaroon, and fruit tart.  It's difficult to make a decision about what to pick up when you go in because everything looks amazing in the display case.  One of my favorites is the fraiser cake which is a light white cake with strawberries and cream.  On occasion, you'll find day old bread for a steal!  For every celebration and birthday, we have come here to pick up a cake or a few desserts!
