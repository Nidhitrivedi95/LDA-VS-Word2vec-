1idRJwqXxxmgSyQRKag4KQ I've been struggling with this one.  It has been a couple of months since my wife and I had dinner here.  It was a huge disappointment, so much so, that I didn't want to write a review at all.  I thought with time, my memories would fade but they didn't.  Let me start with the positive:  Good atmosphere, awesome service and great wine pairings.  The appetizers were pretty good, we had Plateau of Charcuterie.  

Unfortunately the app was the best part of the meal, hence the one star review.  I had the braised beef and my wife had Duck Magrite.  My beef was way over cooked, dry and stringy drenched in rich gravy.  The bone marrow croquets were awful.  Cold and solid in the middle with a slightly off taste.  Duck was tough and tasteless, and again covered in rich gravy.  We also had Foie Gras and it was disappointing, it tasted like pate with pork undertones.  

My review is definitely against the grain.  Maybe we didn't order the right dishes, maybe the chef had an off night.
