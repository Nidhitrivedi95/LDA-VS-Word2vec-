rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I didn't actually have dinner here, rather some amazing potato leak soup, bread and a few Chimays and some great Pinot. Some co-workers had the steak frites and really enjoyed it. The waiter seriously sucked though... not sure how he got the job but he literally knew nothing about the wine and was a little rude. Aside from him it was a nice place to hang out with some great people and have some good wine, food and lots o laughs.
