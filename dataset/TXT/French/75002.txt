XZ7eQLjyGXf6y69UT4SGhg Love this place!!!  It's sorta on my way to work and sorta close to home so I sorta find myself sorta going out of my way to get there amazing espresso drinks.

I love me a good iced latte and this place does them right! They don't taste burnt and are always on point.  I've tried the food and loved my crepe!!  They are prepared fresh while you wait.  Each pastry I've tried has been excellent!  

The service is great! Since I've been coming here it's been the same staff which is great!  No turnover at a restaurant rarely happens.  I walk in and now the servers ask "the usual"?  How awesome is that?  My order isn't simple as I like half caffeine and half vanilla with 2% milk.  They always get it right!!  

Finally someplace sorta close to where I frequent!!  I say, give this place a shot!  You will definitely find yourself going outta your way just to come here.

They are off Ft. apache and Twain on the NW side of the street (right hand side as you drive on Ft apache going towards Flamingo.  It's before Twain :-)
