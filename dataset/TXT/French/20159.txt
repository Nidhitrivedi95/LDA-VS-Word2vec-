aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw Today, I had the honor of trying the macarons--chocolate and vanilla!! 

First bite of vanilla: chewy and SWEET! 
Second bite of vanilla: mmmm! the outside is crispy and the amount of almond in it is just right.
Third bite of vanilla: i guess the buttercream is a little too much for me.

Onto the chocolate ...  LOVE IT! Definitely not over-the-top sweet like the vanilla flavor.
