gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA We ate here nearly two years ago, and we still talk about this meal at least once a month to date.  If there is a more upscale, classy, and romantic restaraunt in the US, I'd like to see it.  We used to think Le Circ in the Bellagio was the best, but this is even on another level.  It helps that the view at night on the 54th floor is mind-blowing.  The cocktails are A+, and food is so good it's a waste of time to even describe it.  You have to go for yourself.  If you want the perfect setting for a romantic night, start here.
