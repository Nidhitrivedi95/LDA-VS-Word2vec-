aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw The line here was shorter than the one I usually see back in Yountville, CA. 

- Croissant: not bad 
- Epi baguette: sadly stale 
- Chocolate almond croissant: consistent with the Yountville one in terms of having a nice generous base layer of frangipane and chocolate, and the almond crust on top was nice
- Kouign amann: too buttery and sweet compared to some other ones I've had 
- Pistachio macaron: standard

When we asked for butter and got Grassland whipped butter packs, it was disappointing. I wasn't expecting Animal Farm, but still.  The line was also pretty disorganized, and they ended up charging us for a box of macarons (and giving us the box of macarons) in our large order when we never actually asked for it.  When we brought it to their attention, they took it off, but it took multiple attempts to place orders for them to get our stuff right.
