jaSowNITPRRCYpPb3_pjdA Four of us met to enjoy brunch at Andre's this past Saturday morning.  Chef De Leon Lopez was given carte blanche to cook for the table.  The dishes served were:

Baguette with farm butter.
Beignets.
House made pastries.
Escargots de Bourgogne. 
Charcuterie platter.
Brown sugar glazed bacon.
Classic eggs Benedict.
Andre's salmon Benedict.
Croque madame.
Quiche Lorraine.
Vegetable quiche.
Chicen and waffles.
Foie gras.
Lobster roll with fries.
Lobster roll with salad.
Flatiron steak frites.
Lemon tart.
Sunday sundae.
Root beer float.
Walnut cake.
Crème brûlée.

There wasn't one thing on this list I wouldn't recommend.  This was my first time to Andre's new spot and I was blown away.  Even the chicken and waffles were very, very good!  I will point out a few things I would order again.  Without a doubt, I'd get the foie gras, the lobster roll with fries, escargots, beignets, and the lemon tart.  For me, those were the standouts.

Service was excellent.  Water glasses were constantly refilled and our coffee cups never wanted for refilling.

Now that I've had the brunch offerings, it will soon be time to go back for dinner service,  It's great having a French restaurant that's a quick 10 minute drive from home.
