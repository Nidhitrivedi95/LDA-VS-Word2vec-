1ThbwFVBL9YA2oOM11iO7g For a lunch place, this is definitely four stars.

We all had the pressed cubano sandwich with fries, which came with a creme-brulee for dessert (it included a coke as well, but we opted for beer as it was a going away lunch and we were sad about the person going away).

In any event, all that for $15 was great.

The sandwich was great,  (grainy mustard, barely-noticeable-except-for-their-awesome-tanginess sliced pickles, and the melty cheese (yumm)[yeah these are square brackets in a Yelp review])).

I say melty cheese because there was nothing really different or compelling about the cheese by itself. The sandwich was a unit-- a unit deliciousness. Deconstructing any of the ingredients separately would do it a disservice. 

So I say to you, order the sandwich and you're 90% likely to enjoy it (and opt for the salad for dinner).
