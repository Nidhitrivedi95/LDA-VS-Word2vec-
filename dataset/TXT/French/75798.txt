First the bread with hummus they bring you. I've never had such flavourless hummus in my life! I ordered the confit of muscovy duck. Its basically a duck poutine. Should have been crazy tasty in my estimation. It had almost no flavour. very disappointing. My friend ordered the flat-iron steak with frites. Again, no flavour. Its surprising to me that a restaurant like this with a limited specialty menu and expensive prices would serve such lackluster dishes.

The drinks on the hand were nice. We has some lemoncello martini's that were pretty decent. The other nice thing about the place is the cozy atmosphere. 

If I ever went back it would only be for drinks. Might qualify as a decent date option for apps and drinks if it wasn't in such a sketchy neighbourhood.
