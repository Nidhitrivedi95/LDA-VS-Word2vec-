s1NqIkLMCFX6PuTk6wt6QA A hidden gem! I had often spied l'Anecdote while biking along the Rachel bike path but never thought much more about. Then someone who lives nearby mentioned going there for breakfast most weekends, and an acquaintance mentioned having a great burger there. So when my partner and I found ourselves less than a block away, famished, it was time we tried it out. Are we ever glad we did!.

When you first enter the restaurant it appears tiny. It isn't huge, but there is a back area that provides more seating. Everything is retro cool, right down to the jukebox. The staff are pleasant. Its a comfy place.

The food!  We each ordered a burger, and neither of us ordered the standard beef!  I had the pesto chicken burger, and I was pleasantly surprised it wasn't a standard chicken breast, or even worse a generic chicken patty, but instead a yummy patty made of ground chicken, perfectly seasoned!  The burgers do not automatically come with sides, so we shared a poutine.  The standard size was perfect for sharing.  The gravy was delicious, so much so that I look forward to going back and trying a hot chicken sandwich or hamburger steak.
