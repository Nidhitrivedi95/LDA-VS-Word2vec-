hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA Pleasantly surprised by this little shop! Came by for breakfast sandwiches. They were delicious, but a little small. Felt like a good amount at the time, but we were hungry again pretty soon.

Also felt like I had to knock off a star because we ordered a green juice('be change'), which sounded like a great combination... but we couldn't finish it. We're usually huge fans of green drinks, so maybe there's a sweetener something, it just felt off. Maybe it was just our drink though.
