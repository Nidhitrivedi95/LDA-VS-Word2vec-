8xCiibfgqy-8xpCWEaguqg I absolutely love The Keg (oddly enough, the Ville-Marie one more so than the old-port) - But they're both 5 stars, nonetheless. 

Their filet mignon is to die for. You ask for medium rare and you ALWAYS get what you ask for, nothing less. There's also the baseball top, which is quite intimidating when it arrives at your table, however it was so good, I couldn't stop eating it... Even after I was full. 

Get the Keg size Bloody Caesar... It never fails. They put some sort of long spicy bean in it, which adds its own personal uniqueness to a classic. 

Staff is extremely friendly and professional. A plus.
