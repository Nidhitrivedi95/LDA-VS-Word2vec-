5fquJHY2hMX9tPRD5s0t5g I LOVE Roosters!!!  Haha - it is so perfect for me.  Located in 1BAC (also attached to Founders Hall) it is very easy to get to.  The bar is downstairs where they have bar bites (I heard they are great but have not tried them.)  Upstairs is the main restaurant with a huge open kitchen - love that!!  It makes a very exciting atmosphere.  The booths are cozy and welcoming.    

Great variety on the menu and huge wine list.  The fried oysters are the best I have ever had - light breading and smooth flavor.  I have had sandwiches here as well as the BBQ quarter chicken.  The BBQ sauce is homemade and very unique.  It is a thin sauce but exceptionally flavorful.  The portions are small but I think they are perfect for me - I hate taking leftovers home (especially if I am headed to a play at the Booth next.)  Great spot!
