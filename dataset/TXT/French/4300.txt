Never been to a place like this in France, so can't really compare.
But for me, this was as French as it gets.

We tried:
Bone Marrow - very interesting.
Beef Tartare - great.
Smoked Salmon - yummy.
Some salad with cheese - I didn't try it but my friend liked it.
Apple Crumb Tarte with Vanilla ice cream - amazing.

Complimentary baguette with butter & mustard, and house pickles are GREAT.

With all the food + coffee, 2 red wine glasses + 2 beers = under $100.

Definitely the place to go when looking for a good French Quebec restaurant.

BEST SERVICE in Montreal!!!
