pmoIMK8zGWvKsVOPDBYfzg We dined here on a travelzoo deal that was a great deal. We got three courses for $100 bucks total. I thought it was a great deal and what is nice about Andre's is that it's kind of hidden. The actual restaurant is a very small room with no windows. Unlike most of the restaurants here that are massive, Adnre's can sit maybe 30 people max at one time which is nice because the place is very quiet and intimate. The décor is gorgeous. The servers are top notch and everything is served with a metal cover on the plates. It is very French, very nice, and very formal. Please don't wear jeans and a t shirt here and ruin a fine dining experience for the rest of us. Lobster bisque was great, Seabass was perfect, and the truffle pasta was amazing. Everything we ate was bursting with flavor. My husband had the roast chicken and said it was the best he had ever tasted. Excellent experience!
