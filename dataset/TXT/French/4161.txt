We ordered the fish soup which was bland, the bone marrow which had a disgusting texture, the calf liver and the toulouse.  The calf liver was not cooked properly, the toulouse tasted like something you would get from a package in the grocery store, and the mashed potatoes were dry like they were from a package.

This place was not worth it at all. It was an awful, overpriced experience and I would not recommend anyone go there. I had a reservation to Maison Publique that night and I wish I had gone there instead. Or Burger King. Both would have been better.
