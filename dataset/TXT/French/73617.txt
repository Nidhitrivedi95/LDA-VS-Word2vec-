We did the tasting menu with the wine pairing. If you are going to go here I would recommend to go big or go home. I never really thought wine pairings were worth the extra price but I was proven how wrong I was in this case. The flavor combinations were divine. The type of food you eat slow and quietly to savor every taste. 

We were worried that the tasting menu would not fill us up by the time we were done but I was well stuffed by dessert. The service was just what it should be, attentive polite upscale but not annoying. Go ahead and read the tasting menu on their website - the first dish was my favorite. Lobster salad paired with champagne - what an amazing combination this was..

Make sure you are dressed propoerly. They made my Dad change his pants because he was wearing shorts. I can understand why they would do that though.

I ate at many expensive places in Vegas. Food is always amazing but this place is simply an experience you don't forget - very special.
