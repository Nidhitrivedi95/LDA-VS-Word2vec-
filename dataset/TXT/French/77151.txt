YUFxSG6idHePsxOmnSHtpQ First of all, I am hangry writing this review. 

1) This is obviously a family friendly establishment so loud conversations are carried by yelling across the table because the young customers are crying. 

2) Be prepared to be yelling at your waiter/waitress when ordering...again your voice has to cancel out the kids crying again. 

3) Avoid Saturday mornings. Maybe Sunday mornings too.
