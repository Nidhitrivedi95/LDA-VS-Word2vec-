L'Express is a proper bistro complete with bare essential service. We also waited 40 minutes beyond our reservation time. Trust me the free beer was not worth waiting 40 minutes. 

The food was only worthy of two stars. Salad was just a salad. Terrine of foie gras was nice but not worth 30 CAD. (Why on every menu in Canada is foie gras so expensive? I find it much for expensive than anywhere I've been the USA.). Veal cheek casserole was nice but nothing special. The risotto could have used more protein in it. Lamb was OK. Just nothing popped out as being above average. However, the bread was awesome. 

No need for me to come back here.
