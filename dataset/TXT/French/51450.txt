P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ Ridiculously OVERPRICED!  We've dined at Daniels NYC, Gary Danko, French Laundry and more.  Guy Savoy provides fine food, fine atmosphere and great/friendly service but their prices are so exorbitant it is hard to enjoy the experience.  It would practically be cheaper to fly from California to NYC and enjoy a perfect meal at Daniel. And considering we were there at 9pm on a busy Las Vegas Thursday night and the place was practically empty, it seems that others are catching on.  We won't be back.
