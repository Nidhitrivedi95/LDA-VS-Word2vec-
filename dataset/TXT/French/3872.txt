2B46bRpDh49eDyjXGhL_ZQ First time diner- wow is this place authentic.  Had a nice brunch there today, a savory and a sweet crepe, with cider.   
Ingredients: impeccable.  Presentation: professional.  I don't speak French, but the customers were conversing quite easily at tables, and the warm welcomes from friends was evident.  

Savory: Wheat crepe, with ham, spinach and bleu cheese.  Sweet: Egg, nutella, banana, whip cream.  

Visit when you want some home cooking, some friendliness, and taste the hard work put into her business.
