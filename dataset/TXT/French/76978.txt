ytD9rJ-jcb8zMUCfiYCnFw Got croque monsieur without cheese (lactose intolerant). It was not that great, I suggest ordering another dish. The waiting staff was quite friendly and attentive even during the Sunday rush. I like the atmosphere, but the food was not anything spectacular.

I don't recommend the croque monsieur (maybe the cheese makes a huge difference?). Ham was not too fatty though.

Will try a diff dish when I get a chance.
