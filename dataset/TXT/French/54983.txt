rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I've been here about 4 times....while I was expecting the world, it really is a pretty solid establishment..but not great.  Its solid....but really not that much of a knockout as one would expect with Kellar's repuatation.  

This is a combo review of several visits....

the Moules Marinade was quite good...and filling...however, it was crap compared to any bistro you would find in Paris or Belgium.  I wish they were a bit more agressive with the flaovring of the broth itself....

Chicken and Waffles....while the waffles were great (esp. the butter), I really like Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles much better...it just seemed a bit too refined and was quite average.  

Salmon Rilletes:  this was damn awesome.  This alone brought the review from 3 to 4 stars. 

Croque Madam- Too rich for my tastes

Berries: great

service: has always been great.
