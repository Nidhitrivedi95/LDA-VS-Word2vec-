ovtlrcsVRlgZZQUlHs_ovw We love this place! They have the best burgers in the state, hands down! Great selection of craft beer, nice mixed drinks and the rest of the menu is solid too. We also love the atmosphere, very dark and romantic. Not like any other restaurant you will find in Surprise, I guarantee that!
