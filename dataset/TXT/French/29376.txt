On the PLUS Side, there Sunday Brunch is IMPRESSIVE if your willing to fork the over 30$ bill for it.
It has everything with a couple chefs and several stations (omelet, crepre, pasta,..) where they cook on the stop with your instructions. 
Basically imagine a brunch on a luxury cruise with a lot of breakfast and lunch items like sliced roast beef, seafood, all kinds of pasta, omelets, fruits, ... 
Dessert include a large chocolate fountain, creme brule, cannolis, .. Just in desserts you get a lot of your value lol
It is good for a celebration with family or friends as a group but I would't go there by myself lol
