Does that sound like an overstatement?  Probably.  I mean, it won't make you rich (unless you can find a way to market it to the masses, and then it might). It probably won't help you find the love of your life - but if you do and s/he doesn't like this quiche then it probably wasn't meant to be.  Maybe it will make you smarter - I mean, ordering the quiche is a smart thing to do, so if you order it you must be pretty smart, right?

If I lived on the west side of town, I would probably have a slice of quiche weekly.  At least.  It comes in a variety of delectable flavors, but the star of this little slice of heaven is the pairing of thin crust and light custardy eggs.  This is no thick triangular slice of over-cooked egg product.  No.  This is the real deal.

While you're ordering, don't forget to choose a sweet from the case and a loaf of bread to take home (the olive loaf is particularly good).  But get there early, choices get slim the later in the day it gets.  And for heaven's sake - don't forget the quiche!
