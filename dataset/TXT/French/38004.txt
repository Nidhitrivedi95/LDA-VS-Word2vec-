JePdoHGJ2kWRQkfGx0T34Q To all the yelpers dealing with Celiac disease; Eating 'Truly Gluten Free' when traveling can be very difficult but the folks at this great little Churrasqueira put me at ease right away. The owner happily answered all my questions so that I could make some safe GF selections and enjoy some tasty Portuguese food stress free. In fact, he is planning to make some minor adjustments to more of his dishes to cater to the gluten intolerant. The BBQ Chicken is off the charts. Fresh, tender, literally falling off the bone and soooo delicious. This is a second generation family business. The owner takes pride in the place and makes sure every surface is sparkling clean. 
With just a few tables, it's clear that the business is set up for mostly take out which was perfect for me at the time. Reasonable prices for generous size servings. 
Don't miss this place if you are traveling to Toronto.
