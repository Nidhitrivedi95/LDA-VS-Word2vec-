MdjIl105vqCYUGKFSUVytA Very friendly and prompt service by the wait staff.  The buffet was fresh with many items you could tell were homemade.  The shrimp were big and tasty and the homemade seafood sauce was a great match.  While the roast lamb wasn't anything spectacular, this high end place did a great crispy fried chicken to pair with waffles.  The salmon wellington was also tasty.
