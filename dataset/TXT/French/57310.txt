rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A When you want to wine and dine our every now and then you expect it to be absolutely amazing. The waitress and entrance to the restaurant was fantastic. I don't eat seafood but the the rest of the people I went with did and the plates looked amazing. The reason for the 3 stars I ordered eggs Benedict with pork .. Pretty darn average and lemon tart for desert, did not like that at all. For desert stick with the sorbet and stay away from lemon tart.
