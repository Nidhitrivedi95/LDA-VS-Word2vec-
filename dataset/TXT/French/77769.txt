YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g I went here on a Sunday night with two of my friends as part of my Vegas bachelorette weekend. We made reservations but they weren't really necessary. The atmosphere was upscale without the stuffiness. We all loved the decor.They had a very interesting cocktail list. My friend got an Absinthe Apple Martini and they made me a special drink that wasn't listed (St. Germain, Pear Vodka, sparkling wine). Both drinks were out of this world. Our waitress was super nice and even brought me a special desert that said congratulations for the engagement! The dinners we got and deserts were great. My only complaint is that the menu was kind of small and there wasn't any listed option to add any meat to out salads. Other than that, we all loved it!
