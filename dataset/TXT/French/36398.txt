I do NOT recommend Amuse for a leisurely dinner.  We arrived early (around 6:15pm) so we could have a drink first. We were pestered to hurry up and order right away, even though the restaurant was almost empty.  I've worked in the restaurant business and I understand they need turnover, but why the pressure throughout our whole meal? Since we had a clear view of the door we were ready to ask for the check when our table was needed, even willing to go elsewhere for dessert and coffee, but I don't think anyone showed up after the first seating. When we got our bill there were lots of empty tables and noone waiting. Later in the meal, my friend told our server (also the owner) that we would leave if she needed the table. The server bluntly & rudely told her that that she had made other arrangements when we didn't leave on time(what arrangements? nobody else came in) and that our cue to leave was getting our bill.  
Had we not been so rushed I would have loved to have had a cocktail to start, a second bottle of wine with dinner and coffee after.  Their loss I guess. Too bad, because I have always enjoyed the food and ambiance at Amuse and love to promote local businesses. I just can't understand treating customers like this. 'We were NOT Amused'.
