U1ZpRirMDXF_4_MCFAcmvg Came across the place on a stroll down Rue Rachel. Stopped to read the menu, which sounded good, and apportez votre vin to boot! What cinched it was the fact that a lady commented, "best restaurant in the city!" as she walked by. Trusting that she wasn't just a well-placed employee/friend of the restaurant, we made a reservation for that night.

We were seated promptly (sigh, with an English menu) in this cozy little restaurant, wine poured, starting in on our prix-fixe (starting @ $37). We started with the escargot & mussels, then a simple gazpacho & salad, then lamb &  veal sweetbreads, then coffee & dessert of some berry sponge cake & chocolate mousse crepe.

All very simple, very good, very French.
