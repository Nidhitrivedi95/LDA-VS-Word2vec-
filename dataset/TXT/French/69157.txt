w2tr0PA0b3tg8pId0kjM-A I couldn't resist stopping by Gaby Et Jules today while shopping around Squirrel Hill. I was never a macaron lover until I visited the famous Bouchon Bakery in NYC and tasted what a fine work of art the macaron can be.

The sales associate was very friendly, and my husband and I tried a couple tasty samples. We settled on purchasing a half dozen macarons (for $13) and selected lavender, pistachio, white chocolate basil, Le Pittsburgh (which I believe was Bailey's?), and two of the Sea Salt. My two favorite macarons were the Sea Salt - so happy we got two - and the pistachio. Unfortunately, both the lavender and the white chocolate basil macarons were pretty soft and mushy. 

I really wanted to give Gaby Et Jules rave reviews, but after spending over $2 per macaron, I thought that having a couple poorly prepared macarons in the mix just wasn't acceptable.
