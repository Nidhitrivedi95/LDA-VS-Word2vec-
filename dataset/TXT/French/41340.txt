kGOr_D-LNpgZ2M9N8TT4QQ I decided to do my birthday brunch at this place. I chose la societe because of my past experience and the consistency of the food and service.

I was told for a group larger than 8 you need a set menu, so I chose the 35$ per person (I know, steep). I have to say I left very disappointed with the food and the service. The food was subpar, not presented as described in the set menu (potatoes missing with quiche, no scones, etc), potatoes were served cold to the extent we ordered French fries, quiche was soggy, the pastries were not fresh. The only good thing served was the salad, and the portions were not enough for 13 people.

The service was very poor. More often than not we were left for extended periods of time with no coffee and water and had to chase the Waitresses. On top of that, we went for a fixed menu and the server came asking if people wanted dessert and that was not planned and felt like a money grab. She didn't even know that I had left my CC information and my guests were fighting over who pays at the end.

The bill was $725, For the price I paid, this was a terrible terrible experience!!! Very disappointed. To add insult to injury, I complained and all I got we will look into it, and promise to make it better next time. Ya right, as if I am going to give any more business to them with rectifying what happened.
