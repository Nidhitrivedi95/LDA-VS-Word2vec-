YVYHX7RCPjCBqEth2CS91Q If you read through here you'll see a lot of familiar themes for the people who have given this place a poor review, namely poor service and mediocre food.  While the location and style of the restaurant are nice, unfortunately that can only go so far to save a dining experience.

Once seated we waited an interminable amount of time to speak with a server. It was so long in fact that we had to literally shout a passing waiter down.  We ordered wine and attempted to order an appetizer, only to find out that they were out of our first three choices at 7:30. When we weren't prepared to order our main course we were scolded and told that we would have to wait longer for our meals now.  And wait we did.

While we sipped our bottle of wine, which was the wrong bottle and opened before it was presented to us, we waited for our tartar. After a near 30 minute wait for raw beef, it took another 40 minutes for us to receive our entrees (even though we had ordered them only moments after the tartar.)  While we waited, we watched tables around us ask about their meals, only to be told that there was only one chef tonite and that "people need a night off!"  The chicken and lamb were cooked well but very bland, and the sauce was ineffective in enhancing the dishes.

After over two hours and a hefty bill the over whelming urge to leave was just too strong to recommend this place to anyone else.  Obviously some people love it, but enough people have had the same type of experience to raise genuine red flags.
