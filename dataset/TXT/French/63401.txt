SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA Our family was in Cleveland for my husbands heart surgery.  We wanted to be together and enjoy fine dining in Cleveland just like we do in New Oeleans.  
Our party of 7 was very happy with our great table a corner with sofa seating.   
My grandson said the specify made fettuccini was Really Good!! He is a fettuccini expert. 
I selected the soup, salad and appetizer specials. Love when I don't have to ponder a menu. So happy to be able to enjoy the family meal. 
The most impressive thing of the restaurant was that we forgot a spiderman case filled with favorite toys. I received a call in the morning to say they had it and we could pick it up any time. Funny thing is that we all thought we had left it in the lobby of the Intercontinental. 
Good thing we had a limo service...did I say the wine list was awesome!
