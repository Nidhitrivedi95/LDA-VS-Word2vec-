rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A The hostess in front was not at all friendly. She didn't even welcome us. Just asked for name and party. That was kind of a bad start... The wait was 50 minutes for Sunday at 12... We waited the 50 minutes Bc I had wanted to try this place for a while....we were seated in 53 mins. 

The waitress Megan took 10 mins to greet us at our table ad she wasn't all that helpful. When I asked if the waffles were good and she replied, "yeah."  Let me tell you after she too our order she did NOTHING for us. We actually ordered another side dish through another waiter.  

The busboy was great! Always filling up our water cups. We personally gave him cash tip and left our waitress with a 5% tip Bc again she did NOTHING. She didn't even serve our food get us condiments. NOTHING. 

My husband got the ham steak which took 20 mins to rcv. I ordered the waffles and it took 30 mins. Again I ordered waffles- not chicken and waffles just waffles... 30 mins. 

The male waiters were all very nice and attentive to us and our needs.. All of the women workers seemed to have a pretty large stick up their............ 

I will not return here again.. So disappointed in the upgraded ihop/Denny's food.  Not worth the wait, money or rude service. Blah!  

The service was so bad that my husband who never complains about anything, was even pissed and called the manager... He spoke with "yushon?" And she offered to pay for our next meal which we all know is the restaurants way of saying "shut your complaining"
