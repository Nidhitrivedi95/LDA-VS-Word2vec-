2B46bRpDh49eDyjXGhL_ZQ My wife and I went for a late lunch on a Thursday afternoon solely based on the great rating. We were not disappointed!

I had no idea they had gluten-free options, so that was a pleasant surprise.  I had the Marion (tomato, mozzarella, pesto) and added turkey for additional protein. It went quickly. 

We had our 2-year-old with us, and we shared with her (and "bought her" the Tom - Nutella, Banana, and whipped cream to share).

Great atmosphere, lovely owner, and worth repeating. Thanks, Maggie!
