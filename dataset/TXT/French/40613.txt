KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA My wife and I love this place.  We go there every Valenties day for the Dinner.  We eat there occassionally throughout the year for lunch.  They have outside seating that has a beautiful view of the Lake.  Our favorite thing about the restaurant is that you can pick from a huge selection of wines.  We like to try new wines, and they are always helpful suggesting something based on the wines we know that we like.  The food has always been great, and we have never had bad service.  They are a little bit on the pricey side, but with good food and a great view it is definitely worth it.
