AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw I don't usually like to write a review after only one trip to a restaurant, however, this place is AMAZING and I just had to write a review.  My husband and I went here for breakfast and both had the continental breakfast.  The bagel with chive cream cheese with smoked samon and capers was all tasty, but not a stand out item.  The stars were the croissants.  We tried plain, chocolate, and apricot.  They were all buttery and flaky and perfect.  The favorite though was the apricot.  Any time I can see whole slices of fruit on a pastry, it's a good sign.  Words fail me at this time in how to possibly describe the wonderfullness that is the apricot croissant.

Now, the reason for only 4 stars.  Usually somewhat slow service doesn't bother me and is easily overlooked with good food.  Hovever, the service here was pathetic.  When we arrived we were the only ones in the entire place.  After taking our drink orders, we didn't see our server again for 10-15 minutes.  This after she had just told us to let her know if we wanted our bagels toasted.  I guess we were supposed to walk around searching for her after we got our bagels from the bar?  A huge group of people walked in about halfway through our meal (all going to a Paul Mitchell convention and all wearing entirely black and sporting outlandish hair styles...annoying and loud...).  I thought, surely the servers will have to come over more often with so many people here now, but no.  Still waited forever for our check.

Next trip, we will be back.  Maybe I'll get to try the yummy looking desserts at the pastry counter.
