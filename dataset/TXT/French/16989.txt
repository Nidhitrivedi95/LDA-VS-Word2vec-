9ET_RUNztevq4_OLAX80Gg You really can't go wrong with anything here.  I travel to Toronto frequently and end up eating here since its located right in my hotel. I've ventured to outside restaurants in Yorkville but the consistency of Boulud makes me opt to stay in most times.

Breakfast:
Smoked Salmon and Scrambled eggs for something hearty, great with the chives
Yogurt Parfait for something light

Lunch:
Lobster salad - amazing
Gazpacho

Dinner: 
Anything Cod - it's always done well.
Duo of Cumbrae Beef - delicious and not too big, oddly really liked asparagus custard 

Passable: Galantine de Volaille.. I still don't really know what this is, other than it wasn't for me.
