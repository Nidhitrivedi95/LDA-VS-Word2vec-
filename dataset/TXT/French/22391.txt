BSmqxPbQglQwP2R56OqOag I am trying to be a better Yelper and my review of Local Bistro is long over due.  This is one of my favorite dining spots in the entire Valley.  In fact, my fiance and I literally fell in love with one another at this place about a year ago.  

Typically, we sit at the bar because we like the casual and efficient service.  The bartender will have our bottle of Malbec ready to serve when she sees us coming through the door.

My favorite dishes:

 #1 Drunk bread:  Ummm to DIE for delish!  A huge slab of ciabatta bread is soaked in white wine and baked with Gruyère cheese in a hot iron skillet.  It comes out bubbling and creamy.  If I didn't give 2 cents about the circumference of my thighs I would eat it ALL the time!

#2 Tuna Nicoise Salad.  It's healthy, fabulous, and filling.  Great as an entree or splitting as an appetizer.

#3 Chicken Parm: A huge portion of pounded chicken that is lightly battered.  It is big enough to share if your appetite is light or watching your portion size.  When sharing, we order extra arugula and marinara sauce.  Perfecto!

#4 Spanish Risotto:  WOW!  It's a phenomenon! A treasure of seafood surprises await your tastebuds with this risotto.

*TIP from a regular* - if you LOVE spicy then be sure to ask for the hot sauce called Mi Salsa.  I am a hot sauce ho and very critical.  This is one of the BEST I have ever had in my life.  

The owner ALWAYS comes by to welcome us.  There are plenty of "good" restaurants but the level of personalized service really keeps me coming back again and again. Local Bistro put a happy face on my heart and tummy.
