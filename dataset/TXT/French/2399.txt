0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g I want to give it 3.5 but that's not an option. I have wanted to eat here ever since I found out it was awarded 2 michelin stars. But reading the menu I had always been reluctant because there is a serious lack of creativity and it seems dated.  
 Turns out my preconceived perceptions were accurate. Eating here is like a culinary time warp back to 1985. With an ambiance that is very quiet and stuffy (not good when your in Vegas).
 We did the degustation menu (which based on reading previous reviews hasn't changed in a very long time). To recap Lobster Salad, Scallop, Foie Gras & either Turbot or Lamb (I chose the turbot) followed by choice of dessert. 
 What the restaurant deserves credit for is service and execution. Although the dishes were rather boring conceptually in each case the protein was cooked perfectly. Maybe the best seared scallop I have ever been served. Thus the 3.5 rating. 
 If you are dining with the elderly or are not an adventurous diner you'll probably be very happy. But, if your like me and prefer something lively, innovative and unique Picasso is not for you.
