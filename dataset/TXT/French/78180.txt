YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g I enjoyed the food, but it was nothing spectacular to be honest.  Everything was good, not great.  The service was just so-so.  It took a long time for someone to come to our table, and when we were not ready to order, it took even longer for the waiter to come back the second time.  I guess I expect much more when you're paying that much for dinner.  
We opted to try 5 different appetizers/tapas and as i said above, they were good, but not great.  
I was really hoping to have a particular dessert that someone told me I had to try, but it was taken off the menu the day before - figures.
With all of the great restaurants that Vegas has to offer, I would likley skip this place next time.  Unless the service gets much better and the plates become more memorable, it's just an overprice restaurant.
