LHwzyN5cllTfLuZ8v2k_Bg 2 good friends,a bottle of good Corbieres and bistro food.Parfait? 
The 'special' was a pork chop with melted cheese . Yum good German food?Greasy consistently terrible frites. Seafood stew a klutzy bouillabaisse ( this ain't L'Express)God awful looking pates.Fresh from the tank trout.Kidneys ,not overcooked

 this time ,with port sauce the latter thankfully replaced  on request by a red wine mustard sauce(not a la moutarde)Out of season asparagus fresh as the air on a 767 flight from Lima.
 icecreams served with canned ersatz foam.Warily friendly staff. 
Ou est la France?Not in Toronto.
C'est triste.
