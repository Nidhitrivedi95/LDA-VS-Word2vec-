eUjDWzbQ6eLZy0uELEOa9Q Great ambiance and large food selection made this $24.95 brunch buffet worth it.

We had made a reservation for 4 and seated in a great booth. Our server immediately brought us coffee and water. If you're looking to splurge, the minimum price for a bottle of wine was over $100, so we passed.

Lots of variety to pick in the buffet line. First the salads: garden, chickpea, beets, potato, macaroni with pesto sauce. For the mains, there was plenty of potatoes, scrambled eggs, bacon (regular and peameal), waffles, french toast, sausages, etc. Even lunch foods were available - pasta, chicken, etc.

Pastries lined the entire bar so there was no shortage of danishes, biscuits, cinnamon rolls, or croissants.

Usually, I don't expect a lot of dessert selection but I was impressed with the choices here - mini creme brulees, chocolate mousse tarts, apple crisp, mango tarts, macaroons, brownies, and other cookies/squares galore!

Service was fantastic. Our waiter made sure we always had plenty of coffee/tea and water. 

Would definitely return for special occasions.
