4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Apparently the last time I ate here I gave up meat for Lent, well well well what do you know? I am now a vegetarian :)

There wasn't much vegetarian options but it could be my fault, since I didn't ask. I did see on their menu that they had Gluten-Free options. Pretty cool.

I settled on ordering the Butternut Squash & Brie Quiche. The cole slaw on the side was bit salty but I finished it. My quiche was a bit plain but I loved it & thought it was delicious. Nothing "food-coma" induced but juuuuuuust right :)

Service was good, as usual :)
We always make a stop here whenever we are in LV, it's a must!
