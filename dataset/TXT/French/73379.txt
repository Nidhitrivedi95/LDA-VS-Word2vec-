xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g My absolute favorite place in Vegas!  The most romantic, enchanting, wonderful restaurant I have ever dined.  The atmosphere is so romantic, the servers treat you like you're their only guest.  You feel so special.  The food is amazing (with the exception of when my husband tricked me into thinking the escargot were sauteed mushrooms - they're snails!  So mean!)  The interior of the restaurant is nothing but elegant and classy.  Be sure to dress up or you miss half the experience.  Make it an evening to remember.  And then to top it off - those beautiful Bellagio fountains ... Wow!  Thank you Eiffel Tower Restaurant for making each trip I take with my hubby to Vegas the most amazing experience.  My friends all thank me when they get home for recommending.  Do not hesitate to spend the money - soooo worth every penny!
