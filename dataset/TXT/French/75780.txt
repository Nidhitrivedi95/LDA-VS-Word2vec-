yIBeZebnXb-hvexqknnDCg If you're over 65 and you want to feel important, this is a great spot for you and your significant other. If you have common sense, you know there are better places to spend this kind of money in Charlotte for high caliber dishes. That being said, all the food was good. Not great, but good. One strange thing happened, our meal was paid for in advance by a friend and we were offered wine by our server. Turns out, that wine was not included and was a $300 bottle. A heads up would have been nice before they popped the cork and handed us the check: That was shady McNinch House. I've eaten all over the world never had that "miscommunication." Also, don't go around back side of the restaurant- it's not pretty like the front. It's all for show I guess. Sigh.
