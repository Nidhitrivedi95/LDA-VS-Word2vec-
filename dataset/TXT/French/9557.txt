4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Love this place. I'd read good things about it before my first trip to Vegas but didn't make it that time -- too many other places to try. Finally visited this past weekend and wasn't disappointed.

We were lucky enough to score a table outside, albeit off to the side and not directly across from the Bellagio. We were still able to enjoy the spectacle of the fountains, though -- highly recommended. Fun people-watching. I loved that we were able to make our reservation through Open Table, too. And we had perhaps one of the nicest waiters I've ever had the pleasure of being served by; I think her name may have been Christina, and she had short, blonde hair. She brought me a profiterole with a candle in it for my birthday, yay!

Loved the warm baguette and butter to start. Nice! I ordered the mussels in a broth made with ale for my appetizer, and I loved this dish -- those bivalves were among the best I've ever had, plump and infused with flavor. The scallops gratinee that I ate as my entree were good, too, although the cheese-lover in me would've liked more topping. Unfortunately, J.'s steak was nowhere near as good as the piece of meat we'd enjoyed at Craftsteak, but that may have had to do with the particular cut of the meat. Tasty, different-style frites, pretty thin but not super-crisped. Delicious green beans on the side, prepared simply but with care. My profiterole was good,  even though I don't normally order them, and I loved, loved, loved the bananas foster crepe.

An excellent birthday dinner!
