T4g4k2OhCTsiqcP-ZXElHQ WOW this place is PACKED.

They serve ceveche !!! Tons of great options for sandwiches , appetizers, and entrees! All at a relatively reason price.

Tons of people come and indulge in just a glass of wine. The environment was a little more than a bistro. I love how it's a more casual hang out spot considering it's french food and normally they're a tad fancier.
