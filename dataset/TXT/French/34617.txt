HojKatUfX4UHWaPqtl63NQ To be honest, this place was oversold and overrated.  The best things were the views and atmosphere.  Our expectations were fairly high being that it is an Alain Ducasse restaurant and to be honest it was underwhelming.  There were a few dishes that i would say were good- and really the only memorable one was the ox cheek pasta.  Other than that everything was just OK or not good.  Do not get the eggplant caviar or the gnochi.  the server pushed the gnochi on us saying that it was the best thing on the menu and it was not good at all.  it was lukewarm and flavorless.  My friends ordered the foie gras which they said was not good at all.  They ordered the filet mignon as well which they said was "good."  All in all for the prices I would probably never come back here again because the food was overall underwhelming and not impressive.
