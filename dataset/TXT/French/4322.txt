Fish soup was tasty but too salty, 3 of us could not finish one octopus lentils appetizer since it felt like it was frozen for days, hanger steak was only okay, there was nothing special in French fries and the chocolate cake had too much cacao (I have to admit that we have been told about that by the waiter). Wine selection was pretty good though.

In a nutshell, none of what we ordered was "great" and you can easily find better places in NYC if you spend $300 for a party of 3.
