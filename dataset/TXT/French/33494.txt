hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA After having eaten here a few more times I can definitely say without a doubt this is my favorite casual dining restaurant in the valley. 
I work nearby so I often grab breakfast or lunch there. My go to is the parfait which may seem pretty standard but theirs is anything but. It's unflavored yogurt, some kind of jam or preserves for flavor as well as random fresh fruits. The granola they use on top has pepitas in it as well as flax seeds and other crispy delicious goodness. The parfaits are different every time. Sometimes it'll have sliced grapes and strawberries, other times I've gotten banana and watermelon! It's always phenomenal. 
For lunch they always have new soups every day, they're always spectacular. Their cream of asparagus soup and gazpacho is my favorite. 
I've had a few of their salads and my favorite by far is their Greek. Is a huge salad with black olives, cucumber, tomato, red onion, feta and the Greek dressing is bomb. It also comes with soft, warm pita slices and home made hummus! It's seriously amazing. 
the staff is always amazingly friendly and enthusiastic about their jobs. You can tell the food was made with a lot of love and passion. It's not that forced customer service friendly either, it's real, authentic kindness. Definitely eat here if you get the chance.
