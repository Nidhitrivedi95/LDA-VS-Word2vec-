LI2gZ017EM3_5gy8Z1QR9w We celebrated a friend's/coworker's birthday here as a large group. While the service was timed to luxuriate with one's company and with each course, the pace could have stood to been picked up a bit.  We were there for a full 3-4 hours. Everything, from drinks to appetizers to desserts, was exquisite and incredible. I shared a prosciutto-wrapped melon appetizer and it was melt-in-your-mouth amazing. I wanted to order the venison rack special, but they ran out of it by 8:00 pm (?!). Instead, I ordered the lamb shank entrée and it was succulent and flavourful. I sampled the scallop ceviche, which was divine with cilantro and lime. Shared the bread pudding with caramel sauce for dessert and I wanted to horde the entire portion for myself. It was warm bliss on a plate. If I wasn't at a fancy place, I'd have loved to lick the plate clean.

Pricey, but well worth it. I'd go back for an occasion in a heartbeat!
