I really enjoyed my food. The poached oysters were amazing!! I was hesitant about this dish, but we all loved it. Like raw oysters, but more perfect. Tried both foi gras, excellent also. The scallops were well prepared and nothing else was anything to write home about. Service was good, not fantastic. I think it was more attentive than friendly, and I had to ask for things more than once...water with no ice took three tries and about 15 minutes, but I think they were busy and it was a fluke. It did prevent the experience from being 5 stars though...
