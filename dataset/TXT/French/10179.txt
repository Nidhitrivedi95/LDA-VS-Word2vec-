4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw No doubt about it -- this is my favorite place to eat in Las Vegas and, in fact, it might be my favorite place to eat in the entire country.

I don't speak French or know much about French culture, but I love Paris and its tradition of long, lingering meals outdoors over glass after glass of wine.  Some French restaurants in America try to recreate this tradition, but none does it as well as Mon Ami Gabi.  I eat here every time I go to Vegas.

If you go, you must get a table outside.  This will probably mean a wait of more than an hour, but it's absolutely essential.  Directly across the street from the Bellagio, you'll have front-row seats for their famous water show.  You'll also be sitting in the shadow of the famed Eiffel Tower (Vegas version), and it's a prime spot for people-watching.

The food and the service are both outstanding.  Purists criticize the food for its lack of authenticity.  I can't speak to that, but can say that the food they DO serve is fantastic -- the chicken liver mousse is to die for, their steak roquefort is seasoned and cooked to perfection, and I absolutely love their light, crispy frites.  The wait staff is attentive without being obtrusive, and there's never an attempt to rush you away, no matter how long you've been nursing that final glass of wine.

This place is perfect for both a romantic dinner for two, or a raucous dinner party of 12.  More than a meal, it's a dining experience!
