Our waiter gave us the most attentive service I've ever received. He made sure we had everything we needed. The second I turned my head around in search of his service he was right there to help us out. We even enjoyed Crème brûlée complementary of the restaurant. This was a wonderful dining experience and perfect for a date. Great atmosphere, best steak I've had, great service.
