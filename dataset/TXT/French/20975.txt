AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw The food is ok, but the customer experience needs improvement. We ordered a bunch of coffees and crepes here on a NY Eve. There were two ladies working there. The one made us crepes and the other one was supposed to make a coffee. I asked where can I get my coffee and she answered "I'll make it". And she didn't. She just started to work with the next customer and then the next one. I asked again where is my coffee. She said she'll make it. I've already got the crepes, but still didn't get coffees. It seems like she ignored us on purpose. I got our coffee only after several minutes.
