4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw We ate here twice for brekky, the place has a nice vibe. Good view of the fountains at Bellagio, even if you sit inside, it's like an atrium so you dont feel stifled. The service was nice and relaxed, but still attentive. The food is well prepared, filling, but not heavy. The house champagne is a light and crisp brut. Im a fan! Will be going back before we leave Vegas this time ;p
