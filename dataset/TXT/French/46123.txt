myJ6pgIhN42EQh2sAVXKoQ Went to this burger place after work and surprise to see it empty.

I am not a fan of wait service for a burger joint or eating a burger with a knife and fork, but I decided to stay, since I was curious about their burger.

Ordered "The Classic" with fries.  The burger was disappointing, the meat was dry and over cooked.  I didn't like the bun either, it was a little dense and heavy for me.

Food 2/5
Service 3/5
Ambiance 4/5

I would not go back.
