7Ug8zCmY6iDTewxWqeYQ2g One of the best restaurant I have been to this year! The flavour of the food is amazing and it is a byow!!!

Had their beef tartare to start and he flavour was so well balanced. Rabbit as mum aim dish and it blew my mind...I had rabbit a few times before but nothing as tasty as throne I had here. The dessert was also pretty good...not overly sweet.

Service was also very good. Not one of the cheapest restaurant in town but definitely worth spending the money!

I highly recommend it and will surely be back :)
