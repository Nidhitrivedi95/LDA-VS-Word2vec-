y8Y8l5MVX58gIUCgJLm2jQ We absolutely loved our meal at Les Cocottes. We were greeted by the waitress as soon as we walked in the door. We were the only people in the place, so we were actually a bit worried about the lack of diners. Thankfully, we decided to give it a try anyway.

The waitress was incredibly friendly and welcoming. She chatted to us about our trip to Montréal and explained to us what a cocotte was. 

We weren't sure which wine to order, so for fun the waitress brought us 2 glasses of wine but didn't tell us what each was so that we could do a blind tasting and decide without prejudice. 
This is just another reason we thought she was a great server.

We started with the house made fois gras, which was absolutely delicious. It was served with a fig jam which was also delicious. Our son tried the poutine, which was a huge serving and very good with plenty of gravy and cheese curds.

For entrée, my husband had the beef tartare which was the best we've ever tasted. It was seasoned to perfection with what tasted like a mustardy flavour and served with a delicious little side salad.

My son and I both had the 'mountains cocotte' which was quite like a potato gratin with bacon and also served with a delicious side salad. The cocottes were fantastic. So incredibly tasty and piping hot.

What a wonderful experience we had at Les Cocottes. If we find ourselves in this part of Montréal again we will most definitely return and will continue to tell everyone about this little gem of a restaurant.
