AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw Bistro Review -

The summer tasting menu is a steal!  Lunch size appropriate appetizer - Caprese salad, a nice flaky, tender halibut filet, and a finish of granita/sorbet in a sweet rhubarb sauce - all for $19!

Anyhow, my girls got the actual breakfast - quiche and eggs, while I opted for the tasting menu.  The halibut was cooked medium rare, and served in a tiny casserole pot, complete with thinly sliced potato and tomato, in a beautiful presentation.  The butter was over the top, but I hardly ever consume it, surely it's okay?

Espresso is delightful - strong, crisp, slightly acidic....mmmmmm.......

I had the iced latte from the patisserie on the day we left and it was a bit disappointing.  More milky than strong, but still delicious.  I wish I had gotten a sandwich, but having a one hour flight wouldn't be wise to spend $10 on a sandwich.
