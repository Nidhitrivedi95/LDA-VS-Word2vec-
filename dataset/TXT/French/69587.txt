WOd8tWsh2Yt_osHv-ngx_w A fine option for breakfast or lunch downtown. Huge menu of sandwiches, breakfasty goods like eggs/benedicts, waffles, crepes, etc. Plus tasty liquid refreshment like juices/smoothies, coffees, etc.

I came on a Saturday afternoon and didn't have a wait at all, even though it was definitely pretty busy. Got a tasty juice of strawberries, mango, banana, yogurt, honey, and cranberries. So good! For my meal I went with the strawberry breakfast combo which was 2 eggs, potatoes, crepes with strawberries, and toast. Huge portions and a ton of variety for just $12. Those combos are totally the way to go if you want something sweet AND savory.  And everything was perfectly cooked and tasty. 

Service was quick and nice enough. The space is bright and light. It does get a bit loud when busy, so just an FYI. A woman in the party next to me was clearly very hungover and didn't seem too thrilled by the volume. Ha!
