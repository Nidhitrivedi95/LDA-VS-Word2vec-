hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA Now this is a gem, and worth the little trek off the Strip.  Tired of all the noise and the lights and looking for a little French island of great food (sandwiches, salads and soups) and coffee?  This is the place to go !  Olivier, the owner is so very friendly, explains everything to you and seems to be genuinely happy to run his place.  So inspiring !

It's a little bit hard to find, but some nice yelper made a map you should consider when you want to find this gem (under photos).  The food is mostly sandwiches, soups and salads, but made to French perfection.  Be sure to check out the special sandwiches (for example curry and a Moroccan sandwich were on the menu today) as well as their daily soup.  Get a sandwich with a side salad or a sandwich and a soup.  To round it off, get an Illy espresso and a pain au chocolate.  I cried it was so good...
