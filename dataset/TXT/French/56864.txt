rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Following the tradition of quality restaurants in Northern California, Thomas Keller hasn't let the good people of Las Vegas down.  Just like most higher-end restaurants in Vegas, Bouchon has a perfectly designed interior to match the theme of their food.  If it isn't too windy, try sitting outdoors on their patio next to the fountain.  The food was amazing from beginning to the end.  Service was a little slow, but the place was packed.

Run down of what I ordered and all of it I recommend:
-Petit Plateau 
(1/2 lobster, 9 oysters, 3 shrimp, 3 clams, 6 mussels)
"I can't imagine it getting any fresher than this in Vegas."
-Pt de Campagne 
(country style pt with watercress, cornichons & radishes)
"Kinda of like liverwurst from the can, but 1000 times better!"
-Steak Frites 
(Medium Rare with caramelized onions and seasoned slab of butter on top)
"Cooked to & flavored to perfection, tender and clean tasting."
-Moules au Safran et  la Moutarde 
(Maine bouchot mussels steamed in white wine, Pt de Campagne avec Roquefort et aux Noix mustard & saffron, served with french fries)
"If you like mussels, well you get 30-35 mussels excellently prepared in a butter saffron base."
-Madagascar Creme Brulee'  (special for the night)
"Creamy with a layer of vanilla bean particles lining the bottom."
-Free French mini pastries and a bag of caramelized popcorn to go!!!
-A perfectly matched gurtziminer for the 1st half and pinor noir for the 2nd half of the meal.

I'm drooling thinking about this meal!  This is a Las Vegas MUST EAT!!!!
