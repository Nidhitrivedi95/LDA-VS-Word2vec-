This is the first time that I got more than what I expected with a voucher, how unexpected! It said two coffees and two pastries, but the server invited us to order anything from the breakfast or even the lunch menu, since it was nearing 11 am. For a cafe in Yorkville, I was thrilled that we were treated so nicely. Because of this, I'd definitely consider visiting the Nespresso Cafe again to stock up on pods for family members, or to enjoy a fancy drink with a friend. The prices for food weren't outrageous, and I really enjoyed my grilled cheese with figs and balsamic vinaigrette. Can't wait to go back!
