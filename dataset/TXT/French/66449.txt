uP3H5bcsiTXM0k0xQhRndg It was our first wedding anniversary. My wife and I were visiting Montreal for the first time. On our last night in the city, we were exhausted from sightseeing all day and decided to have dinner in. We were staying at an Airbnb around the block from the restaurant. When I popped-in to place the order, I was met by the most charming hostess. While multitasking, she graciously took my order, making recommendations and engaging me in conversation. I returned within 20 minutes and the order was ready. (The restaurant was busy, so this was impressive.) She even surprised us by giving us a complimentary homemade dessert order to celebrate our anniversary. The food was to die for! The favors were complex and the presentation was beautiful. Don't miss out on this place!
