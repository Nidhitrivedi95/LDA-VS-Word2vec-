xaqW4NkmUCGRRjmLxiFJ6Q I pretty much signed up for Yelp to write this review, so that says a lot about this place already. Wonder how long before this review is buried beneath a bunch more 5 star reviews. Read on.

Crepes were pretty damn tasty. I had a Big Bird (Basically a Turkey Bacon horseradish crepe) and my friend had a Philly Cheesesteak crepe. They were served piping hot in neat tearaway cardboard wrappers. Crepes were very light, not eggy, not too sweet and quite delicate. Way better than some other crepe places I've tried on Queen street.

Also had the fresh pressed Sugarcane juice. WOW! If you're thinking of coming here you should order this....kinda hard to believe something so delicious can come from squeezing a plant. On a side note, why is this so hard to find in Toronto? People don't know what they're missing!!

There was one thing that made a **** into  ******. THE SERVICE. 

Spoke to one of the owners, Ramin. You can really hear the excitement and passion in his voice when he talked about everything about the place from their proprietary crepe recipe that took several months to nail, the design of the wrappers to their custom built sugarcane juice/presser. You have to give credit to a business that really believes in their product and isn't just trying to make a fast buck.

HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend trying this place out, will be back to try the dessert crepes and the coffee.
