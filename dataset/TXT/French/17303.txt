9iy6scMRbs5ue41XRLGEkw One of my favorite restaurants!  The food has been, and continues to be rich, flavorful, and consistent. The new building manages to keep the familiar charm of the old site, but adds a new, modern flair. The addition of the bar is great for those wanting a drink after work, and the selection of cocktails and wine are perfectly paired to the sumptuous offerings.

The best part of the restaurant is the staff. Ron is always so courteous, and Andrea's attention and grace pale in comparison to her fashion sense. I've never seen a shirt with a seam running up the back worn in such a fierce fashion.

If you haven't eaten there, you're missing one of the greatest joys in life, ya dum dum. GO DO IT!
