kcF-en40P3J9L8nLy5lKqQ I love this place for breakfast and lunch, hands down one of the better places in greater Phoenix. The service is awesome, the selection of beers is great, sitting at the bar is easy and the food is amazing (plus they have one hell of a hipster twist on Chicken & Waffles). The only downside is the price, and I think their dinner menu could use a bit more selection; and last time I came here for dinner I enjoyed my salmon but was not a big fan of the gnocchi. I would say it's a 4 star place, but the decor and service pushes it up to at least a 4.5 star.
