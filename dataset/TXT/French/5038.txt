36pB0QVVNZuOLV_UxosbAQ I really enjoy this place - both the Atwater joint and their permanent location (though I've only done delivery from the latter). They stick to their basics and execute them solidly. If you liked slow cooked, somewhat stew- or curry-like comfort dishes, I think you'll be satisfied here. Price is very reasonable. People are extremely nice. One quibble: I'd take a pass on their samosas though - the low point among their options.
