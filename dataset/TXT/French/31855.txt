They feature a wide variety of "french style" baked good and a pretty decent menu for dining. They bake a lot of cheese  cakes: lemon, NY, Mango, Mocha, Mixed Fruit, Green Tea, Chocolate Grand Marnier, and Strawberry.

The also have the standards: Saint Honore, Viennese Chocolate, Chestnut Cake (layered with imported chestnut puree), and a slew of differently flavoured meringue cakes.

This is the place to take your date or significant other for some deep soulful looks, as you contemplate the universe, or more prosaically, the next few hours to come. Just like Soma, (no sexism intended), it is more a 'chick's place' than a man's. I tried to propose there, it's that kind of place.

But if you have a sweet tooth give them a whirl. I am partial to the fruit flan and the hazelnut chocolate mousse.
