DJcvnN7BCiqOUAra35xYuA I read the previous reviews here, and I hoped it was a fluke. Sad to say it wasn't. After being to many pho restaurants around town, Rice paper is by far the worst.

It's quasi pho. Semi pho. The Diet Coke of pho. Just one calorie, not pho enough.

Seriously though. The food isn't that good. What normally costs $6.85 or $7.25 for a small bowl at other places is $14 here for a large.

The broth is terrible. It tastes to be made out of bullion .. salty and flavorless. 

The spring rolls are 1 (ONE) for $6.00. And it's half lettuce.

I came. I tried. I was disappointed. I want my money back .
