8ciT6qjI18x9EPtOb-gqYQ We went for the Valentines Day dinner.  It was cute, really nice and more food in one sitting than I have had in a long time.  It was pricey but worth it in my eyes.  We brought our own wine we purchased in Sonoma and were saving for a special night.

Service was wonderful.  The ambiance is romantic and sweet.  The brie was so good, I could have just eaten the entire plate and been completely satisfied but of course, I had soup, the main dish, dessert and wine.  

Great place for a romantic date.
