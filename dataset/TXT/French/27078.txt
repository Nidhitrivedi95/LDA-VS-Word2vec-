Dcj69NZJnbJhK-YHP_nULA This restaurant used to be so much more! It's still a good place for a drink, but the food is mediocre and overpriced.  Had the croque monsieur and I won't be ordering that again.  The frites need work.  Unfortunately, I won't be eating here again unless the quality of the food improves.
