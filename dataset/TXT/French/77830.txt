YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g We had dinner there and it is a big must NO go. If you want bread it's $15 ,very average food coupled with service that you would expect at Denny's.  Yes he is Thomas Keller's brother but that's where it ends.
Stay far away there are way to many fine dining spots just right around the corner.
