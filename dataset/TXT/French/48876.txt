oJZNHz5UUVUgrZwVBVlpYw Came here during CES 2016 week. This time around the food i had was good and the server was amazing. As for the two hostess, they need a training on etiquettes of how to treat a customer.  

Anywho, after a couple of glasses of Moet champagne, the duck charuterie plate and an order of shrimp & crab cocktail, I was relaxed and unwind from the crazy week of meetings.

This place does have its charm and still some hit and miss.
