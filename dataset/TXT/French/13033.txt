4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw My wife and I had a great dining experience at Mon Ami Gabi. Compared to the other restaurants in that area of the strip (and considering it's location), their prices were reasonable. We've dined at Eiffel Tower before and their prices were double than Mon Ami Gabi which was just below it. 

The hostess was gracious and was precise about how much time we had to wait. We've made reservations earlier that day through Yelp using Opentable (highly suggest this for any reservations anywhere) and they saw all of our requests such as a table outside facing the strip with a heater. The weather on the night we dined was fairly mild combined with an excellent view of the Bellagio Fountain made up for a truly unforgettable dining experience. The food was superb. My wife and I both had steaks and they were cooked right down to how we requested it. We had a Large Carafe of Sangria which paired perfectly with our entree. For desert, gotta have the chocolate cake. It is superb. 

The only negative about this review and the reason why I only give it for 4 stars was the waiter. He was okay but we expected more coming from a restaurant such as Mon Ami Gabi. Maybe he just had a bad day. He was not rude but his service was just plain and bland and when we asked about his opinion on which steak to order he just said, whatever you want! I think the better response would have been to explain what the different steaks were, how they were cooked and what made them special. I expected a better knowledge on the menu and explaining it to the customer rather than letting the customer figure out the menu. But overall, the experience was very nice. And for the Mon Ami Gabi management if you're reading this, re-train some of your servers so your diners will have the best dining experience. In fairness to the other servers, again, I think our server maybe just had a bad day because everyone else seemed nice.
