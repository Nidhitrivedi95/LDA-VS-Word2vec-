WOj8nPos3R9IIf0Pyttd8g First visit to Lulu's... yummy.  Monday night, Restaurant Week ... not busy at all.  Tiny little tables, wide open room, I wanted to look around and make sure I wasn't speaking too loudly.  I am not sure if hubs would have been thrilled with the ambience but it was great for a girls' night out.

If you are a calamari fan ... order the calamari!  Ginger calamari served with a spicy slaw.  Wow.  My friend ordered the French Onion Soup - it could probably be a meal, way too big for an appetizer.  Dinner was very good - I ordered the Haddock Capitaine which, according to the menu, is not actually haddock, but rather cod.  Perhaps they think haddock and cod are the same fish... they are not.  But I digress. The meal was just ever so slightly over-salted.  But I am kind of a salt fan so no complaints here.  

The creme brulee was a little creamier than I am used to - however, once again, how can anyone complain about creme brulee?  Delicious!  I ate it all.  

The Restaurant Week Menu said there would be an Amuse Bouche - Chef's Choice - while I am not a fan of bread hanging out on the table to help us pass the time, I was actually looking forward to an Amuse Bouche.  Alas, no such luck.  We just stared at each other for a little while over our stark white tablecloths trying not to chitchat too loudly and patiently awaiting our appetizers.  Not sure if I misread the menu or if they were trying to make us extra hungry before dinner.  

I would definitely go back... perhaps to order a Burger ... the burger with pimento cheese and pommes frites sounded delicious and reasonably priced.  Not sure I will rush back here for a nice dinner out.
