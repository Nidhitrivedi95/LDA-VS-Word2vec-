I wanted a burger so I got the Bison burger. I forgot to say how I wanted it cooked and it came out rare-my fault-but I would have preferred it cooked more. The poutine is different than other restaurants (up-charge with the burger) and I got a delicious side of Brussels sprouts. All in all very good!
I would definitely go back if in Montreal again.
