Service was amazing too. 

Only negative : They did take about 45 minutes for our entrees to be served following the appetizers (about an hour from ordering).. It wasn't peak dinner time and restaurant wasn't busy so not sure why it took so long (we went in around 8:45 and ordered by 9 and got our entrees at 10). We were both exhausted and starving so that kinda ruined our dinner.
