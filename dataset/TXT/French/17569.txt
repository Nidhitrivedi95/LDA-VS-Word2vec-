9ot8oInkYZTt6wkkGe__vQ Had an amazing experience here for my anniversary. My date had arranged for flowers to be placed at the table prior to us arriving and they were beautiful. They also printed personal menus for us and presented them to us at the end with a red ribbon. Service was amazing, with quite attentive staff and knowledgeable servers who were each well versed with the menu items and ingredients. 
We both had the chefs tasting menu (5course meal) with wine pairing. Each plate was beautifully presented and tasted delicious beginning with an amuse bouche. My favourite was the BC scallop in seafood bouille and the 45day aged steak was cooked to perfection with equally delicious trimmings. All in all it was an amazing night and completed my list of OB experiences on a high note. We will most likely be back on our next special occasion~  Thank you again to the lovely chefs and staff at this restaurant for making our night so delightful!
