RMLdpPgaYUsa9LIS7UnTNQ I personally really liked the macarons with sprinkles on top, the other's taste and texture were fairly good, but not the best ones I've haf. The location of the shop had many comfortable seats and is a great setting for lunch. In addition, it was really convenient to find as it was right outside King Station. The packaging of the box was average however with a simple brown box.
