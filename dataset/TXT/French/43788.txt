m9aFZk1f8tSv248YErbpQA Great place for crepes, although not as good as the crepe bar. 

The chocolate croissant was very good. The French toast amazing. The iced tea very good. However maybe we are more used to the crepe bar's crepes which are much more flavorful and the crepe itself much more light and crispy which my wife and I prefer. Here the crepes are made with buckwheat which may be more authentic but are a but too thick and heavy for the inside ingredients to shine thru like at the crepe bar. 

We will be back but for crepes we prefer the crepe bar.
