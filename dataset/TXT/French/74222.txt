xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g I made reservations and requested a table with a view ahead of time. With only two people it's very easy to get a table looking over the Bellagio fountain. I thought this place was going to be breaking the bank but it's honestly reasonably price for the quality of the food. The staffs were also beyond amazing. And lastly you HAVE TO get the soufflé!
