A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g If I were to buy a birthday cake in Vegas, this is where it would be. When you enter you see the large assortment of pastries, sweets, and cakes that are gorgeous. I think it is 5 stars in terms of presentation on the cakes. They are something you would want to take a picture of, they are so pretty. Very colorful and great to bring to parties or special occasions. 

Their macarons taste good but are flaky and large, good price. 

I have tried their sandwiches and soups and I enjoy them too. I like the brie one with pickles and butter on the bread. Forget your diet here! All of the food is covered in cheese and you can see how fattening it looks. I have never tried their quiches or other cheesy items showcased for display where you order. They look good.
