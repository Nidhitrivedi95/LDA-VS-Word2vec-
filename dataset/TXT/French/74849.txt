Xw50tINqzrI_BM_x7_IcZA This place is fabulous.  

As soon as the girl taking my order realized i could speak french, our conversation was toute en francais.  she even helped me with my grammar.  it was really cute.

i got simple: une crepe avec du beurre et canelle (butter and cinnammon).  

my first crepe a go go experience was in yorkville.  

such an amazing idea, and the owner is from France.  

I'll be back.  

merci!!
