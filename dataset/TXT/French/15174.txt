63qPRnFAjxtchnSTWBxwbw I am HUNGRY!!! I want Poutine! 

Frites Alors! really hit the spot. Large Poutine Vladimir ($10) is great to share as late night snack.. the cheese curds.. I love Cheese!! Fries is cooked just right crispy outside and mushy inside...and with just the right amount of gravy!

Maybe after a drink or 2 and another beer to go with the poutine, it makes everything perfect!.

Service is efficient and friendly.

I think I am starting to entertain the idea of having Poutine and Beer as my snack of choice!

I wish I can find good Poutine in Toronto..................
