w2tr0PA0b3tg8pId0kjM-A I tried the Lemon Tart and the Pear Cheesecake.All I have to day for both is, it was dangerously delicious and taste like your eating pastry from a true chef! the crumb bottom of both was crumby enough, the tart had just the right amount of tart and the cheesecake was nothing  but creamy awesomeness. This place is pricey but I PROMISE, you will not regret trying any of the pastries.

I also had some Macarons and although the texture was executed well, the flavors missed the mark as they were very faint.
 
Macaron flavors I tried:

Raspberry 
Pistachio 
Almond 
Poopy 
Nougatine 
Passion fruit
White Basil
Pineapple

Raspberry and Pineapple were the only flavors I could taste (slightly). Service was service. Young lady serving us looked snobbish and as if she needed a Pepsi to wake her up (I hate soda/Pepsi by the way)
