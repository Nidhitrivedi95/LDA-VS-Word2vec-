rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I've been to Boucon in Yountville and I was interested in trying the Vegas outpost.   The food was just lovely.  The service was over the top.  Our waiter gave absolutely poetic descriptions of all the specials.  This location is very quiet compared to Yountville.  It's a bit hidden away inside the Venetian which is especially nice if you'd like a quiet meal away from the chaos of the strip.
