xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g The environment is great: great view, beautiful restaurant, good tasting food. The char broiled fillet would have been a 10 if it wasn't so burnt on the outside. They could have left it sitting in some of it's juices for 56 dollars.

For the amount I paid for the fillet, chicken, and side of potatoes ($128 including tip), I expected better service from my waiter. His description of the fillet when I asked about how it comes, "It's literally a piece of meat on a plate", didn't sound very appetizing. When he asked if I wanted a side of potatoes, he never even told me how they would come. (They ended up being potatoes au gratin) Again, the fillet was burnt on the outside which didn't make me too happy.

For that kind of money, I want excellent service.
