cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg Au Pied de Cochon is one of Montreals finest dining establishments! Inspired to visit by an episode of Anthony Bourdain's No Reservations, my husband stopped in while in Montreal for a business trip. He raved about the food so much that on his next trip, I joined him and we had reservations for our final night in town. Too eager to wait, we went twice on our trip. 

DAY 1:
We had tarragon bison tongue, followed by their famous trotter, a deep fried pigs leg stuffed with veggies served on a bed of cheese infused mashed potatoes the consistency of cheese pizza, topped with foie gras. It was amazing!

DAY 2:
Hungry for more we went BACK to AuPied for dinner and had some more amazing food- the highlight being foie gras cromquisse (spelling) - which was a foie gras stuffed hush puppie/fritter that was deep fried. You had to eat it in one bite and all the liquified foie gras came squirting out. We followed that with their beet/goat cheese salad which could have been a dessert, and it was so rich and so gorgeously presented. (it had beautiful greens and even a little lavender flower bud and then drizzled along side was beet puree.) Obviously our entrees were just as good, he had the PDC meatloaf and I had the PDC Melting Pot a porktastic selection of different meats on top of a bowl of the famous mashed potatoes. 

We each had a glass of wine, then went ahead and ordered a $67 bottle of Cote du Rhone, our three apps, two entrees and dessert, the bill came out to about $160. Unfreakingbelievable! - considering the quality of the food.

Thanks Anthony Bourdain for being right on the money about this place and thanks Au Pied de Cochon for existing in the first place!
