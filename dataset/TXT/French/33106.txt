La Gargote is a quaint little restaurant, great ambiance.  I ordered the homemade cannoli with rabbit and lamb.  It isn't an option I'd normally see on a menu here in the states (based on the restaurants I usually frequent) but since this was vacation, I wanted to try something different.  It was very good. I forget the type of sauce that was included, but the meat was shredded and extremely tender and the sauce complimented the meat perfectly. Our server was great!  He had a great sense of humor, was very attentive and patient with all of us ladies.  I believe he is the owner or son of the owner..  Either way, he made the dining experience even more enjoyable.
