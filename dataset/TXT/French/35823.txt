hvjgF-vnPw2jyL5DBuB0qg I had been looking forward to my visit to Garde Manger my whole trip in Montreal.  It did not disappoint!

I sat at the bar, which I'd highly recommend, as the service is superb!

The bartender presented me with the drink menu, however when I informed him of my preferences, he offered to make a drink for me.  I was happy to take this option, and the drink was fantastic.  I did this the remainder of the meal, and all four drinks I had were terrific, and just what I wanted!

I started my meal with the seafood platter.  I opted for oysters, lobster, and the smoked char.  It was all fresh, and divine.  And just enough for me.

Following the seafood, I decided to just have an appetizer.  I chose the pork belly.  I loved it!

Dessert I had a hard time deciding between the strawberry shortcake and coffee cake, but decided to go with the strawberries since they were in season.  Perfect finish to my meal.

The service and food here are fantastic.  It's a little loud, so if that bothers you, it might not be your place.  Personally, I enjoyed the energy.  I'm already panning my next trip.
