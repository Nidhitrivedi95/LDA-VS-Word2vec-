4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Only took 5 minutes to walk here from our hotel at Caesars palace. Nice that it's right in the heart of the strip. Got seated right away, we had a reservation I made online 20 minutes before, but there wasn't a wait anyways. Server was very friendly and attentive. Coffee, YUM! (And I'm a Seattle coffee snob). We got the eggs Benedict and blueberry French toast. The eggs Benedict was what you would expect, nothing out of the ordinary or over the top. The blueberry French toast was good. The vanilla whip cream that came on the side was Devine. Oh and the blueberry sauce was delish too. Wish I would have asked for the berries on the side because they made the toast a little soggy. Overall thought it was really good. We had our food within like 5 minutes of ordering. Oh another note, the orange juice is fresh and really good. Also they bring you a little warm banquette, brought me right back to Paris! Lovely breakfast.
