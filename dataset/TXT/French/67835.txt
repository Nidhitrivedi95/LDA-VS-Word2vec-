V-GKJwamXPIxSwecZdcPYw This place has the potential for 5 stars but not as is today!!! We live 5 min away and after reading the reviews we were soo exited to try a place where we could became regulars, we walked in and the place looks super cozy and nice , here is one star!! The music was amazing , there was live music and was really great!!! That is my other star!!! The service was the worst I had n a long time, the waitress was careless , never checked on us, plates were Piling on our table, my husband got a bacon cheese burger, she forgot the bacon and didn't even said sorry, the burger was aww , nothing great , we had fried calamari , was blend and we didn't even get a wedge of lemon they advertised is served with on the menu!! But it was so hard to get attention from the waitress we were done before she came back. I had the chicken Parmesan , and for what I read on the other reviews I was expecting it to be good, pasta was overcooked , chicken was soggy and took me 10 min to get the waitress to bring me Parmesan cheese, and when she did she slammed it on the table like she was angry she had to go grate it or something!!! And last of all, the garlic knots sucked!!!! They brought 4 out for a table of 3 and they where ok, a little heavy but fresh, we asked for some more and I think they were from the day before reheated, it was steal . Well all I have to said is I won't be a regular here, and they need some management checking on the staff because service was terrible!!!
