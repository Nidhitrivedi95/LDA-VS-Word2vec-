mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q I've been here a few times, and this last time was superb. My bf brought me here to celebrate valentine's day and it was an extraordinary experience. We did the tasting menu and the wine pairing, and the whole meal was flawless. I would say that my favorite dish was the scallop and truffle tart; sublime! I love the L'atelier locations because they are so modern and sexy, and it was a perfect place to celebrate vday :). Can't wait to come back again.
