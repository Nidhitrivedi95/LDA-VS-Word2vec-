xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g Came for brunch! This place was absolutely beautiful! This place was a great place to enjoy a beautiful brunch while in Vegas. My companion has remarkable taste in restaurants and always picks the cream of the crop. The scene was breathtaking. We sat by the window and had a great view overlooking the waterfall at the Bellagio.

We started out with shrimp cocktail for an appetizer. The shrimp were fresh and succulent. It definitely seemed as if the shrimp were caught fresh that day. The food was served with some french bread. Having recently been to France, I found the bread to be quite authentic. For my meal I had the french toast with a side of bacon.  The french toast had a delectable apple swirl atop of the french toast.  My friend had the eggs Benedict. As a lover of eggs Benedict he seemed to be pleased. 

This place is definitely a place that we would come visit again when return to Vegas. While they say what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas, it doesn't apply to great food.... for that must be shared.
