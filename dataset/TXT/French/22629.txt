bzbNGyrTwWHAgg1CqkSgeg Terrance Cafe is such an awesome place. The staff is very welcoming and the restaurant is inviting. I thought it was so nice that they had upstairs seating which overlooked the whole restaurant. Although this place is known for their brunch I ordered from the lunch menu. I order some type of fried chicken and veggies. My brother ordered the same thing but subbed the veggies out for a salad. When my brother got his check the price of subbing the salad was the full price of the salad. When asking the Server about it she took off $2. The portions aren't very big so if you have a big Appetite like myself this may not be the place for you. Over all the food was good along with the service.
