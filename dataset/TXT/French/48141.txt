O66Zy8Y13VBm72ZDhS4fIg We decided to go here for Winterlicious on Saturday and we surely made the right choice!

We sat by the window on comfy sofas (based on request) and each of us ordered different meals.

Really enjoyed the trout and chocolate dessert! The portions were larger than expected (considering it's French) so it was easily sharable.

You can tell that the staffs are extremely professional, when the timing of every food coming in and being cleared out is perfect. So flawless. Had a wonderful time chatting up with my girl friends :)
