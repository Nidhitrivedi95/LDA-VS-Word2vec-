I went with a wedding party and was so impressed with the service, the delicious food and the relatively affordable prices that I went back the next night. 
Our server was a woman named Kathy. She was attentive without hovering, explained her favorite dishes well and was knowledgeable about the food. I have hardly ever been so impressed by restaurant service. 
The prices are steep compared to what I usually am willing to shell out for food, but it's one of the most reasonably priced steakhouses on the strip and the food was better than the several more expensive places we visited. 
We'd had a particularly bad experience the night before we came here over at Mario Battali's B&B, and were concerned that all restaurants at the Venetian might operate similarly. We were very wrong, to our surprise. 
I wish this place was closer so I could make it a special occasion place and visit regularly. 
You have to check it out at least once while you're in Vegas. Like me, though, you'll probably have to go at least twice.
