LQ_gYNs5E10IGFE0NOyD7A We came here twice. The first time we sat in the back and last night since a storm was coming in we sat inside. Had the same waiter, he remembered us from the first time and he even remembered what we ordered and where we sat. We found this place one night when we were driving home from a night out. It's a cute restaurant. Love the outdoor seating. The service is just top notch. I recommend this place to anyone who will ask me. Both times I got the fried chicken with the ssrriranch and it was amazing!!
