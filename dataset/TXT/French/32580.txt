gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg After stepping into Montreal soil for the first time in my life (I'm a Jersey girl), I was ready for some delicious French/Canadian cuisine. My friends and I ended up here for our first Montreal meal. I'm very happy we ate here, because this truly set the bar for the rest of the trip.
This is what I assume to be your typical gastropub in Montreal, but we newcomers were overwhelmed by the menu, atmosphere, beef selection, and everything in between. The service was excellent and very polite and accommodating. And the food was fantastic.
I got an open-faced salmon sandwich (or whatever they called it) and I loved every bite. I'm always looking for new ways to enjoy lochs and cream cheese! I really liked this place and it seemed that the company I was with enjoyed it as well.
