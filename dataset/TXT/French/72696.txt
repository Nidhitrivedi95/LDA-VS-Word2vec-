XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q Amuse Bouche: green apple gelee with mint: 2.5
Bread: basil brioche, bacon bread and natural brioche were pretty good
Foie gras and white truffle shavings in a citrus sauce: 3

Caviar trio
- Hamachi with vinegar radish and caviar: 3.5, good but vinegar overpowers the caviar
-salmon tartare with caviar:3.5, caviar overpowers the tartare at times
-cauliflower velouté with caviar: 3.5 pretty good

Pan seared scallop in green curry: 4.25 yummy, deep flavors but a little too rich

Mushroom trio:
-porcini mushroom w parsnip: 3, the mushroom flavor is a little too much
- daikon truffle ravioli: 1.5, a waste of truffle. Don't know what's going on with this dish 
-matsutake saffron infusion; 2.5

There were more dishes but I didn't write them down as the meal progressed. Overall, nothing was impressive. Everything was good or pretty good. Not work the money IMO.

The service is wonderful. If you call ahead of time, they will pick you up at your hotel with the MGM gold limo for free. The limo then takes you to the back part of the hotel which has gardens and such, which was quite pretty.
