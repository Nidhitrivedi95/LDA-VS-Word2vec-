LjOBNcNNpuewBqSPxYYTJQ I have no idea why Amelie's in Carmel Commons has anything less than four star reviews. I've been to this location (as well as the Noda location) several times and have never had a bad experience. I've ordered pastries, sandwiches, soups, drinks and all have been fantastic.  I actually prefer the atmosphere of the Amelie's in CC because it feels more relaxed and is usually less crowded than the one in Noda (though it has still been busy each time I've been here). Definitely a nice place to sit and catch up with friends or hangout and enjoy lunch.
