i5vxtyiHKYnRcJ0p9N7mLw The food, service, and staff at the Gourmet Deli are all authentic and excellent.  On the wall they have written their full menu on the black board; it is a mix of New York Deli, Southern European cuisine and Italian restaurant.  All of the specialties are created by Carlo, or Emilie and reveal their Italian & French heritage.  
I have been for lunch many times and have enjoyed ordering my favorites that remind me of the New York Deli's I grew up on.  Most recently I have been just ordering the special of the day; today was a French lentil soup created by Emilie and it was wonderful.
The service is very fast, especially considering every dish is created to order.  Over time they have been busier and they seem to have increased their staff to keep up their service level.
