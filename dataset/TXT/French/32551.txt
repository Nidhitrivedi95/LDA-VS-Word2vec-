gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg 4-star rating is more for the experience than the food. Our server was very friendly and welcoming. The whole family ordered the house beers. The special was a raspberry ale, which was great, not sweet just a hint of raspberry. We ordered the Duck Confit Poutine and were waiting a while for it. We received our entrees first and the poutine came after. We were in no rush so it was fine and the poutine was quite good. For my entree, I had the Maxi Chicken Brochette. The tomato sauce and vegetables were good, but the chicken was dry. My family ordered a Flamm, sriracha burger, and traditional burger. The Flamm was great, nice and crispy, while the burgers were okay. Visiting from the US so not sure if this is normal in Canada, but I thought it was odd the server didn't ask how the burger should be cooked and they ended up well done. Ended the meal with a delicious liege waffle and watching Michael Phelps win another gold medal. 

Overall, the family and I enjoyed our time. Our server was gracious and apologetic about the late poutine so we left happy and full.
