t1mR_Zff6Dqv1TueE2JLEA Visited this restaurant with a group of 14 people. We were seated at the front of the restaurant near the door so we were unable to see or participate in the belly dancing so I cannot comment on that.  I ordered a appetizer Maftoul, main Short rib and dessert, rice pudding.  The appetizer Maftoul, arrived barely warm.  The outer pastry was hard and the filling had no particular taste.  Up next was the short rib.  It was a decent sized rib and the meat was very tender, again no real flavor to it and it was very fatty.  Dessert was the highlight of the meal for me.  The rice pudding was excellent--not sure if it was homemade or tinned but it was toothsome.  Thanks to other reviewers I knew well in advance not to order the "Moroccan Treats" which are basically just 2 or 3 store bought variety cookies.  My fellow diners that ordered the "Moroccan Treats" were very disappointed.   Service was OUTSTANDING--our server was Danielle and she was very attentive and pleasant.
