YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g horrible! crowded. tables are so close you rub elbows. poor service. boring food. ridiculous prices for what they offer. i actually saw a woman in a white dress at the table next to us being served a plate that had the sauce dripping from it (needless to say, her dress was ruined and she wasn't happy, they walked out). the sommelier was nowhere to be found. our food came out before our appetizer. the best experience of the entire evening was the busser, he removed our plates right away...it's a shame our dessert took half an hour to arrive (and no it wasn't even a souffle). horrible!
