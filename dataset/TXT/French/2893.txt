0ViMx28wkb0MCrWrs25j_A We went there on a Saturday night and enjoyed it quite a bit

The room is small and quite charming. I do wonder what it would be like more crowded; the tables are pretty close together

Service was pleasant. Server was very nice. She sort of got slammed with three or four tables all at once so was a little slow getting organized, but not annoyingly slow

The food is the high point. My partner prefers steak tartare a nit more minced, not the larger chunks but flavored were nice. The tomato tartare was really nice, fresh and tasty. The mains, I had the steak, we're both delicious. It's a French place, so I had the creme brûlée and it was perfect with a lovely crust and the creamiest inside. My partner had the tart, worth the price alone

Whether a casual couples date dinner or a gathering of friends, this place is worth the trip
