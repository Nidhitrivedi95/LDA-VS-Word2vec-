xcmmTXhuMx2fZF2Bt69F4w I am giving it four stars for the French fries with gravy and cheese. They call it something fancy like cheese curds and pourve something. The bartender was our waitress. The small plate of Mac and cheese was nothing spectacular. The mussels were average. The dessert of a berry crisp was very small in size and disappointing. But if you go for just a cocktail and appetizer, get the French fries. It's worth it just for them.
