sphMzEIqY1I2Dzv3zLZY2g The Global is worth finding. In an area of chain restaurants, it is unique. I recently had to find an unscale restaurant near Ballantyne to host a business dinner for 12.  Some colleagues and I did an initial "site visit" or "test run" as a group of four.  We all agreed it was definitely the place to return for the larger business dinner!  One of my colleagues, who is a real "foodie", proclaimed that it was the best meal he had eaten in Charlotte!  Others, who live in Charlotte, said they did not know about The Global, but would be coming back now that they knew.  Bernard, the owner/chef, worked with me on the larger dinner party to determine a pre-set menu with my choice of wine.  The wine menu, btw, is top of the line!  Not the run of the mill, same old stuff.  Excellent explanations of a variety of bottles you don't see everywhere else. Bernard obviously works with wholesalers who carry something different.  The food and service at The Global are top notch.  Bernard is charming.  See the other reviews for more on the food. The location is truly a bit different, in an office park. It is in a nice area, so don't let that deter you.  If you are tired of chain restaurants, and desire a nice ambience, with interesting, well thought out, excellent food and wine - make reservations for a table at The Global.  Everyone that has been there with me, now has it on their list. You get what you pay for, and the value for what you pay here is well worth it.
