xaqW4NkmUCGRRjmLxiFJ6Q Went there for a late lunch.  Empty at the time.  Service was great, tried their new special, tasted amazing.  Pricey, it was. $12 one, but good.  Other ones seem to start at $8.50.  Good stuff.  Which it was closer to my work place.

Only downside to this would be the wait time if you come at a busy time.
