3jKUbhGSjFTv5jZ0wnW0xA My girlfriend had the tartare, and it was fantastic (I had big-time meal envy). I went for the duck confit which was also great. We got a free drink with our Yelp checkin, so try it out (hopefully it's still on) - they seem to take their cocktails pretty seriously here, and that's something I highly approve of.

I met the owner Val (who's super cool and easy-going) and all the staff I dealt with were friendly.

This would be a great place for causal meal, or a date location.
