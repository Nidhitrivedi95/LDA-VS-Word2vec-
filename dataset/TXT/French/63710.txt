T4g4k2OhCTsiqcP-ZXElHQ late lunch  - they can't substitute ingredients in the crepes because they're "pre-made" (!?) - then they are just plain out of the one i decide to order...then I get a Ceasar salad and ask for fresh parm "we don't do that" says the waitress...huh? bland salad, ugh.  order some fries to give my lunch a bit more kick, they are too pre-made, sort of cold and a bit on the stale side. Would have been a one star but at least the coffee was good and strong.
