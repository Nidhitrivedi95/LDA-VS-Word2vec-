xcmmTXhuMx2fZF2Bt69F4w My wife and I had a wonderful experience here. We came here as we were craving French cuisine like we had enjoyed in Quebec city (Cafe St Malo) and we were not disappointed. I had the baked cassoulet and my wife had the steamed mussels in the regular sauce. Both were perfectly prepared and tasted wonderful. We started with the spinach dip and crustini which was simply devine and the waiter did not hesitate to replenish the crustini until we had savored the last morsel.

We arrived early in the evening (around 5) and only had to wait a couple of minutes for a table, but the wait clearly got longer as the night wore on. The service was pleasant and prompt though, so we did not feel rushed. We cannot wait to return and try many more things on the menu.
