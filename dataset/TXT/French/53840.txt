qnFdBp12seAxwe2_iHM2bA Some restaurants make you feel bad about the decision of coming to them , this is one of them. 

From the non smile unfriendly hostess, to the "blown away "( not in a good way) meal, we've had it all. 

We went there for the MTL à la table évent, we've been several restaurants for the past two years before, and all of them were awesome experiences! Then we decided to give this place a try , unfortunately we regretted it so so so much! 

Skip the "little finger"( literally, tomato salad was just 3 tiny pieces of tomato) portion appetizer, let's talk about the mains. Mine was the cod fish, which tastes like a over-cooked chicken breast, the texture of this delicate fish was totally ruined by the unhappy chef ( I assumed, otherwise I had no idea how a chef could handle cod fish so horribly). And the beef dish my friend had was ....I don't even know where to start it, from the portion( there we go, this time was thumb size, a little bit bigger, eh) to the taste , it was literally a piece of sadness! She couldn't even cut the meat apart by using the knife, imagine how stiff the beef was! 

And the worst part was my "hard as a rock" dessert, it was this tiny little ugly looking  cake ( or cookie?) which felt  like sitting in a shelf for 3 days ! And the taste? Sweet sweet and hard! 

I feel like I just threw my $50 bucks to the water, I got confused why this place been raked as 4.5 stars, I'll let the pictures tell the truth, I'm gonna go grab my homemade sandwich and call it the night!
