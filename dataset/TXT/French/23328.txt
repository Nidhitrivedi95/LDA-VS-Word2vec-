C6hljmEZYZw4pA0OJaFOjQ One day in Edinburgh and I've had enough "oh... You have a toddler... We have no tables tonight" to last me a lifetime. We stopped here on the way to another "family friendly" restaurant and never left. 
Deceptively large, with a dining room in back, and we were ushered in warmly and given a large table and a high chair, and no evil looks, either. 
Appetizers were the buffalo mozzarella salad and the terrine of rabbit; both were delicious, prompt, and devoured entirely. 
Dinner was a ribeye and garlic haricots verts, and pork belly with an unexpectedly delicious mint pesto. Again, both meals were devoured and thoroughly enjoyed. 
A bottle of reasonably priced Malbec was superb with both, and even went well with sticky toffee pudding and hazelnut semifreddo. 
Note: The toddler ate off our plates for all but the Malbec and had no complaints about the food, service, or ambiance. And he certainly didn't object when one of the two servers smiled at him, called him cute, and gave him a lollipop as we prepared to leave. 
Dear Edinburgh Restaurants: Take a cue from Cafe Marlayne and don't discount customers just because they have little kids. Nobody here batted an eye at seating us, serving us, and giving all three of us a fantastic experience. Cafe Marlayne: We'll be back in a few hours for breakfast.
