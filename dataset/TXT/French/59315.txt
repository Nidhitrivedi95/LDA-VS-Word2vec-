rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w I think it is my new favorite restaurant in Las Vegas!

The service is impeccable. 
It was 3 of us and we got the best emotions and experience after the dinner.
I got the salad - I dont remember the name  (maybe that's why I was refused Elite 13 by Yelp - Im a bad yelper) Thus, this salad is the first one in the menu. 

On the huge white plate there was a small green salad which looked like a roll with avocado, asparagus all some other green stuff inside and it was covered by a thick slice of cucumber. On the other side of the plate there was a lobster tail (perfectly cooked!) and on the third side there was a piece of the meat from crab claw. 
Great combination!
Perfect size!
the ambiance of the restaurant is cozy and chic. Very elegant ceiling covers and 5 stars view on the belagio lake  - Thus, every half an hour you could see the dance of the fountain.
At the end, we received cute little gifts from the restaurant  - So I didnt have to buy a souvenir for my bf. Cute box with 2 candies.
