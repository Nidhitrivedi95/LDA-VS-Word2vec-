It's a beautiful, charming restaurant, especially on a sunny day. Started off with mimosas and then chicken liver pate, the bone marrow salad, and shredded duck confit salad. And red wine - excellent recs from our server. Everything was decadent and delicious. Not a bad plate among all three. My boyfriend looked like he'd died and gone to heaven when they put a huge jar of cornichons in front of him and said we get unlimited bread. I bet they were sorry they told him that after he ate like 3 baskets.

We also had dessert. I highly recommend the orange caramel pudding.

If you want old school French, this is a great bet.
