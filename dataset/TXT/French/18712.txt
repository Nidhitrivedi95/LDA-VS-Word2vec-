AHosGBveeXx9YjsQvdJgeg This is a really nice restaurant and the reason I am giving it two stars is because I expected so much more from such a nice place.

First I'll start with the good:
- Amazing atmosphere and view
- Exceptional Service
- Calamari  & Stuffed shrimp were both very good.
- Temperature of the steak was on point
- The waiter was kind enough to bring out a free dessert for my birthday

Cons:
- items were $4 - $12 more than the prices listed on the menu on their website. 

- Quality of the steaks: My boyfriend ordered the Strip steak and I ate almost a third of it because he filled up eating the app and half my meal because the steak just wasn't great. The sauce was very good but the steak itself was chewy. I have had a lot better steaks places that were significantly lower in price. I would expect a diner to cover a low quality steak with a great sauce hoping someone wouldn't notice NOT when you are paying $38 for the dish. 

- Sides weren't that great: It was like they put all the thought into the sauces but just didn't care about the sides. One dish came with small potatoes that had absolutely no flavor. The mashed potatoes and green beans were the same way.
