rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A A cute brunch spot in the Venetian. It's a little confusing to get to. You have to take the guest elevator up to the guest lobby. We went on a Saturday morning around 11, and waited for about 10 minutes. I loved that they can just text you when your table is ready.  Insider tip: there's a pool with lawn chairs around the corner--great place to relax until your table is ready!

We ordered the chicken and waffles, croque madame, and a side of bacon. The bacon was super crispy and yummy! I was a little underwhelmed with our two entrees though--they were good, but nothing special in my honest opinion. Especially given how expensive they were and the the hype, I was definitely expecting something more. I was also surprised that the chicken was more of a rotisserie chicken than fried chicken.

Why 4 stars? You really can't beat the service there.They accidentally gave our croque madame to another table, so had to remake it for us. To compensate, they offered us cocktails--I opted for a almond chocolate croissant instead. When they brought us our croque madame, they told us that they would also take it off our bill given the mess-up. SWEET! I love free stuff! I thought that was super nice of them, especially given they had already given us a free cocktail and a croissant.

Will I go again next time I'm in vegas? Probably not, but I'm glad I went this time around!
