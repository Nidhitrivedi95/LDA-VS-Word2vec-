rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A My husband and I went here for breakfast during the first day of our honeymoon. We were considering visiting Napa and I really wanted to go to one of Keller's restaurants , so eating here was high on the list for dining in Vegas for me.

I ordered the sourdough waffles and a side of bacon, my husband the breakfast american with a strawberry croissant, one of the daily specials, as his pastry. We both got coffee and his meal came with juice.

The coffee was good but didn't stick out in anyway other than tasting relatively freshly brewed. No burnt coffee, yay! The waffles, served with syrup, vanilla bean butter, and strawberries, were fantastic. It was especially glorious to have all three together on a bite of waffle, the flavors melding together. The effect was a light sort of sweetness that wasn't too heavy or overwhelming. Possibly one of the best breakfasts I've ever had. The bacon was...bacon. And there was a lot of it. It was actually bordering on too much bacon.

I got a bite of the husbands croissant, which was also incredibly delicious. It had a think layer of strawberry jam and was topped with a crumb topping and served warm. The fresh, tart flavor of the jam kept the pastry from being overwhelming rich. It was really tasty and I wish we had brought some home. Husbands eggs were over easy, cooked perfectly, and he said the flavors in his sausage were very good too.

Would have gone back a few more times were it not so damned far from our hotel.
