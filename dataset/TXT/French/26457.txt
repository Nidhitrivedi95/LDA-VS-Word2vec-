D7CnTsm8SCmbQghz1ioPdw As a New Yorker we have eaten in some of the finest restaurants in the city. We were looking forward to a three star experience. We had a lovely server but I was disappointed in the food. The chef tries too hard to be different and looses subtlety of food taste. Everything is with a heavy hand. I ordered the halibut but it was dry. The flavor of the fish was overpowered by the peppers and the artichoke was so overdone that all the taste was lost. We arrived at 7:30 and the restaurant was quiet enough for conversation but then it became full and I couldn't even have a conversation and asked for the bill. Too bad disappointed
