The staff was on target, they were efficient. Mostly. 

I give only three stars because if you have a food allergy, namely a nut allergy - be forewarned. We were promised not a peanut would be in one dish that we ordered. We were in love with our meal, after dessert they brought out a platter of pinafores - which in my opinion is never needed. We were delightfully full and the pinafores always tip you over the edge into "stuffed" category. Anyway - although there was supposedly no peanuts in the offending piece of cookie, there could be "trace amounts". 

Needless to say my husbands system was wrecked for about 24 hours. I know the waiter felt bad, but I honestly felt it could have been handled better and not only that but all wait staff should ingredient-knowledgable, INCLUDING what the pastery chef may or may not assemble before dinner hours.
