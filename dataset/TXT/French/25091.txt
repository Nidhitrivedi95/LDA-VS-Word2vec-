This place was just 100% awesome. Super cool decor, and the quality of the food was just top notch. I don't understand why there are people that complained about the table arrangements on Yelp. The tables were situated far enough apart that any non-obese person would be able to get in and out just fine, and it allowed maximum number of tables next to the window for one of the best views in Vegas from the 64th floor. 

Both my wife and I each ordered from a different prix fixe menu, and we would highly recommend it! We found that the wine paring as well as the timing and order of the courses to be just perfect. The portions of each course did not seem very large, but somehow, it really fills you up! We were barely able to walk out after the meal! 

The price may be high, but for what you get, it is definitely worth it. Plus they also offer gift certificates on Restaurant.com to help with the cost.  I've been to other restaurants that costs more with much less to offer.

You won't be disappointed!
