fyJAqmweGm8VXnpU4CWGNw Big fan of French Grocery. The beignets are excellent and a favorite of ours (as well as some out of town guests when they come to visit) along with their french press coffee. Their espresso drinks are also great. 

Service is always friendly and, while the turnaround isn't necessarily the fastest (beignets and coffee are both made to order) I never have a problem because it's such a neat little place to hang out.
