pmrHuQiy25xKB86tbOLBlA Sante is located in downtown Matthews, North Carolina in one of Matthews historic buildings.  The decor inside still shows some of the trademark architectural features from the original construction, such as the tin plate ceiling.  The restaurant itself is incredibly charming.  The walls, done in a distressed Venetian plaster with exposed brick, are covered with artwork from the local painter Sharon Schwenk.  The lighting is dim and the seating comfortable.  Additionally there is a beautiful veranda in the back that is very romantic.  

I would highly recommend this restaurant for anyone looking for a romantic setting.  Sante is the DRIVEBYCRITIC.COM award winner for Most Romantic Restaurant for 2007 and again in 2008.    The food is divine, the setting is very enjoyable and the staff very attentive.  I selected this restaurant as Most Romantic, not just for the overall feel and decor but also because it is very apparent that the owners and staff put their love of fine dining into their efforts to please their clientele.
