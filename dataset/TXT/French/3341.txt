1cGyzWtfOoDiE8V0OR85yA I came here with my dad a few weeks ago. The interior is decorated with a Parisian theme; very cute and cozy. There is very little seating, but we were able to grab a table. You can also see into the kitchen.

I ordered a hot chocolate which was the best part of my breakfast. It was thick and creamy and not sweet at all--pure chocolatey goodness. I also got a Black Forest Crêpe, which was filled with dark chocolate and topped with raspberry preserves. All their sweet crêpes are topped with fresh whipped cream and walnuts as well. The cream really does taste much better. The crêpe was good as well, though very rich.

My dad ordered a spinach and cheese crêpe, which was also good. All savory crêpes come with a salad.

This place was delicious, but a bit on the pricey side. I'll probably only return on special occasions.
