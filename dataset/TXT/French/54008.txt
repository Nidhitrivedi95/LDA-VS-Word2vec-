qr3iie2aA1ddJasU-6N1gQ I celebrated my birthday here for the first time and the view was sooo amazing! I'm originally from N.Y. and it was just a breath of fresh air to see the water again! The service was outstanding, they were extremely accommodating and attentive towards our needs. They even offered a complimentary anti pasto platter of different cheeses and deli meats they kids loved it. The only reason I did not give them 5 stars and I have to be honest, the food was not that great, it lacked flavor and did not taste as fresh as I'd like it to be. If they focused more on the quality of their food I would visit more often.
