HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw We had a pretty good experience at Comme Ca, but we were not so impressed that we would consider coming back.  We started with the charcuterie board and the bone marrow with the oxtail jam.  I was primarily interested in the bone marrow, and was very disappointed that the portion was so small (it was barely enough for two crackers).  I would rather they gave us more bone marrow and less jam, since the bone marrow is supposed to be the centerpiece of the dish.  The charcuterie board was very good, though.  For the main course, my husband and I split the trout, which was only ok.  Our dining companions got the gnocchi and the chicken, both of which were pretty good. 

I thought that service was very good (although the restaurant was pretty empty).  I did notice that the men's bathroom was out of service, which did not leave a good impression, as this was supposed to be a high-end restaurant.
