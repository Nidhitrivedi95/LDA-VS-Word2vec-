4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw We've been here for a decade and finally made it over to Mon Ami Gabi today! We're vegetarian and our server was very helpful with regards to choices. My husband ended up ordering a spinach/mushroom crepe, which the kitchen made for him without any hassle. I had the mushroom quiche. We would say that the food was probably an 8/10, with the desserts both being highlights. The service was wonderful - brisk and friendly, but not overly intrusive. Solid ambiance - darker woods and a lovely sun room that lets in a lot of natural light during lunch.
