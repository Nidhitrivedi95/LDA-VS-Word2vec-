TgjgHz-QRrv60QKYZ-qmMg I've always been a fan of Les 3 Brasseurs, their food is really good, they have great beer as well. I've sat at their rooftop kinda terrace on St.Denis and it's so nice there! It's a good location to enjoy the summer, and the weather! I love how 3 Brasseurs is chill, you could go there for anything basically and it's nice for groups as well. However, I wouldn't suggest their sangria though, it was my mistake to get it, and won't get it again. It was more like a juice rather than a coctail. Definetely go there to try their beers and nothing else as drinks.
