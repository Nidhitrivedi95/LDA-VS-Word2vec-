KZKbv0vLfW2al37QSu5ZwQ This place is so bad I don't want to waste my life thinking about it anymore. So I'm not going to write in all the details. Just know the quality of food was substandard for the price, the portion sizes were laughable, and the service and wait time was as bad as I've seen in any restaurant.  It looks good from the outside but this restaurant does not have its act together.  Find an authentic upscale restaurant to spend your money in in Old Montreal. This one is a rip off.
