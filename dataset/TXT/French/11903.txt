4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I've been here for breakfast before, great experience. Decided to try lunch and won't be going again. First of all, I walked in and stood at the counter for almost 5 minutes before any of the 4 or 5 hostesses even looked up to acknowledge me. That is incredibly rude. 
I ordered the French onion soup expecting amazing flavor  since it's #1 on yelp and it was good, but certainly shouldn't be known as the best in Vegas. I also tried the Cubano sandwich. That was good. Great flavors. I ordered the Macaroni gratin for my daughter. Horrible. How do you mess up mac and cheese? Absolutely no flavor whatsoever. Incredibly bland. With the amount of money being spent there I expect delicious food and great service. Incredibly disappointed with today's experience.
