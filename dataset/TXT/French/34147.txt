hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA Awesome spot!!!! I had a chipotle panini with mushroom (made to perfection) , a cup of cream with turnip with asiago cheese, totally loved this soup, and a fresh made watermelon/lemonade. We ordered at the counter but the food runner who btw was super friendly and pleasant! brought our lunches to our table, the weather was awesome so we sat outside.. The food, the servers, the ambience, a total package... A place I highly recommend.
