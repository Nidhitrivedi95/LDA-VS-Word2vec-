aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw Always a favorite! The macarons are probably the best I've had (and i've tried a lot of them in the US - from NYC, to LA, to DC, to Baltimore). It was the right amount of chewiness, and crunch in the shell. The flavors are amazing, but not too overly saccharine. The pistachio and the salted caramel are my favorites. 
I also got a chocolate croissant...OMG, it was AMAZING! The croissant was super buttery and flaky. It also had dark chocolate as the filling so it wasn't overly sweet. It was basically perfection!
