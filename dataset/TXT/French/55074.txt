rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A With a doubt, the best meal to have at Bouchon is brunch.

The first time I came here was for dinner. The restaurant was cold, noisy, and impersonal, and the food, while meticulously prepared, simply left me wanting. Upon leaving, I was resigned never again to return.

But friends and acquaintances kept saying, "But you must try brunch! You MUST try brunch! It's the best!" And you know what? They were absolutely right.

What was a cold, noisy, impersonal restaurant during the evening became a warm, still noisy, but welcoming restaurant during the day. It was classy and refined, as a place of this ilk should be, but not fussy and pretentious -- just the way brunch should be.

Chicken and Waffles ($25): This is the Jeffersons dish -- soulful comfort food that has moved on up to a deluxe apartment in the sky. Perfectly roasted chicken with crispy bacon and chive waffles, served with Tahitian vanilla bean butter and a sauce chasseur. My LA friends will balk, but Roscoe's chicken and waffles ain't got nuthin' on this dish. Roscoe's is good grub, to be sure, but Bouchon's iteration is sheer gourmet and absolutely delicious. The chicken was moist and flavorful, and the waffles were probably the BEST waffles I have ever eaten.

Oeufs du Jour ($26): Scrambled eggs with wild shrimp, sauteed spinach, Cajun hollandaise sauce and brioche toast. This dish had a ton of personality and flavor. One bite and you are instantly transported to the French Quarter in New Orleans. The eggs were light and fluffy and the shrimp were buttery and sweet. And the savory hollandaise sauce had a nice kick of heat.

So for those who had a less than stellar experience at Bouchon, I will repeat the advice that I was given: You must try the brunch. For it really is the best.
