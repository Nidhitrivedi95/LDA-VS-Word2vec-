MZ4EEf4VtkeSJURIGgp2AQ Cozy and small little restaurant on main street Markham came here twice for dinner on the weekends. The service isnt bad, usual and standard. 

The first time my pasta was a bit on the bland side but the shrimp was large and cooked well. It was also a friend's birthday and the gave us complimentary cake which was very nice. 

I got the grilled pork chop the 2nd time, the serving was large and the meat was really tender and soft. I was pleasantly surprised! It came with sauteed greens and mashed potatoes which were great as well. For dessert I tried the lemon daqouise, which they said was house made, unfortunately it was very chewy on some parts and very hard other parts. 

Overall, its not a bad place especially there isn't any other great bistros around in the area and prepare for very low lighting.
