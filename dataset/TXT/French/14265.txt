58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw My wife and I went to La Caret when we visited Montreal for our anniversary last weekend.

I'm seriously thinking about driving 6 hours back there this weekend just for more breakfast. It's that good.

I was a little nervous about the communal seating - I'm a big dude and not always the most social fellow, so I thought I'd find being packed in next to total strangers to be very uncomfortable. It turned out to be fine. I think the fact that the people on either side of us were speaking French and we were speaking English helped it feel less weird. Plus, I had more room at this communal table than I usually have on the train or even in some restaurants where the "individual" tables are like six inches apart.

The food was just fantastic. Seriously amazing. 

You know how when you're a kid if you say you love something someone says "If you love it so much, why don't you marry it?" Well I would marry this breakfast skillet, that's how much I love it. Which if the Republicans in my country are to be believed, will be legal about ten minutes after we recognize same sex marriage.
