in3zjiaLpNzr9G3K35gAJQ I use to have a friend name Vincent  , black and white guy wrote all the sports articles for Wildcat uofa paper . Good roommate , Good friend and overall great Eskimo brother but the name Vincent no longer will bring his once cornrows self up , now I will recall the delicious 4 course meal that blew my taste buds into another world, whenever the name Vincent is mentioned. 1. The lobster pancake A+, lobster soup A+++, the Veal  A++++ and homemade ice cream will for ever ruin any store brand.  Nice quite place, you can talk relax , they brought out great birthday dessert so double the dessert love.  Man what a great meal . Now for two people this will run you s little over 100 (without the tip and trust me you will tip great services) but if you are looking for this place then you are looking for fine dining.  It is 100% worth it, special birthday , special anything pleas do yourself a service and dine here . Also get the lobster pasta dish and write a review so i can try it next time but once again that veal was so good medium rare , o my yas yas
