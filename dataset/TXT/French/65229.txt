u-SvRRAfYgpbXZRfQgcTzA I'd been to Imadake a few times shortly after they had opened (yes back when they were called Godzilla's) and thought that the restaurant was good but nothing special. I had dinner there with some friend on Sunday evening and I was very pleasantly surprised. Imadake has really come into its own. Apparently I'm not the only one that thinks this as the place was packed on a Sunday evening. Based on the crowd you would have thought that it was Friday night. The atmosphere was fun and lively the service was good and not overbearing and the food was terrific. As I'm writing this I'm wondering why I'm giving Imadake 4 and not 5 stars, but it feels like the right rating.  

The menu and the food has matured since I first ate there. There are many great options on the menu, the food is fresh and tasty and the presentation is good. 

Many of the reviews compare Imadake to Kazu. I guess this is a natural thing to do as they are both Japanese restaurants in the same part of town at similar price points. However, I think that this is a bit of an apples to oranges comparison as these are two very distinct restaurants with there own approach to Japanese cuisine and each offer a very different experience. They are certainly not interchangeable. Now that I've thought about Kazu (a definitive 5 star restaurant) I know why I was comfortable with a 4 star rating for Imadake. 

Imadake is a great restaurant where you'll have a fun time and enjoy some great (and reasonably priced) food.  Enjoy an evening with some friend and be sure to order the Saki Bomb.
