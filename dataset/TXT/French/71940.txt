XI3iNUgChOfJk5ppjKVEQQ OMG each dish was better than the next. We started with the waiter asking us our possible choices and allowed us to try three wines. We then had the oysters. One was a special with fois gras. OMG. The charcuterie was duck and I literally licked my finger to get what was left on the plate. Dinner. I had the Cornish hen the meat was outstanding the sauce to die for. My husband had the duck. The duck is a different bird than Long Island duck. A bit meaty but absolutely delicious and cooked to perfection with an orange chip that was unique and flavorful. We were offered the mushrooms as a side and they were phenomenal. He explained a traditional drink to cleanse the palette before dessert. It was an apple brandy that not too sweet and a perfect transition into our chocolate creme fresh salted chocolate incredible dessert. This was one of our top meals. The waiter was amazing. He deserves accolades. The music was so odd but it fit so well from Stevie Nicks to Chuck Berry. I have nothing to say but Wow. We will be coming back!  Thank you for a wonderful night!
