rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I had such high expectations before I came here for dinner. I was a little disappointed. I ordered the lamb and my husband ordered the halibut. Food was fresh but flavors were bland. No extra kick.  I could get better food for half the price at many other restaurants.  I will still try Ad Hoc and French Laundry because of all the hype. I have not given up on Thomas Keller just yet.
