YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g Wow what a disappointment... We stooped in for some lunch and my wife ordered the meatball sandwich and I grabbed a burger and her mother had the chicken entree, first off the burger was dry and i didn't enjoy anything about it, very over priced for mediocre food to say the least, my wife's meatball sandwich was spicy and that wasn't ever in the description, my mother in laws chicken was dry and the bed of whatever it was severed on was just weird, bad food for outrageous prices.
I didn't care for our server either, she was very snooty...
