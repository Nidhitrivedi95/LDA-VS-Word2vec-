rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw French Toast heaven..imagine a largest brioche single cut of bread ever..pre-soaked in egg mixture (hours or night before) then fried by pan until every side is super crispy and fluffy.  Served with vanilla mascarpone, orgeat syrup, and almond brittle.  Everything else was good...French toast was the best..by my judgement...but judge for yourself!
