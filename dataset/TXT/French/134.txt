-4TMQnQJW1yd6NqGRDvAeA Went here for the first time last night and it was awesome :) we were seated outside which is so cute and quaint. Cannot wait to come back when the weather starts to cool down. My husband ordered the filet which he loved! I wasn't as hungry so I ordered the Mac and cheese and it was really good as well. The drinks were really good also..I got the gimlet and it was delicious. This restaurant has such a great feel and the staff was so friendly. Great overall experience and perfect date night :)
