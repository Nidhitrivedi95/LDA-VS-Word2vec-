COgwFthJpS4We16W5Gf4lw Our go-to spot for any kind of celebration- birthday, anniversary, Date night, etc. the servers are knowledgable, their wine menu is impressive, and the food is perfection. The crudite basket is a welcome way to start your meal, and if you are into escargot- this is absolutely the place to get it. The duck is fabulous, and if you can make it through your meal with room for dessert, the chocolate mousse and creme brûlée are to die for. Treat yourself! 

The parking is a little confusing, as the restaurant is in a residential area. Make sure you read the signs carefully so you don't park in someone's driveway!
