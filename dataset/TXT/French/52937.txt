QeFsIMcIFIJcOrpthYL8jg We had found this restaurant online prior to our trip to Montreal and wanted to visit.  So, we stopped by in the afternoon to make a reservation.  We were given a very nice table by a window (great for people watching in the Old City) and within eye- and ear-shot of the music.  Both my husband and I had trout almondine.  Before we ordered we were advised by the server that it wasn't white trout, but a salmon trout - which we really enjoyed.  Veggies were very nice as was the wine.  Normally we don't linger over coffee and dessert but the ambiance and music were so nice that we ordered coffee/cappucino and a yummy chocolate dessert.  Service was also excellent. Both the maitre d' and server were friendly, cordial, and bilingual.  I would recommend and return on a future trip.
