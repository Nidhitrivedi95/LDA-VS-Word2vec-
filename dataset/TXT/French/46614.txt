nkHaix6KenApS8M-liZsCQ Went for reataurant week and left in utter disappointment!! Do they not get it:  this week is for showcasing and trying to entice people to return?

First and foremost, the service was oblivious and downright terrible.  It was amazing, a total lack of any semblance of service by a number of staff.  Our server was terrible, just seemed to try rushing us to be done and was exasperated when we asked for the simplest things; We saw one server reach down to pick up a napkin while holding someones food.


Onto the food:  boring, unispired and not very good!  Example:  the foie gras was served with 2 small crostini and a sprig of lettuce.  Nothing more.  Usually, a gelee or compote is present to soften the flavors.  The french onion soup was terrible...awful tasting broth, bad tasting onions and unmelted cheese.  The fish was small and tasteless.  Dessert was weak, but at least edible.

For the price paid, this was shameful.  No chnace any of us will return.
