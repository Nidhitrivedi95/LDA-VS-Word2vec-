That being said, if you like a real hamburger cooked rare, good luck finding a better one in South Park, if not south Charlotte.  Service gripes notwithstanding, we do always seem to have fun here, and it seems most of the other tables are having fun too.  That counts for a lot!  Agree with other reviews noting both peaks and valleys on the menu ... Hard to say this place really nails it, and yet it is unique (for the area) and we just keep coming back.
