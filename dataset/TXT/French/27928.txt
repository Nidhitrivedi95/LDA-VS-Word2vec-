dW9cPsvOGwlOpiz3wEBgiQ We love this place and always made the trip out to LLV because dogs were welcome on the patio and the food is great. However we made the trip out there on our day off this week and waited outside for 15 minutes only to learn that due to the health department, dogs are no longer permitted. As if Lake Las vegas needed yet another reason to lose business out there, we are sad but no longer have a need to visit this restaurant.
