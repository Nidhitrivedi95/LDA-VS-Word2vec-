sARavfidmIS878q5BtlyVQ In a city full of superficial glitz, outposts of celebrity chefs, and NYC copycats, é is something truly special. 

The Spanish are doing some crazy stuff with food and ingredients that sound like you're going to make a bomb but end up as things like spherical cocktails, foams, and semi-substances. And it actually tastes delicious!  Some of my favorites were the truffle cotton candy, salt baked foie, chickpea stew, and "styrofoam" apple tart. 

I cannot recommend it enough if you have a trip to Vegas and you are an "advanced eater."  Leave the buffets to the amateurs. 

On a side note, I was shocked at how easily my group of 3 (that turned into 1- Vegas strikes again haha) got a reservation the week of our trip. Definitely worth a try if you decide to go last minute.
