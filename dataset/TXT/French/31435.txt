gISrxk4A5dfrjDivkC-L-Q This bakery cafe definitely gets an ooh la la! Simply the best croissants in the city. So what if they're not made locally? They're made in France with French flour and butter. You can't get better than that! Baked fresh every day, so delicious! Their coffee is excellent  and their hot chocolate Angelina is to die for. Also tried their Parisian sandwich made with a real demi-baguette, ham, and brie; simple and good.
Inside the cafe you feel transported to France because of the decor and because the staff speaks French. So many goodies to try! I will have to come back. Merci!!
