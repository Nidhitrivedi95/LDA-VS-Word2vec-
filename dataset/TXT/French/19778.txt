aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw This review is based on the kouign mann...I came here for croissant and i stumbled upon the display of Kouign amann!! OMGOMG!! I bought 4! It was like honey and  crispy on the outside and super flaky on the inside. I think it's rare to stumble upo Kouign amann, for it's not widely made in most bakeries. The macaroon didnt look too pleasant.
