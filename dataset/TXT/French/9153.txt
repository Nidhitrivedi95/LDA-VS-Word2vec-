4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw This place is such an awesome dinner option on the strip. Really delicious French bistro food at a great price. View of the Bellagio fountain show from the patio, although they only accept reservations inside, if you get the right table you can still see the show.

But the real show is the food. Steak frites, fresh fish, oysters on the half shell, delicious soups and a really great wine list with variety and affordable options. Love this place.
