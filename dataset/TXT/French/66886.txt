We had heard the buzz about this place.   Something about blah blah blah local and blah blah blah wine bar.   It blended in with so much of what we'd heard of so many other places in town.   It wasn't catching our attention.

Then, while we were walking by on Queen Street.. we were gestured to come inside by a patron in the window.    We listened.

Sure,  we knew it was a wine bar.     Sure,  we knew it was going to have a well-curated list.   But what we didn't know was that the food quality was going to be so creatively stellar.  

Outstandingly flavored dishes.   Perfectly prepared.  Perfectly sized.     

Top notch, well-timed service.  

An absolutely wonderful place that captures the unique high-end, but approachable character of this great part of town. 

One of the best spots in Leslieville.
