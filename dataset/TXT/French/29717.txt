fFInb4Dl2Ix4iE-VOltbkQ Walking by, the energy was good so we went in.  The food and service were top notch and we were pleasantly surprised to find good CA wine on the list. I was initially disappointed that the mushroom ravioli only had 3 in the serving, but I would have filled up on that because I could not have stopped myself.  While certainly not cheap, I certainly felt that this was money well spent.  A very nice evening...
