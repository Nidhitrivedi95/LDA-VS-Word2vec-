ME6D5nLlfG0xZCtICOYDuw BEST MUSSELS I'VE HAD IN CHARLOTTE!  Hands down...AND they can be prepared in at least 6 or 7 ways (maybe more, not sure).  Wine selection is thorough and very pair-able with raw items or entrees.  I ordered the trout and it was delicious, but after splitting an order of the mussels and a salad with my husband as starters, it didn't compare!  Seriously folks, go for the mussels!  After dinner cappuccino reminded me of France... The atmosphere was lively and fun.
