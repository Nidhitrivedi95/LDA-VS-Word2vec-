m4PW-GMc8JOU5nmMYncu-Q Had a fabulous time here with my girlfriends. Just a relaxing but yet fun as hell atmosphere.  The 12 page menu is no joke. There are tons of cocktails to try and there's something for everyone.  Watching the bartenders mix the drinks was a show in itself.  Everything they make is top notch and delicious. They are also friendly and are awesome at concocting something off the menu. The bartenders also performed a juggling act with bottles of fire and they also spitted fire out of their mouths. It's was not overly cheesy either. Highly recommended if you're in Montreal for a girl's night out. Drinks to try: Vanilla and Raspberry Collins, Harry Goose, West Indies Colada and Haute Societe.
