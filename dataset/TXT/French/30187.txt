FRuuIDOd21pTJHvEGIt1Gg Very brisk for Christmas lunch. I strongly recommend reservations. It is very humourous that they would turn us away when the place was empty when we walked in (see picture). But clearly a popular place and by the time we left every table in the place was full. 

Without a reservation in busy Christmas lunch season I would recommend a reservation for anything more than 2 people. We sat at the bar.

Expensive lunch:
$10 soup
Lunch special $19 soup and pasta

Food was ok.... one of my colleagues had to send the lunch special back and the meat was raw. To their their credit they did check shortly after the first bite and were quick to bring a new plate out.

I have great respect for restaurants that have staff that can recognize a problem quickly. I think this was reflected in the tip.
