3FlWR_osNPb8dcqLgHebHw I do like the food here.  The take out Thanksgiving dinner was good.  Some of the customer service is great.   This time the waitress never came back to check on me,  offer more coffee or to see if I wanted my check.  Another time I was by the hostess stand for over 10 minutes.  Even though 5 employees looked  at me no one offered to seat me, or get help.  I give up!
