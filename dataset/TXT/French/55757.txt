rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I thought I wouldn't be able to get in for breakfast since there are no reservations, but I am an early bird and was able to get in early enough before the crowds and made it for brunch on Saturday and breakfast on Monday. They are two different menus so I will review both. For brunch we ordered one of the signature dishes chicken and waffle.  The chicken is not breaded nor fried, but nonetheless was unbelievable. The chicken was moist and full of flavor and was served alongside a gravy which was also excellent. I tasted the gravy, but it was wasted on me the chicken was so flavorful I didn't think it is as necessary. The waffles were very light and airy and made of sourdough bacons and chives served along side vanilla bean butter and syrup. It's a winning dish and a must have. Other dishes which were also great:

-Omelette with cherry tomatoes, mozzarella, sausage 
-Omelette with ham and cheddar cheese
-Bread pudding with pineapples and toasted marshmallows

All were excellent. I thought the bread pudding brioche was a take on French toast but it was more like a bread pudding dessert. 

Try and sit outside in the courtyard which has a beautiful fountain and views of the spectacular garden and pool.
