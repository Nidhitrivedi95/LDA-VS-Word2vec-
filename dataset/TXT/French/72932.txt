XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q We went to Joel Robuchon to celebrate our wedding, I had been looking forward to this dinner for a long time and it exceeded my expectations. First off let me say that this is not just a meal, it is an event. We were picked up from our hotel by the MGM's complimentary limo service and taken though The Mansions at MGM Grand (where the high rollers stay). We were greeted by the hostess and escorted through the mansions to the restaurant where we were seated at a booth in the corner. (I highly reccomend trying to book one of these as oposed to their smaller tables)

My husband and I both ordered the 6 course menu which included an apetizer, soup, 2 main courses, a cheese course and dessert. As if this were not enough also included with all of the menu's is the amuse bouche, bread cart and the dessert cart. My husband had also called ahead and told them about our wedding and that I had also celbrated my birthday the week before so they gave us a celebration cake as well.

Each course got better and better with the exception of one of my main dishes and my husbands dessert choice. This was not because the quality wasn't superb but because the flavor was not something we enjoyed. My favorite dish of the night were the veal cheeks, you must order this! My least favorite was the roasted lobster which was served over rice with sea urchin and asian flavors.. it just didn't appeal to me.

I would also highly reccomend getting the cheese course if you can afford it and enjoy cheese, we both tried a few different kinds that we had never had before and loved each one.

Overall this was the best dining experience I have ever had even though at times the service can be a bit snooty and over the top but so is the food! I would reccomend this restaurant to anyone who loves food and can afford to pull out all the stops for one night.
