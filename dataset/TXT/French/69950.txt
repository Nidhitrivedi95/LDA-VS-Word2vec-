I had dinner here a few hours ago and only 3 tables were occupied which meant great service, not having to wait for each dish for a long time and getting a chance to talk to the Le Cordon Bleu chefs/ instructors/ students who run the show.

They offer a 3-course lunch for $15 and a 3-course dinner for $19 - a very good deal.  For my appetizer I got the beef carpaccio with field greens, parmesan and truffle oil - it was amazing...my favorite part of the evening.  Then, I had the New York steak Diane with potatoes, fried onions and carrots - the steak tasted like Filipino barbecue but with a nice semi-spicy kick at the end.  For dessert, I had the apple galette with a spoon-shaped tulle - it wasn't overly sweet which was nice.

The place is nice and you can watch the chefs/ students prepare your food.  It's like watching live Hell's Kitchen without the cursing and yelling.  I was entertained and I wish I was as good as the Le Cordon Bleu chefs or had their kitchen so I can do crazy stuff.

On the way to the restroom are glass windows where you can see students practice different knife cuts.  Dinner and a free show, what more could I ask for?  I'll definitely keep coming back.
