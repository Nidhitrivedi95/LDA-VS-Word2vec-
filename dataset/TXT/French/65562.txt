U1LB3sRMGTu_h7Sf9QdNoA I love the coffee and pastries at this cute cafe and will come back for breakfast one of these days.  But I have one complaint that I have with other restaurants and cafes in Toronto:

IF YOUR WEBSITE SAYS YOU OPEN AT 8 AM THEN BE OPEN AT THAT TIME!  I'm so tired of showing up at a restaurant or cafe only to find it closed when the website says it should be open.  So typically Toronto.  Ugh.
