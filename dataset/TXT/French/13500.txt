4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw OK, first let's dispel the rumor that sitting across the street from the Bellagio fountains indoors or outdoors is a worthwhile experience.  Without the music the fountains are just a bunch of overgrown water sprinklers and, unfortunately, the music cannot be heard.  Even outside, the road noise and crowd noise from the restaurant drowned out the music.  So if you're going to go here, go for the food alone.

Extensive and interesting menu and wine list.  We enjoyed the following:
 Beet and apple salad (complimentary) served with the French bread and butter.  Very good and quite interesting.
 Shrimp cocktail - very good
 Chicken liver pate with toast points, cornichons, olives, and pickled onions - great!
 Flat iron steak bordelaise - Good if you like bordelaise
 Fish and chips - wonderful and possibly our favorite dish
 Garlic Spinach - very good
 Frites - very good - a cross between potato chips and fries.  Must try.
 French onion soup - fair.
 Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes - Excellent - some of the best we've had.
 House Merlot - average

Service was excellent.  Outdoor seating is fun for people watching but is first come first serve only.  Inner patio covered seating is same.  Indoor seating would definitely be my last choice and might not be a choice for us as there was a strong fish smell throughout the indoor areas.  In fact, it even drifted out onto the patio when we were first seated.  Hopefully a one time thing.
