dW9cPsvOGwlOpiz3wEBgiQ We were meeting family for dinner at Lake Las Vegas. We chose this restaurant for the menu. I am glad we did. The three of us enjoyed our meals. The lentil soup was fresh and light. I had the filet Mignon in peppercorn sauce. It was cooked perfectly and was tender. The sauce was delicious. Very light tasting, the right amount of pepper flavor. The vegetables were fresh and full of flavor with light seasoning. The highlight of dinner for me was dessert. I had the NY cheesecake, and it was by far the best NY cheesecake I have ever had. Creamy not crumbly, light not to sweet. A piece of heaven on a plate. I hope to go back to see if I can buy an entire cheesecake.
We all enjoyed ourselves and had a wonderful meal. 

My only wish would be different chairs. They were on the small side and started to get uncomfortable towards the end.
