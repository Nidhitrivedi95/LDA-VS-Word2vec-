mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q Loved the classy ambiance (perfectly bustling in the kitchen and restaurant, beautiful jazz, great lighting), the service (made some great substitutions), the selection, the amuse bouche (little shot of foie with port wine reduction), the meal flow, the whole experience. Great! Recommend.
