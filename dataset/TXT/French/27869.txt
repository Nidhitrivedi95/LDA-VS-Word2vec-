Dw83Qgi-FSYeuD_gJwwycg My boyfriend took me to Kitchen Galerie last week for my birthday. What an incredible dining experience. The atmosphere is very welcoming while still being edgy (our waiter/chef/sommelier was handsome, charming and quirky who had a large mop of unkempt dark brown hair); the rock band The Pixies (circa 1992) was played loudly in the background to our delighted surprise. The wine was incredible. The food, oh the food was divine! We ordered the side of beef which we super-sized with an option of a large piece of foie gras and gosh, we are so glad we did! How happy we are to have dined at Kitchen Galerie. How happy I am to have celebrated my birthday at such a lovely and memorable restaurant. I fell in love with my boyfriend all over again while sipping French wine, nibbling on buttery côté de bœuf and savoring truffled mashed potatoes. We are making plans to come back again soon! Be sure to call ahead for a reservation.
