exz9aZqMqjpqzUOFBAl9Gg I went out with my fiancee and another couple last night to Portovino. I enjoy the food there and the atmosphere is nice. Last night, however, a waitress asked us if we wanted sparkling water or flat. We all said that we wanted flat. 

At the end of the night, we were charged $7 for the water! That wasn't acceptable. I explained to the waitress that we all said we wanted the "regular" water to avoid a charge. She then said that we opted for the flat water. I explained to her that she misled us to believe that was regular tap water. At the end, they removed the charge which was fine. Next time, it's best to be clear and not mislead a client when asked for water.
