36pB0QVVNZuOLV_UxosbAQ Very rustic and simple place, we went to the restaurant location and also à their stand in Atwater market. The food sleek for itself, very simple, good, and well seasoning. The decor of the restaurant is a bit flat, it's a few red pic-nic tables, a flag of  Reunion Island, some pictures and flip-flop hanging on a string, maybe a make over is to think (you can have a island vibe without a shoe hanging behind you). But I think the big mistake is the front, it's dirty, the paint need a bright new layer, and their signs are hand cut vinyl and tape paper. I put 4/5 because the food is great, the service is fast and nice ever at Atwater market but clearly the restaurant who is open all year long need a make over.
