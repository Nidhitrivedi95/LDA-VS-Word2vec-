XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q I'll have to agree with Adrienne for the most part. I know my taste buds aren't as acute as the chefs but when I really think about the dishes, I'm amazed at all the flavor nuances in the dishes. Is this place pricey? Yes. Is the menu nuts? Not really until you start tasting it. Is it worth it? Once in a long while. I would have to say price is a bit absurd only for the reason that you only get a couple dishes. I mean technically the cheapest choice is almost $200 with tip. So the bad thing is you get an an overwhelming selection of bread, an appetizer, entree, then some sweets but the overwhelming selection of sweets come out and they LIMIT you to five choices. It's a little crazy if you ask me. The food is really good but I just can't fathom the pricing and how it does not already include tip. I can pay for food, I get it but at this price I really think your wallet should only come here once in a blue moon. My main gripe is out of the four waiters/waitress who helped us, only one was honestly robotic nice and not pompous. Don't get me wrong, food is good which is why I put three stars, one for each dish I got.
