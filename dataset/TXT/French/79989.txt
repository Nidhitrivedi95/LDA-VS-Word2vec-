ZuYsZvJ5r32Fs70vPXbRgw I bought a $39 for $70 Groupon voucher and called to make a reservation 4 days before it expired. The lovely lady apologetically told me they were all booked but took my number to see what she could do. She called me back the next day and extended the promo by a week!

I went there with a friend and we were both blown away by the service. We ordered a very flavourful lentil salad and a salads du jour to start  (that really was not worth the $12). We were very happy with the mains- duck confit and braised rabbit, their creme brûlée though,  definitely made this meal even more memorable!
