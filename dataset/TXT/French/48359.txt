o9lekFmrfgaj4jSQ0ovCBQ This is a family run restaurant in Laval.  The best parts were that it is a bring your own wine restaurant and the service was good.  Other than that the food was not good and was especially expensive considering the quality of the food.  The portions were good, but the food was not good. The fish of the day was overcooked so that it was very dry and the sauce that went with it was horrible.  Also, they did not get the order right for the sides.  Not a good experience.  Others at the table were equally unimpressed with their meals.  

Also, it took a long time for our meals to come out to the table.

All this for a $50 per person meal.  There are much better options available at any price.
