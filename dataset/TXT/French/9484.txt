4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I'm not going to tell you anything that the other reviews have said.  Mon Ami is great.  We go there every time we're in Vegas and we've never disappointed.  This time we made reservations on Open Table about an hour prior and got seated at a table just inside of the patio with a great view of the fountains.

We ordered brie for an app, we both had steaks for an entree, and chocolate mousse and bread pudding for dessert.  Service was attentive was not overbearing and the food was great.

Great prices for the Strip, too.
