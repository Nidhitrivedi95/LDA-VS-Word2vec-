0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g 5 Stars for the 125 year tawny port alone.  Yeah, that's right! 125-year tawny port!  I was like the most delicious tawny port reduction known to man, and I'm a tawny girl!  Um, excited much, me?  Oh, and it's about $159 a glass...so come prepared...

Delish pre-dinner cocktail (apple martini NOT made with that green sour apple crap), delightful champers to start.  Did the prix fixe with wine pairing...with the kobe beef on offer for today. Oh butter yum steak killer melty buttery deliciousness.  Did I mention it was fanfuckingtabulous? 

Service excellent; sommelier was attentive, fun and knowledgable with the wine pairing (and the post-prandial port).

Dessert was meh-very chocolately thing, and the "take away" breakfast pastry paled in comparision to the flaky butter goodness that are the pastries at Bouchon.
