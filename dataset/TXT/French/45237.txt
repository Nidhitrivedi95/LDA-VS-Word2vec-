mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q In Vegas over my birthday, was looking for a special, signature experience, l'Atelier seemed like just the place. It was tough to get a reservation at this 1 Michelin star restaurant, but my M Life connection got us through. I think it's intended to be a 'workshop' of sorts, where the chefs can experiment. With the Michelin star come high expectations (and expensive price tag).  Not sure that the experimentation came through; we tried 5 small plates (la langoustine, la ventrenche, les champignons, l'oeuf de poule, la caille):  all were very good or excellent. We each had a glass of very good red wine (pinot noir and malbec) as well as liquid dessert (in the form of Tokaji). As difficult as it was to get a reservation, the place was half full. Spent $250, really don't feel like we got value for money. Maybe we were jet lagged, or maybe it's just that expectations outpaced reality.
