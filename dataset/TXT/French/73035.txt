XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q If you would like a quick 2 to 3 hour meal, this is the place! After a long day of drinking, my girlfriend and I wanted something quick and inexpensive to soak up the liquor.  That led us to stumble into this this quaint French shack. We weren't expecting much due to the low price and simple interior, but we were wrong! This was a hidden gem in the heart of the strip. The food, while simple, was outstanding! I recommend this place to the whole family!
