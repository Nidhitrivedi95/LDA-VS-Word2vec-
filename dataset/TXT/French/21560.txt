bEVWHtBRYVwqaaNF4mWNYg Bonjour Mesdames et Messieurs !!

Ended up in here for lunch today.
I'm not an expert on french cuisine but this place was very appealing. 
I'm also not sure about other french restaurants in the GTA but anyways here we go ... 

I believe is more of the 'fine dining' venues to go. 
I had a Chicken Crepe which has mushrooms, spinach, brie, and a cream sauce.  Came with a side of salad greens and it was DELISH!
It really filled me (maybe a little too much with all the cheese lol).
That came to about $14 I believe.

My boss ended up with one of the sandwiches which also came with a side of  salad greens.  The sandwich was also grilled on a smaller baguette and that was eaten in 5 minutes :P 

At night I read that they have Jazz... I think that is only on Sat nights. 

I would definetely come and check this place for dinner. 
They always has specials on mussels after 5 pm which is also a weakness of mine :)

Bonne Appetite !!
