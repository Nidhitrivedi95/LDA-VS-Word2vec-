hzyvL2v97xLzLbLXcdi1uw Cute shop in Lawrenceville. My fiancee and I were looking for a tasty quick brunch before we went off to the grocery store (never shop on an empty stomach!)... and Yelp shows us the way! It is a small cafe on the first floor of the building but offers plenty of seating! We didn't have to wait since we were okay with sitting at the bar next to the kitchen. It was fun watching (read: learning) how they make their crepes and french toast! We ordered a vanilla latte and a cappuccino which arrived hot and delicious! We sipped on these as we waited for our food, which wasn't long. I ordered the French Toast with strawberries and a side of two eggs and my fiancee the Spinach Tomato Mozzarella crepe (you know, for the sweet and salty approach we always take!). Both were perfect! My fiancee almost forgot we were splitting and finished 90% of the crepe... so thankfully I still tried it. Fluffy, delicious, flavorful! The french toast bread was amazing and the coating was cooked perfectly! Yum! Can't wait to go back!
