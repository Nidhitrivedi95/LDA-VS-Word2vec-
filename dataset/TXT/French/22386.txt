Everything on their menu looked fantastic, as did their specials. We shared an order of the drunken bread which was bomb. I had the chicken ranch blt sandwich with fries, others at my table had the special salad, cobb salad, and french dip. Everyone seemed to enjoy their meals, myself included. My sandwich came with a ton of fries, I may dare to say maybe too much? But everything tasted great. One of my coworkers mentioned it was my birthday and they brought out a plate of vanilla ricotta with whipped cream which was a nice surprise. I'll definitely return.
