P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ let me say, i've been to better restaurants.  We ordered the 7course menu of Travelzoo voucher, it costed $400,not include drink and tax. The service isgood but the food only worth $100/person at all.
the place is quiet, people well dressed, but didn't like the decor much. Lots of plain walls. NO art work or anything.  I felt like i was eating in an empty room, with a couple of fake plants in the corner.
i would rather you spend your money across the street at Joelle Robuchon.  Spend your money somewhere else. i hate to be tough on businesses, but i was disspointed after spending over 500 dollars.  don't know, but i was expecting something else.  NO wow factor.
