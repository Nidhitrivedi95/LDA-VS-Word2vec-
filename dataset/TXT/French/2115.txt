0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g Without a doubt, one of the best dinning experiences I've had!
Starting with the table located in the terrace, just overlooking the whole majestic Bellagio fountains and the strip. Peaceful (rare for a Vegas restaurant)and with a 'private' fountain show every half an hour.
The dinner was perfect in every detail: From the spot-on service to the 4 course dinning menu. You CAN'T miss the Foie Gras and the Roasted Pigeon! They are spectacular, perfect in every way! The Spanish Chef Julian Serrano clearly knows what he is doing.. in every single detail, like the vanilla twig with the Foie Gras... Genius, Ole!

The wine listing is impressive with a variety of wines from all over the world, but I really appreciated the Riojas. This days American restaurants carry much more Californian wines, and it is not easy to find descent Spanish wines every were. That said, be prepared to spend a pretty penny on the wine, and the whole meal to be honest... however, it's worth it... every single penny of it!

This is a very high end, upscale restaurant, and they take the dinning experience to a whole new level taking care of every single detail, including a pretty departing gift as you leave the place. As I said before the service is very friendly and courteous, not a pretentious ambiance at all, something that I personally really appreciate!

Picasso is a delicious experience, from the moment you cross the door and enter the restaurant, you will feel immersed in an exquisite experience! Do NOT miss it!
