xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g Most amazing night we've ever had! We came here for our anniversary/ his 21st birthday and it was spectacular!! The food was fantastic he was practically drooling over his plate. The view was unbelievable! Since he told them it was our anniversary, they set out a dozen beautiful red roses out on the table  everyone was so nice and helpful, everywhere you turned someone was there to assist you with anything your heart desires  truly amazing! I even got to bring the roses home with me to remember the amazing night! The hostess also came up and took a picture of us to remember the night
