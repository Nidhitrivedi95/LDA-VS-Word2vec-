It came with toasts and dried fruit and a sherry reduction that tasted like Christmas.  Yum!  I had the lobster bisque and should have stopped there because I was so full, but I was so pleased with the food so far I wanted to try more.  I ordered the crab cake salad with the house lemon vinaigrette.  Can I put this dressing on top of a cake?  The food was delicious, the staff was very attentive but not annoying, and overall, we were quite pleased.  I recommend this for a date night or dinner with friends.
