0JGMKaKJGVuDus5WcJzvjw Seriously, I think Liverpool house is worth than before , about service and food , overall . The waitress is rude , ( with not serving plats and a poker face ,showing her attitude while when we tasting the wine ,  typically looks like 'Chinese ppl will not tip you, Chinese ppl doesn't have money to drink a bottle wine ' ) , well , I declare I tip every time and always 15 or plus in general , but I really don't want to tip her after her service ( even though I still tipped , after a 400 plus bill I think 10% is away enough for her ) anyway , no reason to eat at a such expensive resto for a low level of feeling .
