xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g I was surprised at how good the food was for what sounds like a theme-type restaurant. It is actually a great place to eat with no kitsch. When you take the elevator, the doors open to the kitchen which was a fun surprise. 

Fabulous food, wonderful service. The portions are not huge, but a lot of the food is rich. I thought it was perfect, but I could have eaten more it was so good. 

Men: DO dress with at least a button down shirt and slacks or dark jeans with no rips... I saw the host loaning a button down shirt to a guest who came in a t-shirt... I am assuming they were not going to let him in wearing a t-shirt.
