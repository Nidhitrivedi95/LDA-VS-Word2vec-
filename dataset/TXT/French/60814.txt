SCklYa_jhihWAcfIn-_chg I've been to Bonjour Brioche a couple of times and every time's been a delight even if we had to wait in line or sit in the heated patio during colder days.

What brings my bf and I there for weekend brunch is their spicy bacon sandwich - it is AMAZING. I tend to scope out the daily menu to see if it's there. 

The service has always been friendly even though they're always super busy.

Sitting in the patio in the winter is fine, it's heated and they even offer blankets.

Would be a solid 5, but sadly the spicy bacon sandwich isn't a permanent item.
