AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw Great little spot for breakfast. Came here with my partner while we were staying at Caesar's Palace for the weekend. I had a delicious, fluffy waffle covered in bananas and Nutella, and he had French toast that looked pretty good, too. I will say, though, that the espresso/cappuccino left quite a bit to be desired.
