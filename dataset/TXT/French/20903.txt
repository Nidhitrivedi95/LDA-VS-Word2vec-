AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw The DEFINITIVE macaron.  It has basically put all other macaron shops to shame.  Payard's recipe is perfectly delicate with a light crunchy outer shell and the moist smooth melt in your mouth center.  My favorite flavor is coffee, and pro-tip, you can call the night before and order specific flavors instead of having just the assorted flavor pack available for sale.  This is my must-stop treat for every trip to Vegas.
