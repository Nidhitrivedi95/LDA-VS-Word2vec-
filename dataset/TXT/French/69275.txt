You won't find baguettes or croissants here, but that's ok because we need a place like in our lives. To show us what fine French pastry and dessert is all about! The quality of these goods is second to none, and you are getting the real deal. It's not a large bakery, and there is no indoor seating. There is some outdoor seating for when the weather allows. The interior feels fancy, but not gaudy. You walk in, peruse and take out. The bakery is visible in the back, so you can observe the chefs in action. They have a large selection of macarons, a variety of flavors.  The pastries are toward the front, with appropriate signage to tell you what they're made with and their price. This is so helpful because by looking at them you would definitely not know what kind of dessert they are- they're almost too beautiful to eat! Everything I have tried here was delicious, nothing has disappointed including the macarons. Crispy on the outside, soft, chewy and melty on the inside. From the entrance to the packaging, the entire experience is excellent. This is the kind of store you see on 5th Ave. in New York City. It's pricey but worth the indulgence when you can.
