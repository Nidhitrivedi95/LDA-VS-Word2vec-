OmFXBWLv1DoFelP2-RLqFA Arrived without a reservation on a busy Sat night so had to sit at the bar upstairs.  But no worries cause the service and the food was great.  Had fresh oysters to start then shared the duck, lamb and puff pastry.  All uniquely flavored and tasty.  Portions are small for the price but with a half liter of wine, we spent $100 with tip.  Not cheap but great atmosphere.
