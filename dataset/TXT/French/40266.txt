KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA A beautiful Lake view place to visit. I came beer in a Sunday morning. I did not expect to sit outside but the moist and fan make it surprisely not hot at all. 
We ordered the French toast and chicken waffle. The chicken was really tender and tasty. The waffle and French toast did not give us too much surprise.
The service was attentive and nice. I believe it will be very nice to come back visit during the spring or fall.
