cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg Finally got to eat here after foolishly trying to get reservations a week before my visit a few years back. Making a reservation was very easy... three weeks notice worked for me this time. 

Very, very good, but not the flawless (or near flawless) experience I was hoping for. 

There seemed to be some communication issues between front of house and the kitchen... they were out of a lot of desserts, but we only found out after we ordered and the server took the order. There were too many specials, at least a dozen, I love specials, but I draw the line somewhere around 5. I felt sorry for my poor server! 

House brew is great and a decent price. 

The pates and meat platters are to die for. The maki special was excellent too, if a little strange for a French place. 

Love, love, love the atmosphere and the staff is wonderful, if a little scatterbrained and overwhelmingly busy.
