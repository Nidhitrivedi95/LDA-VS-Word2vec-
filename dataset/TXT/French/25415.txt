Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA Food was good but not outrageously great for the price you pay.  We got the 4 course menu with wine pairing and it definitely filled us up but the experience was horrible. As soon as we walked in we came across a snotty hostess thinking that we couldn't afford the place and from there the workers were horrible. Service matters even if the food is great. Our experience here after spending 500 dollars was horrible. I had excellent service at craft steak at MGM and better food. Our waiter was great at MGM making jokes with us and talking with us. Mix, you guys have to step up your service even though the food is great. Don't get me wrong, the ambience is awesome but the service put our experience down. If your young, I don't think you'll get great service. But why should that matter!?!?!?
