rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w Le Cirque is amazing. The food is incredible. The service is impeccable. The atmosphere is unique. We dine at Le Cirque each time we go to Vegas. It is a fine dining restaurant worth spending the extra money on. Also, they don't take themselves too seriously. They are not at all stuffy. We always enjoy our time there.
