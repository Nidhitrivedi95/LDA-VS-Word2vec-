3jKUbhGSjFTv5jZ0wnW0xA Really liked this place.

Food is great, service is great, really cute place. I came here at 8pm on a Saturday night and it was pretty empty. We had a great table. 

Apps: I had some escargots, which were really tender and came in a good melted butter sauce to dip bread in. 
Main: Salmon tartare. Wow, portion was bigger than expected. The tartare was good, and so were the piping hot and sweet fried yam sticks (bigger and wider than the regular yam fries) that came with it.
Dessert: Good desserts. As expected from a French place. We had the 4 piece dessert (I forget what it's actually called), but it's the dessert where you can try mini-sized versions of 4 desserts at once. Yummmmmmm
Drinks: Had a bottle of rose wine. Standard rose wine which wasn't too sweet; nothing special imo.

I was happy from beginning to end with the ambience, service and the food!!!
