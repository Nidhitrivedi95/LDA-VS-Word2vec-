4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw My meal at Mon Ami Gabi can be summed up in one word : TENDER.

Tender is a strange word on its own, but when combined with other words like filet and mignon it is perfection.

A group of 6 of us arrived to the Mon Ami Gabi restaurant on a Friday night (with a reservation, which I highly recommend), and waited about 15 minutes to get a table.  They have a huge outdoor seating area, but we requested to sit indoors because it was in the triple digits outside.  We were sat in the area adjacent to the patio, which ironically was really chilly and a number of people around us felt the same way.  Beware the breezy area betwixt the outside HEAT and the a/c CHILL from inside.

Anyhow, the food was AMAZING.  HIghlights were the fromage appetizer with a blend of yummy cheeses, and the amazement that was the Filet Mignon with Merlot butter sauce.  

If you get the server known as 'Georgie,' you'll be in for a treat.  She was absolutely lovely, and took the time to explain many things to us, from drinks to entrees.  She was awesome.

Overall, an awesome experience.. and I'll say it again.. the Filet Mignon was perfect, juicy and tender.  And I do love me tender..
