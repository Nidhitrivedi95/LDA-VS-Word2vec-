rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw I am very selective about my 5-Star ratings and am exceptionally happy to add one more to this short list.

I went to Bardot while staying at the Aria hotel/resort.  I honestly didn't think much of the typical fancy places in Vegas, which is maybe why Bardot was such a revelation.  Most of the fancy places are all decor and no real substance.  Bardot was the rare exception.  If I go back to Vegas, I'll be sure to dine there every night.

Bardot has your typical French decor: Beautiful tiled floor, lots of brass at the bar, and elegant seating.  

Along with that decor comes a great bar and great bartenders.  These folks are genuinely happy to see you.  The customer service here is second to none.  Bartenders are experienced and knowledgable on all beers and spirits.  I tried a few beers before deciding that Hors D'age was going to be the one.  I highly recommend it, especially considering that you can only get it at Mina restaurants (or so I was told).

The food?  Delicious!  If you go for brunch, challenge yourself to finish the french toast.  It's like nothing you've ever had before.  Close to half a loaf, this delicious piece of heaven comes with a fantastic almond syrup thing that enhances the experience.

You've read enough of my rattling, go and try it.  You will not be disappointed.
