2. excellent service
3. Menu variety

This place is a diamond in rough. It's got class and appeals to a variety of appetites, tucked away in the heart of downtown Tempe (party central), yet it's got a private feel or rural-ness. It's a little expensive, however, I've been known to turn the other cheek with price/value issues, when bribed with good hospitality, a memorable experience, and good coffee :)

The fire place is a nice touch.
