I came with my family of four and had a reservation at 9:45 pm. They first serve you bread and you choose: white, wheat or baguette. They serve you one bread at a time but if you want more, just ask! I got the "Roasted rack of lamb, tomato tart, tarragon jus." It was my first time trying lamb and it was really good! I also got the "Classic potato gratin." That was also good but I was so full that I couldn't finish it. I mean, who doesn't love cheesy potatoes?! Our server Christy was SUPER helpful and nice! We were going to order a soufflé but, it was already late and they stopped making it. Maybe, next time? 
At first, I was expecting to leave still hungry but I was actually pretty full!  I would definitely recommend this place whether it's a special occasion or not.
