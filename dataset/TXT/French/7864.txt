4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw My favorite spot to have breakfast in Las Vegas. The coffee and menu is absolutely fantastic. The toast and jam is also a must. Get a spot on the patio, it is worth it.  Was just in Vegas for 3 days and had breakfast here twice. It has become somewhat of a tradition when we are in Vegas. Highly recommend.
