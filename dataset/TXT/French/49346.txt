or4UVDjXEEjze3wNPjoAZA just had dinner at the zinc bistro and the food was good, but the 
management really needs to be improved.  This was a place where
i have had numerous good lunches so I knew what was expected.
We had our appetizers and drinks without any problems, then the long wait
for the entrees occurred with the waiter repeated apologizing and saying the
food will be arriving in a moment due to being very busy, but after over an hour these excuses was wearing thin.  No manager in sight
and it appears many other patrons were experiencing similar delays.
Most upscale restaurants would have a manager offering free drinks
desserts or something to make up for the delay .
When we left we mentioned to the. hostess our disappointment all she
can do is smile and say sorry and many of the other diners also complained
but she has no power to do anything.  "Have a nice day" attitude 
does not deserve another chance.
