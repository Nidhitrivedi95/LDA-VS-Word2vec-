0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g Exquisite venue that not only has an upfront, showcase view of the Bellagio fountains, but also has lots of Picasso paintings to admire within. 

From start to finish, you know you're in for an exquisite experience. Picasso has its own escalator bank that leads you away from all the crowds inside the Bellagio, and as you're greeted, you'll walk through their wine display cases. Inside, there's a large, airy room with large, comfy booths and tables that provide enough privacy for groups large and small. And the artwork on the walls are subtly highlighted; while they're not the focal point of the establishment as if you were in a museum, they still provide an elegant backdrop to a lovely dinner. There's even a binder full of backgrounds behind each painting that you can ask to peruse. 

Service is formal and professional, with just enough attention to make sure your needs are met, without being too intrusive. And, of course, the food was the main event. An amuse-bouche pleasingly paired a sampling cream of potato soup with a pheasant croquette, while the next course, Alaskan king crab, helped whet the appetite further. The sauteed "A" steak of foie gras was sinfully delightful, while a decent helping of filet mignon was prepared perfectly to order - medium well, in my case. A dessert duo provided a nice ending to a meal that was beautiful both inside and out.

Definitely worth every penny if you're up for a splurge. Also, definitely worthy of 5 Yelp stars, not to mention two Michelin stars the last time such ratings were given for Vegas. And a perfect venue for my 800th review!
