XcWlBj5oQgzKhR7Cxovj3w Pre flight burger and beer stop. 

I am a regular burger snob at the Kierland Scottsdale location, so I know how their burger is usually properly served (only before 5pm).

What is it about a bar that isn't wiped clean from previous guests??? Can't use the "in the weeds" excuse this time (and most of the time). The place is mellow and not jamming.

Asked for the burger medium (some pink), and it was well (no pink). Fries luke warm. Did not ask for the manager as this is a rare time when I didn't want to stir the pot.

Basics: Clean bar. Greeting. Food cooked to order, expo the food from the window quickly.
