0d6kx6Jlocw77y1J9nbqMA There are a lot of reviews already, so I'll keep this short.

1) staff - not friendly, had to ask for coffee refills. Coffee was fine.

2) food - 5 of us were there - 1 had a cold omelet which had to be redone. I tried the quiche lorraine, it wasn't too bad actually. Friend had the spinach and goat cheese quiche - all I could taste was the goat cheese.  Crepes with ham and cheese--- where was the bechamel sauce? And where was the cheese? literally large (approx 1 in) cubes of ham, and a small amount of melted cheese on the crepe itself. And there was one.  All of them came with a side salad (think mixed salad from costco) with a tiny tiny amount of salad dressing.

3)decor - ikea meets misc magazine covers/shoots.

Not great. I've had better.
