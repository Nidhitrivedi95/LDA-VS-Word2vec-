SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ Since I moved to the Valley in August I have been on a journey to find the greatest locations with nice, quiet, laid-back atmospheres and House of Tricks quickly became one of my favorites. As a singer, I need places that are quiet and chill to go get a drink so naturally I quickly latched onto House of Tricks as a favorite for an evening drink. The bar itself is a very unique treat: outdoors in the round with trees built-in as part of the bar rather than torn down! When dining, a majority of the seating appears to be outdoors (which is fine because it has a fantastic patio) but I have sat inside and it is a wonderfully intimate atmosphere; built out of what appears to be a very old house-turned-restaurant. Very cool! I had a fantastic glass of wine and a Scottish Salmon that was served to perfection. Bravi to the staff of House of Tricks for creating a truly unique establishment that is sure to create regulars out of wanderers!


Keep singing,
