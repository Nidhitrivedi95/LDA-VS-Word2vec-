hvjgF-vnPw2jyL5DBuB0qg Incredible food and service! We opted for the chef's tasting menu and recommend this if you want to try several menu items. For $60 pp we received a platter of 15 oysters and smoked salmon, 5 appetizers, and 4 entrees split amongst 5 people. Portion sizes were generous! We took leftovers home to enjoy the next day! Will definitely come back here the next time we're in Montreal!
