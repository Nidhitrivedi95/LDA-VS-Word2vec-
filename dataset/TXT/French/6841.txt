4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw My boyfriend had never tried escargot, so you bet I took him here! 

Inside is very romantic and quiet, but we wanted to sit outside to people-watch and enjoy the chilly weather. From our table, we had a beautiful view of the Bellagio fountains and the craziness on the street-- we loved it. 

Escargot- amazing and my kind-of picky boyfriend loved it! (You have no idea how much that meant to me because he kept saying he'd hate it--I always win!) 

For our main dish we had Steak Frites, which was amazing-- obvi! It was seasoned to perfection and the fries were perfect and crispy.

Great experience!
