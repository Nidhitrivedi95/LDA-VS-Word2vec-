nk9lP-iXi7xklwN3VYf6Ew Came here for lunch and we were gravely disappointed w/ the food. The lunch menu was nothing special and overpriced. I ordered a chicken club sandwich because nothing else on the menu sounded appetizing and I honestly thought I couldn't go wrong with such a classic lunch staple. Wrong. The chicken was overcooked and the tomato jam tasted disgusting. I mean, it was edible I guess but for $20, it was so underwhelming and overpriced. My friend ordered a salad with smoked shrimp and didn't end up eating the shrimp because it was too smokey. Service was mediocre- waitress never came by to refill our glasses. Not coming back.
