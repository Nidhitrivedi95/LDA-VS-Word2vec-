YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g Fantastic! Ate there for a late dinner probably 9:45pm and the staff was still friendly and very attentive, even after a long day. Cocktails were yummy we had the cherry limeade and the blood orange with nitrogen. Loved the small plate style, ordered 6 as recommended for two people and was completely satisfied. My faves were the chimichurri skirt steak and they creamy polenta. I thought everything was perfect from the decor down to the silverware. Great Job!! I would recommend this restaurant over and over!
