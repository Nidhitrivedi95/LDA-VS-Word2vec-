SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ Fantastic menu options made this an evening to look forward to. Made reservations only to be told,"they were not a guarantee of a table." when I arrived. . Not sure why they asked me what occasion we were celebrating when I made the reservation?  No VIP amenities or accommodations. Waited 35 minutes to be seated. Duck was undercooked and poorly seasoned. Bison meatloaf was dry. Cornish hen was over seasoned and drowned in sauce. Best meal was a filet that was cooked perfectly. This is what earns them 2 stars. Service and our table location were inadequate.  Disappointing place to celebrate a special event. Too many great eateries around to waste time on this establishment.
