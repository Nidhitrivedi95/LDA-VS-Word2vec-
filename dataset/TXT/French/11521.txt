4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Been to this restaurant several times because of the  view.   This time 
arrived at 8pm and told there was a 2 hour  wait.  After waiting an hour , saw they were sitting people who arrived later with no reservations.  The hostess and manager were very disrespectful and condenscending. Decided to go elsewhere after 90 minutes. 2 other parties that were from other countries were also waiting over 2 hours also and were treated rudely. 

Maybe they play favorites with their friends.  I will not go there again.
