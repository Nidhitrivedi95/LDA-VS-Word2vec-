cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg We made the reservation two weeks ago. Probably because it's weekday, we are the only customers at 5:00pm.
We didn't drink alcohol, only a bottle of water. The water is in glass bottle, taste better than thesame brand in plastic bottle.
Tarragon Bison Tongue is the first dish. The tongue is from beef. Mr. Tang said it's good. I prefer the pickle, since I didn't try the tongue.
Catch of the day, we picked the smoked eel. It also served with a piece of veal bone, you can eat the marrow(not sure if it's this word...).
Fg poutine is great, although foie gras is too greasy for me.
The duck in a can is great too. The duck is juicy and fresh, also with blood. The veggie taste a bit sour, really savory.
The one missing star is for the dessert. Both icecream and pecan pie are too sweet for me to enjoy.
