fRu_POqPowUo6nHSRMjOPw Took my sister her for lunch for her birthday during TIFF. We walked in, asked for a menu, and decided to stay. As the waitress walked us to the table, I almost fell over, the floor had heaved, and the waitress didn't warn us. After I commented on how dangerous it was, she said, yeah, we should watch our step. 
Sat down, ordered a glass of wine. I asked the waitress if the calamari was a lunch sized dish, and she told me it came on a salad and was great. 
So I ordered it. There was only about three tables, but it took quite a while for our food to arrive. When it got there, there was one little piece of squid on a couple of thin slices of tomato, tiny squares of cucumber and a few strands of endive. For $17, I was not thrilled. My sisters food was good, cold, but tasty. Waitress was inattentive, and quite frankly, in a restaurant in a hotel the caliber of the Germain, I expected much more. Lunch was over $85, and I felt ripped off.
