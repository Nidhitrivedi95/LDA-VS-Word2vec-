pmoIMK8zGWvKsVOPDBYfzg Don't go as a group earlier than 7:30.  We arrived at 6:45 as a group of three, and it was awkwardly hushed and romantic.  However, if that's the scene you're looking for, it was lovely.  I think that maybe it's better for couples than groups.  The decor and styling can't be faulted.  We had two foodies and one non-foodie/food-fearful person in our group.  Andre's was a great way to introduce him to fine French food.  The courses were nicely paced.  Normally, we only order one course at a time, to prevent the kitchen from turning dishes out too quickly.  Our server at Andre's politely asked if we could order all courses at the start of the meal to help the kitchen prep, and then just inform him when we would like them fired.  The iPad wine list was interesting, but not working great when we used it.  However, it really broke up the wines nicely to help with the selection process.  Our apps included Cesar salad (don't judge...), escargot, and fois two ways.  Treatment of the fois was very nice, though I found the fruit compote a bit too cloyingly sweet and would have liked a bit more acid to liven up the richness of the seared fois.  The escargots were very nice.  Entrees included the hoisin duck, venison rack, and lobster thermidor.  My husband loved the lobster, but again, I thought it was just rich without a lot of complexity.  He voiciferously disagrees.  Our non-foodie friend was really impressed with the hoisin duck.  We all split the nutella souffle for dessert, and I loved that it wasn't too sweet.

Overall, I was very impressed with the quality of the meal.  It was elegant and very professionally served.  I would absolutely go back.  If I were to go as a group, I would probably make a later reservation.  I think I would also be very likely to sit at the bar right outside so that I could people-watch while enjoying the full menu.
