9iy6scMRbs5ue41XRLGEkw I needed a restaurant for a 3 year anniversary dinner.  I was referred to Coup des Tartes and was not disappointed. The atmosphere was exactly what I needed.  Something quiet, intimate  and romantic.  The food was exquisite and worth the drive from Prescott.  I grew up in  a French restaurant and my father is a classically trained French chef so I have had the luxury of being exposed to lots of different foods.  I also have been to France numerous times and it felt like I was there again.  The service was excellent, attentive but non intrusive.  We never felt rushed and had a wonderful evening.  Eating here is an experience to be enjoyed and savored, which is what fine dining is all about.  I found the experience to be a refreshing alternative to the fast food mentality.  I definitely will be back and plan to bring my father here as I am sure it will remind him of his childhood home in France.
