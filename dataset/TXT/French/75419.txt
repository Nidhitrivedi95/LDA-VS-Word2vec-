Ycp3Agr7dt71TZkeKV7jng Used to come to le gourmand a lot due to work is close by . What I like about  this cafe is the variety and they cook everything all day long . So the popular items are super fresh . I had a fresh from oven cookies before and was in tears that I found the best chocolate chip you could think of .  Deep toffee caramel flavor and gooey chocoLate chunk in the center . Loaded with chocolate pieces it's true indulgence. Their pastries are French flair very attractive to the eyes ,nicely layout on the wooden board . For the few pastries I have tried are not bad .  The other pastry in the show case was brought some well known pastry shops . 

My favorite sandwiches are roasted vegetables and pancetta with arugula . It's panni style so it's crispy and the cheese melt with all the flavors come together. 

The worst I have tried so far is the vegetable quiche ,  looking very pretty . It's more like a Spanish omelette rather than quiche , the phyllo pastry definitely give it an interesting look in the edge but the whole thing is under seasoning and over cooked also you can't detect the goat cheese at all. Was disappointed . Thats why it's better to stick with what you like in the restaurant !!!!!
