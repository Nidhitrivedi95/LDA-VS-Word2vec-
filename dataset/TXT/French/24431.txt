cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg I don't know enough superlatives for this place. You have to be a callous bastard of course because this place is all about foie Gras in every conceivable shape or form. I do feel moderately sorry for the various animals it comes from but a) they are not treated the way the activists would have you believe and b) after one mouthful , you really don't care. I can't begin to describe the whole menu except to say that between the foie gras dishes and the poutine , it was better than sex! Martin Picard is a true genius. A one off in every way plus he's a really nice guy and really knows his wine. If you're ever in Montreal,  DON'T  miss this opportunity for truly great and groundbreaking food. Take a fat wallet with you but it's really worth every penny. Great atmosphere, friendly wait staff, what more could you want. Cholesterol factor is out of sight so don't forget your lipitor. I don't know how I'm going to travel back to Syracuse tomorrow. I can't move my stomach around !!!,
