True Reminiscence of a French Brassiere.Bustly and Energetic

The Service was Amazing, knowledgeable and not pushy at all considering they have some VERY high end wines and spirits.

Wasn't very hungry so ordered oysters and the duck breast. Oysters were the freshest Ive ever had in Las Vegas! 

Can't wait to come back and try to there new bistronmy prefix menu!
