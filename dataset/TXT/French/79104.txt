ZdaZwXC0FByDY3EwNELphw My friends and I arrived at Union a few days after it opened. The place was empty. Nice, we would get a table. Or so we thought. Talking to the host, who was quite friendly, he explained they were totally booked for the night. And for much of the week. This place just opened. What? We decided to come back in two weeks.

And so last night we went back. The same host seated us, explained the kitchen was still trying to sort out some kinks, took our drink orders, and left us to enjoy the ambiance of the place. Union is a nice looking restaurant. It feels like a really nice bistro. It's been under construction for something like a million years. For whatever reasons I don't quite know, it's also one of the most hyped up places ever, apparently. 

The wine list is short, and the prices are quite reasonable. There are a few beers on tap. The dinner menu is also fairly short, and features a selection of dishes made with locally sourced ingredients. When we were there elk was featured, as was pork belly. Rhubarb was in both mains. I imagine this will change from week to week if not day to day. Everything on the menu sounded pretty good. Prices weren't astronomical, also a plus.

I'm glad to say the reputation it's earned in such a short time is well deserved. The food was great. The service was particularly good. The place was packed by the time we left, always a good sign.

The restaurant is new, and it's clear there are some kinks they need to work out. Getting the food out to the tables seemed a bit slow. Other than that, I have no real complaints. (I also don't really mind waiting a bit for good food.) 

This place is well worth checking out.
