Dcj69NZJnbJhK-YHP_nULA In town for work. Could not wait to get back here as it has always been a favorite when in Madison.  Drove across town out of the way of my hotel to go there.  Busy night here but not bad. Walked in and asked the hostess for a table for one for dinner. With no smile or apparent need for customers her short reply was there are no tables but you can eat in the bar. No further assistance. I then sat down at the bar along the wall across from the main bar. There I sat for 15 minutes. The bar tenders could plainly see me sitting there.  I was facing the main bar which was about 5 feet away. No acknowledgement at all. The next two couples that came in were given menus by the hostess. 

After 15 minutes and no further human contact I put on my coat and walked out.  Incredible.  I don't recall ever walking out of a restaurant in my life for lack of contact.  Utterly disappointing.  Actually bad service may have been better than no service.  There was no shortage of people working tonight. Just poorly trained with respect to customer service.  So many missed opportunities to treat a returning client as if they mattered. 

Not sure if I will ever return. At least the waitress at Noodles and Company was attentive and pleasant.  I would give 0 stars but that isn't possible.
