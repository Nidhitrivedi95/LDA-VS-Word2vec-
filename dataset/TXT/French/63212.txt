SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA We had an early dinner and were sat at a little table right next to the fireplace. Anthony started with the potato soup, which was quite comforting. I thoroughly enjoyed the duck confit while he chose the  veal spare ribs. Following our entrees we shared a Meyer lemon tart and some impressive espresso. We were also served complimentary glasses of champagne since we were celebrating! The service, along with the aesthetically pleasing environment, rounded out our experience. It was lovely.
