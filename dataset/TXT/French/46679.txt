nkHaix6KenApS8M-liZsCQ Unfortunately I did not get a chance as an out of town guest to even try the food.  Was greeted at door by a bald gentleman who I found out later was the supposed manager or duty and who treated us horribly.  He was very condescending, rude and went out of his way to make me and my friends feel unwanted in this establishment.  It saddens me that he is the manager and took money from his employees pockets as we left and found a better place that was more than happy to serve us.  If you don't like your job sir find a new one.  You should easily loose your job for the way you made me and my friends and even other patrons that came in behind us feel.
