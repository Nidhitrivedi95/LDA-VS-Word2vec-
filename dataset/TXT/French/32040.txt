gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA We made reservations for my friend's Bachelorette event & they gave us extra special treatment. The view of the strip was spectacular. We arrived when the sun was going down so we saw the strip during the day & the evening & both views were wonderful.

The service was more than incredible. We felt like rich people being serviced. It was an incredible experience! They provided us with sample food & we ordered an appetizer before our main course. It was plenty of food, all of it more than gourmet. It was exceptional.

The whole experience was just amazing & I highly recommend this place again & again.
