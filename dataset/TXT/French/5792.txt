3M7MWfMh5RSoASV23-6hEw The three of us, my grandmother, mother and myself were looking for international cuisine, but we found so much more at Mrs. Amigos!!!! This is a small restaurant run by one woman, a kind-hearted lady who barely advertises, just trying to make ends meet. But there is more than what meets the eye, her professional, delicious gourmet French cuisine at a steal! Affordable, amazing and HIGHLY recommended. Patient service, even through a language barrier. The atmosphere is INCREDIBLY friendly. I have absolutely NOTHING even moderately bad to say about this low-key treasure of a diner.
