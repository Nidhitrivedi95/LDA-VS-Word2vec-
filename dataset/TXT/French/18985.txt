The delicate omelet with oyster mushrooms and parmesan is divine, as is the dill-scrambled eggs with smoked salmon. The coffee's alright, but the side salad with a crushed almond dressing is fantastic. 

A wonderful place to go for breakfast or lunch when in the neighborhood. 

Oh and there are the desserts.....
