We ordered: smoked salmon egg benedict and continental breakfast.  Continental breakfast came with coffee and orange juice.  The OJ was the freshest and sweetest orange juice that I have ever had.  I could taste the pulps in the juice.

Smoked salmon egg benedict was a success also.  Pouched eggs just cooked right.  Salmon was not overcooked, and the potato hash were the BEST!  Potato hash didn't taste anything like regular hash brown.  Potato was mixed with flour, but it wasn't heavy at all.  Thumbs up!

In addition, the complimentary pastries were amazing.  Cinnamon bun, cranberry turnover and muffins...

Downside: brunch was relatively pricey.  I would give a 5 star if price is a bit cheaper.  I highly recommend making reservations in restaurants in Vegas to avoid the wait!
