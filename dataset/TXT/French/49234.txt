Or23g875aIDTGNwKQASQgA While prepping to visit this lovely city I came across a NYTimes article about Candide and made a reservation on eve of 34th anniversary. It was a wonderful experience.

We sat near their open kitchen, enjoyed the chefs at work, had a glass of their beer and wine. Then the flavorful dishes unfolded, beautifully crafted, fresh, mostly veggies and herbs. All were described in detail.

If that is an experience you enjoy than make a reservation. If not, don't and leave the seat for those who may. "Tasting menus" are not for everyone but we enjoy them.
