USleI8g1UVN9-9jm-b4uIg Went here with a potential vendor during a business trip to Charlotte recently.  I had heard about the Fig Tree prior but hadn't been.  It is located in an old house so it is very small but well appointed.  We had a party of about 12 - 15 and the waitstaff did a great job.  The service was impeccable.  The food was excellent - i am not sure about some of the other reviews that said the food was just ok.  Everyone in our party was delighted with their dishes.  We had several (read about 6) bottles of wine and drinks.  The wine list is excellent.  I did not pay so i cannot really give a good handle on price but I am pretty sure it was expensive per person.  This is a nice romantic restaurant that would be prefect for special occassion.  I will be back for sure.
