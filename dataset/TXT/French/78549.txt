z6ZPIpO_1Rx69k9y2DQ7Bw First visit....had lunch with Dad...fresh, flavorful, filling.
We both had the Duet Magnifique: half or whole sandwich & 2 sides.  I had: French Onion Soup,  Chicken Parisiene, Salt & Pepper Chips.  Dad had: Caesar Salade, French Dip au Caramelized Onions, Potato Soup.   The half sandwich was cut in half and we could only eat half, which is really 1/4th.  The manager, Melvin, was very hospitable.   We'll definitely be back!
