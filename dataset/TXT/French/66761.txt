UpEVdq_euH-5mqCIgUAd2Q Le Papillon situated on Front Street serves up French cuisine with what I call an infusion of Québécois flavors to suit local tastes.  With a décor resembling to a brasserie, this place is known to serve authentic savory crêpes and comfort classics like French onion soup.  Here's a recap of my recent visit.

I started off dinner with a rillettes de canard ($7.50). It was a duck pâté served with some croustini.  The consistency of this pâté is wonderfully meaty and it was nothing like the spreads you would find from supermarkets.  That's the good thing about a rillette because it's made to have a shredded meat texture, not pasty, so it feels like you're eating meat.  Finally, it's a given that the flavors were very aromatic because of the use of herbs and other spices marinated together.  I could probably snack on this all day!

Then came my main course.  I ordered the feuilleté de fruits de mer ($21.95).  Fruits de mer is a typical term used to refer to an assorted dish of seafood but in this case, it just meant I'll be eating scallops and tiger shrimp cooked in a white wine cream sauce and served with rice and veggies.

Do you ever get one of those times where you eat something and it tastes all right?  I mean there's nothing spectacular to ramble on about but at the same time there's nothing inferior to rant about?  That's exactly how I felt eating this dish, indifferent.  I really would have preferred one extreme or the other.  But this was a boring, safe dish.  Seafood was fresh, sauce was creamy, rice was bland, and stomach was full...but no surprises.
