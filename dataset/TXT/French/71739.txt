xeFVRUjxorxjO_qjX8FNdw I've been coming here since I was a little girl. This restaurant has a special charm to it. It may be the quality of food, the friendly service, or the wide selection of desserts, and it always has me coming back. 

My usual order is the shrimp and dill crepe. The portions are generous and the price is nothing but fair. What I also like as a small bonus is the bread served in the beginning not just with butter, but with olive spread. And given the olive gal that I am, I love every bite of it. 

If you're into cakes and pastries you're in for a treat. The display area with all the desserts will make you want to order everything and this is before you lay eyes on the gelato selection. For dessert I usually order the chocolate pecan tart, and on the rare occasion when available the white chocolate raspberry pie. Mmmmmmm!
