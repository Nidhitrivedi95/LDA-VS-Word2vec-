I had dinner here on a Sunday night.  I was able to get a last minute reservation and was seated inside within five minutes of arriving (it was pretty cold outside).  For the amount of customers there that night, I was impressed by both the service and the quality of the food.   

I came with my mother and we decided to split the beef wellington special-- something I normally wouldn't order, but she really wanted it.  I am so glad that we did order it.  The entree came with a great sauce and a side of garlic spinach.  For two women, the portion size was perfect for sharing.  The dish is very rich and savory so a full piece could be a little much.   The whole thing was melt in your mouth perfect.

We also started with the butter lettuce salad that came with goat cheese, apples and roasted beets.  For sides with our entree we ordered the butternut squash and the green beans.  Upon our waiter's recommendation we had the bannans foster crepe for dessert.  Everything was delicious.

My husband took me to the Eiffel Tower restaurant in the Paris Hotel about a month ago.  Apart from the view (which is amazing up there) I enjoyed my dinner at Mon Ami Gabbi more.  Of course it's a much less formal experience from start to finish and the noise level is higher, but I would give it a better rating--especially when you take the difference in price into account!
