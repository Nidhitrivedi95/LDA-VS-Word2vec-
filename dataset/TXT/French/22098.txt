BS0GcQ1kUag8YJ2qcBH2lQ I would actually give this place a 3.5 stars, but sadly not because of the food - and that usually drives the rating I give the restaurant overall.  Let me also caveat this - I like wine, but I'm not a cheese person.  

Decor:  Loved it!  
You step into the restaurant and it seems pretty small until you they take you out to the back where they have a whole other section with a view of the sky.  I haven't seen many places in Toronto that has this kind of atmostphere.  It's quiet out back and you can sit there when it rains as well (which I got to experience).  

When we arrived, it wasn't raining.  However, 10 minutes later, it started pouring.  Thankfully, I was seated in the areas that they had the tarp overhead.  

Service:  Pretty good.  
Very friendly service and they come by quite often asking if you need anything.  The waiter was not as knowledgeable about the menu as I would like.  (they forgot what were the specials of the day)

Food: Okay
The food was the disappointing part.  I ordered the shrimp bisque and I asked if this was enough for lunch.  The waiter said it was if I got the full size.  Turns out, not true.  Now, unless they thought because of my smaller size I have a small stomach, a watery bowl of shrimp bisque is not going to fill anyone up, especially if it doesn't come with bread.  

We also followed this up with a cheese order (I was still hungry).  We got the pecorino and it well with the grape pairing.  It also tasted like parmesan to me, but once again, I caveat - I'm not a cheese person.  

Overall, if you like cheese and want a restaurant with a good quiet atmosphere, I would recommend this place.
