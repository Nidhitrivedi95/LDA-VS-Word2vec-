P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ Dining at Restaurant Guy Savoy is a very memorable experience.  I suggest you do it at least once.  Would I go again?  Definitely not.  You can get an equally amazing, delicious meal at a less stuffy place for half the price.  

Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the food, ambiance and overall dining experience.  We came for my Mom's birthday.  There were 10 of us in our party, so we had the private room.  We had a special menu designed just for us.  Many of us are vegetarians so they had to customize the menu.  

A few standouts were the risotto, artichoke and black truffle soup with toasted mushroom brioche, bread cart and chocolate cake dessert.  

Service was typical of most French restaurants, a little snooty, but never rude.

Thankful for the experience, doubtful I'll ever return.
