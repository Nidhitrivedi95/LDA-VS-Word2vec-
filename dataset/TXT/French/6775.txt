4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw $20-30 great entrees, French food and delish buttery steaks overlooking the Bellagio Fountains and the Paris themed hotel and people watching, you can't beat that on the Strip. Make sure you make a reservations.

All the steaks with pomme frites (fries) and onions (french style) and beurre blanc / wine sauces are great. Love them. Make sure you get something French style, they cook those the best.

Service is excellent as well.
