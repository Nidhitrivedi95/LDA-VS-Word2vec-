Everything that they brought to the table was delicious, including the steak tartare, octopus salad, and pot au fue. By far, my favorite dish was the shrimp risotto - if you like risotto, I highly recommend ordering this. A nice surprise was that the servings were a good size - my dinner partner and I both felt full after eating only an entree.

Additionally, the environment is very cozy, with wonderfully attentive service, and very fair prices. I can't wait to come back.
