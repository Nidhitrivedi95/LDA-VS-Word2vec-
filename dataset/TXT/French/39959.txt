K64Uw3a2Enh2MznpwRHWKQ four of us did the chef's tasting menu-- a totally spontaneous offerings given some parameters that you convey to your waitress at the git go: no pork, no goat cheese. the restaurant is located in a mall, the ambiance-- how does one explain it-- cozy, semi elegant, lo lit with a long bar on one side. four of  us took a seat at the corner where we could face each other. the four courses i remembered: a beggars purse, a fish, lobster, a chicken in crepe. quite good. i would love to try the regular menu next time.
