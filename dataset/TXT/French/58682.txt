RMHAxJpSwkNC2WIfMokgVQ I have just returned from eating at Chez La Mere Michel.

We walked in and were directed (very politely) to our seat. The restaurant was very quiet (only 2 other tables) at 8. The atmosphere is very cozy, and very stereotypical of a French restaurant.

We were given menus, all full of things we wanted to eat. While we chose our food we were served the best bread we had eaten in a while. It vanished very quickly.

We started with rabbit terrine, and foie gras. Both were excellent, but if I had to chose one it would be the foie gras. It goes amazingly with the aforementioned bread, and comes with a lovely berry jam.

For main courses we chose the duck medallions, and the pheasant. Both were excellent. The pheasant came with mushrooms which were just the right texture, topped with cheese that managed to not quite overpower everything. The duck was pink in the middle but slightly crispy on the edges, and seasoned perfectly.

We decided that we did not need dessert, but the adjacent table had a souffle which looked very appetising.

I think I found my go-to restaurant.
