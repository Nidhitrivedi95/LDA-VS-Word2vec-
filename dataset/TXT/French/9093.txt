4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I enjoyed a private business dinner at Mon Ami Gabi a few weeks ago while in Las Vegas.  We were seated in the semi-private room and my seat faced the Strip and the beautiful fountains of the Bellagio.  I started with a perfectly mixed French Martini and then moved on to my dinner of french onion soup, dijon steak frites, chocolate mousse and the raspberry & shortbread galette - all so amazingly tasty and flavorful!  This is a great spot on the Strip to enjoy a consistently good meal.
