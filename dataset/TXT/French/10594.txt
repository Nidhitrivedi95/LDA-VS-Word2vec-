4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw If it was just for the French Toast, 5 stars. I'm not including Creme Brulee French Toast, or Brioche French Toast.  That stuff is awesome, but I'd put that in another category.  Gabi just has the best straight up French Toast I've ever had.  The inside is nice and eggy, but still relatively light and fluffy, so it's not waterlogged.

The whipped cream is delicious, although, if you're concerned about overdoing it, I'd ask for a lighter serving.

The other dishes are really good, and are worth coming back for, but don't stand out quite as much as the french toast.

Didn't like the coffee.
