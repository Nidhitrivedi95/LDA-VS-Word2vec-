HKrZe0-QGGp3oOYX8cnMSg Wanted to try this resto for a while. Saw it on the event "Montreal a table" so called to make a reservation. The food was not bad. I saw the less good reviews and couldn't really understand why. Maybe I am just lucky. This is the part about restaurant that is difficult to rate, the food quality that are not consistent. Service was so so, little slow at filling our glass of water. The place have very nice decor. Overall I like the experience. Hope it could keep up the good work not just for "Montreal a table"
