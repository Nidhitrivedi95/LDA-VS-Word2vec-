The place looks nice and the ambience is enjoyable. The menu attempts to have a French flair to items with the escargot (eww), rabbit, duck, and poulet (that's chicken in French).  I think this place should be a lounge that serves appetizers and hors d'oeuvres instead of a restaurant with the amounts of cocktails and wine on the menu. 

I ordered the Vogue steak entrée. It came with fries for $22 and got to choose the spicy ollie dipping sauce or whatever its called. Its basically the same sauce you would find in Jack in the Box's chipotle sauce. The meat was tough to chew and resembles that of a low grade cut, and suspiciously shaped like a phallus complete with the shapely head. Nothing like eating some dick for the night is what went through my mind. There was hardly any flavor to the meat and was unseasoned.

I've been to different French owned restaurants in Montreal, Quebec and I certainly would not see this item in their menu or presented in this fashion. For $22, would an 8oz prime rib be much to ask?
