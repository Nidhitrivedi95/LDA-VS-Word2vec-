Da6eZFThE9xanUAGNpZxAg Love it!

I loved it so much that we came twice within three days and that's just because it was closed on Sunday!

The owner and bartender were both great. Super friendly and helpful. The drinks are good and made with care.

They have a great happy hour from 5-7pm daily. It includes half price main dishes. The mussels dish is huge and if you get that for half price ($6.50), you will not be sorry! Get the scallops (only $7 on happy hour!). Don't get the octopus though. It comes stewed in a tomato broth and was too chewy for us. I would suggest changing this to just grilled octopus. The fried artichokes were ok, some of the outer layers were too papery to eat.

We were too full to get the charcuterie plate, maybe next time.

Overall, a great place for drinks and snacks/dinner!
