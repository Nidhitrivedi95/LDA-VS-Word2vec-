Don't get too excited by how the interior looks like: just a decent border between ghetto McGill and le Plateau. Bricks, chalkboards and a pseudo-atmopshere. Oh and an anecdote: the restaurant tries to put in a low lighted, cozy and almost romantic atmosphere at night but somehow needs to have a TV showing Habs getting their butt kicked. 

Food was good, no doubt about that. Most of the sauces match well with the served meats and the portions are generous. I recommend the duck tartare and the French fries. More, if the day of your visit allows you to, get some oysters. However, this not grande cuisine. The sauces are sometimes way too sweet and the oyster sauce almost felt like cheap vinegar. 

Moreover, I experienced quite a cheesy service with a waitress dressed as if she was going to 1234 and who tried to describe her food as a complex and conceptual experience. Big MTL, keep it simple.

Finally comes the bill. Bleh: Old Montreal prices for simply good food and a decent atmosphere?
