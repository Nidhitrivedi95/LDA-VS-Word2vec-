jSfnItqaOnEp2nenVF7fCg Delicious! I enjoyed Croque Monsieur, a black forest ham and guyere cheese sandwich with mornay sauce and salad.  Friends enjoyed the cabernet burger with fries, quiche, and the caprese pannini.  We shared dates/Manchego cheese wrapped in bacon that was amazing!  Do make sure you include dessert!  Pot of Creme (Chocolate Mousse) and Bread Pudding with Blueberries and Carmel Sauce!   We will be coming back often!
