The food was too salty. I got the PDC melting pot- and while the blood sausage and pork belly were good- the dish needed something to cut the fat and salt. The fact that it was served under a salty gravy and over cheesy salty mashed potatoes didn't help. Everything tasted good separately- but together it was too much.

Thankfully my husband's pork chop came with an apple salad/ slaw to help get some of mine down. 

Overall- it was whatever.
