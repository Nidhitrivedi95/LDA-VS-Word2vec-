SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA I visited this restaurant recently.  I arrived in town late with no reservation and the restuarant was crowded.  However, they were willing to work with me and get me in quickly.  Even with the crowd, my order was taken quickly and my food arrived after a short wait.  The food was excellent and I returned the next night for more.  The place seemed as if would be a nice place to take a date but not a place to take children.  I will probably visit the next time I am in Cleveland.
