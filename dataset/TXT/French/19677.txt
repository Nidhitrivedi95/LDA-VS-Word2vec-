aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw I'm such a sucker for baked goods. I blame my horrible sweet tooth for my love of bakeries. Bouchon Bakery is one I've been wanting to try, so I made a point to stop by to see what it's all about. They had a great selection of pastries, cookies, breads, and other delicacies, but not so much that you feel overwhelmed when it's time to walk to the counter to order. Everything looked beautifully made! I literally wanted to try everything. I would have if my stomach had the capacity to do so.

I decided to get a selection of macarons to try. I tried the chocolate, lemon, and coffee. The chocolate was by far my favorite. The macarons were perfectly made. They had a nice crunchy exterior, soft interior, and creamy filling. Imagine a brownie as a cookie with a fudge filling...that's pretty much what the chocolate macarons were like here. Something else that caught my eye were these huge oreo looking things (Thomas Keller's version of the oreo). I ended up trying a mini one at dinner at Bouchon that night, and I wish I had gotten one at the bakery! That thing was crazy. It was seriously an surprisingly delicious, fresh tasting oreo. Despite all the hype, Bouchon Bakery satisfied my expectations. Now I'm tempted to go up to Yountville just for more Bouchon yumminess.
