6Hj4AQ5DDGf7tsVk6LscLQ Live in the area so stopped in for lunch and was pleasantly surprised.  Everything my husband and I had was very good.  My husband had the grilled cheese and I had the duck sandwich. Yes -- prices are a bit high, but serving sizes are generous. 

Lunch sandwiches come with a great salad and potato rosti (like a hash) or daily soup.  We tried both sides and liked them both.

Looking forward to stopping in for dinner soon!
