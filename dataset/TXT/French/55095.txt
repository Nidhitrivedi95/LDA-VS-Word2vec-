rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I often get weird looks when I tell people that I don't like this place. And the only reason I am giving this place three stars is because I love their pecan sticky bun, which is like top two pecan sticky buns I've ever had. It's so good that I drove to the LA location (from OC) to buy more locally, but LA discontinued making them (weird).  

I've had brunch here probably about 7 times and every single time I think I'll feel differently after, but my opinion still remains the same. I usually come with friends who love this spot or want to try a Thomas Keller restaurant. I've had a lot of stuff on their menu, but I'm going to comment on my most recent trip here during 4th of July.

First of all, it was 110 degree weather in Vegas. We arrived slightly before 11am so it wasn't super hot yet and at the recommendation of the hostess, we were seated on the patio outside facing the Venetian pool. Being outside was nice for the first 20 minutes or so, but it got progressively hotter and hotter and hotter. I stopped asking for water and insisted on cups of ice instead. After devouring my pecan sticky bun, I had the Croque Madame, which came with french fries. When I ordered, the server asked if I wanted truffle fries instead and I said sure. What he should've also told me was that it's a $11 supplement! Okay, fine I'm already paying $100 for brunch so it's not a big deal, but the fries were so soft and tasted nothing of truffles. Sigh. My boyfriend ordered the chicken and waffles. The chicken was roasted and nothing special. The waffles were unique but very tasteless without the syrup. This time I'm pretty certain I won't be back unless it's to pick up a sticky bun to go.
