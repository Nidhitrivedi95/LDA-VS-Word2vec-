COgwFthJpS4We16W5Gf4lw We had dinner reservations at another restaurant but because of our poor time management skill we didn't make it so the girlfriend found this marvelous old school French restaurant that has been around since the 50's and still own by the same family.  Keifer, our server, was truly amazing.  He has loads of fascinating stories about the Las Vegas of yesteryear that are delightful to listen to. 
He brought over a Vege basket as the complimentary appetizer and also baguette and a tub of butter.  We loved the vegetable basket...mmmm, delicious and healthy.  
We got a bottle of the Coastline Cabernet at an affordable price to pair with the wonderful main dishes.  
We will truly be coming back because I love supporting family owned restaurants, especially those that have been around a long time
