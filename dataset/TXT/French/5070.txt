37kk0IW6jL7ZlxZF6k2QBg Easily one of the most beautiful and special meals I have ever had, Edulis easily lived up to every positive review I've read. The dishes were carefully crafted, the flavours were simple and yet stunning, and the service was beyond anything I've ever experienced. 

I could go through and list everything I ate (we ordered the seven course menu), but you won't have the same menu when you go. Some of the plates are smaller than others, but there are some larger protein dishes mixed in. Each dish was exceptional. The bread and butter are the things dreams are made of. I kept trying to remind myself not to fill up on bread, but our server refilled our bread after we finished the first basket and it was so warm and crunchy and the butter had these beautiful hints of, like, i dunno, caramel? maybe ... I can't even. 

By far my favourite course was our starting course - something I can only describe as a ceviche salad with limequat. Apparently my spellcheck doesn't think limequat is a word, but wikipedia says otherwise. Anyways, it was magical. 

I would like to especially thank our server, and while I don't know her name, I think if she were to come across my review she may remember us and see this particular shout out. You went out of your way to ensure we were well taken care of, especially my best friend, and I couldn't be more thankful for your hospitality.
