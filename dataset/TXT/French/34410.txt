HO14ySQ5n70Z-XQCFCL1JA I've eaten Winncie's food (take out and in-store) about 10 times total now (my friends love it), and I've given it my best shot.  Unfortunately, I have come to the conclusion that the food here has always been sub-par, and I honestly find it quite terrible.

I suppose the fact that they have very generous portions, good prices, they deliver, and that they have bubble tea (go to BTEA lounge if you want GOOD bubble tea) and both Chinese food and sushi makes it a good option, especially if you're in a group.  However, the quality of the food is just difficult to stomach.  Case in point:  the wonton soup.  It honestly tastes like slightly salted boiled water, with a few bland dumplings, and a scattering of green onions.  The general tao is probably their "best" dish, but I've certainly had better.  The sushi is pretty terrible when you get take-out, but the sushi I've had in the restaurant was edible (however, if you're going for sushi GO TO RAKU IZAKAYA on taschereau!!!).

All I can say is that I gave it my best effort.  I tried, I really did, to like this place and to be objective.  However, you just can't feign liking bad food.  Sorry, Winncie, but your food just doesn't make the cut.
