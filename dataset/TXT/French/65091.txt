TmWz4ZvsNgXj_VMPw6G21w The theme here is 'French twist with the best of Scottish'. From the decor its hard to see where the Scottish influence is. It sent me back to summer holidays in France and the restaurants we'd eat in there. All the staff are French so you can hear them all speaking French to one another so its easy t forget you are in Scotland!

The food here certainly isn't on the cheap end of the scale but the ingredients are of the highest quality and you can tell by the taste. My soup was delicious, and this was followed by cassoulet which once again took me right back to my summer holidays when we ate cassoulet at least 5 times a week!!

Great experience and a good escape to a French bistro in the heart of the French countryside (you'll have to squint a little for the French countryside bit!!)
