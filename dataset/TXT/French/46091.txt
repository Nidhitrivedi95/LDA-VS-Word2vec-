MxHZ5XwIQWnJFTw9gZxAIg The ambience is amazing,cozy couches in beautiful colors,sturdy wooden tables, great lighting, candles everywhere. It's romantic and sexy all in one. PERFECT date spot. 
On to the food .... Haggis balls fried beautifully with the yummiest sauce I was soaking it up with the bread. The ceviche was very good but a lot of work for not a lot of fish .... I wouldn't get it again. For the main course I got the root risotto which was so creamy and just the perfect amount for such a rich dish so so so good. My hubs got the venison served with green beans, and potatoes. The venison deserves a review of its own it was cooked perfectly not to gamey and it just melted in your mouth. It actually was really good with the risotto so we were glad we had ordered both! 
Great wine list as well as scotch! 
Lots around the area for after dinner drinks as we'll! LOVED it and would recommend highly!
