grHISDkIGwttYthhW8DxCQ This place has decent crepe. 
I got the blueberry and banana crepe. It's a healthier alternative to the strawberry Nutella one I wanted to get when I walked by this shop. 
The crepe was light, tasty and perfectly balanced with honey and roasted almond. It was a very satisfying dessert for me. 
The reason I only gave 4 stars is because they use frozen blueberry and I prefer the crepe to be thicker than what they have now. 
However, in general, I would come back for more crepe at this place.
