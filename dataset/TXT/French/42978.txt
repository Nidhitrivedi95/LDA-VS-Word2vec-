LQ_gYNs5E10IGFE0NOyD7A My old roommate, Sarah, and I were super excited to try this place so we brought our boyfriends and went for the full experience; we were ready to spend some money. We didn't make reservations which I suggest doing because they were packed! Luckily they were able to fit us in. 

We started with some drinks, Sarah and I went with the Uptown Girl. We both loved it! The boys had beers. Then to share, we went with the Crispy Confit Duck Wings and Fried Cajun Oysters. They were both very tasty, however, when you split with three other people, you only get like one duck wing and a fried oyster or two. I wish there was a little more to go around!

For the entrees I ordered the Southern Fried Picnic Chicken, which the server told me was a hit and a favorite. He was right. It was SO freakin' good. It was hard to give up a bit for people to try. I highly recommend ordering that. The rest of the table order the Seared Wild Salmon and Miso Vegan Ramen. Everyone seemed to enjoy their dishes but were envious of my order. As for the sides, we got some Hand Cut Fries, Crispy Cauliflower, and Charred Shishitos. All turned out yummy!

I'll be headed back in the future, hopefully to try out their happy hour!
