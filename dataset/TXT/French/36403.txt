I2nw7LGLSHN4uUgnHO5H7A I was surprised to find a Yelp review for Amuse, as the previous review mentions it's just off of Queen St, so unless you know it's there...

And I am definitely glad to be "in the know"......

Have had the pleasure of the food/staff at Amuse at least 4, maybe five times since they opened, never a disappoint except the one time they were full...

Which is a point, if you don't live in the area and are hoping to have dinner here, it might be worth calling ahead, they only have a limited number of seats, but that helps with the atmosphere...
