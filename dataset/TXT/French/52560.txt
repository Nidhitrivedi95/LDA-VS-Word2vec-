Q1XCsLlyXZJU0ZjuVCcM4A Beef bourginon reminded me of airplane food. Unfortunately, on a Saturday night when every good restaurant in these few blocks is booked solid, walking in here to a half empty dining room should be a clear sign. Nice enough staff, just truly tasteless food. My cooked vegetables came with absolutely nothing on them- not a hint of salt pepper oil butter ANYTHING. Definitely instant mashed potatoes as well. Beef broth was too salty and the meat was sparse and fatty. Unacceptable for your signature dish at a French restaurant.
