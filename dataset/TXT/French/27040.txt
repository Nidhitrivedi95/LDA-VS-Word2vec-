Dcj69NZJnbJhK-YHP_nULA came here to enjoy a few drinks before the basketball game.  Was relieved that it wasn't packed and that we could get some good beer and an appetizer.  We order 3 different 4-oz pours of delicious tap beers.  It was fun to try something new and not get a full 8oz.  Also order the Frites.  Delicious!
