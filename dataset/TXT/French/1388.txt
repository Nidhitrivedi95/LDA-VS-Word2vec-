_T7f2wUgNlJqxsR-cR89SQ food: 3.7 - decent in toronto but below par in the international scene of french cuisine
Service: 4.0 - If only my main server could give me a bit more smiles 

An intimate spot tucked away in the old residence of South Hills offering window views of the CN tower cityscape glistening in a distance. 

The gnocchi was a pleasant surprise- airy and lightly toasted, its fluffiness juxtaposed with the crunchy texture of walnuts.  Warm Lobster was accentuated with delicate balance between the refreshing ginger sesame mayonnaise and lobster broth.    Partridge could be slightly less dry and more flavorful. Immaculate service overall from the knowledgeable waiters.  Valet parking upon arrival.
