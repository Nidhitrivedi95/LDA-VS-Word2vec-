The initial free bread basket they give out, comes with this bread.  Tip: before they bring that free bread basket out, ask for ALL CARROT RAISIN BREAD.  Best paired with butter and it is spectacular and super YUMMERS!

As for the rest of the restaurant, all the food is pretty good.  I especially love the Italian selections of Asparagus Ravioli, and Chicken Parmesan.  The Asparagus Ravioli is definitely something different and pretty good!  The Chicken Parmesan is a HUGE dish and the chicken is breaded with an extremely crispy and yummy shell.  

Their menu is pretty extensive with a number of selections to choose from and they have a special menu with special deals for $12.99 that include a soup, entree, a dessert, and an ice tea.  Pretty good huh?

Setting is really nice, a great place to go eat with a friend, or group of your girlfriends.  I haven't brought the boyfriend yet, but plan to do soon!

Go NOW!
