jT-KFrbwr5iE-_vrVLpmiw Line up: none. Ample parking. Car preferable, TTC stop nearby. Choose your meal, dessert and beverage at the counter and food is brought to your table. Located in North York's more commercial area, south east of Sheppard Ave and Hwy 404. 5 stars.

Food: I ordered lamb pita and soup. A cappuccino and a scoop of hazelnut gelato. Pita was excellent with the two dips that accompany it, but the soup was not impressive. My gelato didn't taste like hazelnut, however my cappuccino was excellent. 4 stars.

Ambiance: trendy, modern, airy and spacious. Attention to cleanliness is evident throughout the restaurant including their restrooms. Cafeteria style but don't be fooled, this place is classy and customer service is top notch. The servers were ever so polite, helpful and attentive. 5 stars

Value: good value for money ~ $20-25 for dinner for one. If I wanted to order a wine or beer this place does have a liqueur license. 4 stars. 

Overall: 90%
