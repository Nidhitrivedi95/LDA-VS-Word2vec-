EukD4hlPZXgSMpeya5iX2g We've always wanted to try this place since we live in the neighbourhood. Almonst all the high rises, this restaurant is in a little house along Yonge St. It's a very cozy restaurant with one wait staff and the owner who takes your order. Apparently they've been in business for 27 years. We ordered some apps (mussels, escargot, onion soup and soup of the day), pasta for our mains and skipped dessert. The thought the food was average but my husband enjoyed all his dishes. Would I go again? Maybe.
