4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw One of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas!  Located in the Paris hotel, opt for a seat outside on the balcony.  There will be a wait, especially at night, but it is so worth it.  You will be seated directly across from the Bellagio, so I'm not sure what's better than enjoying amazing food while watching their fountain show. 

On this past long weekend trip to Vegas, I actually ate at Mon Ami Gabi twice in almost as many days.  My girlfriends and I went for dinner on a weeknight, and even for indoor seating had about a 30 minute wait.  But, totally worth it.  This was my first time eating dinner here, and let me tell you--it was delicious!  I opted for one of their Prime Steak Frites--the Au Poivre, which is with brandy peppercorn sauce.  The beef was delicious and tender, and the brandy peppercorn sauce was divine.  The beef had been pounded very long and thin, but man my mouth is watering just thinking of it.  Instead of frites, our waiter informed me I could have mashed potatoes--get the mashed potatoes!  Oh so buttery and delicious. 

I was also impressed with the bread that came with the meals.  They served the bread with shredded carrots marinated in something, and as odd as it sounds, it was absolutely delicious on the bread!  My two girlfriends also enjoyed their meals--one also had a Prime Steak Frites and another had the caramelized sea scallops. 

Two days later, my brother picked me up for breakfast, and this is always his first choice as to where to go on the Strip.  I've been several times prior for breakfast, and have always enjoyed it.   This time, I enjoyed the french toast and instead of blueberries opted for strawberries.  Delicious!  My brother had a ham and cheese crepe--it was good, but he said next time he would get the french toast instead.  

Service is always excellent at Mon Ami Gabi!  I highly recommend you go to this restaurant and enjoy an amazing meal with a great view on the strip!
