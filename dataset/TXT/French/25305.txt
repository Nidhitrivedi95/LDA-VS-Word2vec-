Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA The view here was amazingggg. Located on top of The Hotel by Mandalay Bay, you can see all the lights from below. Make sure you take a trip to the bathroom. On the way walking there, they have a patio where you can walk out and see the huge sign that sparkles and says "THEHotel" it's quite an amazing view with so many lights. The bathroom has a gold tinted window. Great place to take bathroom pictures for girls. 

Food wise, the food was delicious and the staff were friendly. Must try the foie gras steak item on their menu.
