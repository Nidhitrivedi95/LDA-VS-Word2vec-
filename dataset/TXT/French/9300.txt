4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Bonjour! Love eating at this restaurant during breakfast time. ask for Patio seating not to hot not to cold during the autumn season. The thing i love most about this place is the awesome views of the strip and the Bellagio foutains. This restaurant is a great way to wake up to Las Vegas.. I normally have the waffles and coffee while i chat and enjoy the view. A Must do while you are in vegas. The only problem is not that much selctions on the menu. Prices are ok.
