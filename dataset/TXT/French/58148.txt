rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A whoa whoa whoa.... this place is WAY overrated. 

Maybe I didn't get the right stuff, or try the right  stuff. The chocolate croissants looked good. My egg plate was BORING with the exception of the potato mozzarella-stick-looking thing. Juice came in a large shot glass =$3.50 

Service was good but overall the place is eh.
