ucgzkl7atsBMGu4gGpmHfw My son & I went to Peter Pan Bistro for dinner last night.
It is a new restaurant on Queens St. W.
The food was amazing and the service was spectacular!

We started with Crispy Pig's Skin, followed by appetizers Bone Marrow Pizza (my son had a green salad).
For the main course I had Herb Crusted Lamb's Belly and my son had the Gnocchi.
We shared a Rhubarb Tasting and a Pecan Chocolate Tart for dessert.

Everything was cooked and seasoned to perfection.
This was truly a gourmet dinning experience.

To top it off we had all of this for less than $100 (with wine).
I have a new favourite restaurant in Toronto!
