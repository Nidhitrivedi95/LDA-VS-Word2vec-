udFcIcbWbxrO8uLF95WnQg Delicious food and great atmosphere: cozy and romantic without being pretentious. The bread with olive oil and salt is heavenly, I'm always tempted to ask for more but don't want to get too full before the amazing entrees! 

The bar is great for a cocktail before a show at playhouse. 

Only complaint is that I wish they would change the menu more often. They tend to keep their "seasonal" items on the menu for like 9 months...which doesn't really feel seasonal anymore!
