-cheap prices- big ass slice of cake is $4.75 (the size of your face)
-macarons have the perfect texture; some flavs are sweeter than others; loved the chocolate pistachio
-tarts are fresh and not too sweet

NEGATIVES:
-the place smelled kinda weird (not the food) but who the hell cares because you're there to eat, not smell
