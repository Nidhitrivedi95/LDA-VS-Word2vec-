myJ6pgIhN42EQh2sAVXKoQ Completely Scratch my previous review out. I was a nub and my taste buds were still developing.

I went there again and they have Kobe beef which I have never seen anywhere else!


my burger juicy but not greasy, beef was very tender and equally tasty. My friends ordered different burgers and all of them loved it.

Their shakes are pretty good too.

5 Stars for service: I actually didn't order the burger with Kobe beef, i ordered a different burger but asked my server to take out everything made with pork meat, she asked what would i like it substituted with and I didn't have anything in mind, then she suggested that she will upgrade my patty to Kobe beef.

I'll definitely be going back to try their different menu items.
