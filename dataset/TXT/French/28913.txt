el-3IdlW3bTCSnquLvH-3w I'm a sucker for french food and it makes me so sad that we don't have nearly enough french restaurants in Arizona! But, I have to say of the few we have they are all pretty good....and I enjoyed my experience here as well!
A petite cozy place, tucked away, and a perfect place for me and hubby to get away....food is great for the price, and portions are very appropriate!!! 
I hate to comment on service of any resturant because, i don't think that one server's interaction should really summarize the feel of a resturant, and besides i'm not the easiest customer and very particular about food, eating manners, and service timing, so you be the judge....
I will definitely go back, because the food was fantastic!
