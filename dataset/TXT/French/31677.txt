gLuaw6h5WgImHpjseAHVrQ Delicious restaurant, modern trendy decor, friendly service and a lovely back terrace. We started our dinner with the avocado shrimp on pancakes, and noodles with sour cream - both surprisingly decent portion size and delicious. The scallops with miso was a light dish - mushroom purée complimented the seafood perfectly. My dining partner had the octopus with white bean, a very busy dish with flavours which compliment one another nicely. We will be back!
