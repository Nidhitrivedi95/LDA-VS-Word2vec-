O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q This was like my 3rd steak in 3 nights.  

I can't even remember what kind of salad I ordered here.  But do remember ordering the filet.  (It's a nicely prepared 8 oz filet.   But you won't walk out raving about the steak.  It's good but not super exceptional.)
Vanilla creme brulee - Delicious!  I wanted to order another, but my eyes were definitely bigger than my stomach.

I'd go for a different entree, and stay for the dessert!
