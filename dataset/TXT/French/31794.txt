grHISDkIGwttYthhW8DxCQ Thought about giving this place 4 stars but then realized it was only because we had to walk so far from our hotel and had nothing to do with the place or food so revised to 5 stars... 

Delicious crepes! Both of our kids had the strawberry banana Nutella and loved them - even considered ordering a second round.  I had the ham spinach and cheese- delicious! Beautiful crepe, great texture and just the right amount of ham, spinach and cheese inside. My husband had the spinach egg cheese and he loved his as well.

The gentleman behind the counter told us he was the owner's husband.  He made us feel at home.  Refilled all of our drinks and chatted with us about the sights and gave us directions when we were ready to leave.

Small place, very cozy and brightly painted. Made for a perfect breakfast! Reasonably priced.
