mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q The food was 5 stars, but the service was baffling.

First, they had our reservation listed for the mansion instead of l'atelier despite the confirmation email showing the correct restaurant.

Our meal was punctuated by the sound of servers dropping silverware and plates every few minutes. Maybe the top-heavy knives were new? It was such a strange experience to have at such a highly regarded restaurant.

One of the servers dropped the quail entree on my friend. He was very apologetic, but again, it was a very strange thing to occur at such a nice establishment.

Still, it was a wonderful dining experience. The food was incredible and it was one of the best meals I've ever had.
