aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw We woke up late and went to this pool party without eating anything. Too much fun to think of food and then, after five hours under the hot sun, walking on the Strip, my sister literally collapsed on the ground. 
I walked fast (also hungry, couldn't run) to Bouchon and got a nice grilled cheese sandwich and orange juice.
The juice was fresh and I am sure they didn't add any sugar. It was delicious.
The grilled cheese was properly buttered and there must be an extra ingredient because that thing was the bomb - or maybe I thought so because I was starving.
My sister recuperated quickly after drinking the juice :)
