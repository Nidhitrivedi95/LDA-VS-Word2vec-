Everything on the menu looked good, so I decided to go with the braised Quebec lamb shank with yogurt curry sauce, paneer maison, kale & fennel.  The juicy tender meat fell off the bone making me wonder why I was given the Crocodile Dundee inspired steak knife.  The curry, paneer maison, kale & fennel accented the dish quite nicely.
