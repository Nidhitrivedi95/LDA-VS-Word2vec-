50-xiTYmE6NERi-yJ6NvHw I always wanted to go to Biff, and I grabbed onto the opportunity when Summerliscious rolled around. Let me start with the decor: it's cozy but very fancy at the same time. My friends and I tried their $1 oysters - they are so good for the price. From the menu, I tried the Salmon Tartare (appetizer), Beef Steak Diane (entree), Chocolate Bavarois (dessert). My friends tried the appetizers: Chilled Cucumber Soup, St-Canut Jambon de Paris; entree:Poached Salmon, Chicken Au Pistou; and desserts: Un Bordel de Fraises, and Biff's Summerlicious Cheese. 

I really enjoyed all the menu items. The steak was a little more cooked than I wanted for Medium Rare - but it was still delicious. One of my friends chicken was a little under cooked around the bone. For the desserts: I absolutely loved the Un Bordel de Fraises. It was sweet and sour - a wonderful combination. I didn't get that of course, but my own Chocolate Bavarois was still good - not too sweet and texture was perfect. However, I just preferred the Bordel de Fraises more.  Overall this meal was well worth the cost. My next item to try is the Steak Tartare - I've heard many good things from friends. So I'll see you again, Biff!
