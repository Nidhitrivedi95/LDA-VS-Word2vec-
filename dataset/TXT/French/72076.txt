XKPosZx2j4RHcZ8Ewdwj0A Montreal has so many great restaurants and this is near the top of the list.  Trendy, but not snobby, with a great selection of wines and French dishes.  

I had the beef tartare and vegetable tian--delicious!  They are also known for their steaks, short ribs, and french fries.  

The variety of dishes, the wine list, the friendly staff, and the hip decor make this a top notch restaurant.  And if you visit after 10PM, they have a lower priced menu.
