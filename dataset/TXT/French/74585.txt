xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g This restaurant is very upscale. As you take the elevator up to the restaurant, you can't help but feel excited. The elevator doors open up to the kitchen which was different. You'd expect the kitchen to be in the back, but here it was the first main attraction. Very clean and "white" themed. It was definitely the cleanest looking kitchen I've ever seen! The décor is simple and not overly done as it is made to make you feel like you are in the Eiffel Tower overlooking the view. Nothing fancy on the walls since it is fine dining. The booths are very comfortable and seat a part of 4 just perfect. You get the view of the water fountains of Bellagio every 15-20 mins or so. Although I would have loved to see the setting sun from there. The service was a bit off. Our water seemed like he didn't like out of towners (the again, who does?). He was very short with us and had a sarcastic tone. That's fine, but we were expecting a 4 star restaurant service. The meal itself was so-so. I expected it to be perfect as we were supposed to feel like we were in France, but the choices weren't that creative. Probably the best part of the dinner was the Raspberry Soufflé with vanilla sauce. Mmmm. It was a good one time experience. The ambiance screamed out of towners, not really romantic.
