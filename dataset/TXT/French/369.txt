-ClafaRWkSRTfieIzO4r3Q The decor is outstanding.  The bourbon sour tasted like it had a coconut base.  Not very appealing.  The $5.00 at 5 appetizers were okay.  Not great.  The sevice was so inattentive that we decided not to order main courses and went to another restaurant for dinner.  I really was hoping for a better experience.  Roux is kind of expensive too.
