LtDYRcMJbJPhXPEklT29Fw My husband and I decided to go here, spur of the moment, for date night. We were greeted very warmly and seated at a cozy table for two. The space is lovely.  I wish we'd gotten to sit near the fireplace!  Our server was very nice and a little shy.  We ordered the "prohibition" gin drink and an old fashioned. Let me just say, I've had ALOT of old fashioneds and this one was the most perfect one I've ever had!  We settled on the "game" 5-course menu to share. The kitchen kindly split each dish into two and the portions were still adequate. The duck bratwurst was outstanding and only wish it had had more au jus.  The venison was really the star course.  It was perfectly prepared and seasoned well. I would highly recommend this spot for a special occasion or to enjoy happy hour. I should note that the concept of this restaurant was the real draw and I will definitely be back to support it.
