w2tr0PA0b3tg8pId0kjM-A You don't need to be pretentious.  The quality of the  food sells itself.

I would give the quality of the pastries here a solid 4.  I got one of each of the four on display. and a baguette.  Total was $30 which is fine for the quality of the selected items.    I didn't understand that gimmick where the staff spoke French at all.

Overall the pastries are very good. The baguette was also good.  Maybe I am a little to rough and tumble for this place.
