gLuaw6h5WgImHpjseAHVrQ Went there for lunch. The place look great, I love details like the ''W'' on their glasses, it looks very design trendy. The place was not packed at all and we've (group of 4) experienced the slowest service ever. I must say the waitress seemed to be alone there so maybe it was too much. .. So I have picked a plate of pork which was tiny bit like a ''cotelette de porc'' without the bone, it was like a thin steak of pork and I really wanted to love it but myyyy it was fat, it looked like it was all fat no meat. Did not like it at all but the rest of our table ordered the fish and apparently it was exquisite.
The dessert save the day it was so good, different and flavors were so intrestingly mixed. I enjoyed it. The waitress was really nice, overall a good service, I think I would go back and try something different and re-review this place.  They make a great Gaspacho if you like that (im not a fan of cold soup but you know, if you are: it's great).
A little pricey but it's similar to the other restaurants .around
