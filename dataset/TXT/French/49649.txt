or4UVDjXEEjze3wNPjoAZA Zinc Bistro is my go-to restaurant to fulfill my after dinner / late night dessert cravings. Zinc Bistro makes from scratch an amazing Chocolate Souffle that comes with your choice of chocolate, mint or Gran Marnier sauce. If you decide to dine in make sure you place your order before dinner as it takes about 30 minutes to prepare. For dessert goers who have dined else ware, Zinc Bistro's souffle preparation time is perfect to make a little room while enjoying a glass of wine or coffee.
