ysJo5Jdo29XOBCnKrbUKWg I can't really find a reason why you wouldn't go to this place. It has the ambiance you would expect, very good French food, the coffee here is excellent and the staff is nice. The prices, especially for the lunch combination special,  are very reasonable. I would recommend it for any occasion date, friends or just to stop by for some great coffee.
