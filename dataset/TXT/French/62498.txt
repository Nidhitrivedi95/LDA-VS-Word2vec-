SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ My wife and I celebrated our 50th anniversary at the House; we have eaten there before and have decided it is our "go to" place for special occasions. Our server was attentive, friendly, and well versed in the preparation of various menu selections. Our meals (6 oz steak and Texas wild boar enchiladas) were excellent, as were the beef enchilada soup and shaved Brussels sprout and beet salad, which we shared. We passed on dessert due to being full from our meals, but several of them sounded yummy when our server described them. My only disappointment was the noise level; it was quite noisy in the small room we were in, but that was due to some large groups of diners enjoying Holiday party cheer. It's not been a problem other times we've dined there. Highly recommended for events you want to be memorable!
