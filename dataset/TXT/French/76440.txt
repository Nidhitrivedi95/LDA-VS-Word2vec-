Yp9w4nhUowBU_IS_StFXbQ Tableau serves the food for the Tower Suites pool and I LOVE their chicken fingers & fries. I literally stay at the Tower Suites JUST FOR their chicken fingers! It is sooooo crispy and the fries are amazing. The chips with guac and salsa is good too! It comes with a huge portion! 

I have also had the red sangria pitcher and guava margarita blended from the pool menu. Not too memorable.
