U1LB3sRMGTu_h7Sf9QdNoA We happened upon this little spot totally by accident. We were so charmed by it's existance on a side street that we changed our plans and decided to have breakfast. After being seated on the outdoor patio we almost changed our minds....the gentleman who was host/server was a little biting and long in visiting the table. I suggested to my sister to pretend we were in France. Once he caught up things went swimmingly. I got the Croque Madam- yum. She got the french toast- again yum especially the caramel sauce to pour on it. Coffees were great.

There is seating inside which accomidates larger parties. The menu spans the gambit from omeletes to quiche to several eggs benedicts to varieties of crepes. Inside there is also a case of exquisite pastries to pick from.

A few days later we stopped by to grab croissants and sit in the park across the way to break the fast. That was a great idea.
