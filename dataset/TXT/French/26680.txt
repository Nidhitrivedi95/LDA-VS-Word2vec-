Da6eZFThE9xanUAGNpZxAg Came here fresh from Toronto Pearson, for a snack and a couple drinks while waiting for a late dinner. The place has the look of a small, unassuming cafe, which is what most people seemed to be using the space for. I saw a group of people near the front with computers out, but there was a full bar, as well as a few parties enjoying some charcuterie, so there was definitely a range of clienteles.

I was told that the ribs was the go-to thing on the menu, and the charcuterie was calling out to me as well, but I declined reluctantly, simply because I had dinner plans in a few hours. I went for the smoked sausage arancini, and an old-fashioned. Weird combination, for sure, but I didn't quite care, as I was slightly delirious from my 42-minute airplane ride from LGA. A rough life, indeed. The arancini came out pretty quickly, and they were enormous, with 4 to an order. About the size of a jumbo egg, the crispy fried rice balls were oozing with a LOT of melted mozzarella, and the smoked sausage had a really good spicy flavor. Pretty bomb. 

The old-fashioned was very well-made, and quite strong with a generous pour. After my old-fashioned, I tried one of the local (and I mean local) brews from Lost Craft Beer. I felt quite special, as the beer was small-batch brewed in Toronto, and there wasn't much availability. The Revivale lagered ale came in a limited edition all-white tallboy can, which was pretty cool-looking. The beer itself was delicious and refreshing, and had a really crisp taste. 

Service was great at the bar. The bartender, Tess, was really great with recommendations, as well as recommendations for what to see in Toronto. Prices were a bit on the more expensive side, but I think the value is there, as the portions are very generous for the price. Overall, the experience was seamless, and I really enjoyed the welcoming atmosphere. Will easily make a return trip on my next stint in Toronto. Gonna have to try those signature ribs!
