SBnpT6JDbah-5l_52GM5sw Hi - 
We came here to meet friends on Sunday Brunch after the Madison Marathon.

First - the address "617" points you to the "entrance" at 617 Willy st - which is NOT a real entrance.  Wish they had a small friendly sign to inform you to "walk around" to the lakeside "real" entrance... we gueassed at that.

We were here for the Brunch time eats... after the Marathon.
Had a small group, and a rez - and were quickly seated - not crowded anyway.  
Our server was "Spencer".
Everything was pretty much fine, except for Specncer.
We order drinks - he forgot two - had to be reminded.
We order our lunch time meals...
ie - Omelettes with spring salad and frites
Spinach, roasted cherry tomatoes, goat cheese and bacon * 10
This was really good - finished it all - and the "french fries" (frites) are real thin and crunchy - great.

Some others had sandwiches - some had the Frittata - all were  good

Various plate servers brought out our meals, but Spencer was not to be found.
He never came over to see how things were going, etc...

Next was dessert - we flagged Spencer, and all ordered things to share.
All were great - but he mixed up one order.... we didn't bother at this point.

SO - for our Brunch, it was a really nice time, great and unusual pairings for the lunch time menu....  Everything would have been great - except for Spencer.

We then had a table discussion about the "tip".... since the bill was over $100.
How do you communicate your "rating" to the server ?
Do you chat, write on receipt, talk to mgr, what ?
I felt sorry - paid the total bill - and left a 12% tip
