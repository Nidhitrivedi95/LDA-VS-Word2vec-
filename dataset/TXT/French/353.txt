-4TMQnQJW1yd6NqGRDvAeA What a fantastic experience, I had a work group of 12 people scheduled for dinner on a Sunday night, got to the House, no reservation in there system, my admin in Chicago dropped the ball, I'll deal with that later, the staff at the restaurant gave a big "it's not a problem give us a few minutes to set the table" all is good. We order cocktails really good from beers, martinis and mules all excellent. Apps around the table fantastic. Salad and soups came out quickly, then we had a delay for entrees, the manager comes out and informs us that there POS system had crashed, not good! But the team recovered quickly steaks were "perfect" other entrees way above average. Also the patios on a nice October night is down right beautiful. I highly recommend the House Brasserie!
