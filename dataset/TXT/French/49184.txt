OpYcHzNmEcsQ8vvk-ojDPw Ate there tonight. Gave the waiter complete carte blanche as to what to bring.

For entrees (appetizers for Americans) we had the lobster salad, fois gras and the cheese baked in pastry. All three were great. Ranked in order from best to 3rd best it was fois gras, baked cheese and then the lobster.

For mains, we had the venison (mmmmmm, yummy) and the rabbit (ok, but would try different next time).

For dessert, we shared the Chai cream. Also very good.

The overall experience was outstanding. Waiter was perfect, even bringing our 8 year old a bowl of french fries (clearly not on the menu) without us requesting it.
