O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q Was in Vegas for the weekend with the family. We stayed at the Palazzo and I decided on taking my parents out to a nice dinner. We didn't really need to look far at other high end restaurants as Morel's and another steak house was in the hotel. Morel's didn't have high reviews but I based my decision on the posted Yelp pictures. 

I made a reservation through Open Table but didn't really need make a reservation for Saturday night dinner on the long Memorial Day weekend (it wasn't that packed). 

Experience and atmosphere was nice. Patio seating is available that overlooks Las Vegas Blvd and Treasure Island/Wynn/the mall (corner view). The service was awesome and the food was delicious. We had steaks, pasta and the raw oysters. A plus was that Morel's had a children's menu!! SCORE! You seldom have children's menus at high end places, this helped out as I had my young son with me. Raw oysters ($20 for 1/2 dozen) was super fresh and tasty. My "prime" rib eye Bordelaise was good ($66) but a bit over cooked, I asked for medium rare and it was almost medium. Mom's linguini clams was good, the pasta sauce was perfect for dipping the bread and Morel's added tons of clam. 

Overall a good dinner with my parents, we all enjoyed Morel's and I would recommend it to others.
