Because it's not only a steakhouse, you get a fantastic menu with seafood, steaks, poultry and a small amount of vegetarian fare. I chose the dijon steak frites option and it was excellent. I almost went for the pork chop but really needed a dose of iron. I had the caesar to start and it was quite unique; the chili oil definitely gives it a kick. You can barely taste the anchovy, which some people would like. 

The wine and spirits is list is impressive and the ambiance is fantastic; dark and romantic. It's a bustling environment just like a busy cafe along the streets of Paris. But a look outside the 'windows' has you starting at slot machines.

Definitely make a reservation through OpenTable before approaching as the line runs long most evenings.
