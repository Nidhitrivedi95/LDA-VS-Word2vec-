4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Excellent! Wish i found this spot earlier in our trip.  I had "PARIS ROMANCE" drink.  Very good.  We had baked brie app. .. my only complaint was i wish there was more.  I had classic steak frites....mmmmmm. really good.  My partner had warm goat cheese salad.  She said it was great.  Don't miss this spot!
