4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw This place is terrific. I make sure that we go here every time we visit Vegas. There is nothing better than sitting out on their patio, eating delicious food and people watching. There is sometimes a wait, but it is well worth the wait. Service here is top notch and we have never had a bad experience. 

They have daily specials which is what I normally order. I had the Bananas Foster Crepes last time. They were fantastic. Paired with some fresh squeezed orange juice and a bowl of Cafe Au Lait and I was in heaven. Their omelets and eggs Benedict are also tasty. I always find myself ordering the crepe special usually though. You must try this place while in Vegas. You will definitely not regret coming here.
