S5gtq6g6dIfyaFvyPYyzkg Just been for Christmas visit to the Dome and they have surpassed themselves this year with the decorations. It is a beautiful building at the best of times and at Christmas they go completely over the top with the christmas theme.


 The queues today were huge - we arrived at about 1.30 and went through to bar about 20 mins later, sat down for lunch about 20 mins after that. Sounds bad but they manage the queues really well - have 2 chaps making sure it all moves smoothly and are honest from the start how long it will take. We had lunch in the club room rather than the main room cos would have been well over and hr if we had wanted a table there.


 Drinks were quite expensive - I bought a round of glass of prosseco, orange and lemonade and a diet coke and was over £10!


 Lunch was lovely - big club sandwiches with chips for two of us and a caesar salad for other friend. Big portions and tasty. We paid about £16 a head and had another glass of prosseco each and teas and coffees at the end. Seemed ok.


 At this time of year - don't pop in for a quick snack, expect to queue and for it all to be rather leisurely. We all think they should bring mulled wine out to the queues to keep you happy :-) Would have given it 5/5 if they did that.
