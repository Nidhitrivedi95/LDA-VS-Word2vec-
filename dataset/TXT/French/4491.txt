I'm glad I went. My experience was lovely. Every dish was classic and spot on and my service was excellent. 

Gorgeous salad verte. Fresh gazpacho. Amazing pate and asparagus. 

They were even accommodating without reservations (at 11am on a weekday) and everyone was kind to my dining companion, my 7-year-old daughter.
