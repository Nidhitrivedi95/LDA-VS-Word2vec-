bRmb81XDG3E2SOHARBLTog Ho hum....I'm no fancy food expert.  I'm the type of person that would probably eat with my bare hands if I had to because well it's too fancy to use utensils....

Came here for a staff christmas party two years ago.  Granted I'm no fancy food connoisseur by any means.  

They had a prix fix menu, I think I got some kind of fried scallop, main dish and creme bruele.

I had steak and frites (that's fries for all you regular folk).  Steak was just ok, no HP sauce (see I told you I was food bumpkin!). 

Fried scalop tasted like something lower end than red lobster, the breading was very oily.  The creme bruele was ok, had a nice crisp top.

Service was equally meh, our group wasn't that big maybe 15 people tops and I found the head waiter to be standoffish.  BTW, he wasn't the one I asked for HP sauce.

Give me the keg anyday over this place for the price and value.
