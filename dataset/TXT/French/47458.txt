O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q I hate writing bad reviews. But sometimes it must be done. So here goes. 

I'll start with the good stuff first. Decor of the restaurant is absolutely beautiful.  I have dined here twice; once for brunch and once for dinner. In the morning the restaurant is so nice and bright. You can't tell from the entrance of the restaurant, but they have huge windows inside that brings in so much light into the restaurant.  Which is a nice change from being inside casinos all day!  They also have patio seating as well that looks out to Las Vegas blvd and treasure island. Service was great(one of the reasons I gave them three starts, not one).  

The bad. FOOD. So for brunch, my particular dish was half good half bad. The potatoes that were on the side were the worst.  It basically felt like they were premade earlier that day and sat around and once ordered, they were scooped and came delivered out to my dish.  They did not seem fresh at all. They were not hot.  They were cold and stale. The rest of my dish however was delicious. Now for dinner, I had the exact experience. My food just didn't seem hot or fresh. I had this crab appetizer that came with bread. And boy that bread looked toasted with butter. But once you took a bite into it... you regretted it instantly. It was so stale and not even warm!  That's when I came to the conclusion that they pre made some items on the menu and it just sits around. 

I would skip this place and just trek over to Bouchon in the Venezia tower. Sad to say since they have a great location. Right in the entrance of the palazzo. Not far from taxi and Las Vegas blvd.
