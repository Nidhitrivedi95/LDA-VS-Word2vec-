HcfwrlljJpfLh71znq47zw I've been to Martin Wishart so many times, and I have to admit its one of my favourite restaurants EVER, and I've been to many good eateries both at home and abroad. The atmosphere there is really good, and I can't commend it enough. Obviously the best thing about this place is the food, which is simply amazing. So well prepared, fantastically presented, with a really good wait time (quick compared to other 'posh' restaurants). You really can't beat the selection on the menu at Martin Wishar, and the prices aren't too bad either. The staff are also fantastic, which really leads me to recommend this restaurant. One of the best in Edinburgh!
