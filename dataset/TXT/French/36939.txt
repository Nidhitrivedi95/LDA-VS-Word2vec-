Wife ordered the cheese plate, I got the scrambled eggs with cream cheese and smoked slamon. Cheese plate was okay, but the toast points were like croutons, instead of grilled bread. Nothing but crunch.

Scrambled eggs were just that, a good helping of scrambled eggs piled on top of a dollop of cream cheese and some diced up smoke salmon hiding under there, too. Overall, kind of meh.

The complimentary crossiants we got to start, though, are worth a return visit. Butter would be better than the thin blueberry syrup/compote they came with, but they were great!

The server brought us a couple of desserts to try. The apple pie was good, the rum pudding was way too sweet for our taste.

If I lived in the neighborhood, I'd probably try it again and go for dinner. But I don't live in the neighborhood.

TIP: Looks like parking is at a premium here, so plan accordingly
