Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA Mix gives lounges a good name.

We went about a month ago on a Saturday night and it seems easy enough to get in free (if you're a hotel guest it's automatically free before 10pm, and they were giving free passes on the way to the lounge).

This is the place to go if you want something classy.  It's pretty small, which keeps the scene intimate and keeps a nice aesthetic.  The lounge is lined with booths and there is a decent size dance floor.  

The view is what really takes the cake though.  If you missed it on the elevator coming up you'll have ample time to enjoy it on the patio on the 64th story.  My recommendation?  GO TO THE BATHROOM.  Have you ever wished to piss whilst staring out into thousands of hotel rooms?  There's something deliciously voyeuristic about it.
