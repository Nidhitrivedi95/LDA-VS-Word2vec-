teTQU7TIPE0O_B1zN_239w Best turkey dinner in AZ. The atmosphere is nice and the food is a reasonable price. Be careful, it can get crowded. I wish I could tell you more about other dishes, but the turkey dinner is good that is all I ever get from here. I just can't get enough. Real turkey, real cranberry sauce, yum.
