4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Woohooooo!! Writing this review makes me want to fly to Vegas!
Mon Ami Gabi IS Vegas. I dine here every time I leave, just to end my trip with a BANG, after losing money on the slots. 

The outdoor patio is so romantic, the natural light glistens through the glass over your head, while seated inside a cool fanned room.

The seafood is as fresh as it gets. Order the seafood sampler.... So worth it! $50 for jumbo prawns, salmon ceviche, mussels, and more!

I've had their Ahi salad as well, and that was excellent! The vibe is not authentic or French, but its very open, relaxing, and that everyone around you in having an enjoyable time. 

I never make a reservation, who needs one in Vegas when you can put your name on the wait list and head over to the casino for 30 min?
