U2S9n1asjTTI_EvBFBNnAw At first I was actually confused about why this place only got two stars--the food was relatively good, the service was friendly, and then I got my bill.

What was advertised as 2-for-1 draft beers turned out to be way more complicated than buy-one-get-one-free would seem. Yes, you get one free, but only the same person does, so you're required to have two beers each. No bother, I probably would have had two beers anyway. But our server didn't tell us that. We heard it from a server at another table.

Fine, two beers each. Then our bill comes. Monsieur, there are four beer charges on our tab. Oh, he says, you had the pint. The special for the pint is that you get it at the price of the glass. It's the glasses you get 2-for-1. Nevermind I never asked what size you'd like or told you about the special. 

To me, when happy hours get this complicated, it's just not worth it.
