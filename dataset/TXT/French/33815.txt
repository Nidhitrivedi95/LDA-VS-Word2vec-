hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA I am always in search for the freshest food, consistent personal service & flavor which captivates me, leaving me wanting more!

Olivier & his family/staff have shown me ultimate perfection in their service & food.  This is a charming cafe with the best ingredients I feel good about eating.  I have told all my family, friends & customers about it.  I even drive from Green Valley to deliver this food to my customers all over town. 

They had me at green tea & veggie quiche, but I also found I love the variety of soups, fresh green juice made my way, the desserts (which I am ultra picky choosy about eating sweets & THIS is worth the calories), the salads & my favorite chicken sandwich.  They really have something great here.  Music at the right volume, nice seating & always a smiling face behind the counter. The Baguette Cafe has become my sanctuary in between work appointments, & my first choice when delivering lunch to customer offices!
