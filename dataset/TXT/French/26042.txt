d482l58ho0_IMdFkXX1F5Q We had a really nice dinner here at 6pm on a Saturday night. We were about 30 minutes late for our reservation, but it was actually pretty empty there and it wasn't a big deal.

THE SERVICE: Spot on, incredibly professional and prompt.

THE COST: $500 total (including tax/tip) for dinner for nine. A bit pricey, good for a splurge.

MUST-HAVES: That duck special I got!

THE FOOD: See below, and also see my photos for more details!

* Free bread basket - 4.5 stars
This was delicious. There were several types of breads, from a grain bread, to focaccia, to a cheddar-muffin-like bread. 

FRENCH CLASSICS
* Foie Gras Terrine (fig and apricot mostarda, brioche, toasted almonds. $23) - 4 stars
Tried a bite, the foie was very rich and tasty, and goes well with all of the components on this plate! It is quite pricey for a kind of sparse plate.

ENTREES
* Seared Sea Scallops (green asparagus, jambon de Paris, braised leeks, mushroom sabayon. $33) - 4 stars
As my boyfriend put it, "quite good!" He really enjoyed this (and orders scallops a lot). I took a bite and agree!

* Crispy Duck Confit (Braised kale, caramelized onions, white beans, natural jus. $34) - 3.5 stars
The kale and white beans were really tasty complements. The duck had a good crisp, but it was very salty, and a little dry in places.

* Duck breast special - 4.5 stars
Very delicious. Incredibly tender meat, juicy, and surprisingly the cherry glaze on top worked! (I'm not usually a big fan of cherry.)
