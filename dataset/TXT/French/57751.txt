rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A This is was one of my most enjoyable lunches I had during my recent business trip in Vegas.  I've heard much about Thomas Keller, the man behind Bouchon and French Laundry in Napa.  Thus, I could not pass up the opportunity to try one of his restaurants so conveniently within reach.  I arrived towards the end of its lunch hours and was seated immediately without wait.  I ordered the Croque Madame with a slight amount of hesitation because at its core, I was ordering a ham and cheese sandwich covered in sauce an an egg.  The wait for the food took a little longer than I had expected, but to my surprise, the waiter offered me a free mocha to apologize for the delay!  When the food came, I had absolutely no regrets.  The Croque Madame was absolutely delicious, and I could not have been happier with my decision.  To top it all off, I was given a second complementary espresso to go as I was on my way out.  Excellent service and food.  Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a nice lunch experience.
