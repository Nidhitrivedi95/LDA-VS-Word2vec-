rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A NOTE: This review is for their brunch.
*I've had dinner here with family and extended family visiting from abroad. That was a long time ago, but the dinner was okay and the service was LONG - I'll have to go with people more willing to try bistro food next time.

*I've also stopped by the original bakery in Yountville to get macarons as well as eaten at THE French Laundry. Check my bookmarks for my TFL review.

I've had this place on my Vegas foodie radar as it was well known for their brunch menu. No1DP and I wanted to grab brunch nearby before my scheduled pickup to the aiport.

CONCEPT: Bistro fare from Thomas Keller, known for his restaurants at The French Laundry in Yountville and Per Se in New York.

VENUE: Located in the Venezia Tower you have to take an elevator from the Venetian to get to a bridge that will take you to the entrance of the restaurant. Though you can look out from the bridge there isn't much of a view of the outside.

SERVICE: When the No1DP and I arrived at 1:00ish there wasn't much of a wait. Approximate wait was ~25-30 minutes and I gave my phone number to text when our seats were ready. Bar was open seating and we went to actually eat at the bar but 5 minutes later I got a text alert saying our table was ready. 

At the beginning of the meal your server will tell you about the daily specials, but for reference there are blackboards scattered all across the restaurant that lists what those specials are. Service throughout the meal was good.

FOOD
After your order, you get epi bread along with butter and jam. The epi bread was a bit tough on the outside yet slightly soft on the inside. Butter was very smooth and creamy and was close in composition to the butter I had at The French Laundry. 

As the waiter was reading off the specials the No1DP and I heard about a special that caught our eye - the rock shrimp hash. Shrimps came with a poached egg and more importantly the brioche bread that Bouchon is also known for. 
-Poached egg was PERFECT. Sauce was creamy but not heavy, the egg is SOFT and yolky but not RUNNY so that your hash won't turn into a total mess.
-Shrimps were soft and flavorful. 
-Hash was full of vegetables and little potato. This ended up being one of the lightest hash dishes I've eaten. I really like a hash when it doesn't make me feel too stuffed due to the potato.
-Brioche bread was a bit crispy but it was slightly chewy on the center and buttery, similar to the brioche I've had at The French Laundry (which was the best brioche I've ever had).

No1DP and I also had freshly squeezed orange juice. The amount of pulp was just right.

After a sub-par dinner experience I would like to come back here to try more of their brunch dishes, especially the croque madame and chicken and waffles. This is also a must-stop if you are staying at the Venetian or Palazzo.
