4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Consistent great food at reasonable prices, with a great view of the Bellagio Fountain Show. We have been here 3 times now, and all 3 times we had a pleasant experience.

Cheese plate: okay, but nothing special
Smoked salmon appetizer: delicious!
Complimentary warm bread and room temperature butter: yummy
The republic of tea bottled ice tea (blackberry sage): I LOVE THIS TEA! Hard to find, and worth the $$
Steak roquefort and frites: DELICIOUS!
Special (arctic char): good
