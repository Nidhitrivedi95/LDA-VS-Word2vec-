rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Absolutely horrible service, actually non-service. We were sat relatively quickly at a corner table. The restaurant was barely half full. We were never offered water and the server never came over. We waited for 10 minutes and promptly walked out. There's way too many good restaurants in Vegas than to be waiting and be ignored.
