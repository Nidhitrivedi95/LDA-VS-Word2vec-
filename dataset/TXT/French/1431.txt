_T7f2wUgNlJqxsR-cR89SQ I can't believe I waited as many years as I have before finally trying a restaurant that has consistently appeared in the Toronto Top 10 list annually.

This place is hidden in a condominium with a view from the Avenue Rd. hilltop that gives a surprising and spectacular view of the city skyline from the north.  The ambiance is classy late seventies, early eighties, with velvet upholstered booths and mirrors throughout-  all well maintained.  It reminded me of what going out for a fancy dinner was like with my parents when I was a kid.

The wine list is excellent, with an accompanying sommelier for assistance.  Our table tried many of the appetizers including the Spec, Oysters and Shrimp Salad.  All as expected, with fresh local ingredients.  For entrees, I had the veal with came atop a homemade sour cream spätzle.  The veal was tender and pink, the spätzle stole the show.  Others had the filet and the presentation was outstanding.  They were out of the European Sea Bass. 

We all split a gorgeous piece of homemade coconut cream pie for dessert.

What you pay for here is the experience:  the service, view, wine list, and presentation.  We were there to celebrate our daughter's graduation, and will return for similar special occasions.
