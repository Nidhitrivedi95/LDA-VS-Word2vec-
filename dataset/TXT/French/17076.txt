9ET_RUNztevq4_OLAX80Gg Cafe Boulud is Daniel Boulud's first Toronto outpost fans of French cuisine will love it! I came here for brunch and had the truffle veloute and the french toast, so I do not feel I have had adequate experience with the menu to give a five star rating. That said, my meal was delicious and flawlessly prepared. 

The location and vibe is lovely, with interesting artwork and lots of glass windows. Service was very friendly, even on a busy Sunday morning. The veloute was perfectly seasoned topped with a boiled quail egg, and the presentation was very pleasing. The french toast was awesome as well, with blueberries and fresh cream. Ingredients are clearly high quality. I haven't been for dinner but the menu looks promising. 

Great spot for brunch, excellent food as expected from  the Boulud name.
