4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw This restaurant is very beautiful and very popular!  I mean, look at how many reviews they got on Yelp and out of all these reviews from fellow Yelpers, to get 4 out of 5 should tell you something!  My hubby and I went to dinner here with his aunt and uncle, who they are frequent customers of Mon Ami Gabi.  It was our first time to eat there, and we both enjoyed it.  The service was excellent, the decor was very nice, and the food was delicious!
