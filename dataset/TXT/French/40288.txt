KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA Finally! The meal I have been waiting for in Las Vegas.  Amazing atmosphere, delicious food, exceptional service, and a reasonable price tag. Do yourself a favor and eat here tonight!
I will first reiiterate what others have said...the wine shop in the front is such a great idea.  The store has an excellent selection and something for every price range.  My one regret was that we had to drive home and I  couldnt enjoy this feature even more.  
My boyfriend and I started with the beet salad.  It was light, flavorful, and beautifully presented.  I was impressed with how the chef paired the fish with the beets so succesfully. 
For the entree my boyfriend had the cod.  It was smooth and buttery and served on a lovely pilaf.  I have to say my entree- a special that evening- was certainly the best.  Salmon with a wasabi creme sauce served over soba noodles with chunks of lobster...my mouth is watery just remembering it!
We decided on the bread pudding for dessert and the 20 minute wait time gave us a chance to sober up before the drive home.  The pudding reminded me of my mom's - served piping hot with lovely hints of cimmamon and a delightfully sweet warm rum sauce (i think i could have drank that sauce as a cocktail!)
Last but certainly not least...the atmosphere.  It was a breath of  fresh air to sit lakeside and watch the sun set as our spirits rose.  If you want a romantic, memorable, delicious dinner head to Marche Bacchus tonight!
