0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g 500th review for a special dinner :)

Picasso has been on my list for years now! I went to visit my boyfie a couple weeks ago with no expectations, but he had this dinner planned for weeks. GF appreciation dinners are simply the best :) 

The both of us opted for the 4 course prix fixed menu so we could order different things and try 8 different things. For the first course we had soup and the poached oysters. The soup was good, but lukewarm. The poached oysters were out of this world! 10/10 would order the poached oysters over and over again. 
The second course we ordered the foie gras and salmon. The foie gras was served in pate form with dessert type pie/tart. I really did not understand this dish and just could not swallow it. I had the boyfie eat this dish because it was just not my cup of tea. He did not even end up eating the tart/pie crust part either. The salmon was amazing and perfectly cooked. The only downside was that it looked like farm raised salmon. 
The third course was lobster and halibut. Both were great! I'd highly recommend going with all the fish dishes here because those were the best cooked/tasting. By the dessert course I thought I was going to explode so we ended up sharing the peach dessert. Yummy. 

We also went with the wine pairing which was just OK. All the wines by itself were great, but I just didn't feel like each one complimented the dishes perfectly. I wish we had just ordered a bottle and saved the extra $$$. 

The service was good, but not amazing. Not sure how this place used to carry 2 michelin stars, but it felt more like a 1 star restaurant. The view of the fountain show made up for most things though :) This is a very romantic, intimate setting. The food wasn't A+, but it was such a special dinner. Worth a try.
