mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q Awesome and priced like it. Excellent food, the wine paring was phenomenal. I have to give a slight edge to the more formal Joël Robuchon next door, but this place was a lot of fun, and we got to watch the kitchen at work, which was a treat all in itself. Great place for a special occasion.
