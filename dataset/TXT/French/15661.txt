6fPQJq4f_yiq1NHn0fd11Q My love affair with crepes was rekindled last year during a visit to Paris, France.  Since then, I have tried, with varying degrees of success, to find excellent creperies.  La Creperie definitely meets the grade - in fact, these are the best crepes I've tasted since France.

The pancake part of the crepe has a wonderful thickness, it's substantial, not thin and skinny.  All the crepes I had: ham and cheese, three cheese, and the pear crepe - were fantastic.  My only regret is that I didn't have more opportunity to try some of their other crepes, before coming home to a comparatively crepe-challenged area!
