4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I have to knock off a star bc of the wait time for the patio.  We have been here numerous times, and I know the patio doesn't take reservations. But a 1 & 1/2 hour wait at 5:30 is a little crazy.
That being said, the food is always amazing! I usually get some sort of steak, and hubby gets either the skate or some sort of braised short ribs.  Never had a bad waiter or bad food here. 
Bottom line, if you want the patio (and the people watching is second to none), expect a wait. It would be better if they could text you when your table was ready, as the sensors only work a short distance in the casino. But the food is worth the wait
