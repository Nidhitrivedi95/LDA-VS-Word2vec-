or4UVDjXEEjze3wNPjoAZA I've been here a million times and usually have lunch at the bar.  This is the classic french brasserie style restaurant.  With a nod to Balthazar restaurant in NY's Soho this is a fun place.

This visit I sat at the bar and had the curry chicken sandwich on toasted sourdough.  I think that toasting the bread on any sandwich makes it better.  The sweet curry flavor make this sandwich a winner.

Sean may be the best bartender in Scottsdale.  He is always friendly and very efficient.

Definitely stop in here the next time you're at Kierland Commons.
