O66Zy8Y13VBm72ZDhS4fIg Went there on a date on a Saturday night
- service level - excellent
- ambience - excellent - they had piano playing and it was very romantic - a good place to chat, relax, and enjoy your meal
- food - very good in my opinion - i think they taste even better with the soft piano music in the background, which i really loved... 
- price point - ok for the portion, quality, and ambience

I really liked the color scheme, and decor in there - very stylish! I find it modern and calming. I would certainly recommend this place for special occasions or a get together with friends to splurge and relax for a meal out. I would go back there for sure.
