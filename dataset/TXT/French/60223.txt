SBnpT6JDbah-5l_52GM5sw Sardine is our go-to brunch spot. It's always busy but if you call the night before or morning of for a noon-ish spot you're good.
Tie for best Bloody Mary in the city with Graze. Food is great bistro Belgian-style fare (muscles, frites, etc.), great oysters as well. Decor is a similar French/Belgian seaside bistro feel, with lots of light. Staff is always great.
