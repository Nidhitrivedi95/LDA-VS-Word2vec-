rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A This review only pertains to the midweek breakfast offerings at Bouchon, our party of two enjoyed a Noon seating on Wednesday.  We were hoping to eat on the patio, but alas it was just too hot yesterday when we arrived (maybe early in the AM is best for that) and we decided against it, although there are very spacious umbrellas there for coverage from the hot hot Vegas sun. 

We enjoyed the fresh squeezed OJ, sourdough waffles (with strawberries and vanilla bean butter), brioche french toast (with paper thin apple slices and cinnamon), side of perfectly crisp bacon and a yogurt parfait.  I wanted so much to ask for a side of beignets, but realizing that we were already approaching carbohydrate overdose I held myself back.  

Speaking to the fluffy brioche french toast, it was lovely and the perfect size for a breakfast dish, not sickly sweet.  We ended up adding two scrambled eggs on the side and they appeared on our table very fast.   All in all, Bouchon was the perfect meal for a late breakfast, a peaceful morning dining experience in the middle of Vegas hustle and bustle.

I just woke up the half-asleep boyfriend to ask if he wanted to add anything to the review and he said, "it was really good."
