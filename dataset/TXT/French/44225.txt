ME6D5nLlfG0xZCtICOYDuw How does one rate a place that serves tasty food that sadly makes them deathly ill the next morning? 

Well, let's begin with the facts. I came to this establishment with three guests. 

The decor was nice. The atmosphere was quiet. I believe we were one of two tables being served on this particular night. 

My party and I all tried a shrimp dish, which was one of their specials. The flavor was good.

Service was slow, especially since it was a fairly slow night. 

The next morning, all of my friends were sick, as was I. Coincidence? Perhaps. 
Or it could have been the shrimp.

It will take me a while to gain the courage to give George's a second try. Right now, I can't even think about it without feeling nauseous. 

Luckily, it seems like this was perhaps a fluke, for some of my other friends have had good experiences here. No restaurant is perfect.
