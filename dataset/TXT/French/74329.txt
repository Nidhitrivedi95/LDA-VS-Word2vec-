xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g Taking into account the service, quality of food, price, and the unparalleled views, I highly recommending coming to the Eiffel Tower Restaurant for a special dinner date. 

I brought my bf here for his bday weekend and our first meal off the plane at 10pm was at The Eiffel Tower restaurant. While everybody raves about their views, I think they are seriously underrated for their food. Every single dish that we ordered was amazing. Our waiter was ridiculously attentive without being in your face. The entire restaurant gets gorgeous fountain views at the perfect height. If you make a reservation for 2, they tend to seat you at the window at these cute couple tables where you both sit face next to each other and enjoy the strip view. 

We ordered about 6/7 dishes, including a lobster corn chowder with crab flan (huge chunks of juicy lobster scattered throughout a creamy corn chowder, embellished with a chunk of crab flan), foie gras and warm pear appetizer, the beef wellington (huge portions and unlike anything I've had before, good flavor), an amazing veal entree, and 1 dessert + 1 complimentary dessert for his birthday. Everything was stellar... I didn't have EXTREMELY high expectations so me and my taste buds were ever so thrilled all night. Best part was, our two-person birthday dinner with drinks came to $270 total including tax and a generous tip. Very reasonable in my opinion... Keep in mind we ordered enough food for 3-4 normal people. :) 

A special night! 

It would be really hard for one to have a bad night here. Even if it's just for a drink or dessert, or a snack, it's worth the experience.
