ucgzkl7atsBMGu4gGpmHfw Great spot for a good lunch, nice atmosphere and some great people watching if you sit up front.

I have walked by this place a hundred times without realizing it is there. Not until I saw it on CTV's The Listener did I see it and wanted to give it a try.

Now I am sure I will be popping by there regularly for a good unrushed lunch for a surprisingly pleasant price. Their menu is extensive and very appealing, so I have a long list to try.
