vv7HKwsG6tloU4xho7QUBQ I finally got in for a meal here last week after several months of saying that I should, and was not disappointed. This is the kind of vegetarian food that even carnivores could appreciate and enjoy! It doesn't have the usual vegetarian whiff of lentils and pulses in the dining room, and the atmosphere is really special. Service was attentive but not overly so, and every course was fresh, perfectly cooked, and well-presented.
