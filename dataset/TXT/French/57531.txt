rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Ate here for brunch this past weekend and also ate here 2 months ago when I visited Vegas. This place is a ways to find in the Venetian, but once you try it ,it's like a little bit of Paris in a plate . Classy and fancy. Service was ok both times I've been here. The free baguette was hard (as it should be) so I skipped out on that. Their truffle fries r absolutely delicious! The fruit plate was great -- a little small,but there seemed to be some kind of spice flavoring on it which was very interesting to the palate- I actually enjoyed it. Fresh squeezed orange juice was ok. I just didn't understand why they serve warm water? No ice. Is this how they serve water in France? Anyways, that was a little odd or at least offer with or without ice? I ordered the chicken and waffles-- it was good. The waffles had a hint of bacon and chive in it I think. Different yet tasty! The chicken was cooked well paired with an onion sauce-- the sauce was amazing-- ask for extra ! Goes great with the chicken! . The husband ordered the corned beef hash in which he seemed to like with the 2 over easy eggs on top. Overall, I'd come back if I was staying here. Price point was $$$. But you'd have to see the place to understand why.. Too bad I didn't get to try their pastries =\
