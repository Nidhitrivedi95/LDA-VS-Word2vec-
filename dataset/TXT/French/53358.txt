QEgfK_TKY8bwK-YzKDdkGw No way 5 star experience. Y'all are nuts.

5 star service yes. Everybody super, super nice. I'd go back in a heart beat and give them one more try...

Lobster bisque was salty. Nothing jumping out of the bowl fantastic. Just salty. 

Moroccan date salad needed some restraint. Too much date = too cloying sweet.

Wild Mushroom salad good but heavy.  Lot of egg (which was very tasty- could tell these are quality). Lot of bacon, lot of mushroom. I liked the flavors very much but back off a tad, chef .Little goes a long way. 

Sea Bass an epic fail. Over cooked bleh. Why is it I make better seafood at home? 
Also- brown fish on a plate of brown lentil and mushrooms = no color. Just brown.
Dish needs some zest, some freshness, some color. 1.5 star entree .

Step up your game. Charlotte is depending on you....
