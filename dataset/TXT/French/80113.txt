zw4Legbcu018p5WcZ74iWA Just a warning, you will never be able to sit down. ever. Comfort aside, this place is great, vegan and vegetarian friendly, good ethics, cute spot. Really nice in the summer to stop in and get a snack, then eat in the park across the street. There is a lot of pushing, complaining and long lines at PatatiPatata, but that's only because it's good. Everyone gets served...eventually.
