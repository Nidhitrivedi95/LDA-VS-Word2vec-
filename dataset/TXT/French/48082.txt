O66Zy8Y13VBm72ZDhS4fIg My fav place in Toronto~~~

We go to Sass once to twice a week during summer, they have the best PATIO and the lounge! 

Let's talk about their FOOD ( Not Summerlious/Winterlious crap!) it's simply great!! Can't go wrong with anything from salad to steak. 

One thing I found out......They are big on supporting local farmers, use local products most of times and they also use Bullfrog Power (Green electricity) 
Locals supporting locals!! Why not!!

I had my baby shower, birthday dinners etc....

But what makes me to go back to Sass!?? THE STAFF!!! (I hope they get pay well, they changed a number of General managers and ... hmmmm..., hey Sass owners, I'm sure you already know but just a friendly reminder that you have to pay well to retain good people)

P.s.

I wish I had my wedding reception there, too late, one marriage is enough for me lol, (persuading my soon to be married friends to have theirs at Sass)
