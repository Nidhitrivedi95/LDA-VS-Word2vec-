We were on a quest for the best chocolatine in Montreal and this was our first stop! 
This was tasty and served warm! However, it was a little smaller than others and nothing really stood out about it. It tied for 3rd in our final tally.

(As a sidenote, if you don't speak French and what is brought to you doesn't look like what you expected, ask! Don't eat it assuming you are incorrect, as we did.)
