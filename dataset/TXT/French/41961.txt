Kut9tVbDX_f7qKMRRoXg3w My husband and I stopped here for a late lunch and thoroughly enjoyed our entire experience.

We shared the fondue for two which is accompanied by a charcuterie platter. The fondue was very tasty and the meat platter was a nice touch.  This was more than enough for the two of us.

The price for the fondue seemed somewhat high but was well worth it.  The rest of the menu was priced affordably. 

The atmosphere of this small restaurant is quite unique with a strong European feel.  Our service was excellent, especially our waiter who was quite the character.

We will definitely return here and highly recommend this location for breakfast, brunch or lunch.
