XKPosZx2j4RHcZ8Ewdwj0A Lemeac is one of my go to restaurants when friends and family ask for a real "montreal" dining experience.  Have eaten here many times and it's always consistently good.  Also everything on the menu is good, I've never been disappointed with anything I've ordered.

It's an upscale bistro menu, and they usually offer a few specials each evening.  Went with a big group the other night to celebrate a graduation.  Started with the escargot, delicious in a creamy bed of basil flavoured foam.  Then the special of the night, the haddock, which was delicious and perfectly cooked.  They always do a nice job with fish.  In the past, I've tried both the salmon and steak tartare and they were excellent.  Portions are in the smaller side but the food is quite rich so you end up being quite full.

Skipped dessert but had an excellent espresso to round off the meal.  

They have a well chosen wine list, including a nice selection by the glass.  Service is professional and nicely paced, even with a big group on a busy night.
