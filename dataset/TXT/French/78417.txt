YVYHX7RCPjCBqEth2CS91Q As you have read from all of the other reviews, the service at Brasserie 33 stinks.  That's all you can really say.  Some say if you are looking for gourmet- not service, go here.  Seriously?!  If I'm spending the money on a roasted chicken, I should get served in an appropriate amount of time.  I shouldn't have to wave down a "water boy" for a refill of water.  I shouldn't have to flag down a server just for my check (our dinner plates were taken away 30 minutes prior- no one asked if we wanted dessert).  The food?  Yes, it's good.  The service will keep me from going back.  I can get better service at Denny's...
