T4g4k2OhCTsiqcP-ZXElHQ Yummy French bistro with very reasonable prices (most entrées are under $20) and a lovely, casual atmosphere. Line ups are not unusual around lunch time but if you go just when they open (11:30, I believe) or closer to 1pm it's often easier to get a table.

Everything I've had has been great, and the service is for the most part friendly, prompt, and attentive without being overbearing. Highly recommended.
