WOj8nPos3R9IIf0Pyttd8g I really wanted to like Lulu  but it was okay. I got the pork belly which was a bit tooo jelly instead of meat. hubby got the fettucini (hes not too adventurous so wanted to play it safe) It was dry with very little flavor. What bothered me was the service. There were only 3 tables of customers the night we went. Our waitress would disappear after giving us our food and we didnt see her for 35-40 mins! So to be on the safe side we asked for the check immediately so as to not have her disappear again. All in all an ok experience.
