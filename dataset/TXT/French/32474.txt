gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg This place has become a stand-by.  The quality of the food and the drinks are consistently good, but nothing to write home about, save for their Oktoberfest burger (more on that later).

As for beers, there's a nice selection.  I usually get a mix: the white mixed with some peach schnapps.  It's a nice, spirited, fruity beer drink that is quite agreeable to the ladies (and gents, as well).  The blond-beer burger is my favourite main. Though you can't order the burger medium-rare, it's a good size, and tastes really good.  

Skip dessert here, and don't be tempted by any of the "flamms" (sweet or savoury).  They're too crunchy, too thin, and the toppings are sparse.  

My favourite dish here has to be the Oktoberfest burger.  It's a delicious juicy burger topped with... PULLED PORK!  The plate is served with lengthy, toothsome, and crisp sweet-potato fries.  Why can't they serve it year-round?  All I can say is that this dish has me jonesing for the autumn months.
