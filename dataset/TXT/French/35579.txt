htQgj-ANQpZGpIpkkrEmyQ I came here with my friend on Saturday October 16. 

My friend had made reservations to celebrate my birthday. I have tried to dine here before but unfortunately the other times I have came they were packed and the wait was 30 minutes to an hour. This time we didn't wait at all we were seated by the window. I did you know that the wall around the window is actually wood made to look like the NYC city skyline. Me and my friend were both very intrigued. 

I had the inspire burger and she got the salad. I couldn't try any of her salad because I have a nut allergy but it's smell had a lot of Thai flavours which is what said on the menu.

The burger was soooooooo good! It was cooked to a medium rare. The flavours were really interesting, I liked the Asian style pork belly fused with the American burger flavour. And also the brioche bun was soooooooo good. 

The only negative I have is that when we were trying to pay a lot of the servers had their heads down, so it was hard to get their attention. 

But a solid 4/5! Will come again!
