gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg Being a regular costumer for few months now, I always feel welcome. Not every Waiter / Waitress is the same, but some are just better. Amazing service at the bar! You have to ask for Iva ! Great variety of drinks, beers are local and they taste great. The food is always served quick and the order is made right. With great ambiance, and welcoming service, a good way to relax after a work day. They made a costumer for months now. I recommend the place.
