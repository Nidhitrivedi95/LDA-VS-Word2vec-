3FlWR_osNPb8dcqLgHebHw I took my wife out for her favorite eggs benedict. It was a bit late for breakfast but they still served it at 2 pm. The food was great, servings large and service prompt and attentive. They even offered eggs benedict with salmon instead of ham. But the Sam Adams French Onion soup - BEST EVER! I could have made that the whole meal.
Nice atmosphere. I had the turkey reuben which was perfect for me since I quit eating beef. Huge sandwich but tasty. Made me a winner in my wife's eye which was well worth it.
