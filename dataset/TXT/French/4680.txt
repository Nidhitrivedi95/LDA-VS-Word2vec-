I am interested in trying their grilled calamari and bacalhau but I don't think I've ever seen it on display - maybe they weren't serving it the days I was there.

Just a heads-up that parking is a bit of a challenge because most of the stores in the plaza have spots reserved and you can't actually park on The Queensway. Depending on the time of day, you could park on Brawley (the side street) and just quickly run in and out.
