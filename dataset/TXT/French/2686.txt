I've been to many restaurants throughout the globe and it blows me away how good many of the restaurants are getting in LV. Out of the fifteen or so top that I've tried over the past four years in Vegas, Picasso takes the top rating. Not only that, it competes with numerous world class global eateries.

I was highly impressed with how good the food was, the beautiful presentation, the relaxed atmosphere (with Picasso artwork everywhere), and as important, the spectacular service. Dialed in and comfortably present without being seen.

Now, there's a price to pay. It was the most expensive dinner I've had in recent memory and quite possibly ever. This too was with only two bottles of $100 wine between three people. But you get what you pay for. In addition, the sommelier didn't make me feel cheap not wanting a $300 bottle of wine... in fact, the opposite. He read me well and recommended a fantastic bottle of pinot from the Loring Wine Company that I knew about from their whites. Well done all around.

Simply put, I loved this place. No doubt that I will be back.
