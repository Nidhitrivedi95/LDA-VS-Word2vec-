l09JfMeQ6ynYs5MCJtrcmQ Came here after a great walk, which meant we were hungry and thirsty.   We started off with fresh squeezed orange juice and some coffee.  Service was great and it wasn't crowded.

I had the eggs benedict.  I've never had them with mushrooms before.  It was great.  They did forget to put my holandaise sauce on the side (I must have offended the chef for asking) but I managed to scrape it off.  The potatoes and salad that came with it were also great.

A great spot for brunch.
