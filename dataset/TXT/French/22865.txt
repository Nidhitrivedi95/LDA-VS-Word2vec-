bzbNGyrTwWHAgg1CqkSgeg Like a previous reviewer, I was underwhelmed with the Full Breakfast that I ordered during my first visit to Terrace Cafe last week for lunch.  It wasn't bad, but for half the price I had the same thing at The Original Pancake House  this morning and enjoyed it just as much or possibly more.  Granted, I could have ordered something with a little bit more imagination, but if a restaurant can't handle simple things then I have to wonder whether or not it can handle more complex items.  

The hummus appetizer we ordered arrived with sesame seed covered pita for dipping.  Unfortunately, I can't say much for the hummus because it was completely overwhelmed by the flavor of the sesame seeds on the pita.  I'm not a fan of sesame seeds, so I took one bite and left it at that.  My companion ordered the tomato and mozzarella salad and really enjoyed it.  He also enjoyed the hummus more than I, but he likes sesame seeds so....

Thanks to a $30 gift certificate from Groupon, our lunch tab was only $18.00.  (I paid $12 for GC and left $6 tip.)  Without the GC, our tab would have been almost twice as much.  I'll try Terrace Cafe again because I have another gift certificate.  Hopefully next time I'll be as pleased with my meal as some of the other reviewers.
