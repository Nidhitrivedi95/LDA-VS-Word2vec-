b3wgQ6CccBO8fgvlbS0M1Q So far (after two visits) I love it here.  Armed with a menu, I called down to place a "to go" order.  You can't begin to imagine my delight when the guy answered the phone in a French accent so thick it was hard to understand.  I placed my order for the "half sandwich and side" deal (extremely reasonable at $5.60) and ran down to get it.  I ordered the mozzarella sandwich minus the prosciutto, and the pasta salad for the side.  Regular readers may know that in my opinion, nothing beats a good mozzarella sandwich, so I was absolutely thrilled to find that it was delicious.  Nice crunchy baguette, fresh mozzarella, and flavorful tomatoes.  The pasta salad was also very good... very simple, just cold pasta with some olive oil and seasonings.  I'm not a super adventurous eater, so while I loved the pasta salad I would guess that others might find it a tad boring.

Today I had the tomato basil ravioli soup, which was very good except that it was a little skimpy on the raviolis.  Flavor was delicious, though.  It comes with a few toasted slices of baguette.  Personally, next time I'll just order a fresh baguette to go along with it.

The entrees and full sandwiches are a little more pricey, but I'm a light eater, so the half sandwich/side deal is an absolute steal for me.  There's not a sandwich on the menu that doesn't sound mouth watering, and the desserts.... oh my god I wanted one of each.  Add in the extremely friendly service (who said Frenchmen were rude??) and I'm happy to say i've found my new lunch spot.

Edited to add:  As far as I can tell, they're open in the evenings too, so next time yo find yourself seeing a movie at the Esplanade, stop by Au Petit Four (right by the escalators) for some yum.
