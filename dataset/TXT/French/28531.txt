ehRigNzlkRQlvhzKr7PLCQ We love this place! We have driven by many times and had no idea how wonderful it is. The food is delicious and well presented, the servers (all volunteers!) are great, the decor is very nice and the prices are amazingly affordable! There is a bar inside, some tables outside and they have recently started a Sunday jazz dinner from 6-9pm which was fun!
