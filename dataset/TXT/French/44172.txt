MdjIl105vqCYUGKFSUVytA This is one of my favourite places to eat. The atmosphere is lovely, the staff are wonderful, the food is good, and the prices are quite reasonable. Brunch on a Saturday came out to be less than $25 (if you order a coffee and not a cocktail, after tax and tip). And the decor? Just absolutely beautiful. It's a fantastic place to celebrate an event or catch up with a friend.
