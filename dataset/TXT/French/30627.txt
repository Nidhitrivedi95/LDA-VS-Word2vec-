fVF5wayDyY6ZR5oJB1IK3g We chose this restaurant for its outstanding reviews, so we decided to try it for our anniversary dinner. It was a quiet evening, only one group of four people were dining in. We decided to try the fish platter, which is an arrangement of fish in different form and sizes. The platter is good for two and was really delicious, as there was a wide variety of fish. As for the starter, we shared the calamari salad with aioli and saffron. It was the best meal of the evening. Things went south after, when our main dishes arrived. The plates were extremely generous and too much salt in both plates. We couldn't eat it all and hard to taste other than the salt from the sauce. Sometimes, small plates with remarkable taste are more memorable than larger plates...even if they both cost the same price.  

As for service, it was quick and easy-going since there was not a lot of people. The waitress was kind to suggest wine not from the menu. 

Overall, it was a good dinner, but not enough for us to return as there are so many good (and better) restaurants in Montreal for the same price (around 200$ for 2). Maybe we will try their brunch someday.
