VwZhwflLnTq19aAeFLJHCQ I agree with previous posters: it is a gem for Henderson. Chef Bernard is nice, Roger, the manager makes sure you are treated very nice. I live very close and I go there once a week. Food is delicious but I have to say is not 5 stars. There is always something left wanting: the calamari are a little on the oily side and too little compared to the onions. The french onion soup is indeed The best. The meatloaf is drenched in tomato sauce and, sorry, but is too acidic. The crepes sound like a good idea but they always come out too dried from the oven and you end up having to cut the ends out. They have indeed amazing pasta, schnitzel, and sandwiches. I would never go again for fish and chips, nor steak and fries, you can do better some other place. The flat breads are worthy! 
I see they incresed the prices a little bit, very little.
I am waiting for them to create the patio, put some greens, some potted flowers, maybe a little enclosure, to hide the street traffic. The brunch is not superior in terms of value and the sauces are a little on the heavy side for brunch. 
The wines are overpriced for the quality, but hey...
Finally, the sangria is really, really good.
The atmospehere is always select, great people coming in, I even saw local celebrities! 
All in all, I am happy they are here, I wish them the best and I will continue to regularly come in.
