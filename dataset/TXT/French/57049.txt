rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Went back for the chicken & waffles.  Good Lordy!  Who can say no to roasted chicken with bacon & chive waffles?  Not anyone at our table.

"I'll take the chicken & waffles"
"Me too"
"And me"
"Really? Well I'll do it too then"
"Make that five, please?"

Two words:  WORTH EVERY SINGLE FREAKING PENNY!
