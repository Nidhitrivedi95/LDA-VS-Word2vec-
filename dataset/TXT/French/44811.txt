mr4FiPaXTWlJ3qGzp4-7Yg This was a nice little surprise.  My Friend and I were planning on going to The Comrade which is 4 units West of Table 17 but their food selection was limited.  The Comrade bartender recommend this place so we thought we'd give it a whirl.  

There was a good feel to this two roomed restaurant, classy but not fancy.  There was a long wooden table in the middle of the 2nd room where the wait staff cut bread and got their serving supplies from which I thought was a nice touch.  The waitress we had was extremely helpful in her recommendations, both in food and drink and cute as could be.

I will return.
