ohMpNug5zWNxOlL6ShG7Ig Binkley's is my all time favorite restaurant so I had to try their new cafe in Carefree.   
When we went on a Thursday lunchtime they had only one other table occupied, joined later by several tables of older Scottsdale ladies who lunch. 
My husband had the Cuban pork sandwich which was good but not as tasty as the Havana Cafe version.
I had the country pate with pistachios and toast, which was also very good, however, it felt lacking in something. Perhaps a marmalade of some type would have worked better for me than the curried mustard.
We shared a large portion of fries.  These fries have won awards but to be honest they didn't do anything for me.  They are fried, chilled and refried to give them fluffy insides and crispy outsides, served with truffle ketchup, garlic aioli and dill dip.  Ours were limp, over salted and tasted of olive oil.  
The wine list is good and reasonably priced.   We also had steam beer which was excellent
Dessert was a delicious peach cobbler.  A long plate with honey ice-cream resting on a bed of chopped toasted hazelnuts, hot fresh peach slices topped with light crumbly topping and on the side caramelized peach slices and a wafer thin ginger snap.  Note to self: order your own portion next time, don't agree to share.   
Service was a tad slow but pleasant enough.  There seemed to be only 1 server for the whole restaurant. 
The location was easy to find with good views of the mountains but located right next to a busy road. If you sit outside under the sail it can be noisy.   
If you go expecting Binkley's you will be disappointed.  The food is good but not in the same class and neither is the price.  For a cafe it is good food and good value. If it was closer to my house I would go  again but I wouldn't make a special pilgrimage as I would for Binkley's.
