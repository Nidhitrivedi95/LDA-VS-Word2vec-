xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g Two stars for the beautiful view. My 3rd visit to Vegas and this place had been on my bucket list, and it turned out to a complete disappointment.

Made a dinner reservation for our anniversary, as we sat down the waitress greeted us with a wine and cocktail list, I've kinda noticed she was waiting for us to order drinks or bottle before giving the dinner menus, in about 5 minutes sommelier stoped to see if we had questions ( by working in this industry I know pretty much about wines and was taking my time looking at the list) just give us dinner menus already!

The whole time being in this place made me feel so obligated and uncomfortable, I know this is place is stands for the view, in NYC we have plenty of high end restaurants with the view and we know what's that all about but our waitress kept on being pushy and make us order more then of what we want, 

We wanted to share the ribeye and she said unfortunately they were out of ribeye and recommended something else and pointing out that we should have one of our own each ( stop trying to up sell and just concentrate on your service and knowledge first ) and we picked a side to it (potato gratin) and she asked if we wanted some mushroom sauce with it because steak doesn't come with any and we said sure, AFTER GETTING THE BILL THERE WAS A CHARGE OF $15 for side of mushroom that we didn't even ordered and if she suggested something she has to let the guests know that there's gonna be an up charge.

Our night was ruined after of being rushed and feeling uncomfortable we did not even want to stay there no more we asked for the rest of our food to go after getting to the hotel and opening boxes we only found the potato gratin and side of mushroom and NO ANY STEAK. Here $200 went down the drain. 

Stay away from this place. Or just come for the view and have the cheapest glass of wine here because they don't worth your money. Horrible experience.
