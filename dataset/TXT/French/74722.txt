xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g Absolutely one of the best meals I've ever had. We were there for our 4 year anniversary and the staff made it an unforgettable experience. Everything couldn't have been better. Great appetizers, dinner was perfect, and the raspberry soufflé was to die for. Great views of the Bellagio water show.
