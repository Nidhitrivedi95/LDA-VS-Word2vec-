LdD0yYLcHuamULrvZYY3Jg We found this place on yelp as it's just a couple of blocks from our AirBnb and were able to get a last minute reservation for Monday night. It's a very cute little spot with seating both in what appears to be the living room of the house and in a teeny covered courtyard in the back complete with heaters (though we did not need them at all on a July night). There are two menu options - a "petite table" that comes with a soup or salad with your main and the "table gourmande" for $12 more which also includes an appetizer and dessert. I ordered the gourmande and my husband took the petite and we split the extras. The bread basket came with both butter and a really good chicken liver pate. My husband had the sweet potato soup which he enjoyed, and I got the salad which was a bit on the bland side, just mesclun and vinaigrette.

For our appetizer, we chose the goat cheese profiteroles which came out piping hot, along with a beet mousse that was surprisingly tasty. The profiteroles were good but not particularly memorable. Our mains, on the other hand, were amazing. I ordered the night veal filet with sweetbreads which was on special that night. I'd tried sweetbreads once before and didn't see what the hype was about but these were tender and delicious, as was the veal. Probably the best veal I've ever eaten in my life. It was cooked perfectly, as was my husband's fish dish. The tarte tatin dessert was a little disappointing - more of an open apple pie than the french classic - but still delicious.

The service was impeccable and best of all, it's BYOB. A very reasonably priced, excellent meal. I'd go back again for sure.
