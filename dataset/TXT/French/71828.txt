XgkTmVrlHHO5g96AfOAfpw Food was better than expected. Wine as well. Went for a Bordeaux. 
They wheel out a variety of cheeses for you to choose from; very nice. 
I had pork tenderloin, wife had New York strip steak. 
Parmesan frittes are frittes done right. 
Big frittes guy. 
Had to try the poutine as well. Stellar poutine. 
Would return. Good stuff.
