KbBMhk_G57WQ2M_9srNbCQ Dined here recently with a group of rowdy anglo friends and had no problem with the service, very friendly if a little absent minded. The food I ordered was delicious - the math of the Table D'Hote didn't seem to add up for me so I went for an entree and app. The squash soup with deep fried breaded escargot and roast garlic on toast had me moaning and eye rolling and refusing to share. The tartar with the crispy fried herbs and caviar was meal-sized and amazingly delicious. Not West Coast fresh, but for Montreal, really lovely. 

The decor is chic, maybe odd for the neighborhood, but not ostentatious, and definitely comfortable and romantic.
