COgwFthJpS4We16W5Gf4lw Just celebrated another anniversary with dinner here. It was wonderful, as usual. Enjoyed the pre- fixe menu.  Food was delicious, served by friendly staff. I had salmon and my husband had beef medallions. Sheer perfection!  Best French bread in Las Vegas.  We thought we finished with soufflés but they brought a sorbet with a candle in it as an anniversary surprise!

Dinner here is a leisurely event. Savor every moment of it!
