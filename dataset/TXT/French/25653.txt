When my friends and I got to The Hotel we were instantly impressed with how classy this place was and how beautifully decorated with the most amazing, freshest smelling flowers as you step in.  We finally sat down for dinner and noticed how poor the service was, especially for a fine establishment that has won numerous Michelin awards.  I ordered the halibut with foie gras, I've had better.  My friend ordered the NY strip, it was good but again we've had better.  My other friend ordered I think the cod or sea bass, can't remember and she said it was ok.   All in all the food was mediocre.  The views are amazing and the lounge next door was fun.

Ate at Aureole a few nights later and thought the meal I had there was the best in Vegas, I'll definitely go back there for the same price I paid at Mix.
