This place is fantastic. More authentic than this just in France. George is a great server, very strong French accent but great on service too! Makes you feel like you are indeed in France. 

Food is absolutely fantastic. I only had a Duck this good in Paris so you can't ask for more.

This restaurant is inexpensive for what you get. This is a must go in Cleveland.
