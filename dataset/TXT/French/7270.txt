4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I've eaten here twice and both times were good. Not fantastic though, which makes me think I need to return for the steak frites! The patio is definitely one of the best on the strip. It has some shaded areas but can still get extremely hot.. my butter melted completely just from sitting in the sun! Great people watching.. it's too bad you can't request to be seated there when you make a reservation. I think my favorite item that I've tried is the chicken crepe. The bread and butter is very good.. the little bag makes it feel like a true french baguette!
