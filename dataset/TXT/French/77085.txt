yU3p0tEBtGuZLTcsBHw9uQ This restaurant is amazing! We visited on Sunday around 10:30AM and waited on line, the host came around to take names and about 30-45 minutes later we were seated. The wait was totally worth it because the food is incredible. I ordered the foie gras poached eggs and my husband ordered the duck confit poached eggs - both were served with sides of fruit and a shot of strawberry rhubarb smoothie. We split a side of apple doughnuts sprinkled with powdered sugar served with dipping sauces. Everything was absolutely delicious and the service was great. This was our last stop on our Montreal trip and I wish we knew about it sooner because I would have definitely come for brunch more than once.
