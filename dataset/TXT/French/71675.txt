XcWlBj5oQgzKhR7Cxovj3w If you have enough time to sit down at a full service restaurant while on your layover in Phoenix and aren't looking for a cheap and quick place, stop in to Zinc Brasserie. The menu is a bit pricey, but hey you're in an airport, but you will find really yummy French food. I recommend the Ham and Gruyere Cheese sandwich on a baguette. Perfectly toasted and warm + the mustard on it... oh my! Yes so tasty. Makes traveling all the more comfortable. Am I going to France? No. But a nice mini break from traveling was lovely! And whatever sauce they serve with the fries- YES!
