Duck Hash
- tender, flavorful, buttery from all the duck lard.  the potatoes soaked up all the flavor so it was all delicious

the best part of the meal was the free bread! it is SO FRESH, it just melts away like a pillow of floury goodness in your mouth!  don't be shy! it doesn't even need butter to be amazing.

my friends who had salmon rillettes claimed that it was salty

overall, a great meal at a reasonable price with perfect portions.  I wouldn't mind coming back here if I was invited
