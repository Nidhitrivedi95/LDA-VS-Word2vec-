sphMzEIqY1I2Dzv3zLZY2g Global moved to Pineville last year an its just 5 minutes from my house I had not been but my neighbors said the food was n great service. Today I had the chance to go they arent open on sundays but my neighbors daughter got married an had her reception at Global. Its very nice inside an we just had appetizers but they were amazing . They served meatballs with a dipping sauce it sorta had a cheese flavor I could have ate a whole plate lol They served pulled pork sorta like a nacho very good drizzled with bbq sauce yum. They also served hummus on a tortilla chip. Im gonna make it a point to have dinner at Global an I recommend
 if  your looking for a reception location or any type of special event choose Global. The owners were great in helping with the cake cutting
