xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g This is one of my favorite places in Las Vegas.  I'm from New Orleans and know good food and service when I experience it.   This place meets expectations for both.  This trip was my third time to this restaurant and I would recommend it.  Wth the service and excellence we had for dinner on this last trip, I'll be back again.   Also, they have a wonderful soufflé!  Be sure not to miss it!
