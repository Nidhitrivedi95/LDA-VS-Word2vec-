rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w Full five stars based on each of food/drink, service and overall decor. You can go to the Bellagio's website and/or Trip Advisor to look at pictures of the food and the intimate decor overlooking the Fountains of Bellagio.  Taste, presentation and creativity are spot on but typical of any high end Vegas establishment. What separated our dining experience tonight was hands down, the down to earth staff. From the moment we were greeted by the hostess, every individual added some element of personality and flair to our overall experience. Special thank you to Martin for his story telling and attention to detail; we had a blast! I did not get the name of the lovely lady who presented us with even more of that delicious chocolate coffee bread upon our departure (very thoughtful), but kindly pass along this message to her if you can! Many thanks team Le Cirque! If we ever find our way back to Vegas, we will most certainly return as long as the same team is intact.
