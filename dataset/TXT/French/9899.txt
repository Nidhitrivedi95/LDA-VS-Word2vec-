4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I decided to make a Yelp Account just so I could write this review. I've been a long time reader and often used others suggestions and reviews to pick a destination restaurant. 

Yelp found us Mon Ami Gabi. 

The scenario: It was my mom's birthday. So we decided to celebrate in Vegas. Saw a show, gambled, hung out by the pool... the usual eat, drink be merry, etc! 

But for the birthday night dinner, the objective was not over the top expensive but still really good food/ambiance/service/overall experience was a must. And we found it here, in Paris (Vegas of course). 

The food: delicious! Oh and the wine was paired perfectly! Started with cheese and fruit (yum!) and warm olives (good and simple). Loved the bread too and the chardonnay carrots side! Main course: I had the fillet (with the recommended rouqefort), it was amazing! and my mom had the special fish of the day: chilean seabass with a corn that is beyond the concept of corn (so good).  And of course a little french pastry puff to finish for the birthday dessert. 
The ambiance: umm did we accidentally leave Vegas and wind up in Paris? :)
The service: Martin ... fabulously french, attentive, informative. 
The overall experience: 5 stars for sure. We loved it!! 

Side note: A lot of people recommended sitting outside (to see the fountains) but honestly we realized while it would have been great for bellagio fountain and people watching it is much more of a dining experience inside. Stand outside, watch the show before you go in. Then once inside let yourself be whisked away into a French feast fantasy. 

It will be si magnifique!
