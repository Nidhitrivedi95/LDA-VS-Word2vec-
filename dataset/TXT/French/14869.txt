5fquJHY2hMX9tPRD5s0t5g We went on a Thursday evening around 8 PM. Parking is a bit expensive around the area, but that might have been because there was a Hornets game that night. 
We were seated quickly. Their drinks are very strong, which is great since the average drink is $13. 
We started off with the calamari. It was fresh and crunchy; came with 2 sauces, both amazing.
Boyfriend had the hanger steak. It was delicious, my only gripe is how little is served.
I had the beef short ribs. Amazing and tender, I was able to cut into it easily with my fork. Portion was ok.
We shared 3 sides: mac and cheese (ooey gooey cheesiness), assorted mushrooms (I would drink the sauce it comes in if it weren't for the fact that I'd be looked at as an animal), and the fingerling potatoes (simple potato wedges). 
They special dessert they had that evening was a bread pudding with a vanilla créme. It was ridiculously decadent. I was in love with every bite.
Service was great. Server was friendly and attentive. 
I will definitely go back.
