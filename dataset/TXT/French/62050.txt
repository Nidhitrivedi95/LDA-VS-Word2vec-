SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ Had dinner here.  Food was excellent!  Appetizers - mussels and Korean ribs.  Entree - black bean "meat loaf".  I usually don't eat mussels since they can be chewy and tough but these were tender and spicy.  The ribs were also very tender and very spicy.  The "meatloaf" was excellent.  Restaurant setting was interesting - it was like having dinner in someone's backyard.
