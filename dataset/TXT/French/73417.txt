xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g Let me get things started that this restaurant is fairly expensive however, it is worth the dining experience.

You'll get a very nice view of the Bellagio Water show, a good portion of the Vegas strip. Do that while sipping your martini. 

Call ahead for reservations and I suggest you dress up when going to the Tower. Most if not all people are dressed nicely. If you'll spend a little, why not go the whole nine yards and dress up, even just for this place. It is worth your 120$/ person.
