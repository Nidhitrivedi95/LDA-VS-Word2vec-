zIyqiWYKrCvAdGeWXXBxFw First summerlicious of 2015 and it went off on a positive rapport! Veloute bistro is among one of the cute places I've been to in a while.  French inspired the layout of the place has a beautiful flow; with the small patio in front, leading into the open concept dining space, and down the stairs into the lovely backyard patio.  The ambiance is tres intimate, clean, classy and presentable.
The staff are very sweet, funny, and willing to share recommendations with their clientele. They've got their regulars, one of which is a cute friendly neighborhood cat that comes every so often and takes his/her seating spot beside the cat dish out in the backyard patio.
For Grub! 
starters I had their French onion soup, presentable, but most of all, decadently cheesy, and perfect balance of the onions and melody of other infused flavors. 4.5/5
Entree: their Filet Mignon 5/5 cooked to perfection, Medium rare topped off with a nice au-jus and peppercorn served on the side with some local greens. 
Dessert: Caramel flan, presentable, not overly sweet! 

overall! awesome place, and I shall be coming back to Queen street EAST.......WAY EAST...aka beaches.
