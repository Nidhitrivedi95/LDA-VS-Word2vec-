A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g It was early Sunday morning, after dropping our wild child (our pitbull terrier) at her day camp that we decided to make the drive to Patisserie Manon to taste the macarons for ourselves.  I had it bookmarked FOREVER.  Earl been wanting to go after hearing a retired pastry chef raved about how he would be a Patisserie Manon at least 3x a week.

When we arrived, we definitely felt like kids at an ice cream shop.  Ooh I want this, I want that, wait, let's look at everything first before making our decision. 

Our final orders were:
-Macarons: Caramel Sea Salt, Mango, Pistachio, Rose, Ginger.  I enjoyed all, though I haven't tried the ginger.  That one is Earl, and he hasn't eaten it yet.
-Pain au Chocolate: I like this very much.  I will order it again. 
-Cheese Crossaint w/hot dog: Earl though it's a cream cheese crossaint, but no, this was savory.  We didn't enjoy this at all.  Pass.
-Palmier:  Earl's choice.  It was crispy throughout.  Eh.  Nothing special.  Earl said that he was hoping that it will taste like the one at Babita's Coffee Shop in Long Beach.  It doesn't.
-Strawberry Crème Amare (?): It looks like their version of the strawberry shortcake but instead of shortcake, it was a crossaint or something similar.  I ate half of it today and it is still good.  I heart this one and will get it again and again.
-Meringue:  I just wanted to try...pass.

The young gentleman that helped us was super friendly and helpful.  

We will definitely come back.
