vg55SAkrEmuHpWfIMtJjBQ Went yesterday for After Graduation dinner. Our party of 6 sat down around 8pm feeling pretty hungry. Needless to say we reserved many months in advance. We had one waiter serving a large area, and he was pretty slow. It took 20min to get wine. A tiny basket of bread came 35min past. We realized the process will take hours but decided to go with the flow and ordered appetizers, which we got after 15 more minutes. The appetizers were great, especially the asparagus soup. We finished the appetizers in 5 min. It took 30 more minutes to get a tiny portion of Damon and a pretty tough stake. 
This is an overpriced place which in reality is nothing but average. Don't waste your $$$
