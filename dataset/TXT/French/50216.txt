ovtlrcsVRlgZZQUlHs_ovw The food, drinks and restaurant are great. I've been going there for the last 9-10 years during Spring Training and I wouldn't go anywhere else.
The appetizers, dinners and the great desserts are top notch. The bartender Heather is the best bartender. Her drinks are delicious and she is very personable and makes you feel very welcome. Hope their paying her top dollar because it's why I go there.
Make a reservation, I promise you won't be sorry!!!
