5Bp8rQlvD44_W2lkcCc2vw We were staying at Sofitel for one week and almost everyday we ate here... Derek, our server/waiter was awesome! So attentive, so educated ...the croissants and omelette in the morning were to die for! For lunch the onion soup was yummy! And at night they serve the drinks/cocktails with all sort of snacks as a compliments ;)
