rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Definitely hard to find I can tell you that - but once found you are emerged into a pleasant establishment.

We had a dinner party for six back in May and I called ahead if time to make sure we would have excellent outdoor seating since our reservations weren't until 9pm that night. The service was top-notch from the call in reservation which was done a week prior to the end when we walked out the restaurant. Definitely will stop by for brunch next time in town.
