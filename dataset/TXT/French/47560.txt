O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q This review is for brunch only.

So we woke up on a Saturday morning at The Palazzo and wanted to grab brunch. Since Morels was in our hotel, we decided to give it a chance. We sat outside in the shade since it wasn't hot yet and we had a good view of Las Vegas Blvd. 

Basically their menu has a lot of typical brunch items. I got eggs and smoke salmon crepe and it was really good. The portion was big. My friend got the stuffed french toast (with marscarpone cheese inside) and it was kinda small and kinda watery inside. Another friend ordered the pancakes and you get 5 in the order. 

The prices are kinda high but that's expected for a restaurant in The Palazzo. Honestly you can find a cheaper and better brunch than this place. The food was good but not worth the prices.
