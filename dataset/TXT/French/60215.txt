SBnpT6JDbah-5l_52GM5sw Just moved here from Miami via NYC. I've been to a lot of great restaurants and not so great. Sardine at least for a dinner unfortunately will not get high marks which is too bad because the service was so horrendous it "over-powered" the actually decent dishes. Wow talk about a disaster in service it really made me think my goodness if I had probably had a nirvana experience with a dish I would have to drag myself back here to bare the service to eat here again.
