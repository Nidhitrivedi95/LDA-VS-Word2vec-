9ET_RUNztevq4_OLAX80Gg Was so excited to finally eat here.   I've never had anything but a positive experience any other Boulud restaurant I've been to.   Also, how can you go wrong to eat at the main restaurant at the flagship location of the world's most consistent luxury brand?

C'est dommage.

What a letdown.    Unfortunately so.  

Sure, it's a lovely room with great service.  Delightfully informal while extremely attentive.   And sure, the wine list is great and the Sommalier is even better.   Suggesting a wonderful Nîmes  to match our palate and particular pricepoint.  

But the food...  Zut alors.  Ce n'est pas grande cuisine française.    

All six of our combined dishes were pedestrian at best.   Ranging from a somewhat decent lamb dish to completely terrible cavatelli.   Something that appeared to be undercooked and wallowing in a bowl full of tears of forgiveness. 

That's fine at a lesser establishment.   But you don't come here for hit and miss.   

I understand the anger M. Boulud must have felt when NYC's iconic Daniel lost a star last year,  but why did he take it out on the kind people in our fair village?

Vous ne devriez pas perdre votre temps et d'éviter ce restaurant piétonne.
