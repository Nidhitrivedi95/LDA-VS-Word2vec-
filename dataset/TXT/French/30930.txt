fyJAqmweGm8VXnpU4CWGNw Decided to check this place out last night on Thursday and it wasn't too busy. It was a pretty small and secluded place, which I enjoyed. You go in and pick a table and sit down and the server comes to greet you. Our server Willie was excellent. He was very knowledgable about what they had to offer and made great suggestions. We went with a meat and cheese platter, duck breast, and mussels. We also went and ordered 2 bottles of the white bubbly wine. It went perfect with our whole meal. They had many options of cheeses to choose from and also they have a whole wall of fridges of beer and wine to select from. You can also purchase any single beers for a six pack like at Total Wine. We had the creme brûlée and sangria cheesecake for dessert and both were delicious! The sangria cheesecake was probably my favorite!
