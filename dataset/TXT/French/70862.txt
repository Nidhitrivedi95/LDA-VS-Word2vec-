xBxDMEkFK5GBhiy-8gGE9w When: Friday night dinner, 9:00
Crowd:  BUSY. But bar does not get too overcroweded. Which is good because its a small bar.

Restaurant setting: Sleek, modern feel. Narrow restaurant with a small bar in the front.  Great outdoor seating. Really, not built for large groups as most tables are 2 or 4 tops.  We had a group of 8, and where placed in the very front window, just near the front door and before the bar. Not a highly desirable location.

Menu: Some very intriguing items on the menu.  Range from pates, fish, and beef.  The chef recommended the special ribeye for 2 or 3. It was pricey at $75, however if split among 3 its reasonable and MUCH more delicious than the basic flank steak on the menu.  The 1 kilo of ribeye, came with some mixed green (salad) two cups of frites, and a very good bernaise.  It was AWESOME! Also, not to be forgotten was the vegetable of the day. Corn on the Cob from Quebec. May be the best corn on the cob I've ever had.

Enjoyed - The Ribeye for Two (or three) and the Corn Especially!  Others at the table had the Steak Frites (Flank Steak) and enjoyed it, just not as much as the Ribeye.  

Other:  On the downside, service was very slow. It took almost 30 minutes to get our cocktails after we ordered them, and a very long time for the final bill.  Also, dang it was HOT in that restaurant. Waiter was very nice, however.

Nutshell:  Very good restaurant. Pricey though. Might suggest a week night and outdoor seating over a busy weekend.
