s-zwyD8YOm-y3AbRrsRx7w We ended up coming here for dinner on New Year's Eve after searching for something unique and happening to stumble upon it. I have to say that the staff were amazing and the place is beautiful. The atmosphere set is very nice with beautiful decor and dim lighting. It really does look like how I would imagine a Swiss chalet (though what do I know?) 

The staff were incredibly attentive. It's the type of place where you have someone to greet you at the door and take your coat. At one point, my date dropped his napkin on the floor. A server noticed this and brought a new one to replace it within seconds. One interesting thing is that we didn't seem to have one server and it seemed like they served tables as an ensemble. However, there was never any confusion and so whatever their method is, they have it very well organized.

Now on to the meal... Meh. It's so sad because after all of this, I was really expecting greatness. I ordered from the table d'hote menu and so had 3 courses. The escargot were quite good. For my entree, I decided to go with something Swiss-seeming and so chose the "Züri Gschnätzlets" (which is veal with a mushroom sauce). I was not a fan. It came with the veal cut up into bits which I did not expect and it seemed like it was boiled. The sauce was kind of bland. It was also served with carrots which were quite good and hashbrowns which almost seemed like breakfast hashbrowns. 

Being that I clearly didn't enjoy the main part of my meal, I'm tempted to give this place 3 stars but the appetizer, dessert (I had the apple strudel), charming decor, and impeccably friendly service mean I'd definitely be willing to try Alpenhaus again next time I'm in Montreal. I knew I should've gotten the fondue!
