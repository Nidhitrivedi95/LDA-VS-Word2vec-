33Tr0eRki1Yamzleu4GMdw Fantastic venue in southeast Vegas. Large dining area with fantastic baked goods and lunch and breakfast offerings.  They serve coffee, beer, wine, and a quaint menu. They also have bottomless mimosas apparently everyday which is an awesome addition to any French bistro. No outdoor seating area but plenty of comfort and space indoors. 

I came early one morning to fuel up and was immediately greeted and served by friendly staff working diligently to sculpt fresh bread and cook up tasty pastries. I ordered a croissant and coffee but really wish I paleo ordered a sandwich to go as they looked fantastic. Not to mention the free samples of almond croissants at the counter which I would never say no to.

Prices are typical for quality but still won't set you over $10 to get full and fulfilled. Rosalie's is a top notch French bakery. A must if you're craving freshness and you're in the area.
