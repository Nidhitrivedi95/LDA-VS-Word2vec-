kIW8IeTV3W1tS_q_WAU4wQ woot.  amazing food...  Highly recommend the beet salad.  

Montreal's pretty people go here for dinner but I was able to sneak in for some reason. The food is excellent.  Some of the best I have ever had.  Been here 3-4 times and tried bunch of different thing and each time I am surprised on how well they make it.

Great wine list too.  Who else in Montreal carries Au Bin Clemant from CA???
