Dim, romantic setting, heavy linens and silverware, polite and prompt service. I gave it "spendy" with three $$$ because everything I REALLY wanted to eat there was in that category - you could get away with less, but once you've sat down with their warm baguette and a glass of wine, you won't want to. 

The escargots were terrific but one was very sandy/gritty, I was concerned about my teeth. Excellent hangar steak and of course the steak frites were amazing. With so much variety in Vegas, it's tempting to move on to another restaurant and another and another, but this one is definitely a keeper, will go again next time we're in town, regardless of the other temptations. Not sure if you consider this dressy or casual, both would apply here - you do need a shirt with sleeves, no wifebeaters. But golf shirts and shorts are fine. 4 stars for service, ambiance and the dinner I had, wish I could tell you folks about more of the food there but will review it again next time I'm in Vegas.
