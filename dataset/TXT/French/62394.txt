SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ The peanut butter injected choco molten lava cake was the best. 2nd was the mousse and 3rd the bread pudding (not that they were that great). I can't really remember the food but I do remember a cat and a pretty garden setting. Atmosphere is nice, the server was great but nothing amazing about the expensive food.
