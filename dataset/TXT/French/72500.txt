XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q I've been to a few other 3 michelin star restaurants, and this one is flat out the best.  The service was exceptional, everything was timed properly, and the food was a flavour explosion.  At the end of my Le Rubis desert, my mouth was going to explode with flavours like toucan sam, ok?!  I was quite amazed by everything from the bread cart to the desert cart.  The only thing that did not impress me was the use of paper towels in the bathroom.  I wanted to aim high on them and make them shrivel in order to teach them that they needed linens, but I felt that the food and service more than made up for it.
