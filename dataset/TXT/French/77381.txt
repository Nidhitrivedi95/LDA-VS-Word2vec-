Four Stars

Another Bar. Another Great Drink.  When I asked for a frozen drink, the bartender made me feel like a putz.  She was like we don't even have a blender.  My friend Matt then ordered the Liquid Nitrogen Caipirinha, which was frozen and amazing for $25.  The Process: 1. Mix the Drink 2. Put into a Stainless Steel Bowl 3. Add Liquid Nitrogen 4. Scrap it out and whip it into a smoothie consistency.  The Cherry Limeade tasted like a Sonic Cherry Limeade with some vodka.
