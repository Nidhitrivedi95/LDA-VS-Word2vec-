myJ6pgIhN42EQh2sAVXKoQ Let's start where I always start. Decor and service. The decor is pleasant -- it's neutral, modern and fresh. The server was friendly and checked in on me regularly. I ordered a classic burger with fries. First the burger -- not bad but not outstanding. The bun was fresh but average -- nothing special. Truly tasted like buns you would purchase from Loblaws. The patty was good but again not special. The fries looked liked and tasted like they had been sitting around a while. They were more like "bits" with no fry measuring more than half of an inch. I wouldn't order them again. There are a lot of condiment and add on choices. They have beer on tap. Wine and cocktails. I'll give it one more try [visited on a Monday] but I will need to see a bit more next time.
