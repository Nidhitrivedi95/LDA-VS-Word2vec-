Went there on a Sunday evening without reservations.  Was a little hesitant that we would get a table, but we got there early enough (~6 PM) that we managed to get one.  The windows were all open, so the restaurant had a very airy feel.

The wait staff was super nice and friendly!  Our waiter was informative to tell us what wine to pair with our food and explained the dishes quite well to us.  The other waitresses were quick to serve us bread and water.  Truly pleasant!

Even if the wait staff were not friendly, the food would still get me 5 stars.  We had a dry sherry to begin our meal.  I don't remember the name of the sherry, but it was nice and nutty.  Then we had a red burgundy to go with our entire meal as the waiter recommended it to us.  That was absolutely divine!  Very easy to drink that I could have had 3 glasses of that without any complaints!

We started with tarragon bison tongue (omg, my first time!) and oysters as appetizers.  Can't say I've had enough bison tongue to distinguish whether it's good or not, but it was tasty enough that I didn't gag upon eating it.  But I know my seafood, and the oysters were delicious!

We proceeded with our entrees: catch of the day (hake), plogue à champlain (potatoes, cheddar cheese, smoked bacon, maple syrup, seared foie gras, in a buckwheat flour crepe), and pied de cochon.  I absolutely loved the hake.  It was so fresh to eat!  The plogue was sweet, but that didn't bother me.  Au pied de cochon was fine (not a pig lover).  I'm normally not a fan of foie gras, but this place might actually make me like it.

Finally, for dessert, we had creme brulee and the panna cotta special.  Had better creme brulee as it was cold when we got it.  Panna cotta was light and easy to eat.

This was an expensive meal ($240 CSD for 3 people), but it was definitely a great dining experience.  I would go back again (well, when my wallet is a little bigger...).
