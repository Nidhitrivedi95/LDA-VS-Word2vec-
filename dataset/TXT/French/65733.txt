U8ou87Xc3MWiDnmGB3U6mg Probably the best French food I've ever had! My friend is friends with chef (unfortunately, he left sometime after I visited in July 2013) and already knew what to order. The rotisserie chicken was unbelievably tender and juicy, the beef literally melted in our mouths, and the mushroom risotto was surprisingly good considering I don't usually enjoy risottos. The menu is limited, but all the plates were great, so it didn't matter anyway. There wasn't much decor or ambiance, and the service was all right, but the food made up for it -- and I care more about the quality of food anyway. I'm not entirely sure how the restaurant is now since I'm from out of town and the chef I had left.
