c8j5MQqlb0RhgS_bpxMDuA Boris Bistro is simply amazing. The service is excellent, and the waitstaff are friendly, attentive and very knowledgeable about the menu. The outdoor terasse is beautiful, and a perfect place for a group dinner. The menu has good variety and everybody was very satisfied with their food, and the winning dish was the beef tartar. Desserts were quite good as well. And to top it all off, everything is very reasonably priced. Would definitely recommend getting a reservation to make sure you can sit outside!
