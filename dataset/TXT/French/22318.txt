BSmqxPbQglQwP2R56OqOag Went to local bistro for Easter brunch, and the food, and service were great from start to finish. They have a diverse brunch menu and my group enjoyed eggs benedict, pizza, and the hamburger. The ingredients on everything tasted fresh, and everyone walked away satisfied from the meal. They have a bottomless mimosa deal during brunch, and our waitress kept them flowing and plentiful, which was extremely appreciated. There were even little details like allowing us to pick which citrus fruit we wanted in our water. This restaurant clearly cares about their customers, and the quality of their food. I will be back when I'm in the area.
