bEVWHtBRYVwqaaNF4mWNYg The atmosphere here is great.  I like it a lot in the winter as there is a thick cover around the door so that cold air cannot get into the restaurant so easily.  Once you enter the restaurant, you feel cozy and warm. We sit in the inner quarter.  

The Escargots has the right amount of cheese in garlic butter.  It is so rich.  The Crevettes et Coquilles is a must try.  It has 3 seared jumbo shrimp and 3 Diver 
 scallops served over a puff pastry tart filled with mushrooms, cream and shallots, topped with crispy leeks.  The puff pastry is crispy fresh.  The shrimp and scallops are almost cooked to their perfection.  Our party are all seafood lovers and all ordered almost the same dishes.  

The restaurant is full. As it is along Yonge Street, the parking is not easy.  The service is good in a sense the server is far away but reachable.  If you want something different to try, here it is another restaurant.
