xCcLCK1Fho4oyRmPqU05NA Located where Peckhams used to be, Henri is a French deli and cafe in Stockbridge, perfectly located for a stop during some charity shop shopping or after a wander in the Botanics and Inverleith Park, or even after a browse around the Modern Art Galleries.
The coffee is very good, and I had only gone for coffee until recently. But after a wander up the Galleries the other day we had cheeky stop for coffee and got tempted by a platter of charcuterie and cheese.  We ordered a small size one, which was plenty for 2 for a late afternoon snack.  Different kinds of yummy cheese, and some saucisson, and ham, accompanied by a couple of olives and cornichons. Gorgeous!
The deli counter has an extensive selection of French cheese, and if you like your smelly cheese, it is the place to go!
They do bread and viennoiseries, which I hear are good.
The shop also has an selection of French delicacies, from nougat to cassoulet. They also sell wines and other alcoholic drinks, which are a bit overpriced, but can be nice as a present.
Being French myself, I find the shop expensive, but it is fabulous to make presents to a foodie friend or as a little occasional treat.  The cafe is however reasonably priced and the staff are very friendly.  I can only recommend the place.
