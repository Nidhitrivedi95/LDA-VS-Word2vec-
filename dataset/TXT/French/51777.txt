Their cocktails are good. Most of them are light and refreshing for the summer. It is a deal compared to the regular $14. I had the Moscow Mule and the And A Twist. The former was my favorite. The latter had too much residual sweetness to it. Both are light and scream quintessential summer drinks. 

I only ordered the sliders while we wait for the rest of our party. They were much better than I had expected. Two mini burgers topped with caramelized onions and blue cheese on a a buttered brioche bun with a side of fries run $8 right now. They were the perfect bar snack.
