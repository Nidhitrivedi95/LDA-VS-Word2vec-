in3zjiaLpNzr9G3K35gAJQ Great French cooking.  The bistro shares a kitchen with Vincent's fine dining side.  They offer a small standard menu and several seasonal dishes along with a pre-fix menu at a very reasonable price.  

The staff has always been friendly and willing to guide you through the menu and or the wine list.

The space is tight but that is part of its charm.  This is a great place for a date night or dinner with friends.  

Vincent is a superb chef and Phoenix has been blessed to have him put down roots here.  The bistro is a great addition.
