yVNaMEBUslR_7GbFhurJEg We went as a foursome to this restaurant in early October and were wowed by the gorgeous setting. Would make a fabulous date-night restaurant. 

Service was excellent: neither too much service to interrupt our conversation, nor did we struggle to get our servers' attention. 

A small menu and food was amazing in terms of presentation, and taste. Portions were on the small side but still in the $20-range; a good value. I had the octopus which was decidedly small but in a rich sauce that definitely satisfied. Desserts were also small but packed with flavour. We had the chocolate combination that was enough for two (folks with admittedly smaller appetites) as it was so delectable. 

We definitely look forward to our next visit and have recommended to our friends!
