SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ Had lunch today with a group.  Outdoor eating atmosphere was wonderful.  Two women had the chorizo breakfast burrito and loved it. One other had the French dip and she thoroughly enjoyed it. The turkey club sandwich was also great.  Two women had the chicken sharwarma salad. It was the only item ordered that both did not like. The spices on the chicken breast  did not blend with the salad dressing.  We did have a problem with bees around the table. Over all, we would return.
