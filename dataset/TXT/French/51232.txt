P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ I wish I could review the food, however I can only review the customer service. My husband and I traveled from the east coast to renew our vows for our 10th anniversary. After months of research on line I finally decided on Guy Savoy for our after the ceremony dinner. Made reservations 3 months in advance, confirmation number received, all is good. The night we were to dine there we are standing outside of the restaurant (in black tie apparel!) looking at a sign that says it is closed until the end of July!!! I call the reservation number and they try to tell me they left a message. Um, no, I don't think I would forget such a message. The agent insisted someone else must have received it. No, again, it's my personal cell phone number, to which no one else has the code for. She curtly apologizes and offers us a $75 credit at another restaurant. Laughable, if I wasn't so close to tears. We will never return to this establishment and I will warn away as many people as possible.
