4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw One of my favorite lunch/brunch places when coming to Las Vegas.

I ALWAYS order the Filet Mignon! It's so delicious and definitely affordable here. Literally heaven in my mouth. The filet mignon is always so flavorful, and always comes out in a very large peice too. Normally when I go to steak houses the filet mignon is extremely tiny. Service is absolutely fantastic, I also reccomend sitting in the patio.

Definitely one of my favorite stops in Las Vegas, definitely returning during my next trip.
