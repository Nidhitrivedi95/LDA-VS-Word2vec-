fyJAqmweGm8VXnpU4CWGNw I picked up some desserts at this place to take home to sample and share with my husband.  I really enjoyed the pear almond tart and the cherry almond clafoutis.  We also tried a couple of macarons.  I found the center to be to "creamy."  I prefer the centers to be more of a chewy consistency.  Most of the other little places I have been to where I enjoy them make them this way.  The dinner menu looks good and I am interested in trying their moules next time I stop in.  I think this is a great place to share some wine, bread, and a dessert during the day.  I can't speak for the dinner yet, but I am looking forward to trying it out.
