O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q Let's make it clear, I'm a fan of foie gras and I'm a hater on those who banned it in California. Therefore, on my recent trip to Vegas, I knew I HAD to get my foie gras fix. I looked up a few restaurants to see who had a seared foie gras on their menu, and I was happily surprised that Morels had it, especially since we were staying at Palazzo. How convenient! I called the restaurant on Thursday to make sure they will have foie gras on Friday and they said yes.

We didn't get in to Vegas 'til really late Friday night, our dinner reservation was at 9:30pm. The moment I sat down and saw the seared foie gras on their menu, I knew I was in for a treat. To my dismay, when I was ready to order, our waiter informs me that they were out! Really?! You're out of foie gras??? He says that they sell so much on a daily basis, especially to Californians. Uh, hello?! That's me!! He went back to the kitchen and confirmed that they were out 'til Monday! Seriously?! The chef did NOT plan the menu accordingly. How can you run out of such a 'hot' item, especially right before a busy weekend? I couldn't believe it. My 4.5hr drive was a waste. My weekend was already off to a bad start. I was devastated. 

If I had known they had such a limited supply, I would have dined elsewhere.
