H4N3wGaSJsy8hrNDtADmug A delicious BYO classic in the Village, cozy, friendly, not-fancy but warmly lit and nice enough for a casual date. I can't say too much about the food, only that I went with the heavily recommended Poutine Galvaude - poutine with freshly roasted chicken and peas and gravy and cheese curds. It was the perfect cosy Quebec meal. The gravy was tasty, the fries were thick cut and fresh, and the whole thing went perfectly with the cans of Belle Geulle I brought from the dep. My friend had the Hot Chicken Sandwich, another classic, and he seemed deeply happy with his life choices. The menu is thick so I think there's lots of other good ways to go here. 

I loved the waiter and the feeling of welcome and comfort, I will be back often.
