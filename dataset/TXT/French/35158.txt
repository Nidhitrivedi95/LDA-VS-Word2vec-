Quick hits- 
Heirloom salad is amazing. 
The Frittes

Stumbles- 
Steak that came out blue instead of medium rare
The perfectly roasted chicken that was a bit dry. 

The food felt like one of two things, the chef wasn't there or they stopped caring.

The staff however was very cool. That being said the bar is the standout of this place. 

Unless I wasn't paying, I won't be back for food, just drinks.
