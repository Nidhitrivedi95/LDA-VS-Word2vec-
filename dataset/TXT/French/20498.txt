AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw I was in Vegas this past weekend for my best friend's bachelorette party. One of her requests was to eat here for breakfast/brunch during our stay. I'm so glad she suggested it because the food was AMAAAAAZZZIIINNNGGGG!!! 

I ordered the lobster eggs benedict with potato waffles. OH. MY. WORD. THE absolute best eggs beni I've ever had in my life. EVER. My mouth waters every time I think about it. I will be dreaming of the day I can have it again. Sigh.

The restaurant is a little snug, but we walked in and were seated within 15 minutes or so. And the aroma in the restaurant is heavenly-- fresh waffles, crepes, and other yummy goodies galore. 

I'll definitely make it a point to come here again the next time I go to Vegas!
