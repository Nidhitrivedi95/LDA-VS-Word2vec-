Da6eZFThE9xanUAGNpZxAg WOW!  I have never had maple soy glazed pork ribs that were so tender and delicious before!  They were seriously jaw-droppingly delicious!  It was so tender that Sindy could literally pulled off the meat from the rib bone for two of the pork ribs and did so.  It was perfectly done!  The smoked macaroni and cheese actually didn't taste too smokey to me, but it was a really well done combination of food for one dish.  I loved this! :)
