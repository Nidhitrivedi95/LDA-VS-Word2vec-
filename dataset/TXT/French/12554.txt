Well when we came to Vegas last week we had a fabulous lunch and terrific service from Stephane, who has a French accent that is REAL! She helped us with menu choices and was so warm and welcoming. We even got a hug upon leaving. The Chicken Brie sandwich is delicious, as was the seafood crepe and skate wing. Ask for your fries well done and they are superb. Great atmosphere and on our next trip to Vegas, we will visit our new French friend Stephanie! Well done.
