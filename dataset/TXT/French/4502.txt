2gUbgbdJ7IFSbicBXlSchw Like a few other Yelpers, I was disappointed with L'Express, after all the hype it had received.

The first thing that struck me about L'Express was how unfriendly the establishment appeared.  The Maître d' appeared almost annoyed with us when we arrived and requested our reservation.  Without so much as a word, he left us standing in the reception for 25 minutes while he seated several parties who arrived after us.

Likewise our waiter was a man of few words and remained cold and detached from our entire dining process.  The only time he spoke during our interaction was in a harsh, condescending tone when we requesting a recommendation pairing wines.

The food itself was relatively unspectacular, neither very good nor very bad.  We had a goat cheese salad, mushroom soup, quail and lobster risotto.    I can't complain, but with all the great dining options in Montreal, I don't see any reason to come here again.
