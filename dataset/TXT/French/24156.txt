cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg It is disappointing when a restaurant with such notoriety coasts off of their reputation. This is what we found here. It is true, the food is good, well-executed, and original. A failed lobster "sundae" notwithstanding we found all the dishes to be exactly what we expected. The problem was the service; it was a mess. Even after waiting an hour to be seated for our reservation (which is totally unacceptable) we were in the mood to forgive. Unfortunately the wait continued for another 30 minutes while the staff stumbled to properly set our table, take our order, and bring out our first course. By this time it wouldn't have mattered if Martin Picard himself was preparing our meal tableside, we were tired and hungry and no longer in the mood for the bungling service. Moreover, other botched details of the service, too numerous to mention, indicated lazy management and poorly trained staff (at one point I had 3 forks!). Overall, we just didn't have a good time and felt like we had wasted our time and money and there is no excuse for that.
