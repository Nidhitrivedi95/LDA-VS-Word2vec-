Great way to start our weekend!  Even though it was freezing outside (~40 degrees), we were able to sit on the semi-open 65th floor patio by the heat lamps and feel nice and toasty.  Amazing views of the strip, the best of any other penthouse bars we visited.

The drinks were pricey but it's Vegas.  My lychee martini was quite good.  The best part was that we were able to sit in the "reserved" seats without ordering bottle service.  That's a big plus in my book.
