YVYHX7RCPjCBqEth2CS91Q Went here on a Monday night to use a groupon before expiring.  A friend and I sat at the end of the bar since we were going to be sharing dishes.  Poor choice. Seemed like the kitchen was smoking us out for most of the night. 

For starters we had the beef tartare.  It was okay, not the best I've ever had, but not terrible.  What I was most looking forward at a French place is the bread. I was sorely disappointed! Instead of delicious, warmth wrapped in crusty yumminess, we got what tasted like week old bread.  We then shared an artichoke salad and mussels. Salad was, again, just okay. However,  the mussels were outstanding! They are likely the reason I may return in the future.

Bottom line: good wine, great mussels, the rest is forgettable.
