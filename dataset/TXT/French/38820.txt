jLxeBgWhLRbII2ACkgH1Sg Just moved back home and longing for a French cafe with beautiful buttery pastries, strong coffee, and luscious crepes. I fell in love and almost fell over as soon as I walked through the door. House made pastries adorn the cases and baskets, the smell of freshly baked bread assailing my senses, and a bright patch of sun in which to sit. For what more could I ask?!  This place is a gem and I will be back maybe on a daily basis.  I mean... "Pistachio roll, hazelnut brioche, and chocolate almond croissant s'il vous plaît!"
