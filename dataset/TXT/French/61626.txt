SJo_IjvzdRtCvZVN0cbrRQ We came here for Sunday brunch. Local, small place so usually a wait. We waited about 15 minutes. Well worth it!!  Delicious entrees with a menu that changes often. High class dining experience in a hidden gem. We had all of the specials and all were excellent. Especially loved the bacon. Farm fresh, organic specialty items. Nice looking bakery items in display case.  You will need to be patient for your entrees - they take a bit to put together. Something to consider if you bring hungry kids. Quick, friendly service.  I look forward to eating here again.
