Went with the whole family, so many age groups and had a wonderful time. Without a reservation we got a table quickly and had wine in hand in the blink of an eye. We had all the apps, and certainly the trout tartare did stand out, as did the pork belly. But it was the lamb that made my night so complete. Succulent and fresh, a real treat. We all had a wonderful time and return often.
