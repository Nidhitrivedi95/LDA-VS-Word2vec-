m4PW-GMc8JOU5nmMYncu-Q Excellent cocktail bar in the Plateau area. Highly recommend stopping here before or after dinner for some lovely drinks. There is an excellent Happy Hour menu featuring $8 cocktails. All are well-balanced. There are two scenes here: early and late. Early on it's quiet and will remind you of a turn-of-the-century parlor. Prohibition-style, of course. You'll be able to sit at the bar and enjoy the repose of a strong cocktail without the buzz of the city weighing you down. Late night, forget the repose. It's loud, it's raucous, it's crowded. Fight your way to the bar and get some shots in addition to the cocktail. Loud music, lots of noise. Both scenes have their appeal and their downsides - it all depends what suits your mood. Rest assured, you won't be disappointed by the cocktail menu. Most cocktails are priced around CAD $13-15. Wonderful variations on mint juleps. Salut!
