0d6kx6Jlocw77y1J9nbqMA 3.5. We came here after hearing the raves from a friend. The place is indeed hard to find, squeezed in the Fry's strip mall, and next to Subway. The deco is simple but cute, and the staff is attentive.
I ordered Spinach and Goat Cheese quiche, my friend got Mushroom quiche. I have to agree with most yelpers on the salad. Their salad with vinaigrette is delish, and the quiches are pretty good size. Frankly I have had better quiches, but these are not bad at all.
The dessert selection is huge, took us 15 minutes to decide which one. I was contemplating between the dark chocolate and "New Dessert" (peach and caramel), but ended up with the latter just to try something new. My friend got the "Hulk". I didn't care for the Hulk, a bit too sweet. The peach one was ok. Next time I'll DEFINITELY get the dark chocolate one. 
Overall, it's a nice place for quick bite when I'm near old town. Will go back!
