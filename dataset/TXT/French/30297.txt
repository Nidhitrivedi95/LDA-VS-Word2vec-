FRuuIDOd21pTJHvEGIt1Gg Can't wait to go back to Montreal so I can spend another night at Holder.  Love the place.  Was a perfect night with perfect dish after dish.  Especially loved the Salmon tartare with yogourt and Mujjol caviar, great to chase with the Lobster ravioli, beurre blanc and truffle oil.
