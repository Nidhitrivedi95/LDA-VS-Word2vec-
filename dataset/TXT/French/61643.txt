SLD5QYRCOgP2UDscLyrcaw I always wonder how people go to places that only warrant 1 star reviews. Now I know. And let's say, BrianS and I took one for the team last night. We went to Lafayette Bistro so you won't have to.

The interior is quite nice and the server was funny and nice too. I just can't give the place more than 1 star because I don't want anyone wasting their time and money going to this place which serves such poor food.

Prices seemed reasonable, but yuck. I got a steak frites. The fries were undercooked and the steak just had this weird flavour. I couldn't discern what it was - BrianS thinks that and the "rack of lamb" he was served (horribly cut three pieces of lamb - Gordon Ramsay would have thrown someone out of the kitchen for that atrocity) were cooked on a dirty grill.
Gross? yes! gross. I tried it so you don't have to.

The location of this place has been a revolving door for restaurants for years (crepe place, Italian tapas...) and I think that will continue. Maybe we'll try the next restaurant that takes residence. We won't be back to Lafayette Bistro. We ate so little of the food that we were out less than an hour after sitting and went home and had snacks at home. Should have done that to start!
