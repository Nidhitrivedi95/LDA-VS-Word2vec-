kGOr_D-LNpgZ2M9N8TT4QQ I came across La Société searching for good steak tartare. The restaurant is very nice; they've done a great job of creating that French brasserie feel. We had steak tartare and foie gras as our appetizers. The foie gras was great. The size of the lump was nice, it was perfectly cooked and the accompanying flavours were just right. We both enjoyed the tartare which was well seasoned and had a raw quail egg.

Our main courses included short ribs and a cassoulet. The confit in the cassoulet was crisp and delicious, the pork belly and sausage both fine (hard to distinguish those much). The Cassoulet was lentil-based, not the traditional white bean. Still good, but not my favourite way to do cassoulet. The beef short ribs were fantastic. Very rich and filling. The reduction was thick and very flavourful.

We had a beet salad and fries as sides. Both were good. Dessert was the profitéroles. They were just OK -- I suppose if you really love profitéroles they may be better, but our waiter strongly recommended them.

Service was very good; no complaints there at all.

All in all, I would return. Just wish they had sweetbreads.
