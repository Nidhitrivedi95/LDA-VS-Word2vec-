rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Tucked away, almost hidden amongst the Venetian suites you will find Bouchon. What a beautiful french restaurant with great outdoor seating. We ate here for Sunday brunch and sipped our Bellinis while we ate french baguette with jelly and butter. The eggs benedict was delicious as well as the corn beef hash. My only concern with this restaurant is the service. Our waiter was not with it at all. We had to ask twice for a soda, it finally came when the meal arrived. There were four girls in our party and 2 of the meals came out and it took about 5 minutes for the other 2 to be delivered. When I am paying close to $30/plate I think the meals and sodas should come out on time and together. I don't know. It was a nice place and the food was good but in Vegas the food is good at so many places. Make your way to Mon Ami Gabbi if you are in need of a French cafe fix.
