aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw I found this Bouchon Bakery a little over a month ago when I searched the Venetian and finally found it by the entrance from the Boulevard near the pedestrian walkway to TI.  It's a small space but they pack a lot of goodness here.  I also found yet another Bouchon Bakery one floor above almost where you enter the hotel when you come over the pedestrian walkway.  Bouchon Bakery plus 2.  This will be more convenient for me when I want something from the bakery when I'am at the Palazzo.  It's not too much to go there from the Palazzo displays.

Today, I only bought one pain au chocolate.  It was excellent, my wife reported.  Silly me, did I think I was going to get to eat it?  I like to try different things from Bouchon Bakery.  I love their macarons but I can buy just as good at a bakery closer to home and their price is better than Bouchon's.

This place is always worth a stop if just to look and, yes, buy!
