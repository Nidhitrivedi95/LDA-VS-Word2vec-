4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I had one of the best French dinners here!
It was outstanding and we were really quite surprised at how wonderful the food was.

Escargot was buttery but not too greasy and had a parsley mixture which added to its unique flavor.

The bone in ribeye is a must u have to order it medium rare and it will melt in your mouth with the perfect combination of herbs for the rich beefy flavor.

The goat cheese in tomato sauce appetizer was magnificently seasoned as it burst in your mouth and filled your tastebuds with a tantalizing taste of balanced goat cheese and fresh tomatoes.
I'm returning!
