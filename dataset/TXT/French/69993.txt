wPF-aYk0RRA3oOOxVnbMTg We had such an amazing experience at Chez Sophie.

My partner and I got married (civil) on Saturday and had a small ceremony and then we all went to Chez Sophie for one of the best brunches. We made a reservation for 27 people and met with Sophie and Marco a few days prior and both were so accommodating and nice, giving great suggestions for menu. 
The prices are incredible for the food that you get, presentation and detail are of a top notch restaurant.
Long story short, every single person in our party was amazed with the food, service and decor.

Thank you for such a great experience on our special day! 

Highly recommended!!!!
