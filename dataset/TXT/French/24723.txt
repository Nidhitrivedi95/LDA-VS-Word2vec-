He also kept putting his hand on my shoulder which made me uncomfortable. His demeanor was degrading when we had questions.  I've seen other waiters half ass their jobs and do better. I'm shocked this is what I received for the price we paid. Now when I go out to eat I think the service I receive all of the time is phenomenal, but then I remember, no, I've just seen the worst service there is so anything looks great.
