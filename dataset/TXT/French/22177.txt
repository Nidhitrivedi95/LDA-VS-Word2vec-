BSmqxPbQglQwP2R56OqOag Went there for lunch, which was fabulous. Grilled cheese sandwich with house made tomato soup, Cesar salad that was nice. Lots of available tables, and they tried to sit us a table for two which are so SMALL, I don't know how two people could have drinks and a main course. We enjoyed the lunch that we went back for dinner. At dinner, the place is LOUD. We were told it would be 15- 30 minutes. While we waited, we saw 5 - 6 open tables, which we assumed were for reservation. When we were finally seated after 30 minutes there still 5 -6 open tables. Strange! Our dinner was very good.
