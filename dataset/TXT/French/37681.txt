jalA5zHW8ZfY3RSPG7oDxQ Amazing little BYOB restaurant tucked away near the BP on East Carson Street. I have been here multiple times with groups as large as 20 and they are so consistent, every time I leave wondering how soon I can come back. They do amazing appetizers, my favorites being the crostini with pork (I order mine without), Brie, spiced apple butter, and arugula, and the spinach and pecorino dip with marinated tomatoes and basil served pipping hot with steaming hot baguette...unbelievable. The spinach dip is so creamy, warm and delicious, it could be eaten by the spoonful. All their entrees are so fabulous.  Being as I'm a vegetarian I've had a select few entrees, but the rolled eggplant filled with fresh mozzarella, sundried tomatoes and a pester cream sauce is divine! Entrees are served with soup or salad. They have a light but delicious vegetarian mushroom soup loaded with wild mushrooms and a great homemade poppy seed dressing served with their house salads. I have never eaten one bad thing here. Love this restaurant and continuously recommend it to friends and family. Be aware it is cash only. Oh and the corkage fee is only $2 per person, can't beat that!
