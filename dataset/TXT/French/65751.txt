uB6gdgo8pL4baMgdc4vS3A Was here for the complimentary breakfast as we stayed at the Hotel. The waiter was always very polite and courteous. He also helped us with an embarrassing situation. We thought we needed the hotel access card to open the door and kept swiping it. He helped us out by....opening the door!!! OMG so sad lol

Anyhow, breakfast was always nice here. It was so beautiful and bright with the open windows. We got served with either coffee or your choice of orange or grapefruit? juice. There were scrambled eggs (eggs were plain but you can add your own salt/pepper), sausage, vegetables, lots of bread, salmon, ham, fruits, etc. My favourite were the croissants and DIY parfait station. I could eat here everyday for breakfast. It helped save on food on the trip as we ate so much for breakfast that we only needed dinner.
