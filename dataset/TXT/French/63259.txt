SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA Went again for the third time,  first time this year. ..and was so disappointed.  The meat was not flavored as well.  I ended up leaving behind half of my main course....apparently they have some new people in the kitchen : (
Dessert was on the house and that was beautiful,  the way I remembered things being previously but it did not quite make up for the main course
