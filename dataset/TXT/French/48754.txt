oJZNHz5UUVUgrZwVBVlpYw I LOVE this bar! It's more of a piano lounge but still a bar hence the name!

I always stop by here at least once during a Vegas trip for several reasons. One, it's very comfortable. Two, the cable car martini. Three, the caviar. Four, the cable car martini. Oops. I said the cable car martini twice. This is my favorite cocktail in the world, especially here! I usually manage to get two or three down. 

This time I had the Royal Ossetra caviar. Absolutely delicious and served perfectly with all of the standard accompaniments a fine caviar should have. Caviar is a very expensive habit and this place is no exception. I'm sure there is a hefty markup, but with the comfortable atmosphere, lovely music from the piano and great service, it's worth every penny. This is also a great bar to people watch from. I could have sat there all day but needed to hit the casino to try and make the money back I spent on the 30 grams of that awesome caviar! 

If you find yourself wandering the Bellagio and need a yummy cocktail, be sure to hit the Petrossian Bar for a cable car!  You won't be disappointed!

Enjoy!
