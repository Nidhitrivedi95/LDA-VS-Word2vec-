sphMzEIqY1I2Dzv3zLZY2g My boyfriend and I visited Global during Restaurant Week-and oh boy, were we delighted with the food and service!

Ah, how I love Restaurant Week-especially at a restaurant I've never tried before! Up front I was impressed with their offerings for the tailored menu, and we went HUNGRY.

I will tell you-they are all by themselves in the office park, tucked away in the back corner in their own little world. They have been in business for 7 years, so your GPS is probably right instead of wrong as it leads you away from civilization.

I ordered the:
*Ooo La La Shrimp-Shrimp flash fried (no batter!) and tossed in a DELICIOUSly complex papaya vinaigrette and served with micro greens. The four shrimp were quite large, and had a very subtle heat I thought, with very Indian/Asian flavors.
*Mouclade Fourasine Style-mussels, shrimp and clams served with a creamy curry fennel risotto and focaccia. I literally scraped my bowl clean with the bread and would have licked the plate if I thought I wouldn't be judged toooo harshly by diners close to me... SO TASTY! This was Indian meets Italian with this incredible dish.
*Mascarpone Strawberry Verrine-so light and fresh, layers of mascarpone and strawberries topped with coconut crunchy  

My boyfriend ordered the: 
*Spring Mix Salad with pork belly-little pork belly explosions in the lettuces, carmelized pecans, manchego cheese and apple vinaigrette. 
*Sea Bass-wilted greens, braised shallots, Sriracha, & cauliflower goat cheese sauce. The flavor factor was HUGE! The fish was cooked perfectly, so moist and flavorful, with a delicate flavor that married excellently with the cauliflower goat cheese sauce. I think he DID lick his plate. :-) French meets Asian, I wish I was having this for dinner tonight!
*Nougat Glace-served frozen, roasted hazelnuts, pecans & maple crème Anglaise (I almost licked his plate). BEAUTIFUL presentation, with a foot-long puffed pastry that looked almost like a quill stuck in the frozen cream.

They served complimentary bread with a fennel butter-which amazingly paired well with everything we ate, including the wine. They had a special Restaurant Week Wine Menu, with three $30/bottle wines to choose from .We had the Malbec, which went well with everything we ate.

The chef, Bernard, came out to meet us after we were finished. His wife greeted us when we came in initially. They were SO FRIENDLY and hospitable, we will definitely go back and enjoy some more of their menu selections! Highly recommended-this restaurant truly has "global" flair, beautiful presentation, cozy atmosphere. Can't wait to go back!
