X17gJz1zuPQescVK1lnQLA Innovative concept and a fun game - we all enjoyed it. Seemed to be quite reasonably priced, as well (but that would be dictated by how many you split that cost up with). Also bias because we rented a private room, which seemed like a much better idea than a non-private room simply from space that you get with it (again, opinion largely dependent upon size of group you're with). Tables/balls were less than well kept and perfectly constructed though, so a fix in that regard would improve the experience. All in all, a good time doing something different for a reasonable price (and I could see us doing it again).
