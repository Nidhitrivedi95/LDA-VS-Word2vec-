XcWlBj5oQgzKhR7Cxovj3w Review based on the food only******

Don't come here for the anticipated service and fine dinning atmosphere. Come here for the fine wines, cold beer and the red wine braised pork belly. It's simply amazing. Don't be tempted to order anything else but a nice glass of wine and the pork belly. The pork belly here is some of the best I have had. You wouldn't expect this type of food in the middle of an airport in phx. I have many choices were I can spend my money but when I am stuck in the phx airport I choose to spend it here. Simply awesome.
