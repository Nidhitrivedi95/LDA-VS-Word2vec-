rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Yay, finally got to try Thomas Keller's restaurant.

We came for brunch and had a delicious time!  MMM....

Best part of my meal:  raspberry jam filled beignets!!  DELICIOUS!!  This was a special but I'm sure they offer it on their regular breakfast pastry menu (house made beignets with jam, for $7.00).

I ordered the Breakfast Americaine (go figure...in a french bistro).  $22.  Comes with eggs any style, bacon, sausage, pastry of choice (get the beignets), brioche toast, orange juice, and coffee.  The orange juice was delicious!  It was so sweet and smooth - no pulp.  One of the best orange juices I've had.  Coffee was a little room temperature so I was a little disappointed.  I like it hot!  and one of the waitress/2nd waitress wasn't overly friendly.  It seemed like she was training to be a waitress and forgot some of the specials/orders.

My friends also ordered the waffles and they liked it.  They also loved the beignets.

They give you complimentary french baguettes that they place on the table (no basket).  Eat it right away with the butter and jam.  Otherwise, it gets really hard pretty quickly.

Service:  our waiter was nice.  He was attentive and friendly.  The other girl was ok but not super friendly.

Ambience:  like fine dining...but for brunch (less formal)

Price:  They're not too bad for "fine dining" type of restaurants.  They tend to be a little bit more expensive than other restaurants.  But with better food!

Can't wait to come back again for their beignets.
