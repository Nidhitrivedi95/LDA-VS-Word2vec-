Get here early or you will miss out on the best quiche ever! My favorite quiche is the roasted vegetable. The crust and everything else in it just flows. For desert, I love the mixed berry tart. The crust is made with almond flour and it taste divine!

If you love croissants like I do, you'll have to try one plain then get an omelet with whatever turkey, bacon or mushroom. Whatever you choose you will not be disappointed. 

This place is a hidden gem and its well worth your time to drive out of your way to eat here.
