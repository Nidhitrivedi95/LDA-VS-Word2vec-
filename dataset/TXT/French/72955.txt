XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q This was a great experience. Many of the dishes served in Joel's restaurant are an accumulation of his his best work threw out his currier. I chose the 16 course menu with the wine pairing and my wife chose the 6 course menu.  The timing of the meals coming out of the kitchen were perfect!! Not an easy task as we were not Eating the same food and I was getting about two dishes to every one dish my wife was. The food was prepared properly and the presentation was quite refined, something you would expect from dishes that he took from years of experience, but most of them lacked that wow factor in flavor. The best part of the meal was his great selection of breads and the dessert cart was amazing. My brother has been certified as a master in baking for ten years and is one of the best bakers in the world and the breads and dessert served at this restaurant are of an equal quality of some of his work.  The service was exactly what you should expect from a three Michelin restaurant. I scanned the dining room and it was clear that they had scattered the reservations and the seating of their guests so that there was no one seated near anyone else allowing for privacy and a feel of exclusivity.  Overall this restaurant is well worth it's three michelin stars!!
