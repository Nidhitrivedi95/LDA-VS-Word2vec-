4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I did not have what the server indicated they are famous for, which is the steak. I had a salad which was supposed to be kale but was actually spinach on top of a poorly seasoned and very tough chicken breast for an exorbitant price. I also had the zucchini gazpacho which was good but cost far more than the value warranted. I suppose you pay for the ambiance if sitting outdoors beside the strip qualifies. I doubt I will ever return and would not recommend it to anyone.
