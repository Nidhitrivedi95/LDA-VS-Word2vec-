jLxeBgWhLRbII2ACkgH1Sg It took us 5 days to finish the box of pastries we picked out :P  Hey now don't get on my case!  We're talking about quality pastries - can't waste my employment earnings geez.  You've heard of coffee dunkers.  If you forgot, now you've been reminded... Plus these pastries are still good 30 seconds in the microwave.  Yeah not kidding!

It looks like a lot of the rolls here are made from croissant dough.  I was observing the flakiness of the exterior, but the inside was seriously like a soft croissant.  I enjoyed these carbs!  My favorite is the pistachio roll.  I thought it might be the hazelnut or chocolate; hmmm surprised myself.  Get some if you haven't tried the pistachio roll yet.  Oh and with a cup of cafe too!

Gotta come back though.  They have quiche.  Wanna know why I like quiche?  Cuz it's a meal in one.  I told you I like food that has everything already mixed in; simplified - not lazy food, just easier to eat.  Right so I'm coming back for more quality carbs :P

What was shockingly awkward in a cute weird way was when the man asked if I would like anything else when I was trying to pay, he said "I love you".  Slow awkward grin and sideways eyes reaction.  Are French men like that too?  I thought it was just Italian.  Okay thaaaaanks :)  I'll just take my box of pastries and go... Cya' next time for the quiche.  Au Revoir :)
