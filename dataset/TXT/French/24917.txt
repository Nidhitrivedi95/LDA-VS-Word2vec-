COgwFthJpS4We16W5Gf4lw We discovered this excellent restaurant through Groupon. Yes, this is a quaint restaurant that has been serving guests for 38 years. Regardless of what certain young people here have given negative reviews, the restaurant is outstanding. We are an older couple who have lived and traveled extensively in the U.K., France, Italy, & other parts of Europe, as well as Asia & S America, so we do appreciate the various cuisines. We had exceptional service with Pierre-Jean & Chip; the food was authentic & delicious. We thought the complimentary crudités was excellent; our entries of Le Magret de Canard (duck) & L'Osso Bucco (veal) with sides of fetuccine & French beans were well prepared & delicious. Our desserts of Grand Marnier Soffle & Profiterols were heavenly. We had a marvelous evening, and plan to return with friends, and or when we are celebrating a birthday or an anniversary. Truly, we were brought back to S France this evening. Thank you, Pamplemousse, especially Pierre-Jean & Chip!
