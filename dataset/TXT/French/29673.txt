Fd25lEnclIwyWlSRgkbRfg In Pittsburgh for business and staying at the Holiday Inn next door, I got very lucky to find this place only a few steps away.

The atmosphere was very laid back with a very friendly and attentive waitress.
Being French (and my mom having her own restaurant in France), I am always very skeptical about French restaurant. 
This one offers good authentic food, a wide menu with simple or complex dishes and it looks like everything is made from scratch.
I had the salade nicoise, the mussels and the lemon tart and everything was DELICIOUS. You can taste that the ingredients are fresh and that the cook definitely has an idea of French cuisine. By this, I mean that he keeps it simple! He does not add too many spices or mix crazy ingredients. 
The mussels were in a very good wine sauce and the salade nicoise had exactly what is supposed to be in this kind of salad. 
The lemon tart was also amazing and definitely home-made. Too many restaurants overlook the importance of desserts but this one definitely nailed it. 
Very good job and Pittsburgh inhabitants, please give it a try!
