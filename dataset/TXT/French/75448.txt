Ycp3Agr7dt71TZkeKV7jng I try to stay away from sweets for breakfast, but couldn't resist with their chocolate croissant ($2). I think I scarfed it down so quickly because it was that good! The chocolate wasn't too sweet and the croissant was just moist enough. I believe they bake their pastries fresh every morning. 

I tried a brie breakfast croissant ($4.50) on another day. It was good, but I didn't find it great. I don't know if grilling it or heating it up is an option, but I'm sure it would have made the sandwich better.

It's a quaint area with dark wooden tables, chalkboard on the walls, and in the mornings the lines can become a little long. It's worth it though.
