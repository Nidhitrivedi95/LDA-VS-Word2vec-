rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Came in the other week for brunch. Experienced a minor wait. Host and staff helped immediately to seat. 

There is plenty to look around at walls, ceilings, and decor. Not a seat missing out on the sights. 

Service was consistent through the meal. Food and beverage order was taken. Server was well articulated on the specials for the day. I ordered the quiche of the day. Also ordered was the Bouchon Breakfast. Quiche for the day was florentine. The breakfast was a good variety of breakfast classic dishes with protein, egg, potatoe croquette. toast with homemade preserves. All items were hot, seasoned. The quiche was full of fresh spinach and offered with arugula. The crust was nice and fluffy. The egg spinach was plenty more spinach to egg. Plenty of flavor. Not lacking a thing.

Overall good experience leaving me wanting to visit again.
