sphMzEIqY1I2Dzv3zLZY2g I have dined with Chef Bernard over 10 times and it never fails to be like a new first time.  What makes it so special are several things:  1) the food is just fantastic, 2) the wait staff have been there for a long time and know the food and wine/cocktail offerings like a best friend, and 3) Chef comes out of the kitchen to visit the tables and see how you are enjoying everything - and actually deeply cares what you think.  

I've taken friends and clients 4 times this spring and have had most of the appetizers and many of the main courses.  I personally enjoyed the Butternut Squash Ravioli with shrimp, the Veal Tenderloin, the Divers Scallops, and the Paella, and have had tastes of the Sea Bass, Duck, and the Mahi.

My favorite appetizers are the Shrimp Ooh La La and the Pork Belly (to die for!), and the She Crab Soup is a must (being from Charleston I did not believe it could be as good as it is...but it is).

Let the wait staff make wine recommendations.  You will not be disappointed.
