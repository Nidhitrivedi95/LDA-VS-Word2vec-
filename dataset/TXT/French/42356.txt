L6RxkP8dneVGelDLUhjCug Everything I ate was very good. I tried the chicken pate chaud, the special Banh Mi with croissant sandwich, and 2 almond croissants to go. Total cost less then $13. Not bad. Service was eeeeh. Some if not most Asian restaurants except for the Japanese are not to keen about proper customers service and/or proper greeting....that's all I have to say about that. Anyhow the Health District graded the restaurant A. Which is why we ate there. I'm always weary about the restaurants in Chinatown. Cleanliness is a must. But I do have to add that there was a strange aroma in the air when we first entered, like bleach or some cleaning agent. I can't put my finger on it?! With that being said, I'll order to go next time.
