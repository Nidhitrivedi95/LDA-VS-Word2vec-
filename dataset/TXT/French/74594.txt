xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g OK so I have just had to rewrite this review because I remembered a detail about the service.  They do not have chocolate milk on the menu for my little girl.  This is no big deal, and can be easily swapped out for water.  

However, our waiter took it upon himself to have someone from the kitchen melt milk chocolate and stir it into a glass of milk.  It was the first time, I have seen someone go to such lengths to appease a four year old.  So for this act of excellent service, this place has moved from three to four stars.

The food was good.  My wife got beef wellington, sorry but it didn't hold a candle to Gordon Ramsay's.  I got a well seasoned, nicely accomplanied piece of fish and my daughter took down an indulgent glass of freahly made chocolate delight to accompany her pasta.

The view from this place in spectacular but we weren't seated anywhere near a window, and felt it would be rude to go trapsing through someone else's meal to get a nice look out the window.  The view is apparently so nice, that they have employed a theme park style photographer to snap your pic and send you home with a $30 keepsake.  The fact that the place is accessed through an elevator was just incovenient, the fact that it opened up into a fast paced kitchen was offputting.

If you happen to be at the Paris you have three choices for food in my opinion and in order they are:

Ramsay
Mon Ami
Eiffel
