mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q Having been to Joel Robuchon (next door) multiple times, I was excited to try L'Atelier.  I have flown to Vegas to eat at the fine dining restaurant - certainly the sister restaurant, while not as fancy, would be great, right?  They share the kitchen for many things...

I have to say the dinner exceeded my expectations.  Exceeded.

The way I look at the gastronomic world, five stars is either "The best _____ you can get" or "Unique dishes and combinations, executed wonderfully'.

This is the second version.  Veal, Duck, Asparagas, Foie Gras, Truffles, Fish of several kinds, Mushrooms, more.  All delectable, unique and perfectly done.  Eating this food, you understand why they like to capitalize the names (they don't serve duck, they serve Duck).

The portions and the pace were great, and we have a thoroughly enjoyable evening.  The food was incredible.

My final recommendation - there have several menus of varying numbers of courses.  Get more!  While we didn't try the tasting menu (the party didn't want to as a whole), we picked the most number of courses outside of it because you want to, should and must try as many different dishes when you go to a restaurant of this caliber.

Sharing tastes from your companion's plates also highly encouraged.

Love this place.
