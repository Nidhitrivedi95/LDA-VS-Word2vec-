4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw It's a great morning when my husband is willing to spend a little extra on Sunday brunch because that means we're going to Mon Ami Gabi! When the weather is perfect the patio is the place to be, but be warned to stay focused on the Bellagio fountains and great food to ignore any possible nuisances passing by on the strip. 

If the weather is not permitting getting a table in their conservatory makes you feel like you've been transported to a far off place...not in the dessert ;-) 
 
Food: enjoying every perfect bite of their eggs Benedict while sipping on my creamy vanilla latte is why I continue to come back. But I've had both dinner and lunch here a few times over the past few years with large and small parties and it never disappoints anyone's taste buds; but can lighten your wallet.

Local tip: join their Lettuce Entertain You rewards program...the coupons are worth it!
