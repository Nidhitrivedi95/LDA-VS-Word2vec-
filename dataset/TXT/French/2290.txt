0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g Absolutely superb! One of the best meals my wife and I have had together.

We celebrated my wife's birthday at Picasso and had a lovely time and enjoyed super delicious food. When I made the reservation, I asked for a very nice table, and they gave us one right next to a window so we could watch the Bellagio Fountain show just outside five or six or more times during our meal. It was magical.

There are many, many reviews of this restaurant - please note the other 5 star reviews if you'd like to have an idea of what your in for.

The highlights for us were the poached oysters, which I can only describe as "luxury clams" - I've never had poached oysters, but now I'll be chasing this taste for years to come. I think I could have been happy with 15 or 20 of these guys for dinner, but 4 was delicious. We also really enjoyed the lobster and my wife's pigeon which wasn't nearly as gamey as they suggested - it tasted to me like a leaner duck maybe. It was delicious.

We also each enjoyed the somm's wine pairing for our meal. The amount of wine was perfect, and major cheers to the somm who made the pairings because they were just about perfect. Personally, I'd prefer a bottle of very high quality sake over white wine with seafood, but their choices were wonderful. I loved every glass.

I cannot recommend Picasso's highly enough. If you're staying on the strip in Vegas and you can afford it, you should certainly check it out.

In the end, in September 2017, our meal was just over $520 with tip. That's for two of the price fixe menus, a $30 lobster supplement (totally worth it), and two wine pairings (not the deluxe pairings, which are just there for bigger whales).
