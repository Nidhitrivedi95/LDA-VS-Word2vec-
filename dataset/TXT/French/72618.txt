XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q We enjoyed the 15 course tasting menu as a celebration for myself and my wife, whose birthday it was. The food was fantastic. I have dined at many top restaurants, including other three Michelin star restaurants, and this equals if not tops them all. The Decour of the dining room was amazing, but not over-the-top. In addition, the waiting staffwas friendly, but not pretentious. Overall, the dishes were amazing, but I did have my favorites.in particular, the last of the 15 courses was awesome! it was done in the shape of the mushroom. The only thing that could be improved is finding some other way to affix the dishes to the serving platters besides make me a double loop of scotch tape, but there was nothing disappointing out of all the 15 courses.The black cod it was amazing, and the truffle corn puree was out of this world. Even though we had 15 courses, they left plenty of time in between courses and you were not feeling overly stuffed.although the price tag is high, compared to other three Michelin star restaurants, it is well worth it at least once. You won't be disappointed if you choose to get the 15 course tasting menu.
