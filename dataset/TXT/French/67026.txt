I went for my birthday dinner. We had the Apple Beggars Purse and Stuffed Calimari as starters.  The Calimari was good and the Beggars Purse was excellent.  My bf got the Elk Chop and I had the Grouper with Lobster and Saffron Risotto.  The Elk Chop had great flavor amd tenderness. The lobster was some of the best I have had, the risotto was great, the grouper was a little dry.

For dessert we had the beignets, they alone are worth the trip.

Overall a great romantic night out.
