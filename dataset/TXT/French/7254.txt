4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Monday morning brunch was lovely here on the patio. The fountains across the street weren't running, but we enjoyed the people watching. Service was very good. Food was good, but I appreciated that they allowed half orders at half the price. I wanted to try a few different things, and this feature helped! Bloody Mary was good and extra spicy! I would go here again.
