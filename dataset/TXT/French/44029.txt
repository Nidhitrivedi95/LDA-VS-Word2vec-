MdjIl105vqCYUGKFSUVytA Went here a couple months back for a friends birthday brunch. It was nice enough, decor is adorable and the seating area is spacious. 

My eggs benedict was fine, but they forgot the side salad. It was my first time there... I thought it was strange that nothing accompanied my eggs benedict but shrugged it off. However, I noticed other plates with salad/fruit as I was getting the bill, too bad. A place that charges $16 for eggs benedict really shouldn't forget the side. 

Service was good overall.
