_T7f2wUgNlJqxsR-cR89SQ Read many reviews before making reservations, all were excellent. The service in the restaurant is excellent, the view of the city was also excellent.  Unfortunately my entrée, the lamb described with crispy mustard crust was not crispy and the overall flavor was just average. The parmesan frites described as something to share was actually a small order not for sharing and had very little flavor. Not sure if they were cooked in duck fat or not. The daily soup was excellent and would highly recommend it.

Unfortunately overall experience was just average and not as expected based on past reviews.
