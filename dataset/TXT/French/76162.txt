Yp1swb-8pO8i-6-jaK2tsA HERS: We stopped here on a family lunch date. We had a party of 6. The bread came out 20 minutes after we sat down and ordered. Our waitress kept forgetting our drinks. When she brought the waters she spilled the water all over my moms chair, my mother was in the restroom at the the time, she didn't even flinch at the sight of her spilling the water everywhere and never cleaned it up! My mom ended up just taking  the chair from the table behind her. When our appetizer came out--which was the artichoke dip it came with hardly any chips. We wanted some more chips, and our waitress seemed less than interested in checking up so I had to get up and ask her for more. Our table was never checked up on, we didn't get asked if we needed anything and HIS water never came out. ALSO the female manager who was on site kept looking badly at our 4 year old when our 4 year old got upset for a brief moment. Our little girl wasn't loud and we took her to the bathroom right away to settle down. When my food came out it was okay. Nothing special. I don't think I will be returning.
