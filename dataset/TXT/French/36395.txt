I2nw7LGLSHN4uUgnHO5H7A This is a gem of a restaurant that many people in the Beach do not know about, because it is just off Queen Street. It is located in a beautifully redone house, and the ambiance is really nice: romantic, yet clean and spare. They seem to take great care in sourcing the ingredients, and the menu is adventurous enough to be interesting, but highlights the ingredients without overwhelming them. The prices are really reasonable for this level of food (mains around $20), and the service is attentive but unobtrusive.
