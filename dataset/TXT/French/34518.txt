HojKatUfX4UHWaPqtl63NQ 8th anniversary dinner to kick off the weekend. Upscale but not ostentatious. 8:30 pm reservation obviously. Request north east sides seating. Lobster risotto was creamy and fresh. Rivea salad is a spin of a fresh take on Cesar salad meets sushi hand roll. Octopus salad with coco beans and confit sweet bell peppers. Sea Bass and minestrone reduction. Medium Ny steak with Béarnaise. Pictures wouldn't do the flavors justice.
