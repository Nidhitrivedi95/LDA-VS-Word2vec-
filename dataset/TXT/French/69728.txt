WOd8tWsh2Yt_osHv-ngx_w At the advice of a local I had met earlier in my travels, I came here for breakfast.  It was the last day of my vacation, and I was determined to end it on a high note.
     They had predicted rain, so the buildings "rain attire" was on. (the roof pulled out, and their plastic windows were up and attached. I'd have preferred it open, but I can't control the weather, or people's predictions of it. But regardless, we asked to be seated outside, and we were seated outside.  It was pretty empty outside. there were only two or three tables being used (including our own.) 
     After perusing the menu I settled upon the "Mexican breakfast" but asked if I could not get guacamole. I also ordered "L'Asteroide" which ended up being a berry smoothie. My friends ordered their regular healthy fare. 
     Before too long our food arrived. My Mexican breakfast wasn't very Mexican, but it was very delicious. L'Asteroide smoothie was also delicious. Several berry flavors danced on my palate before sliding down to my belly.
     Waitress was great, hostess was great, place was very clean, and everybody was great.   I'll definitely be back. 

           After this place, I went back to the hotel, packed up my stuff and left Montreal.
     This was a nice place to end my vacation.
