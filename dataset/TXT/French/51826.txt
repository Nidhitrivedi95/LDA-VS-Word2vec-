pmoIMK8zGWvKsVOPDBYfzg We were on vacation and ate here on Easter Sunday. We both had the lobster thermidor, wow! Excellent. The crab stuffed shrimp as app's were to die for. The desserts including the "candy bar" were out of this world. The servers were very attentive to every detail. Great Place to eat! Will return!
