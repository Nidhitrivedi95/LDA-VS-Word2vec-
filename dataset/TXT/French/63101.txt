SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA This place is absolutely perfect!

Came on a Friday night and the only time I could get was 6:00 for a table for one/two. It was empty when I got there but quickly filled up.

Started with a cool cucumber drink while purusing the wine and dinner menus. My server, who again I forgot her name, was charming, bubbly, perfectly described the specials and answered all questions without hesitation. 

After the drink I decided on a nice glass of St Emilion to go with dinner. It was delicious, it's very hard to find good wine served by the glass, and this was it. I found the bread boy to be amusing, his only job is to put two slices of bread on everyones plate all night, that has to be the lowest stress job in the world!

So I started with the pate, made with veal (which I usually dont eat but hey I'm at l'albatros) and pork with whole pistachios and a lovely gelatinous coating, served with toast points , cornichons and pickled vegis. Simply delicious. 

I was looking forward to the cassoulet all week as I've made it at home but it literally takes all day and makes way too much for one person, thus the perfect opportunity to try some here. It was worth the wait! A leg of duck confit, a block of crispy pork belly,  shredded lamb and two kinds of housemade sausage served with slow cooked white beans and a tomato based sauce. OMG, this was to die for! So delicious, Of course I could only eat a few bites of the delicious richness but it was so worth it. 

I debated on dessert but passed and enjoyed another glass of wine while lingering. Never did I feel rushed and never did I feel odd eating alone, in fact they were quite charming about it and went out of their way to make me feel welcome. Every server who walked by stopped to talk to me even if it was just for chit chat.

Total bill was around $94 plus tip. Well worth it , I really cant say enough for this place. Oh and when I asked the hostess to call for a cab a limo showed up! Bonus!!
