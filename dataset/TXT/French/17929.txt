A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g I met a friend here for breakfast in which we had EXCELLENT individual quiches  They were so tasty I came back in a couple days for round 2 coupled with purchasing a variation of super yummy pastries which I took to go It is a good thing I don't live close to here as I have a real weakness for awesome baked goods. Definitely 1 of my favorite bakeries Will return when in the area
