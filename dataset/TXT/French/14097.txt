58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw A very interesting breakfast spot but not our favorite.  The ambience is great but loud.  Service was good.

I had the brunch sante which was excellent.  There was a thin layer of cheese spread on the toast that held the mesclun under the poached eggs.  Made for a healthier version of eggs benedict.  The granola was flavorful.  The cheese sticks and fig capped it off nicely.  

Sadly my wife did not have as good a meal.  They were out of potatoes at 1030am and the potatoes in duck fat was a key attraction.  Then the toast was cold when it came out.  And the eggs are not really scrambled but more like fried in a lump.  

Its a very cool store and a place you could go before a picnic or outing to stock up.  The chocolate selection is impressive.  But i have to give it three stars since it was a four for me and a two for my wife
