JezHN-9KKLTMbojq00VP0g First a few Don'ts:

1) Don't come without a reservation. 
2) Don't bring young kids 
3) Don't be in a rush

If you do any (or all) of the above, you will likely have a 4 star experience as well. We waited about 45 min in pretty uncomfortable chairs shoved behind a counter top. The waitstaff looked disdainfully at our kids. And the service was slow. 

But, if you are looking for a leisurely brunch in a charming and quaint restaurant where you can linger over delicious food, you've come to the right place. 

Everything was exceptional. My 7 yr old daughter didn't leave me even one escargot. My beer mimosa was huge- I barely could finish. The crepe was just like they serve in Paris. The croque Monsieur was huge and one of the best I've ever eaten. 

I would love to go back, if ever I was in Cleveland again without the little.
