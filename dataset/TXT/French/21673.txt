Bf-yMQiSmDZyqfGyFKQ0bA I'm a sucker for a divey place with good eats and this definitely fits both.   Fish tacos were surprisingly amazing...and complemented by the salsa and chips.   My mojito was refreshing.   The hubs had a brisket sandwich that was solid, but not as good as my selection.  He loved the craft beer selection though.
