htQgj-ANQpZGpIpkkrEmyQ One of the places I've been dying to try and finally had to opportunity this weekend for a friend's birthday and it was pretty worth that (long) wait.  

"Extra Butter" Drunken Crustacean's - Beautiful presentation. Not too much flavour but just enough to start the meal off right. 4/5.

Pulled Pork Frites - Absolutely delicious.  Also a really good portion, that it's shareable or even large enough to be a main if you're feeling peckish. Not only were the fries nicely crisp, the sauce was very tasty and the pulled pork wasn't too saucy.  I'm sure when you hear "pulled pork" you'd automatically think "bbq"; this wasn't the case.  Had enough moisture to give it a nice flavour. I'd definitely get this again. 5/5.

Chicken & Waffle - Very generous portion and had a fusion of flavours.  One little concern I had was how some pieces of chicken seemed a little undercooked with it's colour BUT I'm still alive.  I'm guessing it was more from the brine.  The berries in the description were merely a couple of pieces (I wouldn't have bothered adding that to the description, to be honest).  I absolutely love the ginger maple butter, though.  Had just the right amount so it wasn't overpowering.  This was one item on their menu that I've been dying to try.  Was it satisfactory? Yes.  Would I order it again? If I had a hankering for C&W without having to drive downtown, yes.  4.5/5

Hanoi Chilled Beef Salad - Very generous portion that Elaine would be very happy (only Seinfeld fans would get that reference).  The beef was nice and tender; the dressing was light yet very refreshing.  5/5.

The INSP Burger - One of the best burgers I've ever tasted.  The patty was so incredibly juicy and had so much flavour.  If you like burgers, this is an absolute must-get.  I would go back for this any day. 5/5.
