zw4Legbcu018p5WcZ74iWA This is my first poutine from a regular cafe.  The first poutine I had was from Garde Manger (read my other review!) so I might be ruined.  However, it was still pretty good poutine.  I also got the fish burger.

What was most impressive was the dynamic duo that runs the place.  They are very busy, they work in a tight space, and are still extremely cheerful and friendly!
