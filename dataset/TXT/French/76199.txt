Yp1swb-8pO8i-6-jaK2tsA It is pretty much a crapshoot when you come here on the service you will receive. I have had GREAT service and I have had service that completely pissed me off and made me not want to come back here.
However I did find  a server that was super awesome and i ask for him whenever I go ... Stephen. 
Their breakfast is good... 
But what I go for is the Asian Chicken Salad. Mostly that is because I have been kind of watching what I am eating and this has big chunks of freshly roasted chicken, cabbage and lettuce, (they will remove the fried wontons if you ask) 
However, their chicken cordon bleu is beyond delicious. It has great texture and great flavor . It really fits into a comfort food file . 
I also love their french onion soup, It is flavorful, and  and has sourdough bread  in it, with melty cheese all over the top. 
Their orange juice is extremely good, fresh squeezed and served in a chilled glass. sooooo good.
It isa good place for a group of people OR if you are just going out for a date.  It can get kind of noisy but in cafe style settings it is something you expect ...
