Dcj69NZJnbJhK-YHP_nULA Went as the lone guy with three attractive women to try and impress them, despite having brother status to two, and husband status to the third. It worked anyway.

They loved the atmosphere, decor and wine selection. I love the Belgian beers, and later went off course to try a banana mead and a watermelon ale. The bartender figured out my tastes quickly and plied me with samples. Totally my weakness. Everybody got what they wanted.

I've been here 4 times, and the food is great. People are friendly. Service was good. It's busy for a reason. If I lived closer, it would be dangerous.  My only downer is parking can be tough, and the prices are higher than I want for a neighborhood bar. They are trying to be a foodie destination instead.
