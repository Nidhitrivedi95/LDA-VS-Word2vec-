4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw We went there for breakfast and frankly I can't complain about anything! We were really there for the ambiance and requested to seat outside to see the Bellagio fountains as we dined. We were able to see one of the fountain shows but full disclosure: you can't really hear the music as well, or almost at all for that matter. It was a little crowded but nothing out of control. We ordered omelets and mimosas and to our surprise the food was amazing, granted we were also very hungry. For Paris, it was very reasonably priced.  

Service was a little slow and some of the servers did look a little hurried but we didn't let that stop us from enjoying our vacation, the great view, and good food.
