I came here for Summerlicious, just over the weekend and I thought it was one of those places that you'd love to take your date to. It's cute,  cozy, it was quiet enough that you can still hear your conversation.

The service was phenomenal. Usually most Summerlicious restaurants the server would rush you to order and avoid coming by to fill your glasses of water so you wouldn't talk as much, but I had a great experience here where the server didn't want to rush us and told us to take our time with the menu and wine list. Water was refilled frequently. The "bread server" was very polite and was more than happy to explain to us what type of bread he had at hand.

I don't think there was anything wildly out of the ordinary with the food. It's French, I expect a lot. I loved the little treats they offered before and after the 3-course meal. As a pre-appetizer, I had this cute one-bite cheese quiche... if I had more I think my arteries would clog, but it's sooo tasty. And for a post-dessert, I had this one-bite dark chocolate 'brownie' that was super light that looked like moose dropping candy. Out of this year's Summerlicious menu I really liked the Green Pea soup with seafood. It's so light and refreshing. Perfect for a hot summer day or night with a hint of mint. I ordered the Beef Medallion on caramelized onions and mashed potatoes... the beef was perfect!

I was initially worried about the portion, but it was perfect with a glass of wine and bread. I wouldn't mind coming back to try out their regular menu.
