4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw another great experience here... yummy bloody mary... good crusty bread and real butter... I had the salad with poached egg, bacon, and house vinaigrette... I just wish I had more bread to sop up that yolky, vinegary goodness at the end... pom frites excellent.. oh also had the crabcake, very good with a really good cole slaw... (vinaigrette instead of mayo)... the atmosphere is really nice too, classy but not stuffy... our waiter was ok but we had another waiter coming over and joking with us, etc, so it made up for it.
