xeFVRUjxorxjO_qjX8FNdw Took my mother-in-law for her birthday.  Service was warm and friendly and we all generally liked our food.  I ordered a salmon wrap and it was fine.  The apricot salad I had was excellent.  Very cozy place and I will also go back in the spring/summer when their patio is open.
