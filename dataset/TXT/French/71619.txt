XcWlBj5oQgzKhR7Cxovj3w If you are familiar with the original in Scottsdale, don't bother.  Menu is similar, but that is where the similarity ends.  Corporate ownership has messed with a beautiful thing. Stopped here while delayed, and having been to the original Zinc Bistro dozens of times since it's opening decades ago, I was excited by the chance to experience the airport version. Uh, nope. Service was eh, with no real recognition of being in an airport (i.e., there might be time constraints).  Ordered the omelet, which was overcooked and puddled in a fair amount of "lube" from the grill...took me back to my Village Inn days!!  The real topper - I asked for bread (remembering the as-close-to-Paris-as-you-get-in-Phoenix version at the Bistro) and got the following: "we don't have bread, but I can bring you some for $3" - what?? Curiosity piqued, I received some "grilled" slices of "baguette" that the kitchen miraculously found, served with two foil packages of butter.

I get this is the airport, but if you're gonna use the name, at least get a little close - Barrio, Matt's and L'Orangerie don't seem to be having the same problem. I hope the payout for the corporate ownership was worth it, Matt and Terry!
