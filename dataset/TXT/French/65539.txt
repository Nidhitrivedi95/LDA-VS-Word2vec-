U1LB3sRMGTu_h7Sf9QdNoA This café is really tucked away in Clarence Square and the first time I went I had a hard time finding it. The café itself is small, which means you run the risk of having to wait for awhile for a table, though we got lucky and didn't have to wait for more than a few minutes.

I loved every bit of the meal here! We tried the croissant, pain au chocolat, smoked salmon sandwich, and coffee. The coffee was smooth and made for the perfect match for the pastries. The croissant and pain au chocolat were buttery and crispy on the outside. The sandwich was made on delicious bread -- French baguette. 

I would definitely make this a breakfast or brunch stop -- or even just for an afternoon snack. The atmosphere of the café is lovely, the décor is cute, and it's tucked away out of the typical Toronto busy-ness.
