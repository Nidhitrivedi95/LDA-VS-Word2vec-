The food, however, just wow. I had the butter and sugar crepe and it was beyond delicious. Everyone in our group ordered something different and we shared some bites. My husband had the scampi and my mother had the monte cristo. Both excellent. 

We have been meaning to stop here for several trips and we are glad we finally did, and bummed we didn't do it sooner.
