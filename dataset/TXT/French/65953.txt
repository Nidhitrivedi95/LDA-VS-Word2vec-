udFcIcbWbxrO8uLF95WnQg Delicious French Bistro in PlayHouse Square- the finest fare you'll find in this district. I love the radicchio salad and the scallops entree. The menu is in English, staff is exceptional, and they have a decent wine list. On show nights they have valet. They accept reservations through open table so it's definitely a great spot!
