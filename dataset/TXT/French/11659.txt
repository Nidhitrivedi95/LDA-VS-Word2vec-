4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw we came here for breakfast.  I was expecting to be blown away by the food based on the reviews but that wasn't the case.  Although the sitting area was beautiful overlooking the bellagio and passersby, my husband and I were not impressed with our selections.  He got the chicken, Brie, and apple crepe which he said was flavorless.  The crepe itself was nearly empty.  Hecalao asked for fries on the side and ended up getting potato sticks/chips so dont order fries if you're expecting regular fries. I got the three eggs breakfast and my eggs were overcooked and the hashbrowns  were nothing to rave about.  One thing that turned me off immediately and the reason for my 2 star rather than 3 star rating was the distinct eggy/dirty smell that was surrounding us even before we received our meal.  I would pass on this place on my next trip to LV.
