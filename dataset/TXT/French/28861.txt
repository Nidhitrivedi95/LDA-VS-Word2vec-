el-3IdlW3bTCSnquLvH-3w I came here for a Saturday night dinner with V and L.  V and I had a hard time locating the place.  We drove around the corner not knowing the place was inside the plaza so you can't see if from the parking lot.  HA!  

We loved the feel to the place.  It is small but just cute!  The server was totally helpful and funny.  We ordered:
La Classique Tartes Flambees - crème fraîche, onions, bacon, cheese:  YUM!

Notre-dame Wood Oven Pizza - prosciutto, mozzarella, tomatoes, onions, 
crème fraîche, pesto:  Pretty good!

Chicken, Bacon, Mozzarella Pizza: WHOA, greatness!!!

Dessert:
Crêpe hot chocolate:  NEED TO GET
Crème brulee chocolate flavored:  GOODNESS
Crêpe nutella:  Was good, but the hot chocolate kicked butt!!!
