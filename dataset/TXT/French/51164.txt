p2OvNFiFKnRoWSRON4-lcA I wish I could give this charming restaurant more stars. I had looked forward to dining here since it moved to Olmsted Falls years ago. My overall experience was disappointing. 

The service was IMPECCABLE. Our server was friendly, attentive, and didn't hesitate to get answers to our "foodie" questions regarding preparation and sourcing.

We started with cocktails, the peartini and the kir veuve de vernay. Both were delicious. 
Then, the starter course: a tomato and goat cheese tart for my dining companion, and a mesclun salad with roasted tomatoes for me. The tart's crust was too thick. My salad was good but unremarkable. 
For the main courses, we had a pork chop with apple stuffing and a steak with tomato butter. Both cuts of meat were overcooked, tough, and dry. The vegetable side of julienned carrots and squash was OK, just a tad overcooked as well. I am a little forgiving with the steak because it was clearly grass-fed beef; however, a skilled chef would know that these cuts of meat require different cooking methods, including marinating. 

For dessert, we had the creme brulee and mousse au chocolat. Both were so-so. I prefer my mousse to be more light and airy, but this mousse is thick and heavy. 

Because of the outstanding service and other good reviews, I will give this place a second chance. But I will order fish the next time!
