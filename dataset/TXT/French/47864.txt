O3OH5IEFMPtz7mPKakPZ3Q We ate at Japaneiro last night for the first time and wanted to report and also give some updates.  First, they now serve beer, wine and sake; including Ashai on draft.  I had some excellent sake.  Also, there is some pretty nice otuside space for those that enjoy eating al fresco; it's finally getting cool enough in LAS to enjoy that, and it's quiet and pleasant outdoors.  

We went at about 8 and we were the only folks there, which, based on our experience, is a real mystery.  We had a terrific meal, including top notch service.  Many of the itmes previously identified as specials are now on the regular menu, but htere was still a very signficant specials board.  Sadly, oysters, which we definitely wanted, were on the board, but had run out.  INstead, we had seaweed salad (simply but refreshing); salmon ceviche (ecellent, with a very fresh set of wonton chips and a nice zing to the ceviche itself); the 7 oz NY Strip steak grilled medium rare, with the sauces and salts (we really enjoyed this, including the portion size, which was just right to have a good tast of beef but not overwhelming); shrimp done on a sizzling plate with asparagus and onion (the winner of the evening; the shrimp were a perfect size, and cooked just to the point of doneness, and the sauce that accompanied them and vegetables had us wanting to lick it right off the red-hot plate); and finally, their combination friend rice, which was a very ample portion (we are still eating today) and nicely prepared, with a smoky rather than fatty taste.  As you can see, we did not go quite as deep into the unusal specials as we wil next time but everything we had was excellent, and clearly prepared with great care.  We spoke to the chef twice and assured him we would be back soon; he was cordial and clearly enjoyed the interaction.  He did send out two glasses of plum wine at the end of the evening, and it made a terrific and tasty finish to the meal.
