Ht-_i0UAq7YDBaqJwcQMdQ The food was delicious and we absolutely loved it.  The desserts was also impressive.  The service was ok.  One of our waiters was trying to guess what our Asian background was - guess what, just because you have an Asian wife doesn't give you license to put others in categories.  It's unacceptable and inappropriate and it definitely affected our perception of the restaurant.  You can be curious all you want, but we're not here to entertain you - we're here to eat and enjoy our dinner.
