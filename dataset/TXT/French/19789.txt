aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw ummm... YUM!!!  I love Ad Hoc, so I dragged my Mom to Bouchon Bakery for treats one night while we were walking the Strip.  So good!  We went back another morning for breakfast.  Delicious baked goods (Do yourself a favor and try the PB&J Brioche).  Tasty sandwiches.  Super fresh orange juice.  Fantastic coffee.  Thanks, Thomas Keller!
