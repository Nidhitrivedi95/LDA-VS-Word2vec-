eJ9L40jm5VOXCIq7xs9kQw Was a great romantic evening with exceptional service. My wife had the mushroom ravioli and it was very good. She had them turn it into a main as it was only a starter which was nice. Great presentation and flavor. I had the rack of lamb which was also good but not memorable. The lamb was not "melt in your mouth tender." Wine list was very strong! One suggestion would be to not have the plates come out so hot.  It was literally was cooking the meat!
