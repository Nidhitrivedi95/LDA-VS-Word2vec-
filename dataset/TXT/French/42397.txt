lcTa0q9Wo4wNyLCIgWFRUA Came here for MTL à table and tried to take different things on the menu with friends. As a presentation, every dish is nicely plated and decorated. The fish soup was good and the fish itself was very tender. It tasted a bit too fishy for me. The oyster was filled with spinach, hollandaise sauce and topped with some salad. It was also pretty good. As for the main course, the sauted seafood was fresh and nicely seasoned without overpowering the ingredient's natural taste. The scallop that came with it was pretty big. As for the desserts however, the nougat was a bit too sweet for us and we couldn't finish it. The donut was good but tasted a bit plain. 

The service is quick and the staff is friendly. They came mang times to fill our water without being too excessive and asked us a few times throughout the evening if everything was ok. 

The place itself is clean. It's kinda dark in the restaurant but every table has it's own candle lamp so it's perfect for talking with friends. 

Overall, the experience was enjoyable. However, it didn't leave an impression strong enough for me to go back.
