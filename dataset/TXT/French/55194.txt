rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Breakfast done right.  They usually have a few 'specials' posted and those are probably the best deals.  I ordered the flat steak omelet w/ peppers and onion.  It came with choice of sausage or bacon with bread of choice.  The omelet was cooked well, the sausage was tasty, and the bread with the marmalade was excellent.  All for $14.99.  Not bad at all.

On top of the good food, the decor, service, and overall ambiance make it a very enjoyable experience.
