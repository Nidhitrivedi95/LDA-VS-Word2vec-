TI8BCPSStuOgnqBHyTtG9Q If you want to feel like you're staying in an office park, even though it's only blocks from the castle...then this is your place.  The outside and rooms are lackluster (you might even pass by it without noticing, and your room is a basic, rectangular room) but the second floor bar and lounge is pretty classy.
