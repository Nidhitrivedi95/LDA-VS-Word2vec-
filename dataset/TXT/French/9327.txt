4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Pros: We came midday for lunch and it was busy, but patio seating was still plenty available and we were seated promptly. I highly recommend a patio seat as your view will be of the Bellagio Fountains across the street. Staff was polite, friendly, and made great recommendations. 

Above all of this, the food was amazing! I had the chicken Brie sandwich and my husband had the lunch special seared tuna steak. Tuna steak was cooked to perfection and the sandwich described by the waiter as "unique" was uniquely bursting with favor. 

Cons: Nothing. We loved our experience here. We highly recommend
