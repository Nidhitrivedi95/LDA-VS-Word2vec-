SJo_IjvzdRtCvZVN0cbrRQ Wow what a hidden gem! This place is such a rarity for being located smack dab in the middle of Cuyahoga Falls.  The food is beyond excellent/fresh. Everything's Organic. They don't even own a freezer... The Chicken and Waffles are a must! David the general manager was so nice to us. He welcomed us, got us sat and made sure to gather our plates and ask us about our experience at the end of our meal. Came back today for the 3rd time and Ian (server) was awesome! Very friendly and good at his job. Thank you. We'll be back!
