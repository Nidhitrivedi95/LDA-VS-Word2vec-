ynYEgNimJOyb8dvyr9x0sA I was on my way to Winco's Food, when I scanned through the word "Crepe". Immediately, I turned into the parking lot &decided to give this a go. I was in the mood for something sweet, but turned out to be somewhat of a fancy restaurant. The owner welcomed us in &guided us through the menu. We chose appetizers that were at a reasonable price &ended up finding my way through desserts :] I was very pleased w/the customer service!
