The picture posted is Course #3 amongst 15+ of the Kitchen Counter Chefs Tasting Menu.

Renowned Chef Patrick Kriss meticulously constructs each dish, and provides a concise and vivid description of each work of edible visual masterpiece. My server Quentin was a star in his own right, professionally and proficiently attending to my inquiries, while taking the time to chat with me about favorite dining establishments. I picked his brain about preparation of the outstanding bread and butter made in-house. Needless to say, these two, along with the kitchen and front of house staff, were incredible.

Toronto is very fortunate to have @alorestaurant as part of its ever-growing culinary scene. If you're as lucky as I was to get a chance to dine here, I just have one word for you.
