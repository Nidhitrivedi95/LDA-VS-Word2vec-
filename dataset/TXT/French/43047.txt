LQ_gYNs5E10IGFE0NOyD7A Celebrated my husband's birthday. The patio is beautiful and management was super accommodating for our party. The fried chicken was ridiculously good with an original flair. We were a rather large party with several checks so cashing out didn't go well....maybe not the best option for larger parties but a must regardless.
