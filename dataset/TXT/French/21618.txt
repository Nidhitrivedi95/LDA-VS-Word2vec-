bEVWHtBRYVwqaaNF4mWNYg Went for dinner this week and I've stopped in a few times for drinks over the past few months. The food was great. The bartender is great. However they have one waitress who really doesn't seem to like her job. She was quite short with us and just generally unpleasant. You guys probably should think about a replacement. I don't think I'd come back for food. Drinks sure. Food? No thanks.
