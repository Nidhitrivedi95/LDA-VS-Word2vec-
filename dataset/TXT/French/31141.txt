GfGG0Xhk7yTJTikmk3jJFg Terrible service. Poor execution, most of the plate were not good, and it was very expensive (115$ for two). 

We were a group of 12 and none of us will ever go back. We shared our dissatisfaction with the waiter regarding some of the most horrible plates (foie gras taste like a cheap 2$ pâté, Ceviche taste like the sea, escargots deep fried, taste like old fryer oil) and they could not care less, it remained on the bill and they did not offer us anything ; not even a free coffee! The staff had an attitude from our arrival, we witness them being that way with most of the customers in the place! Not a lot of people look satisfied! Don't waist your money or time, go else were!
