XbG4OgFoaSIxQxVRhTxU2w A total gem sitting at the southern edge of the gay village. There aren't enough superlatives to convey how tight this gang of chefs works to bring you downright delicious and inventive stuff, like fish basted in clementine juice and lobster nachos. 

To boot, the atmosphere is really breezy and relaxed - there is a minimalist industrial feel to it - completely unpretentious and filled with all ages and strata of Montrealers.

The service is excellent.

Overall one of my new favorites.
