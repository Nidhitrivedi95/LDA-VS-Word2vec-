YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g Amazing! Came here before the MJ Cirque show (also amazing). We had the skirt steak and diver scallops. Both of them were outstanding and were very generous portions. The skirt steak was perfectly cooked and the sauce complemented it very well. Topped it off with the Grand Marnier soufflé, which was also one of a kind. Will definitely come back next time we're in town.
