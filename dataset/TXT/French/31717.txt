grHISDkIGwttYthhW8DxCQ Great little hole in the wall that has a great selection of both sweet and savory crepes. Tight seating and would fill up quite fast at peak time (we dropped in at around 4 pm). I got a strawberry Nutella crepe, my hubs got a banana Nutella crepe. Both delish! Friendly and quick service. Would definitely come back when I'm the neighborhood!
