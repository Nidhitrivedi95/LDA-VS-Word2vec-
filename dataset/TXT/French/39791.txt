K2C8dSx9215LLcIzHL959Q Everything was very nice. Loved the simple beautiful decor. The food was delicious and the staff was so helpful! We had duck, venison, scallops, escargot, beets, and rabbit. The only downfall for us was that we are simple folk and had no idea what anything meant. The waiters answered all of our questions though. Still don't know what some of the stuff was though! Attire: I guess jeans are ok, the one kitchen worker (not sure of his title) had jeans on. Again, simple folk. We are not from the burgh so we drove around for 20 min. trying to find a parking spot. Maybe there's a secret but we don't know it!
* I don't give away 5 stars
