utYpyFOjNisHl1h7lDGSGA Best French restaurant I have ever been to other then going to France. Came here for a late Valentines Day dinner with my Girlfriend. Excellent service, had a very friendly waiter who took care of us . They took our coats for us and hung them up which I cant remember the last place that has done that for customers. The food was AMAZING the menu is a rotating one so their might be something one day, then something else the next. I had a roast squab and it was just delicious. The snails were also amazing! When it came to the bill I was expecting a rather large bill, but it was cheap! We had a bottle of wine, appetizers , two main courses and a dessert for all around 60-70 quid! I am keeping this place as my special restaurant that I go to once in awhile because I want to be excited every time. Go here folks for a nice romantic dinner.
