cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg Definitely worth a visit if you're ever in Montreal. It's a nice looking restaurant, with a very busy feel to it. Made dinner reservations 2 weeks in advance, just to be safe. 

For appetizers, started out with the Cromesquis de foie gras, pork rinds, and a bone marrow dish. 

The cromesquis were absolutely amazing, and a great way to start off the dinner. Small cubes of deep fried foie gras that just melts in your mouth, washing your mouth over with fatty deliciousness. The pork rinds were fried deliciously, but isn't hard to mess up pork rinds. The bone marrow dish was probably my favorite, as I am a big fan of bone marrow, and this dish was crafted perfectly. It wasn't overwhelmingly rich, but the perfect amount of flavor and sauce that I soaked up with some bread.

The entrees were the PDC pork cut, and the namesake stuffed pied de cochon. The pied de cochon was quite a large dish, and I would recommend not ordering it for one (unless you plan on taking it home). The PDC cut of pork was the thickest cut of pork I've ever had, and it was cooked perfectly all the way through, which I thought was an amazing feat. In terms of how it looked, it was pretty much a large cut of pork surrounded by various vegetables and rich sauce. The stuffed pied de cochon was another matter, it looked almost menacing to eat. The foie gras on top, inviting you to try and even attempt conquering the meal. It was indeed a very very rich dish, with mashed potatoes on the bottom that felt like a meal on it's own. 

Unfortunately my companion and I were too stuffed to even attempt desserts, so I can't comment on that. All in all though, it was a very enjoyable meal and I will definitely return to try desserts. It's not a restaurant you eat at often, only once in awhile when you get that craving for some delicious foie gras.
