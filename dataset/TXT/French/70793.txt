XbG4OgFoaSIxQxVRhTxU2w Went for New Year's Eve and the owners took such great care to make it a wonderful and festive experience. The food was exceptional and the service excellent.  The owners are generous warm and charming. Great location and lovely space. I will definitely return on my next visit to Montreal.
