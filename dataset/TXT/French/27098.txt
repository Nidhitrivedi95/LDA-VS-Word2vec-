Dcj69NZJnbJhK-YHP_nULA Most definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Madison. We came in around 7:30 on a Saturday night but I didn't mind waiting about 20 minutes for a table because of their awesome vinyl record booth. It's a cozy booth for two where you can choose from a selection of records and play them on the record player! It was super cool and fun. A great date night restaurant. 

Besides that, the food is amazing. We ordered the butternut squash soup, duck confit fritters, mussels du jour, and the pork chop. Everything was so amazing. The mussels are definitely worth trying there. It's a little pricey but the quality of the food is worth it. Overall I would go back for sure!
