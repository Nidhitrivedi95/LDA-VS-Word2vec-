3uC7Lbc3RgUDTWQlBu4PqQ i really wish this place was in orange county! we came here nearly twice a day during the xmas holiday weekend for breakfast or a snack or whatever. lucky for us, their hours accomodated :D

we tried the huge parisien macarons, they're like the size of my hand, my goodness they are large aaaaand the blueberry muffin, the croissants, almond puff pastry,  apple tart, and more. every single pastry item was delicious and perfectly sweet. i hate it when pastries are dry or overly sweet or bland - thankfully, bouchon hit the nail on the head for me!

the packaging is pretty cute too so some of the items would make nice gifts i suppose.

bouchon bakery is located next to the main elevator section and the theater, tucked under the escalators.

ugggh i want some nao peese!
