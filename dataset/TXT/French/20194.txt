aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw On my quest to eat macarons like those in Paris, I had a multi-pack of them from Bouchon over the weekend. They stacked up pretty well against the Parisian favorite. A pack of six included pistachio, espresso, vanilla, berry, chocolate, and brown sugar/caramel(?). My friend had a chocolate chunk cookie that was to die for. Also available for little French-ie sandwiches that look alright, but kind of boring and expensive. 

This is a hidden spot underneath some escalators outside the Phantom theater. I probably wouldn't seek it out again, especially considering I'm trying to find the best macarons in the city, but it was definitely worth it while I was staying at the Venetian.
