oJZNHz5UUVUgrZwVBVlpYw This is hands down my husband and my favorite place in the world.  It is the perfect place to relax with a drink listening to the phenomonal pianists (Whitney Phoenix is our absolute favorite).  As mentioned in other reviews, it is also great for people watching since it is located right in between the Bellagio lobby and casino.  The drinks are delicious- the bartenders know how to make them right and the complimentary snack tray is always great.  We always have great service here and will continue to come back again and again.
