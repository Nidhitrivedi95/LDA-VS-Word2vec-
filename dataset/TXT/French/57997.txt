rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A My boyfriend made dinner reservations to eat at Bouchon while we were on our Vegas trip. He knew about the chef, Thomas Keller and his other restaurant in Napa (French Laundry) and wanted to try this place out. 

Everything from the service to our entrees were impeccable! Our waiter (which his name escapes me) was incredible. Very charming, greeted us respectively and warmly. He let us know some info about the restaurant and the specials of the day that we ended up deciding to have. 

We trusted the waiter's palate for the food, so for starters, we tried this pork belly dish that was HEAVEN in your mouth. We also decided to try the oysters that they get shipped daily. If I can remember, he said they have 4 types of oysters and we tried the best two. You can taste the ocean in each bite!  Entree that i picked out was veal chop sous vied with grilled cremini mushroom while the boyfriend got the grilled sturgeon with trio of beets and ramps. We were both floored when we tried the veal... one of my favorite dishes of all time! The sturgeon was perfectly grilled, great texture and better without the sauce IMHO. As for the sides, I liked my boyfriend's beet trio and ramps over the mushroom and "something else". 

Desert was hard to avoid... they had a selection of deserts varying from cheesecake, creme brulee (my favorite), to ice creams and sorbet (which we chose). We had the mango and passion fruit sorbet which needless to say, was a perfect ending to a great meal. 

Now to try French Laundry...
