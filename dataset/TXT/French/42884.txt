LnSjzFXh1GrOObsRP6LhBQ Staff was friendly and helpful.  Fresh breads, pastries, crêpes, croissants, sandwiches, salads, soups; everything looked delicious which made it really difficult to choose.  We settled on the following:

Leek croissant - flaky pastry that melts in your mouth stuffed with a savory cheese and leek filling
Strawberry Yogurt - more dessert like than a healthy breakfast option, consisted of strawberry puree topped with yogurt with a swirl of maple syrup and a a few raspberries 
Chai latte - as a chai latte sound be; it didn't have that weird chemically after taste like some places (Second Cup or Teaopia). 

Spinach and cheese crêpe - their crêpes and sandwiches are pre-made and reheated on the grill; cheese was gooey but grilling also made the crêpe crispy around the edges which I thought was weird at first but I ended up really enjoying the contrasting textures. 
Mushroom and onion bisque - delightfully decadent, cream of mushroom soup taken up 5 notches -- my new favourite soup!
Chocolate almond croissant - a chocolate croissant sliced open and filled with almond paste, covered with icing sugar and re-baked.  Like the leek croissant it's light and melts in your mouth but with added crispiness and caramelization from being stuffed and re-baked.  To. Die. For!

Prices are typical for King West; high but still less expensive than Spring Box (a few doors down) or Fresh & Wild and quality miles above Second Cup or Starbucks.  They also have a better set up than Spring Box where it's quite easy for your grilled sandwich to go cold while you wait at a separate station for soup (or salad etc). All the baked goods are outstanding and I will definitely revisit again.  I can't wait to try the rest of their menu!
