udFcIcbWbxrO8uLF95WnQg I found myself dining at Cowell & Hubbard shortly after reading Brett Easton Ellis' American Psycho which might explain why I could not help but think it just the type of place one might find Patrick Bateman sipping J&B on the rocks  (should it be transplanted to Manhattan, of course).  

Perhaps it was the ambient lighting, the cozy but close-quarters seating which allows for easy inspection of what everyone is wearing, or the presence of fresh cilantro in each of the dishes I ordered. Maybe it was our server, whose appearance was remarkably similar to Marcus Halberstram's, inquiring whether we were dining prior to a show and providing us with great service throughout the meal.

Unlike Bateman, Cowell & Hubbard transcends the superficial with deliciously nuanced cuisine and a pleasant experience in a modern setting. The shrimp and lobster bisque was rich, creamy, and flavorful with a lovely presentation. The braised lamb shoulder with sweet potato mash and rosemary au jus was good but did not quite have the 'punch' I was expecting from an entree in a fine dining establishment. I could not detect the influence of rosemary and the sweet potato actually stole the meal from the roasted lamb but all-in-all the entree was very good. My cocktail, tasting of grapefruit, was absolutely divine - I'm wracking my brain for the name of it but it simply is not there.

Whether you are merely an abstraction or an actual human entity I can recommend Cowell & Hubbard as a very nice fine dining experience. Call or use Open Table for dinner reservations; it's not quite as difficult to get into as Dorsia but well worth the forethought.
