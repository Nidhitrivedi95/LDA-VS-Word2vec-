XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q Hm... This was a very good experience.  The thing I appreciate about Joel Robuchon is that they are able to turn foods that I normally don't like and make it taste good.  I'm also very surprised by flavor combinations that I experienced here.  The service was great, as I would expect.  Everything was done well.  That being said,  I don't think it was worth the price.  I know!  How can I say that?  Because I've had other tasting menus or price fixe menus that I thought was equally enjoyable and a lot less in cost.  However,  I am still glad I experienced it.  But will think twice about returning.
