4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Delicious food!! I love the steaks (I always have a Filet Mignon) with the Merlot Butter that melts and oozes flavor! I love the "frites" that come along the side (french fries). They are so yummy and I normally don't care for french fries.
  I have been here about a dozen times and I am always impressed with the food and the quality of the items. It is a great date spot...has a romantic appeal to the atmosphere with great views of the Bellagio fountains if you get to sit outside.
  Leave room for dessert and enjoy the most insane Bananas Foster Crepe!! 
  The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because it is really pricey and you have to walk so far from the parking garage to get there. That might be a good thing after eating so much!!
