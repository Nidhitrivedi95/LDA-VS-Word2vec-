qnFdBp12seAxwe2_iHM2bA The food was quite good, although at the price you're paying, it should be better. The bigger problem was that both my partner and I suffered horrible abdominal pains after the meal, destroying an otherwise romantic evening. I think the culprit was likely undercooked Jerusalem artichokes. 

When I wrote to the owners to complain, they offered a belated, muted apology. It seems to me that if I drop $300 on a meal and then get violent stomach pains because of the food, the least they could do would be to offer a bottle of wine? A dessert? 

Anyway, I certainly don't recommend the establishment. If you choose to go, avoid the topinambours!
