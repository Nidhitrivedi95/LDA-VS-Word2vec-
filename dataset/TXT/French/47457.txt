O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q Came here for Three Square Restaurant Week lunch menu on Aug 31, 2011.  Soup of the day was butternut squash soup, it was more black pepper than butternut squash, but texture was good.  The server took it away before I could finish all of it.  The salad was large and dressing was excellent.  The crispy salmon was excellent as the salmon was perfectly cooked with a very light, yet crispy skin.  The salmon was served on a bed of lentils, carrots, and mushrooms, very tasty.  The steak frite was asked to be cooked medium rare, but it came out more medium well on the thin side, and medium on the thicker side.  It was very tender though.  The french fries are excellent!  Light and crispy, my dad couldn't stop eating them.  The strawberry ice cream for dessert was the most flavorful strawberry ice cream I have every had with a wonderful whip cream.  

We got there early right before 12 noon and it was pretty empty, the service started out a little slow as we had to wait a couple minutes for the menus and water.  Otherwise, the rest of service was excellent, staff was friendly and prompt.  

I would not normally eat here as it is located on the strip, but for Restaurant week, I wanted to give it a try.  I am glad I did.
