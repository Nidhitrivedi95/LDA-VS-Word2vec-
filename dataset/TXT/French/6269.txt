4cWrtMvfj-tomyEPgP7KFg I've been there couple weeks ago. And it was my first time. We had to wait a few minutes to get seated. We had a 5 course meal and the best part was desert. Imagine yourself a plate with strawberries and bananas and velvet cake and other cakes and pastry that you can dip in the melted chocolate. Staff is all around friendly and effecient. 

In general I liked it. I'd say it can be a good romantic place for couples. Find time when you are not in rush and can spend and enjoy the food and each others company for about 3 hours since you'll be cooking in the pots right in front of you on your table. Can be a good unrushed experience. Thanks Melting Pot!
