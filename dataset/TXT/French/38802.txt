jLxeBgWhLRbII2ACkgH1Sg All in all as you would expect from a French cafe: Fresh pastries, bread, treats, and homemade sandwiches and small dishes. The items are a little pricier than average, and not the biggest, put the ingredients and presentation are very nice. This place has a nice lunchtime or weekend brunch feel. But it is open 7am-7pm daily. You can sit outside, order some coffee, and get a nice meal for $10ish. 

French bakeries are popping up in the area recently and thy are all very similar, so I might have to come back here to see if anything really pops out. For now, it is just a very solid take on the French cafe.
