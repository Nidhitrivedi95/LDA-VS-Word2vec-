Ncvd4l3zo72FUK5kovQhYQ Met friends for breakfast. Got there about 8, they open at 7. The place was empty and quiet. Had the waffle ...with real whipped cream and powdered sugar. Nothing special. The guys had the french toast. It was very sweet and the use baguettes, not good. The roll got hard and neither of the guys finished it. Their coffee was good but the mugs were super small. True it's self serve coffee but you can get up 4 times to have enough. We used the to go foam cups. Much better. Also had the garden omelette. That was made fresh and took up most of the plate. The best choice of the 4 of use. Will go back but maybe not for breakfast. Their crepes are popular.
