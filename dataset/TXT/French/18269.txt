A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g We purchase our croissants here, our macarons, our cakes, etc, - not to mention staying here to partake in the French Onion Soup, Salads and Quiche.

By far and easily the best French Bakery in the area if not Vegas. We recently had one of their cakes at a restaurant for a celebration, when the staff brought it out the entire restaurant quieted and watched this fabulous creation brought to the table.

Definite stop - no matter where you live in the valley, make it here!
