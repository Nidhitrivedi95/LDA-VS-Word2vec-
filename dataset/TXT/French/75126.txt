XZ7eQLjyGXf6y69UT4SGhg LOCATION: at a nothing-special strip mall, the Lakes area
INSIDE: cold and uninviting, nothing on the walls. 
 About 7 small, very basic, 2-seater tables, white plastic patio chairs. 
FOOD: I tried the La Tradition galette, it was tasty and filling. But, at $9, I don't feel it was worth it.  

The experience and the setting is not on par with the pricing. I would prefer La Belle Terre for its ambience and better pricing. 
I don't see myself coming back any time soon.
