4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Nice ambiance, cute table layout- choice of patio, pavilion-type, or completely indoors; easy to make a reservation (on a Monday afternoon at least), & the waitstaff were very accommodating, friendly, and informative. We chose to sit under the glass pavilion for lunch and although it was scorching hot outside, the ac from right above us kept us cool throughout our meal. Seafood combo platter was super fresh and probably the main reason I would go back but my partner also enjoyed the escargot and the (classic) steak & frites. The bacon poutine was disappointing- thin and hard potato sticks with barely any sauce and over-cooked bacon bits. Also felt that the lunch menu was very limited and discovered the beef Wellington is only a Sunday special.
