nkHaix6KenApS8M-liZsCQ I imagine it must be difficult to provide a successful upscale dining experience in a city where it's not uncommon for $30 plates and $100 bottles of wine to be consumed by men in shorts, hawaiian shirts, and flip-flops. And yet, despite the Phoenix dress-down culture, Christopher's has redeemed a space in the snowbird jungle that will leave one feeling graced, special, and pleased to have chosen this as a romantic dining respite. Surely designed by wizards of space and style, the misting, shaded patio, lounge, kitchen-side bar, and two inside dining rooms give the feeling of old world mastery sharply clothed in new world zen. And the food? Delicious, succulent, creative, balanced, intelligent, and so on. As if all this wasn't glowing enough, the generous happy hour takes this fine food and drink experience and makes it accessible to those starving artists among us. Christopher's a restaurant that leaves me feeling grateful. I hope it does so for you as well. Cheers.
