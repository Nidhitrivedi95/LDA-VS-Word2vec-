Also bring your own alarm as they are obsessed with people evacuating their allotted seat on time and yet seem unable to pace their own service to to ensure you are finished--if you can put up with that then the food is indeed tasty, especially the simpler dishes--choose the steak and fries as they are yummy.  Stay away from anything complex--this is a solid college street restaurant--not a foodie temple as the prices and attitude would suggest.
