ey1eAQldmOASEuCdFVmTPA Simple breakfast place in a cozy environment. I rarely dine at breakfast restaurants and tend to find them all comparable. Great for big portions, bacon, eggs and toast type meal - I don't think I saw pancakes on the menu though which was disappointing. Only thin crepes or waffles.

My ham and swiss cheese omelette was tasty, and very generous with the cheese, however the egg was dry. The fresh pressed orange juice was also too sour for my liking. The highlight was the toast, thick, moist buttered bread topped off with my choice of honey and jam.

Portion and price wise, most things off the menu are affordable however 5$ for a glass of  juice seemed like a little much. 

I wouldn't come here every weekend, but it's good for a home style breakfast if you're on vacation.
