XKPosZx2j4RHcZ8Ewdwj0A Great little place. Reasonably nice inside. Service was good but probably not enough waiters/waitresses for the crowd as we went on a Monday night. Food was very good and well presented. Light portions. Wine list on the pricy side with bottles starting at 50 bucks and most being over $80. Overall 4 stars. 

My only complaint was that our coffees came out well after our desert.
