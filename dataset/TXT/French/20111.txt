aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw Bouchon creates the best macarons I've tried to date, and by FAR the best on the strip.  And I've tried macarons from Sweet Factory and Payard and they simply do not compare.  They're huge -- like the size of 3 regular macarons (and priced to match!) but the flavor and texture are on point.  I generally am not a fan of fruit flavored macarons but I love the raspberry flavors here; those, along with pistachio and vanilla are my go-to's.  Their vanilla eclairs are yummy too.  I recommend snagging tickets to Phantom and then munching on a couple of these afterwards!
