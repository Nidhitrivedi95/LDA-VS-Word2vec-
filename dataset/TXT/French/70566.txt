xaqW4NkmUCGRRjmLxiFJ6Q I've been here twice and it's always delicious! The dessert crepes are a little too sweet but the savoury breakfast crepes are delicious! The menu has changed a bit in the past few years but the service is always friendly! Every time I come they bring a sample of their sugar cane juice and napkins. Crepes are about $10-$15 each, but you can see them make it right in front of you with what appears to be very fresh ingredients! Limited seating and parking though.
