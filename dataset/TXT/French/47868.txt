O3OH5IEFMPtz7mPKakPZ3Q After seeing this featured in the Weekly, decided to check it out. I really loved this place. 

It's located kind of in the middle of nowhere and the place is small. The upside is that it's intimate. 

Started off with salmon belly ceviche with wonton chips. This is like the fancy man's salsa and chips. It was so fresh and they pour on the salmon belly. The truffle bone marrow was great as well. The rich fat of the marrow went well with the garlic. They even gave us three bones (instead I'm f the normal two) as they said the bones on their batch that day were a little smaller. The Uni bite was delicious at first bite but, as with urchin, you get that nice low tide aftertaste. I was happy the first bite was good. 

If those items are a little much for you, their Japaniero fried rice is delicious without being weighed down by a ton of grease. What makes it special? I can never say. 

Okay it's because it has chicken, beef, and shrimp. 

For dessert, I inquired about the banana harumaki. It's fried banana wrapped in dough served with mango sauce and sprinkles of cayenne pepper. Of course I got that! Loved the warmth of the banana, the crispiness of the dough with the sweetness of the mango sauce finished off with a touch of heat from the pepper. It was a great way to end the meal. 

What I particularly loved about the place was the service. The servers were knowledgeable, they explained the menu well and could explain the dishes when they came out. Sounds like a little thing but I've been to plenty of places where the servers didn't know half of the menu. Even the chef came out to check out how we were doing. Love those little touches. 

It's a bit of a shame it is out in the middle of nowhere. They have happy hour and reverse happy hour menus which looked great. Going to have to trek down there one day to experience it.
