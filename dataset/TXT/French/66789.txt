UpEVdq_euH-5mqCIgUAd2Q The food is great, but the service was TERRIBLE. My husband and I waited 40 minutes for our food. The waiter never came back to fill our coffees and when we tried to complain, we could not get his or the manager's attention. When he finally did approach us, he told us the delay was because he had a larger table that he had to serve. I pointed out to him that other tables around us (tables ranging from 1 person to 6 people) that came in after us got their food quickly while we were still waiting. He apologized again and told us it would take another 10 minutes!! 

When we finally did get our food, he never checked back with us regarding the quality. I had to wave down another waiter to get the bill. 

When we left the restaurant, I cornered the manager and told him about the lousy service. He gave the same response - "large tables"  - but then quickly said that was not an appropriate reason. He said it was unfortunate that we already paid otherwise he could have done something with our bill. 

Seriously guys - have you never heard of a credit note? And I've been in the service industry long enough to know when a waiter has forgotten to send an order in. Just 'fess up that you made a mistake and that your attention was spent on the larger table because you thought you could get a better tip off them. You guys are doing a disservice to the great kitchen staff.
