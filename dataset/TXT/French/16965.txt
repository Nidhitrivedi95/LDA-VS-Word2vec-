9cBklDZJZJFGY8_yIpRRHw I went here a few weekends ago with some friends. We didn't eat there, so I can't comment on the food. I'm merely reviewing the club. 

I was immediately displeased by how uncoordinated the guest list line was upon our arrival. I was under the impression that putting yourself on a guest list was supposed to make your entrance into the club more streamlined. This was not the case. When we lined up, we were instructed to leave the line and go find the person with the clipboard. When we did that, we were scolded for trying to talk to the "bearer of the clipboard" outside of the lineup! When we reentered the line we had to go all the way to the back of the line (in the pouring rain might I add!). 

Being on the guest list meant that we got 1/2 off the insanely overpriced cover charge of $20. Forking over that $10 didn't exactly make me feel privileged. 

The crowd that evening was an interesting mix that made for an entertaining evening. I was happy that there weren't too many young'uns! 

I really enjoyed the music, the DJ was excellent! HOWEVER, it was WAY too loud. We're talking painfully, eardrum shatteringly LOUD! I realize that this a geriatric complaint, but everyone I was with agreed that their ears were ringing well into the next day. I don't know about you, but I would like to possess the gift of hearing for years to come...and if I keep going to this place? That ain't gonna happen.
