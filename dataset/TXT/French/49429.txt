or4UVDjXEEjze3wNPjoAZA We like this restaurant and return frequently when we are in Scottsdale as we did today. I had mussels and my wife had pate along with a side order of matchstick potatoes. We also shared a bottle of rose from Provence. Everything tasted great which was no surprise. Service was great, as usual.  During the meal I knocked over a glass of wine spilling it and breaking the glass. It was my fault. Not only was the manager very kind, she brought me a replacement for my spilled glass: unnecessary but a very nice gesture. There is something special about this place!
