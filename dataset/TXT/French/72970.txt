XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q Listen, if you've not been here before, you need to add this to your "List of things to do before I die."  This place is the pinnacle of exquisite food and gold standard service.  The decor is elegant as to be expected and I agree with other reviews that I was surprised at how bright the dining room was, but trust me, you're going to want to see every single beautiful creation that you're putting in your pie hole!  I mean, for the love of all that is righteous, even the butter is a work of art.  No lie.

Our driver that evening told us to take it easy on the bread cart.  I should have listened to him, but I just couldn't help myself.  This place is the Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory of divine cuisine.  When someone's rolling out a cart of doughy goodness, you don't say no!  I had the cheese for dessert and weeks later I still weep because I miss it.  But it is the potatoes that accompanied my filet that I will never, ever, ever forget.  I can't even do them justice.  

The presentation is out of this world.  The service is impeccable.  The food is created, plated, and delivered with nothing short of pure love.  A truly special place.  A truly special meal.  Now, let me get back to work so I can afford another trip to Robuchon!
