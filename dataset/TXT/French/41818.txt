KRgTdfs4oVFUcATMfAoR4A They do tapas nights on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. We had dinner reservations but tapas seemed like a fun thing to try, so we did. Seems like a small staff, it almost seemed like a family-run restaurant, which is pretty nice. The decor seemed interesting, somewhere between a bar and a trendy restaurant.

Overall, though, it seemed like it was more concerned with attracting a gourmet audience (something about the purple lights and the tapas menu...) than actually just being really consistently good. All together we had 12(!) plates. That's a lot of different stuff. A couple were really great, a couple were really not great, and everything else was pretty much in the middle -- not bad, not amazing, and pretty much exactly what I'd expect from any restaurant.

Maybe if they concentrated on fewer dishes it could be great. The service is shockingly good - two servers for the whole place, I think, and we never really had to wait for anything - it's busy, it's got a great location. Maybe the non-tapas dinner is amazing, but it'll be a while before I go try again.
