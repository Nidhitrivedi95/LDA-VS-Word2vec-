SFnrHuVFSNiondFVUBLJZQ I think I was spoiled by the small crepe stand outside of the Notre Dame in Paris or something... yes, I am fully bragging right now. 

The crepe was okay, but too chewy and dense for my crepe liking. The Viennese chocolate was not very good. Where was the chocolate and cream? When I get anything Viennese, I want that cream like a mountain on the top. Like obnoxious amounts of whipped cream. 

Decent if you are starving, but I'd pass otherwise. Service was attentive, but a bit rushed.
