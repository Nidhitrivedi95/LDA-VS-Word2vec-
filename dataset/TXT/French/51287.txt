P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ We made reservations at Guy Savoy before Love (Cirque du Soleil).

What an experience.  The food was out of this world.  My wife had a truffle soup and I ate a bunny.  We really enjoyed the bread pairings with each course.

The service was on top of everything.  Any time we needed something, someone was there - like mindreaders.

But, yah, it was expensive.  Yelp doesn't have enough $$$ dollar-symbols for this place.  Dinner for two is probably going to be in the $300 to $400 range.
