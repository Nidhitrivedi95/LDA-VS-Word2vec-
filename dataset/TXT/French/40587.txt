KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA I was looking for a nice place to take the GF for lunch.  A quick search on the yelp app revealed the Marche Bacchus (MB).  Yelp makes these things possible.

We arrived in at the commercial center in the middle of Desert Shores and located MB with ease.

In the door we walked and right into wine shop located the front of the business.  Seats were available and off we went to our table.  I thought about picking up a bottle to compliment the lunch, but decided against it.  We thought we see what the menu had to order.

We were seated in an most excellent spot right next to an open window looking at the lake.  Paddle boat people, ducks, swans, and turtles.  

The GF ordered a glass of wine. I ordered a Chimay Grand Reserve.  The bottle being of a large variety also brought with it an ice bucket,

For an appetizer we shared a French onion soup.  It went great with the complimentary bread.

The GF ordered up a Rosemary Chicken and Asparagus salad.  I ordered up the Brie Cheese Bacon Burger with fries.  Be advised they do not have Ranch here.  When the food arrived we found it to very good.

We very much enjoyed our lunch as we sipped our drinks and laughed at the turtles.  Even better than the turtles is the people watching.  Old dudes with young chicks and the house wives of Summerlin.  Better than TV!

I can't wait to check this out again!
