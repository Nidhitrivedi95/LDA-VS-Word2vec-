hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA I found this gem a few months ago through Yelp. Boy am I glad I did!

Let me start with, the staff is super friendly. Always smiling, and they make it a habit to remember you by your name to make you feel welcomed.

The pastries are amazing. The croissants, chocolate croissants, and chocolate twists are to die for. They go quick, so come early or call and have some set aside for you. The chocolate strawberry muffins are also very good. Nice, quiet little bakery. 

Only thing that sucks is they are closed on weekends! :(
