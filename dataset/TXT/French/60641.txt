SCklYa_jhihWAcfIn-_chg My fiancé and I took a nice stroll from Riverdale over to Brioche in the heart of winter just to try out this place. When we arrived there was a bit of a long wait, about 45 minutes but let me tell you, it was worth the wait! 

I ordered the poached egg- special of the day, with salmon on a croissant. It came with mixed greens and a side of baguette. My fiancé had the scrambled egg with with salmon that was quite tasty as well. Definitely gotta try to chai latte bowl, so yummy. And we topped off the meal with the  raspberry tart that was served with a side of homemade whipped cream. Everything was do delicious. They have so many choices of tarts, cookies and cakes. Everything totalled up to about $45 which we thought was such a good deal. We will definitely be coming back again soon!
