Great food 
Excellent atmosphere 
Fantastic service 

The small dining room is nicely decorated. Although there is not much space it does not feel crammed. The food is world class. Every course was unique, well-balanced, and nuanced. The open kitchen is clean, and quietly efficient. The waitstaff met our every need and provided us with friendly, informative descriptions of each course. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who is interested in having a world class meal.
