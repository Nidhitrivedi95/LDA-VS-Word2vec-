XcWlBj5oQgzKhR7Cxovj3w I really enjoyed my dinner and the atmosphere at Zinc. The crumbled chicken salad was filling and freshly made. My only complaint would be that there was a little too much dressing. However, it was delicious. A respectable wine selection that was pricy but expected sincere it's the airport. 

Definitely with checking out!
