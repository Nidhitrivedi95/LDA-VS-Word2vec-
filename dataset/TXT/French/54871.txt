rBOpDqeQl0J_fbDtY-cWxg Cozy little restaurant... Though the wall paintings are far from perfect, it really adds to the atmosphere. Kudos to that!! 

The food is pretty good, especially their escargot and lamb!! There is no foie gras on menu which is a disappointment and the paté is just supermarket quality. As for desserts, we tried the torte and tartufo. They were delicious. My Mom ordered the crème brûlée which was not the best she's had.... If anything she'd know because that's the only dessert she orders if crème brûlée is on the menu!!

A personal dislike here: I have trouble going to a "French" restaurant where no one, not even the chef himself, can speak French. Italian restaurants I can understand... but French?!? No!!!
