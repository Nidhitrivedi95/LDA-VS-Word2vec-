Fd25lEnclIwyWlSRgkbRfg Very authentic French Brasserie, great wine list, wonderful service.  We had mussels in wine sauce for an appetizer, then I had steak au poivre.  They sear the steak in Dijon brandy in front of you, and the peppercorns are really tasty served that way.  My son ordered the Coq au Vin, which was very moist and delicious.  Everything is prepared in the traditional French way.
