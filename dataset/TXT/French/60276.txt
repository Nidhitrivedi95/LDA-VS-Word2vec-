SBnpT6JDbah-5l_52GM5sw I've been to the Sardine for both brunch and dinner. My recommendation; come for the brunch, pass the dinner. 

Brunch here is delicious- their Bloody Mary's are excellent. I had a pork sandwich, which came with frites and greens; everything was delicious! Service was very attentive and friendly, and prices were very fair for the quality of the food. Portions were huge: I had enough left over for lunch the next day.

Expect to pay twice the amount for dinner without an increase in quality or size. I went with a group of friends. We had a round a drinks before dinner and shared a cheese platter. Drinks were all good. The cheese platter, be warned, isn't your typical cheese/crackers/bread plate that we expected. We got four little chunks of cheese (not even a mouthful apiece), 4 grapes and 4 minuscule slices of pear. I think it was $15- you're really paying for the experience more than the food, and the cheese wasn't even that good. 

For my entrée I got the Hanger Steak. For $30 I expected more. The meal consisted of 5 small slices of meat on some soggy greens with a piece of crusty bread. NOT worth it- the steak was well cooked, but there wasn't nearly enough of it to justify the price. With no real sides, I was highly disappointed I paid that much for so little. All the people at my table were shocked at how disappointing my meal was. 2 of the other people in my party got the mussels/frites which they seemed to enjoy- portions were good and price was fairer than my steak. My other friend got the trout, which was pricy but tasty. 

Overall, I highly recommend the Sardine for their brunch, but recommend staying away for dinner unless you're really looking for something spendy. Atmosphere is nice and the restaurant is really gorgeous, but I definitely won't be back for dinner after that disappointing experience.
