Coming from LA and use to the Beverly Hills and LA restaurant spots this is a must top for a special occasion dinner! We reserved in advance and asked for a window seat and got the best seat in the house overlooking the Bellagio water show! Ordered the Roasted herb chicken and was delicious! Can be a bit spendy so be prepared but worth it for an occasion! Service was quick, our waitress was attentive and always checking on us and helpful.
