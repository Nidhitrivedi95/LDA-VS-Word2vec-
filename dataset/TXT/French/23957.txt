All the food is so incredibly rich and delicious.  Great service as well, and the price was less than I expected and than the quality of food would indicate.

Bottom Line: Make reservations, try to sit at the bar to view the open kitchen, go with friends that are willing to eat things like tripe and pig foot, order foie gras, don't look at the prices, dine in the winter to maximize eating of rich and fatty foods, and plan for your meal here to be the last thing you do all day. Because you won't want to move afterwards.
