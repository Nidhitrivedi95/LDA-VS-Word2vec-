SFnrHuVFSNiondFVUBLJZQ Nice location, lovely place well furnished.
The staff is very fast and gentle.
The food is good and well cooked. The crepes are tasty and big, I took a bagel too and it comes with a side sale with a lovely dressing.
As dessert of course I took a sweet crepe. It was Huge, served with ice cream, Delicious!
The prices are slightly higher than the average but it's because the restaurant is located in the middle of the old town.
If you can grab a sit on the outside of the place you'll be able to enjoy the view of the main street in the old town.
