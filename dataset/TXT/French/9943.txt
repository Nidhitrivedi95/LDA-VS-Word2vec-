4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Made reservations for dinner here on a weekday.  They had no problem seating us early and we were able to get a table outside.  Even when it's cold out, this is the best place to eat as you get a really great view of the Bellagio fountains during your meal.  The inside has a nice ambiance as well, but get a table outside if you can.  

Our waiter was incredibly attentive throughout the meal, refilling water, asking if we wanted more bread (the bread was delicious, btw), etc.  She even anticipated that we wanted separate checks and was more than happy to arrange it, which sadly most restaurants get very bitchy about.

We all got a steak entree with frites.  Don't order any side dishes - they give you a MOUNTAIN of frites!  I could barely finish half of them.  My steak was quite large as well.  I had the steak bordelaise, which had a yummy caramelized onion and wine sauce with it.  My friends had the filet mignon and the steak bearnaise, which were both very good.  Perhaps it wasn't the best steak I've ever had, but still excellent.  And with the addition of the ambiance and the service, I have to give this place 5 stars.

To clarify, this is a $$ restaurant if you order a non-steak entree (they have burgers, sandwiches, chicken, fish etc.) or a steak frite entree (the thin cuts of steak) without drinks, appetizers or dessert.  If you order one of the more select steak cuts or start adding sides to your meal, this is more of a $$$ restaurant.
