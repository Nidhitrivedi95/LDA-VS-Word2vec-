HojKatUfX4UHWaPqtl63NQ I recall years ago when I stood at Mixx Lounge and looked over at what used to be Mixx Restaurant and thought to myself "One day I'm going have a great dinner there" as I watched diners eating on the top floor outside overlooking the entire strip.  

It took a few years, a new name, and a very nice cosmetic make over to finally get me here!  My wife and our kids and I enjoyed a nice dinner with scenic views of the strip.   Reserve early; at 6pm we were the first diners there but by 7pm the place was full.  It was a nice cool night but heaters overhead kept us very comfortable. 

The service was friendly and the explanation of the dishes were in detail. With any dish, shaved white truffles flown across from Europe could be added on top.   I almost did this on two of my dishes, until I stopped myself and asked what it would cost.  $45 extra on each dish!   My only gripe with the server is that he did not even mention the extra fee at all. Had I not asked, we would have gotten a disappointing surprise on our bill.  Though I do love truffles, $90 on two small appetizers we ordered would be preposterous. 

Otherwise, the food, though a bit pricey for the portions, were pretty good.  The risotto we ordered was excellent as was the potato gnocchi with sage.   I've had better linguini and clams elsewhere.  

For our main entrees, my wife had the lobster and purple artichokes.  There was a lot of lobster meat but maybe it's just me but lobster always needs butter ;)

My roasted duck entree with bigarade sauce was fantastic.  Pretty near the top of my list of duck entrees I've ever had.  Beautiful presentation and delicious flavors.  

We ended with some dessert ice cream and sorbet and pictures to remember the view.   Worth a meal if you order the right food and remember that you are paying for a great view and dining experience as well.
