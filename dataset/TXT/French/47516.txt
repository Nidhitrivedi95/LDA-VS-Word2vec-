O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q We really liked this restaurant. Initially, we didn't go in because upon peering into the reception area, we could see a crowded and messy store room across from the hostess' station. We thought they were under construction so we walked away. However, we liked the menu and walked in. 

We had a couple of very attentive and professional wait staff checking in on us throughout the night. We had the bib salad with crab meat, which was delicious. The dozen oysters were exceptional. The cocktails were imaginative and addictive. We had the halibut, accompanied by various side dishes. Again, they were properly cooked and seasoned. 

The restaurant is beautifully decorated with dramatic black chandeliers. The wine list is extensive. If I had one minor complaint, it was a few staff members brushing against my chair several times during dinner. Nonetheless, I highly recommend this restaurant for the food, service, friendly hostesses, and overall ambiance. For two people, dinner including wine and cocktails was about $250 before gratuity. Now, if only they'll close the door behind them when accessing the store room.
