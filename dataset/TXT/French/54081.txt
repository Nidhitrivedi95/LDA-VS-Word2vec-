qTacF-_Iucc1Nxom_Za_5Q The good: Great French inspired spot and a welcome addition to the neighbourhood. French tapas style food. The gougeres were phenomenal and the Tartines certainly standout!
Drinks and cocktails are on point with a varied and innovative cocktail list to please anyone. We had a consistency issue with the Manhattans coming with a cherry one time or an orange peel another, but both were great and flavourful so no complaints there. 

The ok: the "grand aioli", their sort of French Antipasti wasn't so "grand". The steak tartare was good but not exceptional and its flavours were  overpowered by the chips it's served with (We probably had high expectations for it).

The bad: nothing was truly bad but the service was a bit slow (very friendly though) on a busy Saturday and remained so even as it emptied out. So order your 2nd drink the moment your first arrives. It's only been open a few weeks so will update if the service changes on our next visit. 

The only sight disappointment was the Beignets' apple sauce, not the beignets themselves, but as the menu is supposed to change seasonally that apple sauce will not be missed if changed.
