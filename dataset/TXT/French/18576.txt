And the monthly "vegan" night where a guest chef comes in to prepare a delicious vegan app, entree, and dessert.  (check out their website for more info)  The ambiance is interesting - kind of upscale with a neighborhood feel.  Overall, a place worth checking out if you're in the mood for a fancy pants meal.
