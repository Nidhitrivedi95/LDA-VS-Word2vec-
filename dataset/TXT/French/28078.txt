E2vRShw8WVt6zfugz-gwPQ I've eaten here twice and am really impressed. I most recently had the seabass over mushroom ravioli with a lobster cream sauce. My business associates, also particular about food, had the Chatter Ribs, which looked like a giant roast on a bone but was tender and lean. We also had the ribeye at the table and it was a generous size, with lobster mac and cheese. This is our go-to place in Whitby. Not on the cheap side - each entree was $35, but they do have Mill St Organic beer on tap.
