OkC86YtZ0Nm19my5F4GGrQ I have eaten here several times and really enjoyed the food and atmosphere, but the last time I was here not so much. The waitress was unattentive and rude. She never acknowledged thank you, had to wait unreal times for coffee refills. She never asked if we wanted refills we had to chase her down. The steak was just ok, but compounded with the rude, lack luster service. I am not sure I will go back.
