jLxeBgWhLRbII2ACkgH1Sg I really need to catch up on my reviews from March/April in Vegas...

La Belle Terre was one of the places we ate that I keep thinking about weeks later.  This was my first time here and we went here for brunch, late morning on a weekend so some of the pastry choices were already out.  What we did get to have was a Chocolate twist, Hazelnut roll, Pain au chocolat, and an Almond chocolate croissant, they were all delicious.  The roll had a soft, not overly sweet, dough and the croissants had a buttery, lightly crisp and flaky pastry filled with tasty goodness.  I especially liked the Almond Chocolate croissant with its sliced almond and chocolate drizzle on top and almond paste and the melted bittersweet dark chocolate chunks in the filling...heavenly, decadent and satisfying.

I also had the Montmartre crepe which has chicken, swiss cheese, goat cheese, spinach, onions, and béchamel (I ordered without onions.)  This was also very delicious, nice and creamy from the cheeses and béchamel, and the not-so-heavy taste of the chicken and spinach.  One thing La Belle Terre does with their crepes is before they flip the crepe, they sprinkle on some cheese (I think cheddar) so the cheese crisps up in the batter when they flip it...it adds a bit of sharpness to the crepe and is very tasty.

There are many more things I want to try here and I'll be over in Vegas in a couple of weeks so I'll surely be here to try some and adding inches to my waist.
