xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g Fine dining in the Paris Hotel and Casino at the Eifel Tower overlooking the Bellagio Fountains, what could possibly be better?  First off, you're going to pay to play here; though the prices are *reasonable* for this level of dining in Vegas (it's not Michelin rated or anything), it's still not easy on the budget.  The service and the venue are absolutely 5 stars.  The food was phenomenal as well, but nothing miraculous.  I am going to complain about the wine prices.  The glasses and bottles here are WAY overpriced, even for a place like this; with a corkage fee to match.  

If you're a regular Vegas goer, then this needs to be on your list.  It's up there with the Picasso or Michael Mina (my two favorites).
