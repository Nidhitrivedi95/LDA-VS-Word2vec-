XgkTmVrlHHO5g96AfOAfpw When the restaurant was known as Sonoma Grille, I usually loved the food and hated the service. In its new incarnation, everything is unfortunately the same except for the name and the menu. When asked which vegetables were used in preparing the Saumon in Papillotte, the waiter told us some turned out to be incorrect. Why wouldn't he know? 

Why does this restaurant take so long to get food to its customers? We waited 20 minutes after ordering to have bread brought to our table. Then, after the waiter assured us that our food would "be right out," another 10 minutes went by without being served. How long should a salmon filet take? 9 minutes tops. When I brought this to our waiter's attention, he patted my hand and told me to calm down. I was annoyed, but not flailing. Where does he get the nerve to put his hand on me?

The manager was of little help. There was some sort of problem in the kitchen. That's what we were told last time there was a long delay. Both times we were one of only a few parties in the restaurant, early in the shift. The new menu looks interesting, and the salmon was delicious, but I can get interesting and delicious food served all over downtown Pittsburgh, promptly and without being touched by the servers.
