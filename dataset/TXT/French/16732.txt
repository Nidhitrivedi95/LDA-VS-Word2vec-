It would be so easy for them to fix their service. Get a maitre d who can handle a drinks order and maybe get an entree going, or table bread or something but at "fine dining prices" service has to be there.  Here's my review:

We were new neighbours looking for the best place to eat nearby and targeted cafe du lac. We walked in, were brought to a table then totally ignored. And I do mean it took 20 minutes before we were asked for a drinks order. Which then proceeded to arrive a further 20 minutes later. I was angry by then. Starving and ignored. All this while we watched the proprietress (is that a word?) fraternize with a large table of guests as if they were the only people in there. Now I think that's a great thing, but with customers waiting for service, we simply felt like 2nd class, warty rejects, not worthy of attention. Then a table of 5 fellas walked out too, exclaiming loudly about the bad service... actually they said "the worst service we've ever had". They had been ignored too. My martini arrived without any garnishes, and my husband's apricot beer (which I ended up drinking) came without a glass. Table bread never did arrive. And we could not get the attention of anyone to discuss this. Now understand - these are fine dining downtown prices charged here. Paying those prices, I want the experience.

Finally someone took our food order. Trout on a bed of lentils, with rapini. Exquisite. Delicious. By then it had quietened down a bit and my martini & half husbands beer had kicked in. He was now the only one pissed off as he wasn't impressed with his poutine, but I was tipsy and having a good time.

If they could fix their service they're the only show in Mimico, other than Everest which is nearby and great Indian food.
