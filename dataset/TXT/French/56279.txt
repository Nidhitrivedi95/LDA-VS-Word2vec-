rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Went for dinner, but sounds like breakfast is really a specialty (I'll save it for next time).

Appetizers (9 out of 10) - had an endive salad with toasted walnuts and roquefort which was straight forward but well presented and very fresh.  The half dozen oysters were small, but very sweet.  The cocktail sauce and mignonette sauce were just OK.  The star of the appetizers was the marinated beet salad.  Yellow and red beets stacked with some mozarella cheese.  It was the special appetizer of the evening and it was awesome.

Entrees (7 out of 10) - I had the leg of lamb and my friend had the duck breast.  The lamb was well cooked with a nice sauce on a bed of arugula.  Parts of the meat were a little tough.  The duck which I tried had a nice glaze and that layer of fat just under the skin that adds a ton of flavor.  I guess expectations were pretty high since it's Thomas Keller, so maybe the rating would be higher if I didn't know it was him.

Desserts (10 out of 10) - Phenomenal dark chocolate mousse and they threw in a "chocolate dome" filled with hazelnut ice cream.  These were both insane.  The table next to us had fresh profiteroles with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce that looked great too.  There really were too many to choose from here.

Overall I'd give it an 8 to 8.5

Service was impeccable from our Dolph Lungren look-a-like waiter.  He was really good with that little metal thing that scrapes up the bread crumbs.
