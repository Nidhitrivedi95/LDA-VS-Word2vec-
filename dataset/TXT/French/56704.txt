rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Above average food and beautiful presentation, but at the end of the day it was not worth the high prices, incredibly slow services, and cranky hosts. Bouchon has fantastic pastries, but I could otherwise do with equally good brunch (with bigger portions) for much less almost anywhere else.
