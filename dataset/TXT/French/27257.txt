I'm greedy! There, I said it. I always want more that I can handle but I straight up devour everything that is on my plate. That being said, I would have liked a little more food for the price so they get 4 stars instead of 5. The service here is second to none. I had the duck and it was amazing. 

My GF had: Poulet - Pan roasted chicken breast supreme, fried thigh, savory sweet potato bread pudding, strawberry-sage brown butter and rapini. For someone who doesn't like to try anything without knowing what it is, she devoured the bread pudding without hesitation and questioning what she was eating. In addition; she usually only eats chicken breasts but this time around she ate the thigh too. Words such as moist, flavorful and utterly delicious were muttered throughout the entire course. For dessert she had the flourless chocolate cake, it was rich, moist, and great ending to a wonderful meal.
