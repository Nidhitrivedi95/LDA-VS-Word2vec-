LtDYRcMJbJPhXPEklT29Fw O.k. after craving duck for a week thought I'd try Edwin' s. Starting with the appetizers, my escargot was a bit chewy and lacked flavor. The escargot I think they needed a bit more wine, garlic and parsley. The snails didn't have a chance to get drunk enough and tenderized. Though, the portion of escargot was great and they were big snails! The other appetizer,  the Foie Gras was delicious. My duck breast was also very tasty and zippity enough with traditional orange citrus flavoring and nicely crisped around the edges. I did not care for the rest of the offerings on my plate. The wild rice pilaf was chewy and dry, seemed to need a sauce or something on top. And, the root vegetable was very  bitter. However, the duck was really well done with a good  portion plated. My companion ordered the rabbit and it was very tasty,  but you needed a spoon to eat the dish it was a bit messy-as he verbalize himself--tasty, but messy to eat. We rounded off the meal with the lemon souffle and we were glad we made that choice. Full bodied, great lemon flavor, not too sweet, but sweet enough and creamy. The wait staff was polite and hard at work. Our waiter seemed new, but very sweet and  pleasant to have as our server. The restaurant is cute, intimate and clean. Parking was accessible on the Historic Shaker Square, but it was Wednesday evening. Overall, I enjoyed the experience and hope this restaurant becomes a Cleveland Landmark creating new dishes for us to enjoy. The drink menu and wine list is also lovely. I was drinking the Rose' Champaign because I prefer sweet. The Champaign was indeed pleasant.
