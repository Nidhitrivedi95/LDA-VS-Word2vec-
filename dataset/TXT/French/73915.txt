xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g The food here was very good, I wouldn't say it knocked my socks off, but very good.

The service was excellent, very attentive staff kept our drinks filled and frequently checked in on us.

As others have noted, you're paying for the views of Vegas strip mostly.  I think the experience is worth the price.  But don't order drinks. $20 for a cocktail is away over the top, when you could put that $20 in slot machine downstairs and get free drinks.
