LtDYRcMJbJPhXPEklT29Fw 11 years ago we didn't really know the term "foodie" we just knew that we both had a love of food, cooking techniques and unique dining experiences...it has remained a constant in our marriage.  Edwins made our 11th anniversary memorable on all counts.  The staff treated us like royalty, fussing just enough to make our experience special without intruding on our evening.  The wine pairing was simply excellent (our wine steward went the extra mile by obtaining the vintage label for us so that we could find some for home).  We began with the seafood sausage as a shared entrée (the proper French menu terminology used here) and the moved relaxedly to the main event: The unique experience as well as a display of technique came in the form of the Caneton de Rouen à la Presse, prepared table side in two courses. The Chef/owner keeps track of the people who order this culinary masterpiece in a journal and we were number 50 or so (being in the company of about 100 other people certainly does fulfill the uniqueness of the experience) and is genuinely happy to see people enjoy his efforts and we certainly appreciated them, it was delicious!  After the salad course (once again served in proper French order) we opted for coffee and dessert which came in the form of Bananas Foster (also prepared table side because we were being pains-the-neck but they didn't complain a bit) with their own house made vanilla ice cream, a perfect end to a perfect meal.  If you want to make an impression on someone, or just want something very good to eat, go to Edwins.
