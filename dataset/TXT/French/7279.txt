4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I brought the 14 of us here for dinner at a Bachelorette wkend. My only complaint- we arrived on time and our table was waiting for us but the 14 of us had to wait and clog the line to be seated because there was only one hostess. Time to come on out and seat us Mon Ami!

Food and service were excellent and the price point is around $20 which is very fair for the strip. They even let us split into 7 checks. When we were done I walked my group to the Paris valet where our hummer limo was waiting.

I will mention that I like the lunch menu a little better than the dinner menu because of their wonderful French brunch items.
