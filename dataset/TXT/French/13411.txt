4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw This is one of our favorite places on the Strip for a lunch or brunch. 

Great quality of food, great atmosphere and staff. Try to get a seat outside if the weather is not too hot. 

The extensive menu is sure to satisfy everyone's needs but I highly recommend the crepes and the eggs Benedict!

We will definitely be back :)
