pmoIMK8zGWvKsVOPDBYfzg I have had the opportunity to dine at Andre's twice in a few years and both occasions it deserved three stars. Today's event was no different. It started of with a lecture by the waiting staff that our TravelZoo coupons were not intended for our entire group, however, eventually it was all squared out and the waitress lightened up towards the end when she realized were a fun loving bunch. 

If I am not mistaken the place used to have or still has a Michelin star. In any case it definitely does not deserve one. I wouldn't say the food is bad but it's far from being singled out as a top standard. Let's face it the place is dated. Walls with ripped wallpaper, a sommelier who forgot who ordered the wine, and poorly timed service to name a few examples. I enjoyed the beef carpaccio even though the portion was on the small side. The lobster bisque was a bit on the fishy side and was not poured in front of you, something I always enjoy at a good place. The creme brulee was nicely done and excessively sweet and came with some fresh berries. 

I guess if this was a advertised as just a regular place I would give it four stars, but the hype around brought on some disappointment.
