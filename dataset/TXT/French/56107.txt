rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Brunch at Bouchon is on a different level, thanks to the sublime Chicken and Waffles. Available only on Fri-Sun, nothing else comes close. And yes, this is a fancy French restaurant but chances are you can afford to eat here in the AM. 

So why is the Chicken and Waffles so good? The bird is brined for 27 hours before roasting, creating the perfect combination of crispy skin and tender chicken. The bacon infused waffle is great too, and even impressed my mom who hates American breakfast food.

If you need another dish to round out the meal, the other breakfast items are hit or miss so tread carefully. Try the Eggs "Oeufs" Benedict, but steer clear of the Croque Madame and Hachis de Merguez. 

Enjoy your meal, you lucky bastard.
