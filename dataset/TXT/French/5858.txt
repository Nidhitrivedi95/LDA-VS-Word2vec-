3rj1qpgFvkRWtAka17mhEQ My wife and I would go to the one near our old place every so often.  I know its a chain restaurant , but on occasion they have a meal that just has some great flavor , so why not. 

We have been to this particular restaurant , and both times H O R R I B L E service. 
The first time , we did not get our soup or salad , and the waitress was very few and far between on the drink refills.  Anyone that knows me , knows i suck down iced tea like its going out of style.  Sometimes i even have them bring me 2 glasses of it.    I think i got 1 refill the entire time.... needless to say there was a drought . 

2nd time it was gorgeous outside , so we decided to sit outside. .... BAD IDEA.  Same issue with the waitress ,  very little checking up on us.  She was not even the one who brought us our food.   On top of that , they charged me for 3 of the 2 for 15 dollar meals instead of just 2 .....  no apology , no discount , no free dessert ... no nothing.  Just a 15 minute wait to get it fixed. And on our way . 


I have sent a correspondence to the corporate office , and it has been nearly a month and have not heard anything back.  Obviously they don't care about their clientele.
