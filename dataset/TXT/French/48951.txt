OkC86YtZ0Nm19my5F4GGrQ I love Tartine. I have only been there a few times but every experience has been ideal. 

The intimate, well lit (ambiance style) bar and restaurant is cozy and welcoming. I had a potential party of 10 coming in and while they don't accept reservations they were understanding and extremely accommodating when I called in ahead of time.  

The happy hour is spectacular. $5 glass of red and white, along with a $5 martini list, including the classic cosmo coupled with contemporary concoctions like they key lime pie martini and $3 dortmunders and some random beer are a great happy hour selection all its own. Pair that with an extensive appetizer list and this 4:30-6:30p M-F happy hour is a hit. The cheese plate featuring 3 varieties, crackers, honey and raisins is delicious. The stuffed pepper is as enticing as it is fulfilling. The dates can be an app or a dessert. Each gem is only $5 so a strategically timed happy hour can mean minimal damage on the pocketbook with your taste buds left begging for more.

Tartine is a hidden gem. The staff is friendly, the space beautiful and the cuisine and libations are delightful.
