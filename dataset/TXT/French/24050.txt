cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg I don't know what happened, but the meal took 3 hours. 15 min to order, 15 min to get apps, then a 2 hour wait until we got our entrees. and we ate in 30 min and left. Our reservation was 10 PM. we finished past 1 AM. 
Everything was overly salted
Fois gras poutine was amazing. The fois gras was so sweet and fatty. amazing
Salted fish poutine with squid ink instead of gravy -eh. Combination of weird ingredients over fries that don't really complement it
Hot chicken -waaaaaay too salty
Beef Tongue -really good. Also paired with a vinegary veggie which made it super yummy. Very tender
Blood sausage -eh, but the mashed potatoes are SOOOOOOO good. Its cheesy mashed potatoes, so cheesy that the whole consistency is stringy. Really really yummy
Everything was fine, except we waited 2 HOURS in between our apps and food. meanwhile tables seated after us, at 12 AM, got their food all within 30 minutes. Maybe they lost our order? but no really apology. unacceptable
