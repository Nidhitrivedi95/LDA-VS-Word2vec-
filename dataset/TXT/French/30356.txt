FRuuIDOd21pTJHvEGIt1Gg Appetizer and dinner were outstanding.  I had the cold Foie Gras, which was perfectly paired with a pear chutney and a wine that was recommended by my waiter (do not recall what hte wine was).  Then had the lobster ravioli with truffle cream sauce, fantastic.  Dessert was creme brulee which was pretty standard, nothing too exciting.  took a star off to the not-exceptional dessert and service at times was a bit lacking, but the waiter was quite busy.
