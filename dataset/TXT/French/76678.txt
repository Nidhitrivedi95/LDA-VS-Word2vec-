Seated with a friend of mine (who received a small chair/cushion to place her purse on which was pretty cool) we both decided on ordering the prix fixe menu and continued to receive about 5 awesome courses of delicatible 3 to 4 bite-size gourmet dishes over about a 2 hour period.  We also opted for the wine pairing which I highly recommend.  If you want to have a great high-end meal and be treated with great service (it almost feels like each table is paired with its own personal server), this is one of those Vegas dining experiences you need to try...4.5 stars for the food and service and an extra half for the purse stool which'll score any guy free pts.
