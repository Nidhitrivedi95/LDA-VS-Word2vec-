ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug So many negative reviews about this place, glad I enjoyed it.

Yes my waitress was an idiot, but the food was good.  Bleu Cheese burger at midnight, forgot what the g/f had but she liked it.  Nice little place inside Paris to get your food needs taken care of.

I like the Paris Hotel & Casino, and this place adds to it.  You get what you pay for......now if the craps tables in the casino would do the same...
