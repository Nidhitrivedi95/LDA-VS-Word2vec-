O66Zy8Y13VBm72ZDhS4fIg I went there for the 2011 Summerlicious as well.

The restaurant is really nicely decorated and the the service was great up until the end, when we asked to pay separately and the waiter looked at us like we were crazy. He was so rude to ask us if "we would be able to cover the bill, with us all paying separately."

The food was pretty, but it wasn't mind blowing.  I don't think I will be back in a hurry. I thought for such a high rated restaurant the food would be amazing. I had the lobster soup which was nice in the hot summer weather, and the truffle essence made it really good. I also had the Cornish hen, which was cooked well and the blueberry tart. 

So overall the experience was nice, but it's not food that I would rave about.
