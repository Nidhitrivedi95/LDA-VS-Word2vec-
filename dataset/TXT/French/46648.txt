nkHaix6KenApS8M-liZsCQ I Visited Christopher's on a Monday evening and was surprised upon walking in at how dead the place was. There were only two other tables occupied in the entire  restaurant. This being the case you would think we would have got prompt attention and great service but it seemed to be the opposite.  We ordered and the long wait began. We started with the escargot, it was delicious, so delicious we ordered another for the table. I ordered the lobster salad and it was fresh and tasty, my friend got the goat cheese parmesan salad and it came warm, as though it had been sitting under a heat lamp for a while, for the amount of time it took to get our salads that seemed to be exactly the situation.

 We ordered our mains and while the food was good, the wait was almost unbearable. It took almost an hour to get our mains, I couldn't understand what had taken so long considering at this point we were the only people in the place.  I ordered the lamb, when it arrived the demi- glaze on the plate was hardened and the meat was barely warm. I think our server may be partially to blame, the food would have been much better had it not sat plated for so long before being brought out.  The same could be said for the dessert, it was decent, but the long wait didn't make it worth while. All in all it took a table of four over three hours and thirty minutes to get through dinner. Not a good experience for the amount of money we dropped. 

While I will give 3 stars for the freshness and quality of the  food, there are too many other great restaurants in Phoenix to go have to endure the mediocre service at Christopher's.
