j0baDQfMAGDm_QGdFMmb-Q A charming delightful French bistro. There is limited seating inside.however a nice outside patio weather permitting. A French couple bought from another Frenchmen and it has been a nice transition. This new couple, he handles the kitchen and madame runs the front of the house. She also serves tables with another server. They all do a great job. They make the customer feel welcome.the kitchen delivers the food in a timely fashion.

The previous owner had a more diverse menu. He served Coq a vin, lamblc
hops, steak frites,bouillabaisse,veal Cassoulet,filet of Salmon and tartares for apps.

So what we now have is a limited menu that they do things very well. 
I
I suggest adding some of these classics for the coming season.
