mr4FiPaXTWlJ3qGzp4-7Yg Nice atmosphere with good food and attentive service.

The much-touted hot balls appetizers are a little over-rated: they are basically breaded, deep-fried balls of something with dipping sauce and were edible but nothing to write home about.

For entrees we had the delicious beef short ribs and black cod.  Both were cooked to perfection and in manageable portions (I often feel that mediocre fine-dining restaurants throw large portions at you to compensate for weak flavour).

$250 for 4 people with some booze.
