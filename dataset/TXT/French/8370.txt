4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw first review! yay!

went here the other day with some friends for lunch. not a french cuisine fan but i just moved to the area so i figured i'd give it a try and boy was i pleasantly surprised!

the steak roquefort and frites is to die for. the natural juices from the steak just make it melt in your mouth! oh and the french bread they give you to start was amazing as well. i didn't give it 5 stars because the service could have been a tad better. there was a 20 minute wait but i counted about 20 tables open. they may have not been seating certain sections but if it's busy people have to eat right?
