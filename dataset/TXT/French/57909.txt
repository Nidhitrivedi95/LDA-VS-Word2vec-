rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Very disappointing ! I had a lot of expectation from this place , heard so much about the chef and basically it's really not that good 
Beside the food everything was ok so really the star is just for the food 
The fish dish was awful ! I even think it wasn't fresh because of the after taste 
Seriously the $1000 bill wasn't well spent
