4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw We had a reservation for 4 people at 10AM Saturday.  The restaurant was already quite full.  We bypassed the "No Reservations" line and went in the one for reserved guests.  We were greeted by a cadre of 5 people; not actually greeted, they made it appear that were intruding on their busy day.  We were seated promptly on the patio, right under a strong current of cold air from the A/C.  Nice ambiance, though a bit noisy.  Our waiter was very friendly, enjoyable and fairly attentive.  The food was a disappointment.  We all had the Special Eggs Benedict, that sounded nice; for a small premium over the regular Benedict (which comes with bacon), you get no bacon, but instead a slice of avocado and a slice of heirloom tomato, plus chives in the Hollandaise sauce.  So we tried it and ordered a side of date-glazed bacon.  How many slices?  It depends on the slice size, maybe 2 or maybe 3 - we were fortunate to get 3 slices and it was delicious, perfectly cooked.  The avocado was quite thin, the tomato had no flavor, one of the eggs was broken and the Hollandaise sauce was not as good as the instant sauce we often use at home.  The coffee was good.  It is ideally situated in the heart of the Strip and a good place to meet friends if you don't care much about the food.  It would be far more impressive at night if you score a patio seat where you can enjoy the lighted Bellagio fountain display.
