JezHN-9KKLTMbojq00VP0g I don't know... I really want to like this place more. I love the atmosphere. It's super cute and cozy.
But they're just a little off with their flavoring. I've been here a couple times for breakfast and have had their crepes. The way I see it is, vegetarian is harder to make and if you get that right then you probably know what you're doing. The vegetables seemed fresh but overall the meal was a bit bland. Maybe it just needed some salt. Maybe some msg would have helped lol. Or maybe it just needed more flavor! I had the French onion soup too and it was pretty much the same issue. 
Oh well. I'd come back but I'll have to ask for extra cheese or something to make up the flavor.
