wuuJhxMDAj5gGVdvobGHJg First of all, full mark for the atmosphere which reveals a cozy and dark tone, framed in a brick and wooden design. LTPB is remarkably timeless as its menu reflects the freshest markets have to offer and as its ambiance will fit any winter homebodies or summer strollers anxious to observe the warm streets of Montreal. Note: a party of two might not need a reservation but larger crowds will need one - we found the restaurant to be more of the gathering type.

The menu sounded audacious and mouthwatering but the actual dishes failed to deliver. We started with the horse carpaccio and the sea scallops, and we were impressed by the freshness, the balance of flavors and the creativity of the scallops. The combination of ingredients was interesting and each of the four scallops actually revealed four different flavors. The presentation paired perfectly with the elegance of the dishes with a very minimalist Japanese/Ikea approach.

Sadly, audacity and fresh ingredients are worth their (high) prices when top quality is reached and we were surprised at how much of a slapdash job LTPB made of its entrees. We had the halibut (wish I can't recommend enough) with chorizo ravioli and the fowl. While the fish really aced it with a very interesting use of the spicy side of the Spanish sausage, the poultry was almost half-cooked and lacked taste.

Moreover, the staff has questionable wine tastes and recommended us with a bottle which was inadequate for our food. I would advise that you go by the glass to balance the appetizers and entrees which are too "creative" to ask for one specific wine. Do not go for the Oregon ones but do ask for their sparkling wine as an appetizer. Trust your instincts.

Bottom line: great creative potential but lacks the perfectionism for the idea it is trying to accomplish. Food doesn't lack though, you will be full with an appetizer and an entree (this is not a tapas place).
