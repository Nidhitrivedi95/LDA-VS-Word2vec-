C3PVq7UpeHd6nz1_e-AtkA An adorable little place on College Street that oozes coziness from every inch of its walls. Its funky decor, delicious brunch scents, and smiling waitstaff lured a hungry group of us in one Sunday morning. The place looked pretty packed so we weren't sure that our party of 7 could fit, but they took us to a cute little hideaway up some stairs where we had lots of privacy and a friendly booth. 

As for the food, they offer your standard brunch fare as well as some Indian-flavored flatbread things they call nanettes. I wish I had ordered one of those, but I was in the mood for a sweet brunch and went with the Kalendar French Toast. I liked the berry compote a lot, but the bread was a bit too soggy for my taste (even for french toast). 

The standout part of the meal for me was their coffee. They have a special blend with a local roastery and it has an amazingly unique cinnamon-tinged flavor that we all flipped out for, even those of us who weren't coffee fans. The other highlight was the sweetness of everyone who helped us, from the hostess to our waiter. We had just come from being rejected by an unfriendly host at Utopia and were grateful for the warm attitudes!
