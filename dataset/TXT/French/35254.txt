Ht-_i0UAq7YDBaqJwcQMdQ Chasse et Peche is a very nice restaurant nestled in Old Port. Inside reminded me a bit of Gibby's--low ceilings, exposed stone walls. We went for a fairly early dinner (6PM) so it was rather quiet but it continued to pick up as the meal went on. Fine dining vibes without being too pretentious. 

Service was definitely a highlight. Our server explained the entire menu in great detail and was very attentive. We started with oysters and tried two of each kind--all were delicious. For the main, I couldn't resist the "Chasse et Peche" after hearing the waiter describe it. The surf and turf platter was outstanding, with each meat/seafood prepared perfectly and a fantastic sauce to go with it. Overall a great experience at Chasse et Peche!

P.S. make sure you write down the address or you'll walk right by the door without a sign!
