The french fries were beyond delicious, and some of the best that I've ever had. Steak frites you cannot beat. Salmon was seared appropriately and on a bed of tasty peas. A really good option at a reasonable price in Vegas. And everyone loved the desserts: typical French apple tarte Tatin and an overly rich salted chocolate tarte.
