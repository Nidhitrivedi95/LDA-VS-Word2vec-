XbG4OgFoaSIxQxVRhTxU2w We have heard about this place for a while now so we decided to try it on a Friday for lunch.
We arrived around 1:30 and the place was still almost full from the lunch hour. But the bar was empty, yay!!
We waited quite a while before someone actually spoke to us (greet us). So I am kinda of bummed since I was excited to try this place.
And the service stayed like that the entire lunch hour :(
So that would be my cons....bad service and the chef is nice but very not talkative, we felt like we were disturbing him, which we probably were but it was not crazy busy. Anyway, I always prefer to hear from the chef himself about what to try so he kinda told us but the waitress was more loud and clear, thank God!
On the positive note, the food was awesome!! The ceviche was delicious, very light and tasty. Then we tried the crab beignet (crab cakes) which were fabulous including the "ranch" homemade dressing!! MMmmm!!! After this we tried the fish taco and the lobster roll which came with a butter salad and french fries with Mayo. French fries were soft and greasy. The salad was very simple. I was most excited about the piknik table where my lobster roll was served on than anything else :)
Seriously, the food was great and I would go back for this.
Maybe they just had a bad day for service when I went.....or I am just toooo picky! ;)
