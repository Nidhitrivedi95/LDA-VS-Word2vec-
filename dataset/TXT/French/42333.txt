L6RxkP8dneVGelDLUhjCug I can't believe I just found this gem! 

I ordered the bun bo hue, beef pho, and a chicken pate chaud. All of their food items were flavorful, and had the perfect amount of noodle to meat to soup ratio. I'm very picky with my bun bo hue, and for the first time I could taste the lemon grass flavor. Hands down, this place makes the best bun bo hue in Las Vegas! On the other hand, the beef pho was basic and tasted like any other Vietnamese restaurant's pho. Nothing too special to rave about but still good nonetheless. 

What makes this place so unique is the bakery part of the restaurant. There was only a few pastries left, so I went with the chicken pate chaud and fell in love! It was a perfect combination of savory, flakey, and chewy goodness.

Can't wait to come back to try the other noodle soups and pastries!
