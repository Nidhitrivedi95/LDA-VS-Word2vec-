XcWlBj5oQgzKhR7Cxovj3w I ordered a bloody mary and a ham and gruyere bagette. However my sandwich arrived on a panini rather than the baguette. Not cool since the sandwich itself is entitled 'Ham and Gruyere Bagette'.  Husband ordered a zinc burger. Each were served with cold pom frites. The ketchup had tomato pieces in it. All in all it was tasty except for the cold frites. Expensive food and drinks: cocktails were $13 each, burger was $17.50 and my so called baguette andwich was $15. I realize this restaurant is inside an airport but too costly for a fast lunch.
