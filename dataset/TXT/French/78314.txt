yVNaMEBUslR_7GbFhurJEg We visited for brunch and were not disappointed.  The restaurant is warm and inviting and the staff very friendly.  The Benedict was prepared perfectly - we had one with duck and one with Guinea hen.  The table bread was outstanding and the drinks also very good.  

The only downside, it was over 85 deg and we wanted something fresh - like a bowl of fruit - but there were no options.  They tried to accommodate us with a bowl of the strawberry and rhubarb used to top the pancakes, which was a nice gesture, but really not the same as fresh fruit.  Our mistake for trying to order something not on the menu.
