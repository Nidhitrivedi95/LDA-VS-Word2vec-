aaWhSHpsE285eaSTzDxAMA The ladies that have previously reviewed Bistro 185 have done a really good job and they are spot on with freshness of the food, dining atmosphere, and the incredible waitstaff.  I go to Bistro 185 for their Happy Hour specials 4:30 - 6:30 pm Monday - Friday.

$5.00 per item, Available in bar area only
    * 2 Pork Shanks with sweet and spicy raspberry glaze
    * Asian Crab Cake
    * Coquille St. Jacques (Shrimp and scallops in a Brandy Alfredo sauce)
    * Bistro Sliders
    * Potato Pancakes with sour cream
    * Chef's Whim (Changes Daily)
    * Selected Wines - $5.00 per glass

Guys, bring a first date here, your wife, gf, boyfriend, whatever....its a pleasant surprise especially if the significant other has yet to wine or dine in this restaurant.  You should get some bonus points, more then you would if the other option was wing night at the local dive.

Again, like a broken record, your only other option in this area that compares and that I can recommend is Grovewood Tavern but Bistro 185 is open for lunch.

Enjoy!!
