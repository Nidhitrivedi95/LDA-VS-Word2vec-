7h4nuLjd18da9kg1Qc2rnw Happy hour experience was very good.  Great price on wine specials ($5/glass), half off appetizers, and amazingly professional & friendly service at the bar.  Portabello app was delicious, and it was a good value.  Nice atmosphere with no riff-raff demographic that is rare these days.  Can't comment on full meals or the French aspect.
