jSfnItqaOnEp2nenVF7fCg What a great restaurant!  Both chefs are French Culinary Institute of Paris graduates who own this quaint, BYOB, no corking charge only a $2.00 glass fee !  The food is Nouveau French and bar none the best in town!  The prices are moderate and we always save room for the chocolate tart dessert.  We go there often and always meet very interesting people from all over town and most times end up sharing the wines we bring with each other .  You will be glad you dined there I'm sure!
