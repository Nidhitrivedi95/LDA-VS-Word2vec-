SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA Get the cheese! Get the cheese! Get the cheese! I could come here just for that! Otherwise the wine selection is great (obviously a lot of French wines). The salmon and lentil dish I've had was prepared really well. The service could use a smidge of help though- I feel like it could be better or maybe the two servers I've had at different times were having off days. Otherwise it's not just a perfect date spot, it's a perfect any occasion spot!
