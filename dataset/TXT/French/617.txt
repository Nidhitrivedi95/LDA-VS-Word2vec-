-unEKbRspO6OuEaPdmRywg We tried Xo for lunch and everything, from the food, to the ambience and the service, were spectacular. The special of the day lunch menu for $25 had an amazing selection of gourmet appetizers and main courses. We loved the tagliatelle with rabbit ragout, the salmon with cabbage and sausage and the creamy cauliflower soup. Amazing tastes! Even the presentation of the coffee was sophisticated. The ambience of the restaurant is magnificent, with a mix of luxurious modern and old-fashion column decor.
Great place!
