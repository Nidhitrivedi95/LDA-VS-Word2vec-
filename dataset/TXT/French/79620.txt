zqNgwQjj0_XAll-neGikIw I was really hoping I could get a lobster roll as it should be.  Instead, I got an avocado, pesto roll with very little lobster.  Very disappointed.  I've ordered the lobster roll previously.  Tons of lobster meat.  No avocado and pesto .  Also, Merci adds Parmesan to your "lobster roll".  Not cool.  Cheese and lobster have no place with each other in the sand which world.  I feel cheated.  2 oz of lobster on each sandwich.
