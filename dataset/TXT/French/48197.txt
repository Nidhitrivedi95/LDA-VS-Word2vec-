O66Zy8Y13VBm72ZDhS4fIg This place has the worst service. No staff acknowledged us. We had to keep flagging someone to et our order, water etc. we didn't have one consistent wait staff. Also te food is below average. Sassafraz is literally the definition of mediocre Canadian businesses succeeding because there isn't much competition.
