w2tr0PA0b3tg8pId0kjM-A Let us remove the most obvious out of the way, shall we?  Yes, the price tag is high versus going to say a Dunkin Donuts or your local coffee shop for ho-hum sweet stuff.  Gaby et Jules dishes out high quality desserts with ornate decorations that could double as works of art.  I visited Pittsburgh for a week and dropped in at least three times to sample several of their treasures.

First of all, none of these desserts should be transported and left in a hot car or left unrefrigerated.  The creme, gels, and filllings will melt down and you'll be sad to have spent your hard earned dollars on a small colorful puddle; treat them as though they are ice cream servings.  The macarons can keep longer but they too should be eaten when cool to experience the outer shell crunch and soft, inner layer of subtle flavors.

So, my selections consisted of:

1) Le Croustillant Aux 3 Chocolats - basically a combination of three different chocolates that are smooth like mousse with hints of hazelnut, and less sweet than your average chocolate milk.  Unbelievably delicious.

2) La Jolousie - soft texture, perfect blend of Bavarian creme, strawberry gel, mint panna cotta layered on a Madeleine crust with a touch of almond.  Dessert wet dream has just occurred!! 

3) Bavarois - at first glance, a red velvet cake?  Nope, the fruit custard top and what I imagine is close to an airy pound cake as its base.  Good, but not my favorite.

4) Apricot and panna cotta swirl cup - not the actual name but it describes exactly what it is.  An apricot gelee and panna cotta mix never gets too sweet and hits a home run for me on the third visit.  The plastic spoon easy breaks through the layers and the two flavors are an ideal match.  It is so light that even when you are too full for dessert, it will still fit in your belly.

If you got the extra few bucks to spare and want perfection, look no further.
