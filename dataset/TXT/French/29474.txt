F3rhQVjwggLiN4LsL2kXdQ This place really served some spectacular food.  The food is traditional French which means it is excellent and rich.  The prices were good but a bit higher than he two $$ it had on my phone looking at the map.  Entrees were in he $22-29 range which I would say is more $$$. However, I think they were less expensive than they should have been. I would definitely go back.  Though they really need to make the bathroom into the basement a lot nicer.  Btw, you can bring your own wine to this one.
