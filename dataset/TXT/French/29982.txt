fNCyfJOfd2R42hkhz2tALQ We ate her after the lunch hour and the restaurant was empty, so it was nice and quiet.

We ordered:

Calamari Frites: It was just okay, typical calamari. the sauce that comes with it that makes it even better.

Rillette de Canard: It was just okay and I mean just okay. Bread was stale and rillette was small and nothing to it.

Steak Frites: it was so good and the french green bean was so delicious and buttery. the frites was on point and steak was little too small, however it was good.

Salmon Tartare: really good, highly recommended. a lot of good flavor on them.

It was so close to the hotels, we were in a pinch. if we weren't that hungry, I probably went somewhere else.

Service was good though!
