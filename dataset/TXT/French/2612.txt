0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g Definitely a solid dinner. 

Amuse: potato-leek soup with a quail egg/caviar and smoked salmon skewer.  Soup was creamy, skewer was cute.  Set the stage for an elegant meal.

First course: Maine lobster salad.  I really adore lobster, so this was a favorite.  Tiny morsels of avocado and melon added a fresh complement.

Second course: Pan-seared scallop.  The menu says "scallops" but one should not be surprised when a single scallop comes plated on a plouf of potato puree with a splash of veal juices.  

Third course: I substituted sauteed prawns for the foie gras steak.  I generally pass on avian liver, but the shrimp was fairly unremarkable.  I suppose at the end of the day, there are only so many ways to prepare prawns.  Thank goodness for the wine pairing which kept things interesting!

Main course: Sea bass with asparagus.  Some of the most light and flaky fish I've ever had.  Small portion size, but extremely enjoyable.

Dessert: Chocolate truffle beignets.  The peanut butter ice cream was a tad too salty for my taste, but the chocolate beignets were outstanding.  The warm chocolate center was a pleasant contrast to the crispy fried casings.

Petite Fours: Arrived on a tray, but went untouched by our party.

Take Home Treat: Cinnamon cookies.  By the next afternoon they were going stale.  Came wrapped in a beautiful orange box.

Final damages: $1025 pre-gratuity.  Included dinner and dessert for 6, sparkling water for the table, five cocktails, two wine pairings, and the other intangibles (excellent service, flexibility for menu substitutions, high-class atmosphere amidst expensive artwork and a front-row seat for the Bellagio fountain show!).
