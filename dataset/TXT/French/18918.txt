An_U8woQkFVsMqVblkImZQ I've been to Dessert Trends a few times and the experience has been uneven.  Brunch is rich and tasty, heavier than necessary but delicious nonetheless.  Desserts are...well...a little disappointing on the whole.

My husband said it best when I asked him to compose a review: "When I go for dessert, I'm looking for layers of flavour and some surprise.  This was exactly what I might have expected, but nothing special."  My heart sings for his food snobbery.  I clearly married the right guy.  And I have to agree with him.  The chocolate cake was light and chocolately, but a little flat.  It had none of the ooziness that you'd expect from a flourless cake.  Quoth my husband, "Where were the little explosions of joy?"  (He got a little carried away, no?)  My merlot poached pear tart was nice but also nothing that special.  

And service is always slow here.

Go for brunch, skip the dessert?
