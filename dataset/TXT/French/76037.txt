ynYEgNimJOyb8dvyr9x0sA What a cute little restaurant! 

Just got back from dinner with my sister and friend and had to yelp this restaurant! 

Waiter: Christophe- very cute! and provide awesome service!  He took his time to assist us with the menu and recommending favorites as well as being very attentive, our glass was never half empty.  He even chit chatted with us a bit.  He also held the door open for us as we leave- very nice!

Appetizer: Pate de Campagne w/ toasted bread- I normally don't like pate because I don't like that powdery taste but this pate was excellent- they can improve by giving more toasted bread as the pate pieces are big.

Drink: I had Riesling- I really really like it...not too dry- good selection de michel.

Entrees: We all had crepes
My sister had the Fermiere - she really like it!  I'm not a fan of mushroom so I probably won't ever get this dish when i return.  My sister gave this dish two thumbs up. 
My friend ordered the Nordique- I get to taste a piece of it.  It's really yummy and well marinade.  It has a lot of flavor- I highly recommend this dish.
I had the Mediterranee- I like it but not as much as the Nordique- i would give this a four star.  

The crepes- yummy!!!! a lot of cheese!  the plates nicely presented.

Each plate came with a side of salad- i love greens!

I will definitely come back to Le Chalet!
