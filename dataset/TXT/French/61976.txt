STX8NfaW_xP6YZq-wERHYg The food is d-e-l-i-c-i-o-s-o- and fresh. The owner who is French, is a really nice lady who was willing to go out of her way to explain French words and French dishes. The cafe is compact and probably sits about 20 people at the most giving a very warm and welcoming ambience. Their menu changes about every week. I can't remember the exact dishes we had but we each had a croque monsieur, a croque madame, crepes, salad and a chocolate mousse that was a weekly special. Aside from the owner, the waitress was also very cheerful. If given a chance, my family and I would gladly visit this establishment again in the future to satisfy our bellies!
