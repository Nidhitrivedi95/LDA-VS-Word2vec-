3rj1qpgFvkRWtAka17mhEQ Worst service and meal ever. Food took forever.  Asked for salad without olives- extra olives delivered.  There also was a piece of plastic found in the middle of my salad.  Had a bad experience about a year ago, but the family wanted to give it another try--- never again.  Wish I could give it negative stars.  I have only provided the highlights of the experience.
