AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw The crepes were good, but I'm rating this place only two stars for their poor service.
 
The staff seems to be untrained and, most importantly, discourteous. If there were automatic computerized dispensers or order takers, they would produce the same or better type of service.  

Their crepes menu is behind you when you're ready to order at the cash register and the cashier would keep repeating the names of their crepes, instead of what/how they are made. I'm sorry, but "Madam Whatever" is meaningless to me; buckwheat  crepe with cheese and ham is something that I can understand.  

They don't have many breakfast choices for kids, unfortunately.  And having eggs, but not being able to make omelets...well, that should not be called a breakfast menu. 

Furthermore, it took them 20!  minutes to make our crepes.
