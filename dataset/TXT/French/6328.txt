4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Came for lunch with my husband, we sat outside and the weather was beautiful. We ordered the frisée kale salad and onion soup to start, the salad was fantastic, the soup ok. I had the seafood crepe and my husband ordered the seal and fritters. My crepe was alright, the best part was the scallops but I wouldn't order it again. My husband's steak was tender he said, the sautéed onion and red wine sauce was good. Espresso to finish, overall a good lunch.
