AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw I have to say first the service is slow and rude but that is common with majority of the staff as Caesars and the restaurants, but this place has one gem.. The crepes! I had the Nutella with strawberries and bananas and its awesome. But be aware it s $20 so very overpriced just like everything else in Caesars. But if I picked one gem it would be here!
