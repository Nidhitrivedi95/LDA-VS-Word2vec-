U1LB3sRMGTu_h7Sf9QdNoA Went on the weekend to try their weekend only menu. They were out of eggs benedict by 11. So disappointed. The service was so slow. They really need more staff for the weekend. We got coffee, 45min after ordering. The food came 1 hour late. Tables beside us ordered after us, ate and left before we got ours. Just terrible. They most likely forgot our order. 

The Sunday menu was nothing spectacular, only good. Will not come back on weekends. Will stick to the regular menu.
