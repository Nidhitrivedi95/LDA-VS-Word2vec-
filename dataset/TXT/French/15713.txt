6fPQJq4f_yiq1NHn0fd11Q Guess we must have found this place right before it closed since it was about 11 pm. It really hit the spot, though, and there was no problem finding a table since it was late. I got La Forestiere, which had spinach, mushrooms, boursin and mozzarella, though I was tempted to get the crepe with ratatouille so I could have been reminded about cartoon cooking mice....

It looked like they covered all the savory crepes in bechamel sauce, which was congealy but tasted kind of good -- it was late, I was hungry.  Sure, it was almost ten bucks, but I probably would have spent just as much on something at one of the cafes, and for those with girly appetites, there was plenty for two people to share.  

After all, you don't want to be too full in Vegas...it could slow down your alcohol consumption.
