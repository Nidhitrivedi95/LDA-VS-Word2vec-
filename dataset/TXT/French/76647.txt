Yp9w4nhUowBU_IS_StFXbQ This restaurant is perfect for a quiet, quaint meal. We dined here for breakfast and lunch for two days and the food was phenomenal. We tried a bunch of different items on the menu and nothing disappoints! Our waitress, Emily, was by far the most friendly, kind, helpful waitress we've ever experienced and she made our time dining at the Wynn an experience to remember. Mimosas are great as well as their signature drinks. This is a place you do NOT want to miss! Thank you Tableau!!!
