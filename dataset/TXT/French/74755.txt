xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g My boyfriend surprised me by taking me to this restaurant for our one year anniversary. We had such a great experience from the view to the food to the service that we decided to go back again for our 2nd anniversary. The food was so decadent and melted in our mouths! We loved it so much that we decided to try them out for lunch one day & it was equally as pleasing! We recommend going for dinner, though, because the city lights add an extra amount of romance!
