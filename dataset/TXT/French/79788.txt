zra20XPGVL9P3i5hMoKjig Put this place first on your list of new restaurants in Scottsdale that you haven't yet tried.  The food is as fresh and delicately prepared as one could possibly find anywhere.  The space is gorgeous and elegant, yet comfortable and inviting.  The hosts, Valentina and Gian Franco make you feel as though you've all been great friends for years.  Nonna is Scottsdale's newest, little known gem.  You won't be disappointed.
