P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ Whenever I go to Vegas, dinner here is a given.  I have never witnessed such a high level of service and an overall complete dining experience.  The key word is experience.  This is not only a mere meal, and a very good one at that, but rather a period of time that your every want and need is catered to.  I only wish I could have visited when Maestro Savoy was in town.  This is not to say the chef is incompetent.  Heck his son, Franck,  runs the place and he makes you feel like best friends.  

OK first off, carts kicks ass!  They have a bread trolley with bacon bread.  Bread with real bacon bits!!!  It blew my mind, I always take some to go now.  They have all sort of bread for different foods.  The seaweed bread is another winner.  It seems as though you can taste the ocean through oven magic.  There is a dessert cart as well.  Pretty much a candy shop on wheels.  Willy Wonka eat your heart out.  Macaroons are my new best friends.  I can hardly write because of all the thought on my brain.  Plus everything is made in house.  

The menu is not expansive and I highly suggest one of the tasting menus.  The beauty is you can work with the staff to get something to your liking or if you want to try different items from your mates.  The staples of the menu are done to perfection.  The truffle soup for example gets better every time; it's addicting.  The same can be said of the sea bass, scallops and poussin.  

Do yourself a favor and go for the wine pairing.  The sommelier is excellent and won't steer you wrong.  

I've never been to a place where the combination of service and food made me feel so satisfied.  Of course some will comment on the price, but at the end of the night it is well worth it.

When I die, I don't want to go to heaven I want to go to Guy Savoy.
