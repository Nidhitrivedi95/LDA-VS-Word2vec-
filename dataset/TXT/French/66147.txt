ufwkkMd9yr9cFU1R5ONArg Ahhhh this place is so good! My friend and I came in around 1 pm and it was busy! Luckily there was some tables available so we were seated quickly. Started off with a pineapple mimosa and a guava/tangerine mimosa which were great! Good size for it's worth, we definitely want to try the other drinks that are available. I ordered the huevos rancheros with chorizo and he got the breakfast burrito, also with chorizo- both with half salad and half home fries . So delish!!! I was worried it was going to be salty but it wasn't!! Flavour was on point and everything was super fresh. The portions were great and we were so full. Waitresses were very attentive and quick, really nice girls. Definitely a staple brunch spot now, esp. on sundays when you can park for free on  the street
