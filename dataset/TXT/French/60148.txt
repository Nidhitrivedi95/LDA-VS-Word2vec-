sARavfidmIS878q5BtlyVQ Went to Jaleo at the Cosmopolitan during a business trip for dinner.  The ambience is nice and virbant and the area is very open.  The wait staff was very attentive and gave alot of recommendations.  They suggested that each person order 3-4 items from the menu as they tend to be rather small.  I ordered the Salmon with caudiflower and rasberries, Cavier with egg, Codfish with honey alioli, and wild mushrooms with olive oil.  The best dish out of the four was the salmon.  I was cooked to perfection along with the caudiflower and rasberries.  It was a very tasty dish.  The next best entree out of the four was the codfish with honey alioli.  Codfish was deep fried and in a ball (about 6 of them) and the honey alioli dipping sauce was superb.  What made me bring down the restaurant's rating were the last two dishes.  The Cavier with egg did not have as much flavor as I had hoped and was rather bland.  The mushrooms with olive oil also did not have much of an exuberant taste to it.  I should have stucked more to the fish dishes since they were excellent.  But all in all, not a bad dining experience, but also not a exceptional one.
