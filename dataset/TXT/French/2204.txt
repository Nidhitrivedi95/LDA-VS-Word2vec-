0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g I loved this place, mainly because I dined on somebody else's dime.  I have to the service was impeccable and the atmosphere was hard to beat -- complete with authentic, original paintings by Picasso on the walls.

I'm not a fan of prefixe menus, especially as a vegetarian.  I specifically  remember they did not make a big effort to accomodate me, but what food I did have was great.  

The dessert was out of this world.  I had some sort of sampler -- or maybe I just ordered everything on the menu -- either way, it was incredible.

All in all, a good dining experience, that I don't feel the need to repeat.
