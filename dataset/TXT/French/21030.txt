AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw I was staying in the hotel and walked down for breakfast. For 2 sandwiches and a chocolate crepe and cappuccino it cost $40 which is pricey but it was excellent. The food was literally finger licking good and my kids asked for seconds. I was tempted to eat the rest of my meals there but couldn't afford that price tag for the small portions. A local discount at ANY of the strip hotels would be nice since we keep them open in the lean times. 

I was pleasantly surprised and will go back to the hotel just to eat here. It has a few tables but is mostly a take away food place. I was stuck in a long line behind some conventioneers from a gynecology convention but these docs were tame and polite so it was tolerable. 

Getting in and out of the hotels is a pain when you're driving but eating there is worth it. Kudos. Damn tourists. ;)
