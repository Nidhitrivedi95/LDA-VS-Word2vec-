Ambiance couldn't be better. The lighting is perfect and the noise level not to loud considering the open space.

Their hours are fm 11am to late night....1:00am. Except Sunday they are only open for dinner. 

This is a must try at least once, but I'm sure you'll be hooked. I'm going back next week to try their salads for lunch.

If you live up north/DC Ranch Area, also consider trying their sister restaurant Local Bistro. Everything there is fabulous as well but my two favorites are their burger and chicken dishes.
