9n6BBipidP5Eyb9xGrS0Ww Whenever I travel to a foreign country, I always hope to find those truly authentic, special dining experiences.  Crêperie du Marché in the Marché Jean-Talon did not disappoint in this respect.  For a comparable experience, think Eastern Market if you are in DC or the Ferry Building Market in San Francisco or even the new revamped French Market in New Orleans - bustling, colorful and vibrant.  

Marché Jean-Talon is a local's food market, but well worth the hike up to Little Italy.  Crêperie du Marché serves DELICIOUS gluten-free (!) buckwheat flour savory crepes and equally DELICIOUS wheat flour sweet crepes.  My traveling and dining companion ordered a savory crepe with egg, swiss cheese, caramelized onions, and semi-cooked seasoned tomatoes and spent the meal raving.  Meanwhile, I went with an apple and cheddar cheese sweet crepe (my all-time favorite) and pretty much died happy.

You can find the cute little booth housing the Crêperie tucked into a corner of the market, so be sure to keep your eyes peeled for it - you won't be disappointed in this small, cozy slice of French-Canadian cuisine.
