oJZNHz5UUVUgrZwVBVlpYw I went there from a recommendation of a friend.  
I took my family from out of town there for their first afternoon tea experience.  Service was slow.  The sandwiches were average.  Pastries were not anything special.  I like the scones.  Warm, flaky, melt in your mouth.
My party all agreed that it was good to try if you have never had a high tea before, but nothing to be missed out on.
