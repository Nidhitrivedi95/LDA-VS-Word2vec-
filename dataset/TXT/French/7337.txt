4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw i had the best mushroom, spinach, and leek quiche here.  

when my plate was first brought to me, i thought, "that's kinda small."  but for a comfortable, not overly full, start to the day, it turned out to be perfect.  the crust was crispy and flaky and the center had so much flavor.  

on a chilly day, the best seat is in the sunroom.  the dining room seemed unusually dark to me - not even in a romantic way.  it was just plain dark; like you were in a steakhouse and they forgot to turn on the lights.
