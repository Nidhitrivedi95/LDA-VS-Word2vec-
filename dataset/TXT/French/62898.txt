SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA Excellent service. Great wine list with lots of options. Fresh oysters that were well worth the money. Good frisée salad, but the egg is a fail. That is not a poached egg. Overcooked.  Choucroute garni and baked cod we're outstanding. Creme caramel was perfect.  Finished off the meal with Calvados.  Low prices.  Great restaurant, not excellent.
