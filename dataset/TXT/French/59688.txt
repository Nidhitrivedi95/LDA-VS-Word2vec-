S50I4XsBmsWP1PNr_Q-StA This is one of my favourite restaurants in Edinburgh. I go with my Mum on a bimonthly basis when we want to go somewhere affordable, enjoyable and hassle-free. The French bistro fare is absolutely lovely. 

The menu changes on a frequent basis. I have never been for dinner, but the lunch menu is always excellent value for money and offers absolutely brilliant grub. There are specials on chalk boards on the wall so make sure to check out what's available. 

The very pleasant and helpful serving staff will give you a free small entree to get you started while you choose your main course. I've always had salads, breads and there have been sausage and vegetarian type tapas nibbles too. There is a selection of oils and dipping sauces on the table for your bread etc.

I've enjoyed a variety of seafood and vegetarian dishes. One particularly good seafood pasta sticks in my mind, where a whole shrimp, complete with whiskers and claws, was presented on top of my plate. Brilliant! 

My Mum usually opts for meatier options. She still raves about a lamb dish she had once, saying it's one of the nicest meals she's had for years. 

The choice of desserts changes too, but we've always had great puddings here. All have a French twist, so I'd go for the creme brulee or cheese plate. 

I'd highly recommend this restaurant for the relaxed atmosphere, friendly service and great food. It's far enough out of the city centre to be quiet and devoid of noisy crowds, and this is a bonus too. I've always had an excellent meal here, so I'd highly recommend it.
