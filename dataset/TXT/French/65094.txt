TmWz4ZvsNgXj_VMPw6G21w If you want to pay a moderate amount for fancy food this is the place to go. The space is nicely decorated but it is a small venue so you sit very close to other guests and it gets pretty loud. I only ordered a main course and I felt uncomfortable with how the waiters reacted when I declined any drinks, apps, or dessert. The food is hit or miss. Some plates are flavorful while others are a bit too bland. In my opinion, this eatery requires a more refined palate and deeper pockets.
