A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g This review is for the French macarons only. I'm on the search for the perfect macaron (my opinion of what a macaron should be, may differ from others). My search will continue. I want a light as air, crispy, thin shell, a slightly chewy middle and the perfect amount of filling. We tried almost all the flavors. Some almost had what I was looking for, others were too dense with no light crisp. Too much filling and too sweet for my liking as well. They were good, just not great.
