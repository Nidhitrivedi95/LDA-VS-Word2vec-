tCSlpwJQ4CZsUEMZeH2SFg I really enjoyed my crab cakes benedict here and the shrimp crepes looked fabulous as well.

It was super-busy on a Friday at lunchtime with a 45-min wait!  Luckily I was able to snag some bar seats that you can seat yourself.  The lovely girl behind the bar was swamped as she was the only one working behind the bar at that time taking care of 20 customers at the counter, plus walk-up/take-out customers as well as making beverages for the table servers.  She took good care of us though and with a smile.

The restaurant itself is very tastefully decorated with some delicious breakfast, brunch, lunch and dinner options.

I definitely would call ahead for reservations in the future and not chance the long wait.  The parking lot fills up very quickly as well, but there is parking at whole foods lot (if you're lucky) or around the Hampton Hotel or the other Phillips Place business.  There is a stair up to the restaurant from Phillips Place, so it's easy to get to if that's where you park.
