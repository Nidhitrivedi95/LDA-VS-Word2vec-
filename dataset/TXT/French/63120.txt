SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA I was in the city for business and was looking for a good place to eat. I was recommended to try this place from my barber. The place was pretty out of the way, so I was a bit hesitant at first since I did not have access to a GPS or my phone maps, but I decided to check it out anyway.

L'Albatros has a fantastic decor and amazing food. I ordered the duck confit and the L'Albatros (drink). Both were made very well. The duck was very smooth and would melt off the bone. Definitely one of the best duck dishes I've had in a while. The drink was also quite interesting since it combined absinthe, mint and some other ingredients. It was made quite well, and was quite smooth even though it had absinthe in it.

Overall, L'Albatros is a must try here in Cleveland.
