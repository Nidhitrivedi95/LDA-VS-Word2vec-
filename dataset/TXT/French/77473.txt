YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g Oh, my!  I would definitely want Hubert Keller preparing my last meal!
This was the restaurant we chose to wrap up the trip and it was our "get dolled up and splurge" night.  We couldn't have chosen a better place.  The service, food, and wine were impeccable which made a thoroughly enjoyable and memorable evening.

Service was perfect, but I expect nothing less when throwing down hundreds for dinner for two.  Yes, this place is spendy, but between the food, service, and ambiance, it's an evening you'll never forget.

We started with the Foie Gras.  I know it's not PC. And, it's probably best for my health that California has banned it.  But, this particular preparation of Foie Gras with the reduction and the brioche was a delectable balance of silky, crunchy, sweet, and salty that bordered on divine. The Roasted Baby Beets were a feast for the eyes and the beets looked like jewels glistening on the plate.  We had to try the Fleur Burger- Wagyu Beef, foie gras, AND truffles?? What's not to love?!?  The Green Papaya Carpaccio of Wagyu Beef with toasted peanuts and thai chilies was also excellent. We had an absolutely amazing bottle of Cabernet with our meal which just made everything come together perfectly.

Also, we had the chocolate souffle and I'm thinking dessert is not their strong suit.  But, there are pages of delicious small plates from all over the world which more than compensate for the dessert.  I would absolutely go back!
