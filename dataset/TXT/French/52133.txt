pmrHuQiy25xKB86tbOLBlA Good service & food in Matthews. I ate dinner there and while it was traditional food, the quality was
excellent!  Great service too!  I had the orzo pasta with shrimp, nice saffron sauce, mild flavor. We shared the greens & beet salad. It was tasty but a little small to share.  I think the prices are reflective of the fancy atmosphere for downtown Matthews.
My pasta was $21 and only had five or six shrimp so I think it was good food but should include more shrimp. The bread was tasty and nice olive oil dip. Also they have a nice selection of wine. The wine specials were a good price, I liked the Pinot Grigio.  I parked across the way at the street parking.
