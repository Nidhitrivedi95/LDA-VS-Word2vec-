EEIz44ewHhOKmfTloAK13g We sat at the chefs table and the dishes were very creative and tasty (which is not easy to find the combination of the two). The only thing is when we called for reservation, the person who answered the phone said the only table we could have would be chefs table. However, when we arrived at the restaurant, we were told "chefs table" is more expensive than regular salon, which surprised us a little as no one has mentioned it at all. 

I also thought it was a bit expensive, nut the overall experience was great!
