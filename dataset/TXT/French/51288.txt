P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ My girlfriends and I came to celebrate my belated birthday dinner, and we made reservations a month in advance for 7:00pm on a Saturday night. The food is 4-5 stars since it was beautifully presented and delicious, but everything was too rich and heavy. Although we barely touched the bread, the food was so rich we had to skip the cheese course (which they did not offer to let us take it to go, nor give us any sort of credit on the bill) and also have them pack up most of the beef course and desserts. We opted for the Guy Savoy Signature Menu ($258/person):

-We started off with 2 amouse bouche (#1 [Foie Gras, Black Truffle, Brioche]-http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/guy-savoy-las-vegas-2?select=mOfykTLIShmKdrJrF-L-Hw#mOfykTLIShmKdrJrF-L-Hw) (#2- [Parmesan Waffle] http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/guy-savoy-las-vegas-2?select=mOfykTLIShmKdrJrF-L-Hw#gLZ6BbWeR0-rZCtO-k04LQ) which were both tasty bites. 
-Complimentary Bread (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/guy-savoy-las-vegas-2?select=mOfykTLIShmKdrJrF-L-Hw#R-SOvF1NdbNDowDJFU4xxg): Good, but save your room for the breads from the bread cart.
-The Amazing Bread Cart (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/guy-savoy-las-vegas-2?select=mOfykTLIShmKdrJrF-L-Hw#bMb2ef0UOjV37x2piIP9pg): There are SO many different breads to try, it makes your head spin! I loved the presentation of the bread cart, and epi, brioche, and olive bread were my favorites.
-Amouse Bouche #3 (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/guy-savoy-las-vegas-2?select=mOfykTLIShmKdrJrF-L-Hw#52RnirBZb00sT_dZz3sqrg) & #4 (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/guy-savoy-las-vegas-2?select=mOfykTLIShmKdrJrF-L-Hw#Zqw1BjDxbs8YsiKxuaqrkg): I can't remember exactly what each was, but remember them being good.
-"Colors of Caviar" (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/guy-savoy-las-vegas-2?select=mOfykTLIShmKdrJrF-L-Hw#fxUn9wMgttCCevpy36L3-g, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/guy-savoy-las-vegas-2?select=mOfykTLIShmKdrJrF-L-Hw#os2fiC_FYTfgGXZOVgmw9A): Amazing- I wish they served this dish for multiple courses. I loved the slightly briny taste of the caviar paired with the rich cream.
-Egg Black Truffle (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/guy-savoy-las-vegas-2?select=mOfykTLIShmKdrJrF-L-Hw#EXLSPvKcOOQyp-FjSuDNLw): This was very good, but also very rich, thick, and creamy. 
-Red Mullet Fillet, Spinach & Mushroom Gratin (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/guy-savoy-las-vegas-2?select=mOfykTLIShmKdrJrF-L-Hw#1v6DisjKIJ0-Ze3nV-SBIQ): Delicious- I loved the sear on the fish, and it was cooked perfectly. It paired well with the gratin, although I wish the fish wasn't served in the sauce since the bottom was soggy.
-Foie-Gras "Bitter Infusion" (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/guy-savoy-las-vegas-2?select=mOfykTLIShmKdrJrF-L-Hw#roQo1jPF9E-myTDysIggTA): 
-Artichoke & Black Truffle Soup, Toasted Mushroom Brioche, Black Truffle Butter (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/guy-savoy-las-vegas-2?select=mOfykTLIShmKdrJrF-L-Hw#80ue9QPrYgTUhRdYUlFEpw): This soup was flavorful, but really heavy- you could taste the butter and cream in it. I wish a clear broth had been served instead.
-American Prime Beef Tenderloin, Carrot Paleron Cannelloni (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/guy-savoy-las-vegas-2?select=mOfykTLIShmKdrJrF-L-Hw#mv6jzFQbG8iOjrKMzkvvSQ): Amazing. The beef tenderloin had a perfect sear on the outside, but was tender on the inside- a perfect medium rare. 
-Coconut "Six Ways" (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/guy-savoy-las-vegas-2?select=mOfykTLIShmKdrJrF-L-Hw#a2ZXU2DUfxeik8AoHxLUlQ): We all loved this dessert- it was really refreshing, and had great coconut flavor.
-Chocolate Fondant, Crunchy Praline, Chicory Cream (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/guy-savoy-las-vegas-2?select=mOfykTLIShmKdrJrF-L-Hw#BvHBZ5H4YTdXUOLorpTj5w): Very rich and chocolately.
-Mignardises Cart (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/guy-savoy-las-vegas-2?select=mOfykTLIShmKdrJrF-L-Hw#8tc_yaXDzqF5bYpFZgI9Sw): The items looked so tasty, but we were so full that we couldn't eat another bite at this point. Our server said he would package some items for us, but they ended up forgetting, which was disappointing.

The best part about dining at Guy Savoy is the service, which was impeccable. Everyone that we spoke to was warm and accommodating, and I wish the menu was more to our tastes (less rich foods, more vegetables). I actually got a stomachache the next day from this meal, since the dishes were so rich, which never happens. However, my friends and I were still happy that we got a mini tour of the kitchen, and that we got to meet Chef Mathieu Chartron. I don't think I would come back for the price unless the menu was drastically different, but would recommend you come at least once if you're a lover of French food. The meal takes about 2.5-3 hours, but if you let them know ahead of time that you need to be out by a certain time, they definitely try their best to accommodate.
