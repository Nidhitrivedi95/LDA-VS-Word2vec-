uTCOEqjuVAXUOzti5TWj2Q So curl my toes with another one of your crêpes as The Crêpe Club is quaint, friendly & delicious (my sister's new fave place).  A crêpe: type of very thin pancake (French origin, deriving from the Latin crispa, meaning "curled"). 

My sister was craving crêpes & asked me to find her a place to go. Of course I checked YELP lol & read their reviews. Some of the reviews on this place are from their temporary other location but still within the Biltmore Fashion Park with their now newer location is next to Williams & Sonoma and is quite charming & adorable. 

She went on a date there since I had to go to work for a couple of hours & loved it so much that she had to share with me & her daughter. She ended up going twice in one day haha. 

She really enjoyed the Caprese (mozzarella, basil pesto tomatoes) & Strawberry 'ShortCrepe' (fresh strawberries, Biscoff crumbles, whipped cream).  Also, got a coconut cupcake & macarons. 

We tried S'Mores Nutella (Nutella, marshmallows, Biscoff crumbles) & Strawberry 'ShortCrepe' with 'cold brew' coffee later.  Everything was deliciously sweet & decadent with very nice staff & owner. 

They have Savory & Sweet Crêpes (w/additional add-ons if you wish), quiches, Acai bowl, baked goods, French toast, paninis, sandwiches, salads, pressed juices, shakes & other drinks avail.
