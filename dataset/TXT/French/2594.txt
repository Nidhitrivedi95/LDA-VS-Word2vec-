0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g Still the place I consider for comparing to other fine dining restaurants. Food here is more than just a meal, it's more of an experience. Service here is tremendous. Decor is extremely nice(think Museum) along with the view of the water fountains(if you are so lucky).  Go with the Prix-Fixe Menu and be prepared for the best 2-3 hours of your life.
