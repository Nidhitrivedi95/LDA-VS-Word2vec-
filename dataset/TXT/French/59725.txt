S5gtq6g6dIfyaFvyPYyzkg Been to the Dome many times so we decided to go there for our girlie Christmas lunch. 

We could book but thought it wouldn't be an issue. We turned up at 12pm and waited an hour before we reached the Maître D. They asked how many was in our party (5 inc little baby) and we were asked to wait at the bar. Another 40 minutes passed so we asked how much longer our table was going to be. The Maitre D snapped at us and walked off. 

Another 30 minutes later we were show to our table. We ordered drinks and two courses and shortly before our starters arrived, a card was sat on our table saying they need it back in 60 minutes (this was due to people wanting to drink at the bar at 4pm). No one told us this when we were placed at our table and if they had, we would have asked for a table at the back of the room.  

Eventually, the mains arrived.. so much for the promise of hand cut chips.. Frozen chips all round! 

The waiting staff rushed us and removed plates from the table before the whole table was finished eating. We still had time so we ordered coffees and desserts. They had just brought these to the table when our "lovely" waitress informed us that we had 6 minutes. She then placed the bill on our table (we hadn't asked for it).

We were still drinking coffee when she returned as asked us to move - as we were nearly finished we asked for another few minutes to finish. The manager then came over and harassed us to move. At this point, we had had enough and left. The five of us paid £150 exc drinks for lunch so not a cheap day out and to be treated with such disdain by not just one member of staff but three inc Manager was the last straw. We will not be back.
