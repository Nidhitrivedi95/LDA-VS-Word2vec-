9ET_RUNztevq4_OLAX80Gg When I was in Vegas a few years ago, I hit one of Daniel Boulud's restaurants and really enjoyed it. But after the initial word was so negative for Cafe Boulud, I wasn't in any rush to give this place a try.

The renovations and retooling brought a new wave of positive notices, so the time was right to give the restaurant a try. I arrived on a Satuday at around noon and was immediately seated and given a glass of water.

I wanted to start off with a cocktail but decided against it after noticing they're around $16 each. So I just ordered the Boudin Blanc as my main. The dish is advertised thusly: "white sausage, caramelized onions, apple, mashed potatoes."

This is an exceptionally rich plate of food. The sausage is delicate and delicious, while the mashed potatoes are almost unreasonably creamy. (I shudder to think how much butter and cream is in them.) The slices of raw apple don't seem to add much, however, but there are also caramelized apples and onions and they're delicious.

The service was decent, although my water glass stood empty for a few minutes longer than I would've liked. And as tasty as the dish was, $24 just seems a little outrageous. Still, I would return to try other items on the menu were I to come into a lot of money.
