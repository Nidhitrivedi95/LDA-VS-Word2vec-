Made two visits to Frank's Kitchen. Both were fantastic.

Visit #1 - Had the Rack of Lamb. Has to be #1 on my list for best lamb dishes.

Visit #2 - Did the Chef's Tasting. AMAZING. Every dish was so thoughtful and detailed in both taste and presentation. It's definitely a little pricey, but worth the price for a very special meal.
