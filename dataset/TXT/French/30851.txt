fyJAqmweGm8VXnpU4CWGNw I came here not long after they opened and I got 4 assorted macarons and a crème brulee.  

We've never had macarons at our house before and were perplexed by the flavors of the macarons; we thought at least two of them were savory (a green one and a tan one) as they had a surprising lack of sweetness.  But I am the first to admit that I'm not at all familiar with macarons and their flavors, I guess I'm not sure what they were supposed to taste like, but the savory taste of the two surprised us and not in a good way. 

On the other hand, the crème brulee was amazing, absolutely perfect.  The French Grocery itself was cute and I liked the open format so you could see into the kitchen.  

It's worth mentioning that the ordering process was a little awkward (for me) as the customer right in front of me was carrying on a personal conversation with the employee who had rung up our purchases and I felt a little like an intruder on their private discussion as I stood there with my macarons in hand and waited for them to caramelize my crème brulee in the kitchen...awkward.
