gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA Oh yeah...another Michelin star restaurant added to my book. We were a pretty big party of 11 including our kids venturing into the fine dining experience. This time it's Alize in Las Vegas at the top of the Palms hotel. First of all let me start by stating that I ordered the chef's 7 course tasting menu which is the basis of my five stars...had i only ordered certain a-la-carte items my rating might have been different, such as the Chilean Sea Bass which I would have preferred to have had a nice crispy skin and a lot less sauce/broth and what ever else was swimming around in it. This is one of my favorite choices of fish, I wish they would've kept the dish a little more simple. Also, the pork belly, though it was tasty and tender, I felt was nothing too special. Now, with that said, the tasting menu was great! Everything from the lobster bisque, and NO, it's nothing like the bisque one gets at Red Lobster...to think so shows just how uncouth you are, to the King Crab wth Black Truffles tucked in between the meat, to the Rib-eye that was soo tender and flavorful and of course, drumroll please..the Foie Gras. Whomever banned this stuff from California should have their taste buds hung. The generous amounts of Black Truffles and good portions of Foie Gras all contributed to a great dinner. I've come to the realization that just because a place has a Michelin star does not mean the food is automatically good and memorable, this is one of those places that got it right...at least with the tasting menu items anyway.
