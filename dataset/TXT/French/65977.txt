udFcIcbWbxrO8uLF95WnQg Came back here for bf's 26th birthday. 

Omg. Loved it. Like all the Zack Bruell restaurants, they let you bring wine, so I was pretty happy wining during dinner.

Service again was attentive, although really slow. Wasn't in a rush, so it didn't bother me too much.

Appetizers:
- Seafood dumplings (this came as a recommendation from our waitress); normally we wouldn't order this as bf is not a big seafood fan, but we were both so so so glad that we got this. I would come back just for this. SO flavorful. I loved the sourness from the sauerkraut on the bottom of the dish. Love love love this. 
- Crispy pork stack (again); not as much flavor as I was expecting, but still decent - maybe because it was after I ate the seafood dumplings. 

Entrees:
- Crispy pork shank; LOVE this dish too. This was amazing. The crispy skin on the outside with just a big of fat in every bite. The flavor was amazing. I would come back just for this as well.
- Veal with risotto; this was not as good as the crispy pork shank. Less flavorful. Meat was really tender though. Probably would not get this again.

Dessert:
Chocolate mousse; good, chocolatey. 

Why 5 stars? The seafood dumplings and crispy pork shank alone makes me forget about the other dishes. Would love to come back to try happy hour next time.
