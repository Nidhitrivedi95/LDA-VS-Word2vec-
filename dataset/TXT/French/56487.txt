rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A We went for brunch and everything was delicious! We had shrimp and grits, omelet of the day and the spice donuts. The donuts came with Nutella and blackberry jam. The bread that came out with most delicious butter and strawberry jam. Very delicious. The food is as good as 5 years ago will definitely come back.
