4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Looked for a unique Vegas dining experience and made our way to this popular French Bistro. We chose to sit outside which was comfortable on a cold chilly evening thanks to the numerous heaters that were working in full force. When you sit outside you are treated to periodic water show from the Bellagio. 
Your dinner is started with a warm French baguette that is delightful. On our night we were treated to a complimentary sliced carrot appetizer that was surprisingly good. We paired our starters with the "French Kiss" martini which was nice, even without the tongue. We ordered a French Bordeaux to pair with our dinners. The Bordeaux wines hover around $70 a bottle. 
For dinner we sought the help of our French waiter for his recommendation. We were splitting so we asked should we have the French Onion Soup or the dinner scallops! He recommended we go with the scallops, though the soup sounds tasty. Then we said choose one of the Steaks for us off of the list of numerous (approximately 10) different steak dishes. He chose a cut of Filet Mignon. 
The filet comes with "French fries" but they are the after thought on the dish as the filet can be cut with a butter knife and melts in your mouth. Speaking of melting in your mouth the scallops were a delicious butter that were delicious. 

If you can't get over to France anytime soon, you could hit the Paris in Vegas and eat at Mon Ami Gabi for a little taste of France.
