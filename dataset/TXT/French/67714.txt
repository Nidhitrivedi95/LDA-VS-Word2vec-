UxWH8zRYIBgs6Q2oykvRdw Our experience at Cluny's was great. I was with a group of people and it was my husband's birthday. It looks great inside and the person that served us was quite pleasant. The food was great, we all enjoyed our dishes. My favourite was the Cod fish donuts, yum! The cocktail drinks were also a hit with our group as they were tasty and reasonably priced. It was a very memorable experience, we keep talking about going back.
