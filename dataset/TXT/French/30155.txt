FRuuIDOd21pTJHvEGIt1Gg Our NYE dinner...amazing service! It seemed like a choreographed event with severs dropping in and out from our table, seamlessly. This was with 2 young children mind you. We went as a recommendation before the big party at Old Port and we were not disappointed. The food was delicious...just enough French for these Chicagoans.
