sphMzEIqY1I2Dzv3zLZY2g I have been to Global on multiple occasions such as Restaurant Week, New Year's, Special Night on the town and EVERYTIME the food has been fantastic.  The menu is always seasonal with local farm fresh produce.  I don't understand some of the reviews on Google questioning location? Many (myself included) take pride when they find a hidden gem in the neighborhood and are able to tell friends about the great food...it seems like this "word of mouth" marketing is working because the restaurant was packed the last time visited on New Year's. In my opinion this is one of the best restaurants in all of Charlotte.
