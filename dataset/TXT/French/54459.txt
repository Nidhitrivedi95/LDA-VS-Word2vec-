rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw Thank you BARDOT for such an amazing dining experience. You definitely helped make my birthday a memorable one!

I had been wanting to come here for a while, and my bf actually made reservations for us to eat here on my birthday. Everyone was extremely friendly and even wished me a happy birthday. We both had And God Created Woman, which I believe is named after the 50's French film. It was delicious. Just slightly sweet with citrus flavors that went well with the gin. Our server described it perfectly especially with the foam on top. We decided to start off our dinner with a cheese plate and oysters. The oysters were delicious and refreshing and the cheese plate, absolute perfection. We got the Blue cheese, goat cheese and the monks cheese. All of which were delicious!

We then ordered the caramelized goat cheese and beet salad, as well as the French onion soup. My bf wasn't too fond of the beet salad for the specific reason that he isn't too fond of beets (he ordered the salad), I thought it was delicious. I on the other hand bought the onion soup was good, but I felt like the cheese didn't melt properly. 

For our main entrees, my bf got the pork chop, and I the gnocchi. The pork chop was supposedly fantastic, as he described it as really smoky bacon and enjoyed every bite. The gnocchi is not going to be what you expect. It is a very creamy dish with the triple creme wedges, butter soft, and very large gnocchi's. I personally thought it was a little too hearty for me, but it was still delicious

Dessert was finished nicely as my bf surprised me with a macaron with "Happy Birthday" written on the plate. The portions here are quite large for a French restaurant, and you definitely feel like you got the most of your meal. The staff is very friendly, I would recommend coming here at least once if you are able to
