hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA The Baguette Cafe doesn't necessarily scream French Cafe at you when first walking through the doors but their food definitely does. It was hard to choose a favorite thing but if I had to, I'd go with the vanilla cream and chocolate twist. So creamy, so good, with the right crispy buttery-ness. It was so tasty, I had to order a few more to go. It has busy moments but you'll mostly be able to find a table. And my partner and I bookmarked it for future visits.
