9n6BBipidP5Eyb9xGrS0Ww I'll let you in on a little secret: I love crepes! Sweet and savory, both. I knew I would hate myself if I left Montreal (the closest I've yet to get to true Parisian culture) without trying one of each. This breakfast checked the "Try a savory crepe" box!

Gluten free, organic and local. The owner was very nice and chatted while we were deciding. The menu isn't huge. IMO, I like the more refined, focused  choices that were offered. They have both savory and sweet. And, don't worry, if nothing jumps out at you, there's always the option to create your own crepe. 

I picked the smoked salmon savory crepe: smoked salmon, spinach, creamy goat cheese and a fresh lemon wedge. Interesting crepe - much more crunchy than a thin pancake. Buckwheat is used in place of flour. The salmon was wonderful. And the sprouts as a garnish was so cute. Crisp and fresh. 

My mother got the traditional egg/ham/Swiss/spinach crepe. Tried a bite, and yep, also very good. 

The crepes were served pipping hot fresh off the stove. Good flavors. Great price. Giant portions. The gluten free crepe was a new addition to our tastebuds! Great spot to catch a breather, while walking the rows of market vendors.
