SCklYa_jhihWAcfIn-_chg On Sundays Bonjour Brioche is packed. The food was good and the amount of the food was okay. I would have preferred that the food were a bit bigger. The food was of good quality and was fresh. The restaurant itself is also a French bakery with many freshly baked goods. The decor inside also has its charm which creates a good ambiance. The price on their menu was reasonable, however the food took a very long time to arrive. The waitress came by many times to refill our coffees, which was appreciated.  I would have given their breakfast brunch 4 stars but I have to take a star off for their cash only policy. We arrived at the restaurant without enough cash so one of us had to run to a bank to withdraw cash. We don't need a workout before breakfast is served!
