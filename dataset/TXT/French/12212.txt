4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I had dinner at Mon Ami Gabi over the weekend, and everything was great. We got stuck in traffic, so we were late for our reservation, but they fit us in without waiting anyway. (And on a holiday weekend)

The food was fantastic and the service is impeccable. I highly recommend the lemon basil ginger martini. Yum!
