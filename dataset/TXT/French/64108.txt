tCp1OkefhamXLeTnmEPUow Great place!

I've been there twice for brunch. It is pretty standard French brunch food with omelets,  crepes, croissants etc... 

The potatoes they served as a side were magnificent and seasoned to perfection. Great terrace outside in the summer.

Admittedly it is pricey but it's worth the extra money. It can be a bit slow compared to cheaper brunch places like Cora but it is something to be expected in more high end places where they hopefully don't reheat dishes.

I might go again in the future for lunch or supper, it's a nice and cozy place.
