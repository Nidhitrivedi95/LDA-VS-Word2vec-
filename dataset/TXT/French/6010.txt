3rj1qpgFvkRWtAka17mhEQ I came here with my family and was pleasantly surprised with the fish&chips. We also had the French onion soup which is always awesome.  The food is always pretty close to home cooking as your gonna get.  Jessica our server was great , not much of a happy birthday singer BUT great service thanks Jessica and Mimi's for a great experience
