4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Wife and I arrived about 30 minutes prior to our 10:00 am Saturday reservation and asked for patio seating.  Wait was 10 minutes and we were seated outside on a bright, cool October morning.  Tables there are very close together, so be prepared to overhear conversations on each side.

Our food was delicious, well-prepared, and service was excellent.  Started off with the fruit bouquet served in an artfully crafted standing cantaloupe with sides of mint and cream.  Wife had a good sized mushroom omelet and juice which she says was one of the best she has had.  I had a light, fluffy waffle with blueberry compote and whipped cream on the side.  Quality was outstanding, as was the service from our personable waitperson.   Coffee refills come without prompting.

It was a nice experience and we'll definitely be going back on our next trip, although we will most likely ask for inside terrace seating to avoid the close quarters on the patio.
