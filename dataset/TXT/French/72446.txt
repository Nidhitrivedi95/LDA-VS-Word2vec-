XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q The restaurant and decor is absolutely  gorgeous! We used the complimentary limo service which came to our hotel to pick us up and take us to the MGM. This was nice. Now for the food. I've dined at many Michelin Star restaurants all over the world. I understand this restaurant received 3 stars back in 2009 but it hasn't been rated since Vegas is no longer part of that Michelin rated guide. So since I didn't dine here in 2009, perhaps it was better back then. The food was above average but not exceptional. Like I said, maybe the quality has gotten worse. The stand out entree was the spaghetti with uni and caviar. But really, if you put caviar and uni on anything it will taste delicious. Not that innovating. So wasn't super blown away here. They had a nice bread cart with a very good variety of bread and a special butter that was imported which was pretty good. I consider the bread cart an entree and was a nice  since it's pushed around on a cart and you have soo many to choose from. They also have a huge dessert cart at the end of dinner. This was really nice. Service was ok. The servers were a bit stiff and robotic besides the guy who was pushing around the bread and dessert cart and refilling our water. Overall, this restaurant excels on presentation. But the food, for the price and service. Not worth it. My favorite entree is usually dessert so I was very excited to eat . I ordered this pear with a chocolate dome dessert and it was DISGUSTING!! I was soo disappointed I wanted to send it back to the kitchen but I held it in. Luckily, they had dessert cart otherwise I would have been extremely upset. have I would suggest going to French Laundry instead. Thomas Keller's dishes are way more fresh and innovative than this place. The entrees/desserts at French Laundry were AHH-MAZZING and more unique. don't waste you money going here. There are far better places.
