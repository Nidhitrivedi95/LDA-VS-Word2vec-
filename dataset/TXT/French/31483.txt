gjCmXkMNVE0JSk8puUwv6g By far my new fav restaurant! Impeccable service and the food is to die for. I really like that they have many vegan/vegetarian options. The goat cheese tartine, sweet peas & carrots, cabbage/lentil salad, macaroon, and exotic fruits dessert was so delicious my mouth is watering just thinking about it! I'm looking forward to going back to try other items very soon!
