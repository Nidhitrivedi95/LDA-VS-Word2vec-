SFnrHuVFSNiondFVUBLJZQ This place is terrible not sure how the reviews are so good. 6 of us came and all got different dessert crepes and they were all bad.  Aside from the crepes being ice cold the ice cream was awful.  How the hell do you mess up ice cream.  It tasted terrible and the texture was way off. Worst crepe Suzette I've ever had in my life.  The crepes aside from being frozen we're probably 3x as thick as a crepe should be. The only redeeming quality of this place is that the staff was very friendly.  Tourist Trap, STAY AWAY!
