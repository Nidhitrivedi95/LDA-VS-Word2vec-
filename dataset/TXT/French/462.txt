-Mz3M0g6iFZczs6a7ddf5g On a quiet street in Montreal lies this gem that you would never know exists if walking by. Housed in a warehouse looking building and behind a mysterious black door, Le Serpent is a ultra modern restaurant that serves up some great food and offers an excellent wine selection.

I came on a Tuesday evening and dined at the bar because, well the bar is the best seat in any restaurant. Grabbed a few glasses of wine and then got the run down on the menu from the bartender. 

For my meal I had risotto and linguini. The risotto was very good and the linguini was delicious. The portions were a little on the small side, but the meals themselves were excellent. The other stand out, which kind of freaked me out a bit, was the fact that the meals were prepared and served in less than five minutes after I ordered. It was to the point where I had to ask if the food was already pre-made, to which the server replied that the chefs are just that good. Very impressive! 

All in all a great restaurant in a city that is overflowing with great dining options.
