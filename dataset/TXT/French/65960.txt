It's been weeks since I ate there, but my mouth still starts to salivate when I think of the stuffed tofu entree. Simply divine! And the service was exceptional to boot! The staff was extremely knowledgable about the menu and the chef was even able to accomodate a non-traditional vegan dessert (beyond their standard sorbet). Truly a wonderful experience with trendy atmosphere that didn't come off as stuffy. Great spot to stop in before or after a show in the theatre district.
