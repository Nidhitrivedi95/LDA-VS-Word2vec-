XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q For our last night in Vegas, Husband decided to really splurge and get us a table at Joel Robuchon.  We had the concierge get us day of reservations and they were very accommodating.  We had the full pre fix menu of 12 courses and it was all amazing.  The staff was very knowledgeable, friendly and not stuffy.
We were seated on the "outdoor" patio looking into the rest of the restaurant with no one else to share it.  So romantic.
The bread cart was stunning, I was floored by the selection, but since it was going to be a 3 hour dinner I had to hold back. The wine bible was amazing, I've never seen so much in one place.
Every course came with a brief description and services was impeccable.  Our waiter was great, friendly and easy going.
We had a herb tea cart and had fresh brewed peppermint tea which delightful.
Desert was amazing, we were too full to take advantage of the candy cart.
At the end they presented Husband with a raspberry meringue cake-let what a surprise that was.
Finally as a "gift" we received a copy of the menu, a book with images of dishes and a yummy little pound cake to take home.

We couldn't have been more please with out last night in Vegas.
