t1mR_Zff6Dqv1TueE2JLEA Went last light June 24th and thought we'd try something different. The atmosphere sounded inviting and I'm no stranger to Moroccan cuisine 
Well, that was a cutesy however a poor attempt at a themed restaurant. 
Where do I begin? 
It has all the trapping a tourist and no offence but one which little cultural experience may appreciate. 
The food was awful, and the a 1/2 bottle of a Pinot Grigio was that undrinkable. 
Ok so maybe it's the belly dancing entertainment ? Nope two ladies one was ok the other completely inexperienced. 
Oh well its for the tourists but desert can't be bad. 
I had the chocolate tart - via a vis Presidents choice frozen deserts . But the kicker was the Baklava I wondered if it was made in house and our waiter told it was a third party desert. Mmmm I say this without exaggerating. - this was the worst Baklava I have ever seen. Dry hard tasteless really unreal how they could serve it. The waiter suggested we should have exotic dishes we don't get at home well I've amazing Baklava from the Persian and Middle East bakeries her and in the Mid East and this was too much. The straw that broke the camels back. 
We would  never return to this restaurant and given the cost 55 x2 prix fixe and 22$ 1/2 bottle with tax and gratuities 150 approx. 
not recommended. Such wasted potential..
