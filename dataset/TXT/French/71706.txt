xeFVRUjxorxjO_qjX8FNdw Great food- we ordered the chicken tarragon crepe which was absolutely delicious. The cream was so tasty. My son had the chicken flat bread. The cheese they use is cheddar on top ( would've like mozzarella) and the vegetables were too big to bite on specially for a 4 year old . The dough was pretty tasty . Not the traditional flat bread but nice for a change.
