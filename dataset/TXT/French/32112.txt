gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA We recently went to Alize. We had just come in after a long flight, and wanted a place that was both rated high and yet was close to our hotel (Palms).  Alize looked perfect, as it is well regarded and is also on top of one of the Palms towers.

Even better, Travel Zoo was offering a $145 for two people dinner special that we decided to purchase.  In fact, they are still offering it.

I am happy to report that Alize exceeded our expectations. 

Our first impression was the superb view.  Palms is a bit off the strip, which is actually a feature not a bug, since the view from Alize gives you a wonderful perspective of the whole strip.

Of course, what really matters is the food.  The tasting menu was a 6 course prixe fixe dinner, where you make a choice from each section (e.g. appetizer, main, dessert).  Every choice we made was excellent.  We particularly liked the Vichyssoise soup, scallops, salmon, duck breast, and Beef Wellington.  Our cocktails were great.

The Vichyssoise soup has a story.  In the middle of eating it, we noticed a piece of hair in it!  We pointed this out to the waiter.  He was immediately apologetic.  A few minutes later, no less than the general manager came out to our table to apologize.  We were comped our cocktails.  No hard feelings on our part.

That story typifies the service as a whole, which was excellent.  Everyone there treated us really well, and seemed sincerely customer oriented.

We would not hesitate to come back.
