5fquJHY2hMX9tPRD5s0t5g Great restaurant!!! Was not expecting it to be so amazing and for the prices it was wonderful with fabulous service! Went there with a girl friend and had drinks. We also split the Mac and cheese - mussels and calamari! The mussels were by far the best deal there for only 11.00 - being able to soak it all up with bread!  The restaurant itself was really beautiful too with old barn wood and metal - gave it a very rustic feel! Will definitely be back and recommending this place to everyone!
