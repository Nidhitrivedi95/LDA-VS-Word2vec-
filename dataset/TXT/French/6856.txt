4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I've wanted to eat here for the longest time! Finally had a chance to come here for breakfast last week when we were in Vegas. There was absolutely no wait at 10:30am on Christmas Eve (yay!) and we were seated outside on the patio. The weather was actually very nice and the heating lamps kept us warm :) For food, we ordered the eggs Florentine and the caramelized apple pancake.

Eggs Florentine: Eggs Benedict with spinach and artichoke. This was very good although nothing too extraordinary.

Caramelized apple pancake: I had no idea that by "big skinny pancake" they meant a delicious big crepe-like pancake! I've never tried anything like this and it was REALLY good. Nice and fluffy with several crepe layers and lots of whipped cream on the side! Highly recommend trying this.

Overall, good food (at least for breakfast) for a decent price! And the best part about sitting on the patio is the beautiful view and the people watching that you can do. Service was also fast and friendly.
