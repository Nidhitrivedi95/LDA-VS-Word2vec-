aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw While continuing my search for the ultimate macaron, I've come to Vegas to taste those palm sized treats I've been seeing on yelp. Since I am such a snob, I always buy 2 macarons first to test them. Bouchon Bakery passed with flying colors...tried the salted caramel and raspberry, eventually bought 5 more (got the 6th FREE).

The macarons ($3.50 ea) are light yet chewy, just the way I like them. The salted caramel filling is a bit chewy too which I like, the raspberry and the rest had the normal frosting type filling. We also tried the chocolate and pistachio flavors but don't think I'd order them again because there was not enough flavor in them.

Went to the Aria to check out the macs at Jean Philippe but they only sold them in pre-packaged boxes of 6. They were also very tiny in size. Didn't even bother, if I can't taste one or two first, I don't partake...yes I am a snob.

Think you'll be happy at Bouchon, the service was kind and helpful...but more importantly, the macs were divine!
