jLxeBgWhLRbII2ACkgH1Sg For our first time here, we loved the atmosphere... Calming cafe music plays in the background of the hustle & bustle of the people and the kitchen. There is indoor and outdoor seating available...A large array of pastries, quiche, breads, & made-to-order Crepes, sandwiches, & specials... 
Prices are reasonable, but it's easy to over order. Everything looks, sounds, & smells so delightful. I ordered the Montmartre crepe which has chicken, Swiss & goat cheese, spinach, and onion-- it was delicious and very filling. Also, my daughter clearly enjoyed her Nutella crepe judging by her empty plate and messy face. 
And we just couldn't pass up the French Macaroons they had--Raspberry, blueberry, & chocolate. Each was vibrant with color, bite-sized, and pack with flavor! 
I can't wait to come back to try something else off the menu. B
