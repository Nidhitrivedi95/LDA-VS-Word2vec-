Tefx_N6A6nrsdj4jHHnbYg Amazing customer service is what really makes this place, I mean other than the decor, the feel and the food. 

The food is fresh and they make it right in front of you which to me is pretty neat because I like to know what goes on when someone is preparing my food. I've tried their turkey apple and Brie sand which and truly enjoyed how fresh all the ingredients were.

Try their lavender cookies, they are pretty amazing, and go well together with their lattes.
