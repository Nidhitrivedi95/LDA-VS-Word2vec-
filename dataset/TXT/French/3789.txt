I've never been a crepe fan...but now I see the light.

A friend of mine suggested this place and I will have to thank him for my happy stomach.
I had the crepe with pesto sauce and ham and have to say that it was truly wonderful.  Learned while I was there that all the flower is imported from France (where the chef is actually from) and is gluten free.  Truly incredible!  Fluffy and light (two adjectives that shouldn't go together but when they do...magic).

Highly recommend this place.  My only complaint is that it isn't closer to me :)
