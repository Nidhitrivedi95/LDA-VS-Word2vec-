4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw This was a decent meal, but I give it 3 stars instead of 2 simply for the excellent service. The food wasn't great -- two of us had to send our steaks back because they were cooked improperly. If you order medium rare, you get almost well, and if you order well, you get a burnt piece of meat. 

I don't think I'd come back again because it's expensive for what you actually get. It's a decent meal, but it should be a great meal.
