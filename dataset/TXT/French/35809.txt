hvjgF-vnPw2jyL5DBuB0qg A definite must for those in the area.  The service was good, drinks better, food incredible.
Had the 2 special cocktails for the night.  There was a sweet and refreshing pear and maple syrup cocktail w/ vodka as the base.  The other was basically a giant bloody mary garnished w/ beef jerky covered in horseradish sauce and pickles.  Not really a bloody mary fan, but the tomato juice wasn't overpowering and it wasn't too salty, so I didn't mind helping finish it off.  The beef jerky garnish didn't really do much for me, really salty, but I guess in a place like this, you can't just be serving up the standard bloody mary that the plebians drink.
Started off with the Octopus, fingerlings, creme fraiche and chorizo.  The octopus was prepared soft and tender, not the usually chewiness you associate with it.  The creme fraiche added the slightest hint of sweetness to the dish.  A few celery leaves balanced out the experience.
The main course was a seafood risotto and scallops w/ bacon, buttercup squash, and black truffle.
The shrimp was plump and tender, with the risotto being cooked al dente.  The fried calimari that topped it off was amazing.  So light and flavorful.
Scallops were cooked perfectly, which is a rarity.  You usually either get something that's cook too much or too little, which ends up being too chewy or raw and ruins the dish, but not here.
Capped off the night with a couple desserts, affogato w/ grand marnier and financier topped off w/ pistachio ice cream.  I'm not gonna even bother w/ a description, it was good.
Bottom line, you can't go wrong.  The food, drinks, service, ambiance, were al great.
