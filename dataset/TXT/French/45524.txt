mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q Over hyped.
Amuse bouche - Grapefruit Gelee with avocado = funky weird lame
King Crab Salad with mozzarella, Parmesan avocado tomatoes 0 Crab was perfectly cooked and seasoned, lettuce had a super weak vinaigrette on it was boring
Langoustine fritter-  Crispy, light good combo with the greens and pesto paste - Very good but not amazing
Le Caille - Foie stuffed quail - Excellent combo with truffle mash all came together great was awesome Best dish of the night  by far. Only thing that all night that really was impressive everything else i could have easily recreated myself and made them more flavorful 
Foie Gras Burger - Red pepper sauce - Was great but of course it is no shocker here was definitely tasty
Le Onglet - beef tar tar  40.00 beef tartar are u F'in kidding me this was so basic and traditional.. EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING of course was good but come on Chef of the Century etc dude show me something new!!! so lame..
Dessert Lemon Partfait w puffed rice etc.. WAS THE BOMB. Mind blowing dessert !!! Pastry was only dish that was revelutionary mind blowing goodness i expected from more course.

Overall Service TERRIBLE!! Michelin star??? U kidding me???  counter service.. That didn't do anything wrong but was so not impressive. When I say terrible I am just comparing it to the price and expectations of a world class restaurant.. Michelin obviously just gave him a star for being french.. 
Water went empty a couple times, mis marked the table with share plates when the kitchen split for us, Never offered us cocktail or Vin. Weird.. Suggestion was lame. Spiel was too fast not clear.

Restaurant MAJOR OVER HYPE!!!! All food bland nothing amazing except the dessert. Don't blow money here because that's the only thing that will blow you away the price tag for boring food.. I still want to try the mansion but this was nothing special.
