WOd8tWsh2Yt_osHv-ngx_w Universal is an excellent brunch restaurant! My sister and I stopped in around 10AM on a Sunday before heading into Parc Mont-Royal- we definitely needed some food in our bodies before any type of hiking! 

Although I had seen some reviews saying that service was slow, I thought that our waitress was pretty quick and we didn't have any trouble getting her attention. We ordered one big and one small orange juice, and a small coffee was complimentary with my sister's combo meal. 

Food portions were quite large. We ordered:
1. Eggs Benedict with Smoked Salmon: perfect! And came with the fruit bowl. 
2. Sister's combo: I forget which one she had but she got a combo with waffles, Nutella (or some other chocolate hazelnut spread), bananas and strawberries. You should've seen her face of bliss! Even though we had nothing in our stomachs, she still couldn't finish it!

Overall, very good brunch. 4/5.
