She made sure I got nothing but the best: Fresh ground pepper, ketchup, a blueberry muffin she recommended. I never had to ask for a refill. She did all this with a smile the whole time. She would check up on us just to make sure everything was ok. At the end she wrote a nice message on my receipt telling me and my family to have a great night along with a muffin to take home. The experience and the food was amazing. I left her a tip and complimented her. We need more people like her in this world. 

I will DEFINITELY come back
