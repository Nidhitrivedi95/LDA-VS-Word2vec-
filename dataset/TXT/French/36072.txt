Service felt a little slow, however. We sat for a while before ordering and food took a while, which the waiter even commented on and thanked us for not complaining. It also seemed confusing as to who would be serving us at first but for 12:40 on Sunday we got right in with not wait. I will definitely go again and bring my parents along.
