JEXasd9XUHFbt_fIdmdK8g La Banane is both delicious and consistent. 

The seafood platter is my favourite in the city; the fish is fresh and overwhelmingly delicious. The dipping sauces are fantastic, the flavours are exactly what you'd hope for, and every dish is extremely well crafted! 

Wine + Cocktails are both excellent too! 

Highly, highly recommend!
