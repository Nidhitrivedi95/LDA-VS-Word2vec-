pKiSzUlBBRNEdTML24piXA What a pleasant suprise!  Although my husband and I drove by here and didn't want to go in, I talked him into it as I saw a segment on Check Please Arizona.  Cute little cafe which is hidden by the trees, you could miss it.  We sat outside after sitting inside because it was one of those beautiful AZ evenings.  We ordered a bottle do wine and dinner.  Our waiter, Josh was great.  My husband ordered the lamb chops with risotto...I had the mushroom appetizer.  The risotto was so delicious..made with Manchego cheese and chiorzo...what a combination!  My husband loved the lamb, generous portions too.  The sauce that came with the mushrooms was really good.  We will definitely will go back.  We forget how cool it is downtown in those little older areas!
