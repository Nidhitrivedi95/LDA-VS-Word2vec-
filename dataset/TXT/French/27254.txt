dd3GZs6zW2t7BM0cbxAzvg My wife and I are always in search of good French restaurants. Specially the ones that may open till late so that we may go there after theaters, and movies. This is a really impossible desire in Toronto. We are so fortunate to discover La Palette.
Just to add the context, we have previously been to Scaramouche, Didier, Tati, Bistro 990, Loire, and some others. We travel to these establishments from Mississauga.
When I called La Palette, to seek a table for 2 at 10 PM. The call was eagerly and most amicably attended, and I was told that we can certainly come at 10. It seems that La Palette is happy to receive customers till late.
Upon arrival the reception was amicable and warm. One minor discomfort was that we were offered seats near the coat room, in an area which is very chilly due to some kind of persistent draft from some door.  Had to change tables twice, and were lucky that at that  time the restaurant did have some available.
Everything after that was outstanding. 
The server gave us the specials menu, and we did not find it as impressive as their main menu.
We ordered Escargo La Palette, and Riz de Veau to share as appetizers. Pre appetizer bread and olive oil was delicious, we enjoyed the toasted crust very much.
For the main my wife chose the Norwegian Macakarel, and I chose the Duck n Buck.
Every single one of the above orders was fantastic.  For the desert, despite being too full, we ordered the Cloufati which was very light and  great  to end our meal. Even the Cafe Americano was quite perfect. Service was very friendly and non intrusive.
I would say that we will place La Palette just after Scaramouche and Bistro 990 and equal or very close to Loire. It is only because the first two are in a different class due to their locations and market segment. 
One thing is certain: We will go to La Palette again and again till they get fed up with us.
