xcmmTXhuMx2fZF2Bt69F4w Belgium themed restaurant, one of the best places to eat in Pittsburgh. Great beer selection, and the food is great. They are known for their mussels, so try it out( the one with curry is my favorite). The prices are very fair considering the consistent high quality of the food. Service staff are friendly and knowledgeable. Bad thing is they don't take reservations and the place fills up fast. Ample street parking is available.
