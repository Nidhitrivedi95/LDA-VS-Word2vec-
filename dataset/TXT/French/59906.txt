sARavfidmIS878q5BtlyVQ Was enthusiastic to try my first gastronomy experience. I knew it was supposed to be an alternative experience but there were so many factors in basic restaurant 101 that was a fail. 
1) the dishes being prepared in your presence is more like putting pre made dishes onto your plate. 
2) found pieces of plastic in my groups food. No sign of customer service to remedy the poor cleanliness despite our heavy price tag meal
3) most dishes were overly salty for our taste

If you wanted to have your taste of Jose Andres' restaurants, this is one of his weaker displays despite the hype in reservation, space and price. I had 10000x greater eating experience at his casual Bazaar in LA
