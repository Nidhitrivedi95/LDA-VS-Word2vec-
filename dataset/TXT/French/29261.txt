eUjDWzbQ6eLZy0uELEOa9Q I loved the atmosphere of this place. Live music (they played the Beatles...brownie +++ points), awesome food, and good company! What more can you ask for. The2 person booths are really cool, kind of gives you a feeling of having your own little room. Ordered the 10oz black angus striploin and the tea smoked muscovy duck breast...both amazing! Surprised myself by cleaning the plate. You should reserve in advance because it does get quite popular on weeknights. There was outdoor seating but unfortunately it wasn't open when we went. There were also tables on the 2nd floor which I'd like to be next time because that's where the band plays from. Overall, I would love to visit this place again!
