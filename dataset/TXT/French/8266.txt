4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw This place is wonderful, you don't expect to find something that feels this authentic in LV. We had no wait (we sat inside), promptly seated. Our server was a warm and friendly little cutie :)

Their bread is realllllly good, watch out not to fill up. I ordered two apps for my entree, the scallops and the mussels. PERFECT. Seafood was fresh and succulent, the glass of chard I had to accompany was really lovely too. The atmosphere feels cozy like a french bistro even though it's enormous. I really liked this place, would definitely return :)
