The menu is expanded, and all delicious.  I had the crab cakes, roquefort salad with toasted hazelnuts and roasted duck breast.  It was all divine!  Can't wait to go back to try more dishes.  The bar is also welcoming with many handcrafted cocktails by the gracious Helena.  Then there are the desserts/tartes they are famous for and Jessica the original pastry chef is there to prepare them.
This whole relocation and project has been a labor of love, but it has been worth it!  Don't miss the opportunity to check this out, before you have to wait forever to get a reservation.  It is so unique- nothing like it I have seen in Phoenix.  Ron ( the owner) will be there to welcome you and share his vision come to life so you can experience it as well.  It will become a Favorite- I am positive!
