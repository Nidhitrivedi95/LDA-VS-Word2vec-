OkC86YtZ0Nm19my5F4GGrQ 4.5 stars. My friend and I loved nearly everything about Tartine. [Hard to imagine what set Daniel B off.]  We were there Saturday for lunch and enjoyed a cheese platter, a lovely white Burgundy (reasonably priced), a frisee salad (delicious), and a (delectable) heirloom tomato pizza with pesto drizzled on top. We would highly recommend the pizza: very thin crust  and fresh slices of red and green tomatoes - great in its simplicity.  Finally, about the decor: there is a charming outdoor seating area - and the inside has a nice bistro feel. This is a restaurant that is comfortable with itself. [I go to Paris often (Daniel B take note) and appreciated the ambiance here for its unpretentiousness.]
