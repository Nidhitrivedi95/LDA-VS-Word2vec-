OkC86YtZ0Nm19my5F4GGrQ I really love going to this place.First off, it meets my top three criteria for a pleasurable dining experience: clean, good service and good food. The inside is small with a bar running down one side and tables down the other. They also have a nice patio area.  Right now Rocky River has the whole street torn up which detracts from the ambiance but i'd say their outside seating area is very pleasant regardless of the construction around it.

Their menu is limited but everything I've had has been good. The onion soup and stuffed dates are both very decadent. If you like duck and figs, the duck tartine is a very tasty. Also they have this one cocktail called the Lemon Ginger Sour that I dream about. This place has an upscale bistro vibe but is still very comfortable; the waitstaff is friendly and attentive but has never been pushy or tried to rush us.

I've never had to wait for a table but I'm not sure if I ever went on a weekend so you might want to make a reservation, especially if your party is larger than 2.
