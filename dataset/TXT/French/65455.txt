U1LB3sRMGTu_h7Sf9QdNoA Oops, another one I forgot to review.

This tiny, cozy cafe is a wonderful stop for brunch (available on weekends only). We received very good service, despite it being crowded and busy. There was a group of ~7 happily waiting in the hallway for a seat. I'd suggest if you're more than 3 people to try and make a reservation, though I don't know their policy regarding this.

Seating is very cramped, we practically shared a table with another couple.

We both ordered an eggs Benedict. He ordered the Florentine and I ordered the Norwegian, both on brioche. I would definitely reccommend the brioche over the regular English Muffin (lol, it's a French cafe!). I also ordered a latte, which was spectacular. We rounded the meal out with a dessert - the Chouquette. I was pleasantly surprised that the baked goods were being churned out of the kitchen constantly! I also remember getting a little something sweet with our bill, but I can't remember what...perhaps a cream puff?

I would highly recommend this place for brunch but be prepared to rub elbows and wait :)
