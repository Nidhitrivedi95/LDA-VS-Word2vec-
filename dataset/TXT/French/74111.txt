xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g My wife and I had dinner there to celebrate our 29th wedding anniversary. This has to be the best restaurant in Vegas. From the ladies escort at the elevator, the host, the bartender, and of coarse our fabulous waiter Stephon wait on you hand and foot. The restaurants decor and view of the strip is something to always remember. The drinks were great, the food delicious and the desserts were out of this world. "A MUST GO IF IN VEGAS AND I WILL RETURN".
