el-3IdlW3bTCSnquLvH-3w Our first night in Scottsdale, we searched Yelp for a place to have dinner, and luckily found this wonderful place that was so great we went back the next day for brunch.  The owners are gracious and welcoming, the house wine delicious, and we loved every dish we ordered.  We are looking forward to going back for lunch today!
