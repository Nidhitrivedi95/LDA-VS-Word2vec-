SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA Great dining experience! As soon as I tasted the savory French toast appetizer (with balsamic drizzle and mushrooms) I knew I was in for a treat.

My dining partners absolutely raved about the french onion soup which made its mark by adding hearty beef to the mix of onion and cheese goodness.

I got the cod on the waiters recommendation and because I was intrigued by its Alsace/German preparation with spätzle. It was so good that I returned the following week for seconds. Those I was with got the trout and thoroughly enjoyed it. I feel confident saying generally that they do their fish really well. 

There is just so much yum packed into this bustling but cozy and dimly lit French restaurant. They also have a lot for parking FYI.
