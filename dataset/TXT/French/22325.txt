BSmqxPbQglQwP2R56OqOag I'm from the Bay Area where restaurants are plentiful.  Surprisingly they made the best squid ink pasta I've ever had.  My brother loved their Steak & Frites which was cooked just right.

To top it off, they gave me my favorite dessert (Panna Cotta) complimentary since it was our 1st time.  Hands down the best restaurant in this plaza and we tried a few.
