rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I've had Bouchon under my bookmarked list for some time now and finally tried it out on my last day in Vegas before heading home. The wait was surprisingly short and I the service was amazing. 

// FOOD //
Croque Madame: Toasted ham & cheese on brioche with a fried egg and sauce Mornay served with French fries. I thought this dish was a little heavy, but it was a perfect dish to share. The flavors were on point and with a little Tabasco sauce it made it even better. I just loved how you break the yolk on the egg and it runs down the whole brioche. I would recommend this dish for sure. 

Poulet et des Gaufres: Basically this is a chicken and waffles dish. It comes with a roasted chicken, a bacon-chive waffle, Tahitian vanilla bean butter & sauce Chasseur which is like a thick gravy with pieces of mushroom and other vegetables. The vanilla bean butter was on point with the waffle! The roasted chicken was tender and still juicy. 

Overall, I really enjoyed the food and service here at Bouchon Bistro. It lived up to my expectations and I would highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the Vegas area. I'm looking forward to coming back again to try several other menu items that caught my eye!
