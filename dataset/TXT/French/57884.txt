rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A For a fine dining comfortable experience, without feeling stuffy, this is definitely the spot.

Hit up brunch for a fine dining interpretation of chicken n waffles.  Juicy, roasted chicken served alongside bacon and chives waffles with this vanilla sauce.  You can't compare it to some Rosco's Chicken n Waffles, but it's damm good.  

Steak and frites are yummy and finish it off with the Lemon Tart or the dark chocolate mousse.   

Will be back!
