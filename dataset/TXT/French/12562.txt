4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Love this place for its excellent food, top notch service and prime location on the Strip. I have been here several times for breakfast, brunch and lunch and always enjoyed my meal. People watching is a distraction if you eat outside but well worth it. No, it is not Paris but it is in the shadow of the Eiffel Tower.

I am looking forward to my next visit.
