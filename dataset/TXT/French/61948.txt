STX8NfaW_xP6YZq-wERHYg Very good crepes, slow service, pleasant lunch.

We tried two crepes. The smoked salmon was delicious and had a nice serving of salmon in a dill/yogurt sauce that was filling and delicious. The mushroom and béchamel crepe could have used a little more gruyere or perhaps another component. It tasted great but wasn't enough to act as a meal. Both were served on a (unique to Madison eating) buckwheat-flour crepe that was terrific. The crepe was hearty, substantive, and tasty, and I'd return again just because of the crepe itself.

Side salads impressed mainly because of the dressing: a high-caliber olive oil that left nice peppery aftertaste on the tongue (only the high octane ones are that complex) mixed with aioli. I had never considered such a combination but it was brilliant and every leaf and tomato shined because of it.

With iced tea our bill came out to just over $30 for two, which is pretty pricey. If you're looking to be full for affordable prices Plaka is a better choice down the street, but for a light lunch in a quaint cafe this is your place. It took over an hour to eat lunch, btw, so note that this is more of a place to linger than grab a quick bite.
