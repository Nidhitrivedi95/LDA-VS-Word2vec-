4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I have been going to Mon Ami Gabi at the Paris Hotel for years.  They have amazing dishes on their dinner menu (the steak roquefort and the baked cheese appetizer are my faves) and the ambiance can't be beat!  But, I have recently discovered their breakfast menu.  OMG!

I have been to breakfast at Mon Ami Gabi twice now, and I definitely plan to go back.  Keep in mind that they stop serving at 11am, so make sure to get there by 10:30.  I also recommend a reservation, and make sure to sit at least in the indoor/outdoor patio section, if you can't sit outdoors.  Sitting inside during the day just isn't worth it.

I have eaten the eggs benedict twice now (so good!)  My husband has had the croissant sandwich twice now and he likes that a lot too. People I went with tried an omelet with crème fraiche (made to order) and the ham and cheese crepe (with brie, instead of swiss).  They loved it all!  Their sweet breakfast items also look amazing.  Definitely a great stop when you are in Vegas!
