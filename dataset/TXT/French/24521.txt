cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg I wished I had like a dozen stomachs to try their whole menu!!!!  What we did get to order was nice but frankly not as "awe-inspiring" as I had expected after reading all the great reviews of this restaurant.  (So I am spoilt!) Nonetheless, the food was good and well worth a try.

Foie Gras Cromesquis - basically a foie gras liquid croquette which was a tad too sweet for my liking!  Give me a nicely seared piece of foie gras any day. 

Stuffed Pied de Cochon with Foie Gras - you really have to attack this as soon as it reaches the table - hot foie gras with hot pork is great.  Not so great when the pork cools down and you get that wiff of gamey pork smell.  It was hard to take after that. The portion is really huge and you might do well sharing this instead.

Duck Magret in Mushroom Sauce  -  I have never seen so much mushroom served with duck magret before!  It was not a "SAUCE" as much as a generous serving of sliced mushroom piled on top of the beautifully seared duck.  Nice touch. The duck was tender and cooked to perfection.

Order your desserts early cos they might just run out of what you want.  The pecan pie was delicious - lots of nuts and smooth syrup base without the gritty sugar bits you get from some pies.

The service can get kinda slow but the food makes up for it.  Try it if you are in Montreal and remember to make your booking early.  They were recently reviewed in the NYT and are getting alot of attention from visitors to the city.
