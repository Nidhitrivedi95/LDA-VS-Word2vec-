htQgj-ANQpZGpIpkkrEmyQ Would rate this place a 3.5 if possible. I was really excited to go here, so we made a reservation the day before for Saturday. We got there at around 11:45 am and most of the tables were already taken. The restaurant is trendy and clean inside. We ordered the pulled pork frites to start, Korean steak bennies and chicken and waffles. 

The fries were delicious! However, the mains were both just okay and we both felt sick after. Service was decent. We were checked up on a lot and our waters were refilled quickly. The only thing was our wait for our food was long and the food did not live up to the hype. 

Overall, for our meal, including tip, it was around $50 and we both left.. Uninspired.
