O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q A group of six's reservation was made a couple of hours in advance and we were seated on time.  Walking to our table, I noticed the cheese bar where they had some real exotic cheeses.  The ambiance is good, with the lighting slightly on the darker side.

It looked like most everyone was having steak for dinner and the price ranged from about $30 for an 8 oz to $160 for a 8oz Kobe filet.  I went against the grain and order the arugula salad and beef shortribs.

The salad was superb.  The vinaigrette was perfectly balanced.  I'd highly recommend it.  It is garnished with small strips of bacon that were real tasty.

The shortribs were good and season well, though a bit on the dry side.  It is served on top of some mashed potatoes.  It was good, but nothing truly memorable.

The side dishes we ordered were good but the portions were a bit small.  The people in our group all had steaks and said they enjoyed it, but no one said it was a memorable experience.

Summary:  good, safe choice but clearly not as good as Bouchon, CUT, or B&B at the Venetian.
