rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A It was really a 3.5 star experience for me. I am giving it 4 stars because I do want to come back and try other stuff off the menu. 

I got the bone marrow, salade de betteraves and lamb. It was my first time trying bone marrow for me and I really liked it. But my fave of the night was the salad. As for the lamb, it was good too but nothing exceptional. 

For me, I think I had too great of an expectation going in. I have been to plenty of restaurants in Vancouver and they are just as good. 
As for the service, we didn't feel neglected but it wasn't spot on.

But I would definitely would like to give it another chance next time I am in town.
