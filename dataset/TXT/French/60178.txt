I really like this place. I actually went here for my classy bachelorette party a couple years back. :) When they open up the outdoor seating onto the lake it is like paradise.

Last evening we dined at Sardine and shared piccolo fritto which was a wonderful combo of asparagus, eggplant, cauliflower, and zucchini. We also sampled the lobster croquettes which were phenomenal.

After that, we were quite full so we shared the house salad and shared a penne with smoked salmon dish. The salmon was really great and the textures and flavors in the pasta dish worked very well together.

For dessert we shared an amazing hazelnut chocolate ganache with crunchy crust and caramel.

I'll be back.
