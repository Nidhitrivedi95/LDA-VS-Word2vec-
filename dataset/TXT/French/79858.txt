zra20XPGVL9P3i5hMoKjig I just stumbled across this gem while walking in Oldtown Scottsdale. Only open one week my plan is to become one of their first regulars. I had smoked salmon carpaccio w fennel salad and Arancini, both were excellent! You have to check this place out the owners are amazing and the food is awesome!
