hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA I had the Moroccan panini at the recommendation of one of the French ladies at the register im assuming  is the owner. It was very yummy and clean tasting. I really enjoyed it. The reason this place only got three stars instead of five was I felt that some of the people working there were a tad snooty. I realize this is completely subjective and may not have been reality at all but when I come in and say hello how does this work is there a menu or something the lady turns and says there is a register right there and kept walking to the kitchen with some dishes I believe it was. That was the extent of my greeting not hello not hi but there's a register right there. Ok then. I dunno maybe it's the Frenchness maybe it was something else but that was one thing that bothered me I really didn't feel welcomed I felt like I was a bit of a burden being in their restaurant. Very unfortunate for such yummy food. I will certainly try it again due to the level of the food hopefully it'll be a better experience next time.
