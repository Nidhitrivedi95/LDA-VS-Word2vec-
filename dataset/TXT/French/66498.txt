uP3H5bcsiTXM0k0xQhRndg My fiance and I ate here on our trip to Montreal last week and had a reallly great meal. It's a small place, so it's easy to miss, but I am so glad that we didn't! The restaurant is a family owned place and the hostess/owner took such pride in telling us about how they all work together to craft the menu and bring it to life. The food was delicious. We had the beet salad with their homemade cheese, candied walnuts and sprouts. For our dinner, I had the Black Truffle Rigatoni with fresh cream and house made bacon and my fiance had their mac and cheese with ham. Both were so, so delicious. We left too full for dessert and I wish we would have been able to go there again before we left Montreal. Highly recommend.
