One of my favorite entrees is the chicken and mushroom crepe. It's just delicious and creamy and full of flavor. I had a delicious cappuccino and eggs Benedict for brunch which was also delicious. The restaurant is a little unassuming from the outside, but the inside it adorable, with great big pictures of Europe and a cafe feel. Definitely would recommend to anyone!
