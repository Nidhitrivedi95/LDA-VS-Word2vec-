Service, including attentiveness, was five star. However, the young sous chefs may not realize that the chatter and glances, especially at gals walking by the restaurant, are obvious and distract from the exemplary experience at Crush.

Other than the detractors, the salad, wines, and waiter and attendant, made the Crush an enjoyable lunch reprieve. (Bread was worth a return trip.)
