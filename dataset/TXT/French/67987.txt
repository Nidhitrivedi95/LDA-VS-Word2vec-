V9ALGxjWDwxD93Sklth1YA First off let me say this, if you want authentic French cousine... go elsewhere this isn't anything close to resembling real french cuisine.

That being said, we went here for a birthday dinner.  The atmosphere was charming and quaint.  The waitstaff was kind and willing to explain if there were any questions.  The food... was... boring.  Completely boring.  There was nothing resembling what i have expected.  Being that I've eaten real french cousine cooked by a frence chef, this was a let down.  At almost 300 for all of us... I would never, ever go there again.  Even the desert was lacking.  The wine was bland.  The entree was overcooked and underwhelming.

They should consider hiring a chef who is familiar with authentic french cousine, or change the name of the joint.
