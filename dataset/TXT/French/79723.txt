zqNgwQjj0_XAll-neGikIw Great hidden gem in Oldtown! I ordered the breakfast sandwich and coffee. It's made with bacon and eggs wrapped in a croissant, a side of hash browns, and a mixed green salad. It was a good portion, probably a little larger than I would normally finish, but I was hungry today. The prices are very reasonable for the portion and quality. The croissant was flaky, buttery, and delicious, and the bacon was thick cut and crispy, perfect for me. I was a little disappointed they didn't have espresso drinks yet, but the regular coffee was very good as well. They should be serving espresso drinks soon. My boyfriend ordered the eggs benedict which looked delicious, but sadly he ate it all before I could snag a bite. He said it was very good. The eggs were poached perfectly. He would have preferred bacon, which he's had before, but I generally prefer the traditional ham with my benedict. 

The staff is helpful and very friendly. As a nice touch, the owner/ chef came over to make sure everything was to our liking. The atmosphere is good. It seems like it's still a little work in progress, but I'd say shabby chic. It's the same owners and location formerly known as Scratch with a similar menu. Scratch was one of my favorite breakfast places, so I was very excited to see they opened a new restaurant. I was not disappointed. I'm sure Merci will remain one of my favorites. I'm excited to try the lunch and dinner menu.
