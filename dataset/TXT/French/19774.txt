aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw MACAROOOOOOOOOOOOOOONS. I took some home with me, they've been sitting on the table for a week, and I've been slowly eating my heart out. I feel so dirty for liking this kind of deliciousness...

Was a little disappointed by the chocolate croissant. I've tasted better but as soon as I microwaved it, I understood the foodgasm everyone's been raving about in these reviews.

YUM! Bouchon, je t'adore et je vous retournez! (I don't know if that's right, my 4 high school years of french have not had much of a chance to be practiced)
