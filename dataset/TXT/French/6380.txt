4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Probably my favorite place for brunch..then again I'm bias cause I love French cuisine. Overall satisfied with the food and service and price is reasonable. I always get a croquet or steak and frites but this time we had the mussels and lobster roll and was super fulfilling. My friends got the corned beef hash,steak and waffles and they were pleased with what they ordered so yay!! Glad my Bay Area friends love this place as much as I do. If you come check this place out and don't mind waiting for the patio seating it's definitely worth it. Oh yeah I like that fact that you can dress up casually here for brunch :)
