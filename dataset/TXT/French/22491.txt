They are a 90% from scratch kitchen and you could really taste that "just made" quality in the food.  We ordered a side of the saffron risotto as an appetizer and it was perfectly cooked - creamy and delicious.  I ordered the chicken parmesean with the chicken grilled as opposed to fried.  It arrived perfectly cooked, moist and delicious with a wonderful maranara sauce on the side and an arugula salad.  Yum!  My husband ordered the pork chop which again was wonderfully prepared with the exception of the sauce which was too sweet for me and had a slight burnt taste.  Great experience overall for food and service. We'll go back for sure
