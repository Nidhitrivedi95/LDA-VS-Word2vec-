SFnrHuVFSNiondFVUBLJZQ I was a bit dissapointed with my first real crepe experience. The place has plenty of room with three floors but is still a very cramped environment .We walked in and sat and the waiters walked past us for about ten minutes before someone came over. For drinks, we got a bloody caesar and the cocoloco smoothie. They mistakenly made a bloody mary and informed us, which I was fine with. The drink though, was virtually all tomato juice and I couldn't taste any tabasco/pepper or vodka, and there was no celery or garnish. Probably the worst bloody mary I have ever had. The cocoloco was pretty good, but very artificial tasting. I got the crepe charlevoix, which was generous portion. Even though I was hungry, it wasn't that good. I do wish they had more meat options with their crepes. The dessert crepes looked very good but I wasn't in the mood for one. I tried the quiche which was decent. Overall, not worth the $50+ bill for a crepe, quiche, and two drinks.
