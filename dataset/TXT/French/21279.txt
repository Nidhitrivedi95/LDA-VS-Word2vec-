B56AYe5GNuavMDtwFsXqzA I have never had such a perfectly cooked steak in my entire life! This is my new favorite place in the valley!!

We started w/ the sangria-style cocktail - a yummy blend of red wine, brandy and triple sec w/ an orange rind garnish. They were potent and delish! 

For starters, fois gras and mussels. The Fois Gras melted in your mouth like butter and was served w/ grilled peaches and a small piece of grilled bread - it was SO SO GOOD. One of the most wonderful things I have ever  put in my mouth! The mussels were amazing as well, served in a simple thick pernod lemon butter with leeks. They brought us bread so we could enjoy every bit of the broth.

For entrees, we had steak frite and duck confit. The duck was cooked to perfection, falling off the bone with crispy skin and a perfect amount of sauce and vegie medley The steak frite was to-die-for - medium rare was perfectly red - every bite melted in my mouth - it was truly heavenly.

For desert, we had the chocolate creme brulee - it was perfectly caramelized over the entire surface! As a creme brulee connoisseur, I can tell you that nothing is more disappointing than a half-assed caramelized top - this one set a new standard for how creme brulee should be done!

You definitely want to make a reservation for this place - it's a tiny little cozy room with a bar and lots of tiny tables. It was cramped, but I never felt like I didn't have enough space. This is not a superficial spot - people were dressed casually and everyone in the place was having a great time. This is not a place to eat with children, but fantastic for a date night. 

HIGHLY recommend this place!!! Great food, great service, great atmosphere!!!! TEN STARS!!
