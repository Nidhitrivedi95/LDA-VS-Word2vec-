xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g The views were amazing.  We saw several Bellagio fountain shows.   Don't feel too weird taking pictures, everyone does.  

The food wasn't amazing but it was good.  We both had the skirt steak which was extremely well flavored and tender.  There were several extras, which was nice.  We went for our anniversary and the restaurant brought us a nice little dessert on the house.

The staff were all very nice and thorough but I did constantly feel like they were trying to sell me something from the cook book to the constant comments of this nature: "Did you want to add a side of potatoes to that?" (When the dish came with a variation of potatoes).

On a final note, if you're trying to decide between the Top of the World and the Eiffel Tower Restaurant stick with the EFT.  Paris is much more centrally located and the buildings you have views of aren't tiny specs in the abyss.  And Paris is just plain classier.  Having to trek to the Stratosphere takes the class out of the experience.  And when you're in $50+ pp you want a little class.
