It is so modern and chic. All the rooms are amazing, they are beautifully furnished and so very, very cool. The food is delicious too, the breakfast in particular is to die for. I asked the waiter how they made their scrambled eggs, because they were unlike any i've ever had before! I wish I hadn't asked - his answer of 'double cream' and 'full fat butter' actually made my bum cheeks sag.
whenever I have friends coming to the city, I recommend they stay here. Party because it's amazing, but mainly because it means I can come and have breakfast with them.

It is a bit out of the way, but the area is lovely and there are great transport links. Plus it's beside some really lovely restaurants, so who needs to be in the city centre!
