4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Had a nice dinner this past weekend at Mon Ami Gabi.  We were seated on the veranda and able to view the fountains at the Bellagio.

My wife had the mussels marinere and said they were good, but not the best.  Generous helping and much larger than her favorite P.E.I. mussels but edible.  I had the Dijon mustard steak.  It was good, but a very thin slice and rather salty.  We both had the frites (fries) and they were very tasty.  By far the best was the warm baggette and butter served at the table.

The waiter was very friendly and service was prompt and not rushed.

All in All, a nice place to have dinner in Vegas!
