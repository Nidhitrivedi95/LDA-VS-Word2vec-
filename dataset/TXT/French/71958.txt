XI3iNUgChOfJk5ppjKVEQQ The place is FABULOUS! It is small, maybe 12-14 tables total so it would probably be best to have a reservation. On nice evenings the front window opens up for a nice view onto the street. Great service. Our server was extremely attentive.

I had 2 drinks. The peach bellini which was so much better than your average bellini. I really wanted to order another, but I also wanted to try another drink from the menu - which by the way is very cute and built into the front of an old book. The other drink was the blueberry beret, a gin based cocktail. Also really good and I'm not a huge gin fan.

Dinner was impeccable. We had a couple of oysters and the local noyan cheeses to start. For dinner I choose the beef shortribs and I suggest you do the same. Best shortribs I have ever had! Skipped dessert but there were a couple of things that caught my eye, one being a goat cheese cheesecake.

This is a must when visiting Old Montreal!
