YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g I had the tasting menu with wine pairing and everything was good.  Nothing, however, stood out as exceptional.  Maybe it's because the restaurant is located in a massive hotel on the strip that Hubert feels he can't go for it.  I know he has better dishes inside him and I would like to experience them.  Another negative is the price.  On top of an expensive tasting menu, plus wine pairing, we had to pay for special seating.  Only in Vegas......We did get autographed burger books as consolation.
