(looked like a good bar too, but alas I'm working)

I had the BBQ meat loaf and the Mac and cheese, both above par.

I'll be back next time I am in town.


Hint - the bar downstairs (where you enter) is not the only dining area, theres a slightly more classy main dining room on the second floor as well. 
(my review is from the bar however)
