z6ZPIpO_1Rx69k9y2DQ7Bw This is my second time here. The first time it was crowded. I ordered breakfast and my food came out cold. This time no wait, ordered breakfast and the food was Luke warm and not worth $40 for 2 people. They also forgot to give me a potato galette, even after I reminded them. When we went through the line to get our utensils, they were out of forks and had plastic forks in place of the real ones. I had to stop the manager and ask for a fork. You guys can do better than this. You need someone that knows how to place people and keep the food line moving so orders are promptly picked up and customers receive "hot" food. This is my last time coming here. I will gladly drive 35 minutes to Cafe Monte in South Park! You get great customer service and the food is amazing. I came to you because I wanted to patronize our local businesses. I am completely disappointed.
