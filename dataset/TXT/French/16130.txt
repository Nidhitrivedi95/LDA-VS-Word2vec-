78TC3sZSYBzBsSJ0z5pyhw Stopped at Le Provencal because there wasn't a line.  Service was somewhat fast, but really nothing special.  What was confusing was that a restaurant with a French name, in a French themed casino was so Italian.  There was a guy singing "Mamma Mia" to tables when we were seated... 

I had the rigatoni, and my girlfriend had the ravioli, which may be one of the ugliest dishes I've ever seen.  My meal was not good either.  We each had one drink and the bill was over $80 which seems absolutely ridiculous considering how bad the food was.  We regretted not getting fast food at this point, because it would have tasted better. 

All in all, it may be a two star experience, but the food left my girlfriend very sick that night and most of the next day.  After reading some more reviews, it looks like she wasn't the only one...

We will certainly never return.
