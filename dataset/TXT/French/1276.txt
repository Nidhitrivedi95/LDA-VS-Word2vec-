_T7f2wUgNlJqxsR-cR89SQ I've only been to one restaurant on the planet better than this and it was in Paris. Simply as good as it gets, and the view of the city at night was spectacular. Nobody should be allowed to open a fine dining restaurant without first coming here to see how perfection is done lol.
