WUq7NNgCTaPphTYL6qyEBQ An update to my recent review of Mogette.  I have been there again twice in the past month with friends & family for dinner.  The food was excellent both nights.  Both nights I again ordered the Saddle of Lamb which I complained in my original review had come overcooked.  Both times it was cooked to perfection.  And it was a very generous portion.  Other mains ranged from Boeuf Bourgignon to Beef Tenderloin to Mussels with Blue Cheese to Steak Tartare.  All were very good.  Bottom line - Mogette's food is very good and the pricing is reasonable.  However, service is a real weak spot at Mogette.  The servers were different on each of my 3 visits and each time they were very inexperienced.  They were earnest and tried hard.  But what they clearly needed was a senior server or floor manager to co-ordinate their activities.  That's a role to owner could have played - since he was on-site for each of our dinners.  He could have helped with clearing tables, opening wine, filling water glasses and guiding rookies who were struggling to cope.  But he didn't.  It's a shame.  Because even people like me, who like Mogette's food, won't put up with the poor service for long.  Here's hoping they can elevate the service to the level of the kitchen.  Soon!
