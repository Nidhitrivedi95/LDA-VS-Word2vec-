3uC7Lbc3RgUDTWQlBu4PqQ Oh my gosh! What a special restaurant! One must take an elevator to the tower floor to arrive at this special spot. Love the ambiance of the dark wood, panel windows with a view to an outside dining area. Too bad we were there for only bakery pastries (amazingly delish), because I'm sure a meal there would be equally awesome! The wait staff are impeccably dressed and very professional. This is one special place!!!
