Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA Great view of Vegas at night if you're sitting near the window or outdoor seating.  Food was just ok.  I had the lobster and chicken, lobster was way over salted and gf's fish was over salted too.  I had the tuna tartar for starter was very good, gf had the onion soup, which she liked also.  
If you make reservations there, call them to see if you can get outdoor seating, there's heat lamps so you won't freeze outside at night.  The view is one of the best out there.
