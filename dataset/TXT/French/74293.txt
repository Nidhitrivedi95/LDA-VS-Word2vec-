xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g We have been going to this restaurant every time we visit Vegas and this was by far the best experience yet!  We were getting married on Sat and had dinner reservations for Thurs night, had the best seat in the house.  The corner table with a full view of the fountains.

We live in the Napa Valley, so we know all about good food.  The fois gras and scallops were devine!  He had salmon and I had the sea bass, which were outstanding!!  Everyone should visit, I cannot wait to come back... hopefully sooner then later!
