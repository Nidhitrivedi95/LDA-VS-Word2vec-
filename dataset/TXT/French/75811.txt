YK313oIaYb8Z2NQHL1NWBQ If you're looking for the quintessential fancy-pants nouveau-Parisian fare, this is it. 

Although the bread was not fresh-baked there was a home-made cheese-flatbread that was good. The French onion soup defines the dish and the rest of the food I had was pretty tasty, too. Part of the menu is reasonable prix-fixed fare, too, which is kind of nice when you have an expense report to fill out.

Not only do they focus on French "traditional" cuisine, but they mix native-American foods and twists in as well. Caribou jerky, wild rabbit and deer, and salmon round out a very large menu. I had the chocolate-mousse cake for dessert and it was scrumptious.

Given that I have kids and that the wife and them may show up here in Montreal with me one of these days I took notice of the highchairs and kids menu. It is certainly pricey for kids, with $13 kids meals. In fact, there is venison on the kids menu here(!) I think mine will stick with the chicken fingers. Given that the place can get noisy; it has a high roof for aggregating sound, it may be a good choice for kids.
