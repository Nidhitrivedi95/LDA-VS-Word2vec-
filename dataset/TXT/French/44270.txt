ME6D5nLlfG0xZCtICOYDuw I've been to Georges a bunch and my favorite time to go is for brunch! I've had dinner here several times and it's usually hit or miss. Brunch is always a hit from the food, service and bottomless mimosas. For dinner, I've had their smoked pork chop, beef bougbugion (restaurant week 2014), clay pot lobster pappardelle, salmon with a pea sauce of some sort and vegetarian pasta (both during restaurant week 2017). The first salmon that came out was undercooked and the 2nd was perfect but it was time to go (ate at home later on). I would omit that pea puree next time, texture & taste was a no go. I will definitely be doing brunch again but I'm not so sure about dinner. Brunch alone is 5 stars!! Service is usually very good too.
