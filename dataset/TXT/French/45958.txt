mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q We dined here and it was a disappointment.  The food is always on point but on this occasion the service by the front server was unwelcoming.  For the money you are paying, the servers should be at the very least warm and hospitable.  Not this time.  

The front server always sets the tone of the experience.  Patrick acted like he did not want to be there and was merely going through the motions of service.  Very unfriendly.  He stated, would you like me to go over the menu with you?  Duh?! Why are we here?!  The back server is a long time employee and for him and the food is the reason I'm giving the place 2 stars.  

Even the manager had a pompous attitude. Never checked on us to see how everything was going.  Just walked around doing nothing.  Sad.  It was a slow evening and you would have expected better.  $367 later for the two of us and we will probably not return.  Check your attitudes.
