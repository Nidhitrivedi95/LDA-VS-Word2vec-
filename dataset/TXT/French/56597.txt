rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A ah, Bouchon.  So many people talk about this place but I had never been.  First, it's in a ridiculous location as others have noted.  Everyone else's reviews are very poor in their direction.  I think someone said that it's in the southwest area of the Venetian.  Ok. Who the F**k  has a compass in the F**king casino???    It's by the registration lobby.  That simple.  Take the elevators up and you are there.

There was a small wait for the brunch.  The brunch menu is basically the same as the breakfast (with a few additions).  So. . . .

Chicken and Waffles.  - Glorious.  The waffles have bits of bacon in them and they are amazing.  The Chicken is roasted and not fried.  I have to think that it is better this way because I can't imagine this dish being beat by any restaurant.  You must get this.

French Toast - Looks great but it's not that impressive.  You should try something else.  

Ambiance - I think the restaurant loses a star here.  The decor is dated and the tables too crowded.  There were a couple of single old men sitting by themselves on the small tables and whenever they coughed, I cringed.  Who knows what germs they caught from their respective escorts last night?  

I still highly recommend, even just for the chicken and waffles.
