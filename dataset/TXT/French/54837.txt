rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw Boy, restaurants in Las Vegas have sure come a long way  :). The BARDOT is located in the Aria hotel. This is very much a high end restaurant. The service is impeccable and the ambience is tasteful. 

I went here for dinner with a colleague and we both enjoyed this restaurant very much. For drinks, I started with the Moscow Mule. It wasn't on the cocktail menu but the server assured me that they made it very well, and he was right. It was excellent. We then had a cab. for dinner, which was very good as well. 

For appetizers, I was planning on getting the foie gras parfait based on the reviews, but the server explained that this was more of a mousse, and if I was looking for a real piece of foie gras, to get the seared foie gras lyonnaise. OMG, it was amazing. The lentils and the caramelized shallots were a perfect complement. We also got the tuna tartare, it was okay. 

For dinner, I ordered the rack of lamb, medium rare. These were served over creamy polenta. It was amazing. The lamb chops were thick and juicy and cooked perfectly. Some of the best lamb chops I've had. Unfortunately, there really was no room for dessert. 

This place is pricy, but the product that the provide is well worth it. An outstanding experience. I highly recommend it.
