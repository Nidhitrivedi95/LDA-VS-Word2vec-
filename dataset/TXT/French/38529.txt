jLxeBgWhLRbII2ACkgH1Sg Me and my husband used to go to La Berre Terre on any possible occasion. The service was great and the food was delicious! Now everything is so different and disappointing. 
The employees at the cashier are ALWAYS RUDE and so unwelcoming. Not to say they always messed up my order and double ask what did I order!!! You don't have to ask me- you should have a copy of my receipt! I asked which tea is caffein free and I received an answer "I don't know, the teas are there, just choose one"! 
The pasties used to look like real French artisan ones and now they are small, old and crappy looking. We even compared it to Jean Phillippe's pastries back in the days. I understand you guys have a new location and probably focus mainly on it but why do you have to neglect your first location so bad. Needless to say I'm never coming back. They are other places who values me as a customer
