4cWrtMvfj-tomyEPgP7KFg Excellent service and great food. I went during restaurant week for the first time and despite the staff being extremely busy, our waiter was very helpful and friendly. Pleasantly surprised with the amount of food that was provided, wonderful service, and great cocktails. I can't wait to go back but will definitely only eat a small meal before I go.

My group started with the cheddar fondue and upgraded our meal with the artisan meats. Excellent choice as the meat and cheese combination was perfect. 

For our individual entrees, we chose the Coq Au Vin and I would highly recommend this cooking style as it goes well with any meat, poultry, or seafood. The herb crusted pork was especially delicious. Although there are so many other cooking styles to chose from, I don't think I could stray from my original choice as it was too delicious.
