Tefx_N6A6nrsdj4jHHnbYg Their Almond Croissant is the best I've had so far in Las Vegas. The texture and taste(not too sweet) is perfect. I had the Turkey, Apple, & Brie Sandwich that was really good. Looks like they have a good selection of teas, which I want to try next time. The owner(I think she is), is super sweet and helpful!
