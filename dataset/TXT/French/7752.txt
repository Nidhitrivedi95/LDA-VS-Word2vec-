4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw The view here is fabulous as many have already mentioned.  We made reservations for the main dining room and was lucky to be seated in the patio.  There was a tree that obstructed our view but nonetheless it was nice to sit outside.  Seating was intimate yet spaced far enough from other diners.  

We had the escargot and crab cakes to start.  Both were good.  I had the bone-in ribeye, which was good as well.  My only complaint about the dish was that it was actually quite salty and paired with frites didn't help the saltiness.  The dishes were pricer, but this is due to the location.  

Service was attentive, we never waited too long for our waiter and water was refilled within a reasonable amount of time.  It was a nice experience, however nothing special to me.
