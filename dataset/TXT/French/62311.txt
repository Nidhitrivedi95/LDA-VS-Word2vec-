SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ Not one of the better choices at this price point. I had been wanting to try this place for a while due to the hype, but was a little disappointed. Nothing was bad, but nothing stood out either and if I'm paying $25 - $30 for an entree I expect the food to be pretty spectacular. I came here with a group of friends before a show at Gammage. My husband and I shared the soup special which was a white bean pork soup, the PEI mussels and the osso buco. To drink, my husband had the Franziskaner and I had the Green Thing and a margarita. The soup and mussels came out first. The mussels were good, but I've also cooked mussels as good as these. The soup was lukewarm, we should have sent it back but were with a group and didn't want to be bothersome and it was not as robust or flavorful as expected. They split the osso buco for us which was nice, but it wasn't one of the better osso bucos that I've had. The pork was cooked perfectly, but I felt that the sauce on it was too sweet and a little overpowering. It came with toasted white beans and sugar snap peas which I found to be a strange combo, a potato or other starch would have been better. The dish included gruyere, but the amount was so little that it didn't really add to the dish. My husband chose the flourless brownie for dessert and it was a bit on the dry side. I took one bite and it was good but not great, and not enough for me to want to waste the calories on. My favorite thing that I had was the Green Thing cocktail which had fresh cucumber and gin, it was delicious and very refreshing. The service was great and the ambiance was very nice, but I just didn't think the food was a great value for the price. I've had much better meals at this price point, so I could only see myself coming back here to enjoy the cocktails.
