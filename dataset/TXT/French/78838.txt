ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug I had a great experience here, came in from a long drive from oc, checked in and grabbed a late lunch. The wait was a bit long and looked around seeing empty tables but maybe the servers were busy or the hostess got tied up in something. It took a while to get our orders in and I tried to hold in and keep my patience. The ceasar salad and calamari was pretty good. It's  overpriced but you pay for the experience, use your TR card to get a little slight discount and earn those RC.
