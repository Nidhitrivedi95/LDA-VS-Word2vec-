aaWhSHpsE285eaSTzDxAMA Bistro 185 offers better than average entrees and a selection that is always new. 

First off the place can be a little crowded on the weekends. Which means noise and not a lot of room to move around. But you are here for the food so on to it.  

They offer a selection of seafood fare that seems inventive and rare especially in that area. Recently they began advertising " a new dish every night." and they are seemingly delivering on that promise. That night there were offering a lobster and cream ravioli that looked delicious and also a crab bisque. The menu changes so ymmv. 

I, having just had seafood for lunch, went with their cowboy rib eye steak. It was served with red skinned potatoes, and their fried vegetables. 

For some reason they serve vegetables lightly breaded and deep fried. Not my thing at all. I actually like vegetables and I don't need them deep fried. My GF loved it though. The steak prepared to my specs, medium well and the portion was ok. potatoes were also plentiful. 

The price was not there for me. It ended up being $35 for the steak and the side salad was extra. 

Over all the food was delicious the prices and the crowd was not. The food is really well done here though so if that's not an issue, I'd recommend this place. I'm going to try it again on maybe an "off" night and I'll make sure I plan on spending $70 for dinner for 2.
