w2tr0PA0b3tg8pId0kjM-A Just picked up a box of 15 macarons, my favorite: Pistachio! The outer shell was delicate but didn't crumble in my hand. The insides were so moist and full of flavor. 

The other flavors I tried were Passionfruit-Chocolate, Gingerbread, Raspberry and Lemon. There were all delicious and magnificent to my taste buds.

If you're looking for a beautiful gift for hosts that isn't just a bottle of wine, these are perfect.
