4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw My favorite restaurant in Vegas hands down. The best French onion soup and breakfast in town, and I love the fresh baked bread. The Badoit sparkling water is so divine. I love the ambiance here. My husband always gets steak tartare, even though it's not on the menu, the chef is always happy to prepare it for you. The wait staff is also very friendly! My mother in law had the chicken with whipped cauliflower , it was delicious and my father in law had the salmon, delicious as well, both were cooked perfect! I always look forward to coming here when in town! ;)
