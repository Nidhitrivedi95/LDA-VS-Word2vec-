9ot8oInkYZTt6wkkGe__vQ Went here for a friend's wedding...and now, I regret not getting married here.  AMAZING service, delicious food, and AMAZING service.  

Champagne was served as we entered the restaurant, and I was expecting at the time.  Without saying a word, a waitress went to the back and brought me this delicious raspberry spritzer concoction knowing that I couldn't imbibe.  Then during the service, I was given a fan and a glass of ice water to drink.  I couldn't believe the kindness and thoughfulness they showed me during this wedding.  

The food!  Glorious food.  We had steak with a cold potato salad.  Steak was tender and juicy and potato salad creamy and savoury.  We all wanted seconds!  (Portion size could have been bigger I guess).  Dessert was a hazlenut chocolate ice cream dish and we couldn't say enough good things about it. 

A beautiful setting, thoughtful staff, and delicious food.  Can't wait to go back!
