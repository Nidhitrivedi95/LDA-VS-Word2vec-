kcF-en40P3J9L8nLy5lKqQ Food and service certainly good BUT the noise level is atrocious.  Sat with 2 others at a 4 top and could barely hear one another unless we yelled.  That put a damper on the evening.  Speaking of which, were the owner to put some sort of acoustic damper on the ceiling, I'd go back.  Sit outside if you actually want to speak to others at your table
