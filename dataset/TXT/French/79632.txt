zqNgwQjj0_XAll-neGikIw I guess I must've had high expectations  of fruit  tarts and lots of yummy french food. My experience was nothing remarkable  but just pretty average for the most part. I was surprised that for a patisserie  there was not a big variety of desserts or pastries. Regardlesd, the best part of this little place is the customer  service. Our waitress  was just wonderful and so attentive to everything. I ordered the quiche Lorraine  but I was not too impressed  by it and the eggs were a bit runny in it. It came with a little side of spring mix  salad and some hash browns. The side of hash brown was nice and crunchy but maybe too crunchy and greasy for my taste. Everything  was meh but their customer service makes up for it, those ladies are fantastic.
