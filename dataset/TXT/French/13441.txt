Mon Ami Gabi was the best meal of our entire Las Vegas trip last week!  We were lucky because the morning we went, the temperature was about 70 degrees and made for a perfect day to sit outside and enjoy breakfast and people watching.  
I ordered the Bananas Foster Waffle and my wife ordered the Blueberry French Toast.  Both were perfect!  Servers were friendly and attentive.  Couldn't ask for a better way to start the day.
