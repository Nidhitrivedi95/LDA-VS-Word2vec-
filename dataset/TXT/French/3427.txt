1iDBWrwjfk4w_ThhL_qTYQ Living in the neighborhood, I looked forward to the opening of this restaurant.  Our party was so excited to try this new addition to the McCormick Ranch restaurant scene. Unfortunately, it seems that Bistro du Lac is far from ready for customers.  Everything from service to food preparation is in dire need of improvement.

First, upon arrival, we were asked if we had reservations despite the fact that the restaurant was less than half capacity.  We said no and had to ask if we could sit in a near empty bar.  Along with several other patrons, we were eventually seated in the bar area and told that we could order from the full menu.  

The service was without a doubt the worst I have ever experienced in any restaurant.  Our server, while friendly, had only been on the job for two days and knew absolutely nothing about the restaurant's menu or dish preparation. Many items from the menu were apparently not available. Meals arrived at different times and were not as ordered.

I might have chalked this up to a one-off issue with our party but the table next to us experienced the exact same problems. Staff from the restaurant kept apologizing profusely because the service and kitchen performance have apparently been a problem since opening.  

Bottom line, meals at this restaurant are above average in cost related to nearby offerings.  One expects more for the prices paid at this restaurant. It is clear that this restaurant is not ready for prime time and there appears to be low awareness from managers of the problems. Open more than a month, these issues should have been addressed by now.

There are much better nearby options to consider. I would stay away until the kinks are worked out - if that's possible.
