rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I used Opentable app to make reservations for dinner. This was my first dinner at the Bouchon Las Vegas Restaurant and it was absolutely wonderful. 

The restaurant is hidden on the second floor of the Venetian. You have to walk to the check-in area, take the elevator to the second floor. Then take a left when exiting the elevator. Apparently, there is a sign, but it isn't very noticeable. 

The order was:
* Oysters on half shell $18 and Clams $1.95 each. There were multiple oyster choices to choose from, but at the end, we choose kumamotos. The oysters were small, sweet, fresh, but I really didn't like their condiment choices. It was either ketchup or balsamic vinegar. I would have preferred some mignonette dressing and/or tabasco sauce and/or raw horseradish. Clams were also sweet and fresh. No complaints there.
* Steak Frites $36.75 (4 of 5) - pan-seared prime flatiron, caramelized shallots & maître d hôtel butter, served with French fries. Traditional steak and fries done perfectly.
* Gnocchi à la Parisienne $26.75 (5 of 5) - sautéed gnocchi, with a fricassée of garden vegetables & brown butter sauce. Amazing!!! The gnocchi tasted like clouds. It was light when you bit into it but heavy tasting in the belly because of the butter sauce. The complimenting vegetables were tasty and balanced with the gnocchi perfectly.
* Sole Marinière $36.75 (4 of 5) - sautéed fillet of sole, caramelized baby artichokes,
 Manila clams, oyster mushrooms, & coco beans.  The sole was delicious pan fried. It had a crispy outer layer and a soft inner layer. The sole was fresh and very tasty. 
* Moules au Tolouse $28.75 (4 of 5) - Maine bouchot mussels steamed with white wine, Tolouse sausage & tomato oil. The mussels were fresh. The mussels were steamed in a strong white sauce. I absolutely adored the pot it was served-in. There was a metal mesh on one corner of the pot and you could dip your bread into that corner, without brushing the mussels to the side. It was a minor detail, but it was obviously very useful. Rather than having to take all the mussels out or finishing the mussels to get to the white sauce, Bouchon created a nook to dip the bread. And, it doesn't hurt, their complimentary bread, is none other than, their popular Epi Baguette. Yeah for free yummy bread.

I actually like Bouchon Las Vegas more than Bouchon Yountville. I like their restaurant spacing & menu selections in Las Vegas. If you are in the neighborhood of Las Vegas strip, I strongly recommend brunch or dinner at Bouchon.
