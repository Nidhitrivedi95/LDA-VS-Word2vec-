rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Only one word can really sum up this place, disappointing. My girlfriend and I came here for a nice dinner in Vegas, but were very disappointed. This place would have received 3 stars, but the staff and service just wasn't high enough quality to allow me to give them that extra star (more to come). 

Let's start with the food. Ah, Thomas Keller, a California treasure and also an expected knock out dinner. But, I guess you get what you pay for at Bouchon. Price is affordable, and will run you around $50 a person, but the food is forgettable. Where is the rich and luxurious taste that we are all so used to? I had the lamb while my girlfriend had the rainbow trout. The lamb was really gamey, and the trout was a huge filet with nothing notable. The plating lacked effort, and it was just all around disappointing. But, there was something Bouchon did do right, baked good and desserts. The complimentary bread was amazing and the beignets were absolutely delicious. But, I'm here for dinner not dessert, had I known about the food, I would have eaten at Shake Shack first then came to Bouchon for dessert later.

The second issue I have is with the wait staff. Look I am sorry I did not want to order a drink or appetizers, but that doesn't mean we deserve less attention than others. I don't appreciate being given a dessert menu, before you have cleared my dinner dishes, and I also don't appreciate you checking how much I tipped before I left the table. These are all small details,, but I expect better from a Thomas Keller restaurant. 

My dear Thomas, it breaks my heart to say I will... rather I don;t want to return to your restaurant, perhaps if you guys change the executive chef in Vegas I will roll the dice one more time.
