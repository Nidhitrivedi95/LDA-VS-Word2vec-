On entering you can chosse wither the cocktail lounge, with its fantastic display of cocktail shakers or you can enter the main hall and choose from either a drink sitting at the bar or casual or formal dining. The cocktail bar also serves a limited menu mostly sandwiches etc. If you go on a Sunday lunchtime there is usually live music. A great place to go for a break whilst shopping. The club sandwiches are huge and can easily be shared by two. The service is fantastic, especially in the formal area at the back of the hall. If looking for a more formal table best to book ahead
