La Kitchenette - I am absolutely in love with this spot for brunch - little without feeling crowded, a wide-ranging menu that is not overwhelming, but has AMPLE gluten free options. Also fresh orange juice.

The last two times I've eaten here, I've had the crepe with smoked salmon and dill - amazing, and the perfect size for brunch. The coffee is super good too, and the wait staff is quick to offer a refill. The experience is very European, down to being warned about the "very large" portion size for an entree that would count as a half order in most other places.

We've never had difficulty grabbing a table for three or four - and I can imagine we'll be back often!
