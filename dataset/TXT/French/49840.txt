oS96aJIHFWcFAlGHKKXjaw I was instructed to get the almond croissant on my first visit here.  Unfortunately, not a single almond croissant was to be found.  Instead, a very helpful employee explained what my other options were and offered her suggestions.  I had a wonderful apple tart that was a combination of spiced apples and applesauce.

I also bought a baguette, which I heard they are famous for.  I couldn't even make it home without trying a piece (or three).  It was really delicious.  The location is a bit out of the way, but Butler and Lawrenceville are expanding, and I'm excited to see what else is coming!
