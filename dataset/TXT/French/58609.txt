RfsMUrGUJdrpfrU54rmEsQ Food and ambiance is fantastic. So nice to walk into a Gilbert restaurant with no wait. This is a family run restaurant that features French food. The chef is French has has cooked and had restaurants for many year and his expertise shows. Had the Escargot special that was amazing, hint of garlicky with pesto and tomatoes. Just melted in your mouth. The Fromage Board with a chef selection of cheeses was ample and had excellent cheeses. This place is a 10!
