4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Eek! Methinks NOT is right.
Didn't like the food. was WAY too SALTY.
If you heard about the view. Don't Bother, with the Trees, buses and Crowd you will not really Enjoy. So for the Price and Food Quality, Me thinks NOT is right haha. Hope this helps. 
If you are a Local, I would Rather go to Marche Bacchus, at-least you get good Food there.
