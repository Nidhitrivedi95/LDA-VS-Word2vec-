LjOBNcNNpuewBqSPxYYTJQ Today Halloween my son went inside and said Trick or Treat and they told him to pick two cookies then right before getting them he was told he had to pay for them.  How cruel can you be to a child?!?! I will never return to this business again. My son came back to the car crying and upset that he didn't have money and we explained to him that he didn't need money for Halloween. Maybe this business needs to put a sign that they aren't participating in Halloween or have candy because my child was very upset.
