or4UVDjXEEjze3wNPjoAZA I cannot believe the reviews on Yelp.  Here is what you really get.   A very small portion that hardly is enough for a child. Everything is ala cart.  Salad, is very expensive, Side dishes  very expensive, and entries are ridiculous. A small piece of chicken is 30 dollars,  a steak very small is 48 dollars. Service is OK, taste is good, but I would never go there again.
