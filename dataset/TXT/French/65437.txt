u-SvRRAfYgpbXZRfQgcTzA Thank you God for hearing my prayers. Finally a truly fabulous isakaya in Montreal! 

Truly a great place to share delicious authentic Japanese food while downing sake bombs between dishes amongst friends. Decor is simple and trendy. I just wished the music was less loud as it'd be cool to hear the staff greet and thank you in Japanese when you enter/leave the restaurant like they usually do for this type of establishment.

In my own opinion, Imakade kicks Kazu's butt. I am just worried about its location. Imadake is more for the younger crowd, not the stuffy Westmount crowd that would expect overpriced sushi.

Please encourage the owners and run to this restaurant! :P
