ovtlrcsVRlgZZQUlHs_ovw 2nd visit and will definitely return...could easily enjoy a meal just consisting of their awesome side dishes. Have tried two salads now and they have been perfect both times...flavors and types of greens and not drowned in dressing...majority of dressing is sitting on the plate and not on greens. Late night meal and shared a burger with significant other--it was not well done but returned and came back properly cooked...if you like a burger well done ask to have the large patty smashed so it cooks better...flavor was out of this world. I will end up having a lot of favorites from the menu! The hostess is true sweetheart; felt like we were being escorted to the family dining room to share good times. This second time we had a good server...first one didn't seem to remember we were there. Waitstaff is outstanding. Do make reservations...place is gaining popularity and would recommend reservations even for lunch!
