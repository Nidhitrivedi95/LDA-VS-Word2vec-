yU3p0tEBtGuZLTcsBHw9uQ I'm really impressed with this place compared to my last visit at "Ma'tine", the previous owner of the space: 
1. The coffee is now refill-able and the server actually comes say hi within 5-15min to take your order. 
2. The lineup is still huge but at 10:30am, it was still easy to find a table for 2.  
3. On the variety side, the menu is now 3-page long with choices as creative as before. 
4. The taste - grilled cheese with canard confit / pulled pork - are both beyond 4 star! 
What I don't understand is the sauce. The grilled cheese is flavorful enough and they have an extra bowl of bbq sauce for it. The salad is seasoned but they put a range sauce at a side. Also, they threw extra range sauce on top of pickled cabbage that's already good by itself. If you're a light eater, ask to put all those fatty sauce at the side or order something less heavy than grilled cheese (if that exists here! lol).
