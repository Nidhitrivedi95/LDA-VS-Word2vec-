xcmmTXhuMx2fZF2Bt69F4w I don't often give 5-stars to a restaurant, especially in Pittsburgh, but we absolutely LOVE this place!  The food is fantastic.  

Amazing selection of beer and excellent service.

Lots of entrees are good, but my favorites are: 
1. Moules (mussels) are to die for, and the frites (fries) that come with them are delicious.  We prefer the white cream sauce, but all of them are great.  
2. Macaroni Gratin

The only drawback is that it is very tiny and beloved -- because the food is so delicious -- so plan for a LONG wait, come off-hours, or call ahead.

Bon appétit!
