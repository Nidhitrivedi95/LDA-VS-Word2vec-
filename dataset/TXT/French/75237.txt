y0cgy0tTh_C8NWCk0WGgjQ It's a great cozy place, amazing location, AWESOME staff but it's too pricy....

MASSIVE tequila shots. Biggest shots i have ever seen in my life. You could probably use that shot glass as a tiny vase :S.

We had the sangria, white wine. Highly highly recommended - it was friggin delicious!!!!! The calamari we had were in some kind of sweet and spicy chili sauce, i didn't like the sauce at all. It made the calamari soggy and it was so overpowering. Should have just gotten the regular deep fried ones :(.

I wouldn't come here again unless it was the only place close enough to the salsa stage and it was raining.
