BSmqxPbQglQwP2R56OqOag Service was terrific, and we were even comped a desert for being first-timers. However I just couldn't rate this any higher, as the food was mediocre at best. I had no idea bread could be so overcooked it became tougher than shoe leather. My clams were also very over-cooked... seemed like old, frozen clams that were immediately cooked without having been thawed first. A few of them were closer to appropriately cooked. Higher food quality with better ability to prep, and they would have something. NIce ambiance, good service, but I won't go back as there just is no value in the food itself.
