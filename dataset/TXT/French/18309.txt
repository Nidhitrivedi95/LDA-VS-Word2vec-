A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g I am in love with this cafe. It's this cute little jem that's never busy when I'm there. The pastries are delicious. I love the French macaroons or the flan. It's a definite must try. Go to the back counter for the savory items. The sweets are all up front. I usually get mine to go but there are tables to relax and stay a while.
