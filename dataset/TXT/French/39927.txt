K64Uw3a2Enh2MznpwRHWKQ Wanted to take my honey out for her birthday, and noticed a special on travel zoo! Even though my wife is not much about going to a more "classier" restaurant, I was able to talk her into it!! So we put our good clothes on and applied our good perfume or cologne and made our way out to Scottsdale. We arrived about twenty minutes early, but we were seated within minutes. We ordered the chicken scaloppini, and the special of the day Steak and mashed potatoes. We also had the baby mixed green salad. We both loved the salad, especially the roasted garlic vegetable dressing. The steak was cooked to perfection, mashed potatoes were excellent, I actually enjoyed the steamed vegetables. The chicken was alright, since the wife does not like mushrooms, we asked to use a different sauce. I would have loved to try it with the original mushroom sauce!!! Overall we had a different experience we normally do not have, we enjoyed it very much. I am glad my wife had a great time, I knew I was taking a chance but it was worth it. Thanks Razz! For a great time! The only reason we did not give a five star rating was based on the amount of time waiting for our waiter. Even though everyone were very nice, our waiter was very slow on replenishing our water and soda! Yes I said soda! I would come here more often, but it would have to be from a special or coupon.
