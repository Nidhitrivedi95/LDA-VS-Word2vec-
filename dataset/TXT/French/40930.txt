kcF-en40P3J9L8nLy5lKqQ great place for dinner and I love being able to sit on the patio as the day winds down.  As good as their food and service is, I wanted to extend kudos to them for a problem I had.  My credit card showed up with an erroneous charge, and when I called, they investigated and made sure they handled it to my satisfaction.  Nice to have a place that has good food & wine, and is very customer-oriented in every detail !
