pmoIMK8zGWvKsVOPDBYfzg Stellar experience. One of the best rooms in Las Vegas, really intimate.  Service team is fast, functional and most importantly polished. Very high service standards & training. 
New menu features some smaller more approachable bites (try the frog legs, persillade) but still has the rotating Chef driven seasonal entrees as well as the Andre classics. If you have never been the foie gras (ask for a duo of hot cold) Dover & Thermidor are a must.
