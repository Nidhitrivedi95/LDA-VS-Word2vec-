4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Had a great happy hour cocktail and some wonderful starters. I highly recommend the smoked salmon with creme fraiche, red onion and capers. I also really enjoyed the butter lettuce and apple salad! It had a great combination of roasted beets (not usually a fan of, but they pulled it off) with goat cheese and an apple cider vinagrette!  

Food, ambiance and service was fantastic...as usual!!!
