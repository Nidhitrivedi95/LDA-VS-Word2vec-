nkHaix6KenApS8M-liZsCQ My husband and I were given $150 goft card by a group of teachers to show appreciation for a project we did with them. Frankly, we can't afford such expensive eateries so had never been and were slightly intimidated to go, so we saved it for special occasion.  We went ther on 6/3/16.  Decided to savor all the flavors by trying the tasting menu which cost the entire $150 card, but we decided we could afford a bottle of wine to accompany the special dinner.  When time to pay, they denied use of gift card saying it had expired. That hurt, as a couple living on SSI that hurt. So basically Christopher's got paid $150 for nothing and we were stuck with a $250 tab (including tip).  That's a rip off, taking advantage of a school teachers' gift, and two disabled customers.
