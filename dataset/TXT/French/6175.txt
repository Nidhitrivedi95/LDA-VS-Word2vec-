4BBdDw5CUspCRjpwaU4lNA I was here with a group but I had eaten before coming so I only ordered an app and sampled bites of what my friends had invested in. My little mushroom pot was delicious, and since that was all I'd ordered they were nice enough to give me a larger portion than the usual which is why I went with three stars. The service really killed this experience though. When I arrived my friends had been at the table with their bottles of wine for 10 minutes and we waited another 10 before I went over to the waitress and asked for a bottle opener and some water. We were the only people in the restaurant and service continued like this throughout the night. Really exceptionally bad. Desserts were exceptionally good but... you know... a gal cannot live on lavender crème brûlée alone.
