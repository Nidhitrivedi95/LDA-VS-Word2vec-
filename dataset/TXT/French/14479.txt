5EIuCcoHY2evAhFMBV6G6g 5 course dinner here with wine pairings.  I had a super delicious meal here:

Had the baby field greens with smoked duck breast with cranberry. 
Green lip mussels - Served cold.. and super delicious.
Surf and Turf (~ 6-8 oz Filet and half a Maine lobster (maybe 1 or 1 1/4 lb lobster)
Cheese assortment
Black pepper chocolate creme brulee.

If you gotta choose only one appetizer between the salad and the mussels... go for the mussels.  The surf and turf was nicely prepared.  (Steak was perfect at medium rare.)  Lobster was cooked with a ton of butter, so at least be aware if that's not your thing.  I'll eat lobster any which way.. so it's all good.

And the black pepper chocolate creme brulee is something unique.  A nice blend of spiciness and creaminess.  I'm not a big chocolate dessert kind of guy, but this was nice and different.
