oS96aJIHFWcFAlGHKKXjaw Once every semester, I take the hour long bus ride from Oakland to Lawrenceville in order to treat myself to La Gourmandine.

The routine goes something like this:
I wake up early on a Saturday morning (11 am). I get on the bus at noon, and I arrive at La Gourmadine at 1 pm. I wait in line for 15 minutes (because there is ALWAYS a line). And then I order six croissants.

That's right. Six.

And I eat them all in one day.

Its a day of pure bliss. The next day is filled with regret. And a trip to the gym. But it's always worth it.

The croissants are flaky and delicious. The brioche is just the right amount of sweet, but not too much!

Treat yourself to La Gourmandine. You won't be disappointed. However, be sure to have somewhere else to go once you pick up your lovely pastries - they have no seating.
