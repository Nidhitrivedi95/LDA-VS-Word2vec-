mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q 3 stars based on the price-quality ratio.
If u ignore the price, then the food's probably 3.5 stars.

We had the chef's tasting menu.. the price came to USD 400 for 2 of us. The food didnt wow us as we expect a restaurant of such calibre should. We have tasted food better than this at much lower price, not to mention food at this price. 

Of cos, the food was good, especially the asparagus with macaroni gratin, crispy lobster fritter, king crab a la plancha, stuffed quail with foie gras and the coconut mousse on rose champagne granite (these were 4.5 stars) based on taste alone.

Service was great and attentive, but if u come in parties of 2, you will be seated at the counter. We will prefer a table anytime.

Maybe we set our expectations too high after reading the reviews, or maybe we expect more from Joel Robuchen, this is definitely not worth 5 stars.
