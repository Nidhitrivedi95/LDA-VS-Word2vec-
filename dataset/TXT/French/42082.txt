Kut9tVbDX_f7qKMRRoXg3w OMG, this must be the place. Incredible French Bistro, reasonably prices and AWESOME Everything, except the 6 hour drive.

Escargot with duck fat and garlic (best ever), baked Brie with balsamic reduction and dried cranberries, onion soup with Gruyere cheese. Best food for not rich francophile foodies  in Montreal.
