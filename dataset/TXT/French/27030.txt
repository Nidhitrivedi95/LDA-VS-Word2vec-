Dcj69NZJnbJhK-YHP_nULA I have a girlie crush on this place.  It's the perfect spot for a quite night out. We have friends who like to go here with us and it's always fun b/c we share our plates and always have the best time.  We get the steak, 2 frites & mussels, sometimes a salad and app of choice.  The beer and wine selection is wonderful as well. And, I'm so happy that they have expanded and there is more room now!
