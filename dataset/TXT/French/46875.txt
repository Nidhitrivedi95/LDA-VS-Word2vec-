nkHaix6KenApS8M-liZsCQ As a HUGE Broncos fan, I gotta say I was pumped to see the huge orange Crush sign out front of Christopher's Restaurant/Crush Lounge. Definitely got my attention right away! We stopped in for drinks and nibbles and everything was amazing! Brent behind the bar served us up some stiff and extra-dirty martinis and we also ordered the Merguez Sausage with Cous Cous (rustic and spicy!), the Tempura Calamari (thick and flavorful!), and the Terrine of Hudson Valley ABC Foie Gras & Pedro Ximenez Reduction (out of this world!). It was the perfect stop to make before a night out on the town!
