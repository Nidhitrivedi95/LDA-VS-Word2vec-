0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g We were seated immediately upon our arrival. We requested to sit outside so we could watch the Bellagio fountain. They checked on the availability and gladly seated us outside on the patio. The service and the view were amazing!

Now, the food. There were 2 set menus. My husband and I ordered different courses just to try them out. The tasting menu was $15 more expensive but it also had one more course. The presentation of the dishes was very nice. The taste of the food was forgettable. 

I give this place a 4 star for the dining experience. If you are only looking for amazing food, I would not recommend Picasso.
