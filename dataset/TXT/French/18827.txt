Unless you like very sweet things, I would recommend not getting anything with their white chocolate filling.  It was too much.  My macaroon fell apart completely and a lot of it got left on the sidewalk :(

The redeeming quality was their chocolates.  I was sorry we only bought one!  It was some dark chocolate espresso ganache number.  All of the flavors were well balance - the fragrant chocolate and the robust espresso with just a hint of sweet.  I'd go back for the chocolates but definitely not the macaroons.
