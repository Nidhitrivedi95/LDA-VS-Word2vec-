4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Went here for brunch on a Sunday morning. We were sat quickly and promptly met by our server who was friendly and knowledgable. 
I went with the special (eggs Benedict w filet mignon) and my girlfriend went with the quiche. Both we're excellent. 
Eggs Benedict was not smothered in sauce as many places do, the eggs were not over done and the meat was perfect. 

A little pricey, but considering what we've paid for terrible service and food at other locations (LVH), this place is a bargain.
