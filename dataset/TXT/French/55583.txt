rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A First off, we got very very good service because we had booked the private dining room for our party of 10, which came with a personal waiter and busboy team and direct access to the kitchen, so no problems on service.

We started off with 3 orders of the chocolate dusted beignets, that arrived freshly fried to order with a side of two sauces: nutella and a rasberry jam. Fantastic. Fresh and airy, lightly dusted, and with sweet sauces (save the sauces for the bread you'll get later). Which by, the way, is also very good. 

We also ordered a variety of fresh baked goods. i went with the cheese danish (which was a little thicker than I was used to, but still fantastic with creamy cheese in the center), we also had the sticky buns, which was just ridiculously good. Not too dry, not too sweet, perfectly sticky.

Our table ordered a variety which included the Sourdough Waffles with Strawberry, the French Toast (signature dish), the chicken and waffles (with bacon infused batter, which basically tastes like cocaine), and the tuna salad sandwich. Everything was served with decent portions, well executed, clean, and very tasty. I found the sourdough waffles to be light and airy, served with strawberries that were sweet but with that hint of tart, so good that i didn't even have to put syrup on my waffles!

Although I found the prices to be a bit steep ($13 for mimosas and champagnes, although try the French 75 and the hibiscus champagne), we got out of there, with gratuity included, for about $40 a person. The entrees themselves are REALLY affordable, under $15 for most dishes (including $12 for french toast or waffles)

All in all, Bouchon is one of those splurge for fantastic food that borders on art experiences that define Vegas. While I found that everything was excellent, I wasn't completely blown away by anything particular that said to me "this is the best ____ I've ever had". Still, definitely come here and give it a try!
