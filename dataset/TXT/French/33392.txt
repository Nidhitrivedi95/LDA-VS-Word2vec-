OVERVIEW: Arrived to the cafe around lunch time. Not the best idea. Very very limited seating, you'd be lucky to walk in a find a seat with the lads. When the owner is in the cafe, you will receive outstanding service. The sandwiches are absolutely amazing. Wether you're ordering a breakfast or lunch sandwich you will not be disappointed. I ordered a egg and spinach as well as a chipotle chicken sandwich.The food is definitely the best part about this cafe, the coffee is just "OK." I ordered a cappuccino, and it was definitely nothing to die for. Always look forward to stopping into this cafe when I am around.
