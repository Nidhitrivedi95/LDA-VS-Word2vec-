It is easy to make a reservation for the day of, so if you are a last minute planner like us, at least you can rest assured that you will have a nice place to dine on the strip!

Although the interior of the restaurant looks upscale and all the servers are outfitted in dress pants and vests, it is actually a very casual dining atmosphere. The menu consists of an assortment of salads, seafoods, and steaks, and although the options are limited, it shouldn't be hard to find a dish for everyone. 

At the end of the meal, our server brought the bachelorette a cream puff/ice cream dessert on the house, which I thought was a really sweet gesture. It was just enough to pass around the table and for all of us to try a bite. Delish! :)
