LHwzyN5cllTfLuZ8v2k_Bg Absolutely brilliant!


 You MUST reserve a table here if you expect to eat on a Thurs, Fri, Sat as this place is popular and well known for it's extremely good cuisine and extremely reasonable prices.


 I had a wonderful meal here with a stunning wine and it was not too expensive. While we did not have a reservation, we were able to get a table at the front which, while drafty is at least a table at this magnificent place.


 The traditional French menu is a delight and the wait staff are perfect.


 I would not hesitate to recomment this to my best friends, and hide it from my enemies :-)
