SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ Love the outside seating, our local friends picked this spot as an introduction to our mini vacation.  Also really enjoyed the ahi tuna entree.  The kale salad was delicious and the wine list offered plenty to choose from.  Appetizers of bison tartar and also mussels was yummy.  We enjoyed the beautiful October evening and really took it all in.  Our server was competent and casual just adding to the fun evening.  Price point was solid but worth it for such a memorable evening.
