As other reviewers have mentioned it was WAY too difficult to get the server's attention for even the simple things like refilling the water glass and getting the check. My boyfriend ordered the flank steak and was never actually asked how he wanted it cooked, however after a substantial wait for the food he finally cut into the middle and it was totally raw! When we were finally able to flag down the server and show her the poorly cooked meat, she said that she had requested it be cooked "medium," but agreed that it was quite raw. She simply apologized and then said that if we told her before she would have put it back on the grill, but it was too late which was only more infuriating since getting her attention was such a challenge. She then cleared his plate leaving the entire center portion of his steak uneaten (a $24 dish) and although no compensation was requested, none was offered either. My veal tortellini was nothing to rave about and the escargot appetizer was underwhelming. 

This place is expensive for the service and quality you are getting.  A short jaunt up the street and you have a number of other fabulous options like L'Express that is in the same price range, but far exceeds the experience at this cafe.
