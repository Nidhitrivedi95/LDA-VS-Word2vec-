T4shscbr3BU3yb6EA3BSfA My wife and I went there for dinner on a Friday evening.  We were lucky to get a reservation just a few hours in advance, though for a late dinner. The staff was friendly and the waitress helped us our way through the French only menu (we are anglophones). We ordered The carrot soup and sturgeon fish sausage for appetizers. They were both excellent; carrot soup wasn't too sweet, yet with enough carrot flavor. Fish sausage was quite unique and fishy. We ordered Arctic char and catfish for mains. I highly recommend the catfish - very fresh and with nice sauce. Our dessert was rhubarb sorbet. Overall, a great experience! It's on the expensive side, but has an amazing value; we impressed with the amount of food and quality and didn't feel ripped off after :).
