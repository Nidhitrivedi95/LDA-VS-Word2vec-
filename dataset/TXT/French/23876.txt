cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg I would recommend going with people so you can order more.

My hungover eyes ordered more than I could eat.

Skip the APC beer because it's a lame adjunct lager. Order anything else.

The little foie croquettes are a fun experience of exploding liquid foie in your mouth. The pickled tongue I could have passed on.

The French onion soup is classic, although with chunk of pork fat inside.

The pork chop special was killer with the most wonderful and colorful tomatoes surrounding the dish.

The duck fat fries were decent, although if I came with people, I would make them foie poutine or regular poutine fries.

There was no wait for myself on a Friday night. The waiter was extremely kind. He was humble about his English, but I understood him perfectly.

A fine meal. I ordered too much and paid about $70. I think a person can reasonably spend $50-60.
