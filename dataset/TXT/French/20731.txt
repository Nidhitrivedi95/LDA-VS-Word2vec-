AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw Very glad we visited in our tour of Vegas pastry.

The almond croissant was delicious! It wasn't especially croissant-y, though, more scone-ish. Still, I loved every more-tender-than-flakey bite. The almond paste inside was so good, not too sweet.

The dining partner ordered a chocolate hazelnut cake. I scarfed what he could not finish. It was obviously made with good chocolate.

Now, be warned: DO NOT ORDER A CREPE. They are not good here, and you will be missing what this shop does best.

I am heartbroken to learn too late that the giant egg dispenses free chocolates. If only I had known...
