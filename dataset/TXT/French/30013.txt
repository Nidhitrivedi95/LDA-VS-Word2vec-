fNCyfJOfd2R42hkhz2tALQ First off, it's conveniently located only a couple blocks from the old port, and a couple steps off both metro square victoria and bonaventure.

For the food, my wife and I shared the 20oz bone in ribeye for 2, whcih included a salad, green beans and unlimited frites (fries) as well as some special sauces for dipping. The overall menu is limited, maybe 8 main course options that include duck confit, salmon, filet mignon, rib steak and others.  Appetizers include calamari, French onion soup, escargot, etc.  We had the soup and escargot...delicious.   Service was also exceptional, they were friendly and responsive.  I wore jeans, and when we went they were playing a hockey game on tv, so pretty casual overall. 

The best part is it's byob, and their is an SAQ in the old port and a couche tard across from bonaventure metro stop.  

With appetizer, tax and tip, figure about $50 per person. Would go again and recommend to a friend.  Provided 4 stars because they did not offer for us to take home the left overs, instead they just took everything.
