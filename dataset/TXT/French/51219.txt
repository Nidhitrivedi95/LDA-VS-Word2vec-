P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ Sooo what do you do when you hit a Royal Flush at video poker? You blow it on a fantastic meal!

We probably would have eventually made it here anyway since we love experiencing French cuisine. The spontaneity of the moment made for a really lovely evening though.

The restaurant was quite empty...and quiet. Maybe it just seems like that since the tables are set far apart for ambiance.  I even got a little chair for my clutch.

We ordered the signature menu and each dish was an experience. Never will I forget the blue soup. NATURALLY colored. It really takes imagination and skill to create that.

It was nice to have some foie gras, since it's been banned in California. All of the delicacies showed up in unexpected ways that made for a truly unique meal. 

My advice... if you come, order the signature menu and keep your tastebuds open to new experiences. Also, get wine pairings!
