jSfnItqaOnEp2nenVF7fCg My son and I stopped by on a Saturday afternoon and easily got seated.  I am originally from Columbus Ohio and we had many wonderful restaurants that are privately owned and have outstanding food.  I have not be overly fortunate to find good meals since moving to Phoenix three years ago.  I read some reviews and decided to stop by.  My son and I both enjoyed our lunch very much.  I had the Parisian Baguette and he had the Caprese with a side salad.  The salad doesn't have much dressing as is mentioned in other reviews but I didn't think it needed anymore than what was offered on it. The greens and candied pecans were fresh and full of flavor.  I think too many people are accustomed  to drowning their salads in dressing.  The sandwiches were very good.  You could actually smell the freshness of the tomato when the server set the plates down.  The flavors worked well together.  The only issue is the interior of the restaurant.  I have yet to be there in the evening but it would be nice if they put out the white tablecloths and had nice lighting to at least add to the experience.  They are working with what they have in the storefront so maybe in days to come they can get a venue that matches the quality of the food.  It's much better than the chains that surround the area.  We'll be back!
