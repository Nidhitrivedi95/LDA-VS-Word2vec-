My husband jokes saying we just spent in one meal the equivalent of a year of food at McDonald's. Food is very good. I tried things I wouldn't usually try. Towards the end there was a huge table celebrating their parents 10 year anniversary they were very drunk and annoying. It took away from the "5 star experience" they should have a drink limit for people otherwise it won't be classy anymore which it wasn't. The overall experience could be better.
