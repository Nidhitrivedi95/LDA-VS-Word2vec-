gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg it was roughly twelve thousand degrees out and my husband and I were in serious need of some air conditioning and cold beer. It really wasn't even that cold in the place and I asked if they had AC on, but it was comfortable for a short while. The beer was good, not great. I thought the blonde version had a nice fruity note to it and the brown beer was described as my husband as "okay." 

My chicken wrap sandwich was nearly inedible. After a couple bites, I had to stop. The nachos were....nachos. Nothing more to say here. There are probably much better places to eat but I wouldn't say no to stopping in for a drink.
