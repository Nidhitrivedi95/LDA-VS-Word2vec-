l09JfMeQ6ynYs5MCJtrcmQ The food was okay, and for a reunion dinner it seemed like a great place, since the last times we went it was good. Tonight it was not. The service was terrible, we actually had to ask to receive bread (2x), they brought the wrong entree, and then charged for both the correct one and the wrong one. The entire service took 2+ hours. Not impressed. I'm not sure if they were short-staffed, but it will definitely be a while before I chance it again.
