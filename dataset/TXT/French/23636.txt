cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg The epitome of French food. 

This is a must must must must see.  

I had the Fois Gras poutine. Very good balance. Dont expect a huge quebec style poutine. Expect a balance of fois gras and fries. 

Then the most amazing Tagliatelle i've had. Rustic cut with Rabbit and Fois Gras. With shaved cheese on top. If you want delicious, if you want decedant.....just wow. 

The only problem i had was that they have SO many specials for the night that were told orally by the waiter that it was hard to follow. The waiter was so nice. We were from Toronto and he was welcoming and very polite and patient. 


OH and fresh baked bread!!
