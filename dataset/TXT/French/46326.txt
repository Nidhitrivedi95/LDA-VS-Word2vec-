The presentation was the eye-candy that was just as pleasantly tasteful as the food itself.  The ambiance was classy yet casual.   Great staff that explained each meal and wine description.  And Ohhhh, the dessert!  Speechless with the variety of sweet and semi-sweet pastries that was perfectly combined on a slate slab.  I have traveled and dined at very fine restaurants,  Decca77 dining experience should be a "bucket-list" item for those who can appreciate genuine find dining.
