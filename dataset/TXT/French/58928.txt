rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w We were here to celebrate our friends birthday and with the location, we already expected to pay a pretty penny for it. I haven't dined much at French restaurants so to me the food tasted fine. My main entree was the foie gras stuffed chicken and it tasted great.

I called ahead to order a cake for the occasion. They will take the cake order, with your choice from their list of flavors, and the cake will be delivered to the restaurant and ready to serve at the end of your meal. The cake is $48 for 8 inch. It will be added to your bill. 

The service was great. We were greeted kindly since the moment we walked in. Our waiter Martin , the only red headed waiter in the restaurant, was super attentive and entertaining. 

At the end of your meal, they give each guest a small present to take with them. 

The portions are small, but enough for us. Though some may want more food later on at night.
