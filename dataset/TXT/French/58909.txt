That's probably the best way I can describe my recent visit to Le Cirque but I would say the food was pretty darn good too. We chose this place for our last night in Las Vegas, a pre-cursor to the famous O show at the Bellagio hotel. After catching the spectacular and dazzling water fountain show, we made our way inside. The decor is eclectic, imagine a heavily French circus with cute little monkeys printed on the plates. Our server was extremely helpful and friendly, offering recommendations and even accommodating our dietary needs (no pork or alcohol). Husband ordered off the Dégustation Menu (5 course), I order A La Carte (3 course). Honestly between his choices and mine plus the free chestnut soup, amuse bouche and pre desserts, I counted about 10 different courses (example of good service: for every dish where he got one and I didn't they placed an extra plate besides me so we could share!). And the desserts, don't even get me started on the desserts. Pure chocolate heaven. And pre dessert I mentioned? Lemon sorbet with Pop Rocks. Pop Rocks! At a 5 diamond star restaurant. Simply brilliant. They were also really good with timing and mindful of our theatre tickets so everything came out at a good pace. Overall a wonderful experience, yes it's pricey but once in awhile you gotta splurge on yourself. And the view from our table of the water show only added to the ambiance.
