VwZhwflLnTq19aAeFLJHCQ Ordered the New York, it was cooked well but the flavor didn't quite match and the mushrooms didn't look fresh.  

The seating was cramped and I was rubbing elbows with my party and it was generally uncomfortable to sit.  

Green valley has quite a few small eateries, but this one is slightly overpriced for the quality of food and seating arrangements.
