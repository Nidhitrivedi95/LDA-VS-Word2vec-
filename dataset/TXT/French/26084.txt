d482l58ho0_IMdFkXX1F5Q Last nite in Vegas, was not super hungry but wanted to try something new.  Really excellent place with incredible food!  Caesar Salad with a new twist that was superb, French flatbread that is kind of like a super thin pizza, complimentary bread of two kinds, French Onion soup that again had a twist to it, dessert of gelato and lemon cakes, all very fresh and nothing like similar items I have tasted before.  Will definitely return here on our next trip!
