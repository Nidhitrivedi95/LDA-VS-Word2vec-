JFfZDmNAoa_MHG16K2BY6A The food was delicious, the ambiance was lovely and the service, while not the best I've ever had, was acceptable.  We were a chaotic group of eight, with people arriving in ones and twos over the course of an hour.  The staff took it all in stride.

It was, I believe, an owner who was serving us.  I chose a wine from Chinon, mentioning to my friends that I had spent time time there on vacation, and our server mentioned that that is where "we" are from, which I took to mean the proprietors.  Chinon is a small town in the Loire Valley, thus the restaurant's name.

I had chicken liver pate, which I knew would be rich, but nothing could have prepared me for the melt in your mouth beauty of this particular plate.  And it was a massive portion.  Two sort of gelato-scoop curls, which I shared with my companions.  Said companions were my husband's work colleagues, so they were shy about sharing, but the tastiness of the pate had some of them coming back for second and third tastes, propriety be damned.  Even so, some of it went uneaten it was so insanely, devlishly rich.  

My main was salmon, which was served on what looked like stir-fried rice, as in what you'd get in a cardboard container from a Chinese takeout joint.  It didn't look especially appealing but I had high hopes, expecting that a French take on fried rice might be tasty.  Alas, it was a bit boring and a bit too salty.  The salmon, however, was fabulous.  

After my pate starter I opted out of dessert but my companions raved about theirs.  

I would definitely go back, for the interesting wine list (interesting French and non-French options, interesting and non-interesting prices), wonderful food, good service and lovely atmosphere.
