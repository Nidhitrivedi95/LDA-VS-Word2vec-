dd3GZs6zW2t7BM0cbxAzvg I feel like I am giving a good amount of 5 star reviews lately, however, I have been so impressed with the food in Toronto and this place is A MUST.  It was one of the better
experiences I have had in a long time. Sure, I had great company with me, but in addition, the ambiance and the cuisine was fantastic.

We started with the escargot. I can't say I loved the way it was served, meaning, the escargot was still inside the shell and you simply had to pull it out. Regardless, the taste and garlic butter sauce was perfect.

So here is the thing. I spent time in Buenos Aires, Argentina where you would never put a sauce on a steak so I understand if some people don't believe this is the way a steak should be served. That being said, the steak I had at "La Palette" with its sweet  (not to sweet) and perfectly detailed sauce, was one of the best steaks I have ever had in my life.

I have joked with my friend that I will fly back to Toronto, just for that steak. 

I LOVED this place!
