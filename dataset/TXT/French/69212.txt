w2tr0PA0b3tg8pId0kjM-A Gaby et Jules,  Je taime!  How can I describe the majesty of a perfectly made macaron...  I don't know, but I will try.  
First off, I am not a sweets person.  I would rather have an extra piece of meat or bread at the end of a meal, instead of dessert.  That being said, I had the honor and privilege of tasting one of Gaby et Jules macarons at a food event and they were FABULOUS!  

After that tasting, my daughter, (Nicknamed Muff) begged me to take her to the actual patisserie in Squirrel Hill.  Indulgent mother that I am, we set our sights on the jewelry cases containing some of the finest macarons to be had in the country!  Yes, I said country!  I've had macarons at places said to be "famous" for their macarons and the macarons at Gaby et Jules outshone them by a long shot.  

For someone who isn't into sweets to actually say that they dream of salty carmel or lovely raspberry macarons, is to say a lot!  To eat a whisp of flavored air and have it envelope your tongue in ethereal loveliness... Ah, what glory they are!  I can't wait to go back for more...
