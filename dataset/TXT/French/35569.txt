htQgj-ANQpZGpIpkkrEmyQ Came here due to a recommendation by a friend. It's a bit out of the way from my usual spots for food but I am glad I made the small journey.

Situated in the beautiful Main Street Markham, this restaurant is nested among historic buildings and boutique shops.

The food here is visually stunning and extremely tasty. They have a great fusion theme and they combine ingredients that you don't normally see together into something truly special.

A cute side note, they buy special beer and sell them as "surprise me" - a nice little differentiator that is a testimonial to their core value to be innovative and delightful.
