27vF5LESbv4kFQfHZUDCnw My cousin heard about this bakery opening up, and we finally got a chance to go. The decor of the place is very inviting and rustic, and their displays were very attractive.

After a long time making up our minds, we opted to get 1 of their cakes and 2 eclairs to share (we had just had a large brunch). I asked them to pack a 3rd eclair in a to-go box since buying 3 eclairs is cheaper than buying individually ($3.75 each or 3 for $10). My BFF got to enjoy this later.

Matcha framboise, $6.50: This was really good. It is (I think) a green tea mousse cube surrounded by a layer of raspberry mousse. The outside is slightly hardened, like those marshmallows that are a little hard. Presentation is very  nice and the flavours complimented each other. It is not a heavy dessert at all and I highly recommend it, despite the high price point.

Chocolate passionfruit eclair: Only okay. The eclair was a little tough/hard as if it could have been day old. The icing on top was like an almond fondant, which was not mentioned in the flavouring. Flavours were nothing amazing. My BFF did not comment on it so I believe he did not enjoy it either.

Pistachio cherry eclair: A huge let down. There was not much pistachio taste and essentially no cherry taste. I think they meant to have the pistachio cherry on the top and the inside of the eclair was just regular custard.

Washrooms are downstairs and very clean.

I might come back to try the croissants, as I heard that they are to die for. Apparently, when you bite into it, you will instantly be brought to a cafe Paris, according to my boss. Too bad I didn't think to ask him before I went!
