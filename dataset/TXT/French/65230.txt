u-SvRRAfYgpbXZRfQgcTzA My family loved it here - young and old!  You walk in and it looks like a typical Japanese izakaya place - a trendy bar type of decor.

As soon as we sat down and ordered drinks, I ordered my son's ramen.  The waiter came back to get our order, and was honest in telling us that we probably ordered too much (my husband walked in hungry and over -ordered!). He very patiently helped us to narrow down our order, and it turned out to be a perfect amount for us.  Our food came out as soon as each dish was ready and it worked out very well for us - especially the ramen that came out early for my toddler.  Here's what we had:

- my son's pork belly ramen with original broth (made with meat bones) - a very good, rich broth with chewy noodles, very tasty pork and bamboo shoots, and bean spouts.  There was a delicious looking half of an egg in there too but my son ate it all so I cannot testify as to how good it was.
- the special dish of soba noodles wrapped in seaweed with (tempura?) shrimp inside, and the whole thing was fried.  This was an unusual dish, but it surprised me because I loved it, especially with the sauce it was served with.
- sea bass marinated in miso for three days - YUM.  You must order this.
- my black sesame seed ice cream was THE BEST of it's kind I've ever had.  It's opaque black, not the weak looking versions I've tried at home. As my dad said in Chinese, "it's very fragrant", which means the flavor is very good.  You must also order this...!

All of the following were delicious small plates that we'd order again:
- beef cooked on a hot stone
- skewered chicken
- skewered chicken with plum sauce
- skewered sausage
- grilled squid
- vegetable tempura

This place served us a great parting dinner in the form of many small and delicious plates to share.  If we lived in Montreal, I can tell you that my husband and I would be regulars here.
