Ycp3Agr7dt71TZkeKV7jng I work by Le Gourmand and they've ordered trays of their baked goods/pastries and coffee multiple times and everything is so delicious. I've tried pretty much anything I can get my hands on and it's all been good. Even the desserts that don't look like much, and looked really simple are very good. The coffee has been great too!

I would totally recommend them for both
I should try lunch there one day...
