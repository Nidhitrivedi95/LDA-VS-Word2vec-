kKC7UTcHZM3zLfT97x3msg Came here with the manfriend and his parents for a casual but refined night, and it was absolutely lovely. Cozy atmosphere, kind servers and delicious food.

Homemade chestnut pasta, seafood platter, salad and more - every dish we ordered was delicious, thoughtfully executed and worth savouring each bite. I love that the quality of food and service wasn't eclipsed by any sort of attitude or pomp.

Would absolutely come back again soon.
