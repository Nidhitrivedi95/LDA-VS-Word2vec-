OkC86YtZ0Nm19my5F4GGrQ I've been here many times over the years and the food has never disappointed. 

I love the Old River area and this restaurant fits in perfectly with the area. The restaurant is dim and cozy inside with only about a dozen tables. During the summer seating is increased a bit by a small patio of outdoor seating. There is also a small bar with seating that spans the length of the restaurant. 

Everything I've had here has been excellent. The Tartines are always delicious with crunchy bread, plenty of meat, and covered in cheese. All of the salads I've had are really good and include many good ingredients. My favorite was the Frisee, but that wasn't on the menu on my most recent visit. Of course the French Onion Soup is a signature item since they are a French restaurant and for good reason.

On my most recent visit, a Sunday, Tartine was offering a Sunday Supper special. Three courses for $25 with a couple of options for an additional $5. This was a great deal so my friend and I both ordered from that menu. 

The Mixed Berry Salad was light and refreshing with mixed berries and a light vinaigrette topping. The Scallops were perfectly prepared and the rice risotto underneath was to die for. The seasoning on the risotto was fantastic and there were nicely prepared vegetables mixed in. The Lemon Tart was okay with a nice tart lemon filling, but the outer part was a light shell instead of a thick crust. My friend ordered the Half Chicken which looked fantastic with a nice cherry sauce and plenty of vegetables on the side. She really enjoyed her meal and plenty to take home as leftovers as well.

I've always come to Tartine for the food and just kind of forgiven the service. Service isn't awful, but it has never been overly friendly or great either. I've been there no less than a couple dozen times and have never been wow'd by service.
