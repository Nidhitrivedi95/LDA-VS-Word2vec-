cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg If you like food, you must come here. If you at all consider yourself a foodie, you must come here. If you like yourself as a person, you must come here. If you are alive, you must come here. Just come.

I don't know how much I can add to all of these other reviews, but this place seriously merits each of its five stars. From the cromesquis to the duck in a can to the special dish that's not on the menu (the plogue a champlain), everything is delicious at this place. Including dessert. Oh yeah, make sure to save room for dessert. The chomeur pudding was heavenly, as was the pot de creme. And both came in easily shareable portions. Too often are desserts neglected at good restaurants, but definitely not here.

So come here, sit down, and eat. Eat as much as you can, and then eat some more. Then revel in what you just ate and how life will never be the same.

Note: Reservations are crucial! In March, we were able to get a table a couple of days in advance.
