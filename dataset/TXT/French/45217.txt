mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q I STILL HAVE YET TO EAT ANYWHERE BETTER THAN L'ATELIER DE JOEL ROBUCHON.

I mean there is the Mansion by Joel Robuchon right next door. But let's talk about L'atelier for now.

When I first walked in I really didn't know what to expect. The kitchen is right dab in the middle of the restaurant. So my friends and I sat by the bar. Service was a complete 10/10. The waiters do not skip a beat. Everyone works together and food is up to the minute. I didn't know what to order really because I was knew to this whole fine dining experience. I just went with the Menu Decouverte. It was $135 and my knees were buckling BUT I can tell you this. I don't regret spending ONE RED CENT. So here is what I ordered:

for my L'amuse Bouche I had cucumber gelee with tarragon and cumin yogurt.

Blue Fin Tuna with tomato infused olive oil, scallops cooked in the shell with seaweed infused butter, egg cocotte with mushroom cream, light chestnut veloute with carmelized foie gras and crispy bacon, slightly smoked salmon with confit potatoes, free range quail stuffed with foie gras with Robuchon's infamous Pomme Puree (his version of mashed potatoes) They simply melt in your mouth and is the equivalent of eating butter and a Hanger steak with fried shallots.

for dessert.. i went with the sheep's milk yogurt panna cota.

For the best chef in the last decade? I definitely would make it a point to put this restaurant on your TO EAT list.
