sARavfidmIS878q5BtlyVQ Entertaining, fanciful, imaginative, and quite delicious, é by José Andrés is one of the best dining experiences! 

I had the pleasure of enjoying their tasting menu with a wine pairing. There were 21 different tastes on this night, though the menu changes seasonally. Some of the courses were outstanding and highly memorable, but still all were quite enjoyable on this incredible evening with my love. This was not necessarily the best meal I've had at this price point, but it was certainly the most fun, most memorable, and one of the all around most enjoyable experiences I've ever had.

Some of my favorite tastes of the evening included:
Raya
Platija
Oysters & Caviar
Live Scallop
Cotton Candy Empanada with Foie 
Wagyu Ribeye
Intxausalsa

As many who frequent this website know, é is moderately difficult reservation to make based only on the small intimate dining experience that seats 8 or 9 people at a time. They have two seatings a night--doubling your opportunity to get in!!!...but obviously still very limited. I first reached out to them several months in advance. They weren't able to take my reservation at that time as it was outside the three month range, but they shared the reservation process with me. Later, when the date was now three months out, I emailed them and found the method practical and easy to use.

I was thoroughly impressed with é by José Andrés. The food is playful and whimsical at é. The setting reveals a jovial look into the mind of José Andrés. The experience is an affair uniquely encountered...an event unto itself. I'm not sure I would recommend é by José Andrés if you rarely dine at this price point...admittedly, there are better options if it's just about food and service. Then again, I don't know if there is a Vegas food experience I would rather participate in annually more than é.
