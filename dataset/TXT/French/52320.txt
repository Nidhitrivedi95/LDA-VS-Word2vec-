pwnz4O5LFxv2OBEy0UCjtw I was so excited for this place.  They did a great job decorating it and I peeked in the windows pretty often while it was under construction. 

I don't like the weak menu.  I really WANTED it to have bacon and eggs, which they don't.  This might be a problem with me, just wanting what I can't have... but it really deflated my joy when I saw a collection of sandwiches and pastries on the menu and no hot breakfast options, save crepes.  I just expected... more.

The good:
- I had a raspberry scone, which was good
- The ambiance and decor was good
- they were playing good music
- there are steps which discourages strollers (although it's not like steps are an impenetrable fortress of stroller haven)

The bad:
- limited menu
- busy at lunchtime
- no hot breakfasts
- basically NOTHING has bacon, which blows

Would I go back here?
Maybe if they changed their menu and added stuff that I like (like bacon),
