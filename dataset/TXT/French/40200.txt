KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA I agree with Michelle C.'s review. I went there with some friends just a few nights ago. First of all, we specifically asked for a particular table right by the water when we made our initial reservations and we even called the day of to confirm this table again. When we got there, we were told that our table was not available. The owner said she would see if the patrons at our table would be willing to move, but there were no guarantees. We graciously agreed to take another table. 

Aside from a relieved smile and a simple "thank you" there were no other acknowledgments over this mishap that could have been prevented with better planning on the part of the restaurant's management team. 

Then we were charged $25 as a corkage fee for EACH bottle we brought in to drink. Corkage fees north of the strip are now illegal, but I guess it's an easy thing to ignore if you think your customers are not too savvy about new culinary laws. 

Again, we were gracious and paid our bill. However, when we spoke to the owners about our dissatisfaction all they did was give us blank stares to our faces but made sure to roll their eyes when they thought our backs were turned. That, was just too much. How unprofessional!
