AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw i have heard that chef payards place here at caesars was amazing so i tried it out for brunch on my bday this year.  i must say paying almost 80 dollars for breakfast is a bit ridiculous. the bistro was really charming though. i liked the ambience a lot.

the eggs benedict of course was what i ate. and yes it was the best i have ever had. perfectly poached eggs.. the canadian bacon was good and their hollandaise sauce was everything i imagined. 

the service was kinda blah. snooty waiters, but i expected that. i also went to the pastry shop. lots of amazing desserts but i settled for the french maccaroons.. sooo good!!!! 

so if you want a fancy brunch its a really cute place to go. but be prepared to pay extravagantly. its good but i feel like thier price point is too high for the product.
