jaSowNITPRRCYpPb3_pjdA Inattentive service. Inspite of Ample staffing. No offer to refill water. Beignets served without cutlery. Overall mediocre food at $$$ prices. 
No bowl provided for mussel shells.
Came at lunch Sunday.
Child's menu found on colouring sheet but<U+200B> waiter made no mention of it.
