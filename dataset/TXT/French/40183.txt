KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA My wife and I decided to try this place for the first time for lunch. We were seated by the hostess within 5 minutes and had a nice view of the water.  My wife ordered the carrot soup and Cesars salad. She enjoyed both. I had a taste of her shrimp salad which was delicious. I ordered the classic seafood bouilabaisse. I was very disappointed as the server brought it to our table I noticed it had pasta which a classic seafood bouilabaisse does not contain pasta.  Also only had 3 shrimps 3 mussels, 3 clams it had very minimal seafood for  $24. and had no octopus as described on the menu. So as the polite waiter named Bradley checked on us. I told him It was served with pasta and didn't not have any octopus as the menu stated.  So he went to ask the cook and shortly returned to tell us they ran out of octopus last night. I just wish I would have known that prior to ordering as we gave up pasta for lent. I would have ordered the Cesars salad instead. In the future I feel you should let your customers know if your missing items to complete the dish to inform your paying customers.
