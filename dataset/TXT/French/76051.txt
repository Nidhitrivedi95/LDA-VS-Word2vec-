ynYEgNimJOyb8dvyr9x0sA Despicable service. Went in there on a Sunday and restaurant was empty (1st red flag) and was seated by one rude hostess. 

Proceeded to be seated with our 18 month old who was a bit fussy to get in his high chair and that's when the condescending stares begun (2nd red flag) but went in on the assumption that it was kid friendly from yelp but oh no...not even close.

 Continued to be optimistic since it was a quiet Sunday. Big mistake. The manager (assuming since he was not uniformed)  made it obvious that we and our children were not welcome making a condescending comment about their establishment  was "not a chuck and cheese or mcdonalds".  Very true, those have customers and better service yet. 

Sorry but at that point we walked out, luckily only having ordered our drinks.  I've had bad food and bad service before but nothing that was more worthy of a despicable review than this place. 

Please update to denote this place is NOT kid friendly (or has anything resembling  customer service).
