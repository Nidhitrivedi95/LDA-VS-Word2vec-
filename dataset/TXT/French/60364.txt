SBnpT6JDbah-5l_52GM5sw My party of three enjoyed dinner at Sardine on a surprisingly busy Tuesday night.  Cocktail menu was inventive and prices are similar to other Madison cocktail bars.  We tried the charcuterie plate and while it was good, there could have been a bit more to it or at least more crostini for the duck liver mousse.  Our server recommended the duck confit salad.  That, with another small plate, could have definitely been a meal in itself.  It was delicious, but the bacon vinaigrette definitely added some greasiness to the salad.  Salmon, steak frites and pork tenderloin were our entrees and they were all very flavorful.  

Our server was polite, attentive and helpful.  I agree with other reviewers that the service seemed a bit slow; we waited awhile for our entrees.  All in all, it's a welcoming space with a cozy atmosphere and lovely food.
