u-SvRRAfYgpbXZRfQgcTzA I've tried my fair share of japanese restaurants in Montreal and this is the closest I've gotten to authentic japanese food. I don't understand how some people could have been disappointed by the okonomiyaki because this was the best one I've had since I came back from Japan. I also highly recommend their gyoza and yakisoba. It's a little bit loud as other reviewers have mentioned but it should be expected in that kind of restaurant, and the service definitely made up for it. I was impressed to see that the menu was vegetarian friendly (I had a hard time finding veggie okonomiyaki until then), and they have a good selection of drinks as well. I would definitely come back!
