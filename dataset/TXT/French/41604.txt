kKC7UTcHZM3zLfT97x3msg We went there on a snowy Sunday evening so it was a little quiet. The food was.. incredible. I got the steak and my wife got the rack of lamb... both were so tender and juicy. Cooked perfectly with great presentation. The sides were all delicious. Service was also super welcoming. We ordered two cocktails each (one was a Jalapeno based spirit that I highly recommend). 

Overall, it's pricy but totally worth it. Highly recommended.
