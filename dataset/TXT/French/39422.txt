jSfnItqaOnEp2nenVF7fCg I came here for lunch. They have decent food. Husband got the meatloaf sandwich, which he raved about. It was $10.99. I got the "Cabernet burger ($12)" and the "Quiche Lorraine ($9.50)". The burger was not worth the price. The Quiche was good, but again, I had better quiche for half that price. The salad that comes with with the quiche is a spring salad mix and its very fresh. We'll come back here maybe twice a year when we don't know what else to eat.
