9ot8oInkYZTt6wkkGe__vQ I went there for lunch for the summerlicious.  They seem to be prepared with the expected higher volume.  So the food came out fast.  The service was good.  The food were delicious.  When the meal came out, I wish the portion is a little bigger.  But after the 3-course, I was full (and not overly stuffed).  The chicken is a little bit dry.  Maybe because it's white meat.  Other than that, everything is yummy.  The decor is nice too.  $25 for 3-course meal (summerlicious fixed prix).  Good deal.
