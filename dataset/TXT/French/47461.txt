O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q Went here for breakfast because we were staying at the hotel and had a coupon. Why not? I love love love the white table cloths and the general clean lighting of this restaurant. The breakfast was about what I expected but I suppose that is a good thing! Could've been way worse! Just went with the All American breakfast which is pretty much 2 eggs, toast, and your choice of meat (sausage, bacon, etc.) We did order the Sugar Doughnuts. Wow. Amazing! The waitstaff was a little snooty but friendly enough to earn their tips. Not my top 5 and not that one-of-a-kind service I've experienced before, but the food was decent and sure, I'd go back...that is, once I've tried every other restaurant Vegas has to offer. :)
