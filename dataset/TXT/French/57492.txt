rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I was staying in the Venetian for a conference I was attending. My colleague and I are big breakfast fans and we didn't need to be to work until around 11 so we got some brunch here. Oh. My. God. This is seriously the best breakfast place I've ever been to. The first time I went I had the hash and eggs. Homemade corned beef hash is my weakness. It was perfectly done, the eggs were perfectly cooked, and the brioche toast just put it over the top. Oh yeah, and the coffee is AMAZING. And they're not stingy with it either. I even went back the last day of my trip by myself because I had to go one more time. I got the brioche french toast with Tahitian vanilla butter, candied walnuts and strawberries. It was fantastic. I had to keep myself in check to prevent from have a When Harry Met Sally moment all by myself. No breakfast place will ever be as good as this for me from now on.
