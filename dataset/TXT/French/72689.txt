XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q Absolutely fantastic in every way!   Service is impeccable.   Food spectacular.  Wine list is awesome, William can definitely help you pick a great wine. Intimate setting, perfect for a date. The fried egg in phylo dough was definitely a crowd pleaser.  The poulet fermier is a must, and yes, I know it is chicken...but it will be some of the best you have ever had. The crab salad, basically a deconstructed salad was off the charts.  
Save room and pace yourself, it is a lot of food.
