9ET_RUNztevq4_OLAX80Gg My husband and I went for Winterlicious, and over the years, we've come to have low expectations for the food and service during Winterlicious. However, the service was excellent. Great ambiance, prefect for a date night.

I asked for a gluten and dairy free meal and they were willing to accommodate me, which many Winterlicious restaurants don't. The lamb was delicious. They tried to substitute the yogurt sauce for a red pepper sauce, and sadly I'm also allergic to peppers, but they were so kind in getting out a new dish quickly. The manager also came over to check on the food and the new dish. As someone with food intolerance, I give big pluses to restaurants who are not only willing to accommodate us, but do it without makinh you feel bad or like you're causing lots of trouble. They were excellent with that.

The charcuterie plate and sorbet dessert were average. We would return to try their regular menu rather than being limited to the Winterlicious menu. 

Two people with the Winterlicious menu and two drinks came to about $130 after tax, before tip.
