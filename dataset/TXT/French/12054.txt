4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw My boyfriend and I love coming here on our special occasion nights. We love the service and the food, the food especially!

Our most favorite starting appetizer is definitely the scallops. I'm really picky on my scallops and Mon Ami Gabi gets it just right. If I would order about five plates of scallops for appetizer, main course and dessert I really would! It comes in three cute little seashell molds and each one has two perfectly plump scallops hiding under a nice layer of cheese (I normally remove to save myself the added calories) and after a nice sprinkling of lemon juice, dive in! It came to the point we have to get our own portions because it's so good. Definitely a must try.

I've had the bass (which was a special menu item, I believe) and the salmon (a regular menu item), and of the two the salmon is delicious! It's flaky and moist and it's just the right portion. 

The apple tarte...   What more can I say about this warm and cold and sweet luscious dessert. Well, we devoured it. Plain and simple. It was a nice ending to our meal. 

The only thing that kinda bothers me, is the seating. We were seated in the midst of groups and groups of people the last time we were here. On Valentine's day, however, we had a nice intimate two seat table away from every one else. That was nice. I would love it if we could get that kind of seating all the time, but availability gets in the way unfortunately.

Other than that, I highly recommend coming here if you like French food, or just food in general. Much, much better than the Eiffel Tower Restaurant-- by a lot!

On a side note, they also serve breakfast; which I am DYING to try!
