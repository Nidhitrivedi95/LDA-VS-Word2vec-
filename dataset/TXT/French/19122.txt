arImz3BJNf-EcNUuguk2Rw Ok so this place was right up the street from our hotel, so we went a couple time :s lol They make a MEAN burger, like this bad boy is large and just rude hahah the first time we went they were super busy and the girl never asked me if i wanted everything on it, so i got all the fixings including thsoe i didnt like.... Theres somethigna bout montreal and everything coming with coleslaw...its strange. The one complaint is that there coleslaw sucks (and i think its saurkraut but they said slaw..) I pulled it right off my burger, but they thing is juicy and made to order! frikken delish. The poutine isnt half bad either, the gravy could use some work lol. The have alot of shit on the menu but the best is the burger. Second time around it wasnt busy and the guy let us eat before we paid which was nice. They have a good dine in and patio area going on which is nice. Im for sure down for a brochette burger anytime!
