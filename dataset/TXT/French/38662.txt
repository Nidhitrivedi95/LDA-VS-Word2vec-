jLxeBgWhLRbII2ACkgH1Sg I've been to french bakeries all around town and this is by far the best one... it's authentic from the pastries to the employees. I enjoyed the Florentine quiche and cafe au lait and it exceeded my expectations! Everything is fresh. The owner, David, is a wonderful man and makes you feel welcomed, he cares about his customers. He brought my friend and I, creme brûlée and it was exquisite. It's actually one of my favorite desserts too( which he had no idea about!) Places like La Belle Terre are hard to find in a city like ours... most business owners don't actually care about their customers but this place is different and the owner is too. It was such a genuine experience my friend and I had- we sat there for hours enjoying ourselves. Thank you La Belle Terre!
