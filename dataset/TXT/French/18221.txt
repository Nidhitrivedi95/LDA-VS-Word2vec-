A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g Mmm cake! I've been here a few times already and it's the best place to indulge in with cakes. I've tried a few of their cake slices and omggg. Heaven. First off, their cake slices are hugeee. It probably takes me a few days just to finish a slice. All the slices I've tried aren't too sweet. It has just the right amount of sweetness in the cakes for my taste. The cake is moist in every bite, with their fresh whipped cream covering the sides. I can't remember which ones I've tried but I loved each and every one of them.

They also have a cafe part that sells sandwiches and things. I have never tried the cafe. Just the bakery part. They do sell whole cakes as well as slices. Oh and can't forget the macaroons! 

Word of advice though..come early. The earlier you come in, the more choices of cake slices you can choose from. I came once in the mid afternoon once and there was only like 3-4 different types of cake slices to choose from.

It is a must try for any desert lover!
