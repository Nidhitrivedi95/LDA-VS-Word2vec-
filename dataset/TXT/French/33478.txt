hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA My son has been talking about this place forever and how good it is.. I live on the east side of town..We came finally on Monday for his birthday pick for breakfast.. 
It was so hard to choose what to eat.. The menu and the fresh pastries .. What to choose.. 
I had to have the freshly made Quiche with bacon & ham.. It was so light, creamy the curst perfect.. and fresh served with a small salad on the side.. 
Wow.. The coffee served in a huge coffee cup.. Will be back.. Their are not enough stars to give this place.. I give you 10 out of 10 perfection..
