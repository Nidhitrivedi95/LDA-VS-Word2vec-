rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I've had the chicken and the steak & frites here, and both were perfectly executed. If I had to choose, I'd go with the steak again. Or maybe the chicken. Or both!!

it struck me as odd that the fries were so good, I was expecting them to just be fries. But they were something else. However, despite all the raving reviews, the butter just tasted like butter to me. 

Service is amazing. They were about 10 minutes late in seating us from our reservation time, so they ended up comping us two desserts. Now that's going above and beyond. Highly recommend this place.
