HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw Great customer service, very cute decor, good french tunes. VERY delicious food! A welcome break from the burger/fries/sandwich menu at most Vegas places. The beet salad is extraordinary. The salmon was sooooo fabulous. Even the bread with exotic pink salted butter was delish And the waiter was very knowledgeable about the cuisine and helpful in general. Also has a great view of the strip.
