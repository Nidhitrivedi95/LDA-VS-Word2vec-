DJcvnN7BCiqOUAra35xYuA I was craving vietnamese but didn't have high expectations when I visited this place. I was pleasantly surprised! While they didn't have my go-to meal (bun), the pho with steak was delicious and the spring roll options were plentiful. AND can't beat the happy hour beer prices. I'd come back for sure.
