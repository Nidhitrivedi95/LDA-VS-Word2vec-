The view of the fountains is incredible when you are seated on the patio and even in June, the heat was pleasant. Attire can be dressy or business casual. Dessert was to die for, they even brought us chocolate treats as an extra. While we were walking out, they gave us boxes of muffins to enjoy for breakfast. We will be back for sure!
