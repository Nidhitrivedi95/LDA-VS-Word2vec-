4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I am extremely impressed by this establishment because not only was it affordable for French food but it was really good too. Me and a few friends decided to come here after checking out the reviews on yelp and were not disappointed! 

I had the Bordelaise and had a chance to try the Bearnaise from my boyfriend as well. Both steaks were made so perfectly but let me tell you something. If you're coming here you need to get the Bearnaise. I PROMISE you that you won't be disappointed. I was extremely jealous because my boyfriend's plate was so good. I enjoyed mine as well and I will never eat steak the same way ever again. Hopefully, I can come back here when I go to Vegas again one day!
