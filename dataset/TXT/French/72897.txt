XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q Whatever positive things can possibly be said about Joel Robuchon have been said! We made reservations right after booking the Vegas vacay. After searching for the fanciest restaurant in the city and reading many reviews this was the result! We had the 16 course Degustation. Yes very very expensive but an experience worth having and repeating. :) We didn't do the limo to the restaurant thing because we were staying at the Signature on the MGM property. Instead they gave us a deal on tickets and champagne at the restaurant. :) 

I suggest making reservations after 7p or 8p. Our reservations were early because of the show that night and the atmosphere was more lively towards the second half of the really long dinner. The little courtyard outside (still actually indoors) looked cozy and intimate. When we sat down the hostess placed a tiny stool on my left for my purse LOL!
