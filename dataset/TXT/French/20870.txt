AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw I happened upon this wonderful little gem while in Las Vegas for a trade show.  The food delicious and wait staff excellent.  If you love French cuisine, breakfast foods, eggs then you need to try this restaurant.  I did almost cry when I tried the ham -- I've always loved ham but never knew it could taste so good -- a delicious explosion of taste the second it hit my mouth.  Yes -- I am only talking about ham and nothing more graphic -- get your mind out of the gutter.
