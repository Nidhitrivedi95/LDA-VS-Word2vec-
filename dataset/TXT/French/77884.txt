YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g How do you post pictures on a review?  Is it even possible?  For the time being I posted pictures of our dinner on my profile.  Take a look at it and your mouth will water.  

Ordered the Onion soup, slow cooked beef and basil ice cream.  Wife had the scallops and beef tar tar.  Look at my pics.  This was a very memorable meal.  The seared scallops...we've tried to recreate it at home, but haven't been so lucky without setting off our fire alarm.  If you pay alittle more you can get the wine room that is table for 2 upstairs.  Super romantic if you know what I mean.
