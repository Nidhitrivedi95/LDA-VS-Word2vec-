5EIuCcoHY2evAhFMBV6G6g I'm surprised by the reviews of this place, but I had a great dinner there with my family.  My brother described it as his best meal of his entire life.  If that tells you anything.  It is a french steak house, I didn't love the decor but the restaurant was great.

We started with escargot, which is normally one of my favorite, but it was not as good as I expected.  I would have liked it to have a bit more flavor.  The rest of the meal was incredible though.  We all shared the special seafood platter for two.  It had lobster, shrimp, oysters, clam, mussels, and crab legs.  On the side we got the mussels appetizer which was warm.  Let me tell you we could not eat enough of the seafood.  It was fabulous.  It was the perfect amount of food for three people.  

For dessert there were 2 chocolate souffles which I heard were fabulous. I had the strawberries oven baked in aged balsamic. I am not a chocolate person and I thought the strawberries were perfect.  I'm recommend it to anyone who likes a lighter dessert.  It was served with cheese on the side that was a very light blue.

I would recommend going there for dinner and trying out their seafood.
