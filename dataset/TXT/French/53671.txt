qmh6zxtJ8C8-YiUPv7ySlw I was extremely disappointed with this restaurant, not only with their food, but also with their service.  First of all, we waited for at least an hour before our food came out of the kitchen.  That was absolutely unacceptable for a restaurant as renowned as DB.  Secondly, their food was unbelievably mediocre.  I don't remember the name of the dish I ordered, but what I do remember is that it was a fish dish and the fish was dry, the broth/sauce was too salty, not to mention, the portion was ridiculously tiny.  

Even though I was not impressed with their food, I enjoyed their bread a lot, especially their fig bread.  

I expected more from this restaurant and this place had definitely failed to live up to its reputation.
