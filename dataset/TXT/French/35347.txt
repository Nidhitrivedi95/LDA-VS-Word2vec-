Ht-_i0UAq7YDBaqJwcQMdQ Anthony Bourdain was right! This place is amazing. I must say I was impressed with the food and the different flavors on one plate that happens to go perfectly together. Only problem with this restaurant is that the portions are miniature. What surprised me is that even though the portions were small somehow at the end of the dinner we were satisfied. We ordered the scallops ( 1 scallop per person)  and the tuna with sweetbreads for appetizer and for main course we shared the deer w gnocchi. We didn't order dessert but they surprised us with an ice cream and tart at the end! Love when this happens :)
