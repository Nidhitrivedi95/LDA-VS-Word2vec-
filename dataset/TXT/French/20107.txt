aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw I bought salted caramel and pistachio... It was so good! Better than some local bakeries I've tried. They were $3.50 a piece I think but it was fine because it's bigger than the usual. I'll definitely stop in again when I decide I need a stroll through the strip.

The location needs to be more out in the open ;)
