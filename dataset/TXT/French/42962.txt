LQ_gYNs5E10IGFE0NOyD7A Our first visit for lunch. Not great. Food was OK but nothing special and for sure not enough to bring you back for more. Sat at the bar once a couple of weeks ago around 5pm and there was a good dinner crowd so something must be working OK for them but skip it for lunch, there are lots of better choices within a couple of blocks.
