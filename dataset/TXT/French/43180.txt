lQ9VmIWvM6v-rONPkYX8aQ Ok yelpers, I have to say you let me down on this one!  My friend and I dined here after exhaustive research on "the best" dining in Vegas.  I even got gussied up and wore a tux.  At any rate.  Now I expected something stellar given the 2 michelin stars--usually a pretty good indicator of quality.  I have to say it was fair at best.  I'm pretty much a snot when it comes to fine dining, as my gustatory sensation was developed in NYC.  I've experienced Keller, Georges, Ripert, Daniel and THOSE chefs are the epitome of true fine dining.  So I have to say Alex did nowhere near the quality of the those guys.  Firstly, the service was a bit clumsy.  I saw the sommelier serving food, and the server pouring wine.  It was a bit disturbing in such a "fine dining establishment."  My friend and I had the tasting menu, but were thoroughly disappointed in the food and overwhelmingly disappointed in the wine paring.  Regarding the food, it was totally salty--not a big deal, but I NOTICED that it was salty, not that the food was bad, but I was nowhere near blown away--and for basically 150$ per course I should have been.  The wine pairing was just crap.  A bunch of California blends--nearly all whites, that smelled and tasted like sweat.  DO NOT get the wine pairing if you get the tasting menu.  In fact, save your 700 ducks and go somewhere else.  If you are JUST DYING to try Alex, my suggestion is to get the 3 course fixe prix and just choose a nice bottle of wine.  The exhorbant price tag does not justify the experience.  I have never regretted spending a large amount of money on fine dining until now.
