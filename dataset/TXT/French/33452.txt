hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA I was really looking forward to trying this place because of all of their amazing reviews especially the ones posted by the elite members. However, by all means avoid the lunch hour rush! I came in a few minutes before noon and luckily there was only 1 person ahead of me. But a minute after, practically every office employee within a 1 mile radius was here! Not only physically, but also calling in their orders for them to pick up (smart decision).

As I was waiting in line and looking over the menu. I noticed Olivier was holding his phone with his gloves on. And from what I saw he touched some food immediately after. 

The first thing I put in my mouth was greens from the side salad that came with the sandwich. Unfortunately the greens were wilted, which was already a turn off.  

I ordered the tuna panini which was a pretty standard panini. The only thing is it wasn't left on the panini press long enough because the lines from the grill were really faint. I think since they were in a rush to get the food in and out of the kitchin quick, it wasn't left on the press long enough. And I really do like that toasty taste. 

I was more pleased with my other selections such as the shrimp bisque and the banana nut muffin.

Shrimp Bisque- very tasty, I've ordered lobster bisque at a classy restaurant and this was just as good. The 2 pieces of toasted baguette was a really nice touch.

Banana nut muffin- really moist and I enjoy the fact there's no cinammon. 

I will probably be back, just to see if my next experience with be more enjoyable.
