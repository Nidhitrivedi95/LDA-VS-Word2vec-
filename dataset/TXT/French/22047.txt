BS0GcQ1kUag8YJ2qcBH2lQ Caren's is one of the Toronto treasures that gives me the utmost pleasure and happiness. I've had lunch and dinner there and I love almost every aspect of it! I don't visit when it's not summer, just because I'm so enchanted by the enclosed patio. All I ask in life is for intimate dates with my lover here, especially if we haven't seen each other in awhile and want to catch up.

The service is consistent and considerate and so far I've been lucky with the wine. I had the sausage pasta last time I visited and it was sooo yummmy! I wouldn't have made it better myself (who am I fooling, I couldn't make that!)...I really appreciated the tangy spices that complemented this dish..
Carens really is a delight..
