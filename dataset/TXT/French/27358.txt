dDKhRQlw_OVsPLQAGAeNyA Had a very nice meal Sunday evening, the restaurant is very quaint. The server was blasé.  
The black board specials were not explained very well, it may have been a language barrier or compete indifference on her part but she failed to help us understand the preparations when asked. She droned in expressionless monotone "there is lamb, a salad with ham and the lobster'.  Then complete silence pad and pen at ready.

So, we ordered off the regular menu:The seafood de mer, duck confit, and cod were all delicious.
If I am in Montreal again I would go back.  The setting and food were good.  Waitress perhaps a a bit tired or stressed out.
