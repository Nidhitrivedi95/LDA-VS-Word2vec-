XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q Ahhhh-mazing this place is! Or, well...that's an understatement...Robuchon is beyond amazing from taste, to presentation, to staff, to atmosphere, etc. etc. This place deserves more than 5 stars on yelp for sure.

Be prepared for an awesome experience while you dine here as you spoil your tastebuds for approximately three hours. Also, make sure you come hungry and be aware that money shouldn't be an issue when you dine here as you will definitely rack up a bill!

It is quite difficult to say what my favorite part of the meal was. Everything was superb and extraordinary. The selection of breads, cheeses and candied desserts were mindblowing! I wanted to try them all...

My friend and I enjoyed our meal in their psedo-garden which was quite nice and didn't come off cheesy looking. There, I loved the black cod dish that I ordered--you can taste the layers of flavor in this dish. My friend went with the lobster and veal dish. They were also so very good.

The things that I didn't really care to spend money on or would care less if they served this to me was the soup and the dessert. I also wasn't a big fan of their creme brulee as it tasted somewhat bland and the consistency was not to my liking. 

Oh and I liked the fact that my friend and I weren't treated like we didn't have the money to spend, since we were probably the youngest ones in the restaurant during our time there. 

Lastly, I want to say I came in very excited and full of energy and left feeling so tired and exhausted from such a lovely treat. And how nice of them to provide a nice chocolate treat along with a visual booklet of the restaurant at the end of the meal. I can't wait 'til I come in again!
