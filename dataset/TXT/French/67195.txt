USleI8g1UVN9-9jm-b4uIg Fig Tree is set up in beautiful home setting and we got place near fire place on request. I read about all great reviews online and reserved special time for our second anniversary. It was working day and we both got late for our reservation so we called to check if they can postpone our reservation.Staff was very friendly and they said just be here when you can! They set the mood right :) And from the moment we went there experience was wonderful. Every bite was so tasteful and unqiue flavours made our day even more special and amazing and they decorated our dessert with beautiful anniversary wishes. Would love to go back! Thanks eveyrone at Fig Tree for great time!
