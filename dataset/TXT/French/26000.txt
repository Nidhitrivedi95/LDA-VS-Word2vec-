d482l58ho0_IMdFkXX1F5Q DB Brasserie is owned by Daniel Boulud one of the top French chefs in the world. That reputation is proven by this restaurant. 

The restaurant serves traditional French dishes such as French Onion Soup with great flavor and stringy cheese, Charcuterie with two pates, salami, prosciutto, and pickled veggies with toasted bread for starters. 

For entres we had a 12 oz NY Strip Steak with fries and the night's special which was Quail stuffed with ground pork and foie gras, wrapped in chicken with a reduced wine sauce and some veggies. The teak was cooked to perfection and the quail was decadent. I mean it was just one delicious bite after another. 

An amazing restaurant that we look forward to go to in the future.
