4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Holy cow this place has the most tender, the juiciest and most perfectly cooked stake ever! Even their mashed potatoes rule! We came in with a gigantic group of 16 and although we were seated at 2 separate tables, it still worked out fine. Our waitress was super nice and cheerful. We started off with some fresh baked French bread with butter and weird but delicious shredded carrots. Then the entree follows. They serve flat water in cute bottles and even their flat water tasted like Dasani haha. I loved this place and will definitely be back!
