Bh8qt5P8MmhEEu_qRLz7EQ We arrived in Montreal and settled into our motel before heading out in the COLD rain to find a place to eat. We were actually looking for a recommended restaurant and happened upon this jewel so we ducked in to get out of the rain. The service was slow but steady. We were never ignored but it wasn't as speedy and we like. We had a good wine (beer for him) and ordered a salad and a cheese plate. The restaurant is cozy and full of nooks and crannies, and interesting seating configurations. We were seated next to a window and enjoyed watching people scurrying about with their mackinacks and umbrellas in the downpour. Because the US dollar was so strong, when our credit card statement came in we were delighted to see that the conversion rate was quite favorable. 
The menu was in French but we were also given an English version which was fun...I practiced my high school French comprehension and then had my husband check my translation...and I was correct more than I was wrong!
All in all, it was a nice, relaxing time spent here, unwinding after the travails of customs, buying transportation vouchers, finding our way to our hotel, unpacking, and then heading out in a totally new city to try to find sustenance. If we ever return to Montreal, we'll definitely return to Cafe du Nouveau Monde!
