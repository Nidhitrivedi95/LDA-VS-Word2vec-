This sign often graces the front of Henri's and folks, it's true: there's a big, friendly cafe in there! In fact, if it's your first time in the door, it will surprise you how much stuff sits behind their simple exterior.

There's a little coffee bar surrounded by ample seating. They brew great coffee and it's a quiet place to work.

There's a deli counter with super nice folks who will talk your ear off about cheese. 

There's cheese!

There are shelves of fresh baked bread tucked next to a cooler with great local goodies.

There's often fresh garlic hanging near the window.

But most importantly, when you combine all those together and then pop yourself at one of the best people watching front windows in Stockbridge, you my friends have the perfect lunch/coffee combo afternoon.
