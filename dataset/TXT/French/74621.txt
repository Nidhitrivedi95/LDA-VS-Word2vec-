xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g Gents....be careful when you decide to take a girl out without making plans.  My date made zero plans and said he would take me to dinner wherever I wanted to go...so guess what? I wanted to go to the super fancy Eiffel Tower Restaurant.  Make reservations ahead of time....we got in on a Friday night because of the connections I have.  :)  Anyways, Grilled Lamb with huckleberry's and chestnuts? Yes please!!!!  Chocolate desserts and Chocolate souffles???? HELL YEAH! To die for!!! Dont forget to refinance your house before coming here...you will need the cash.  Oh and ever since this incident, my guy has had a plan for every date we go on. ;-)
