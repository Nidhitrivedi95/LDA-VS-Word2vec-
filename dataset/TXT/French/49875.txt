oS96aJIHFWcFAlGHKKXjaw My first visit to La Gourmandine came after a particularly stressful exam, so after I traipsed down to Butler and opened the door, my blood pressure must have dropped by 10 with just the sweet smell of butter and caramelized sugar that invited me even closer toward the display case. I ended up buying an almond croissant as well as a butter and prosciutto (!) sandwich on a crusty baguette, both to take home... or so I thought. As I was waiting for the bus home, I couldn't help myself, so I decided to take just *one* bite of my pastry... and next thing I knew, I had sticky fingers and sugar all over my shirt. Pure bliss. The sandwich didn't disappoint, either. I also enjoyed that the woman who was helping me took the time to explain the different pastries and help me choose, given that this was my first visit. I was very impressed overall, and hope to be back again soon to try another delectable dessert.
