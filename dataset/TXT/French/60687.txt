SCklYa_jhihWAcfIn-_chg Excellent breakfast spot - but get there early (like, at 8am) before the line-up gets too long. The small space fills up not only with people, but with hunger-inducing aromas of baked goods - I think I gained 3 pounds just from these sweet scents alone! Coffee is bottomless and I was never without a full steaming mug, thanks to the attentive staff. I had the Croque Madam - ham and gruyere on brioche topped with a fried egg. It was balanced well by the light side salad. Though I thought I wouldn't be able to finish the baguette on the side, but it tasted so much like my grandmother's baked bread from the village, in the end, I wanted more. Got chocolate croissants to go for a mid-morning snack later on. I love this place and would go back in an instant.
