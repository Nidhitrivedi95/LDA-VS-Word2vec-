dd3GZs6zW2t7BM0cbxAzvg Me and my friends came here for New Years pre-fixe brunch. I'm glad that there's a place that is open on actual New Years. 

The food was good. Wasn't mind blowing, but I did enjoy the food. 

For appetizer I had the Paté de campagne. I'm not a paté connoisseur but it tasted like it should.  
For main I had the Steak Haché, which is really just a steak burger. It was very big and filling, and tasted good. 
For dessert I had the Green Tea Crême Brulée which was bit small, but just the right size after being super full from the burger. 

The servers were good. The atmosphere was lovely and I enjoyed that they played French music. The decor was very exquisite. The only thing was that it was bit pricey, but that's expected if you go to a nice French place. 

All in all, recommend it and would come here again.
