4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I'm not a huge fan of French food, but Mon Ami Gabi was a pleasant surprise. Maybe it's because I was starving from dancing all day at Encore Beach Club, or maybe it's because I was too broke to spend much else on food all weekend. Either way, Mon Ami Gabi hit the spot at 4 pm on a Saturday in Vegas.

I got the onion soup and the baked cheese. The onion soup was a little bland but tasty, especially with all of that melted cheese. The baked cheese was delicious -- the garlic pesto (?) bread it came with was sooooo good, and it was really hearty and filling dipped in the cheese and marinara sauce. I also tried some of my friends' food, which was all great. I think my favourite of everything I tasted was my friend's steak au poivre -- hardly surprising. The steak had so much flavour, and the frites were perfectly fried.

Service was pretty awful, unfortunately. Luckily we weren't in a rush; otherwise the two hours it took for us to get in and get out with a reservation would've been a huge issue.
