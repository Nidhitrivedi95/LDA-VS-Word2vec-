sARavfidmIS878q5BtlyVQ We can be quite uncouth at certain times depending on who's in the group, but the crew who prepared our meal were more than prepared to keep us laughing and entertained while putting out some amazing food. There were some times that weren't necessarily on my palate preferences, but the artistry and the technical execution of the dishes were impressive all the same. 

The service provided for this meal was on the upper tier of what we'd expect for fine dining. and I appreciate the small details that were considered for this dining experience.
