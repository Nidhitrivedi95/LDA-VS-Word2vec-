aaWhSHpsE285eaSTzDxAMA I was there for lunch and loved this place.  It had a neighborhood feel and the food was great.  It's small so I can imagine that it may be hard to get get a table on Saturday night.

I had a taco salad that was so flavorful and seasoned traditionally but different.  Hard to explain.  My companion had a salad as well.  I thought the prices were extremely reasonable for the quality.
