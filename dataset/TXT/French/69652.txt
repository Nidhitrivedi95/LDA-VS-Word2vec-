I went there once but I wouldn't recommend it for a visitor!! 
There's so many great restaurants in Montreal needed to be discovered 
I liked the place the decorations , l could not finish my plate cause the size of the meal are really large!! And the good thing though is that you can order half of the size !! also the service is good and fast.
