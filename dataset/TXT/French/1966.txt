We ordered randomly from the menu the Norwegian croissant and casserole and were completely surprised. The eggs were perfectly herbed and seasoned, the fruits were brightly fresh, the toast and croissants were buttery, and the salmon was flavorful. Along with the artful presentation and fantastic service, this little cafe was a hidden gem.
