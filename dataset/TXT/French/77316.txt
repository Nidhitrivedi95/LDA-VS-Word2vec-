YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g Decor: Dark. Sexy. Sophisticated. Tucked away in a corner of the Mandalay Bay, Fleur de Lys is one seductive scene. The service was impeccable, the staff warm and professional.

Best bread: Rosemary focaccia (kinda odd that it all comes out so cold though, one would hope/expect it to be warm at a place like this).

Prix Fixe Menu Advice: Pick the truffled onion soup over the ahi tartare, the braised veal & yukon gold potato ravioli over the chorizo wrapped suzuki sea bass and the guinness braised beef short ribs over the prime filet mignon. Both desserts kinda sucked for us, we weren't impressed with either the chocolate plate or the carrot and cream cheese ice cream sandwich.

3 words that sum up the entire experience: Truffled. Onion. Soup. I could drink this by the freaking GALLON. So smooth, so creamy, so flavorful... the most orgasmic soup EVER. EVERRRRRRRRRRRRRR.

Total for 2: $89x2 + $8 for coffee and $8 for tea (pass on the tea) - $50 restaurant.com coupon + tip = a 27th birthday-worthy meal for under $200.

Worth it? Yes.

Would I come back? Only for the truffled onion soup. And maybe the braised veal & yukon gold potato ravioli.
