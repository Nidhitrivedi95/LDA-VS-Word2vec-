9ET_RUNztevq4_OLAX80Gg My wife and I have been here a few times. Very cool place inside the Four Seasons Hotel and Residences. Nice ambiance and comfortable place to enjoy breakfast with someone special. The service is very good and attentive and the menu choices are very well done. My wife had the lemon-ricotta pancakes and I had the omelette. All very flavourful and served with nice presentation. Definitely a good place to take someone you want to impress.
