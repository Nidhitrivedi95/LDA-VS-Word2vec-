1cGyzWtfOoDiE8V0OR85yA The salad with the champagne dressing was very good and light.  I ordered the salmon crepes with spinach and was very nice with the creme fraiche.  Other items ordered was the spinach and cheese (tasted more like quiche), ham and cheese (what could go wrong?), and the dark chocolate crepe (62% cocoa).  They didn't give enough whip cream and walnuts on the sweet crepe but did satisfy the sweet tooth in the end.  Good enough!
