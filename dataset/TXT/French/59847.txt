SapSZ8x9OQa2iirx-gh6yQ The food here is pretty good.  I've had a few different meals here and I've really enjoyed them. I had fish, sweet breads, and my most recent was rabbit. All have been delicious!

What I actually love this place is the lemon (or lime) palette cleanser after the appetizer course. If you like french cuisine, I would recommend this restaurant, especially if you live in the West Island. Although it's a little expensive and the wines are over-priced (what else is new), its still a good bet. I would say the wine list is a little on the low end of overpriced wine, and their selection is pretty good.
