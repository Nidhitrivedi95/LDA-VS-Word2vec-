SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA Here for an anniversary dinner - we used to dine here 30 years ago when it was called That Place on Bellflower.  It's still a really quaint place, though the menu has changed a lot.  What knocked us out was the service - very very attentive, they were constantly coming by with more bread, water, refilling wine glasses, and good timing on getting the meal to us.  For food, I would give it a 4.5 out of 5, very good, but a touch short of fantastic.  The Escargot were wonderful, the garlic butter sauce is to die for - just to dip your bread in.  The house special salad, with beets, pistachios, greens and a light vinaigrette was very tasty and unique.  I had the daily (Friday) special, walleye with lobster sauce, green beans, and dumplings.  Very delicate, small pieces of fish, but enough to satisfy, and tasty, so no complaint.  My wife had the duck confit with sweet potato puree and sweet cabbage - duck seemed pretty ordinary, though the other stuff was really good.  They had a French Sancerre wine, don't see that too often in restaurants, it's a nice dry white wine, we got it because we had it in France a couple years ago, and it was great.  Overall a wonderful meal.
