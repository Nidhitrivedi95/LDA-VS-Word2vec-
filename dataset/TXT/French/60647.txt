SCklYa_jhihWAcfIn-_chg Came her for brunch today and only had to wait 15 minutes for our party of 3 to be seated (for a Sunday morning around 11am, that was amazing!). We got a cozy corner on their patio. The smell of fresh bread is apparent and this place had amazing baked good! Their croissants (plain and almond) and baguettes are fresh, flaky and full of flavor. They also had tarts and cakes that looked amazing as well. Their service, yes it's a bit slow but sitting on an outdoor patio made time fly. Their coffee could have been a bit stronger being a French restaurant and all but their prices were reasonable ($54 for 3 people which included coffee, entrees and 2 croissants). I ordered their savory french toast - a bit too savory for my liking. The peppers and bacon were incorporated in the bread when I thought it would be on the side. I would recommend ordering the eggs benedict instead. It came on a croissant with greens. Please also note that they only accept cash but they have an ATM downstairs.
