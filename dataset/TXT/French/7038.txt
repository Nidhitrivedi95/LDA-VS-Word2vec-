4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I met some colleagues here the first night of a conference ... we were a group that grew larger than planned, and the service was just impeccable. Seamless, never skipped a beat. The waiter who served us was spot-on awesome. Split the check fourteen ways? Not a problem. 

There was sidewalk dining available but I'm not sure I could imagine doing this (at least not last week when the temperatures exceeded 110 degrees) but maybe in the winter ... 

Also, a great menu ... I would like to return to enjoy other meals here (I had dinner, and this feels like it would be a good place for any time of day).
