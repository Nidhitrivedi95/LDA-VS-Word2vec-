S5gtq6g6dIfyaFvyPYyzkg ok it was saturday lunchtime, and ok it had just started raining, i am sure this place is always fairly busy but that should never mean scrimping on customer service or decent manners should it? we arrived and took a seat in the main room (beautifully decorated and with the huge dome ceiling,plenty of natural light) the first of our servers came over looking perplexed to say the least, and asked who had seated us, as there had been no-one to greet us we had just sat down at the nearest free table, this was WRONG apparently and off she stomped to tell on us! the second server came across as a snobby showman type, flourishing the menus and placing our napkins for us (too much in any restaurant!) we ordered drinks and sat back, our second mistake of the visit, the table we had sat at was for diners only, if we wanted only drinks we should have sat at the bar, this information was imparted with a sneer from the snobby showman, he obviously took great delight in maintaining a frosty rather than friendly atmosphere amongst his clientle, at which point i had had enough and we left. I would normally have complained in that situation, we would have stuck to their 'rules' if we'd have known or been told about them,even a sign that said 'wait here to be seated' would have saved the day, but the rudeness of the staff has ensured that visit was a one off.
