jalA5zHW8ZfY3RSPG7oDxQ I am so in love with this place. After reading the Yelp reviews I decided we had to go. We called on a Saturday afternoon to make a reservation and thank god we did. We wanted to get there at 6 but had to settle for 5:30; apparently they were totally booked for the night by the time we arrived (they were turning away walk-ins they had so many reservations). So glad we made a reservation, we never do.

Anyway. We brought a few beers/cider since its' BYOB and it was no problem (there's a $2 stem fee for each person). We ordered the spinach dip and LET ME TELL YOU it was absolutely divine. I could have bathed in it. The bread was fresh and warm, and the dip was absolutely to die for. Get it. You will. Not. Be. Sorry. Have I gotten that point across well enough yet?

For my entree, I had the NY Strip Steak. Also definitely not a mistake ordering this baby. It was tender, juicy, tasty, and delightful. The butter on top was good, the veggies it came with were good... Absolutely yummy. The BF had the pork chop and wasn't totally wow-ed with it like I was my steak, but as he said, it's hard to do a pork chop well. I wouldn't know, since I can barely cook Velveeta shells and cheese, but what are you gonna do? The crispy kale was really interesting, anyway. Not something you get every day.

This place was intimate, the food is cooked pretty much right in your face (it seems like an old deli counter turned open air kitchen), and they have a delightful little patio I'd love to sit on in better summer weather. Our waiter was attentive and friendly and I will so be back to Cafe du Jour.
