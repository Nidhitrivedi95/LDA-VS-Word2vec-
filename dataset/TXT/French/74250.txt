 -Food was good, not mind blowing, but still delicious. I recommend the lamb, the salmon, and creme brulee. The lamb was cooked to perfection, really juicy.
The salmon was delicious (I wish the portion were larger ^_^).
The creme brulee finished off the meal with a sweet kick.
-Gorgeous panoramic views of the strip (beautiful fountain view), request a window table if any are available
-Friendly, professional service


Cons:-One of the busiest restaurants on the strip, restaurant feels very crowded
-food and drinks are a bit over priced (but then again it is a restaurant on the strip)
-portions are small, but it is intended to be a multi course dinner
-can be a bit loud
-the booths still have a beautiful view of the strip, but the coveted tables are right on the window
-the woman checking us in was a bit stuck up, I had to greet her first =(

Overall, it was a good experience. But as far as I am concerned, this was a one time deal.
