dW9cPsvOGwlOpiz3wEBgiQ Bernard's Bistro is a quaint little restaurant located next to the ice skating rink. The staff is small but friendly, and you can actually see Chef Bernard himself cooking in the kitchen. The menu, inspired by French and California cuisine, is a diverse mix of reasonably priced dishes from savory crepes, sandwiches and salads (ranging from $10 to $15) to more expensive fare like filet mignon medallions and Chicken Mille Feuille. 

Upon the recommendation of the server, I ordered a Grilled Chicken sandwich, which came with a side salad. The presentation of the dish was lovely, and I was surprised by the large portion size. There wasn't just one sandwich, there were four open-faced sandwiches (made from slices of crusty baguette) each smeared with pesto and topped with a generous piece of freshly grilled chicken breast, a sweet mustard sauce, a slice of juicy tomato (lightly roasted for concentrated tomato flavor), a slice of avocado, and a drizzle of balsamic reduction. On the plate was also a small salad dressed in the same balsamic reduction sauce, and slices of cucumber and turnip. I enjoyed every element of the dish. 

I also tried the tuna sandwich.  What I liked about this sandwich was the lightness of it as the tuna wasn't drenched in mayonnaise. Though I thought this sandwich was good, I definitely enjoyed my sandwich more. The only problem about these open-faced sandwiches is the difficulty involved in eating them. The tuna sandwich was easier to eat as I just picked it up and ate it with my hands, but I used my fork and knife to eat my grilled chicken sandwich. But this doesn't detract from the tastiness of the food. 

Service is friendly and knowledgeable, and the ambiance of the restaurant is cozy, perfect for a date night. If you happen to be in Lake Las Vegas, I suggest trying Bernard's Bistro. Not only will you have a nice dining experience, but you'll be supporting a local business as well.
