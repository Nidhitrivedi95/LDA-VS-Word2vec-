el-3IdlW3bTCSnquLvH-3w Love this quaint little bistro!  We were so glad to see it was still around!  We visit Scottsdale a couple times of year and discovered this gem a year ago. Tonight was our 3rd visit and it was fantastic as always. It is romantic and perfect for a quiet dinner and sipping wine. Everything is great but the dessert crepes are outstanding!  They need more business though. Go check them out!
