UxWH8zRYIBgs6Q2oykvRdw Went there for Summerlicious and the hostess was pretty rude and unpleasant to deal with, the waiter wasn't that attentive, and the food was ok. The appetizers were atrocious, the main was okay, and the dessert whatever. Seriously overpriced and it was quite warm in the restaurant as well. Would never go back. What a waste of money and time.
