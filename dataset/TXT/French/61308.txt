SJo_IjvzdRtCvZVN0cbrRQ Fantastic place for a delicious brunch! We came on a Sunday morning - although the wait looked long, a table came quickly for our party of two. The building is unassuming, but the food was delicious. My friend ordered the chicken and waffles - so good. I had a crepe with goat cheese inside and sausage and mushrooms on top - perfect and savory. Highly recommend!
