4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I love this place!  I've only eaten here during the day, but I love love love the outdoor patio across from the Bellagio fountains!  This is a great place to take ladies who've never been to Vegas before.  
The food is excellent (For brunch, I had the eggs benedict and some delicious coffee), and the service was efficient and friendly.  
There might be a bit of a wait to get a seat on the patio, but it's worth it.  Totally recommend.
