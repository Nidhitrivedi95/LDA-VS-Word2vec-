gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg I just finished the "pulled" pork sandwich. It was shredded pork mixed up with some sub-standard BBQ sauce. The food so far has been nothing remarkable. I attempted to order a pitcher of beer, but I was told no, as she assumed I meant of water. She left before I could say "of blonde".  The server doesn't speak any English and probably did not attend any post primary education. She will not be receiving a tip from me, and I usually tip a generous 20%. Every aspect of this establishment is of two star value, as.d 2 stars it shall get. The beer, the very namesame of the chain, is a surprising two and a half star. Hopefully this shared pitcher will be enough to help me expel the food I so sorrowfully payed for.
