JezHN-9KKLTMbojq00VP0g I have eaten at Le Petit over a dozen times and used to enjoy it immensely. My last experience was not so good. The ham and cheese croissant, which used to have a delightfully melty slab of Brie, now had only a Brie tease, smaller than a sad saltine cracker. My other problem was the croque Monsieur was covered in ice cold bechamel.  When we asked the staff to fix it, they just microwaved the whole plate. I was so sad to take family to a restaurant I've always loved for its high quality go the way of so many other restaurants that get lazy. I will give Le Petit one more try because I have had so many good experiences, but I was unhappy with my last experience there.
