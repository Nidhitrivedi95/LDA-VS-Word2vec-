2g7BfzamlNGPP6jMZrt8kw This year, we picked Montreal to have our family reunion and Thanksgiving celebration.  I flew  from Vancouver, my sister drove from Maryland, and my brother from Toronto. Our friends, celebrating their 30th wedding anniversary from Chicago also came.  On our first evening night (October 6), we booked Bistro L'Aromate for a party of 8 to have our dinner since it is closer from where we were staying at  Hotel Sofitel. The food was okay, though the presentations were quite impressive, but the waitress was very rude and rough. If ever you want to eat there, never pick that speckled girl with dark brunette hair to serve. She is horrible. I would never never go back to this restaurant because of her.
