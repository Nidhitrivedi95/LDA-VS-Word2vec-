AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw Oh my...I am in LOVE.

After strolling around Caesar's Palace, including the Forum Shops (which you should visit too by the way), my honey and I decided to go check out Payard for a little snack.  Honey bunches bought me a dozen assorted French Macarons.  $28 (yes, for 12 macarons), but TOTALLY worth it!  The flavors that were included were: Coffee, Chocolate, Vanilla Bean, Lemon, Blackberry, and Raspberry.

Now, let me tell you, I am no macaron expert, but these French macarons??  D-I-V-I-N-E.  Each one was so FRESH, flavorful, moist, light, and fluffy!  I even took them back home on an airplane, and 4 days later they still tasted fresh - as if I had bought them that day!  Oh and they come in a cute little box that is sealed with a magnet.  How cute and clever!

My favorite flavor by far was the Vanilla Bean, followed by the Coffee and then the Chocolate.  You could see specks of vanilla bean in the cookie of the Vanilla Bean macaron.

When we visit Vegas next time, we will for sure be going back.  Can't wait to try their fresh pastries and desserts (which looked exquisite in the case by the way!).  They also have assorted chocolates, candy, sandwiches, crepes, and coffee.

So glad they have a website that you can order from!!  They also carry Parisian and Japanese macarons.  Those are next to try on my list.
