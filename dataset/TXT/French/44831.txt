mr4FiPaXTWlJ3qGzp4-7Yg The summary of 3 stars for Table 17 is that it's too expensive for it's location and quality.  It's still pretty good, I just don't like seeing a cheque for $60 for brunch.  

The good:
- The food is good and the ingredients are top quality
- Sundays and Mondays it's bring your own wine with no corkage fees
- Brunch has a 14oz Blanche de Chamblis with a splash of OJ for $4 which is the best value on this menu
- They do potato rosti right
- Sarah T orders TWO sides of bangers because she loves them so much... I really do like their bacon
- Good service both times I've been
- Proximity to my house
- they use opentable

The bad:
- It is too expensive.  The breakfasts don't come with sides, and sides each cost $4. So scrambled eggs with toast is $10, plus bacon is $14 plus hashbrowns is $18. I could maybe stomach $14.95 for a complete brunch, but I hate paying 10$ for eggs then having to add on the things I feel should come with it.  Maybe I'm not classy enough to eat bacon here.
- It's not as good as Le Select brunch, which I don't mind splurging $60 on once in awhile. I won't spend my $60 here instead of there. (both times I've been here Sarah T picked.)

No funny stories.

Would I go here again?  Maybe.  I might try it out for dinner one one of the BYOB nights.  Man, this place is just too expensive.  I know that's all I keep saying about it, but they charge too much for the food here.
