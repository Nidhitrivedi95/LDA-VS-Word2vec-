4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Mon ami Gabi was my first stop for food after landing in Vegas.  This place happened to be right next to my hotel which was very convenient. I came in both times for brunch and sat outdoors as that was my main purpose in dining here. The first time I came in, I ordered the eggs Benedict with a macchiato and a mimosa. While my friend had a cafe au lait and unfortunately, I forgot what she ate for breakfast.  

So the eggs Benedict wasn't anything special BUT they pretty much had the best English muffin I've ever tasted.  It was fluffy and thick unlike most English muffins that come with the Benedict which are thinner.  Their English muffin is made in house so that's why it's unique in my opinion. The mimosa was certainly strong, definitely getting my money's worth because it was not cheap. 
I stopped in again before checking out the hotel for breakfast and ordered the smoke salmon, I found delicious as well. I should've tried their lunch menu. Maybe next time.  

In order to get in the restaurant for eating outdoors, you have to go through the casino, which I think is kind of stupid.  The indoors is very dim, there's also a greenhouse kind of room if you rather see sunlight and have air conditioning.  The outdoor area include umbrellas.  It makes good spot for people watching and sometimes you'll see random street performers which is always interesting.
