vg55SAkrEmuHpWfIMtJjBQ Legume keeps being one of my top places to eat in the burgh!!
They have excellent food always! new dishes always!!
Great service always, it is nice to find places that keep it up for many years now.
I would recommend this place to anyone. It is not cheap not I think within the range of the kind of restaurant that they are.
Good choice all the time.!!!
