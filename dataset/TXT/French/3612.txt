1ThbwFVBL9YA2oOM11iO7g Not often do I get to go for lunch downtown, had to find a place with a 'lunch' menu. This place is nice for lunch, it's not too crowded but has people to not feel like I've taken over the place.

I had the lunch cubano, basically a cubana sandwich. As people say, it's ham and cheese but it's weird, it's a pretty good ham and cheese sandwich. The toast haad texture of croutons.

The Cuban dinner is pork, rice+beans, plantains. They don't skimp on the salt. But the plantains were delicious, pork though is a bit dry.

I'd say the service could be more attentive. Though it's ossington, usually it's laid back. But they usually show you they care. This place, just laid back.

I like the "art" that is on the wall, particular the alphabet signage. I was corrected (not at the restaurant, by someone who I was telling about it) that it's "typefaces" not "fonts" that is the art. People in this area must like their "typefaces".
