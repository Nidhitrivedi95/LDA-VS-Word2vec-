_T7f2wUgNlJqxsR-cR89SQ In my opinion, the best fine dining restaurant in Toronto. For this type of dining, prices are not crazy, and the food is amazing. They even have people come by to scrape crumbs off your table which at first is completely uncomfortable... but after you realize you're spending 100$+ a person it is easy to settle into a posh mindset and enjoy the fact that someone's whole job is to scrape crumbs off your table.

For vegetarians, this place does not sacrifice. I can not explain enough how frustrating it is that with so many fine dining establishments, they all do a risotto as their vegetarian dish... so sick of JUST having risotto as an option! Depending on what version of the menu they are serving during the year, their are a few really well thought out dishes. There is a veggie menu you can request at the restaurant that is not online by the way.

Last I went, I had a potato dish that was layered with goat cheese, and a mushroom/truffle pasta. Both were exceptional. Lots of good drinks and cocktails as well. To end it off, had to try the coconut cream pie, it was heaven and I can see why they sell it by the pie.

All in all amazing food and service. I have not been to the Pasta Bar, only the restaurant.
