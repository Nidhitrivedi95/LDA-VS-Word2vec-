xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g So I'm a 36-year-old bachelor and I've been to Vegas I don't know maybe A few dozen times. With that being said I have never been to the top of the replica Eiffel Tower. Needless to say it is worth every penny.
I highly recommend finding the Groupon purchase for two people and going up to the top during the Bellagio fountain showtimes.
