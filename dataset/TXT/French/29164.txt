eQ4Oj_kjrjVV0CfDcDWBmg Not the first place one would expect to see a French restaurant (in the middle of old china town), but a great place. 

We are vegetarians and were skeptical of finding good veggie French food --but the chef (Jean-Jacques) is very creative and accommodating when we called a day in advance and asked "What can we get if we are vegetarians"--he turned it around and asked --"what would you like to eat". First time such an open honest proposition, we left it to the chefs imagination.

We enjoyed our appetizers and main dish--though the chocolate mousse was frozen in the middle--and the server said "oh thats expected, its semi-frozen".

Wine list is extensive and the ambience is perfect for a no-attitude is right. 
This is a place I will be visiting again and insisting the mouse be completely non-frozen :)
