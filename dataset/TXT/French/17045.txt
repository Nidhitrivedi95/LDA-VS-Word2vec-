Appetizers were standard with any other restaurant at this price range. The meats on the charcuterie board were very basic and nonetheless unimpressing, while the tuna tartar seemed to be the better of the two it is still nothing special. The gigot d'agneau was the star of the dinner, with the meat falling right off the bones; cooked to perfection. Everything in the lamb dish just melded together and eggplant with the parsley salad brought perfect balance to the dish. 

I would say that their desserts are nothing too spectacular, but it wasn't bad either. The desserts just aren't worth the money though, I'd recommend dinner here with dessert somewhere else!

Service at Cafe Boulud was exceptional and even if the waiters/waitress don't give a shit about you, they seem to be very good at making you feel like they do ! :] We were well taken cared of and overall the dining experience there wasn't far off from the price.
