4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I've had this spot bookmarked for ages and finally got the chance to try it for breakfast on Bethany E's birthday! We came at opening to ensure patio seating, highly recommend as a wait can get long and the interior is dark and masculine- great for dinner, not so much for brunch.

We tried the Chicken, Apple, and Brie Crepes- great mix of flavors with the acidity from the apple, the salty creaminess of the cheese, and the savory of the meat, all wrapped in a lovely, thin crepe and served with a small side salad. We also tried a daily special, an Eggs Benedict dish with chicken and wilted spinach with chive Hollandaise, served with a side of frites. The eggs were perfectly cooked, the English muffin base wasn't too difficult to cut, and the frites were thin, crispy, and just a touch salty. Both dishes were about $15, large portion size good for sharing.

Service was great, though unfortunately I didn't catch our server's name. The patio is a beautiful spot for breakfast, great for people-watching, too. At 7AM in early July, it wasn't too hot but they do have umbrellas spaced out for shade.  Everything was so well-executed, I am hoping to return for dinner service (escargot and steak frite!) soon.

NOTE: You cannot reserve seating on the patio, it is first come first serve. Reservations (available through Open Table) only get you inside dining seating. I understand, but I'm not a fan. Maybe having a short 5-10 min grace period to hold patio table with reservation would be a better option.
