cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg This was one of the best restaurant experiences I have had in Montreal and if Yelp would let me, I'd give it 4.5 stars. 

The first good sign was the serving of warm bread. Given the name, I was expecting only pork options on the menu but the selection turned out to be quite varied. There were 11 of us so I got to try lots of entrees (and the portions are made for sharing): lobster, hen, happy pork chop, and bison rib. All were very good but the rib was the table favorite. It fell completely off the bone and was covered in a sauce that had a perfect blend of tang and sweet. The sauteed spinach garnish that came with the rib was delicious and would have loved it as a side. The mashed potatoes were also a hit...just like your grandmother made 'em.  (I was not as impressed with the special mussels appetizer, and the duck carpaccio needed some acid so minus half a star.)  Too stuffed for dessert.  

Topping it all off was the stellar service, and remember, we had 11 folks at the table. This place is a winner.
