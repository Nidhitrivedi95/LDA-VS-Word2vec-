aervNtqzrKf0CGrFo4xfKw I'm trying not to be very mean here.
me and 4 other of my friends went to this place on a Sunday for brunch on 11:40 a.m. the place was not so busy.maybe three or four other tables.They took our orders very late,about 12:10(imagine how hungry we could be for a Brunch). We waited forever to get our food ,so finally my friend complains and after taking them another 10 minutes to figure out what has happened the manager came and apologized,she said somehow the order was lost in the kitchen!!! 
I'm not saying that this is a supernatural thing,it can happen.I totally get that.but it was our waiter's responsibility to ask for our food.She sees that other people who have come later are getting their food and we are sitting there for an egg and cheese to get ready!! she could have asked the kitchen way earlier/
anyway,the manager took everything except the drink off our bills,which is why I'm giving them the two stars.
The food finally came around 1:00 p.m .I can't really complain about the food.it was well-dressed and tasteful but not something to remember.
