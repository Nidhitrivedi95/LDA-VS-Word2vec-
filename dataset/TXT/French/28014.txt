Our experience was very similar to Sean D's posted earlier. The service was by far the worst we have experienced in Montreal.

Same thing as Sean: wait staff avoiding eye contact lest they have to actually pay you any attention. After 45 minutes and not even a glass of water; and having asked two wait staff, and the barman (who told the manager) if we could be served we finally gave up. 

On the way out I asked to speak with the manager to let him know. I expected him to at the very least apologize but instead we were subjected to a barrage of vitriol. He pointed to other people and said they had been waiting 45 minutes or more too, and swung his arm in a gesture to indicate many more like them - like this was an excuse. I told him it is ok to wait but at least some acknowledgement and maybe a glass of water would be good. He made some excuse in an overly loud voice, like he had an audience, that he was running around. I suggested he hire more staff. More rudeness, so we gave up and left.

It was a shame because we had guests over from the USA, and while it was a tourist trap, we were tired after a day at the Old Port and figured it would work.

That sort of attitude should not be rewarded.

Never again. If I could give zero stars I would.
