Yp9w4nhUowBU_IS_StFXbQ I went for brunch at tableau this past Sunday morning. I called around 9:00am and was easily able to get a reservation for 11:30. The service was exceptional starting with the hostess I spoke to on the phone. We were promptly seated and our waiter was fantastic.

I had the brown butter pancakes and they were delicious! The real maple served warm was the icing on the (pan)cake! We sat poolside and it was fun to watch the various birds attack the pastry baskets lol. The decor and ambiance was elegant and was a perfect way to end our Vegas trip.
