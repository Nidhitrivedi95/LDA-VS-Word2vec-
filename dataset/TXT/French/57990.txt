rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A One word...Disappointed. Arrived early so we sat at the bar. The bartender stood 3feet away talking to female for approx 10-15 mins when he finally looked over at me and asked "Do you have a question?" I replied "Yes, is someone going to take our drink order?" Dinner service was horrible. Before I go there I must say a few dishes were stellar. Roasted bone marrow and French onion soup were great. I ordered the leek and potato soup. Flavorless, flat, needed salt. My husband said it tasted like mowed grass. It took quite sometime to get our entree. Two tables were seated after us and were finished with their meals before our entrees reached the table. The braised beef short ribs were ok, but this dish was over salted. My husband order the crispy duck, which was NOT crispy. He called it soggy duck, but did think it had good flavor. In Bouchon's defense they did give us free dessert due to the long wait. We have eaten at the Napa Valley location and truly enjoyed that experience, so needless to say we were extremely disappointed. Had better food for  less money in both San  Francisco and San Diego. Do love Thomas Keller's technique for roasting a whole chicken. Fool proof.
