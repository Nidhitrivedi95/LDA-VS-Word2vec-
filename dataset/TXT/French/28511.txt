ehRigNzlkRQlvhzKr7PLCQ I had a meatball spaghetti. The food was ok but the server seemed to be too busy to get me a table. There were two tables. I stood there for a while and I asked him if I can sit any table I want. He just pointed out somewhere I don't know. I don't want to leave a bad review but my experience was like that.
