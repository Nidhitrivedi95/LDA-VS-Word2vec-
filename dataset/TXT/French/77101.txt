yU3p0tEBtGuZLTcsBHw9uQ Checked out this restaurant while stay in Montreal for my birthday, since it was down the street for my airbnb. This place exceeded my expectations! We went later in the day, around 1:30 - 2 pm and the wait wasn't bad, we waited for about 5 minutes. The food was delicious everything they brought out looked so good. Definitely try the french toast. And to top if off, our waitress Melissa was the best! I would definitely come back when in Montreal!
