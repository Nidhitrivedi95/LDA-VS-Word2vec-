XKPosZx2j4RHcZ8Ewdwj0A After 10 pm, as others have alluded to here, there is a Late Night Menu, which my boyfriend and I sampled from last Friday night. The food (vegetable tian & escargot apps, cornish hen & steak tartare entrees) was good enough, although the escargots were a little overcooked...but the problem was that everything was rather uninspired in my opinion. Certainly I would never go to pay full price for these items. 
However, the most disappointing aspect of our dinner was the service. Our waitress (who was nice, it must be said) did not bring me the glass of wine I asked for, which I let go as I probably didn't need it anyway...but when we got the check (finally! it took a very long time to get it) we were charged for a whole bottle! When we noted it though, she was extremely apologetic and we did get our coffees comp'd. 
Still, the night was underwhelming flavor-wise and irritating service-wise. 
I suppose the ambiance was nice. If you want to try Lemeac, please be prudent and only go after 10 pm. There are tons of better restos in Montreal for you to spend beaucoup bucks on.
