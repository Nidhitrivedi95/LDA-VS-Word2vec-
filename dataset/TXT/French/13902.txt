50-xiTYmE6NERi-yJ6NvHw A 3.5 star experience. My husband and I arrived at 5:45 pm Tuesday night for an early dinner before a 7:30 Raptors game. I advised the hostess when I made the reservation that we needed to leave in 75 minutes. No joke- they advised all the 3 servers who attended our table. Our main server kept an eye on all the entrees to ensure we didn't have to wait more than a few minutes between courses, and did not forget about us when the place got busy at around 6:30.

I was disappointed about their salmon tartar served on a bed of lentils, under some beets and pickled beets. The pickled beets were too overpowering. Then came my main entree - the sesame crusted tuna was cooked to perfection! Dessert was also great- the almond- orange cake was small in portion, but very rich, also served with a scoop of fragrant vanilla ice cream. The servers definitely made it a lovely experience!
