4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw We typically visit Las Vegas every year and only eat breakfast at Mon Ami Gabi in Paris. Great service. Great food....the date glazed bacon....so good!  Also love the blueberry french toast with whipped cream. Best experienced on the outside patio across the street from the Bellagio fountain.
