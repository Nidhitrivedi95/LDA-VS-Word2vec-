rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Perfect place for sunday brunch and its been a traditional that we come for sunday brunch after a crazy saturday night. love that they have fresh squeeze juice because that is the only way i like my juice. the beignets are so amazingly good and what better than housemade jam and nutella to go with. it was breakfast heaven. of course the oysters were fresh and ohhh so yummy mmmmmmMMMMmmm. i had the special for that day and everytime ive come ive always ordered the special and it was always spectacular! however that leaves me unable to eat the regular menu which i have been wanting to do everytime im there. unfortunately once the waiter/waitress starts telling me about the special of the day its so hard not to order that. still want to try the chicken and waffles and the french toast OMG that will be the goal next time im there. Last time here i treated myself and two others and it came out to 150. not cheap to eat but anytime your at a thomas keller establishment this is the kind of price tag you are looking at but you will definitely get the most bang outta your buck here. food wise at least lol.
