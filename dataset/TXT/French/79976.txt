ZuYsZvJ5r32Fs70vPXbRgw The two stars are only for the food. The service here has made me livid. Firstly, we waited for an hour before our first course. 40 minutes until our second. Then the waiter seeig that I am visibly displeased tells my girlfriend next time she comes dont bring me. He just cut his tip in half. I understand French humor but it usually comes with a side of French service. Never coming again.
