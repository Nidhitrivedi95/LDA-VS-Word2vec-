-4TMQnQJW1yd6NqGRDvAeA House Brasserie, you're such a flirt. You weren't even modest about it, you flaunted that sensuality before I reached for the door, tarted up in your tinkling necklace of lights and gown of vine. I have to admit, I was smitten. For a dame of such established pedigree (I hear you're the second eldest home in all of Scottsdale), you're Rita Hayworth, Katharine Hepburn and Grace Kelly wrapped in kale and orecchiette: divine.

You titillated me with your silken, endlessly long crab legs, lime buttered above the heel. I wanted to peel and eat your spicy shrimp, but that would've been a little too adventurous for a first date, so I... chowed down. Immediately I cooled my fiery palate with your amazing kale salad, something we both agreed was both delectable and smart from a dietary perspective. But oh, how our sensibilities were fast to wane as you prepared cocktail after fabulous cocktail...

Your Chateau Briand, oh my! Delectable. Lobster Friend Rice: it's an Asian fusion love affair! Broccoli Carbonarra: you have me at your doorstep. Marinated Jidori Chicken: I'm swimming in your silk sheets. So get it over with already, Brasserie. Take me.

You did. I feel like such a floozy. Your crumb cake and sacher torte made me your slave. I'm done. I don't want to talk about it anymore. I feel used.

And I WANT MORE.

Don't get me started on your wallpaper...
