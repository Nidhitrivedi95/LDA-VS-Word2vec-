SBnpT6JDbah-5l_52GM5sw I don't get out early enough in the day for brunch, so I went here for dinner. The location is really nice. It's right on the lake and the decor inside of the building is lovely. We went earlier in the evening and missed the entrance the first time while trying to navigate the traffic, but the silver lining was their private parking lot.

The food was amazing. We tried the pâté while everyone was making up their mind about entrees. I'm usually not a pâté fan, but it was soft and bursting with flavor and meshed well with the bread and mustard. Worth the calories. 

I ordered the salmon and it was cooked to perfection. The fish itself was 'melt in your mouth' deliciousness. At first I was worried this place was going to be one of those that tries to be fancier than it really is and only serves you super small tasting portions, but the food was more than enough. I'm a lentil fan by nature, but the way they cook theirs and the sauce they smoother them in makes them the best I've ever had.

And the frites! I didn't care that I had already eaten my entree, when my dining partner couldn't finish them I couldn't say no. They are thin without being crunchy; and not oily. 

The only downside was that I seemed to come here on an off day for the service. Other reviewers rave about the service so take my comment about it with a grain of salt, but the waitress totally disappeared after giving us our menus and luckily I was in good company or after the 15 minute wait to get her attention we would have ran out of things to say to each other.
