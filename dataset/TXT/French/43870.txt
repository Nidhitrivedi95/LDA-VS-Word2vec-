m9aFZk1f8tSv248YErbpQA Awesome place. First good sign of any ethnic place: when you walk in and see people from the home country. Half the people in the place were speaking French, which only added to the experience. Owner and we assume her family greet you when you walk in, and all of them are gracious and pleasant. 

We did not get a chance to sit on the patio, though it was large and looked very nice. Misters kept it cool as well. 

K had the Chez vous crepe and I had the Forestiere crepe with coffee. Coffee was very good, and K loved her hot chocolate. Honestly looked like everything on the menu was delicious. Staff was attentive and did not rush us. Definitely a beautiful place to go if you want to sit, enjoy a nice wine and good brunch food. Our only regret was we didn't get to try the dessert crepes. That's next week.
