6fPQJq4f_yiq1NHn0fd11Q I've had real crepes in Paris and none have ever been as salty as the one I ate at this place. I had the one with prociutto and boy was it salty. I had to pick out the pieces so I could justify finishing it up. Most of it I threw away because it was making my stomach hurt. I doubt I'll ever give this place a second chance. Two stars.
