SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ Legit - mostly due to the atmosphere and excellent food.  I've been meaning to check this place out for quite a while - just needed a good excuse to celebrate.  The only time I cannot fathom loving this place is when it's too warm to enjoy the patio.  There's even a mascot!  We were visited by the official cat of the House Of Tricks and even though I'm not a big cat guy, this one was really sweet.

The cocktails were delicious and everything we ordered was really tasty.  The service was superiors and I only hesitate to give five stars due to price - this was not a cheap meal.  I think between the four of us it came to about $350.  Granted, we didn't hold back, and we were celebrating, but that's still rather steep.  

It's tough to say whether or not I'll be back, but I won't say no if the group decides to do so.
