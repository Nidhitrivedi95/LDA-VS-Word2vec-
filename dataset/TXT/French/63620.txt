t1mR_Zff6Dqv1TueE2JLEA So pretty and the food was great! I loved the chiffon curtains and decor, it was really nice. My boyfriend and I went here a week ago and it was delish! We did the four course menu and I was soooo full afterwards. I had the harira, rolled chicken pastry things, salmon and a flourless chocolate torte. The harira is incredible, I could eat it everyday. The dessert was incredibly rich and I only had a couple bites. Overall it was great!
