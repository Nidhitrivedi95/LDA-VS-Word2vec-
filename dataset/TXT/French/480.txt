-Mz3M0g6iFZczs6a7ddf5g Can't decide if you want sushi or Italian? Have someone good at finagling reservations? Then get yourself to Le Serpent, the hottest ticket in town. Located in a jumble of warehouses, it is edgy and artsy from the minute you walk through the door till the small, beautiful plates arrive at your table. The crudo was a poem. I had orichietti and a cod entree with chanterelles and courgettes. Dessert was raspberry mousse and sorbet. Highly recommended.
