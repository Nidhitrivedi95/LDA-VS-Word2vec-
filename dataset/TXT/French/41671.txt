kKC7UTcHZM3zLfT97x3msg Oh my..what a great experience.

What we ate:
Fresh oysters: (4/5) nice and fresh!
Roasted duck breast with foie gras and polenta: (5/5) Holy moly...might be the best duck breast we ever ate
Catch of the day...seafood plate: (5/5) I wish I could have licked my plate..fresh salmon, scallop, squid ink ravioli stuffed with crab.
Blueberry creme brulee: (4/5) Not too sweet and very light!

Drinks: Caesar (3/5), Let the Sun In (5/5), Pinot Gris (5/5)

Complimentary: Lovely mini app, amuse bouche, and olive+ bread platter.

Service and food were top notch...I think you can see that I am a big fan! You get what you pay for -and more!
