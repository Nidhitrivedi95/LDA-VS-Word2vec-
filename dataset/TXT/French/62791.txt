SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ We made a reservation for 5:45pm on Saturday 6/18 and we did not eat there!  When we got there even though we had a reservation they said there were no tables inside that we needed to eat outside on the Patio.  It was 112 degrees out and we were all dressed up to go to ASU Gammage theater that night.  I can't believe they wanted people to eat outside.  I know they had misters but really!!!!! Also the girl said people came at 4:30 and 5:00 and took all the inside tables and they would not have any for 1 1/2 hours??????? DAH don't you think you should have responded to our reservation that you didn't have inside sitting anymore and then we would not have drove for 40 minutes from Fountain Hills to Tempe to eat!!! NOT GOOD!
Will Not return, bad service!!!!!
