mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q I may be walking around with a bit more of a spring in my step now that I have dined on the cuisine of the chef of the century.

The are a few tasting menus to choose from.  We didn't partake.  Approximately 3/4 of the menu is small plates ranging in price from $25 - $35.  1/4 of the menu is entrees ranging in price from $40 - $90.  

The small plates mean small.  Each plate is 3 - 4 bites.  Our server recommended 4 per person.  

Pardon my French - (I don't know any) -  we had the seared foie gras with quince, sardines and eggplant, onion tart, kobe and foie gras sliders, foie gras stuffed quail, oysters, poached egg with truffle.  Everything was delicious.  The plates were exquisite - almost too pretty to eat.     

For entrees, we had the pepper crusted filet, hanger steak, and sea bass.  They use the term entree loosely  as it is still a very small portion.  For example, my bass was a 4 oz. sliver with 6 artichoke hearts and 1/2 whipped potatoes.  Aside from size, it was flavorful and lovely.  The whipped potatoes both look and taste like pure whipped butter.  They are unbelievably decadent.  I'm not sure there is even any potato in there!  The filet was the standout.  The meat was absolutely sublime.  Nothing less than expected from the $72 price tag.  

The one  major disappointment was the bread.  I expected excellence and got dry overbaked, mediocrity served with cold unspreadable butter.  Tisk tisk.

The service was flawless but paced.  The long lapses are to be expected in this sort of dining.  

I have yet to determine if the meal was worth the $580 price tag, but it was delicious and lovely.  A nice experience.
