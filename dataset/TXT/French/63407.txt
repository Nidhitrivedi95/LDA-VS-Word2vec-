SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA Amazing food here. I ordered the frisée and bacon Larson salad and the porky belly was delicious. It had a runny yolk on top. 

Also had the cassoulet with duck confit sausage and pork belly. I switched out the lamb sausage for extra duck confit for an extra charge. 

Fried Cauliflower is the best!
