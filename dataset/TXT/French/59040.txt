rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w To dine at Le Cirque is to experience authentic French fine dining.  Located in the back of the Bellagio Casino, the atmosphere is amazingly quiet and a bit aristocratic.  The service could not be improved upon; it was truly wonderful.  As one example, a partial table-over-cloth was brought out lest there be a stain in view.  My guest was offered a black cloth napkin to better match her dress; she also received a complimentary jewelry box as a gift.

The menu was fixed - you were required to order a 3 course meal which started at $98.  The food was very good; I had the lobster salad (good, not great), and the duck (again good, not great).  My guest had the beef (which cost an extra $45) which was very good.  

The desserts were quite awesome, souffle was delicious, although after two courses, it was hard to find room to enjoy it.

Overall, this place should be reserved for the wealthy or those celebrating a special occasion (or if you really want to impress someone).  It was very expensive, but it was a thoroughly memorable dining experience.
