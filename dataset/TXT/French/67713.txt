UxWH8zRYIBgs6Q2oykvRdw I thought the atmosphere was lovely. And I enjoyed the wine selection. However, the food was well below what the website and atmosphere and price would have suggested. My appetizer (The spicy salmon tartar) was alright but bland, not the "spicy" taste as advertised. My guest got the escargot which was good.

The mains were disappointing. Mine, the fish stew, was more like slightly flavored water. The flavors had not been developed at all and the seasoning was non-existent. My guest got the meal ball, the meat itself seemed fine but the sauce was like something out of a can. Lots of dry spices and I believe garlic powder. For the cost $125 after tip, I was very disappointed. I don't write reviews, but I had to in this case.
