4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Absolutely delicious!!!  We went for my birthday dinner while in Vegas and sat on the patio for a great view of the Bellagio Fountains. I had the 9 oz steak with the bernaise sauce and it was perfect. Also the freshly baked bread was amazing. Hot and fresh right out of the oven. I highly recommend it!
