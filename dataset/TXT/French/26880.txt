Dcj69NZJnbJhK-YHP_nULA My girlfriend and I decided to try this place just off campus due to solid personal and Yelp recommendations. Initially, we weren't sure dinner would arrive at all; the server explained that a plumber was repairing something, and no one knew when it would be completed. But the situation was resolved within ten minutes of being seated, and we had an enjoyable dinner (despite the poor acoustics of the place causing sound to reverberate forever). Good burger, good fries, and good beer; so I've got nothing to complain about. But it just was not forty dollars and a drive across town good.
