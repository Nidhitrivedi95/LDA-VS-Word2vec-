FChZqoNWuLZr5Lj28Cq7yg I have been to Tartine twice now, most recently with my wife and her parents this past Saturday for brunch.  Whenever you walk through the doors of this establishment you are immediately transported to what I have been told is an authentic French experience.  There is a display case with pastries and desserts whenever you first walk in along with some tables.  Further back there are also some more tables as well as some nice looking mirrors and other French decor.  There is also some older French music playing in the background giving it a nice ambiance.  Both times that I have been here I have been greeted and talked to by the owner which I have enjoyed.  This last time I was also able to meet his adorable service dog who was always near him.

For my brunch entree this time around I went with the A La Benedict which is pretty much your traditional eggs benedict while our table also decided to split a side of sausage and a savory pear and blue cheese dish.  While I personally was not such a big fan of the split dish, the rest of my table raved about it so I figure that it had to be me.  Of course the reason that I found that dish to be not as good is that my eggs benedict were stellar.  Everything about it came together nicely as the saltiness of the ham combined with the richness of the egg yolk and some slight sourness of the hollandaise formed a meal that I could eat over and over again.  As with most dishes there, it also came with a side of potatoes lyonnaise which were also very good and left me feeling pretty full.  The previous time I visited I was also very pleased with the Jambon crepe that I had.

The bottom line for me is that I will definitely be back here again in the future.  Everything about this place is great from the ambiance to the food and even the owner.
