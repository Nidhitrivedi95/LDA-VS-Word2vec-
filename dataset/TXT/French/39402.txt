jSfnItqaOnEp2nenVF7fCg Went here based on the reviews. Today I had the wife and child with me so I thought we would try a new place. Let me start by saying the location is good, the decor is simple but works for the style they are going for. This is where your fine dining experience will end. Normally when I spend over $50 for lunch I don't expect frozen meats and to hear a microwave cooking things constantly. Not the case here. The Cabernet burger was alright but nothing I'd write home about. The fries were good, but frozen. The special of the day was a fettuccine alfredo dish that was visually appealing but lacking in flavor. Bland and runny white sauce. The croissant appetizer is worth getting and they seemed to be made fresh. This was the highlight of the meal.

The service was prompt in the beginning but quickly faded as the restaurant filled to capacity. No real organization to it and seems like either one more server would help balance the load, but could also create an even bigger traffic jam. 

Overall, 2 stars. Food was marginal, table service was as good as it could be. A nice concept but poorly executed.
