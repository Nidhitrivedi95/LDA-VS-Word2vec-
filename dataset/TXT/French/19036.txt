ANHCo9X7zu0LdYecc9fk3Q Stopped by this place to grab a quick lunch before flying home from Phoenix.  Decided to get a massive spinach salad for $8.11 to get some greens in.  They have a lot of other French options like quiche and stuff that looked a bit heavier and would take longer to prepare, so I didn't go for those.  Just grabbed my to-go salad from the fridge case.

Spinach, mushrooms, roasted pecans, bacon, red bell pepper, and strawberries in a balsamic vinaigrette...  my meal did hit the spot for some much-needed micronutrients after a week of heavy meat and starch gluttony.  But I had dumped my entire container of dressing over my salad, and it was a bit thick and heavy, so I think I had overdressed my salad.  Probably half of it would have been sufficient, oops.

But a good meal with seating area right next to the gate, so I hope it was a healthier meal option than McDonald's before my flight.
