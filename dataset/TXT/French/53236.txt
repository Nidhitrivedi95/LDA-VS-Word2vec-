QeFsIMcIFIJcOrpthYL8jg Modavie is a great place to get a drink and soak up some really exceptional live jazz...but skip dinner. My fish was (and I hate to slam any restaurant based on one meal) but it was simply terrible. My girlfriends steak was similarly bland, chewy, string and not cooked properly. Such a disappointment.  Having said that the place is really gorgeous, great decor, great atmosphere, great bar. You've a great spot, but really, up those standards at the pass folks.
