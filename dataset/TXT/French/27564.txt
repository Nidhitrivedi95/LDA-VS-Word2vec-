DJcvnN7BCiqOUAra35xYuA I was surprised to see Bonjour Vietnam had been replaced, but I was pleased that it had been replaced with Rice Paper.  I had heard good things about the other location on 7th Street and have been wanting to try it out.  Rice Paper lived up to expectations.  I'm not an expert on Vietnamese cuisine, but what I had was very good - the Saigon salad with grilled chicken.  My lunch mate had the Enlighten Me roll with a side salad and enjoyed it as well.  Delivery of the food took just slightly longer than I would have expected, but it wasn't a big deal.  It was nice out.  If you had been to Bonjour Vietnam previously, the decor and seating are basically the same at Rice Paper.  We sat outside on the Monroe side.  I was in the sun and would have been a little warm were it not for a pleasant breeze.
