He put a ratatouille inside the corn meal sandwich like tort. It lacked in any seasoning whatsoever. No salt or herbs and the cornmeal was underdone! Gummy inside. To top it off, it came with a side salad and half of the lettuce was black and rotten. I did mention that and they took $5 off the plate which was $17! We also shared a beet arugula salad. It came with a salty white cheese, dates, pistachio and balsamic dressing. The salad was decent and it saved the day. However, it was just so so. The chef did apologize for the lettuce. Still we both left hungry. It's a pretty little place, but a touch pricey. If the arepas were done and seasoned I think I would have bumped the stars up a notch.
