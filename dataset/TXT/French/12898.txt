4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Had a great birthday dinner!  Steak frites, yum!  Great cut of steak, killer frites ( hint: order them crispy!). Really lovely server.

Returned Sat. for breakfast, they lost our order and we waited a long time for food.  Very good when it finally came out! Manager was great and comped us on part of the meal, very apologetic,  server was mealy and obviously ready or his shift to end.

Will go back there again.  ( mon Ami's keep some milk at the wait stations, I had to ask numerous times to get some for my coffee both iits, why does staff has to go to the bar for it?)
