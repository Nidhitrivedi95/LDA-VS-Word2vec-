4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Five star food, but slight problems with the service and a greater problem with the ambiance.

The most important point here is where you sit.  They have outside seating right on the Strip - great for people watching and a view of the Bellagio fountains show.  HOWEVER:
1.  You can't reserve a table outside - you can get put on a list and it may be a long one.
2.  Despite heaters and misters, it gets hot or cold and you may want to reconsider if the outside air temperature is under 60 or over 100 (during the day, over 90).
If you sit insider, where most of the tables are located, it is crowded and fairly noisy.  Some of the cushion style seats are uncomfortable, particularly if you have to sit on a seam between cushions.

The service is friendly and knowledgeable, but they are always in a rushs.  This is not the place for a leisurely dinner.

One word about the food, which is uniformly good:  the steaks frites are superior.
