xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g This place is my first classy/up scale restaurant so I felt somewhat out of place since the most upscale place I've been to is like... Cheesecake Factory. But my "expensive" friend wanted my bf and I to experience this place because he loved it the last time (and it is vegas after all), so I decided to come here to have an experience. And wow, what an experience. I felt like I was in a romantic show/movie. The waiter seated us ladies first and then the guys. Even pulled out the seats for us (and my bf doesn't even do that for me!) The bathroom has attendants, whom I forgot to tip because I didn't know that was standard etiquette. And the food portions were tiny but amazingly they were filling. I forgot what I ordered because I came here about a year ago, but I remember it having spinach and some hard rice cracker type thing on top. I thought it tasted way too salty but my bf seemed to love it. Overall, it was an interesting experience. I wouldn't mind coming here again for special occasions.
