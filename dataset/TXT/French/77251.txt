YUFxSG6idHePsxOmnSHtpQ Can you say "carrot raisin muffin?"  Can you convince your breakfast mates to order the same and give them to you?  My poor husband knows the "drill" all too well!  They taste like good old fashioned carrot cake - just the right amount of nuts.  I really like Mimi's for breakfast (truly something for everyone,) and on breakfast, I give them four stars.  The reason for three, is lunch and dinner...nothing at all special.
