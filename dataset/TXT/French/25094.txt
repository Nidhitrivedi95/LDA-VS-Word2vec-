Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA Another LV casino, another expensive restaurant.  Mix is your standard high-end French LV restaurant.  Compared to similar restaurants, I believe Mix is a bit overpriced for what you get.  That said, I don't particularly value the one thing that makes Mix stand out as a restaurant  against its competition, which would be its spectacular view from the top of Manadalay Bay.  The food is competently prepared and tasty, but you will pay through the nose for it.  I think the decor is lovely, but it should be for a restaurant this expensive.  The service was fine for a restaurant at this level.  At prices that are slightly less, I believe there are better experiences to be had - in fact, I'd pick Fleur de Lys right in the same property over Mix - however, if you want to have dinner and a spectacular view, it's hard to imagine a better place than Mix (The food here is much better than Voodoo at the Rio, and the view is better here too).
