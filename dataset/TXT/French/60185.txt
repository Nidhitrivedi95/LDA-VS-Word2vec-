SBnpT6JDbah-5l_52GM5sw Don't hate me. I'm not in love with Sardine.

Positives:
1) Great service!
2) They take reservations
3) Good coffee, unlimited refills.
4) My friends loved it.

I ordered the creamed eggs, which were both oily and watery (runny whites) at the same time. I didn't hate them, but I also didn't finish them. I was quite bummed since a lot of people raved about the creamed eggs in their reviews here, but I just wasn't a fan. With so many great brunch options in Madison, I'm not sure I'll return. Their mussels and frites do look tempting, though...perhaps one day.
