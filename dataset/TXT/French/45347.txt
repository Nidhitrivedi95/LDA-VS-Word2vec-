mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q We had a fun experience eating at the bar yesterday. The restaurant has a very contemporary, Asian influenced atmosphere. It is a lot smaller then I expected.  Overall, we had a good experience dining here. Will be returning to try their other creations in the future. 

In order to try more dishes without doing the 10 course seasonal menu at $155pp, my hubby did the 5- course Menu Club selection for $95pp and I did 2 small portion dishes with one regular entree for $104. It worked out perfectly since it allowed us to try all the dishes we wanted to try. I got the Kusshi oysters, foie gras stuffed quail, and the Maine lobster salad. Overall, the stand out dishes for me were the lobster salad & vegetable fondant with avocado cream amuse bouche, absolutely delightful- light, refreshing, and balanced flavors. My hubby enjoyed la langoustine, bread, and tarts desserts. Yes, bread. He is a fan of baguettes and they have light, crisp but slightly chewy baguettes plus mini croissants, and dinner rolls that are served at the beginning and constantly refilled.

The only thing with sitting at the bar is they don't keep your water filled as consistently. That's one of my pet peeves at restaurants. I'm happy if my water is always kept full. Unfortunately, that didn't happen here. I would expect more from a one Michelin rated restaurant.

 At this point, I'd already spent over $300 on food over the course of one day. Although it was a good experience overall, I probably wouldn't return for a while. But it does pique my interest for the Joel Robuchon restaurant. We'll be saving up to go there. $385pp. Yikes!! With no wine pairing.
