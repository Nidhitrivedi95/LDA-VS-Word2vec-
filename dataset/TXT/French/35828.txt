hvjgF-vnPw2jyL5DBuB0qg My friend and I sat at the bar on a weekday night at a 9:30 reservation. It was a wonderful night made special by Morgan who made our seafood plate. We had the Lobster Poutine, a salad and split the medium seafood plate. I definitely will return and ask for a seat at the bar again. The music set the atmosphere, the staff was super friendly; it felt like we were at a get together for a large extended family. Thanks to all of you especially Morgan for a great night and an outstanding meal.
