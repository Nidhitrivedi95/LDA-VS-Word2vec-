50-xiTYmE6NERi-yJ6NvHw The food was amazing!!! And I'm a very picky eater. 

However, I don't think they take instructions well. I didn't want Brussel sprouts and specifically told them not to include it. Only for my meal to arrive and what did I see? Brussel Sprouts. 

This was my first time eating there though so I'm going to give it another try next time. I keep you updated. 

P.S The drinks(cocktails) are superb
