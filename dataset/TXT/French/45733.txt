The wine selection is truly amazing (we had a white burgundy which was the single best white wine I ever had). We went on a thursday late and the service was very good. Some of the people may not understand the way Joel Robuchon prepares the menu and that is his kind of Bistro sister property to the more formal restaurant. If you like innovative french food, prepared fresh and with unique twist and understand the portion and prices - you will have a great experience.
