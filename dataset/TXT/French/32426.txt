gxMa7j1LXIUxxBoP0osDpA What a top notch BYOB place!! Have the tartar - but menu changes often! For a 6pm sit down, we came early at about 5:45 and they were happy to allow us to sit and start with the wine. Everything about the place was excellent. Service especially was great! For a place with two sittings, they did not rush us at all - all the food was perfectly timed for us even though we were at a different pace than others and were splitting dishes
