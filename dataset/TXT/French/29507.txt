Quaint Belgian cafe with warm staff and smiles.  Free wifi, light food, and very good value.  ($2 cup of coffee, delicious, no refills but who cares).

Ham & Cheese omelette croissant sandwich had fluffy eggs, not salty, and served warm with melting cheese and a few bites of salad.

Husband modified his as vegetarian and the staff happily complied.

We were even gifted a huge Madeleine cookie as a treat!  Perfect brunch meal on the weekend.
