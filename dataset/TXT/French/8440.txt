4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Was just there for Saturday lunch in December 2009. Started with a fresh hot baguette for the table..which was delicious. Crunchy and soft in all the right places. 

I got the Croque Monsieur ..that was divine! Ham and cheese and a fried egg.. on great bread. So so good!! My friend got the special of the day, which was a duck and fig open faced sandwich, which was spectacular as well. Someone else at the table got the steak sandwich..which was plain compared to our two dishes. It wasn't bad, it was just bland and boring. He ended up eating some of my sammy. 
My other friend had the Eggs & Beef Bourguignon and said it was mediocre at best.. 

Becareful of the mimosas. We got a couple..and when the bill came it was $10 a pop!! So not worth it, since you can get unlimted mimosas at all the brunch buffets for like $5. And they tasted the same.
