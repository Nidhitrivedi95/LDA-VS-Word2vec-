mnn--vaYHtNyBNYFYBFIog The food was good, but certainly nothing special. The service was excellent. Judging from the other reviews, the tasting menu seems to be the way to go. We were in a bit of a rush so opted for a la carte. We started with a few oysters, which were disappointing. Our main courses consisted of the suckling pig loin and the tagliatelle, both of which were very ordinary. 

I've read reviews to the contrary, but I found the decor very tacky. The purple walls didn't work, and the background music made us feel like we were in a hotel lobby. The place lacked a drop of warmth.
