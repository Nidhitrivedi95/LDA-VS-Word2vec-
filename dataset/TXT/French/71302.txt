xcmmTXhuMx2fZF2Bt69F4w On a whim we decided to take our 3 kids, aged 9, 6 and 4 out to dinner tonight.  I called up to confirm that they weren't too busy and we rolled in to find the place busy, but with a couple of tables open.

Great, friendly and prompt service, essential when you are travelling with kids :-)

But the food, the food is why we were there.

All I can say is wow.  WOW. My wife ordered the Moules, red curry sauce; and we thought it was good, damn good, until I tried my Carbonnade Flamade.  Beef braised in Belgian brown ale.  WOW.  Mouthwatering good.  I love you but I am *not* sharing this with you, good. Paired with a Chimay Blanche, I was in heaven.

I have heard of Point Brugge for some time and never managed to get around there until tonight.  I will be going back, and soon.

To be clear, this is not a 5-star restaurant.  You can probably get better food elsewhere.  But, this is a simple concept delivered very well.  The atmosphere is very homely, comfortable and inviting.  The service friendly and efficient.  The food met or exceeded my expectations, and these were set pretty high.

As we were leaving, around 7:15, we walked past a long line of people waiting for a seat, so my suggestion would be to be early if you can...
