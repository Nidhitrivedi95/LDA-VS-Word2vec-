SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA Excellent restaurant with nice ambiance (fireplace and patio for seasonal needs), great service and excellent food. They bring grilled gluten free bread on request, and also made me a French onion soup with it! The soup is hearty and full of tender beef. The house smoked salmon is also good, and the steak frites is fab. Parking!
