AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw I was staying in Caesars Palace and this is very close to the Palace Tower elevators/Pool area.

I wanted a quick, real, breakfast alone before having to work a conference booth later that day by myself. I had a berry breakfast crepe and orange juice. 

The crepe was very light and delicious. They make it fresh and only between certain breakfast hours. Huge glob of creme with some not too sweet berries. The orange juice still had some pulp. Prices are on par with everything else on the strip. $6 orange juice. $13 crepe. I sat at one of the small tables and just relaxed. Enjoyed the 8 am quietness versus the late night drunken rowdiness of the nearby casino floor.

It really hit the spot though and was better than the standard fruit and pastries I knew they would be offering me at the conference.
