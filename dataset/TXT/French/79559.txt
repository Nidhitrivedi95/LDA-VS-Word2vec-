zqNgwQjj0_XAll-neGikIw Can not say enough about this truly delightful little restaurant. We have been eating here since it originally opened under the name "Scratch" and it just gets better & better. Croissants & Macaroons (try the rose or pistachio) are great, the Crab cake burger has a light touch (when served with the fries its a piece of heaven for lunch) and my absolute favorite is to pair the Muscles in white wine & garlic with Duck Confit & herbed french fries - wow - bring bottle of your own wine (BYOB) and what could be better !!!!  If you want a laid back quite venue where you can eat locally sourced produce and hang out with friends this is the spot ( its a small operation so service can be a bit slow)  Chef Duc is a Treasure - In a valley filled with great high end chain chain restaurants this simple venue is a stand out.
