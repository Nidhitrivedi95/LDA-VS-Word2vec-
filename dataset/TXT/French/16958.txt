GUESTLIST
So we went for a friend's bday party and they didn't have us on the guestlist even though we had a confirmation. They kept saying that our name is probably on the other list they have (why don't all the ppl serving the guestlist have the same list?).  But they never went to check their colleagues' list. 

Although after much discussion, they said they trusted us and would be willing to let us in.  We also showed them the confirmation on our phone after this discussion (it took us a while to find it). 

MUSIC
bah! They repeated the songs over again through the night. I didn't like that.

They brought back alot of old music (motown area, old pop songs). If you're into that, then it was great.

CROWD
Much older crowd. I would say both the men and women were in their late 30's, 40's and 50's.  Everyone was there to have a great time but for some reason there was much more shoving than usual. I don't understand why.

I'm still not a fan of this place but if you go with a good group of friends, it's ok.
