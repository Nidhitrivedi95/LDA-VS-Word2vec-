Right away, the great modern decor is apparent and stands out amongst the other nearby Italian places which are a bit run down (to varying degrees).
The prices are very reasonable too with all the pastas under $20 and most of the entrees under $30. Lunch menu is even cheaper of course and they offer some items tailored to that period (Paninis etc..). I think they may do Sunday brunch too, but I'll have to confirm.

My wife and I told the waitress we had little time since we had an appointment and she said they could accommodate as long as we ordered pasta. My wife went for the 'penne a la vodka', and I had 'cassarecce con pollo' (a pasta with chicken in a cream sauce). Both were very solid dishes, made simply with proper ingredients. And of course they served us with the complimentary loaf of bread as we waiting.

Service was great and they made good on their promise to provide the food in a timely way.

I've just scratched the surface of the menu, but it's enough to warrant future visits
