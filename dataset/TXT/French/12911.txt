4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw We went here for a fantastic breakfast on our way out of town and I must say, I wouldn't have expected the kind of service we got at a 5 star dinner restaurant. The staff was on top of it all of the way through the meal. I never once had to ask for a refill, cal for a waitress or push my plate out of the way when I was done. The ambiance was great with white starched linen cloths and a French flair. I can't wait to go here for dinner.
