50-xiTYmE6NERi-yJ6NvHw Came to Biff's during my last trip to Toronto. My sister and her BF had been a couple of times and made reservations for a Saturday night.

First off, the service was great. We were greeted the minute we walked through the door and offered to check our coats. The busboy was attentive at filling up our glasses and clearing plates. Anthony paired our dishes with the perfect wines. He made some great suggestions on the menu and helped us pick some yummy dishes.

The atmosphere is very French bistro- wood tables & chairs, large windows, tall but simple floral arrangements. The decor was really chic and impressive.

We had a charcuterie starter with tons of obscure meats- from suckling to horse! The mustard served with the platter is delicious! I wish I had the recipe! We also got our share of 1$ oysters :)

Entrees were: 
- Duck confit with duck hearts and lentilles (5*)
- Sweetbreads (3*- acquired taste)
- Horse (5*)

We finished off with a cheese plate and profiteroles for dessert. We also got dessert cocktails and port to cap off a great meal.
