HcfwrlljJpfLh71znq47zw Phoarr!  This place is elegant, exquisite and by far the best Michelin star restaurant here in Edinburgh that I have tried so far.  I have yet to try 21212 or Balmoral No. 1.  I have been to The Kitchin & Castle Terrace and between the 3, this is by far the best.

I am not going into how all the food taste as we went for the tasting menu and there would be just too much of them to review and remember.  Unlike the other 2 Michelin starred restaurant that I have been to in Edinburgh, the food here was very consistent and the flavour and taste just exploded in your mouth with each and every course.  I will let the picture which I have taken speaks for itself.  How you imagine they would taste like from the picture, it was exactly how they tasted.  Let your imagination run wild.

Alternatively, if you have the money, please do come here for the tasting menu and you will absolutely not regret it.  I have been to the Gordon Ramsay Restaurant in London which is a 3 Michelin star and this place still trumps the Gordon Ramsay Restaurant.  I think this is a restaurant worthy of the next 2 Michelin stars.  Expensive but definitely a great experience.
