P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ Don't bother coming here if you're not going to book the chef's table. I mean, wow... My family and I had an excellent time! So attentive and welcoming... 10 courses of superb food... Chef Julien runs a well oiled machine of a kitchen! Extremely clean too! This dining experience was really such a treat- and you go home with a bag full of pastries too! Do yourself a favor and book the chef's table for your next special occasion- you won't regret it! ($550 per person up to six people- worth every dime! Gratuity included)
