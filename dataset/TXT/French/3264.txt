1cGyzWtfOoDiE8V0OR85yA I've been here once before, a while ago.  It's a cute place to have breakfast, lunch, or brunch during the weekend, specializing in crepes, as the name suggests.  I came for lunch on a Sat., and had a savory crepe with salmon, creme fraiche, and capers.  I recall it tasting fresh and delicious, though the specifics escape me since it's been awhile.  As a first-timer, I didn't have any problems with the service.  I enjoyed the atmosphere, which is bright, clean, and cozy.  I'd definitely like to come back to try a sweet crepe--if they were open during the evenings, I'd surely already have done this.  Their hours are 9am-5pm, which are a bit inconvenient during the week for those of us who work, esp. if we don't work nearby.  Cash only, but there's an ATM half a block away, on the corner of Craig and Fifth.  4.5 stars.
