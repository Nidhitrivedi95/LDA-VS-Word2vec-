nhKV-qbKUkFfXzf7DehbDw My friend was hosting and got a huge plate of takeout sushi from sushi shop and I'll admit, as a sushi junkie, I enjoyed it but afterwards it made me feel weird for the rest of the night. Can't comment on service or price-tag but the sushi rolls looked well and tasted good though.
