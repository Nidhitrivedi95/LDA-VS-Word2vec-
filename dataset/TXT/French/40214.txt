KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA I am a local. I have been to most of the best and most expensive restaurants in town. Marche Bacchus is my favorite. The food and selection are great. They have a wine store with a wonderful selection. The location is fantastic - on a lake. And the prices are reasonable. Try it, you won't be disappointed!
