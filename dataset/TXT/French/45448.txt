The food here is very difficult to describe, its at that level of quality that you can taste immediately - fresh, unique, new, and completely satisfying.  The drinks were outstanding as well, I recommend grabbing a couple while you wait.  We sat around the bar at the kitchen and it was very entertaining watching the chefs prepare our dishes.  

I know Vegas is expensive, but I'm not sure if the value was there.  I could get a similar meal in Chicago or another big city for much less (or would get a better meal at this price).  Don't get me wrong - you are going to have a special and unique experience - but you are going to pay the Vegas premium on top of an already expensive meal.
