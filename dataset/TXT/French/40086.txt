KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA I stopped in for lunch after getting a glorious massage next door at Spa at Lakeside 2.0.

I sat on the patio, with a lovely view of the lake. 

My quiche and salad were great, the salad was maybe a hair overdressed, but otherwise on point. 

Great place for a lunch date, I'll have to remember to bring my plus one next time.
