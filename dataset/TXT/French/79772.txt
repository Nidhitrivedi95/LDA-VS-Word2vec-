zqNgwQjj0_XAll-neGikIw To be fair I really do love this place and it deserves 3.5 stars. BUT, the service isn't the best and the food isn't consistent. If you go for a croissant call first because they have ran out 3 different times and the breakfast sandwich seems different every time I get it. Either way the food is great and the owners are the definition of lovely. 

The macaroons can't be beat! And I would highly recommend the crab burger! YUM!
