_cjPEH9wXhKS-HQe_U3M4Q I'm so impressed that everything tasted amazing, that I will Le Select Le Bistro as my future lunch/brunch spot! 

1. Croque-Monsieur $13.95 - This sandwich is the bomb! Covered with melted cheese with more cheese & ham in the middle, you might want to change your fries to a salad to keep the calories lower. The edges were perfectly crispy, and each bite was rich and delicious! 

2. Poulet Grille $16.95 - Grilled chicken breast on top of roasted zucchini, tomato & an arugula hazelnut piston. I don't know how they do it, but this is the juiciest chicken boob I've tasted. 

3. Confit De Canard $16.95 - the Yelp-famous duck leg confit! The skin wasn't crispy as stated in the menu, but the meat was very tender. It is served with potato au gratin, which will fill you up - otherwise portions are rather small. 

Service was a bit slow because of how busy they were. The clientele seems to be mostly business men in suits (wink wink) grabbing a quick bite. Everyone who works here appear to be fluent in French. My very Asian mother accidentally walked into the men's washroom because the sign was in French. Even their menu items were all in French with English descriptions on the bottom. Took me a while to decide what to eat. 

Parking in the back is cramped, with one lane to enter/exit. There's no back door entrance from the parking lot, so be careful of entering cars when walking around to the front door. 

I think it is general consensus that brunch is the most awesome meal of the day, but I must try their dinner menu some time!
