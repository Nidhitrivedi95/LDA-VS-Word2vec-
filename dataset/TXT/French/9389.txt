Definite fan of the seafood and ambiance. The roasted chicken was amazing, very moist and generous amount. The steak Bearnaise was less than I expected, way too much pepper and not enough steak.  Escargot was perfect, scallops gratin was good, but the scallops were too small (cut in half for those who can tell) Service was great, very nice and generous. We were also served a complimentary dish from the chef. 

All in all, come here if you are looking for an intimate meal, great seafood, and wonderful service...but not for steak.
