4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw First time here. The Wild Escargot was delicious with Pesto dipping sauce for your Baguette. Then for the entrée go for the Trout Almondine. Melts in your mouth. Sit outside and people watch. Even had a jazz player (street performer) playing music near our balcony. Could have been 5 stars but dislike the very long walk through the Paris casino to get to the restaurant. Wear flats. You'll thank me later.
