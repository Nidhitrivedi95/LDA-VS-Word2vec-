4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I've been here 3 times now in the last 12 months. Each time Mon Ami Gabi chefs outdid themselves. I've had the oysters, steak, mussels, and the Thursday Lamb Shank special.. everything was delicious! 
They have a great selection of wines as well as port wines. 
The service is always spectacular. If you can, request Keith for your waiter, he is a blast! Every time I am in Vegas, this is a must for a night out for me.
