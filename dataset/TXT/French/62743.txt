SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ Server was attentive but not overbearing.

The soup was outstanding while the Short Rib was a little too fatty for my tastes in places and the beans were simply decent.   I don't want to sound like I'm nitpicking though - the food on the whole was quite good.

The brownie desert was a rich melt in your mouth masterpiece although I did go home and eat some leftover pizza after because I was still hungry.

On the whole I had a perfectly fine dinner I just left feeling very blasé about the whole experience.  There was no "wow" factor and with those prices I can't justify more than a slightly above average 3.5 star review.
