SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ The ambiance is lovely on the patio and with excellent food, this proves to be a lovely romantic restaurant for dinner. The menu changes by seasons and I was recently disappointed that there was no quail on the menu. The service is good, could be a little better but all and all better then most upscale type restaurants. Overall dining experience is quite nice.
