All the while I was scarfing down this amazing meal I was able to watch the Habs on their bar-side television. The staff are so friendly and the chef went over the entire menu with me explaining every nuance and detail of his grub. Will definitely be back. It's also right next to Notre Dame des Quilles for a nightcap!
