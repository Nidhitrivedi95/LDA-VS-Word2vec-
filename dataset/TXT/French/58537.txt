RfsMUrGUJdrpfrU54rmEsQ We came with high expectations and we're not disappointed! Bruschetta board was fantastic. The Brie bruschetta was amazing. The blend of flavors is perfection. I had the cod and my husband had the filet mignon for our main dish. Both were flavorful and portioned well. The dessert was the best. You have to get the chocolate soufflé. If I could eat that all the time without getting fat I would. We will be back!
