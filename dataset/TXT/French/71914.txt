XI3iNUgChOfJk5ppjKVEQQ Nothing on the menu justifies the high prices!  Don't be fooled by the very seductive atmosphere; it is all show and no substance.  Food was edible but the prices leave a less than "buttery" (heard that before? - $19 glass of chardonnay!) taste in your mouth.  Short ribs are a tasty signature dish here...for inexpensive marinated meat priced at $39 we should have seen a substantial plate of ribs, we did not!  Take a seat at the bar if you must, listen to American pop standards (yawn) and share a glass of wine; eat elsewhere.
