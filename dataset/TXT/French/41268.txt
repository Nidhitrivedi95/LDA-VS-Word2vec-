kGOr_D-LNpgZ2M9N8TT4QQ Great spot to try out. The patio was very cute and all of the servers were friendly. The service was really good and food was served pretty quickly. My group of 4 were seated and served, ate and paid in just over an hour. The waffles were amazing, the quiche was very fluffy and tasty, and the eggs Benedict were average. Overall, I would recommend visiting and I would go again as well.
