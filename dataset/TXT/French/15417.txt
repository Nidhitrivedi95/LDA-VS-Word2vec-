6fPQJq4f_yiq1NHn0fd11Q Ordered the roasted chicken with sun- dried tomatoes and asparagus crepe and pesto sauce because there was no wait and wanted something quick. It was very good and was bigger than I expected. There's no sweetness to it like a dessert crepe. The chicken was flavorful but would like it to be more creamy. Other than that I thought it was quite filling.
