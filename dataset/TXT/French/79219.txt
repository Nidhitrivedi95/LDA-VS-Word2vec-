ZdaZwXC0FByDY3EwNELphw Looking at the menu at Union Restaurant and I asked the waiter "why does everything have pork, any way we can remove/substitute it?", and he responds in a condensing way "because we are in North America?".. At that point, I picked myself up, paid for my coffee, and walked away. I guess this restaurant doesn't want to serve a diverse crowd where some commit to follow a dietary restriction whether out of religious or personal choice.
