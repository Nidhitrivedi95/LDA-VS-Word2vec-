YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g We had extremely high expectations for Fleur de Lys and we were not disappointed - the food was exceptional - all of it.  Our waiter was very knowledgeable and pleasant, but service was very slow.  We agree that you should not be in a hurry when enjoying fine cuisine, but this was a little too slow.  It seemed to be the case across the board in the restaurant.  There were inconsistencies too.  For example, every lady in the room, except the 3 at our table, received a rose plucked from the huge rose filled wall sculpture.  Why not us?  If you want excellent food and you aren't in a hurry, and you don't mind being treated differently than other guests, we highly recommend Fleur de Lys.
