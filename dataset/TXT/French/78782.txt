ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug The service is not spectacular here (based on this experience and one prior experience by my table mates), but it isn't horrendous, either. Regardless of the service, I was extremely pleased with the food and the atmosphere. I would say it is the best value restaurant in Paris, especially if they have a three course meal special going on. I would choose this restaurant over The Sugar Factory any day (even taking into account the view Sugar Factory has), especially considering the cost difference between the two is negligible.
