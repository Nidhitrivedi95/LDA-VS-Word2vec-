j0baDQfMAGDm_QGdFMmb-Q What a gem of a restaurant in scottsdale.  Upscale bistro, but with a casual feel.  Wine list may be smaller bit with very nice choices.  We had the salmon tartar and scallop starters which were amazing.  The muscles are fresh and delicous.  Also had one of the specials.  Highly recommend for everyone to give this place a try, you will not be dissapointed!!
