5fquJHY2hMX9tPRD5s0t5g I can honestly say that I have never had bad service EVER. Haven't been here since November of 2013 and our server actually remembered us and what I ordered. Now that's service. If I've said it once I've said it a million times....in this day and age you are paying a lot for the food you eat. Probably too much so with that in mind the service better be good too and the service at Roosters in uptown Charlotte NC has never been anything less they fantastic.
