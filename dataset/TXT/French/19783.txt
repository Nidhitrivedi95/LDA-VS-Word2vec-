aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw After eating an amazing meal at Bouchon, I was excited to grab a snack from Bouchon Bakery a few days later.

I was actually hoping to try Thomas Keller's variation on the Oreo, but they were completely sold out, so I instead went with the old standby of an almond croissant.

It certainly looked the part; it was covered in almond slivers and dusted with icing sugar. But one bite let me know that things had gone very, very awry somewhere along the line.

Basically, the thing was hard as a rock. I couldn't even bite through it with my front teeth. I had to break off a piece and gnaw on it with my molars. Not exactly what you're looking for in a croissant.

The middle section was a little better, as underneath the rock-hard exterior was a filling that was pretty tasty. But getting there required a Herculean feat of chewing.
