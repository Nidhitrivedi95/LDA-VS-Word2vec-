d482l58ho0_IMdFkXX1F5Q Great dinner and experience!

Classic brasserie feel to the restaurant, felt like we were in Paris- but actually Venice :)

Started with tart Flambe, very light flat bread with a cream sauce, caramelized onions and bacon.  Perfect beginning, not too heavy but with great refined flavors.  The Burrata salad had a large soft creamy burrata ball onto of an artichoke heart.  Amazing.  Amazing.

Our waiter- Silvano pouched me to the duck confit over a burger.  Best choice ever.  Classic leg quarter, crispy skin, and juicy meat under.  The duck was succulent.  Best duck I've ever had.

In the world of celebrity chef restaurants with food for the masses...this chef is a chef before the celebrity status kicked in.
