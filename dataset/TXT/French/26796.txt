Da6eZFThE9xanUAGNpZxAg Nuit is a charming gem of a spot. First of all, the food is amazing. One of the most memorable dish I had there was the octopus gnocchi on their "Social Plates" menu (although it's not on the menu at the moment, but many of their other items are just as delightful). I also love that you can build your own charcuterie/cheese/olive board too, and the staff working there are very knowledgable and helpful with your selection. We asked our server to help select our cheeses depending on what we liked, and our cheeseboard was scrumptious. I think what elevated it was the housemate chutney/jams/mustards along with the selection of bread that was made in house. Tess is also a cocktail wizard. She is very knowledgable with the interplay of flavours. She invents her own cocktails as well as serving up a bunch of good old classics. And she also makes her own shrubs and syrups from fresh ingredients! There is also a good selection of wine for those more into wine. It is a tasteful and chill spot with good atmosphere/lighting/music that is good for anything from a gathering with a group of friends to a romantic date night.
