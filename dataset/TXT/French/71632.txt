XcWlBj5oQgzKhR7Cxovj3w Atmosphere: it's in an airport so it's not the best ambiance but it's fine for where it is. 

Service: our server was attentive and knowledgeable. 

Food: my mom had the ham and cheese sandwich she said it was very good and the ham was very good quality ham. I had the mac n cheese no ham and it was really good but a lot of mac n cheese with nothing else so I ate some of her fries.
