E9HkUYYO_-5vKjvBwLuDIw What a wonderful bistro! If you have ever traveled in Europe, you will be pleasantly surprised by the quality of food and the attention to detail. The service is superior to many restaurants as well as the warm and friendly environment. Pricing is a bonus! You will definitely be impressed by the owner and his staff. This is a special find in Summerlin. Can't wait to take family and friends to Oh la la!
