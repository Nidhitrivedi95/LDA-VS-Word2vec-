8ciT6qjI18x9EPtOb-gqYQ We used a Groupon at Coup des Tartes last week. What a cute little place! We decided we were going to indulge and started with the three onion tarte (per recommendations in other yelp reviews) and their roasted red pepper soup. The onion tarte was rich and pretty much melted in your mouth. I'm not normally a crust person, but theirs was very good. I love roasted red peppers, but I'm not a huge fan of soup versions. My boyfriend liked the spiciness of it, to me it was okay. 

We also ordered the arugla, artichoke, and tomato salad. This was also okay to me. I ate some, but decided it was more important to save room for our entrees. The entrees were impressive. We had the filet (very tender) and the lobster (great accompanying sauce). 

We also ordered dessert (mainly based on several raving yelp reviews). My boyfriend had a banana dessert and I had the mixed berry tarte. I loved the berries, but overall the dessert was a little sweet for me.

Some hits, some almost misses, but overall I'm a fan.
