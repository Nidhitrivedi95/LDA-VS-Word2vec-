Unless you're part of the 1% this isn't an everyday dining experience. If you are dining here, money should be no object, although the food and service will be worth every penny you fork out. 

We had a party of 4 and ordered the Innovation-Inspiration 12 course tasting menu with wine pairings (ordering this without the sommelier's handpicked pairings would be a colossal mistake). 

This is of course white tablecloth fine dining, but the host was warm and welcoming and did a nice job of keeping the stuffiness out of our experience. He was happy to share information on the courses, pronunciation help and fun tidbits about his native France. The sommelier modestly agreed with my suggestion that he has one of the best jobs in existence, and offered perfect pairings for each of our courses. 

I won't go into detail on the food, but suffice it to say that my expectations were shattered over and over again with each course. I couldn't pick a favorite course if I tried. They flowed seamlessly from one to the next and my only complaint was that we didn't always have time to mentally digest and discuss what we'd just eaten before the next course was upon us. Perfect timing in the kitchen...bummer.

If you can afford it, don't miss it.
