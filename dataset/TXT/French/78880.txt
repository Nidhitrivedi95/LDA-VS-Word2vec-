ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug this was the 2nd time my wife and I are here.   the food and service was awesome!

  we sat in the outside part and it made you think of a outside cafe in France.

  I got the special for $39.00 where you build your meal.

  I got a salad,ribeye,named potato with onions and peppers.

  the service was spot on.  seemed like my tea glass never got to halfway and it was filled back up.  my pet peave is when my drink is empty and no refill.

my wife got chicken with potatoes and mushrooms.  her portion was so large we could have shared it.

I had to take my dessert back to the room for later.  yummy cheesecake.

  my wife and I are there for our anniversary dinner.    

will eat here again!
