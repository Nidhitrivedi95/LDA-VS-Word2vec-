The service and food were very good. We were seated right outside the door of the main restaurant on the patio. 

Service was good and attentive throughout the entire meal. A few of us had the steak, others salmon and pasta. All of the meals were very good and came out fairly quickly. 

Dessert menu was great and we had a few of them. Creme brûlée was prepared well and very good. 

The only real downside to this restaurant is the noise level. It was so loud is was very difficult to carry on a conversation with all members at our table.
