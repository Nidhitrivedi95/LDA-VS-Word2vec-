WOO81gScY3_VpaIfXFAKpw We were looking for a dinner with something different. We found it in Cafe Bleu. If you have time and you enjoy watching your food get cooked we would say Cafe Bleu is a good choice. Dinner was EXCELLENT. It is fun to watch the wait staff because they are students from the Chef academy learning about all levels of the restaurant business. Our waiter was very knowledgeable but very nervous. After we told him we were enjoying our experience there, he lightened up. At the end we were given a card to rate our dinner and provide pointers for the students.
