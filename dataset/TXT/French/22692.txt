I ordered the steak benedict, the steak came out cooked the way I asked. Unfortunately it came out with scrambled eggs, I sent it back and it came out like it was supposed to. My friend ordered the strawberry and french toast, it was decent. The BLT "was good" "it tastes like a BLT." That was the feedback from the BLT. I ordered an iced coffee with the brown sugar flavoring. It was decent. Our server was slightly forgetful, he jacked up out order and it took him a while to bring things we asked for. All in all the consensus at the table was our food was good. At the time we got there we didn't have to wait, if we would have, I think the rating would have been lower.
