rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w Even after 2 years, this place still amazes. The food is exquisite, and the service beyond reproach. When I didn't like a wine in the pairing, the sommelier replaced it without hesitation. I guess I could go on and on more about the food and wine, but I think you get the point. 

My only complaint (I have to complain about something) was there wasn't the same flair, when serving the chocolate ball dessert, that we experienced the last time we were here. It was still delicious, just the same.

I highly recommend this place.
