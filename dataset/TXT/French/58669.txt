RmGjo_2kT5wDVoqJb_IDCg Room was smoky (kitchen smoke, not cigarettes) so they really will have to look at the ventilation before winter.

Very able waiter, Adam.

Great selection of interesting beer on tap at very fair prices (I think it was $6 a pint.)

The wine list though struck me as a profit making gouge - there aren't many Cote du Rhones worth $50 in a resto.

I dragged my partner down there specifically because I had read they served one of my favourite food items, sweetbreads (which are very hard to find these days and are a pain to prepare at home.) But what they did to these delicately flavoured thymus glands was a travesty (basically serve them like wings dosed in hot sauce)  and an insult to the calves that offered them up.

The pork chop was incredibly salty, to the point it made my head kinda spin (in a bad way.) Waiter explained that was a result of how they'd made it (cured I think, like bacon or duck confit). But they gotta find a way to get the curing done and then get some of the excess salt out before serving.

but overall, good value, a buzzing scene and pretty adventuresome cooking. I would try it again but will make more careful choices.

PS. Oh yea, should have added, don't forget your reading glasses and maybe a flashlight. the menu is printed in teeny tiny type almost impossible to read.
