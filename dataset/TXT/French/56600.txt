rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Holy goodness this place is great for brunch!!! Their pastries are light, flaky, and heaven.  I ordered the chicken and waffles and it was amazing! 

Picture this: waffles with bacon and chives  and vanilla bean butter!!! It's like they pulled all my favorite ingredients out of my head and made a miracle happen! The chicken was rotisserie and was quite tasty.

I've had Bouchon for dinner in Yountville before and was not very impressed but brunch in Vegas was spectacular!  It's worth waking up for and will be my staple Sunday brunch whenever I am in the city of sin!
