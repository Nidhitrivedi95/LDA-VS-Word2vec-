xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g Came here for a girls night out and this was our dinner spot before attending a show. I ordered the Muscovy Duck and I have to say that I have had better tasting food for less than $50. The duck lacked flavor including the foie gras sauce and the rice tasted like it was cooked in a orange juice deduction in lieu of the claimed red wine. Next, it took almost an hour to get our food which was quite a disappointment. Beware they charge 18% gratuity for parties 5 or more.
