aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw Friend of mine brought me back a box of macarons and they were delicious!  First off, the biggest macarons I have ever eaten/seen in my life!  On top of that, they were all equally soft and flaky but chewy on the inside with their delicious cream in the middle.  I am unsure about all the flavors I had, but for sure:  Vanilla, Pistachio, Chocolate and Raspberry.  My favorite was the Raspberry and Pistachio!  Overall, I would definitely visit for their macarons.  No complaints here :)
