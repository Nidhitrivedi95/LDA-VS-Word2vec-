9ET_RUNztevq4_OLAX80Gg As much as I hate Summerlicious, it is always a great excuse to try restaurants that I otherwise would only go with my parents, Cafe Boulud included. At $25, the 3 course lunch menu offered something different than just chicken penne and salad, in addition, the option to order from the regular menu was nice to have as well. 

Walking into the hotel for the first time, it was sleek, modern but surprised at the smaller sized space, the vaulting ceilings make up for it - and in a place like this, lots of opportunity for fancy instagramming.

The decor is modern, with big glass windows that let in a lot of natural light; walls are covered with some andy warhol type pop art I guess to give it a younger more trendy feel. 

Service was as expected from a place like this, our server friendly and joked around, but no extra effort made, really. 

The Summerlicious Menu 
my dad had the Heirloom tomato salad for appetizer - it was just some cut tomatoes in a broth, it didn't look amazing to me, but dad loved it
mom got the squid salad which had some calamari cooked up a few different ways. it wasn't tough and the salad dressing was quite tasty. 
for mains, my dad got the cumbrae beef - tender and juicy, and my mom some sort of seared fish. 
My main, i ordered off the main menu which was quite affordable for lunch at around $25 for calves liver. It was very very good.

For dessert was a brownie/mousse cake with a side of lemon sorbet which I ended up eating the entire thing without sharing - I felt bad for this, but this was very yummy. 

Overall, I would say a positive summerlicious experience and I would come back for a fancy lunch. The food is well worth the price tag, and reminds you of what yorkville is supposed to be.
