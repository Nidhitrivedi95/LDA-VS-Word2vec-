B56AYe5GNuavMDtwFsXqzA I had tried Petite Mason before at a Yelp event and always had intentions of going there.  My friend was visiting from Hawaii and wanted to eat something she couldn't have on the island. I figured French cuisine would suit us both.

This lil spot is tucked away off Scottsdale road. We arrived just past 5:00 pm and parking was a cinch.  Walking into the patio was cozy and adorable - beautiful plants and a little fire place in the corner.  We knew right away we wanted to sit outside because it was a gorgeous evening.

Our server was attentive and pleasant. To start we shared a salad with fresh yellow tomatoes.  For the main course I ordered bouillabaisse and white wine and my friend ordered filet mignon and a red wine.  I tried my friends beef; dare I say it was better than Durant's?  Blasphemy!  I know but it was so tender and juicy, it blew me away!  The bouillabaisse was good too; I've never had it before so I don't have anything to compare it to. The shrimp tasted a little over cooked but the broth it was so flavorful, I wanted to bring the dish to my lips and tip back my head and slurp it all down.

All in all, it was a superb dining experience and I will be back for sure.
