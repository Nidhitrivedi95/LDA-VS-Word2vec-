9ot8oInkYZTt6wkkGe__vQ Before I would give Auberge 5 stars but now unfortunately the service and food is not so excellent. But it has still gets 4 stars for its outstanding French food. They  just recently started the fall menu and that may be the reason for this downgrade. But hopefully they will improve soon.
