USleI8g1UVN9-9jm-b4uIg My boyfriend and I are from Rhode Island and we were in Charlotte for 4 days.  We wanted to go out to a nice restaurant while we were here and we found the Fig Tree restaurant.  Not only was the food amazing but the service was outstanding.  We had the filet mignon and the grouper with lobster tail and both dishes were incredible and full of a variety of flavors.  We've never had such an incredible meal.  Rich was our server and he was amazing, he was polite ,knowledgeable about the menu and extremely attentive, and he had a great personality to top it off.  Dustin was the server assistant on that night ,and he was also exceptional , he was on top of water and bread service, and you could tell he was doing everything he could to help Rich. We highly recommend dining at the Fig Tree!
