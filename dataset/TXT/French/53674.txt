I got there just before 7, so I went with the price fixe because they had some great options (steak, salmon, chicken).  The caesar salad was your classic caeser salad with fresh lettuce and good caesar dressing.  

The steak frite entree was ok.  A good portion sirloin with fries.  The meat was a little too thick for my liking and lacked any flavor.  The fries were very good here - perfectly crispy and just the right amount of salt.  

I also tried the salmon, which was better than the steak.  It's served with a light cream sauce and was cooked perfectly.  Not fishy at all.

The cherry clafoutis with ice cream dessert didn't appeal to me at all.  The cherries were mushy and the crust tasted a little like cardboard.  I recommend going with the chocolate fondant served over ice cream - a great way to end the meal.

Maybe the burger or other steak options are the way to go here, but I wasn't impressed with the food here.

TIP: Ask for a seat outside or by the window.  Stay until sunset and watch the shows out by the waterfall.  They run every 1/2 hour and are amazing.  Right up there with the Bellagio water show (very different, though).

A comprehensive, but expensive wine list doesn't add any stars.
