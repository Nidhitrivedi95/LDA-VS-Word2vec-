xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g I booked the 5pm dinner so my newly wed husband and I could get a window seat and watch the fountains. The only upsetting moment I had, was realizing the day was too windy and the fountains would not go off. We put that behind us as we ordered our cocktails. Let me tell you the Eiffel Affair is to die for! Fresh fruit in the bottom of my glass just soaked up the liquor. Yum! I ordered the scallops...delightful. The highlife was ordering the veal medallions. So glad I ordered that, they were so moist. My husband ordered the aged NY steak mid rare. Looked superb. I also ordered a customized cake (very lovely) months ago and I chose to get the picture. Very glad, everything went well and was a great experience.
