u-SvRRAfYgpbXZRfQgcTzA Happily visited again and I still love them. Tuna tataki is extremely delicious. So soft and tender, and the sauce complements the tuna very well. Mutely flavourful.

Takowasa is still my favourite dish from Imadake. I've had takowasa in other restaurants but not nearly as delicious as here! And only $5!! It is tiny but worth it. Their ratio of wasabi and octopus sashimi is perfect.

I don't order takoyaki anymore because I concluded that North America cannot make delicious takoyaki. But they do make decent takoyaki here! Not perfect but they're quite alright.

Desserts are absolutely delicious.

I find the price for the food is 100% + 100% worth the value. Actually the prices are cheap for such good food! Ramen is only $13??? And it's surprisingly a big bowl! The bowl looks shallow but it's hallow all the way to the bottom with LOTS of noodles. 

Spicy ramen is like clear broth + spice. I didn't love the rare beef in the beef ramen, but the pork belly in my spicy ramen is soooooooo delicious. The first ramen on the menu (Imadake ramen) is the best.

Service is A+++++++!!!!

Sake bombs can become quite loud with the chanting and hammering of tables. The restaurant is vivid with energy all night long!

Side note, I wholeheartedly agree with Jason M that the food does not compare to Guu. Yes indeed Imadake is for the sake bombs and the late night snacking!!
