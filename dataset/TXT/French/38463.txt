JJ1Ruu37kn66YSWUmCKNCw The food is fine.  The customer service is horrendous.  We drove 6 hours from NY.  We walked 30 min from St. Catherine.  My wife hardly ate half of her meal.  My son did not touch his.  The manager asked us if we wanted our food "to go."  We said "yes."  The manager threw out our food which he said "My mistake.  It happens."

Lawrence, the manager showed no remorse to replace my wife's meal.  Are all Quebec businesses like this? This would never happen in America.

Horrendous customer experience.
