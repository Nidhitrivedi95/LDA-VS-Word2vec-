kKC7UTcHZM3zLfT97x3msg OMG!  This place is the bomb.  We literally ordered almost everything on the menu and we were totally blown away.  My husband is a CIA trained chef who travelled France and Europe's sidewalk cafes for 6 summers while in school and I admit I am totally spoiled.  Why eat out when this guy is at home cooking?!?!  Frank's is such a beautiful treat!  Food was absolutely gorgeous:  whipped homemade goat cheese salad with cherry tomato confit = heaven!!  Amuse Bouche of butternut squash with truffle creme fraiche and pumpkin seed crackle in dishes the chef made.  Are you kidding me??  The food is absolutely top notch luscious.  Service and detail seals the deal.  5 stars aren't enough.
