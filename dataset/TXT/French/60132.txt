sARavfidmIS878q5BtlyVQ Every single dish was in all dimensions phenomenal.  

A true Jose Andres experience...there is so much more to each dish than the food presented.  Every flavor, essence, texture has a purpose and a story.   

I loved that it wasn't a snooty experience.  The chefs were interactive and the atmosphere was very relaxed and fun.  Sure, it's a pricey affair...but when you realize how much time and effort goes into every dish, it's a great deal.   There's not one thing that goes into your mouth that makes you go..."oh this tastes just like..."  Everything is unique and brings you to a new place...that makes your eyes roll to the back of your head...or smile...and even laugh.  Some dishes were so fun and delicious, I just laughed.  That may have been the wine flight, though.
