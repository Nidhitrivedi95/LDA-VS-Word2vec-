rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A With so many celeb chef outlets in Las Vegas, which try to mimic the original locations in high profile dining cities such as New York, San Francisco and London, many disappoint, however, Bouchon Las Vegas does not.  Not only is the Las Vegas location similar in style as the original in Yountville, the food is spot on as the dishes served at the Napa Valley location.

The foie gras is silky smooth once it reaches room temperature and while on my most recent visit, the "foie gold" as the layer of duck fat is referred to, was removed and whisked away, it can certainly be enjoyed on the never ending toasted bread that is made available for this delicacy.  While all the dishes I have tried at both the original location and the Las Vegas location are identical in taste, portion and presentation, I do find it amusing that the servers need to educate the Las Vegas crowd as to what certain items are, including certain spices and seasonings, including perhaps taking my "foie gold" away as they assumed that I was not educated enough to know what it was - this would never have happened at the original Yountville restaurant, as the Bay Area is foodie central.

Overall, a wonderful meal.
