2B46bRpDh49eDyjXGhL_ZQ I've been wanting to try this place since they open. I finally had a chance to go today with my boyfriend. I stumbled in around 5:20pm this after noon. 40 minutes before closing. I know they were probably annoyed but the lady was nice enough and told us it was okay if we dined in and enjoyed our crepes. 
I ordered the FLYER crepe And I added spinach and an egg to it. It was loaded and filling! The crepe batter itself was very plain and thin. It was just okay. I think I enjoyed the side salad (w/ their HM honey mustard dressing) that came along with it better than the actual crepe. 
My boyfriend ordered the Ham, egg and cheese crepe. The crepe was over cooked and the crepe batter was cracking. Not the typical French crepe I was expecting. 
I also ordered a hazelnut latte to go along with my meal, and also.... Nothing special. It wasn't sweetened and I had to add my own sugar. :/ I was quite disappointed.... Since this is suppose to be an authentic French creperie. But I will give it another try! Maybe next time I will try their sweet crepes instead! :)))
