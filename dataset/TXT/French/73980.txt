I came here for my best friend's birthday dinner with her family. They were able to accommodate the party of 13 we had. Each person was a little over $100. I liked how you could see the kitchen and see where all the magic happened. The lamb was superb! And the souffle is definitely worth it too, I liked how there were different kinds too: vanilla, chocolate,pistachio, and one other one. Definitely worth every bite and memory!
