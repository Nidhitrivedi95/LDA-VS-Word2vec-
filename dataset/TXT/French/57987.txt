rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I've had the honour of dining at Bouchon twice now, for brunch and for dinner service. In comparison to it's counterparts, Joel Robouchon and L'Atelier de Joël Robuchon, it falls significantly short. Service is still impecciable but Bouchon has definately lost it's cordial lustre for me. And here's why...

The heart of French pastry has stopped beating here. The assortment of pastries are lazy and heavy, made not in fluff or layers but the same as a common American bakery. I had to choke down most of it with my juice. The same stale and hard bread is served for brunch and dinner service.

Most menu items still hail French titles but oddly taste and feel like American dishes deconstructed to have hints of French. Strange, I honestly thought Bouchon was a French restaurant. 

If Thomas Keller is really known for his stellar dining experiences, I would bet that Bouchon isn't responsible for any of it.
