uP3H5bcsiTXM0k0xQhRndg What's not to love? The food, atmosphere, Silvia, and the entire Robin family! It was really a perfect meal. My husband and I decided to have a sampler. To start, we shared the Caesar salad (and let me tell you, this isn't your average Caesar salad - I'm talking chorizo, chipotle chicken, soft boiled egg), then the mac & cheese (it's divine - less cheesy and more creamy, it's hard to describe), and finally the gnocchi that had a Mexican twist. Sadly, we were far too full for dessert. Silvia was a complete sweetheart and we spent time talking about travel, baking, the future, etc. If you love intimate, family run restaurants...this is your spot!
