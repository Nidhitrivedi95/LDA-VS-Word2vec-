If you love carbs, you need to come to here.
I am not going to tell you anything that the hundreds of other reviews have not already stated.  Bottom line?  This place is GOOD!
Celebrating the b/f's birthday weekend and having already eaten way too much, we walked from our staycation hotel to the Venetian early Sunday morning to beat the brunch rush.  Arriving at precisely 7:52am, there was no wait. We thought they opened at 8:00am, but they are actually open at 7:00am on Saturday and Sunday.  
This was our first time here and we may not be coming back for a while since it's such an indulgence for us, so we decided to just go for it.  We began with the pastry basket, where you can order four different pastries.  We chose a croissant, pain au chocolat, raspberry beignets, and the lemon and currant scone.  BUT, before that, our fantastic waiter, Aaron, brought us some Epi bread and butter; let's get this carb party started!  There were crumbs all over the table, but there's no elegant way to eat flaky croissants, not to mention the other delightful pastries in the basket.
For the main course, I had the Croque Madame, a dish I'd only read about and seen pictures of until this point.  It did not disappoint, with the ham, the cheese, and the egg. I even ate some of the frites, something I try to avoid in real life now. The b/f had the chicken and waffles and that was also so tasty, a wonderful combination of flavors with syrup.  
The restaurant itself is decorated just like a French bistro that you could be in Paris, not Vegas.  The service was top-notch.  All I needed to make the experience complete was to hear "La Vie en Rose" playing on the music system.
