YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g don't know why this resturant's got such a good review for being a french and pricy resturant.  i was here for the sample menu and it was disasterous.  the plating was awful and taste was too salty.

of all 7 plates i had, only the salad and mussels were okay.  the others were just plain bad.  how can a french resturant serve hummus and nan?  i mean, really?  hummus and supermarket nan?  shrimp stir-fir noodles w/ dragon sauce?  at a french resturant?  i pay 7 bucks at a chinese take out and it is 1000+ plus better.  this restuarant should really consider hiring someone who knows to cook asian food other than overloading it w/ salt.  

hum...did i see spare-ribs or is that some brownish meat sticks?  absolutely no plating aesthetic.   just tasted like long frozen bones piling up.  can't believe such a pretentious.resturant dares to serve food up this way.
