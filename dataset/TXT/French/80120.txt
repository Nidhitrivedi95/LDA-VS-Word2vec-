zw4Legbcu018p5WcZ74iWA This is a CLASSIC St Laurent street eatery. Its tiny as tiny can get but its the food is the main criteria and it is amazing.

Ages ago i used to live in the neighbourhood and would eat here on a regular basis. I've been here so many times that i know instinctively how to order my food to go (which is the best option during the summer)

For me this place has the best fries in town. I prefer the stringy, crispy fries (oddly enough have not tried their poutine yet!)

The hamburgers is what i always get (unless i'm there for breakfast) and two burgers are always sufficient to hit the spot. Maybe its the crisp toastyness of the bun that adds to the taste. 

Note: If you suffer from claustrophobia, better get your friend to order for you. This place is tiny and on a busy evening.....
