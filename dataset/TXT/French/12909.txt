4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I came here for breakfast with family.  The location is stellar.  If you get a table outside you overlook the Bellagio fountains.  I had the bananas foster waffles for breakfast.  I was expecting a waffle but got 5 or 6 little tiny waffles.  They were a little too crispy for me.  I would order something  different if I went back again.  The orange juice was amazing - would have liked to have been offered a 2nd glass but I wasn't.  Oh well.  Would recommend for the view if you can sit outside but I wouldn't go out of my way to return here without being told "this is where we're having breakfast" by the people I was travelling with.
