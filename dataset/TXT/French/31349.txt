gh6__q2WXFuyN8gt6VAnWw Wasn't expecting much. Just late night grubs. Felt welcomed by the bartender. What was supposed to be a meal to go turned into a night pretty good meal with new beers, frog legs, and seafood pasta. The atmosphere was dark and pleasant. I felt disconnected from the usual Vegas bars and bar food. So glad this place is down the street and open until 12. I'm sure a happy hour couldn't hurt and promoting. I'll try dancing next time
