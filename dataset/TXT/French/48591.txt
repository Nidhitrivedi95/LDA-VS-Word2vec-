ohMpNug5zWNxOlL6ShG7Ig Sitting here on this rainy day, my mind keeps drifting to those lazy afternoons spent at Cafe Bink, sitting on the sunny patio, enjoying the best fries I have EVER tasted, ANYWHERE.  That's a pretty bold statement as I've eaten a LOT of fries :) and these fries live up to it.  They're made with care, the Belgian way, as was proudly explained to us by our server, (they're blanched, then twice fried.)  Served Parisian style, cradled in a cute paper cone, they come with three different sauces, for your dipping pleasure.  Of the three, my hands down favorite was the truffle ketchup.  This stuff is good, people.  Ooooh yeah!  Foodgasm good.  I mean, it'd bring you to your knees if you weren't already seated.  There was also an herbed mayo (dill was the prominent flavor) and a light aioli.  Both tasty as well.  No matter what entree you order, be sure to get their famous fries.

Their bacon wrapped meatloaf is another winner.  The bolognese sauce was heavenly.  And I have to mention their roast beef sandwich, which was seriously incredible, one to write home about.  (Yes, folks, I'm excited about a roast beef sandwich, lol.)

With it's consistently good service, charming, casual atmosphere and great quality food at surprisingly affordable prices, I much prefer Bink to it's high end and rather pretentious big sister restaurant, Binkley's.  Next time you're in the area, be sure to give Cafe Bink a try.
