VwZhwflLnTq19aAeFLJHCQ Great neighborhood spot! They have a great wine selection and outdoor seating as well.  Their French onion soup and their bread n butter are perfection!  The other menu items I have tried, mainly salads and sandwiches have also been great. I really like that this restaurant would be a good fit for many different occasions - Lunch or brunch with family or friends or significant other, wine date, romantic dinner, etc. I also love that they have been very accommodating when bringing my little guy. Will definitely be back.
