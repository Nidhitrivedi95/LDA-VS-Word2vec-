SpkwuDQChxHlNwfnx7OWUA Poutine is one of my fave foods. Unfortunately I cannot go as often as of like because the do not have a wheelchair ramp, and it is really hard trying to get a stroller up 3 stairs and hold the doors open. 

The poutines are good, the prices for the amount isn't the best, but it fills you up. Staff is friendly, good, sometimes a little loud music plays. 
Along with the poutines they sell fresh baked treats. That just thinking of them makes my mouth water.
