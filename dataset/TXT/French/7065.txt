4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Came here during Christmas week to have lunch after seeing all the wonderful reviews.  The place is very big with a dark interior, but there's a nice bright pavilion, and a nice outdoor patio as well.  The outdoor seating was all taken, so we opted to sit in the pavilion.  The service was OK, not the friendliest, but not too bad either.

As for the food... well, that's where it all went down hill.
For my kids, we received two sad looking kids meals served on what looked like a frozen TV food tray.  For one of the meals, my son ordered grilled cheese sandwich.  When it first came out, the bottom was burnt (black)!  I don't know how anyone would serve such a thing!  Perhaps they thought kids wouldn't know any better, or that no one would see the burnt side?  I sent it back right away and got a much better one afterwards, but no apologies what so ever.  

Since this is a french bistro, we figured we couldn't go wrong with the more French items.  My son wanted to try escargot, so we ordered the escargots de bougogne.  Having had this a few times in France and in Montreal, Canada, this was a disappointment.  $11.95 for pieces so small, I could barely taste it (see the picture of the dish untouched, you can barely see some of them) .  My son thought he was eating mushrooms.  I had the classic quiche lorraine and it was also a total let down.  Very salty, no bacon to be seen or tasted, only a couple strips of onions.  I make quiche much better than this!  Hubby had a warm chicken and brie sandwich he said was good, but the fries were soggy.  

Perhaps this place is better known for steaks, I don't know.  But after the meal we had, I would not return to this place.  There's so many other places to eat in Vegas that's much better!
