Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA I thought this place was sort of a rip off.  We were approached by someone outside the entrance about 'free cover' even though there was no cover to pay.  It was all kinds of creepy.

The Foursquare page for this bar says that there are drink specials for people who check in (and the specials are listed on the page).  When I approached the bar tender and showed him my phone, he was a big dick about the special and said it wasn't real.  He was angry at me and said that they weren't in charge of that page (apparently someone hijaked it and was making things up?).  I wasn't really pleased with the guy's attitude and then he was a dick to my group for the rest of the night.

Service is super, super slow (especially if you're outside) so don't bother staying here for a few drinks.  By the time you're done with your first one, you'll be so bored that you want to leave and go somewhere else for more drinks.

The drinks are also obviously pretty expensive and they only have standard cocktails (nothing unique or new).  Beer is insanely expensive and my Coors wasn't even cold when they brought it out.

The only good thing about this place is the view, which is pretty stunning of the strip.
