cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg This place has been a Montreal classic and I was excited to try it. But I guess I was being an ignorant American and thought I could come for dinner on a Thursday (around 6pm) without a reservation. I was greeted at the entrance by a hostess that was less than happy that I did not speak French then looked as if I insulted her when I apologized I did not have reservation. Eventually our party was seated at the bar but we were told we would have to leave within 1.5 hrs. Ok, that's fine. I was actually happy to get a table at the bar which was right in front of the kitchen so we got to see everything being made, that was the best part of this experience. Server was also very nice as well and was not at all rude like the hostess. 

We ordered some foie gras dishes, boudin, and a pied de cochon, the first few bites were delicious but as you continued, it tasted all very one note. Everything tasted like onions and butter, nothing wrong with that just hard to eat an entire plate of it. Although we didn't order it, the pig's head for two looked amazing (an entire pig's head with two knives sticking out of it sitting on a bed of mashed potatoes) and could probably feed 4 people. Was glad I came since it is such an institution, but would not want to come back.
