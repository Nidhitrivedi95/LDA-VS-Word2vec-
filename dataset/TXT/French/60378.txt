SBnpT6JDbah-5l_52GM5sw Sardine is a unique place. Maybe it's the decor or the ambience, I don't know? I do however love the food here. The frites have always been good, they have a good selection of beers. The Mussels are a real hit here. Their is two places in Madison with great Mussels, Bonfyre and Sardine. I've had other menu items here, I don't recall the name of a sandwich that I had here but it was phenomenal. I've also had the Duck à l'Orange and it was hands down one of the best meals I've ever had. Sardine is a great place for a special occasion. Parking is easy and your right by the lake for a nice stroll after dinner.
