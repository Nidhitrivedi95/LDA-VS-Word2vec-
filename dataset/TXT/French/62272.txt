SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ Amazing romantic atmosphere as you sit under the stars, beneath the trees with your love. This is a great spot to eat outside and there's plenty of room. 

We went for the Valentine's Dinner menu and it was absolutely perfect. We started off with drinks and my favorite was the toasted. It had caramel whiskey, Frangelico, banana liquor, cream and cinnamon! Such a refreshing and sweet drink to start off the night. We split most of the courses except our entrees. 

The lobster bisque was amazing especially with the mix of chorizo oil. The Gnocchi had an amazing blend of flavors and the presentation was beautiful. The best thing was the Bourbon Peach glazed prime rib. Seriously, I took some home so I could enjoy it one more day. We finished off with the Dark chocolate cake that had earl grey whipped cram and berry compote. The delectable garnish on top was beautiful and helped to wrap up the whole meal.

My suggestion is to go during their special events since they have different items on the menu. I still dream about that prime rib, the best I ever had! I wish it was always on the menu.
