ovtlrcsVRlgZZQUlHs_ovw It was my very first time at Vogue Bistro.  What a bad experience.  Since when does it take 3o mins for a drink and 2 hours to get you meal.  Not once did the server check on us or apologize for delay in service. 2 hours we waited for our dinner last night!  I was really embarrassed to being my friends to Vogue Bistro.  The service was horrible and the staff was extremely rude.   Will never go back!
