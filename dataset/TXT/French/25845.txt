Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA This review is based on the lounge.

We came here on a Thursday night, was amazed by the view, heads poppin' and body groovin to the DJ set, enjoying our &7.50+ beers-$16 mixed drinks when we see this guy with a mohawk started break dancing in the middle of the dance floor.

OK cool, someone's trying to warm up the dance floor and entertaining those two ladies that needed dance partners.  Next thing I know, the same mohawk guy keeps on trying to break dance.  It's like WHAT THE HECK??!!  A song or two to break dance is OK but from what I saw, a lot of people moved off the floor and some started leaving.  Did I mention this guy was also wearing T-shirt and Tennis shoes?  C'Mon.  For a place that's inside THE HOTEL by Mandalay Bay, you would've thought that they have standards there.

When I go to Vegas clubs, ESPECIALLY on the strip, I expect for everyone to be dressed up or casually dressed up nicely and dancing the way they should!  You would think that they set a certain ambiance with all the soft lighting, view and the service but I guess not.  I understand that you can pay off certain guys to let you go in if you're not up to the dress code but someone needed to step in and ask the guy to chill.

One good thing I liked about this lounge is that you actually have table/chairs that you can sit on and enjoy your company and it's by the DJ booth.  Thank goodness that we didn't have to pay for to get in but still....If they want people to start dancing, they need to hire party girls to interact with the customers and pump the crowd =)
