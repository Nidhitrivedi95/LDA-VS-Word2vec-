O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q I would first like to address my server Esteve Sabbah and server assistant Michael Lucas, along with manager Kevin Hinderliter if it was not for these 3 Gentleman's downright awesome hospitality my family and I would not have returned for round two tonight.

I had the steak on both of my visits which was a bone in rib eye 20 oz cut of Iowa corn fed beef aged for 28 days cooked medium... EXCELLENT!  My wife the first night had filet mignon 8 oz... EXCELLENT!  Tonight my wife had linguini clam... EXCELLENT!  Our 6 year old Stanley shared with us off of our plates and from the sides.  We ordered sides which were all popping with flavor...EXCELLENT!  Sides of the 2 days were sautéed seasonal mushrooms, steamed asparagus, sautéed green beans in butter, onion rings, and my favorite sautéed broccolini...

To be honest with you I really enjoyed how our sever Esteve Sabbah made the Caesar salad dressing in front of us at the table.  The dressing was made from scratch with several ingredients that we had direct input of quantity during the salad dressing making.   This was just EXCELLENT!... 

I will not even try to attempt to explain the robust tastes coming from after meal desserts.  The desserts that we had were just amazing in taste and presentation...EXCELLENT!  I am in a full food coma.

I travel all around and get to eat out several places per year around the United States and I will say without hesitation that this French Steakhouse & Bistro made number one position for my own 2014 dining experiences, hands down.

Much thanks again for their professionalism, personal touch with entertaining my son Stanley, and all around dining experience to my server Esteve Sabbah and assistant Michael Lucas.  We will return again.  Do yourself a favor and request this team they are on top of it!  Happy Holidays guys see you again, The Cook Family.
