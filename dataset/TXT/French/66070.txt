udFcIcbWbxrO8uLF95WnQg So my review is based mainly on the excellent staff... I came to the restaurant for the first time for a drug rep dinner for my work.  The food was excellent (salmon, med salad), but it was a set menu so I'll have to explore more options next time I come around.  More importantly in my opinion is that one of my colleagues had a completely flat tire when she rolled up to the valet service.  The valet service knew we were part of this drug rep group, found out who owned the car with the flat tired and offered to change the tire.  She actually had a malfunctioning trunk and they were still able to get in and change her tire.  Then the server came by to notify her that the spare wasn't properly inflated and she needed to get air before attempting to drive home on the highway.  They were so helpful and truly concerned that she had a safe ride home.  Very impressed by the staff and planning on coming back on my own accord in the future.
