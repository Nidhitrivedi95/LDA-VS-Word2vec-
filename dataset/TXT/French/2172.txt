0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g One of the best restaurants that I have been to in Vegas.  I haven't been here in a year or so but a couple dishes still stand out in my mind. They had this poached oyster dish  and seafood sausage thing that was just out of this world.   I'm salivating just thinking about it. 

Be prepared to spend a little cash but it is so worth it. You pay for the view of the Picasso's inside as well as the view of the fountains outside. Once you finish dinner, you can always have a seat on their patio and enjoy a few more fountain shows.
