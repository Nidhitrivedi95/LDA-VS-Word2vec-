IYreMhkT6e02tsbw-Dex5Q I have read countless reviews on Yelp and used it for restaurants in Pittsburgh, all over the country and overseas. This is the first review that I have ever written. I love a great steak and have had them in many famous steakhouses across the country and also in every steakhouse in Pittsburgh. We are spoiled in Pittsburgh to have many exceptional restaurants. However, none can match the steak I enjoyed at Bruneaux last night. I ordered the Tomahawk (32 oz.-bone-on) last night. It is, without question, one of the best steaks that I have ever had!  Certainly the best in Pittsburgh , and that's no knock on Pittsburgh's steakhouses. It was cooked to perfection. It was not charred on the outside but done to perfection (medium) all the way through. It was incredibly juicy and tender, but the flavor was just incredible. If you want a steak in the Pittsburgh area, I highly recommend Bruneaux. I assume the other cuts are equally delicious. P.S my wife's chicken was outstanding as well.
