SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ I was in Phoenix last week for a shoot, and my photographer recommended House of Tricks to me, describing it as the only really upscale restaurant in the Tempe Mill Avenue District.

I wanted to order something pretty light because I had what I thought was food poisoning earlier that morning (it was diagnosed the following day as the stomach flu). I ordered one of the few vegetarian options - pumpkin goat cheese ravioli - and I have to say that I enjoyed it a lot more than I thought I would. I usually scoff at pasta entrees that cost more than $15 (this cost $22), but hey, I was on business and not footing the bill. All of the flavors worked together beautifully... the nutty pistachio-spinach pesto, the sweet blood orange balsamic, and the subtle sage creme fraiche. There was some sauteed kale underneath the ravioli; it was the perfect veggie complement to the dish. This was one of the more memorable pasta dishes I've had. 

If you sit outside, the candlelight is really, really weak. Be prepared to read your menu with the light from your smartphone screen.

I really liked my ravioli... until my stomach flu reared its ugly head a few hours later, making me run to the closest available toilet for the next 10 hours. The ravioli coming up wasn't as good as it was going down. But if I'm ever in Phoenix again with a stronger stomach, I definitely plan on returning to try some of their meat dishes!
