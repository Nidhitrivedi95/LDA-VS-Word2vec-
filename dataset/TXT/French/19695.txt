aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw On chocolate chunk cookie & red velvet cupcake only! I think they have the BEST chocolate chunk cookie EVER! Seriously, I could only eat half of one and then amazingly has the other half the next day, which I wouldn't really do, it was STILL CHEWY and OUT OF THIS WORLD! Sweet explosion in my mouth.... gotta love it!

A lot of other things look delectable too, though these two just hit the spot on this day!
