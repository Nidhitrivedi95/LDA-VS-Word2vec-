_eNeiqWPt1MPLFF6DEIJeA I felt like eating light so I decided on the Ebi steam bun and the Moo Shu Duck from the small plate menu. The steam bun was perfect as were the accompanying vegetables. 
The server was most helpful by taking the initiative and bringing some hoisin sauce though it was not on the menu for my moo shu duck. It was perfect.The scallion pancakes made the perfect vehicle for the awesome combination of duck, kimchee, cashew/sesame crumble, and hoisin.
I believe this is a must try.
