-ClafaRWkSRTfieIzO4r3Q Firstly I have no idea how a restaurant named Roux doesn't appear to use Roux to construct its Gumbo. They could, in fact, but if so it's so uncharacteristically thin, I would not call it Gumbo.

In addition to a very material amount of the volume of the Gumbo consisting of inedible bone, it was one of the blandest soups I've had in my life and I'm including Campbell soup cans. I did not grow up pampered, so I'm not fancy. But oh, boy. The Gumbo I made on my first attempt was at least 3X better. I truly didn't want to finish it, but I had no other food in the house and had little food all day.

The collard greens were again bland and over-salted and under-cooked.

Roux killed the baby Jesus.

0 Stars for food, but 3 stars for very friendly, lively, attentive and competent staff. Not sure about the other reviews but the people I talked to on my delivery order were a pleasure to talk to.
