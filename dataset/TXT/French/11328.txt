4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw We spent our anniversary there sitting outside watching the spectacular water show synchronized with great music!

Service was friendly and prompt.

Escargot and frisée salad with poached egg and freshly baked hot baguette were delicious.

My steak classique was. Perfectly cooked medium rare.The fries were a touch too crispy for my taste as they were hard to eat.

My husband had the steak bordelaise and found the sautéed onions a bit too on the sweet side.

All in all it was very nice .The price was not too bad for Vegas and we would definitely return.
