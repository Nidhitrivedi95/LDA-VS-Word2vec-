j0baDQfMAGDm_QGdFMmb-Q We are fortunate to live just a couple moments away, but now that I have experienced it I would gladly drive across town for the food. My wife and I stopped in on a Saturday afternoon for a glass of wine and we hoped some small bites of appetizers. The kitchen hadn't opened yet but we decided to enjoy our wine at the bar and learn about the place. After a few moments, there are some wonderful olives that the chef brought out to us.  We asked for some bread and then the owner sat at a chair and we had a wonderful hour. We made reservations to come back on Monday night for dinner.  We are so glad that we did.  The salad was superb.  My wife got the mussels in an excellent wine sauce. The garlic butter for the bread was just as appealing as it had been on Saturday.  I ordered Steak Poivre, one of my favorites and truly one of the tenderest and most flavorful steaks I have eaten.  My wife had the rack of lamb.  Charred perfectly, tender and the bite she was willing to share with me was incredible.  I agree with one of the earlier reviewers, you may be lucky to get a reservation in this place in three months.  Go now.
