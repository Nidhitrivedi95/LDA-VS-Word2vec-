fVF5wayDyY6ZR5oJB1IK3g I had high expectations for Lawrence. Went for lunch with a friend the other day. I was well received by the waitstaff upon arrival (it was still very quiet). My meeting was running late so I ended up waiting for 15 minutes. I had spent a few minutes looking at the wine list when I got there. 10 minutes later, the waitress had not look led at me once or come to offer me a drink. Had to signal her (there were 2 waitresses and a busboy for approximately 12 customers at this point) to come take my drink order. 

I didn't feel too adventurous and most menu items did not speak to me so I ordered the burger. I asked for it medium (waitress said they typically serve it mid-rare) as I expected a high quality meat. It was really nothing special at all, and tasted and had the texture of very basic, lean ground beef. Definitely not ground filet and the seasoning was lacking for a restaurant of this quality. I don't even know if they put salt and pepper in their mix. It is served with a sliced tomato, lettuce, mayo and Dijon (how original)...Lawrence needs to up their burger game. 

My friend had a bass dish that was very well presented and he enjoyed. 

I have to give this place another shot but for a $70 lunch for two (main and glass of wine each), I expect better service and some differentiation in a common dish such as a burger.
