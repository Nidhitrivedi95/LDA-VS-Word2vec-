rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Loved Bouchon. It has a wonderful french brasserie atmosphere. The french margaritas were really good too! 
The waiter also knew a lot about the extensive wine collection. There are two french wines I'm in love with now. 
The food was delicious. We had pork belly for an appetizer and lamb for dinner. Y. U.M. I definitely recommend trying this restaurant!
