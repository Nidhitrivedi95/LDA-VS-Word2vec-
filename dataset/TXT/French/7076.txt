4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Yay me for being review #4000 (I think)!

Anyways, my sister, brother-in-law, and I stopped by Mon Ami for a late dinner around 10. Worst part about Vegas is that if it's open, it's busy. The hostess originally told us that they were not accepting walk-ins until 11 but my sister was clever enough to make a reservation through Yelp for 10:30.

After losing money at the slot machines, we were seated promptly. Our server was a bit awkward but extremely helpful and courteous. We ordered 2 hanger steaks, 1 mac & cheese, and a kale salad. The hanger steaks were exquisite. They were super tender and the fries were super thin and crispy albeit over salted. The kale salad was okay. Nothing special. The macaroni and cheese was pretty good too though but I believe technically it would be shells and cheese. 

We also shared a carafe of "frangria" and it was good but I would've preferred regular sangria. It was almost too light and juicy. It was almost like watered down wine. 

Overall the dinner was good but pricy. I would come back since everything in Vegas is expensive but at the same time it seems more popular than it deserves.
