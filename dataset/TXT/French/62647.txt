SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ We had an 11:00 am reservation and we arrived a few minutes early, along with a number of folks including an elderly woman. 

The Hostess working Saturday morning had a rotten disposition and although it was 10:57 refused to seat anyone until exactly 11:00 while she stood behind her podium doing nothing. That was strike one. 

The restaurant has a fountain with two koi fish floating in barely 6 inches of water. Strike two. 

Although our waitress was great, the food, while decent, wasn't fantastic. It was ok. 

We won't be returning, mainly because of the scowling hostess.
