hvjgF-vnPw2jyL5DBuB0qg I don't think the right words exist for me to describe this place. If anything it was more of a feeling and an experience than just a dinner.

We walked in at 6:30 for a 7pm reservation and the very friendly host sat us down right away at a perfectly cozy booth.

The menu changes frequently so they don't actually hand out menus, instead they are written in both french and english on chalkboards around the restaurant. There is an option of about 7-8 appetizers and 7-8 mains, all of which are explained by the extremely friendly and pleasant wait staff. Everything on the menus looked appetizing so it was hard to choose but you really couldn't go wrong. Prices range from about $15 appetizers to $36 mains.

We ordered the traditional Lobster Poutine to start which was perfect and there was not even one bite left. My friend and I ordered the scallops and gnocchi as well as the stuffed quail with creamed kale to split. Again, there was nothing left on the plate and every bite was better than the last. For dessert we opted for the fried mars bar with ice cream on the side. It was interesting because its such a simple concept but it complemented the feel of the restaurant and comfort food of the menu. 

I believe we stayed for 2.5 hours. I don't think we really wanted to leave

On top of that, the night we were there Chuck Hughes himself happened to be filming a shucking oysters segment for his show so we were lucky enough to spend some time chatting with him and getting a photo op. He was beyond friendly and made our time there that much more enjoyable. I will definitely be making my way back there or to his other restaurant during my next trip to Montreal!
