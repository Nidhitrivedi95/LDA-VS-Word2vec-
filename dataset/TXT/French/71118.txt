xcmmTXhuMx2fZF2Bt69F4w Having heard about this place for months, and after one failed attempt, I finally made it to Point Brugge Cafe for both dinner and brunch this past weekend.  The wait for dinner is as bad as everyone says.  My friend and I once experienced a 45 minute wait at 8:30 at night!  If going for dinner got early, I was promptly seated on the patio at 5:30.  For brunch, there was no wait at 2 PM.

For dinner, I opted for the mussels and fries since that is what seemed to be there most popular dish.  The mussels were cooked to perfection and the white wine broth was good enough to eat with a spoon.  The fries were very crispy and very good accompanied with the basil mayo.  While this dish was certainly good, it left me somewhat underwhelmed with a place I had heard nothing but good things about.  I would recommend ordering it as an appetizer, and selecting an entrée  too.

Brunch on the other hand was instantly outstanding.  The Liege waffles were by far the best waffles I've ever had.  No syrup was required given that the fruit topping of the day was bourbon glazed peaches.  I also highly recommend the potato strudel that had countless layers of potatoes and cheese.

The beer selection is excellent.  Both the Brigand tripel and Franziskaner weizen were great beers.

While my dinner visit left me to question whether or not I would return, brunch sealed the deal.  I will be coming back here often.
