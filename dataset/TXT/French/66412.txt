uP3H5bcsiTXM0k0xQhRndg Friendly family owned and operated restaurant.  The co-owner spent time to introduce her family and their restaurant's cuisine to mes amis et moi for a late evening dinner.  The cuisine was simply elegant with a flair for internationally influenced touches:  all freshly made with many locally grown ingredients.  We sampled the gnocchi with chipotle topping and the lentils with local saucisse de poulet (chicken sausage).  Ceux-ci étaient délicieux!
