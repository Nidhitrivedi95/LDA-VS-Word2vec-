cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg We got there around 10pm, and was asked to wait even for the bar  since the wooden dinning tables are crowded of all kinds of eaters. My eye opened big when I saw a full page of foie gras, foie gras burger, foie gras on a pizza ,foie gras terrain......  We chose Plogue à Champlain (Pancake, potatoes, foie gras, maple syrup, thick cut maple cured bacon)  and the very classic Seared foie gras with apple. We also tried Guinea Hen Liver Mousse and a pork dish which are OK. Maybe the foie gras dishes were so overwhelming.
