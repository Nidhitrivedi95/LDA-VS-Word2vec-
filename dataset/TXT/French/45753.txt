mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q I really think that this was the finest meal I've ever had in my life. We had the 5-course menu with wine pairing, and each course blew us away! 

The attention to the tiniest details (we saw the chef literally using tweezers to assemble the plates) to the quality of every ingredient was perfect. While it might be easy to think that this is just expensive frou frou food with too many bells and whistles and not enough food -- this was not the case here! Everything on the plate served a distinct and delicious purpose, and we both left full, satisfied, and with memories that will last a very long time. 

I recommend sitting at the "bar"/"counter," if I could even call it that. It was just really awesome to see the chefs at work, and the service was top notch! Not stuffy, pretentious, or rude. Just genuine, attentive, friendly, and so knowledgeable, which is what one would expect for this price tag.
