Le Comptoir is a charcuteries et vins bar, and it's very "happening".  It hold a promising title: "One of Canada's Best New Restaurants"

I was sadly underwhelmed, but that might have had to do with the mind-blowing meal (see le Quartier general) I had the night before.

Our dinner at Le Comptoir was still delicious, but I was neither blown away nor disappointed. I loved the vibe though. Laid back yet lively. 

The menu is a bit daunting, so I looked to the server for help.  When I asked him what his favourites were or if he could recommend something, he said, "I don't know, that's hard". I disagree.  To be passionate about food is to be secure enough to just say your opinion. There is never a wrong answer.  No answer means indifference.

My sister and I decided on the tuna.  It was beautifully plated and had a lot of potential.  It was such a perfect piece of fish but I wanted the dish to shine, it just flickered.

The short ribs were spectacular.  As for the charcuterie, it was fine.  But if you had Black Hoof's board in one corner, and Le Comptoir's in the other; the latter would be DOA.
