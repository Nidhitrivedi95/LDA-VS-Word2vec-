eJ9L40jm5VOXCIq7xs9kQw I came here for Christmas Eve dinner and it was absolutely wonderful from start to finish. I was seated at a table by the window, which was on  a lovely narrow cobbled lane. I started with the salad, which was lovely and dressed perfectly. Then came the salmon tartare, delicious.  Next was an intermezzo (palate cleansing sorbet). My entree was barramundi, which may one of the best fish dishes I have ever eaten in my life; simply prepared, but bursting with fresh flavor. I would have licked my plate clean if I didn't hope to return there someday. For dessert I chose a creme caramel, which was the only part of the meal which, while fine, did not wow me.  My glass of pinot grigio was pretty good and only $7, very reasonable for a restaurant of that caliber. Service was perfectly balanced between attentiveness and allowing me to dine in peace and eat a my leisurely pace.
I absolutely intend to go back when I visit Montreal again.
c;est magnifique!
