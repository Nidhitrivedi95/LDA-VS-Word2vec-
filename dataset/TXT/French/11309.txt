4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw One of my good friends recommended this place before I left for Vegas.  I'm glad I've went there.  To get the outside patio there was a hour wait.  We said that's ok, we can sit inside, so we were seated right away.  They walked us all the way close to the patio where the cover was.  That was pretty good too.  We were surprised that we got to sit there.  You don't get the outside breeze that day and you get all the natural sun light.  GF had the salad and the soup of the day.  I had the escargot and sliced duck sandwich special.  Soup of the day wasn't great, but my escargot and sandwich was great.  Service again was good too.  If you can get there early to outside seating during the summer, you should do it.  That day was pretty windy, so we made the right choice by sitting inside.
