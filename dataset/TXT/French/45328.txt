mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q Towards the end of our meal, my wife turned to me and exclaimed, "This is the best meal I've ever had!" I'm not sure if I agree, but it was definitely the most expensive meal I've ever had! Overall, it was an excellent and thoroughly enjoyable meal.

I started off the meal with Le Hamachi, which was uni wrapped in hamachi sashimi - as both a hamachi and uni fan, this was just fantastic. That was followed with Les Legumes, which was a pleasant salad (I was expecting more legume type vegetables, but these were mostly leafy greens and tomato). I also enjoyed a deviled egg with crab, and a creamy pasta dish with uni. Perhaps the highlight of the meal was La Sole, which was a whole Dover sole fish cooked on the Japanese teppanyaki grill with a butter meuniere sauce. The sole was much larger than all other dishes and was absolutely delicious.

The service was very friendly and attentive, and we enjoyed sitting at the bar. Very expensive, but well worth it!
