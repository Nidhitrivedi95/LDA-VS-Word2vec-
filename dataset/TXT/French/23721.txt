cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg Came here with my wife to celebrate our 1 year Anniversary. 

Mistake! We waited 20 minutes past our 8pm reservation-okay fine it's Saturday night... we get seated we get water and our menus right away. 

We order a bottle of wine, food is ordered ... an HOUR later our appetizer arrives- tastes good... 20 minutes after that my pasta arrives and my wife's duck in a can comes(well done), manager comes agrees it's over done 5 minutes later new duck in a can comes, too raw Really at a place this well rated? They sear it more and bring it back. They comp her a glass of wine. We eat our meal but it's nothing spectacular. We politely refuse the dessert menu at this point we don't want to be there, they bring the check and tell us the glass of wine is complimentary-Really that's it? Wouldn't offer anything else. $200 (not well spent) and 3 hours later, please go elsewhere.
