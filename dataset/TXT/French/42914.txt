LnSjzFXh1GrOObsRP6LhBQ It's my fourth time here, at this delightful little cafe, this week. I like coming in to hear the happy baristas conversing in French and sometimes humming along to the French Satellite radio. The pastries and sandwiches are all made fresh daily and are very tasty. Service is always friendly and fast. I will keep coming back!
