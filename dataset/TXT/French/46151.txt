myJ6pgIhN42EQh2sAVXKoQ This was my first time at Toma. Stopped in for a quick bite last night. Overall, good experience. 

Service: Fast, friendly/welcoming.

Food: I ate the Old School burger and a side of the classic mac n cheese. The burger, although delicious, was very hot. I burnt my tongue. The mac n cheese, on the other hand, wasn't as hot as I expected. The buns Toma bakes in-house are fantastic! Bun to patty ratio was great, but I felt like I wanted more toppings on the burger. You can order additional toppings, but it didn't sound like it was something Toma usually does. Burgers come as is. 

Atmosphere: Clean, inviting. Comfortable booth seating. Had much more of a 'sit and stay' vibe than you usually get at a burger joint. Although nice, I felt like this was a miss considering the overall simplicity of the branding, and the menu.  

Price: Great value for what you get. 

Ps. They deliver! And have an Instagram account too. I appreciate a restaurant that embraces its customers outside of its normal channel of interaction and isn't afraid to show off its food.
