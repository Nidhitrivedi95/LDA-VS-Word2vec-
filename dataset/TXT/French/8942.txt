4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I made a reservation at 6:30pm in advance, so was seated right away. The server helped me order for 4 people instead of 5 because my grandma and mom weren't that hungry. I asked to order Frisee, Kale & Warm Bacon Salad, Wild Escargots de Bourgogne, two Onion Soups Au Gratin, Classique steak and Chilled Seafood Platter. However, the server recommened one more entree, Grilled Pork Tenderloin because their portions are not enough. I also remember I wasn't satisfied with the portion last time. The foods were great, but a little bit salty. Also, I brought my family including 83 year old grandma here and she said she couldn't see what she was eating because it was too dark inside for her. I should've asked to sit outside instead for her. 

Since I haven't explorer French dishes much yet, I will come back and try other foods if I'm coming back to Vegas in near future.
