HcfwrlljJpfLh71znq47zw OK this was one of the best places in Scotland we had in our tripl The artichoke soup was rich creamy with flavors of truffles and a great dish.  We had the tasting course and found it a pretty decent tastng menu.  There were about 2 stand out dishes like the soup and the rest were about a 7-8 which in our personal 1-10 rating is pretty respectable.  I would give this place about a 8 to 8.5 out of ten.  It was a solid performer but not yet at a French Laundry level but worth a visit if you are traveling to Scotland or for a special occasion.
