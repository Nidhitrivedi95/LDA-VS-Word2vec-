6x3zxKZ9GAu1HGH3fDbYyA The Corner House is my former go-to lunch break destination when I'm biking through the country-side North of Toronto. Their morning/early afternoon menu is exclusively brunch. It's relatively small at about 5 breakfast and 5 lunch items. It's also pricey; it really makes me feel like I haven't left the City. I usually get the $18 Prime Rib sandwich, we is excellent. It's tender, juicy, and cover in delicious Au Jos but not so much that you can't eat with your hands (and maintain your dignity). The mushrooms and bun are very fresh and really make the sandwich.

The food is excellent, but the main reason I'm only giving The Corner House three stars is the decline in service quality. The first time I went here in April, I pulled up on my bike the owner greeted me, and immediately brought me a giant pitcher of water. The service was prompt; they understood that I wasn't interested in lounging on the patio all afternoon. My list visit there about a week ago was a sharp change. I sat on the patio for several minutes before I gave up and went inside. There was a gentleman with his kids already waiting by the "Please wait to be seated" sign. He eventually gave up and left. I was a little more persistent and hunted down a waiter. The place wasn't packed; about 12 tables serviced by four people. Once I found the waiter, I took my seat on the patio and order the usual. When he came back to deliver my food, he dumped it on the table, mumbled "here" and took off back inside. I never saw him again; no return to check on my meal or refill my water. When I was done, I had hunt down a server inside again to retrieve my check. This was by far the worst service I've received at The Corner House, but the rest of the times it's been nothing special. And at these prices it should be!
