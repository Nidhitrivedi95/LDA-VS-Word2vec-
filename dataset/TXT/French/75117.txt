XZ7eQLjyGXf6y69UT4SGhg Fantastic French bakery.  My wife ate her way through Paris and said this food was just like it was there, a taste of Paris in Vegas.  The crossaint cinnamon rolls were delectable. And the vegetarienne gallette was savory and delicious.  The cafe mocha was not too sweet with a hint of chocolate the was not overbearing.  I highly recommend this place to anyone who wants the French bakery experience in the Nevada desert.
