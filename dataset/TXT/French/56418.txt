rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A i cry.  You walk in and you can tell it's a pretty fancy place.  Of course I went in flip flops. VEGAS BABYYYY. Anyways, perfect and elegant waiter.  We went for brunch and there was so many sweet and savory dishes to choose from!  We ordered the pastry basket and couldn't stop eating it!  The pastries were so rich in flavor and darn buttery!  My fiance got the croq monsieur sandwich and each bite was yolk heaven! I got the chicken and waffles and....not that good.  Maybe I should order french food at a french restaurant.  Service and view of the fountain made this meal so awesome!
