ZdaZwXC0FByDY3EwNELphw You should absolutely, 100% go here for brunch, lunch or dinner. Union plates and amazing array of dishes. Whether your in the mood for a traditional burger or steak tartare, Union has got you covered. 

This restaurant is a diamond among many other great restaurants along the Ossington strip, but the combination or service and food selection gives it a leg up. Be warned, many others are also aware of how great Union is, so you should expect to wait for a table.  

My personal recommendation for food would be the Swiss Train Ride - a combination of French ham, Swiss cheese, a fried egg, bechamel atop a bed of greens....drool!
