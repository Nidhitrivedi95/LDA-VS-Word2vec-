DlnMwCDIxQ-o5kNMAfOs1g Le Di Vin is fast becoming the most popular destination for wine lovers in Edinburgh. The surroundings are gorgeous, the bar is in a converted Polish church next to La P'tite Folie and looks spectacular with a high ceiling and cosy little mezzanine which can be hired for parties. The wine list is huge as you would expect and although there is a French theme it includes wine from around the world. I also appreciated that there is a wide range of prices (from c.£20 a bottle upwards). The food menu is very limited but tasty - they only offer various sandwiches and charcuterie/cheese boards which are great for sharing with friends. All the staff seem to be very friendly and knowledgeable about all the wine, meat and cheese they sell. This is a great bar with a good atmosphere - perfect for catching up with friends.
