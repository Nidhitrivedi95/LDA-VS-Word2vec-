myJ6pgIhN42EQh2sAVXKoQ I came back here not too long after burger week and yes, the burgers are still pretty great even if you don't smell them for an hour while you wait in line.

I will say this though, the Las Vegas Burger was quite tasty and all, but I wouldn't say the kobe beef was any meaningful upgrade from the angus patties.

Also, despite what I said about the fries in my original review...I still got an order to split with my date. It just felt weird not to have fries?

There was also a good deal on beer, so three pints ahoy.

I'm definitely a solid fan now, though I'd still like to see more creativity with the fries and the possibility of onion rings.
