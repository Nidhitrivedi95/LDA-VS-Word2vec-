YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g Was at Fleur this past weekend with a party of 9. Two sets of the FEAST tasting menu was ordered. No one was aware that it came with 43 dishes. So 43 X 2=86 was how many dishes we had. There was so much food that it was hard to enjoy all of it. The food was good, but 
nothing all too impressive. 
 
Dishes I enjoyed:
Parmesan paprika popcorn
p.e.i. mussels basil & parmesan emulsion
Skirt steak with chimichuri
Lobster Mac & Cheese
Garlic Fries
ceci frito fried chickpea, preserved lemon 
marinated olives 
Chicken Wings
Tiramisu
Creme brulee Trio
Pb& J chocolate macaroons with rum iced milk 

It was $160 per person...with a few alcoholic drinks

The service was excellent. The ambiance was classy and trendy.
