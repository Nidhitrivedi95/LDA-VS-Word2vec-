rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I didn't dislike this place, but it was exceedingly average, and definitely below par for a 'fancy Vegas restaurant' attached to a famous chef. 

Highlights: 
- some of the best oysters I've had in my life. We got 3 each of East and West coast oysters, and they were both delicious. 
- drinks were on point. I ordered a girly raspberry liquor-based drink which was fruity but not TOO sweet. Boyfriend said the Manhattans were impeccable. 

And that's it. The bone marrow was pretty good, but forgettable. Both of our main courses - steak and a salmon-based special - were not bad but extremely average. There are a bunch of lower maintenance and lower-priced restaurants in LA with better food than this. 

Overall, dead average. I wouldn't recommend this place to a friend (unless they wanted a meal of 100% oysters and nothing else), but I wouldn't wince in sympathy if I heard they'd gone here either.
