AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw Review for the Patisserie side:

Excellent authentic French pastries.  Enjoyed the mille-feuille (Napoleon)-spectacular!  I thought the pastry cream in it was perfect, but my husband felt it was a tad too sweet. Pastry portion flaky, delicate, and as delicious as could be!  Four stars rather than five for the following reasons: somewhat limited selection of pastries (though the term quality over quantity comes to mind...), we got ice cream as part of our treat and it was TERRIBLE (grainy and lacking in flavor), and for my husband's opinion regarding sweetness.  Would be helpful if Yelp split the Patisserie from the Bistro for ease of browsing reviews. 

Will definitely return to the Patisserie in the future!
