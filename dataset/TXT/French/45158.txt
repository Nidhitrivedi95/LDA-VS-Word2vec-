mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q Truly an outstanding place to eat a meal and so much fun too boot. Foodie heaven is what comes to mind when I think back on this dining experience. The counter service is the way to go so you can maximize your interaction with your waiter and the chefs working behind the counter. The small plates are perfect and I went with 4 of them. Each of the dishes was refined and outstanding. The portions are a perfect size.  Desert was perfect as well with the tart tray really blowing me away. Service was very good. The waiter was extremely professional and enhanced the experience. I loved the dark decor. The bill was pretty hefty but you only live once.  If you love food and part with $150+ for dinner then you must go here.
