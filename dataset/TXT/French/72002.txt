XI3iNUgChOfJk5ppjKVEQQ I came here because my friend recommended the paella here and I absolutely love paella. However, upon arriving here I feel as though we were treated pretty rudely. 

Originally, we arrived without a reservation and were asked to come back in another hour and a half. Totally understandable, not an issue, but when I asked if they needed my number to alert us that our table was ready, the hostess looked at me and said to me curtly, "No, your table will be ready at the time I already specified..." Fine, so we left to walk around and wait.

When we came back and were finally seated, they didn't give us our menus for 5 minutes. They seated a party of 3 and gave them menus even though they arrived after we did.

The paella itself was okay. Nothing too special that I would rave about to anybody else. The foie gras was this restaurants saving grace, really the only thing that I was impressed by.

To be honest, I probably wouldn't return or recommend this restaurant to my friends unfortunately.
