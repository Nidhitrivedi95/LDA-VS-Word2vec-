mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q It was an absolutely fantastic experience to dine here!  We chose a course to taste many different dishes and loved the most!  Noteworthy were foie gras dishes, and the parfait was just amazing with slightly sweet sauce in a delicate balance.  Mushed potato was to die for. 

The staff was the best; he was knowledgeable, pleasant, informative, attentive and knew exactly when to bring and remove dishes. Just amazing. 

Don't choose tarts for dessert.  They look fabulous but taste are not.  Other than that, indulge yourself.
