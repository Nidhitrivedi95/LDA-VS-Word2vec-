i came twice during my short trip to Montreal, so it was that delicious and satisfying.
both times i sat at the old school mirrored bar, where the servers were helpful and genuine. order from the seasonal menu, you can see the chefs' creativity and excitement to use seasonal produce in the thoughtful food.

-Nova Scotia oysters
-baby artichoke hearts, button mushrooms, fresh herbs- delicate, yet satisfying
-crispy duck confit with new potatoes, ground cherries, mushrooms, demi glace and frisee- wow, what a perfect dish. the kitchen is generous with wild mushrooms, and i loved seeing the short season ground cherries on the plate. demi glace is deeply flavored, seasoned perfectly.
-il flotante- so fun! but the portion was huge for one person. need to work on my French bistro lunch capacity.

second visit:
-squash soup with goat cheese and almonds- creamy, refreshing, highlighted the perfectly ripe and sweet summer squash
-beet salad- gorgeous mix of flavors, textures and temperatures. in such a simple guise. slivers of buttered mushrooms tucked under a crown of perfect baby red lettuce leaves, hunks of tender sunset colored beets as the foundation.
-fresh summer berries with buffalo milk yogurt and vanilla honey syrup- exactly what i wanted after seeing so many berries at the farmers' market. a generous bowl of summer, topped with micro basil, a lovely complement.
