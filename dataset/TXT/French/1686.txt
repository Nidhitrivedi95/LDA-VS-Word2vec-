0d6kx6Jlocw77y1J9nbqMA I've been to Scratch before, and I remember them as a quaint little neighborhood bakery... But a recent visit revealed notable changes. The dining room has been reorganized to accommodate more people, the decor slightly updated, and menu changed. None of these changes are bad, it just leads to a different experience.

A few things to mention: The old menu on the wall is outdated but they haven't painted over it yet. Service is a little disorganized. I wasn't sure who was waiting on my table, the first waitress was very inattentive and seemed to care little about the customers.  She never brought silverware, she never brought water, she never showed up again to check on us.  After she took our initial order, a second waitress had to come out 10 minutes later to confirm the order--needless to say, the food came out slow (about 40min after ordering).  Overall this recent experience was very poor. A shame, because I've been here in past and remember it fondly.  I guess they are suffering from a bit of growing pains.  The food is still very good.  Simple French dishes done well and the prices are fair. Lunch for two w/ drinks will run you about $25-35.  Hopefully they work out the kinks soon. I still plan to revisit and report my findings.
