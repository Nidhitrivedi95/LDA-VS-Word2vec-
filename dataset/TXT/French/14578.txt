Hung over and in need of some food. I had the croquette monsieur, while the really hung over guy next to me had the pino omlette. He enjoyed as much as his stomach could handle.

Really friendly staff, and the food was good.

Odd decor around you for breakfast, but hey its french, and its vegas, so there's bound to be something not right.
