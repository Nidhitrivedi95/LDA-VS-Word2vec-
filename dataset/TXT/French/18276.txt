A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g I love this place!  It's the real deal, so of course everything is delicious.  The quiches are great to take home or give as gifts!  I bought a pumpkin cheesecake for Thanksgiving that seemed ridiculously and uncharacteristically expensive at $36--until we tasted it.  OMG--worth every cent!
