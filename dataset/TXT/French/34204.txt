hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA I'm in LOVE! 

Today was my first visit to the Baguette Cafe, and it was perfection! I had the sublime Cream of Zucchini Soup which has to be one of THE BEST soups I've ever had! Next I had the Prosciutto and Salami sandwich on a croissant which I ate v-e-r-y slowly because it tasted so good I didn't want it to end...LOL. And to finish everything, I had the decadent melt-in-your-mouth Chocolate Tart for dessert. Did I mention the absolutely wonderful people behind the counter?? 

I'm excited for my next visit!
