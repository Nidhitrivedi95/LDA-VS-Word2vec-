aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw More like 3.5 due to pricing, its not the cheapest but pretty good!. Everyone comes here for the macarons which for someone who's never had a macaroon or 'ron before im not quite sure to compare it too but it was light, delicate and tasty! got the 5 'ron special or something like that so i could try all the flavors its too bad I cant really define what each one is although some are fairly simple to distinguish, the pink one is strawberry and yes it tastes like strawberry. Pistachio was good and i think the tan was caramel or coffee, but whatever it is, i did like it! What i thought was better than the macarons was the TKOs! I'm an oreo eater so this really made my day! it wasnt in the glass when i ordered so i asked the clerk and she said they just made some so i got a fresh batch! yum! real good, taste like a luxurious creamy oreo..what can i say, i like my oreos... all in all the TKO was a definite TKO!
