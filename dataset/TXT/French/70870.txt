xBxDMEkFK5GBhiy-8gGE9w Being on a budget Normand Laprise's flagship Toque is way outside my price range so I was excited when he opened up a more affordable restaurant.  Located in the Quartier des Spectacles this chic restaurant is an ideal place to visit if you're catching a show at Place des Arts.  It is small so a reservation is a good idea and an absolute must if something is going on at Place des Arts.

They have a small menu but they focus on doing things well.  I ordered the shrimp guedille which is sort of like a lobster roll but with shrimp instead.  I enjoyed it quite a bit and thought that the bun they used was pretty high quality.  The fries were crispy, thick and overall really good.

I would say the service was kind of lacking.  It was difficult at times to get the waitress' attention and when we did she seemed kind of indifferent.  I'd still come back here though especially if I was in the Quartier des Spectacles.
