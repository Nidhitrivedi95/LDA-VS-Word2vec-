4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I was in Vegas recently for my company's annual conference and me and my team came here for dinner one night. I found it on Yelp and thought it had decent reviews and not nearly as expensive as many others restaurants on the strip. 

We had a great experience here. We started with ordering wine, in which our server gracefully let us taste test before purchasing a bottle. We ordered a few appetizers, escargot included (my coworkers ate and loved.... I wouldn't try it!) and each got an order of steak. It was pretty tasty, full of flavor and the fries that came with it were great. It wasn't the best steak I've ever tried but definitely fulfilled my cravings and ended up being a great dinner. 

Our server was very friendly and gave us some good pointers on what to order. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others!
