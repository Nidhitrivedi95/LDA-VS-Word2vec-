nXlKHnArL3_vugmnytsEYQ Great find! Had the charcuterie platter, pickles, savory bread pudding and lamb tri-tip and would do recommend them all. The small plates were perfect for trying a bunch of dishes. We would order a couple of things, eat, then order more if we were still hungry. We left full, without leftovers and with a reasonable bill for the excellent quality of food (around $75). We had great service, but that may be a bit enhanced because of our early reservation, at 6:30.
