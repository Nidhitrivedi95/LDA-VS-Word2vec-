diw9UvW8mE24RGs-NXB_Tw I've been to the strip mall in which Fenix is located countless times and have never eaten there...until earlier tonight.

Fenix is a chill, mellow brasserie with a nice interior. I started off with the Fenix salad, which is basically your standard plate of mixed greens with some capers and onions. My friends had the French onion soup and the mussels for their appetizers - both enjoyed them immensely. I'd strongly recommend the mussels - they were massive and were cooked well in a great garlic butter sauce.

For entrees my friends had the New York Steak with potatoes and the Osso Buco (veal shank over pasta). I had the beef short ribs. All the meat was cooked real well and had full flavor. I really enjoyed my dish. However, with our appetizers, none of us could finish and we all took about half our meals home. My friend with the osso buco didn't really enjoy the meat being paired with egg flat noodle pasta, but she did think the meat was done well and delicious. She also received a smaller fork to pick out the marrow from the bone, which she was more than happy with.

The service was excellent in the beginning but really tapered off as dinner went on, at the end not asking if we cared to see the dessert menu. No big deal, but it didn't let Fenix get a full 5-stars in my book. Still, I'd recommend it to others who are looking for nice restaurant to get their grub on.

Entrees range from mid-teens to high 20's. Add apps and maybe some wine and you're looking around $35-40/person.
