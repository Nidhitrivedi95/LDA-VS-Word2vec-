gh6__q2WXFuyN8gt6VAnWw My wife and I had dinner at Vila Algarve for the first time last night.  We had a wonderful meal.  We started with the grilled goat cheese appetizer which was off the chart.  I had a hanging beef kabob and my wife had salted Cod.  None of these dishes were what we would have normally ordered but our waiter and the owner who came over and introduced herself were very helpful in making recommendations.  The food was delicious and the service was first rate.  We will definitely go back.  Not only was the food great but the prices were very reasonable.  You need to check it out.
