On top of that, the special is a Sonoma Quail wrapped in Bacon stuffed with black truffle and foie gras. So, all of the above ingredients are supposed to be in the dish. The quail was in the dish. But there was no foie gras, no black truffle and no bacon. In essence, I got a dish that tasted like a plain, old meatball.  I asked the server about it and he says that the quail is infused with foie gras and black truffle. I guess it's so infused that you can't taste it or see it. I thought it was supposed to be "stuffed" with foie gras and black truffle. I guess one person's stuffed is another person's stuffed not so much. The positive was the tap water was excellent. Oh well, $34 plus tax and tip down the Le Toilet.
