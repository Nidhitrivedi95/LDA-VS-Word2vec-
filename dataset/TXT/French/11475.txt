4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw My friends and I went here as our last dinner in Vegas. It is just so pretty and classy in there and it was a great way to end the trip with a bang :) This place is pretty pricey but hey, youve already made the trip out here and probably spent hella money. The wait wasnt that bad actually because we went on a Monday night.

I got the onion soup and it was my first time having it. I was expecting it to be jam packed with flavor but I personally didnt think it was that great. The layer of cheese onion on top was too thick and I just thought it was a weird combo. I got the Filet Mignon for $32 and split with a friend since we didnt want to be bloated before heading out. The meat was super tender and tasted very buttery. I loved the frites because they were so fried and delicious. Id much rather have that than huge pieces of potatoes.

The atmosphere and the ambiance was great and the food was good but overpriced. 

**TIPS**
1) I would skip out on the onion soup unless you like really like it.
2) Dress to impress when you go here :)
3) Enjoy!
