Ive read the reviews for months and every time I find myself deciding where to eat I somehow forget to include this in my list of options. Its located in a business park which accounts for 70% of my inability to see it while driving down the road. But I assure you, 3 seconds after walking in the door I immediately recognized what all the hype is about.  And all of it is well deserved. 

The owner is working behind the counter and has no reservations abouts welcoming every patron walking in the door. Despite being busy, he took the time to explain the menu in fairly good detail. Hes undoubtedly one of the most pleasant individuals ive ever encountered,  especially in the service industry.  His disposition alone would bring me back. But the food itself is an amazingly executed blend of french and american flavor combinations that sets this establishment far above the rest. I ordered the pesto chicken sandwich.  And it was devine. Without a doubt, one of the best ive ever eaten. Regardless of where you live in the city, its a necessity that you give this place a try.
