9ot8oInkYZTt6wkkGe__vQ Had the chef's tasting menu. The service was sub par for such a nice restaurant. There was only one waiter for our area and he was not very attentive and did not realize that we were sitting for 35 minutes after ordering without any food at our table. His excuse was "I punched it in and don't know what happened", not very consoling for a $350 dinner. The food was sub par as well. Our expectations were much higher than what they delivered. The steak was dry and flavourless. The seared tuna was cold, the "greens" was a joke. They gave us a piece of shaved cucumber with a few flowers??? What a joke!  Overall one of the worst experiences for such an expensive dinner. Will not be going back.
