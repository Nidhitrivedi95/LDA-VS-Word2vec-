cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg Amazing food and service; could not have asked for a better dining experience. Everyone and everything at Au Pied was perfect. The only bad part of the whole experience was that I didn't have room for dessert...

MUST ORDER: Charcuterie from Sugar Shack. It really doesn't get any better or fresher than this. The meats are sliced table side, drizzled with olive oil and served with a maple fritter. 

MUST TRY: Stuffed Pork Shank w/ Foie Gras and Mashed Potatoes. Super rich, fatty dish that will put you over the top and in a coma. A tad on the salty side but still very tasty. Definitely not for the faint of heart. I recommend this dish if you have 3+ people to share with. 

Highly recommend snacking or dining here!
