I2nw7LGLSHN4uUgnHO5H7A Very cute ambiance in a house just off Queen St. E in the Beach neighbourhood.

Food was ok. The salad was pretty plain and disappointing. The steak was tasty. The spinach that accompanied the steak was good. The pork tenderloin was ok. The parsnip purée wasn't that great. The descriptions make them sound delicious--with the apple and rosemary flavours--but for some reason these didn't really shine and weren't as good as they sounded. The drink my friend ordered called "Metrosexual" tasted mainly of vodka. It had cassis in it. I wonder what makes it metrosexual...

Service was somewhat rushed-feeling, and I also felt pressured to order a dessert. It was also somewhat impersonal. Everything seemed to be timed right though, and she was very good at filling the water.

Lots of older and middle-aged clientele there. We were probably the only ones under 30 (or 50 for that matter).

The building is very nice inside and out. It has a very romantic feel. A good place to eat in the beaches for sure. I would recommend giving it a try.
