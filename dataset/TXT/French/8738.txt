4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Well, this restaurant was everything I hoped it would be.  The smells coming from it before we even got in and sat down were heavenly.  We made dinner reservations and even though there was a long line, we were accommodated right away.  The triple cream cheese with mushrooms was a divine appetizer.  I ordered the beef wellington with the garlic spinach.  Absolutely outstanding.  I don't think I stopped thinking about this dish for days.  The service was very good as well. I would certainly eat here again.  The only thing I would suggest is try to get in by 6 pm for dinner, at the latest.  By the time we were done at 7:15, the line was almost out the door.
