cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg One of my favourite Montreal establishments. Huge helpings of food, easily enough to feed two people with a single main course. Go easy on the ordering, it's easy to overstuff yourself, but the food's fantastic.

The staff is friendly and not at all pretentious. Our table took a while to become ready, and the staff brought over complimentary drinks for all of us to apologize, even though it wasn't really their fault. Can't recommend it enough.
