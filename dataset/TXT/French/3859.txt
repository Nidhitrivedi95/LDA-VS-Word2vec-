2B46bRpDh49eDyjXGhL_ZQ I haven't yet tried the galettes, but I would like to do so; I was disappointed with the sweet crepes selection, which have only one fruit each and seem to emphasize more sugary aspects (whipped cream, nutella, etc.). I had a smoothie, which had a decent flavor balance, but I wish the flax seeds were ground into powder.
