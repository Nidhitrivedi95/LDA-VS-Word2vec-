QlSpPzc4Oy05ic-PsoYH4g This place is so cute (in a hip kind of way). My husband and I came here before listening to music on Carson. The bartender was really cool. I ordered the "south side" beverage which was gin, lemon, simple syrup and mint. Delicious! I'm super excited! I'll have to come back when there's more people! The music is excellent here too! Very chill place. I'd come and bring my girlfriends here too.

Side note: I know very little about interior design but I really like what's going on here. From the hardwood floor to the graffiti wall art, to the spray painted metallic brick - I'm feeling it!
