prPzWXNUJKZGnzVYqxRLsw This is a great restaurant. The food is superb, and the prices reasonable. We have never been disappointed. Despite the comments about seniors noted in other reviews, Café Pleiade attracts people of all ages. This restaurant is an institution on Mt Pleasant and has been serving excellent meals for years. If you are looking for a hidden gem frequented by locals, this is the place.
Incidentally, the interesting art on the walls comes from the owners collection. She is the server, so ask her about the pieces.
