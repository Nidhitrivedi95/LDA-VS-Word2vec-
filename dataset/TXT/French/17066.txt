9ET_RUNztevq4_OLAX80Gg I judge restaurants by how they handle fish, because if they can handle such a delicate product, it shows attention to detail.
The sockeye salmon was, they assured me, flown in daily, as was the halibut. Indeed they were fresh, and the dashi stock provided the perfect savory flavor to the fatty red. The salmon was delicious, with no hint of a rancid smell - every bite was delicious.
The pea risotto for an appetizer was fresh and delicious - a perfect way to start a meal.
The steak, probably made with Sous Vide technique, was made perfectly and the bone marrow on top is always a favorite of mine. 
The wine list has many French favorites, but the Italian wines are well represented. The staff knows the wines quite well and made two good recommendations based upon the flavor profile we requested. 
Simple food, made well, and great wine with a knowledgeable staff.
The restaurant decor is casual, but clean and elegant. The artwork on the walls add to the staff.
We then came for breakfast the next morning, and they continued to do a fine job.
Highly recommend this restaurant for your stay.
