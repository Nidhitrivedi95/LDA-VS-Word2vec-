hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA Great service. The employees are friendly, everyone was in a good mood. The place was kind of hidden but I found it eventually. I had the chipotle panini with chicken and bacon on the inside and it was so delicious! The bread that it was in was so soft and had a perfect crunch to it. It also came with a salad and it was a great portion. It wasn't too small of a meal and it wasn't too much.
