4O8fzz9F-XEsQ-gTMgkiyQ I went here because Gibby's was too busy. It was a quiet, fine dining looking place. The service was fantastic. I ordered the 12hr braised lamb and I thought it was pretty good. My one complaint is the prices are high, but not too much different than the rest of Montreal. I would recommend this place if you can't get in one of the other places like Gibby's. We had a couple of desserts and neither were very good. We also had the tapas appetizer which weren't that great.
