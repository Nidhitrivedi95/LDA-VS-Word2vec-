lcTa0q9Wo4wNyLCIgWFRUA Went to La Société Montréal tonight with a friend, we are on vacation in Montreal and have been cooking our own meals for the past few nights, but decided we wanted to go out and have a nice meal. We chose La Société after looking up many well-rated French restaurants in the downtown Montreal area, so we were looking foward to the nice decor, and supposedly amazing French food.

Unfortunately, the food AND the service was bad. My duck confit was terribly dry. I loved the the Leek and Vinaigrette appetizer, which was the only redeeming part of the evening. My friend's hanger steak and frites supposedly was alright, however it needed more salt, as opposed to my duck which was too salty. 

What really gave this restaurant one star was the service. We waited and waited for our waiter to come and ask us for our orders and also for any sort of refill on water or drinks, even though the restaurant only had two other parties present. My friend was charged refills on her soft drink and when asked about it, our waiter mentioned that "Mcdonald's might do free refills, but nice restaurants DO NOT." Whether that is true or not, I would say it's very out of turn for a waiter to mention that. Plus, I have never experienced a nice French restaurant that charges refills on a Coke of all things. They took the refill charges off, but the attitude given was not appreciated, wrong or right. 

Overall, sad experience for a place so highly rated.
