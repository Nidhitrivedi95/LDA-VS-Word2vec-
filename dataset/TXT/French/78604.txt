ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug Was in town to visit family members but also for some business meetings. We are here for breakfast and I am happy we did. We are Diamond card members so we were able to skip the super long line and sit in the VIP area before being seated. The food was great along with the service. I never like to go to Vegas on weekends, but for a weekday there was not a long wait at all and everyone was amazing. I will continue to stop by whenever I am in town again.
