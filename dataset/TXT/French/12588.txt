4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I WISH my friend Gabi would make me meals like this.

So, I'm aware that this place is known for their steak frites, but I wanted seafood.

And seafood we got!

We ordered the seafood platter (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mon-ami-gabi-las-vegas-2?selected=infUdLdU8Lm-OPaopoadRg#6LQDxF9qMuHI0QcaD0XTng), which came with a whole Maine lobster, jumbo shrimp, oysters, salmon tartare with avocado and baguette chips--all served on a bed of ice with cocktail sauce, mignonette (a vinegary accompaniment to the oysters), and gribiche (a mustard-y dipping sauce).

The place is lovely; it's lit really well and not pretentious in any way. The service was great, and the food was even better.

Great place to sit outside, enjoy the weather, the food, and people-watch.
