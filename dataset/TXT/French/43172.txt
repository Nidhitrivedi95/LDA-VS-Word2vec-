The service is impeccable! Every employee is aware of his or her surroundings and more than happy to accommodate your every need or desire. The staff is well-trained and knowledgeable. If we so much as needed an extra glass or piece of silverware replaced, it was taken care of instantly.  Our waters were always filled, and when I attempted to remove my jacket at the table, a staff member immediately came over to help me with it. It was by far the best service we have ever experienced, but it should be expected at this price range. 

I would highly recommend ordering the tasting menu with wine-paring if your're not in a large party to order most courses to share. At a reduced price, they offer a vegetarian tasting menu with wine-pairing.  The wines were paired beautifully albeit at a hefty markup. Every dish was exquisitely prepared and seasoned perfectly. The Wagyu beef was perfectly marbled and melted in my mouth. We both had a different risotto dish, and both were full of flavor and prepared perfectly. The presentation and temperature of every dish were also spot on. A couple of the pastry items didn't impress us very much, but were still more than tasty. We also tried the cheese tray with wine and while it was good, it was a little over priced for what you get. 

Overall Alex offers a unique, memorable dining experience that I would recommend to anyone who doesn't mind parting with a significant amount of cash (over $850 for 2 including gratuity) and would appreciate top-notch food and insanely good service.
