intKyiipUlHDWi_chv0f3A What a treat Merchant Street was for us. My husband and I were visiting Cleveland and we were staying in Tremont. We were greeted with smiles and felt welcomed the second we walked in. 

We had the mussels and sausage flat bread as appetizers. Both were absolutely delicious. The broth and sauce that the mussels came with was pleasing to the taste buds. My husband had the burger for dinner and I had the salmon with pasta. Both dishes were satisfying. I have to say the pasta was probably one of the best pastas I have ever had. Whatever ingredients Joshua the chef used for the pasta sauce was just heavenly. 

Everything about our dinner at Merchant Street was just delightful and was the best dinner we had during our stay in Cleveland. The owner, chef and staff made us feel like special guests which makes it the icing on the cake when having a delicious dinner experience. If we're in Cleveland again, this will be our first stop for dinner.
