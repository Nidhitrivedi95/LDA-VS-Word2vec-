4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw ehh  overrated!!
price was ok, but the food was not. 
Our steak was really thin and dry. We requested medium-rare but what they gave us was overcooked..
other plates didn't have much flavor.. 
One thing I HATED!!about this place was the menu they handed us.
I was sticky, dirty, blurry at some parts... ewww
seriously, they should print new ones and put new covers on it..
