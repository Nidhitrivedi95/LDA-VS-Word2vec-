mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q A friend who works at Le Bernadin in NYC told me he ate one of the best meals of his life here, so naturally that was all the recommendation I needed to make a reservation for my first night in Vegas (sent alone on business for a couple days)

The night started off a bit rocky - I was a few minutes late for a 9pm reservation, and was told it would be 20-30 minutes because they were running behind, and I could come back.  I've never been told that so matter-of-factly with no apology before at ANY restaurant in ANY city when I had actually made a reservation, so naturally I was a little pissed.  Also, I had booked it there so I was hot and sweaty and thirsty, and I was tired and hungry because I had just flown in from the east coast and it was midnight my time.  Go wander around the casino for 30 minutes and hope a seat will be ready then?  No thanks.  After looking around for a minute aimlessly trying to figure out what I wanted, I realized what it was - water.  I was obviously quite annoyed and I think it came through to the hostess when I asked if I could at least have some water, so after she popped inside and came back out (there is no where to wait in the restaurant itself - the hostess stand is outside of it in the casino), and asked me if I wanted to wait at the back bar until my reservation was ready.  OF COURSE.  Thank you.  Maybe offer that in the first place to someone dining alone when their reservation is going to be at least 30 minutes late?  Hostess(es) could use a little more training.

So, i grabbed one of the three seats at the back bar area and promptly downed a glass of water.  I really enjoy chatting up strangers when I'm traveling alone, and the man working the bar (Tedman - a unique name for sure) quickly became my buddy for the evening.  He brought me some bread, and we chatted about this and that, 30 minutes later my "reservation" seat still wasn't ready, but I also realized that if I moved over to the main bar area overlooking the kitchen, I'd really be eating a very long meal truly alone, because the servers there would be super busy.  I said to Tedman, "Man I wish I could just eat back here so we can keep hanging out," and he replied, "Do you want to?"  OF COURSE I DO!!!  I didn't even know that was an option!!  DAMN IT!

I was super happy to continue hanging out with Tedman while he made drinks for the restaurant, and while I had intended to do one of the smaller tasting menus, everything I really wanted to try was on the Discovery Tasting menu ($185), and I just couldn't resist.  Best.  Decision.  Ever.  A few of the highlights:

-The bread basket. Oh, god, the bread basket.  Those fluffly little croissant like spirals - I will dream of them.  So, so, so good. The butter flown in from france that comes with it?  AAAAAAAAH FEED ME BUTTER.

-The foie gras parfait - you mean a foie gras pudding cup?  Um, yes please.

-The oysters - I don't eat oysters.  I don't like oysters.  I've never had an oyster I liked.  I downed these three in 10 seconds flat.  Might have been because they were swimming in French salted butter.  

-The white onion tart was one of the best composed, flavorful, and interesting dishes I've had in any restaurant, anywhere.  Didn't hurt that it was covered in black truffles ;)

-The foie gras ravioli - ooooh goooooood little nuggets of juicy foie gras heaven (are you sensing that I like foie gras?). And I had to sit on my hands not to drink the rest of the broth straight from the bowl so I didn't fill up.

I'll add I was a little disappointed in the foie gras stuffed quail.  It was a little too sweet, and I couldn't really taste the foie gras all that much.  However, the mashed potatoes that came with it - HOLY WOW.  Best mashed potatoes I've ever, ever had.  Clearly 50% butter.

At some point the manager - Ben - was standing back in that area surveying his restaurant, and we started chatting.  And...basically we didn't stop.  Every moment he had while he keenly observed his staff and well-oiled machine of a restaurant, he was back hanging out with me - talking about the food, his family, our lives, our plans.  Between Ben and Tedman it was not only an amazing meal, but an amazing experience.  They both really seemed to like watching me enjoy the food so much, they brought me a second bread basket with cheesy bread that I "had to try" and more of my favorite little pinwheels from next door, and in between my two dessert courses also brought me a dessert sampler from the candy cart at The Mansion.  Ben also grabbed me before I left and gave me an unsolicited tour of the kitchen both restaurants share.  It was a wonderful gift, and an awesome cap to an amazing experience, and phenomenal meal. Thank you Ben!

Aside from the hiccup of their being really backed up (the reasoning behind which was explained to me and I don't have enough space to write), the whole night was wonderful. I finished dinner at 3am my (let lagged) time, and couldn't have been happier.
