kcF-en40P3J9L8nLy5lKqQ Since moving to the area last year, I've had Central Bistro on my Yelp bookmarks. For some reason, we hadn't made it over until a few weekends ago. My husband, his parents, and I headed over there for Sunday brunch. We had a reservation for noon and were seated almost immediately.

We were told they had fresh doughnuts (espresso with coffee glaze) and ordered some. Holy moly, they were warm and delicious! I ordered the naked pancake (one of the best pancakes I've ever had - and holy moly, they were HUGE and I got three of them! I could only eat one!) , my husband got the club sandwich (which he loved), my father in law got the Cuban sandwich (it was a big hit), and my mother in law got a really delicious superfood salad. Food was seriously awesome, and definitely filling.

The servers are dressed so adorably - their "uniforms" fit the gorgeous restaurant perfectly. It was a super comfortable atmosphere. One of the coolest/most unique things is the underside of their tables are lined with carpeting! I know this may seem like not a big deal, but I can't tell you how many times I've worn tights or leggings to a restaurant and had them snagged by the underside of a wooden table. So that was definitely a nice touch.

Here's my only gripe: there were musicians playing fairly loudly almost the whole time we were eating. I know some people enjoy live music while eating, but I go out to eat to visit with friends and family. My father in law was sitting closest to the musicians (who were definitely super talented) and I had to basically talk into his ear for him to hear me. In the future, I'll definitely request outdoor seating for brunch (or near the bar) so the music isn't so loud.

Overall, wonderful experience. We will definitely be back - for brunch, lunch, and to try dinner!
