SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA We have heard great reviews about this place.  And it deserves all the praise.  There aren't many places in Cleveland which serve modern cuisine and those which claim to do so usually present lackluster dishes.  This place likes to have fun with it's classic French comfort food.  And the service was fast, friendly and warm but not overbearing.  The charcuterie plate was delicious and simple.  They presented cured meats and pate so creamy.  As for entrees, the mussels with pomme frites rivals a similar dish served at a famous NYC brasserie in the meat packing district.  The flavors were clean and tasty.  The ingredients were not muddled with too much seasoning.  The duck confit was also really stellar.  The duck was so satisfying.  You can tell the chef took great care not to overwork the duck in the cooking.  The sweet potatoes puree and red cabbage complemented the duck so perfectly.  I couldn't get enough of it.  They serve dishes like this at places like Ortolan in LA but L'albatros does it with really really reasonable prices.  We finished off with the blood orange frozen souflee and espressos.  It was great but the apps and entrees are where this restaurant shines.
