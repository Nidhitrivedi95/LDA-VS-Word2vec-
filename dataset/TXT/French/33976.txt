Tiny little spot owned by a French family who makes the best quiche I've ever had.  I also had an incredibly delicious baguette sandwich that I will definitely order again. The baguette was crisp and thin on the outside, buttery and soft on the inside. I also ordered the leek  and potato soup-not vichyssoise because it was not blended-  but oh so delicious.  
Oh my gosh!  I can't even talk about the twisted chocolate croissants that literally melted in my mouth. Unfortunately I live in Henderson and this place is on Summerlin Parkway and Buffalo. Hopefully they will come to Henderson because we really need them here. Great spot. Only open for breakfast and lunch.
