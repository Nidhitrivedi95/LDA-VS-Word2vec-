The food was good; escargot was very tasty (but please provide an escargot fork, it was difficult wrangling the snails with a dinner fork), onion soup and salad were excellent, as was the Scottish salmon.  The lobster roll was good, but a bit skimpy for the price.  Be aware that the lunch menu is quite limited, but tasty.
