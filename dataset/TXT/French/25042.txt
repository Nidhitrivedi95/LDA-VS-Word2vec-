Walking into Mix after a VIP elevator ride to the 64th floor lets you know right off the bat what you're in for--a restaurant that prides itself on impressing with the appearance of eliteness. You walk through the dark black and red lounge into the uber-modern, all white, all open dining space littered with tables. Beautiful, yes, but a place you can settle in for a relaxing, private meal? Definitely not.

Las Vegas is all about spectacle, and Mix definitely has that. But everything from the doorstop of a wine menu to the 18 different servers who hover over you as you eat discourages complete enjoyment. You're so busy trying not to look un-chic that you forget to have fun.

And the food--excellent, no question. I had the curried lobster and my fella had the bison tenderloin. The portions were small but impeccably cooked and flavored. The bison was so tender, it made me angry at every other steak I'd ever had. The prices are quite high, even for Vegas. The cocktail list is all sweet, flavored vodka drinks--they want you to drink wine anyway.

Bottom line--great food overwhelmed by a snooty vibe and personality-less service.
