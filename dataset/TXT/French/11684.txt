Next time I go, I'm totally gonna get the brie and Apple crepe, sounds right up my alley!  I got the eggs benedict, if was good except the English muffin was so tough, I was getting carpal tunnel trying to cut the thing.  Almost tempted to just grab it with my hand and eat it classlessly!  Coffee was great, atmosphere is great if you sit outside, kind of feels like you're in Europe for a bit :). Came on a Monday right at 11am, no wait, and even though breakfast is over at 11, we still got to order it.
