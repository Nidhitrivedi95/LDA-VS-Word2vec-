4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I went with a vendor and 30 others. Was not expecting much but the ribeye was cooked to perfection (medium rare as requested) and the mash potatoes were to die for.....so creamy. The asparagus was top notch as well.  Over all, did not feel like I ate at French restaurant, but who cares.l as food was great.
