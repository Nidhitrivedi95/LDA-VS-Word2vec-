dW9cPsvOGwlOpiz3wEBgiQ We happened upon this place by chance back in October and had a fabulous lunch.  When we decided to return to Vegas recently, it was a given that we'd stop by again.  Great authentic French food -- we were just in Paris over the summer.  Excellent value and friendly service.  We loved the open face sandwich, the escargot, and quiche.  Hopefully we'll get a chance to stop by for dinner some time.  The nearby casino is closed and people probably don't realize that all these restaurants are still trying to survive out there.  Stop by for a meal at Bernard's -- you'll be glad you did.
