i5vxtyiHKYnRcJ0p9N7mLw My husband and I went out for a late lunch Sunday. I was worried it might be crowded for Father's Day but I think it was late enough to miss crowd. We split an Antipasto salad and bowl of pasta Bolognese. The salad had big pieces of artichokes, shaved parmesan, 2 or 3 different types of deli meat. It was delicious. The person next to us was eating a slice of white pizza. I was talking with him and didn't see it on the menu. Next thing you know Carlo brought over a slice for us to try. Super nice guy and the pizza was good. He loves to interact with his customers. The pasta bolognese was also very very good! We will difinitely be back to try more of their menu. PS they also have delicious homemade desserts. Cannolis we're Awesome
