O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q This will be short and sweet. I ordered the french toast....Took one bite and said its the best thing I've ever tasted in my life! My wife's was also awesome- scrambled eggs/salmon crepes.  Oh, and the hand crafted bloody mary was exceptional with hand crushed tomatoes, garlc salt and who knows what else!
