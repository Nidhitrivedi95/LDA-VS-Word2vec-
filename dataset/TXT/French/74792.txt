xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g We celebrated a special occasion with a fantastic dinner in a front row window table overlooking the Bellagio Fountains. We arrived a little early for our reservation but the hostess stated our table was ready.  The wait staff was friendly and each member was attentive from the choice of breads to refilling water glasses to following up on the satisfaction of our meal.
The pace was unhurried and just right. 

The Beef Tenderloin Filet Mignon was cooked to perfection and delicious. We shared the potato Anna, crispy sliced buttery potatos and the green beans almondine that was fresh and al dente. Both side dishes are ample in size and perfect for sharing. The Wild Snapper Filet had a crispy skin with a moist and tender inside. The fish was served on a bed of Belgium Endive along side Confit Orange with a Bordelaise sauce. This entree was just supurb. 

We were offered 3 complementry desserts. First a small chocolate mousse topped with whip cream and a slice of chocolate served on a plate with "Happy Anniversary" piped in chocolate around the rim. Very smooth. The second dessert was an artist pallid with 6 different sorbets and in the center a large strawberry incased in hardened sugar. This dessert was over the top. Third we were then presented with and able to choose from an assortment of petit fours. So glad we did not order dessert off the menu.
The entire restaurant staff contributed to making this a very special experience. With the night time view of Las Vegas Blvd.10 stories below it was like going to the theater.  

We have been big fans of Lettuce Entertain You restaurants from their beginning with R.J. Grunts in Chicago over 40 years ago. Thanks Rich Melman, keep the great restaurants coming.
