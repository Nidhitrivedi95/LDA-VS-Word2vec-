l1LdgkukyBc88pxv1KJrLg Well, I guess this is the place to buy churros in Montreal. Haven't tried any of their empanadas and other dishes, but the churros are fresh and quite exquisite. Staff is friendly too. No place to sit down really, just grab a couple churros and find a friend to share them with while shopping for wedding dresses on Plaza St-Hubert.
