37kk0IW6jL7ZlxZF6k2QBg To be fair, I think my rating would be a solid 3.5... Not quite a 4, but better than a 3.

My guest and I decided to try out this place because of all the hype. I went because they had Hay chicken!!! It's chicken people, cooked in Hay... unfortunately they didn't get any of their special chickens in SO we decided to try the 7 course tasting menu.

Yes, it's 7 courses but I'm Asian and we are used to 12. You do leave full but not uncomfortably so.

Highlights for me:
- (Free-kinda) Artisan bread, nice and crusty
- Lamb - perfectly done
- Dessert - the cheesecake with this crazy hazelnut pastry, winner. 

Lowlights for me:
- Clear soup - really? Clear soup?
- Seared pickerel... Maybe it's the fish... Did nothing for me.
- Octopus... Maybe if I liked Octopus more, I would enjoy it more. It was fresh but I didn't find it flavourful.  Octopus should melt in your mouth, not kinda smooshy and slimy.

All in all, it's a nice experience. The place is quaint. Blink and you'll miss it. The wait staff are really nice. If you've never been, go check it out. It's always nice to be surprised at every dish that comes... Just let them know your allergies before the food starts coming out! And it's all seasonal and local, which probably means you should go in the spring and summer, where in Toronto, there's more choice for artisan places like this.

Go leeks!
