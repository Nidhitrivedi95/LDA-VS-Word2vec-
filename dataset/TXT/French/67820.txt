UxWH8zRYIBgs6Q2oykvRdw The decor is so, so gorgeous and the entire staff--hosts and server were all sweethearts. 

I came here for brunch and ordered the organic beef burger with a gluten-free bun along with fries. The GF bread is really good--tastes like whole wheat which I haven't had since giving up gluten. The fresh orange juice is perfect (not an easy feat). 

Despite the mixed review, I want to return and try dinner. Honestly the atmosphere alone is worth the visit and overall Cluny exceeded my expectations.
