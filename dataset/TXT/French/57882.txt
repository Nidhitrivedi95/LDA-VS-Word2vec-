rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Hold onto your wallets as Bouchon is pricey but definitely worth it.  My girlfriend and I stopped in for brunch after a very long night.  Service was impeccable and the setting is gorgeous.  We started off with Bloody Mary's (because why not!).  Although they were small in size, the flavor was fresh and lively.  At $17 a pop, you might want to take it easy on them.  I opted for the roasted chicken and waffle while my girlfriend went with the eggs benedict.  Both were incredible.  Even incredible hungover, I absolutely devoured the chicken and waffle.  With maple syrup, butter and sauce Chasseur, it was the perfect blend of sweet and savory.  The Eggs Benedict were executed to perfection.  An incredible meal but one that comes with a price. Enjoy!
