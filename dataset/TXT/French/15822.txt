6GCbZASjMnAPYBWLc_z30g My Elderly Aunt was visiting from out of town this week and we took her to Mimi's last night.  There were 5 of us in our party.  In the past, Mimi's has had great food and service and our kids love the menu.  
Not so anymore, I was downright embarrassed by the waitress and the lousy food.  

First, I asked for lemon with my iced tea and the waitress never brought it.  The restaurant was nearly empty on a Friday night so she was not busy.
The iced tea had a funky "off" taste so my husband and I asked if we could have two coke's instead.  She obliged, but insisted that the tea was fresh.  If I had a lab nearby, I would bet the tea was old and loaded with bacteria.

Secondly, the waitress never took the "old" tea when she brought the replacements.  The tables are small enough without the extra dishes cluttering everywhere.  My Aunt even commented on not having room at the table and the waitress seemed clueless.

When our "medium well" burgers arrived they were raw inside!  We sent them back, which I hate to do because I fear retaliation from the kitchen.  My Aunt (has very little strength in her hands) asked the waitress if she would put her chicken pot pie in a 2-go container for her. This clearly pissed off the waitress and she made a snarky remark, grabbed the container and walked away.  I am afraid to reheat this after we could clearly see her anger toward my Aunt.
Overall, the experience was embarrassing, expensive, and a huge REGRET.  We will never eat at Mimi's again.  BTW, we asked for more bread at the table and we were charged as it was added to our bill and sent in a to go bag.   WTF????
