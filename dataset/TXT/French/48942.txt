OkC86YtZ0Nm19my5F4GGrQ Oven baked dates stuffed with goat cheese. Holy deliciousness! My French cuisine obsessed friend introduced me to this place, and suddenly I feel sad to leave Cleveland. Places like this truly makes it worthy of staying here. Hidden in the very heart of Rocky River downtown, surrounded by stores selling shoes and bridal dresses at the price of private jets, Tartine bistro has that enchanting intimate posh atmosphere of the Parisian café. Don't get me wrong. Prices are not low and portions are not huge, but if you want to try out some fresh exotic dishes, it's the place to be. We were not on any kind of romantic escapade, so just hit the jackpot by ravaging happy hour ( only $5 each) specials: we had mussels (delicious with broth), beet salad ( did you know there is such thing as yellow beets?), dates mentioned above and house wine ( decent) and also $5. Staff was very accommodating, letting us order items from happy hour even though there was only couple of minutes left till the end of it.
With less than $40, we had an entire France on our plate, literally. Now this place is not a hip joint, your waitress will be polite, won't "honey" you, with hair and no tattoos, there will be no bartender with muscles and attitude. The crowd is a little bit geriatric, no "window-shopping" here. Whoever comes here should be solely interested in their company and good French cuisine. You know the way it was when the good dining was only about having a good meal in a classy quiet place. Like a century ago.
