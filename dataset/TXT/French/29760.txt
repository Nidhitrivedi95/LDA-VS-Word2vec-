Ffwu9VQ2GAfd-BdNmE0qgw Surprisingly upscale French restaurant for the very local, neighborhood-y vibe.

My friends and I came for dinner after 9pm on a Thursday. The upper floor terrace was totally packed, but we got a nice seat by the window on the bottom floor. We seemed to be one of the few people on the bottom floor given the nice weather, but the waiters were still great about being available and providing great dining service.

The food definitely seemed to be a good value for the price and quality of the food we got. The pork loin and duck confit were the winners at the table. I also really loved the foie gras mousse that came out as an amuse bouche.

This was a very traditional French meal and very memorable!
