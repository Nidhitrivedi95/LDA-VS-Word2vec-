7Ug8zCmY6iDTewxWqeYQ2g Quaint restaurant that appears to be frequented by locals. The cuisine is simple, fresh, and thoughtfully prepared.  I had the carrot soup, beef with risotto and creme brulee, and my date had the zucchini flower app and rabbit with carrot puree. The beef cut was surprisingly served on top a large bone and the risotto had a rustic preparation. The rabbit was flavorful and tender.  We enjoyed that we could bring our own wine and that it was an intimate setting -- great for a date.
