xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g Put this on your "bucket list".... must have Lamb Burger from Eiffel Tower restaurant @ Paris Hotel

This lamb burger is the F'ing Bomb. So much flavor. For $16 , you get lamb burger with fries. Add a "coke" plus tax tip is $25 for the Lamb Burger Experience... Well worth it.

There's a dress code. And you have to make your way through a casino. But the food is magnifique !

Very Professional and courteous staff. Spectacular view
