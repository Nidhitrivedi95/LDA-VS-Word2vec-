imzF-HGZjYZ8RivljMZWEw My friend and I decided to come and try Noca tonight just to get out and have a drink. Upon entrance  inside the establishment I was excited because I love new night spots in Charlotte. My friend and I walked in and sat at the bar waiting to be serviced. It was toward the end of the night and the bar really wasn't that busy or full. We tried flagging down the Asian female bartender as well as the two male bartenders working tonight. The female bartender looked very unbothered as if she was just behind the bar to be there, not to work. We sat at the bar for a good 20
Minutes trying to be patient, however the lack service and attentiveness resulted in our departure. It is really sad that the service in this establishment was so poor. As follow member of the hospitality industry I feel bad service is a representation of the establishment as a whole. I'm disappointed that I will not be bad, however a few words of advice would be to train employees on proper service as well as customer service.
