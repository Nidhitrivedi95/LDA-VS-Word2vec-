JsAjP49bCk9KjJmmmjyM4w One of the most charming, elegant, and incredibly edibly Queen West bastions of yumminess, I would lay prostate on the pavement for one of their freshly baked butter croissants and a cup of their amazing Lavazza coffee.  I would gladly be up in the early morning to make sure I get my share of their kitchen's magic before it's all gone.  I would pitch a tent outside their front door to scoop handfulls of their fresh custardly, freshly berried, fresh freshliness clafouti tarts.  

And then I would laugh as I stick my tongue out at Igor's former bicycle theft shop that's a few doors down.  But I digress.  

It's tiny, but that only adds to its charm: get your treat and walk through the park across the street.  Plan ahead and go there in the morning to wake your lover with lusciousness in bed.  And if you actually do get there when a table is available, enjoy that newspaper and the lovely street view for as long as you can, baby.
