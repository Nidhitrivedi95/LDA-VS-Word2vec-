gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg Les Trois Brasseurs is where I had poutine for the very first time.  It was a medley of flavors on a plate that really shouldn't have gone together so well--French fries, gravy and cheese curds--but came together in perfect harmony.  Mike had promised I'd enjoy it and I did despite my initial skepticism.  Overall, the restaurant is a fairly standard microbrewery with great food and people-watching.  I would definitely be interested in returning.
