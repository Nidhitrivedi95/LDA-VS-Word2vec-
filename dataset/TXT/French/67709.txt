UxWH8zRYIBgs6Q2oykvRdw Beautiful restaurant in the distillery district. Tried several dishes including the asparagus, lobster, frog legs, and escargot. Food was 4 stars all around. I like the vibe of the restaurant. Decor is great and the music perfect.  Service was friendly, knowledgeable and attentive. All in all great dining experience. Do indulge!
