58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw I can't believe that that little gem had never been mentioned to me. What a pity that all this time I haven't been blessed with the delicious enlightenment that is le Cartet.

To be honest- I've walked by this space several times and just assumed it was a specialty food shop that was ahem, well out of my price range. Don't be deceived like I was; as it turns out it's an amazing sit-down spot as well. My companion had the country-style breakfast, and while the whole thing looked awesome the most note-worthy thing about it is that the potatoes are cooked in duck fat (DUCK FAT POTATOES PEOPLE.) I ordered the "healthy" breakfast plate, complete with goat cheese toast and poached eggs; a yogurt parfait; as well as figs and cheese. yum.

The space is exactly what you're hoping for- a cozy and accommodating yet classy spot where even when the place is packed you can hear your brunchin' buddies. I can't wait to bring everyone ever here.
