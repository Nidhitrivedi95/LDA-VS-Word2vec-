0JGMKaKJGVuDus5WcJzvjw One of the best meals I've ever had.  We went big and got more food than we needed and it was worth it.  Every single thing was in the conversation for best dish I've had in years.  Menu changes so I suggest discussing the meals with you informed waiter/waitress to plan out your meal.
