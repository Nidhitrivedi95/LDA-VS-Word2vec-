bzbNGyrTwWHAgg1CqkSgeg Disgusting. Seriously the chicken and waffles are chicken tenders and waffles. The hash browns are so nasty they taste like the smell of the hotel glasses they keep in the room. Musty! Yuck never again. No wonder ppl from Charlotte think it's good because Charlotte has some of the worst food I've ever had. I'm a northern we have real food and real restaurants. I won't come back nasty! And my waitress never checked on me either. So terrible service so disappointed
