UxWH8zRYIBgs6Q2oykvRdw Went for Summerlicious with a friend.  We were given the regular menus without the Summerlicious menu. When I asked for the Summerlicious menu, the server, Anthony, just flat out said no without a smile. I took it as a joke and just laughed. We were impressed with the food.  However, the server was the worst server I've had in a really long time.  He only came to drop off the food and literally didn't say a word or made eye contact. We tried to get his attention multiple times but failed.  It was very busy but he wasn't busy with other customers, he was often socializing with other servers.  When we finally got his attention, we asked for boxes for our main courses since we didn't finish them and we asked for dessert and the bills all at once. My friend asked for separate bills and he replied, "yeah, that's fine" and walked away. When another server brought us our dessert, it was the wrong one.  We advised her that we ordered the profiterole, not the macaron; she replied, "Are you sure?"  with no apology. I figured that Anthony punched in the wrong thing.  Even though we asked for the bill with the dessert, we again, had to flag our server down. When he finally dropped off the bill, my friend immediately asked for the machine. When he came back with the machine, he, again, did not say a word and just punched the numbers in.

I understand that not everyone is a people person but if someone is working in customer service, they need to at least be able to fake it.
