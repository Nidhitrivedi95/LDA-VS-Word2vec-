eJ9L40jm5VOXCIq7xs9kQw We went here for the dinner after our small wedding.  The food was excellent quality - not quite what you can get in France but as good as it gets in North America.  The service was topnotch, our wine glasses were always full, courses were well timed so there was no rush to get through the dinner and we could enjoy the beautiful atmosphere and each other's company.  

I will say that we had no success in communicating with the restaurant in advance of our wedding.  We went in person once to discuss our options at which time the manager was very helpful and offered us several ways to customize the experience for our guests.  However, when we tried to follow up by phone and email we never managed to catch a person and no one returned our messages.  There was a mishap with our cake delivery, which we ordered from a local patisserie and which was never delivered.  The Bonaparte was informed to expect our cake delivery and didn't notify us in the morning that it never arrived.  While this is primarily the fault of the patisserie, the Bonaparte acknowledged their own small responsibility in this and made it up to us by serving one of their own cakes at no charge.

Overall, an excellent fine dining experience with exemplary service.
