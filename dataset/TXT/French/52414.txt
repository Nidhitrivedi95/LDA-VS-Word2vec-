q0n4I-zqiI47xispOqc1lA If you're looking for great food or coffee, this is the place to go. With a street side window, a cozy interior, and a beautiful secluded patio out back, it's the perfect place whether you're on the go, or in the mood for a nice sit down meal.
They have a great selection of crepes, omelettes, French toast, and bagels (and everything that we saw and tried was generously portioned). We tried the monte cristo french toast  and the mocha french toast and shared the Nutella and banana crepe to finish. Everything was delicious, and fairly priced. Etto, the owner, even came by to introduce himself and chat for a while, making our experience even more enjoyable.
Overall, we had a great time and definitely plan on going back.
