OL_dFyhAt3CVtbbS-DpgUw My husband and I just moved from Ottawa to King City this was our first date night since we arrived. We were greeted by  a charming hostess, the barman I am not sure of his name was amazing to say the least made me a great dirty Martini, and my husband had his beer while we waited patiently until the restaurant opened we were there at 4:45 Saturday the 28 of November the Christmas decorations were hung up with care the atmosphere super Romantic we sat in the Mackenzie Room. My husband had 10 oz steak and lobster, I had a 2 lobster tails shrimps, scallops along with their house wine as maritimer I can attest that my meal was deliciously beyond expectation my regards to their Chef! My husband finally had a meal that also met his fussy palate. We must Thank Sebastien for a magical evening along with the supporting staff that made the experience a success. I recommend this venue to any one who want to impress that special someone with the food atmosphere and special touch from the staff I give it a five on all aspects
We will definitely be back!
