WUq7NNgCTaPphTYL6qyEBQ Walked out!
We went out for a nice evening out at a nice restaurant and we were met with a mouthy, swearing chef. And the fact that we were served after other people arrived, didn't help. We have never seen this before!  The chef was verbally abusing the staff because they thought that they were a god. And management wasn't doing anything about that. Sorry, we don't have to listen to that on our dime!  And we weren't the only people that got up and left. A nice family with children left because their children were afraid. When we run into this, we don't care how good the food is. That was inexcusable. The owners need to fire this guy or their business will greatly suffer, if not go under. They can't afford that in his neighbourhood!  Too many good restaurants in this neighbourhood.
