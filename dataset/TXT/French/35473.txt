htQgj-ANQpZGpIpkkrEmyQ I've been waiting to come to this location for a while. I finally got in and was Very underwhelmed. 

Pros: 
Friendly staff.
They're straight up if they can't seat you. None of that come back in an hour stuff. 

Cons: 
The location is small.
Like very narrow. 

I tried the Chicken and waffles. 
I hated it BUT if you like dark meat pieces try it. 

If I go back(probably won't) I'm going to try the burger, I heard it was good.
