Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA Towering over the strip at the top of Mandalay Bay awaits a stunning view, and not much else.  Alain Ducasse's Mix, offers little more than a brilliant view, and a unique decor.  Think, eating inside a champagne bottle in a Swedish furniture store.

Before getting to your table, you will walk through MIx's club/lounge.  This awkward identity crisis of an area is enough to throw off what could be a very relaxing and luxurious ambience.  

The food was good, not great.  Especially disappointing was the Candy Bar on the dessert menu.  The Cucumber sorbet was light, breezy and refreshing, and certainly the highlight of the meal.  

Even after the delicious sorbet, I left Mix with a bitter taste in my mouth.  

Stop up for a cocktail and take in the view.  It is far more satisfying than the food.
