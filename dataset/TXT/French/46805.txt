nkHaix6KenApS8M-liZsCQ Christopher's restaurant is easily my favorite place to eat. I visit regularly during their Happy Hour and every time the service is amazing, the chefs are friendly, and the experience as a whole is remarkable. I can't say enough good things about this place. I would recommend the burger and combo fries or the croque monsieur, both are less than 10 bucks during happy hour. The burger blows the pants off any other burger at the Biltmore, and since Christopher's is a French restaurant, the croque is to die for. 

Every one of the staff members is extremely friendly and accommodating, I love this place.
