2QzGh0UPJVbjtRlujmBXpw Our first time to this restaurant. We were pleasantly surprised! First of, can i just say that our waiter, Royd (i hope that i got it right) was one of the best waiter that i've encountered so far in my life! Polite, courteous, professional and all-around nice! Even if the food was bad, i would forget all about it just because he is simply the best! 

But...

The food was excellent! Everything that we ordered was executed perfectly! The menu is very small so choices are limited. No problem when it's done right. All main comes with choice of salad or soup, tea or coffee. Appetizers and desserts are "à la carte". My hubby and i shared a salmon tartar that was so fresh and delicate! Very good! The table next to us had the escargots. We're going for that next time :) i got the lamb shank. Ohhh! Melts-in-your-mouth-deliciousness! Hubby ordered the  the venison (deer) with red wine reduction and foie gras (en torchon). Cooked medium rare and the portion of foie gras was so, so, so generous! The only thing that he would of liked was for the foie gras to be more tempered and not "out of the fridge to the plate" king of thing. He tried to see if they could torch it a bit knowing very well that the foie gras would melt like butter but the waiter (not ours. An older man) "kindly" refused. Heck... The food was so good that we let that slip by :/  Both our main had the same sides: gratin dauphinois (superb!), celeriac purée with a piece of prune, baby green beans and summer squash.

The meal summed up to a bit under 120$ taxes and tips included for the both of us. Not bad at all for a byob restaurant and not bad at all for the quality of the food and especially for the service we got from out fabulous waiter! 

Will definitely come back. 

Make sure to make reservations!!!
