hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA Thank you Yelp to bring me to those cool places! I understand why this place is in the top places in Las Vegas! I like the fact that we have finally a nice place to eat a little bit more upscale that the old bit up bakeries :-(. (Don't get me wrong, they're good but the experience is different). Finally a place outside the strip that blends perfectly atmosphere, food and service in Las Vegas! Gotta love it!

Atmosphere 4/5: Comfy chairs, they even have a sofa. The place is nice and looks new. It's not French touch but it's modern and different from other places! Quiet with some good music in background and you have the perfect mix for a good atmosphere. 
Food 5/5: I tried the Quiche Lorraine and the Bleu Brie Sandwich and it was awesome! I loved it! The Bleu Brie sandwich matched perfectly the taste of sweet (with the slices of apple) and sour ( with Bleu cheese)! Yes PERFECT!
Service 5/5: Service is excellent. The lady made sure to ask me that everything was alright even it's not a waiter service kind of place! Making sure that your customer is happy is their principal goal and you can feel it!

This place is entering into my must-go places now when I'm in Vegas! Thank you for bringing a little bit of modern classiness place outside the strip!! Awesome!
