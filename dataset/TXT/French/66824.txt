UpEVdq_euH-5mqCIgUAd2Q I wish I could say I had better feedback to offer after dining here today for a business lunch. I guess I was holding the establishment to the same standard as it's sister east end location, Papillon on the Park. Unfortunately, the downtown location can't even compare.

The Galette Florentine was crunchy, not airy or light at all. There was but a whisper of cheese and béchamel in the centre. All around the edges, it was just folded, dried out overcooked crepe.

The onion soup at the park location has this wonderful light quality with a thin, wafer-like cheese topping. This location provides a soup that is thick with far too much bread and cheese.

The service was like molasses. I had to flag down our server a few times, despite the fact that there were only ten or so tables occupied. There were at least three servers, so I'm not sure why it was so difficult getting service!

I wouldn't recommend this location but I still maintain that Papillon on the Park is fabulous! 

And I probably won't visit this location again. It's a shame considering I really like the ambience and they have really good drink specials.

Merci.
