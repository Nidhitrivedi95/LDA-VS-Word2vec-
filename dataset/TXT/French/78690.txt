ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug Low quality food and horrible service. Never eating here again. Worst $50 spent in my life AND that didn't even include drinks. Food took FOREVER to come to table, even though we ordered very simple entrees. The server didn't check on us ONCE. We asked for something TWICE and never got it. First time we leave without adding a tip.
