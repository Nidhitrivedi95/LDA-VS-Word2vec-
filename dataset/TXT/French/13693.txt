Well, after Yelp HQ said I need to review my choice of words, I am doing that here.

This place took over a half hour to serve us our salads - how long does it take to do that? It was a slow time and there were hardly any customers around. And the server never came around to fill our waters. Napkins weren't provided, and neither were we given knives to spread butter on our bread. The french onion soup was awful - it was way too salty, which basically made it inedible. One good thing was the saffron soup with mussels. That was delicious, but all the bads far outweighed the goods.

Like I said before, this place is bad. Do not go here. There is a legendary and popular place just across the street called Olive and Gourmando's that always has a long line of waiting customers. We initially wanted to go there but opted for Les Pyreness because there was no wait. Well, that's what we get. When there are few people around it's an indication that maybe that place doesn't have good food or service. That was indeed the case.

Go to O+G and I promise you you'll find the wait will have been worth it.
