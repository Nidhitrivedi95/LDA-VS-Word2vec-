O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q I love this place so much.  The ambiance, decor and service are luxurious.  I am always amazed with the service - impeccable is the word.  They are on top of it and attentive, without hovering, polite, quiet, and charming.  One of my favorite things to experience here is the "fromages" course.  They have an beautiful cheese menu that you may order a selection from and they give you some wonderful accouterments, such as honeycomb, fig compote and soft breads.  Last time I visited we had our server pick a selection for us based off our interests and he did a fabulous job, it was such a fun experience.  

The french onion soup is the best I have had anywhere and their croque monsieur is to die for.  I have attended lunch several times, and I have appreciated the fact that the restaurant was not loud or boisterous and not too packed.  It is always a pleasure to eat at Morels...
