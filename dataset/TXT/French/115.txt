I only really got a little taste of this place but it is definitely enough to get me to come back for a full experience. I arrived seeking a group of friends who already had a reservation. We were a large group for the place but all of our servers and waiters were amazing. Especially Par; he was funny, encouraging, accommodating, and entertaining. 

There were plenty of appetizers ordered for the table. A few of the ones I got to sample were the very savory chicken oysters, and the smoky mac and cheese. I know there were more but they were all delicious! I also had the Midnight Gaucho cocktail which was tasty and strong!

This was the first stop of many that night and it really started the night off right! I will definitely be back to try more of their delicious food and drinks. The ambiance was also something I really liked - classy and classic.
