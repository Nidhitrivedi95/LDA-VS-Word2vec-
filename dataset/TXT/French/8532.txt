4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw -Food: Very fresh and tasty with a great selection. I had the salmon kale salad which was perfect. My friend had the salmon which she loved and my hubby ordered the Beef Wellington which he enjoyed. We also loved the bread
-Prices: On the high side but worth it
-Location: Conveniently located in the middle of the strip and (Best part!) across the street from the Bellagio Fountains! If you're on the patio you can watch them which is awesome and adds to the classy ambiance
-Staff: The waiter was very helpful, quick, and friendly
-Overall: I will keep this on my list of places to eat at while on the strip
