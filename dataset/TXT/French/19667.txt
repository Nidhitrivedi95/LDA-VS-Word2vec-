aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw How is possible with a French name Bouchon have such a terrible croissant..??!
Should have believed  the Yelper who wrote that the pastries were staled and the bakery wasn't good. We bought two croissants at 10:45am, one was almond the other was apple. Those were probably the worst croissants we ever had. They were so dry that they were coming apart like a crumbling cookie. That's just unacceptable for the name and the location. We didn't complain and didn't return them but probably should have... one bite and in the trash they go. 
Should have gone back to Jean Philippe Patisserie in Aria which had better selection and top of the line pastries. 
This review is for the bakery only.  I'm sure the restaurant is a lot better.... I hope.
