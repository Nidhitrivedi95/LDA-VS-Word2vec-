aaWhSHpsE285eaSTzDxAMA I love Bistro 185. I came here early in Restaurant Week, making my reservation through Open Table. The restaurant is super easy to locate, right off the Shoreway & 185th. The interior is a little dated but don't let that deter you.

The service is spot on, the wait staff is extremely nice and helpful. The food, oh the food, it is so delicious. I had a Coquille St. Jacques (essentially scallops and shrimp in delicious cheese) as my first course, Pecan crusted fish with tempura vegetables and mashed sweet potatoes as my second, and the best key lime pie I have had in ages. My dining partner had a salad, some red meat and an amazingly delicious cheesecake (because we went so long ago I can't recall what she ate specifically). Both of us were so happy with our meals and we took most of it home to enjoy

We shared a bottle of sauvignon blanc.

This place is top notch. Their portions are extremely generous, that coupled with attentive workers left us satiated all the way through. 

Great work!
