jrwRDE-QhvDGHLXaTMSJyA Found this place while on a day trip to Charlotte. Kinda odd, never
encountered a Spanish tapas/Italian bistro before. The first page of the menu is all tapas, divided into vegetarian, seafood, and meat, while the remaining pages were antipasti, pasta, and Italian entrees. 

We were brought a basket of bread and pesto that was pretty good, especially the focaccia and their take on breadsticks. We ordered the croquettas de pollo from the meat tapas menu, they came out in short order and were the highlight of the meal. I had their fusili toscano as my main dish, basically fusili pasta with sausage and a basil tomato sauce. It was good, but not outstanding. The BF had gnocchi in a
bolognese sauce, also good, but not jaw dropping. 

I think on a return trip I'd stick to the tapas, instead of venturing onto the Italian side of the menu. 

Tapas 4/5
Italian 3/5
