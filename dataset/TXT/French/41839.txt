KRgTdfs4oVFUcATMfAoR4A I just went there for my dad's birthday. He's not so fond of "wierd foods" as he would probably say it.

 We actually tried the Tuesday and Wednesday special (6 tapas for 23$) and HE LOVED IT! We had some arranchini (exquisitly moist and flavourful), the lobster raviolli (to die for), the steak was well cooked, but a bit too salty to my taste, the coconut shrimps were well balanced, the portuguese chicken was tender and well seasoned, some foie gras en chiffonnade (great texture)...

I don't remember all we got, since the special requires everyone at the table to take the special if you want it, so we had 18 plates total (with some we took 2 or 3 of)...

2nd time around for me and I'll definitely come back there again.
