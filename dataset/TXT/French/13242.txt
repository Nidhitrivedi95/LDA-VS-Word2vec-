4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Again, had a table for 8. No problems at all, waitress even split up the check. I had a cheeseburger and it was delicious!!! My wife had steak with the roquefort butter and it was also Amazing. The creamed cauliflower was very good as well. Our table was inside because of the large party. I will eat here again for sure, very good and I'd like to sit on the patio.
