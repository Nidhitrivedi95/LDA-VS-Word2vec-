rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A My husband and I came to Las Vegas recently and ate breakfast here and it was the best meal that we had on our trip. In reflection, we should've eaten here every day. All the touches are awesome. The bread is really great the jam , a cherry loveliness, really great it's those things that make it so nice.  My husband had the eggs plus you get a whole bunch of other things with it. It turns out you can swap those things with other things on the menu. So we were able to customize our order that fit within the price that was on the menu. I had the salmon eggs Benedict. This isn't something I would normally order, but the ladies at the front desk said that this was their favorite. So I gave it a shot. It wouldn't be on their menu if it wasn't great, right? And it was awesome. I would definitely order that again!
