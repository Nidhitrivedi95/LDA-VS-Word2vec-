xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g We came here for lunch and a view of the strip.  There's not much of a weekday lunch crowd and getting a nice table with a view of the strip, Bellagio, and Caesars' Palace was easy.  I had a nice $16 burger that was cooked medium rare as requested.  Wife had baked vegetable crepes for $17.  Food was ok, but you're really paying for the view.   They also served complimentary bread puffs and a nice pistachio pudding.   Having recently gone to the Hancock's 95th floor Signature Room, I thought we might be going to the top of the Eiffel Tower, but this place is like at the 5th floor elevation.  Makes sense - they wouldn't have a whole lot of tables at the top of that skinny tower!
