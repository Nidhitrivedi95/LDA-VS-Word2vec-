8_cTFNIWFiDqBQ8MyorQEA My roommate and I were lucky enough to score Easter Sunday brunch reservations at Ma'tine. The woody and homey feel of the decor was a perfect start to our early brunch. Our Americanos came with tiny pots of steamed milk on the side -- A nice little touch. To eat, we shared two plates: 

1. Braised lamb with parsnips, arugula salad and a fried egg
2. Saucisse Morteau with a thick piece of bacon, sweet potato and a fried egg

The lamb was incredibly tender, though we both agreed that the plate itself could have almost been a lunch or dinner option. The saucisse morteau, on the other hand, was the perfect, upgraded, classier version of your classic eggs with bacon and sausage -- Highly recommended. 

At the end of our meal, we were asked to pay our bill at the front of the restaurant where there was a WIDE assortment of baked goods (danishes, croissants, brownies, small cakes etc.). I'd definitely recommend Ma'tine for brunch, especially if they are willing to take reservations on normal days!
