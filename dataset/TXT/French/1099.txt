_eNeiqWPt1MPLFF6DEIJeA I got the asian chicken and waffles. Might be one of the oddest things i have ever eaten. Theres A Lot going on.. Vegetables, strange tasting waffles, maple syrup very peppery shredded chicken and  some other type of meat, not sure what it is. The whole thing is rather spicy and just strange. I still cant decide if i liked it or not lol i dont think i would get this again but i will probably try something else next time
