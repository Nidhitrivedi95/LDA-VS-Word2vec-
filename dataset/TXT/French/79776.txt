zqNgwQjj0_XAll-neGikIw I love this place! I have eaten here for breakfast, dinner, and many a pastry. The quality of the food is EXCELLENT. I am a pastry snob and this place is delicious. When we ate dinner here, I had a chocolate tart at the end and I'm still thinking about it months later. For dinner, you bring your own wine, so note that if you're doing dinner. The service is almost always great. The owners are super friendly when we bring our kids in for breakfast (they have kids of their own). Great place. The only downside is location, next to a stinky subway. C'est la vie!
