4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I chose to take us here for breakfast after seeing that this restaurant got a high overall rating. Make sure to get a table on the patio for the view and people watching! Even if it's really hot outside you won't really feel it because of the a/c from the restaurant.

We arrived around 10 am and were seated promptly. The server was efficient and friendly during our stay. That morning we ordered the eggs benedict, smoked salmon eggs benedict, chocolate croissant (pain au chocolat), two mimosa's, and an orange juice. It didn't take very long for our food and drinks to arrive at our table. The eggs benedict were delicious! The mimosa's were quite expensive at $11.50 USD whereas we can get them for about $5 in Canada. Our server didn't charge us for the orange juice as she assumed we would use it for our mimosa's.

Besides the pricey mimosa's we would definitely return on our next visit to Vegas.
