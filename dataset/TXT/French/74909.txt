xYy54Y2VTBAG5k7WJcaH4A This restaurant is phenomenal. The food was excellent. We had the mussels for an appetizer, I had the fish special with spinach and mushroom ravioli, and finished the an apple tart for dessert. It is a tiny restaurant and a little loud, but the food was top notch and so was the service.
