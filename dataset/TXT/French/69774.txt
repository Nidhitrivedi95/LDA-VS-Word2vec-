WOd8tWsh2Yt_osHv-ngx_w Food was delicious and portion sizes enormous . We tried the breakfast poutine and loved it .. also fresh fruit smoothies are highly recommended .. just get them straight thou , barely tasted the shot of rum I added on . Paid Parking is available on the streets and customer service was great !
