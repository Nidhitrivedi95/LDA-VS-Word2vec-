oPGUbqBpHNZvVu9gAFJbMQ I go over there practically every time I'm in Montreal and have never been disappointed. From the escargots to the rack of lamb by way of the "Pate de Foie". One of the best spots in Montreal. Also ask Chris for his expression shots you'll be ready for the rest of the evening in Montreal!
