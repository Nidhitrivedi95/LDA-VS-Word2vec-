Y3e_rfMxAPFWI03ZgnpPxg I had a very good experience here. The food was good, the price was good (£15 for two courses) and the general ambiance was also very good. 
It was actually a set Christmas menu which could make the review redundant but it was actually a good barometer for quality. I had a fish cake starter with a lemon and chive mayo which was delicious and crisp followed by a turkey roast which wasn't too stodgy, it had a nice light jus with a spicy cranberry sauce. The house wine was also very good! Compared to other French eateries in Edinburgh I would say this place is less pretentious and relaxed, it's decently priced and it's centrally located. I will go back!
