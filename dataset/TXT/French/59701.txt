 The building itself is beautiful and so I'm sure the Dome doesn't fail to impress the rest of the year either. If caught in the after-work rush, this place can be busy and so you're not guaranteed a seat however the crowd provides an atmosphere. It ain't cheap, but worth it for a special occasion.
