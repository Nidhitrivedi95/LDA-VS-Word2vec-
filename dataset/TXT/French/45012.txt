mT8Ej8sKFJoIa5G0Vl4AKA Arrived close to 8pm and while the restaurant was full, there was no wait for a table for two. It's a good thing we knew what we wanted, however, as the only available menus were en français. I have a feeling this was due to the high occupancy of the restaurant as we've had English menus at this restaurant previously. 

We were served quickly, our waiter was polite and efficient.  I ordered a diet Pepsi that was served in a very small glass. If I received a number of refills, that wouldn't have been a problem, but my empty glass was simply whisked away and no refills provided. For $2.95 that's pretty unacceptable. 

The saving grace for this restaurant will always be is chicken tenders. I've declared them the world's best to anyone who will listen.  They are unique in their heavily applied, yet light and fluffy batter. The actual chicken is tender and juicy and I'm a fan of the accompanying barbecue sauce. 

Nobody went the extra mile as far as service is concerned. Very mechanical, no concern on refills, etc. This isn't to say the service was bad, it just wasn't great.  But if you order the chicken tender platter you shouldn't be disappointed. Those alone yield an extra star from me.
