bMiyGPaMqF0svjseW1UR_g I have been here several times, and overall the food was good... I would have given this restaurant 4 stars if it weren't for the fact that my last time there (we brought a fairly large group), everyone got sick!

the Mac & Cheese, Foie Gras, Beef tartar, and Shepherds pie were all standout dishes.

unfortunately, the whole food poisoning thing keeps me from recommending this place...
