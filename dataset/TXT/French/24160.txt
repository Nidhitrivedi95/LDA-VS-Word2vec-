cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg It was good enough for Anthony Bourdain, so it had to be good enough for us, right?

RIGHT.

Took my boyfriend here for his birthday dinner and because we love good food and don't mind splurging for it. We heard this place was one of the best in Montreal, and Bourdain praised it on his travel show, No Reservations. We HAD to try it.

Every single thing was insanely delicious, from the cubed foie gras starter to the "Duck in a Can" and buffalo tartare entrees to the espresso and creme brulee for dessert. Not a word was said as every tiny morsel was savored in complete ecstasy by us both. it was quite honestly the best meal we have ever had. Seriously.

Ever since our brush with culinary greatness, we joke around saying, "hey, we should totally jump on a plane right now and eat at Au Pied!!!" but seriously, we would actually do it if we had the funds. Fly to Montreal, eat, fly back. That's all we'd ever need.
