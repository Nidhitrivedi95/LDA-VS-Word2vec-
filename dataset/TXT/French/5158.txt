3FlWR_osNPb8dcqLgHebHw Been here twice. First time had their quiche and it was really good. The second time I had the steak and frites medium rare. It was a little under done but nothing that a microwave couldn't fix. The fries were crispy homecut. Had the cheese cake for dessert and it was not as thick as typical hers cake and wasn't overly sweet which I appreciated. I would definitely come back!
