4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Sunday brunch and it was pretty packed. Had a spectacular view of the Bellagio fountains. We had called prior for reservations and still had to be waited to be seated. The menu was pretty basic: crepes, egg Benedict, pancakes, waffles, and some not so "breakfast" items like onion soup. 
There was a Sunday Bloody Mary special and the bar was fantastic. 
I personally ordered the egg white and turkey omelette. It came with toast and potatoes. The potatoes were way too buttery and the omelette was at most basic but deliciously combined with avocados and tomatoes.
