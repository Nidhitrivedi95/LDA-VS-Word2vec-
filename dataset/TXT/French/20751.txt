AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw I've only been here for dessert -- it's worth a stop for that alone - you can skip the pricey dessert at another restaurant and pick up something at the counter here that'll be as good or better (and probably a bit cheaper, though maybe not by much).

The coffee macaron was featured on Food Network - and they're worth the trip.  I'm not a huge coffee fan, and I thought they were pretty tasty - nice meringue crunch on the outside, and a subtle coffee filling in the middle.  I won bonus points with the family when I presented these after returning home from a trip.

If I had to pick one thing though, it'd be the almond croissant - the best you'll find anywhere, with a crispy/flaky crust and an outstanding filling.
