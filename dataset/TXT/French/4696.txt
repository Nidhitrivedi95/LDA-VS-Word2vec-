The local is very lovely and French looking, all the products are nicely displayed and there is a very cute dinning room and a nice patio during the summer. 

They offer some delicious sandwiches and pastries and it does wonders for a nice and casual lunch. 

The food is so good that I would give it a 5 if it was not for the not so attentive service we received on our last visit. It's not the staff was impolite, but they just seemed not motivated to work.
