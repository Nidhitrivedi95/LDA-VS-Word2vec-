The breakfast menu is very simple fare, and everything is a la carte.  Choices include baguette, croissant, rillettes, slices of emmenthal cheese...  each range an average of around $2 - $4, and you just add up the ingredients you want on your breakfast plate.  If you're looking for creative combinations of eggs benedict, plates lavishly decorated with fruit or hangover-healing heavy doses of grease, this is not the place for you; potatoes don't even appear on the menu.  But the simple food they do they do very well.

If you're dining with a few others, I would suggest (as I will be doing next time) ordering plates of tomatoes, cheese and rillette to share along with your toast and eggs.  Otherwise, if you order it all for yourself, you'll be faced with the equivalent of one whole tomato, 6 slices of cheese for your modest - though perfect - slice of toasted baguette.

The fruit cup last saturday was especially nice - a pretty verrine of strawberries, oranges and grapefruit.

On a Saturday morning, it was packed; reservations are strongly recommended.
