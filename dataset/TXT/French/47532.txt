O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q Will not go back. Ordered the "feature" bone in filet and 1/2 pound of king crab legs. Also ordered the prawn cocktail. The server forgot the prawn. My filet came with a single crab claw. I asked the server if that was supposed to be my crab legs. He didn't reply but instead a manager delivered two more claws. The manager told me they had run out of crab legs a day or two ago. I tried the claws. Not good! The steak was excellent. The prawn finally showed up. Not good at all. Very disappointed.
