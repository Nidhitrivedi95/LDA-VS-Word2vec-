yVNaMEBUslR_7GbFhurJEg We went to H4C for brunch and it was delicious! All the dishes looked and tasted great (eggs benedict dishes, donuts and brioche, coffee/tea). Presentation was lovely and the service was gracious. The tables are close together, but the room is beautiful and has lots of natural light. There was a bit of an issue with timing of the service (too fast) but otherwise all was excellent. This is a pricey brunch ($18-25 for dishes, which don't include coffee or tea which is $3.50 and up) and mostly worth it, although the donut/brioche seemed slightly overpriced at $13, although delicious. We paid $85 + tip for 2 people. I'll be back for special occasions. Great job H4C!
