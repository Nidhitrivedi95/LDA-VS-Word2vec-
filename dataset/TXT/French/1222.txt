_O12nlv3sISPfiNAQVLM4Q Our visit to this restaurant has been the only black smudge on our trip to Montreal. We had been recommended this place by our hotel. 

The food was extremely low quality. I got a steak which was so clearly frozen and of poor quality that I could I gotten it at a diner in Florida for $6.50. Everything seemed to have been frozen at some point and was way way way overpriced for the poor quality. There was weird techno music playing in the background. 

On top of it, I had ordered off a set menu, but then was charged regular menu price. When I pointed it out to the waiter, he claimed I had said the wrong thing in French. I had clearly pointed to the set menu on the English side of the menu when I ordered. But the way he responded to me when I raised it to him left me somehow apologizing to him for the mistake. The waiter served to make me embarrassed and then bitter that I was overcharged. This is the only time I've been made to feel unwelcome as a tourist during my time in Montreal. 

The only redeeming quality was the small glass of kir and champagne they offered women upon being seated. 

Our bill came to $90 and was the quality of a $15 diner. 

Definitely avoid it here.
