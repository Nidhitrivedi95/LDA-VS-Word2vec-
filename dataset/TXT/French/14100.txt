58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw Breakfast in Montreal!! the lineup is out the door and the wait was about 45 min. 

after a big mug of latte, i feel a bit more relaxed and less grumpy. For four people, we ordered the crepe meal, salmon meal, and a egg benedict meal ( the actual names are in french, i have no idea) and that was quite enough. Our waitress was helpful and she was happy to help us out. Everything was good except the salmon cake and salmon egg - it was a bit fishy, did it come from a can? I wasn't liking my fishy smelly egg thingy in the kremlin - all the other foods were good. Cute decor, great crowd, packed restaurant. I really enjoyed  my meal here. I thought I'd have enough stomach space for a croissant in the end.. all the baked goods look so amazing at the entrance. Maybe i'll come again in the future just for the baked goods!

free wi-fi, that's always a bonus!
