I went with a group of 6 and for appetizers we had the arugula salad, beef pate, baked oysters and the special, which was a chestnut pasta. Everything was absolutely sublime. The food was presented and described with care and each individual flavour came together in an amazing way.

For mains, I had the seafood medley! which came with salmon, scallops, crab cakes, clams and ravioli. Amaze. We also had the steak, and most of our party had the lobster special. 

Though it's on the expensive side, it is worth it.
