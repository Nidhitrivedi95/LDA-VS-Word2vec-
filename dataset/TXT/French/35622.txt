htQgj-ANQpZGpIpkkrEmyQ Saw the great reviews and decided to try this place since its close to home.  Had the Osyter Po'Boa for starter, the bao was nicely fried and the osyter was a great pairing with the cabbage. I had the Chicken and Waffles which was lightly battered and the waffles werw soft with a light drizzle of syrup. The hubs had the King Osyter Steak which was cooked prefectly and had a great sauce. Would def recommend this place if you want to try something new and great to support small businesses.
