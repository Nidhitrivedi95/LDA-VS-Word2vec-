4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Food here is average and below my expectations. Most of the time i agree with the ratings on yelp reviews but this time I don't think this place is 4 stars. 

First of all I think the food here is more "American" than "French". Maybe it's a different type of French styled food I haven't tried but I've been to several French restaurants and their flavors are more complex and rich. Which leads me to the second reason why this place is average. 

Food here is pretty plain. There is nothing fancy or great about their flavors. We ordered steak frites, scallop for appetizer, and the cod with eggplants. Sure their steaks, cod, and scallop were tender and juicy but other than that there is nothing else good about it. 

Service was very good and their food portions are pretty huge. This is the second place the food disappointed me in Vegas based on Yelp reviews.
