t1mR_Zff6Dqv1TueE2JLEA First let's talk about food. As far as taste, the food was fine, edible but nothing to write home about. 

We ordered the Chèvre Brûlée appetizer, which consisted of a thin sliver of goat cheese with port de cassis jam on a tiny, overly-toasted crostini. It was difficult to cut because of the hard cracker, and the cheese didn't appear baked in the least. However, the taste was nice, like cheesecake. It was shocking that such a ridiculously tiny portion would cost us an extra four dollars. Sadly, this was actually the best part of our meal.  

For our main dish, we ordered the Chickpea Tagine, a Moroccan stew. It was a simple dish of chickpeas in gravy accompanied by warm, buttered pita. This is something that I could whip up at home in a few minutes and although the menu announced a number of spices, the dish was bland. We added some amazing house-made Harissa hot sauce and that made the dish passable. 

For dessert, we ordered the Decadent Chocolate tart. It was chocolate-y, not too sweet and nothing special. The Creme Brûlée, however, was very good. 

Now let's talk about the show. Two belly dancers appeared for two songs. They did a few twirls and shimmies before dancing with the dinner guests. The dancers were sweet and it was fun to dance with them but this was not high quality entertainment worthy of its hefty price tag. 

The three-course prix fixe meal and belly dancing cost us 55$ per person. My boyfriend and I shared one three-course meal plus a 37$ bottle of wine plus an extra 4$ for the "premium" goat cheese. This evening cost us 130$ with tax and tip. 

We estimate that food and wine would have cost us 70$ at another restaurant of equivalent or better quality. That leaves us with 60$ for entertainment. For 30$ pp, we could definitely have seen a professionally choreographed show elsewhere with more than two dancers. 

Sultan's Tent is overpriced in relation to quality and entertainment. Never again.
