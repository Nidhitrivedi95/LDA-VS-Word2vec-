9n6BBipidP5Eyb9xGrS0Ww GLUTEN FREE Crepes!!!! Everything here is gluten free and is absolutely delicious. OMG best crepes of my life. My boyfriend said they didn't taste GF and I have to agree with him. The customer service here is excellent, it's the kind of place where you make friends with the wait staff, but it's a cute little cart in the Jean Talon Market. If you are in Montreal and looking for a gluten free lunch, come here, you won't regret it!!!!!
