jSfnItqaOnEp2nenVF7fCg I would probably give this place 2.5 stars.  There were a few service hiccups that do not seem consistent with the atmosphere they're obviously seeking.  Our main entrees were brought when my husband was still eating his appetizer causing us to scramble to find room for all of the dishes.  My husband's appetizer dish (which was a long rectangular dish and not at all inconspicuous) sat ON the table until dessert dishes were cleared.  Space is at a premium here (so much so that two of our dining companions were bumped by neighboring diners and food had to be passed down the tables as the servers couldn't get to the people at the end).  It also seemed rather expensive.  

The food was okay.  My salad wasn't tossed terribly well and despite the description that mentioned candied walnuts, I think I located exactly one.  My filet was quality and cooked well but someone was rather heavy-handed with the demiglace in the kitchen.  My aunt's filet was oversauced as well.  It probably wouldn't have been an issue except it was salty.  (And I LOVE salt so me describing something as salty should tell you something.)  

The bread pudding was delicious although the blueberries were completely drowned out by the caramel sauce.

Overall...  eh.
