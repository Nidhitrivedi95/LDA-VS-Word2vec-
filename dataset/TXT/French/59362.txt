rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w Worst fine dining experience ever! I'm a local and love to try all the resteraunts Las Vegas has to offer. The service was terrible and the food just barely adequate. The waiter said the souffle took 10-15 minutes, 45 minutes later the over cooked souffle arrived. Waited 20 minutes for our coffee. Waited 45 minutes between courses. You get the picture! Won't go back! Wouldn't recommend! 

I gave it 1 star because it's a pretty room.
