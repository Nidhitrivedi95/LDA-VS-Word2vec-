6fPQJq4f_yiq1NHn0fd11Q These were quite possibly the best crepes I've ever had. Honestly, I can't say I've ever been a crepe lover, but I'd eat them every day if they came from here. I got the Soliel and asked them to add ham. Yes, it was $9, but it was too much for one person to eat in one sitting (in my opinion). So, given that you can get two meals for the price of one, I think it's totally worth it.
