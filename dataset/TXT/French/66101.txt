ufwkkMd9yr9cFU1R5ONArg My coworker and I were trying to figure out what to have for lunch until our heart for mexican food kicked in. I have never tried Hvuenos before so I figured, why not?!
I ordered the Chicken tacos with lettuce instead of tomatoes. They were VERY good. 
Hit the spot. My only complai is I wish there was more filling inside the tacos. Besides that it was really good. My coworker ordered one of the sandwiches and loved it. I would love to go back and try their eggs benny sometime!
