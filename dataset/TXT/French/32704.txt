h_NnD6TPuhIFy2ZdqOlUgQ I actually found this place on a fluke.  I stopped by the good year to get my tires re inflated with nitrogen and was hungry and did a quick yelp search and saw this place.  

I walked in and was NOT impressed.  LOL  It just looked like your average gas station store until you walked in further and started to really look around.  They have the Milka brand chocolates from Europe.  A friend of mine introduced them to me and I have been in love ever since.  Now I have a quick spot to get them.  Yay!!  Yummy in my tummy!  =)

Sandwiches are all made with Boar's Head Meat and Cheese!  And they are not shy about piling on the meat.  I've had the sandwiches on their ciabatta and normal hoagie bread and both a awesome!  The ciabatta had a good crust and the hoagie had a great chew throughout.  They were both great compliments to the meat.  (5/5) for both sandwiches.  

Why the -1 star?  They have baklava which I LOVE but it was not your traditional one which they did not specify and it was soupy. . .and it was ok but not what I was expecting.  So that was -.5.  Now the other -.5 was for this Kreatopita kind of thing.  They called it something else but it was ground meat wrapped up in phyllo.  The phyllo was slightly still raw in the center.  =(  I was able to bake it more and it was delicious BUT they should make sure that all their pastries are full baked before selling it to their customers.  

Other then that, they did have a nice selections of other european style pastries and eurpean style goodies.  I will definitely be back to get another sandwich and to do a little shopping.  =)
