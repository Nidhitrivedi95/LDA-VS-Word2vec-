kKC7UTcHZM3zLfT97x3msg Frank's Kitchen has always been one of my favorite restaurants in Toronto. I first went here since they were newly opened and have been re-visiting since then because of how delicious the food here are. One my second latest visit, I was lucky to finally get to try Frank's infamous 16 courses tasting menu and I must tell you that I was totally blown away. All the courses came out at a perfect pace and everything was amazing. I ordered it with wine pairings and it was definitely worth every dollar spent. 

On my latest visit there, I opted for the a la carte menu. I ordered the deep fried gnocchi in gorgonzola cream sauce. I was intrigued by the name and was curious as to how this would taste like. It turned out amazing and I was thankful that I ordered it. For the mains, I opted for the scallop bourguignon and Aged beef striploin with truffles. The scallops were cooked to perfection, but the beef was not cooked right. I ordered medium rare but it came out a little overcooked. Furthermore, I found the meat to have a very weird texture instead, it could because the knife wasn't sharp enough and caused the meat to fall apart inside. But it felt it was also pretty dry inside and a little off. Nevertheless, the meal was amazing overall and I would definitely come back for another visit and give this place another chance!
