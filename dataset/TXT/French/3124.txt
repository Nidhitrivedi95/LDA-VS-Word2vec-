1aj4TG0eFq6NaPBKk6bK7Q The staff was friendly and inviting. Their service was good. Prices are a little high for what they are serving but the food is good!! Decor was really nice and they had good-vibe music playing. I wasn't able to try any deserts but I definitely will be back. Glad I live really close by but their hours are a little confusing. They have breakfast brunch and dinner hours but are closed during certain hours but open to serve..something? It was extremely confusing.
