oS96aJIHFWcFAlGHKKXjaw Came to Pittsburgh for a visit and a friend took us here. Wow, everything was amazing in this cute little shop. I ordered a French macroon sandwich (that's right) filled with custard and raspberries that was perfect. My friends ordered some type of cinnamon roll and a cream puff. Everything was beautifully crafted and well balanced. We arrived near the end of the day, so lots of their breads were sold out, so make sure you arrive earlier in the day for the best selection.
