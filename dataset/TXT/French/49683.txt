or4UVDjXEEjze3wNPjoAZA I had a party of approximately 15 people out in the garden area. Honestly probably a nightmare table to take care of because my friends tend to be high maintenance but our server handled everything well! The menu was difficult to read so I recommend looking at images on Yelp first!! In the end everything was delicious and the ambience was amazing.. my only complaint is that one of their staff members was harassing us. When we sat down he was going on saying how he just turned 18 and honestly stayed way up in our personal space throughout the experience making some of my friends uncomfortable
