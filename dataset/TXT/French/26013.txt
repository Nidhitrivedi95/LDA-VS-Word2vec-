d482l58ho0_IMdFkXX1F5Q Another NYC coffee shop pretending to be something special. And why are you playing rock music? No, really. Why? Food came out way too fast. Local chef must have fallen asleep while salting the food and continued to keep shaking while he was sleepwalking. Las Vegas continues to fool the people, not only about entertainment, but now food. When did food become a celebrity? This is really not worth the money. Take it from a fan of Daniel's NYC places. You just can't expand this way.  The food also came out way too fast. The sever saw that I still had my soup. He stood next to me with my main dish, expecting what? He asked to remove the soup, but made no attempt to disappear and return. I let him remove the soup. No sense two of us  being unhappy.....
