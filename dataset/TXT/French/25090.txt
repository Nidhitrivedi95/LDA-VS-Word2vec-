Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA I attended a group dinner here on Thursday night.  First of all the view is absolutely breathtaking, well worth the trip up 68 stories.  The food is excellent, varied and complex dishes mostly focusing on standard steakhouse style Americana. We started with a mix of starters, all were amazing but notable were the Gnocci, light and fluffy in an edamame puree, really something.  I had the dry aged fillet, it was fine and cooked perfectly which actually shocked me!  Desert looked amazing as well, everyone seemed to love what they got.  Here's the problem, the wait staff are horrible.  I mean they screwed everything up, it took like 15 minutes to get a drink and they kept disappearing.  You're in Vegas Mix, the hospitality capital of the world so pick it up a notch.
