The top tier in my list is strawberry shortcake (Fraiser) and the coffee cake. I don't think I'll be too adventurous anymore, since I usually end up not liking something rather than finding a new favorite (the latest disappointments being Tira Misu and Mint Chocolate Cake), but I at least commend them for trying new things.
