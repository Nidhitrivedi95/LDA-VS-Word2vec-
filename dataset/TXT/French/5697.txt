3jKUbhGSjFTv5jZ0wnW0xA Les Deux Gamins is a cozy bright restaurant that makes dining intimate but casual. The service was attentive and though we made no reservations, they didn't rush us since we came before 6pm. 

We had the duck confit and charcuterie/cheese plate. Really loved the split pea mash/puree with the duck, and the charcuterie platter had a variety of meats cheeses and pickles. 

We had creme brulee for dessert; though it was creamy and the texture was good, the top was too thick for our preference, and it was not consistently "carameled". There were lots of chunky white sugar that they missed when they torched the topping.
