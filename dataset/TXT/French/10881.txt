4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I'm harder on the so called finer dining restaurants.  I expect perfection for the premium price.  

The waiter was far below par.  The main menu said ask for our gluten free menu, we did.  The guy literally said, "I'd have to go to the front to get it."  THEN GO GET IT!  I'm not sure if it was a gag or what, but I felt like a nuisance as opposed to a guest.

The food was good.  I had a filet, well cooked, needed salt.  Wife had chicken that was well prepared.

We dined on a night in which a marathon was passing on the main strip.  The people and the Bellagio fountain made for great ambiance, combined with good food, just let down by the wait staff.
