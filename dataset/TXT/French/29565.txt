f4vb5tv60WaBcwzRhKpANA I'm so rarely on this side of town. It's like another world to me. So when my husband and I were in the area I jumped at the chance to try a new place. I checked my Yelp app and saw that Nanny's was right around the corner from where we were. 

Nanny's is a French cafe. They have a small menu of sandwiches, paninis, salads, and omelets. Plus, they had some beautiful looking pastries. After perusing the menu Joel ordered the salami sandwich and I had the Belgian panini. 

Joel's sandwich came on a huge piece of baguette. It had salami, cheese, and pickles. Plus, it had a side salad with romaine lettuce, tomatoes, eggs, and topped with ranch dressing. He said it was good, but nothing we couldn't make at home. My Belgian panini was so large it took up most of my plate. It was hot, toasty and loaded with ham and gouda cheese all melted together. Very tasty and crunchy! 

The staff was so friendly and helpful. I love locally owned business. The panini is definitely worth stopping in for. They have many different versions that all sound delicious. Next time I'm going to try their pretty pastries. If your in the area check out this quaint cafe for brunch or lunch or even a snack!
