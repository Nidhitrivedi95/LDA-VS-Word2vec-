hzyvL2v97xLzLbLXcdi1uw Crepes are my favorite breakfast choice, and I have to say, Cafe Moulin has the best crepes I've ever had!! Cafe moulin offers so many different choices of crepes that you will definitely find one that you love. The "Super Belgium" is my favorite, which is made with cookie spread in the middle. It's phenomenal!! The restaurant is small and cozy and service is fast! If you have the chance to get brunch in Pittsburgh, make sure you stop here!
