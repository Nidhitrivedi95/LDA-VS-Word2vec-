I ordered the roast chicken, something I never do in restaurants, because I'm afraid it will be dry.  I just needed something lighter that night.  This dish is far from what I expected.  It was wonderfully juicy and tender with an almost sweet sauce that just brought the dish together.  

Our waiter was friendly and chatty.  I know nothing about wines, but  we were celebrating our anniversary, so I decided to have a glass.  I described to him what I like and he brought me a glass of liquid heaven.  WOW.  I enjoyed it so much, I asked him to write down the name for me.   He even brought me the bottle to show me what it looked like so I could find it in the store.  Very nice.

It's a beautiful restaurant with partial views of the elaborate pool area.  Looks almost like the living room of a chateau transformed into a restaurant.  The decor is very unique, but it's a bit stuffy - like you're afraid to laugh too loudly when you're there.  Or if you drop your fork, you almost want to apologize for the noise.  The food is good, and I do recommend it, but it's more of a private, special occasion type place.
