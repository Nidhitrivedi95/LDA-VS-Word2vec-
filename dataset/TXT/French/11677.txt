4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Terrible service. Very disappointed because I had heard great things. Made a reservation for 745 but still had to wait for 35 mins. Hostess was extremely rude, her name Christina. I was talking to her and she was purposely looking over me and not responding. Not a good start to dinner and not impressed with customer service.
