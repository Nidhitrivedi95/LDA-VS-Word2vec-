SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA Dined on the terrace on a Monday evening.  We started with oysters on the half shell (with mingnonette sauce) and Goat cheese and herb tart. They were both wonderful served on a warm night with a crisp white Bordeaux.  The tart was luscious and savory but very delicate leaving plenty of room for entrees and a desert.  We ordered the ROASTED TROUT WITH ALMOND CRUST and the ROASTED COD
with spätzle, sauerkraut, crème fraîche and cornichon aioli  the latter a far more elegant and  delicious choice.   
The cofe au lait was superb.  My dinner companion and I split an ample sized Napoleon for dessert.   The service was amicable.
