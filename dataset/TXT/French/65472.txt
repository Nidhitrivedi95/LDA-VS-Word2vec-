U1LB3sRMGTu_h7Sf9QdNoA Ate here for breakfast because it was right around the corner from where we were staying. We walked into this cute little french looking cafe and the food was great. Cafe ole' was up to the Parisian standard and the crepes were as well. We ordered a savory crepe consisting of over medium eggs, brie, bacon and home fries it was delicious. I will definitely be returning.
