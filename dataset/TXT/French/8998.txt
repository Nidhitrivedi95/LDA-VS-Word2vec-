4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I liked this place so much we ate here twice! We went for lunch one day, and had to come back for breakfast the next! 

We ordered the croque monsieur for lunch. It was very good, and for only $12 it was well worth it! The frites were thin and crispy and highly addictive. 

For breakfast my boyfriend and I shared the blueberry french toast, and the pineapple waffles. Both were amazing! sweet, and very filling. 
They also have a make your own bloody mary bar wich was well worth the $11! 
I would highly recommend eating here, I know I will be back next time I go to vegas.
