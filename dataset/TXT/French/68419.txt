vLkKorA1gPS97Zj0_WKA0Q Ah, Twist.  We are so conflicted about you.  My boyfriend and I dined here on Thanksgiving eve.  We saw the menu ahead of time.  We saw the price.  We were excited about the seafood on the menu, as we're not huge fans of turkey. 

During our meal, we remarked on how different and experimental everything was.  And tasty.  And the portion sizes were...ok.  And everything was... good.  And slightly weird. But tasty.  

The desserts were the only serious disappointment.  My boyfriend described the dessert portions as insulting.  I was disappointed by the serious lack of chocolate.  I love chocolate.  Passion fruit isn't really my thing.  

In the end, we spent $450, which includes tip and two glasses of wine.  And we kind of regret it.  

The restaurant is absolutely gorgeous, and so peaceful and quiet.  A wonderful respite from the hustle and bustle of The Strip. The service was good.  Efficient but not obtrusive.  We actually had more of a rapport with the food runner, Louis, than anyone else.  Maybe our waiter was upset that we didn't order a $200 bottle of wine.  Whatever.  My boyfriend had a headache, and I wouldn't have finished a bottle on my own.

Everything was fine.  But nothing knocked our socks off.  

We love eating out.  I may even go so far as to call us "foodies".  The problem with Twist is, a year from now, I doubt I will be able to recall exactly what we ate.   I probably will be able to describe the decor, but not the food.
I'm glad we went.  The view was amazing.  But for $450, the view shouldn't be my favorite part of the evening.
