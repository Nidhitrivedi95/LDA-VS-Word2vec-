uP3H5bcsiTXM0k0xQhRndg Got the Mac n' Cheese.

Ridged elbow macaroni topped with ham and light garnish.

This is a dish of intense truffle, cheese, and maple flavors. The flavor profile of this first hits with the floryness of the pasta, then you get notes of funky (in a good way) cheesiness, followed by a blend of maple and truffle aftertaste. These flavor are strong and do challenge pallettes unaccustomed to intensity, especially with truffles.

The plate is topped with ham. The best ham I've ever had. It's amazingly tender and hold it's smoky sweetness so well.

The sauce is smooth and strong.

My single qualm with this dish is with the doneness of the pasta. The elbow macaronis were slightly too chewy for me. The bite still felt like the pasta needed about 3-5 more minutes in boiling water. Execution of the pasta make a big difference in the overall quality of the dish. It's one of those things where I didn't want to be a snob and send the dish back, but the pasta was very clearly underdone.  This is a shame, too, because the rest of the dish was so good.
