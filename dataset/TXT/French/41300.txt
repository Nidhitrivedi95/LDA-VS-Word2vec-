kGOr_D-LNpgZ2M9N8TT4QQ I'm big on consuming food and drinks at the bar.. and they have a good looking bar and the bar staff is pretty attentive. I'm here a lot for the $1 oysters on Thurs.. make sure to ask for their wine vinaigrette that accompanies it.. they used to serve it with the oysters but now you have to ask for it.

Had the eggs benedict for brunch.. the food looked better instagrammed than it tasted. 

The one thing I really miss about the place- They used to have Veuve Clicquot nights.. Wish they would bring it back.
