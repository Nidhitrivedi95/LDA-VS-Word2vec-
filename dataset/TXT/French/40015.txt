K67pkQljTFTW_P-7xUQrFw Ok I would probably give this a 1 star based on food alone. They used to have an amazing gnocci but now have removed it from the menu (why???) so I got the fettuccine alfredo which was....... not good. honestly felt sick after eating it. Just not flavourful at all. So food is not so good, but where this place makes up for it is the experience, when you go with friends with one bottle of wine each really nothing beats that. It's better to go Sunday-Wednesday nights though as the pasta prices are nearly half off!!! It's crazy actually to think that they try to charge $17 for that awful fettuccine alfredo on weekends... absurd.
