xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g This was one of the best dinning experiences in my life. We took out a party of 10 and the service was just knock out. The room is really beautiful, especailly at night!. I first must add that I live in San Francisco and we have many great restaurantsthat I can compare it to. That being said I found the Eiffel tower to be better than Gary Danko, Masa's, postrio etc.

Their foie gras tourchon was amazing with a fig puree. Their take of Surf and turf: an 8oz fillet with an amazing crab crake was the best( the steak with so delicate and tender and flavorful). The potatoe gratin side was delicate, subtle, and bursting with flavor. The wine list is a knock out....from chateau margauxs to california pinots and everything in between...probably 500 different wines.

For dessert we had the souffles.....bannana , caramel, and chocolate...very good.

This restaurant is very expensive but I felt, as did the other 9 dinners, it was worth every penny. I highly recommend!!!
