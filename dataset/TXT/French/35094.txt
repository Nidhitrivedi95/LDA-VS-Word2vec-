HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw I expected more from a restaurant in Cosmopolitan. The oysters we ordered for appetizer was okay, nothing special. They were oysters you could get at a regular restaurant. The clams were pretty good though, great sauce and cooked perfectly. I would say the beet salad and king crab salad was pretty measly. I would not recommend sharing those. 
For entree we ordered lamb, duck confit, striped sea bass, and pork. The lamb, cooked medium rare, was pretty chewy and not very flavored. Duck confit seemed oily. The striped sea bass was the best out of four dishes because the skin was crispy and the fish was juicy. The pork was also not bad. Overall the meal was not very satisfying because all the portions were so small and the flavors were not to my liking.  It would have been fine if this was a tapas restaurant, but it wasn't. We ended up going to another restaurant to finish our meal. 
I may not have enjoyed the meal because I expected much more from a French restaurant and the food to be much more flavorful. However, I would give it another chance and try their other menu items.
