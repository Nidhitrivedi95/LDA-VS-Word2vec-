SFnrHuVFSNiondFVUBLJZQ Great location in Old Montreal and the old-world feel of the restaurant add to its charm. Service was not great, but aside from that the food was pretty good. There are some nice salad option which can be tough to find so if you're looking for some good greens this is a good location for you. Lots of sweet and savory crepes and fondue options.

I LOVED my Parisienne crepe which had apples, brie and of course some maple syrup. Many of the other crepes included cheese and some more cheese on top...I felt like my dinner option was sutto healthy.  Chocolate fondue is a must and one portion was very generous. Our dessert was accompanied by loads of fresh fruit, bits of crepe and marshmallow.
