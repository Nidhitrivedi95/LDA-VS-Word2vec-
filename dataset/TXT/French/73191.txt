XNvklghmapxOlCB-wGv_sA I went for my friend's birthday, and we were brought upstairs to a nice dining room. I couldn't find the menu and then I was told it's on the wall. So for starters, I couldn't even read the menu because the room was so dark so I just ended up getting what everyone else got: steakes frites. 
It came with a salad, it was fresh but it wasn't anything special. Giant pieces of lettuce with some sauce and 3 slices of onions on top.
The steak came, most people ended up getting the wrong sauce with their steak. Mine was really tender and the sauce was good, however it hardly came with vegetables and the all you can eat fries were so greasy they made me sick.
I then got a dessert, which was 3$ and was actually the best part of the entire meal. I was also really disappointed by the coffee I ordered too. It hardly tasted like coffee and was basically in a cup just a slight bit bigger than an espresso cup. I've had better coffee from McDonalds.

All in all, I don't think i'd ever go back there considering I still have no idea what is on their menu and I paid 40$ for a supper that I could have paid 20$ for and have a way better experience.
