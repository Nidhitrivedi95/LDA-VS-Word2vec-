SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA We've been wanting to try L'Albatros for a very long time and finally made it there on a busy Friday night. We didn't have a reservation but they were nice enough to find us a table.  I started with the French onion soup and it was delicious! My husband had potato soup and he also enjoyed it. We also both were very happy with our entrees.  I had chicken with leeks and mashed potatoes and he had a pork dish. We were too full for dessert but there were some great options on the menu and we will definitely save some room next time.
