U1LB3sRMGTu_h7Sf9QdNoA Great little escape away from the busy downtown while still being downtown! Tucked away in Clarence Sq, this place like many other Yelpers described is a hidden gem.

We were here at lunch time on a weekday and one thing to note is make reservations! The place was packed, but since we were only a party of 2, they managed to squeeze us in. We ordered the veggie quiche (~$11) and the smoked salmon crepe (~$17), a little pricier for lunch but well worth the price as they were both delicious.

The service was great even with just 2 servers in a packed restaurant, they managed to make it work. Can't wait to be back again in the patio season, as they also have a small patio outside.
