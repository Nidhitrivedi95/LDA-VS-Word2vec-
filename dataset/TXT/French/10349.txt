4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Love this place but check in today was less than normal. We had a reservation for the inside, but because it was so beautiful outside we decided to ask for out side seating, which we knew meant we were on a waiting list. Tiffany was less than polite and acted as if I were trying to get away with something. I realize it was a holiday weekend but that was over and today was a new day. Then we were seated on the railing and Sarah was our server. She took us to where we remembered. Great service friendly personality and watching the water show at night was just so very romantic and what we needed for our 20th anniversary thanks Sarah!!
