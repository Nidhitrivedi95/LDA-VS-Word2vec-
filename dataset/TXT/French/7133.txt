4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Really lackluster experience here. Upon entering, we were met by bored employees chatting with each other. One finally noticed us and guided us to our table. Seated, we were able to look around and check out the place. The place does the brasserie look pretty well, but is marred by music which has no relevance to the decor and menu.

Service is just okay and the food was sloppily prepared. My skate wing was barely pan sautéed (basically white with very little browning) and just past raw. Our salads were uninspired. 

While in the same category as Bouchon, it is compares poorly in every way. Head to the Venetian and go with Bouchon.
