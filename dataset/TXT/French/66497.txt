uP3H5bcsiTXM0k0xQhRndg We went here for our first dinner in Montreal. The waitress was so friendly! We had the Incredible Mac&Cheese as well as the Ultimate Experience. Both are wonderful! For dessert we had the Pudding Chomeur to get our first taste of maple syrup. Delicious! If we were staying longer than 4 days we would go again!
