D7CnTsm8SCmbQghz1ioPdw The disclaimer is that this is not a full review.  

The service was so odd, awkward and potentially drug-effected, that our party left after a single overly salted appetizer. The waitress was jangly, pushy, non-responsive to requests, telling us what we should eat instead of letting us select, telling us that we were required to order entrees and mains at the same time, even though the restaurant was empty. The hard sell and the instructions on how we need to order in a vacant restaurant was off-putting. Her clipped, abrupt manner seemed to be a result of a very bad day, some awful pre-work news, a handful of diet pills or that first line of biker's coke before service. What should have been a $140 dollar peaceful meal was a $40 20-minute countdown, making us eye the door and trying to finish before the next strange encounter with the server-from-speedville.

I would try it again if the front of house was a little more emotionally together and professional and the back of house was not so salty.

It seems like a very nice place. Perhaps this was a bad night. (That said, it was pretty strange and a little reminiscent of the aggressive homeless that were so ubiquitous in Old Montreal a decade ago.)
