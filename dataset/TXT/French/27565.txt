DJcvnN7BCiqOUAra35xYuA I was in town from Los Angeles for a business meeting.  This place was close to my hotel and I had a urge for Vietnamese. Coming from Los Angeles where we have high standards for Vietnamese food this place was pretty good.  A little pricey by LA standards for Vietnamese food but it's located downtown by all the hotels so I'm sure everything's a little more expensive in this area.  Nonetheless really happy I found this place. I had the pho tai and the spring rolls. They have a really interesting wide selection of rolls.  Did not get a chance to try their main entrées which did seem to look pretty good looking over at other people dining.  
They apparently have some really good happy hour specials which I missed because I came for a late dinner.  The happy hour ends at 6:30 PM.  
Would definitely come back to this place again if back in Phoenix.
