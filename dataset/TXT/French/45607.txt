mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q Michelin star French cuisine at its best, to be savored by taste, smell, and visual feast of culinary artistry as you sit at bar counter with great view of food prepared before your eyes. 

Foie gras parfait in parmesan foam is a delightful start to French flavors at its best. Beef tartare salad comes as flower art, topped quail egg in gold foil, complemented with powdery crisp fries and toast. Lobster spaghetti is nicely al dente and perfectly cooked lobster with firm outside and soft creamy goodness inside, best pasta i've tasted. 

Quail stuffed foie gras is tender with powerful flavor. Caramelized salmon fillet cooked medium rare comes with nice pink inside, topped with spectacular nameko mushrooms soft smooth as oysters. Potato puree is deliciously soft, light, creamy. 

For dessert, green chartreuse Souffle is perfectly risen with well baked firm golden top, smooth flat without crack. Dip a spoon into moist airy fluffy sweet melt-in-mouth heavenly delight. French press coffee complements sweet treats with strong robust roast, and comes enough for generous 2-cup refill. 

Sweet finish to meal with complimentary cake sampler, best is chocolate caramel cake with nuts that is wonderfully smooth chocolate with just-right-not-too-sweet caramel, balanced with fresh pecan. 

For $100+ pax, this is recommended elegant casual dinner date night sitting intimately side by side enjoying French Michelin culinary feast for the eyes, palate sensory delight, topped with exceptional attentive service.
