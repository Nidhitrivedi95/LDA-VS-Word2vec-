9ot8oInkYZTt6wkkGe__vQ We came last Sunday for Summerlicious brunch. The service was top notch, at least 4-5 different people "served" us. We had Croquette, Sea Bass and Ice Cream Sandwich chocolate cake. They were all delicious and looked very artistic.
Can't beat the French for fine dining ;)
Thanks to Summerlicious we can afford to come here and found this gem. Nice interior decor too.
