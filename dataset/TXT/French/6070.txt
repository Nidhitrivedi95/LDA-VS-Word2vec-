3s46-PMxoEIa7kUj0VrlXg Trendy, modern looking restaurant with very good selection of asian/american/italian fusion.

Lots of salads, pastas, grill meats and burgers. I opted for a simple cocktail and chicken ceasar salad, something light for the afternoon. Chicken was nicely seasoned and moist, it was a generous portion but for 17$ I expected something that tasted a bit more gourmet. The dressing was bland, I've had better out of a bottle.

Looking at their other menu options, everything sounds quite appetizing, but on the expensive side. All their pastas are between 15 to 25$, grilled steaks in the 30 to 40$ price range. They do have a children's menu though.
I would recommend checking out their website for promos, women get a 50% off discount on certain days.

Service was prompt and friendly for a quiet afternoon, I can't say how this place looks in the evening but I'm not against trying it once more.
