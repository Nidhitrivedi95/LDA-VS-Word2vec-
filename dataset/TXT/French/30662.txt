fVF5wayDyY6ZR5oJB1IK3g Very good appetizer but for the rest very disapointing. I order a pork shop that I had to return. The meat was chewy and hard but also the dish was extremely salty.  My wife complain as well on the saltiness. In my book the chef need to go back to cooking school. Frankly I do not understand all the good review. I probably caught a bad night.
