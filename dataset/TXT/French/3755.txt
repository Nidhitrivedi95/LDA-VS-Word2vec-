2B46bRpDh49eDyjXGhL_ZQ Enough with the chains and franchises. This place is good. 160 reviews and 5 stars certainly supports that. I hope it stay's profitable because society needs more diverse places like this. It's important for the sanity of culture. But the location is setback from Durango a good amount and exterior's mirrored storefront isn't doing any favors for them. This explains why it wasn't busy. I wouldn't have noticed it driving by. If I were them and could afford it, I'd relocate to a location with a lot smaller setbacks. Found it on Yelp. Food, Service and interior are all solid. Comfortable. Owners are friendly. Price is reasonable considering the skill in crepe making. Will go back. I encourage others to try it as well.
