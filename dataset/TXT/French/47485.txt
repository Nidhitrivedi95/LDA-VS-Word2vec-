O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q I brought 15 clients to this restaurant to enjoy a nice dinner and it was most disappointing.   To list my complaints about horrible service and bad food would take to much time an effort.  Las Vegas has way to many better places to eat than Morles.  Spend your money and time and elsewhere.  You have been warned!
