63hkYvXXcZsHeCeZBQbfew Practical because it's next to my office. But not disappointed by the food. Always good but a bit on the greasy side. Had the shawarmaz twice and it was good and filling. Garlic potatoes are also always a hit. Just don't eat there if you have any important meetings in person after. Next thing to try is the poutine which came highly recommended.
