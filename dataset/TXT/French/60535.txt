SBnpT6JDbah-5l_52GM5sw My wife and I visited Madison from Phoenix, and met some friends for dinner at Sardine. Wow...what a great spot! The food is amazing...we all shared plates, and everything was outstanding. Really cool, hip atmosphere - great lively crowd and great spirits/beer/wine selection ...we sat on the deck overlooking Lake Menona...beautiful setting. The waitstaff was super friendly and accommodating....this place truly exceeded expectations...2 huge thumbs up.
