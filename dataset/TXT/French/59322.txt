rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w Le Cirque is one of the best places in Vegas for a fine French meal.  This is my second dining experience here and t was just as fantastic.  Carl took fantastic care of us along with the rest of the staff.  I ordered the Digestion prix fixe menue with the wine pairing as I did last time.  Expensive, yes, but compared to comparable meals in Vegas for the same money it is still the best bargain for the number of courses and quality of food. 

In a nutshell, this is the best fine French meal you will find in Vegas for the money.  You can find several more places in Vegas to spend more (much more!) and maybe they will be better meals and experiences, but as far as I"m concerned, I'm VERY happy with Le Cirque and will return.  I think you will be too.

Ask for Carl.  He will take great care of you and his personality is great.

Enjoy.
