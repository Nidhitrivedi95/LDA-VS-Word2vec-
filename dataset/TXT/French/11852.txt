I am not a huge fish person, but the fish, especially the special was really tasty.  Service is very good too, our server was super enthusiastic, I wish I could remember her name.  I was horrendously jetlagged but still had a great time.  The place has good food quality, location, and service for the price.  It's not an extremely refined restaurant, but is definitely a great value and worth eating at for dinner.
