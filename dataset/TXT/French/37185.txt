IUtjbbqQ6jUSi4t2jjgYRA Came here for Saturday bunch. They have a pretty good selection of pastries. When we arrived we sat at the pastry table because all the tables were taken. I wanted to take a bite out of everything!  

We ordered the duck Benny with smoked beef tongue with salad and croque madam. The food was so good. I loved the duck Benny, it was so tasty! The benny was done perfectly, the amount of the yolky goodness is beautiful and whole dish together was delicious! 

Right before we left and we got a chocolate almond croissant, it was delicious. Flaky in the outside and soft in the inside. We are definitely going back and try other items!
