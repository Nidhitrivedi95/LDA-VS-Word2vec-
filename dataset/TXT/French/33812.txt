hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA I am an admitted Baguette Cafe addict. I have tried a few things on the menu, but my staple order is the Blue Brie (mushrooms), Medium vanilla Latte, and a chocolate twist. What makes this place special is the staff. The two Frenchmen that are always running the front are a pleasure every time. And the additional team is always very attentive. The outside seating is also wonderful during days where it's not triple digits.
