JvEu_1sJod6DGbYOatFvMQ Went here on a concierge's recommendation. It was wonderful. I give it a solid 4.5 stars. 

Food first! Like most good restaurants, the menu is small, but everything was very good. The escargot appetizer was wonderful. It was served in a brown sauce with shittakes and other mushrooms...much different than the typical butter presentation. The duck confit was absolutely wonderful. I am no beef tartar expert, but the diner who ordered it was very impressed and liked the spiciness to it. The lobster salad had a nice presentation and came with giant chunks of lobster. I only had a bite of it; I thought it good, but not as thrilling as the other dishes. Dessert was good too. 

I thought the prices were reasonable for the setting. For a glass of wine, duck, and tip, it was about $40. Our server was very good and formal. The service was a little short of undoing your napkin for you, yet people were dressed relatively casual. My only complaint on service is that our waiter disappeared towards the end of the meal and someone else took over. Like Andrea D. said, it is a simple, yet intimate setting.
