tCSlpwJQ4CZsUEMZeH2SFg Service is divine. Food is mediocre I hate to say. And it's expensive. We had dinner (my mate and me: a romance night out) and got tables in the corner sitting side by side which we loved. But the trout almondine is loaded with salt, and our $17 house special appetizer last Sat. might was cold in the middle. Wine service is exemplary: glasses are filled full for that $9. glass. I am torn about this place because they are so nice. Maybe I will try a simple salad next. Ha. Or just wine and dessert!
