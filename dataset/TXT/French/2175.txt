0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g picasso was very good.  everything from the excellent service to the top notch food to the $100MM in artwork displayed on the walls, picasso offers it all.

 let's see what i remember:

- foie gras torchon: this was very good...then again, how can one go wrong with foie gras? the tang of the pineapple and port reduction really helped with the richness of the foie.

- poached oysters: this was a first for me. the oysters were sweet and briny and the osetra caviar really helped the dish pop.

- roasted venison: this was served as medallions and rare (as requested). god damn, i wanna go hunt me some deer and eat them all year.  the protein was gamey in a good way, very lean and extremely tender.

we had more dishes (including dessert) but i can't recall them at the moment.  sorry gang.

is picasso worth the splurge?  yep.....but win big at the tables cause dinner at picasso will set you back a handful of benjamins.

to sum it up:

the food was quite good and the service was impeccable....but dinner is pricey.
