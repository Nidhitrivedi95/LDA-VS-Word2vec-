QeFsIMcIFIJcOrpthYL8jg My husband and I were in Montreal this weekend for the F1 race. We stopped in for dinner and truly enjoyed our meals. My husband had the Lamb Cavatelli and I had the Lamb burger...we loved it so much we came back a 2nd time and brought friends..We had an equally amazing meal, and service. For Americans, I was reminded that there is a slower pace than what were are used to...the slower service is their pace...not an indication of poor service. Sit back and relax. Enjoy the atmosphere and the meal.
