cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg I must give great thanks to my friend Mike, who made this experience possible. Going to Montreal has been one my best experiences in life thus far. APC was just amaaazing. My first time having foie gras and it was delicious. I wish that I had been more adventurous and gotten the duck in a can, however my wallet was doing the thinking so I ordered the steak frites, which as good. My friend ordered the Melting Pot which had close to everything but the oink of the pig and he was in Hog Heaven. My other friend had the duck breast in red wine I believe, and he thoroughly enjoyed his plate. I thoroughly enjoyed nibbling from both plates, though I stayed away from the blood sausage in the melting pot. 

What really got me though was the desert, gosh that was heaven. We ordered the Pouding Chomeur (Poor Man's Pudding) was heaven, like eating a cloud, I'm in love. Topping off an already ridiculously good dinner.
