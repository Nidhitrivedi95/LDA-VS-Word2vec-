I have to say, however, that my last experience here was just as great as before the change.

Call the swat team because that lobster poutine was the BOMB. Perfectly poached lobster with a rich, flavorful sauce, topped with spring onions and squeaky cheese curds, it was pure ecstasy.

The crab cake was really nice, cooked thoroughly, moist, and filled with an overwhelming amount of crab meat. The steak and ribs were great, as always.

The coleslaw was a shame, too much mayo and way too much sauce, my guess is that they ran out of cabbage that evening. The wild rice pilaf was very mediocre, and I could not finish it because it was so bland.

We did wait quite a while for food, maybe because the place was fully booked.
