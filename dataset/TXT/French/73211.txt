XNvklghmapxOlCB-wGv_sA By day, this is Jack Rooster Tavern, till 4 PM.  We were on our first day in town hunting for poutine for lunch and stumbled in thanks to some friendly servers street side that recruited us.

The best place was the first place!  The poutine was amazing.  The fries were big cut, and grooved to hold the gravy in place, perfectly crisp and tasty.  The gravy was lighter than some places, and the toppings were amazing - roasted chicken, peppered "secret" beef, and more.  They have an eclectic comfortable patio that reminded me of a Parisian Courtyard.  

There was a limited wine by the glass and beer selection - but enough to wet your whistle for lunch.  Highly recommend!
