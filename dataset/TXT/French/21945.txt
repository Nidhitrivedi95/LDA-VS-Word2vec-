BpTijSZy7-2SZskFSCVW2g I was walking south on Yonge St. and saw their sign, advertising "all day breakfast". I walked in and ordered one of the sandwiches off of the menu - egg and smoked salmon. I was told by the lady behind the counter that they were no longer serving breakfast. I asked about the sign outside that said "all day breakfast", as that was why I went in. She said something along the lines of "Oh yeah, they have to update the sign. We don't do that anymore", but she asked the cook if he could make an egg sandwich and he said okay. I asked again about the smoked salmon sandwich, which was on the menu, and she said no, only an egg sandwich. I agreed to the egg-only sandwich as I felt bad that he had already started making it. I poured a coffee to go and the total was about $12. I asked how it could possibly be $12, especially when I wasn't allowed to order anything other than scrambled eggs on two pieces of bread, and she just kind of shrugged and said that was the price. I said "$10, for scrambled eggs on bread? That's more than the smoked salmon sandwich" and she said, "Yep". I said nevermind and walked out. Terrible service, will never go back. And apparently they need a new sign.
