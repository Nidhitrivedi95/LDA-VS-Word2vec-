rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A went for brunch. overall food was pretty good (I got the chicken and waffles), but not for the $$. 
 pastries, especially pecan sticky bun,  were excellent. 

 Our waitress was horrible and extremely unprofessional, probably why she is working the brunch shift. However, you would think tho that at a restaurant of this $$ range, even brunch servers would be good. 

there were 3 of us, we each got 1 alcoholic drink and the total was $145 with tip; 
pretty pricey for an average breakfast(aside from pastries) and poor service
