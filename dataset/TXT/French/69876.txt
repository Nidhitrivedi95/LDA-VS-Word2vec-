WOj8nPos3R9IIf0Pyttd8g As far as Charlotte goes, this is a pretty darn good place for food.  And we also happened to find one cute waiter.

It was a quiet Tuesday night, and a colleague and I had a lovely dinner here - a delicious roasted beet salad was the highlight, and the steak special I had was well-prepared, and fennel served with it heavenly.  

Wine selection was all right, though the malbec we settled on wasn't all that spectacular.  It got us through, though.

If you're not from Charlotte, finding Lulu is a bit of a challenge.  It looks like a house and is a bit set back from the street.  Keep your eyes peeled for it, as I passed it twice before I realized where it was (and I have an eye for detail, mind you.  :-) ).  The interior is nice (the beveled glass "windows" that separate the sections of the dining room were a very nice touch), and the funky lounge space in the back (YAY curtain of beads!) had a distinctly "cool" feeling.
