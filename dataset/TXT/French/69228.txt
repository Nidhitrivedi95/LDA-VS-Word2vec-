w2tr0PA0b3tg8pId0kjM-A I confess I think macarons are overrated. They are pretty and have a fun texture, but I do not see the point in having entire shops dedicated to them. But Gaby et Jules is more than macarons. They have an assortment of desserts that are *almost* to pretty to eat. But you should definitely eat them.

My boyfriend suggested going in for dessert. Everything was shiny and gorgeous and some of the colors were so vibrant they looked more like candy than pastries. Ultimately, I shied away from the technicolor gelees and opted for a poached pear cheesecake and some kind of chocolate-on-chocolate mousse but let me be clear: they didn't look like cheesecake and mousse. Each was a work of art. Although there is a cafe table out front, there is no seating inside the shop so we took our selections to-go. Both were amazing, but the chocolate-on-chocolate was a little less interesting. The pear dessert had an amazing blend of textures and was truly a delight.

It's not an every day thing, but if you are looking for something special and fun this place is worth checking out. I do kind of wish you could eat there and maybe have a coffee or tea with it, but I guess that's not really what they are going for.
