This is one of the oldest buildings in Montreal (3rd oldest, I was told).  My wife and I were invited here for an official dinner, and we were impressed by the ambience and decor.  And of course our host regaled us with the history of Montreal, including les filles du roi (daughters of the king).

Definitely a place to consider if one is organizing a formal dinner.  Or a romantic  evening.  The place speaks for itself.  I like the spaciousness, with only a few tables in each room, which meant one can carry on conversations at a decent volume and not have to shout.

I had the grilled salmon which was decent.  Service was unobtrusive and servers were polite.  

Given that street parking in Old Montreal is always a nightmare, one of the advantages this restaurant has is its proximity (less than 5 min walk) to the car park at the Clocktower Quay where there is ample parking.  Parking is $12 but it's better than circling the streets of cobbled stones endlessly on a cold night.
