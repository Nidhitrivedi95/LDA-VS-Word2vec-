The atmosphere is amped to the max and I swear you'll think you are in some Parisian Bistro, or even a little something you would find more so in the southern coasts of France.  There were times when it felt a bit too overdone, but that could be overlooked, and forgiven. 

The price tag was a bit steep but the food was worth it, and I guess that is why it didn't reach a five star with me.  There are places that could deliver the same punch for your buck, but nevertheless a spot in Toronto worth discovering.
