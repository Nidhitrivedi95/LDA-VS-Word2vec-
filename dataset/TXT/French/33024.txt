H9pG0BNhqID2MTj8KnY3jQ Overall excellent service and food! We ordered a soup and wanted to share it. Once the waitress found out that we wanted to share, she served the soup in two separate bowls. Very attentive and considerate! 

The brunch menu is pretty much the same as the regular menu except for the price. The main dishes on the brunch menu are a dollar more expensive than the lunch menu. There is no lunch option on weekend . This information is available on their website. 

Even though it is a little more expensive than I anticipated and the portion size is a little small, the food is delicious. It is definitely worth trying.
