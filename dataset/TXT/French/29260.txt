eUjDWzbQ6eLZy0uELEOa9Q I went here for Sunday brunch with a group of friends. The interior of this place is great so if you are a fan of old industrial buildings turned into trendy urbanite hang outs this place will not disappoint.

The food here for brunch was pretty good, but I don't eat red meat so the beef brisket, bacons and sausages were a loss to me. They do however offer smoked salmon and custom made omelets. Like a dunce I loaded up my plate with food before I realized this, and had to eat a few other things first before I could go get the stuff I really like.

If I HAD taken the time to look at everything they had out for the brunch buffet first, then I would have known to to grab all the smoked salmon, taken it to the custom omelet guy and asked him to make me an omelet so overflowing with smoked salmon that I'd look like a ravenous grizzly bear as I ate it. 

Alas, I did not do this and ended up looking like a regular sunday bruncher. 

They have a jazz band playing on the mezzanine (nice touch, and a regular fixture I believe)

Also, the deserts rotate, so if you see something you like, don't necessarily expect it will be there next time you go for your desert plate.

And most importantly, Mimosa's are $10! Nothing comes as a bigger surprise than seeing your brunch was $25, and the modest sized refreshing side beverage increases the damage on your bill by 40%. If I'm paying 10 bucks for a Sunday brunch mimosa is should come in a Hoegarden pail, and the waiter should leave my table with a back problem after it's arrival.
