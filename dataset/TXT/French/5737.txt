3jKUbhGSjFTv5jZ0wnW0xA We had dinner here Saturday night.  What an awesome experience.  Both the service and fair were outstanding.   The bistro is located on a quaint walking street on the Plateau area of the city.  It was an easy walk from our hotel downtown which I must also say was quite pleasant.   I should also say my wife and I were traveling with three kids.  Everyone loved the experience and we'll definitely return the next time we are in Montreal.
