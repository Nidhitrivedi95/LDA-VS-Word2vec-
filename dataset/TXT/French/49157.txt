oPGUbqBpHNZvVu9gAFJbMQ The decor is just ok but everything else is fantastic. The "small" mixed seafood salad and the Wallay fish were incredible. I think that was the nicest meunière fish I've ever had. 

Our server was fantastic too. She spent the time to joke around with us a bit and made us feel like regulars. 

Highly recommend.
