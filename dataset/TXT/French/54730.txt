rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw Hospitality starts at the entrance, where a friendly hostess greeted and escorted me to my seat. My server promptly welcomed and presented me with the menu. Although service was professional, there was no sense of warmth in the service provided ... orders were taken, delivered and the occasional courtesy check was intermittently made.  No complaint at all from me ... again service was very professional. The food was nicely presented and very well seasoned.  Absolutely no need for the salt and pepper shakers at the table. All ingredients used were very fresh and cooked to perfection.  I highly recommend Bardot Brasserie to any culinarian who would like to experience a great meal.
