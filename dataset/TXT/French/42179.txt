kYATtIsqVEoawS47UcSlDA Stumbled upon Truckin' Good Food's truck for the first time on a Saturday morning at the Ahwatukee Farmers' Market with my wife shortly after we moved here from Indiana. Smelled the food before finally figuring out where it was coming from and had to give it a try. 

So I went with a Papa K buckwheat crepe (Palo Verde ham ~ pepper jack ~ mushroom ragout ~ spinach); great combination of flavors 

As a side dish (although I could have eaten a bowlful as a dish of it's own) duck fat frites. I am convinced that everything should be fried in duck fat; it is just an incredible flavor. 

The dipping sauces (garlic mayo; ketchup; red chili mayo; Dijon; malt vinegar; pesto; tzatziki; ginger tomato; honey mustard) with garlic mayo the one I had this first time. To my knowledge all of the sauces are made by Chef Jeff Kraus (owner/chef of Truckin' Good Food). 

The crepes and frites are both certainly filling, but without being heavy feeling. 

Lastly, the sweet crepes; 

my first time 
Nutella ~ caramelized banana ~ walnut 

smokin' cone 
chocolate crémeux ~ marshmallow brûlée ~ graham 

showtime 
caramel custard ~ almond ~ poached fruit 

jam on it 
choice of selected jams 

wake up 
coffee mascarpone ~ caramel ~ chocolate espresso beans 

I think they all sound/smell great, but I have a soft spot for Nutella everytime. :) 

If you get a chance to be in the same place as this truck, please tell Jeff and staff hello and you have heard good things about them. You will not be disappointed. 

PS They are looking at starting a fixed location (soon), so I will gladly post an update as soon as I get a chance to enjoy that next phase in Truckin' Good Food's evolution. 

Cheers!
