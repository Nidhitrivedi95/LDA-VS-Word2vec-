or4UVDjXEEjze3wNPjoAZA I've been here so many times and I didn't realize until yesterday when I was uploading pictures.

Ever since I had my oysters here six or seven years ago, I fell in love with this place and dine here several times a year.

First thing I always order is a bottle of pink lemonade. Lorina Sparkling Pink Lemonade is well made sparkling drink nicely complement my meals whatever i might have that day.

I like their oysters, and other seafood appetizers. Everything I had has been very good.  I also like to order cheese trays.  They normally have about 10 different cheeses to choose from and I like to try different cheese, and eat with olives, nuts, apples, and some bread.

For main course, I tried everything on the menu... Omelette is always good, they do cook with my favorite gruyere, of course it has to be good. Another my favorite is risotto. When I can't think of anything else, I order this risotto.  Sauce they serve is very tasty.  They rotate some menu from time to time and yesterday, I tried their salmon, and was very pleased with my choice.

For desert, if you want to order their signature chocolate souffle, order 15 mins before you finish your meal as it takes time for them to cook.  Whatever you order from the desert menu, don't forget to order French press coffee. It sure complements the sweets.

Service and ambiance is always good. I like they way they decorate the inside with many books. Server and other staff are very attentive and they know how to take care of the guests.

Always happy after my visit here.
