4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Dined here last Friday night (10/24) with friends for a 40th birthday party.  Table for 10.  The food was 50/50, and priced accordingly but the service was all but non-existent.  Ordered items missed and/or served under or over cooked, no checking on drinks, and no quality checks.  Just like the Eiffel Tower restaurant in this hotel, this establishment goes in the "poser" category - a place with the facade of a high-end food experience with the reality of an Applebees. 

I discussed the evening with the shift manager...she took the automatic 18% tip off of the bill then told us that we "were only hurting the servers" (out of guilt, we tipped back about 10%).  So to sum up:

- Mediocre food
- Bad service
- Management that makes YOU feel guilty for their shortcomings.

With so many other great places to eat in Vegas, I recommend giving this place a pass.  None of us will be back.
