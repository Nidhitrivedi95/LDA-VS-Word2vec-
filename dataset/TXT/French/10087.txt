4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Had an amazing last meal in Vegas here with 10 people. Had to place a reservation and then wait about 30-40 mins to get a patio seat, but WELL WORTH IT even during the daytime. I mean, just go get a drink at the Eiffel tower bar while you wait. Service was great, food was even better. For drinks I had a glass of their sparkling Rose and then a glass of the Frangria. The frangria as pleasantly NOT watered down or too fruity and also probably the cheapest drink on the menu :) For an appetizer I had a small portion of the mussels - delicious. I also tried someone else's baked goat cheese. AMAZING. Another person in our party got the duck confit and that too looked amazing. For my main dish I went with the lobster roll. Huge chunks of lobster and the most delicious, perfectly baked bun. Came with a little side salad and their fries are something else. I'm typically not a fries person, but their's are great. No ketchup or dipping sauce needed. A little pricey for lunch, but honestly everything in Vegas is pricey that's not fast food.
