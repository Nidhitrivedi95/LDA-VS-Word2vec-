vLkKorA1gPS97Zj0_WKA0Q Stayed at Aria for Thanksgiving. Spoke with the Concierge at the Hotel for a place to have a Formal Dinner with a Good Food and Ambiance. She Called and made a Reservation for 2 at the Twist by Pierre Gagnaire at Mandarin Hotel. Its on the 23rd Floor.

Place has the best Seat in Town. With only 60 Seats. This Place has a very classy Ambiance. The Host ask for our Coat and Seated Us Well. The Servers. All has a VERY VERY Good Knowledge on what they Serve. We got the Six Course Tasting Menu. Plus a very very good bottle of Riesling wine from Germany .Its not the Buffet type of Serving you see. But small serving that by the end of the Meal. You'll be very Full.

Im very pleased while they serve the Plate.They inform you of whats on it. How it was prepared. They all work together. I think i got around 5 + Servers come to our table explaining details on what they serve. 

As what I say. It may be very expensive But with the Experience? Id do it Once a Year. This is a QUALITY Restaurant with QUALITY SERVERS WHO KNOW WHAT THEY DO. From the HOST to Servers to the Managers !! Very Impressed.....

Bill for 2      $400+
Bill for Scharzhof Riesling. Egon Muller (2007)         $210

plus a good tip for the Service ....

Overall, Id Recommend it.....

Mahalo to the Hawaiian Guy who served us. Another Server who was in Maui too. And the French Server who's very pleased with all the Questions we asked...
