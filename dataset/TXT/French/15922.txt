6t7U64hS_cBZtVKSP-q5Ww I tried to find reasons to like this restaurant but after our brief experience there, it seems impossible. First we needed to ask for a table, once sitting, we were ready to order immediately as we had checked out the menu prior to coming in. They were quick to seat everyone else who came in, and since they were seating so many people, they were mixing up orders and giving other people who arrived after us the food which we ordered. They brought us fried wontons instead of the shiu mai and har gow we had ordered - after some investigation with the server, we were told that it was his first day. All good with us, we're easygoing people. It was only after we realized they served the same dish (which we had touched to inspect what it was) to the couple next to us as if they simply brought it to the wrong table. They brought the food over to them as if it was fresh out of the kitchen - this was EXTREMELY CONCERNING. Our food was not fresh and was clearly left to steam too long. They did not compensate in any way and we left with a bad taste in our mouth - literally and physically  I'm astounded that a restaurant advertising itself as a Susur Lee restaurant could be so HORRIBLE. Will certainly go out of my way to avoid eating here in the future as the experience, the food, the service, everything was well below satisfactory.
