4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw 3 days in a row for breakfast at Mon Ami Gabi. I'm a big fan of their Beef Hash & Egg Benedict. The food was great, huge portion. Also, it was very nice sitting at the patio, sipping mimosa, and enjoying the view of Bellagio & Vegas in the morning. Romantic & great food, that's all I can say :)
