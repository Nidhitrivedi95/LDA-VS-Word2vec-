i5vxtyiHKYnRcJ0p9N7mLw Was looking forward to a real Italian deli...being from the Northeastern part of the U.S.you can easily find one. This not so much...I got a salami, prosciutto and mortadella sandwich with asiago cheese with vinaigrette  which was flavorless. Very light on the cheese..the roll was olive oil and garlic but lacked a trace of either. They use Boars Head Meats. My wife had an eggplant parm sandwich her issue was the same just lacking any real flavor...bland...they had pasta dishes as well. as far as the market part...not much there...a few items but nothing I could not pick up at Whole Foods...if you are in that area it is a better choice than Rosati's which is next door but not a destination.
