IUtjbbqQ6jUSi4t2jjgYRA Went here for brunch a couple of weeks ago. I found myself in a small quiet place with only a few tables. When we were seated I looked around and noticed they had a daily menu and the display and counter were filled with very fresh looking baked goods. 

Service was pretty good and good took a little while to show up (small yet busy kitchen) but it was worth the wait. Delicious breakfast! Had the duck eggs benny and it was awesome. Finished it off with a soft and flakey almond croissant and a really nice americano. I'd like to come back again soon and try more on their menu, and definitely more of the pastries too.
