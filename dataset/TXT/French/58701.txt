RoGeo_pQ1TQc6Lyk4CSDgw This review is a bit old, so my memory wavers.

My wife and I went to Table 51 and I ordered the house specialty... the Braised Beef. The braised beef is a slow-cooked good portion of meat served on the bone in a deep plate with grelot potatoes and carrots in a delicious sauce. The braised beef was simply out of this world and something I have never tasted previously. I truly recommend trying it out yourself.

For dessert my wife ordered the fried Oreos. I already had my fill with the excellent braised beef but curiosity got the better of me and I tried a few.... it was delicious and fought my wife to get my due share! LOL!

As far as decor goes, if you enjoy retro-styled 60s cafeteria-like ambiance then this is the place for you. I don't recommend this place for romance as it was really noisy and lacked intimacy. The seating isn't particularly comfortable.

The service was more than adequate and the price range was expensive but completely worth it.
