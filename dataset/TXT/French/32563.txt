gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg I've been to this location a few times now.  (Great place to watch the St Patrick's Day Parade!  If you start freezing - Insider's tip- you can watch it while being warm inside and while drinking great beer).  The most recent time was last night.  It was just my friend and me and it was around 5 PM.  It was the prime time for dinner on one of the busiest streets downtown, on a Thursday.  It was no surprise that when we got there, it was super busy.  

The terrasse was packed.  There was room for two but the hostess said it would be really tight, so we decided to just enjoy the air conditioning inside instead.  I honestly wonder how many times the women at the front have to say that the customer has to go around to the terrasse side to see if there's room because they don't have communication with one another.   So.. they can speak to the person above them via communication systems but in this tech age, they can't reach someone 20 feet away?  It was odd.  

Other than that, I love their beers (some are odd- if you're not a fan of IPA just stick to what you do enjoy).

The service has its ups and downs.  I've always had a good experience when our server was male ( and no, it's not just because I'm female).  I've seen some of the females have breakdowns in the middle of service, crashing their dish carts into the glass casings in the middle of the restaurant.  It is really a hit or miss.

The food however- is good.  It's not amazing but if you're looking for a place to have a quick bite,   I usually get the quesadillas and my friends usually get the nachos or salads....  it's nothing to rave about but for $12, you get what pay for.  I have previously tried the Calamari and was unimpressed.  You don't get very much and you don't have the option of getting a marinara sauce like I enjoy; you automatically get the Teriyaki Horseradish Marmalade.

Overall, it's a decent place to get food- it's just not somewhere that I would rave about.
