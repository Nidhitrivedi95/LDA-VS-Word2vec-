5fquJHY2hMX9tPRD5s0t5g My husband and I ate here before seeing a show at the Blumenthal (which is conveniently located right next door) and sat at the chefs table looking in on the crew preparing dinner. The atmosphere was akin to Hells Kitchen, except for the loud screaming, crying or expletives with a British accent. Orders came in and everyone worked seamlessly to put out hot, delicious goodness. 

I had the seared scallops with wilted spinach and my husband got one of the nights specials - flounder. Now usually flounder doesn't make for a very thrilling dining experience, but this one knocked his knickers off. My scallops were buttery rounds of delightfulness that made me actually pause and enjoy each bite ... much unlike a normal American eater. To top it off, our server was Johnny on the spot with the check so we could get to our show on time. Outstanding!
