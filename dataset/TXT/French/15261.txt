6fPQJq4f_yiq1NHn0fd11Q La Creperie is located at the Paris Hotel & Casino.  It's always tempting to stop here when we are passing through.  I've only given into the temptation one time though.  Actually, we stopped that time cause our niece and nephew wanted crepes, and there were no lines on that occasion.

They've got the usual crepe choices.  Both savory crepes and dessert crepes.  I always prefer the dessert crepes cause I am such a sweet tooth.  The prices are expensive compared to most crepes that I've had elsewhere.  Although, if you are a Total Rewards member, then you get a discounted price of 50 cents off.  Still expensive though.

Our niece and nephew both enjoyed their choices while my wife and I thought our orders were just average.  Both my niece and I ordered the Nutella crepe which contained nutella, bananas, candied hazelnuts, cream, and caramel sauce.   She said she would give it 8 out of 10.  I thought that for the price, it was just average.  It tasted fine, but it should be priced 2 to 3 dollars lower.  Same for the other crepes that we ordered which were the mixed berries crepe and the ham & cheese crepe.  

Overall, just 3 stars because the crepes are overpriced.  I know that we're on the Las Vegas Strip, but come on!  Well, obviously the prices do not hurt business cause they usually have people waiting to order at the window when we walk by.  Good for them.
