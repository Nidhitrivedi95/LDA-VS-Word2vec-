Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA Atmosphere is 5 star.. view was 5-star... Food was 5 star but on this night service was one star ...hence the two. To start off The hostess accommodated our request for another table which was appreciated. Once we sat.... we were in no man's land. as the servers flew by our table it became comical to watch water being served all around us, then bread. The sommelier continued to walk tables with that look that was "I'm doing my job but not really looking at your table"  we had showered I promise and were smiling etc.. I swear I didn't have my middle finger on display. after 15 minutes of waiting we were approached. I get busy and understand the issues at times in a restaurant but with the reputation of Mix and soooooooo many restaurants to choose from in Vegas I would expect more.
