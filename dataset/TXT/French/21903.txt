My sister and I had spent the day at a spa in Montreal, and a woman who worked a the spa highly recommended Vallier for dinner. My sister and I were starving when we arrived, so we asked the waiter to put in an order of calamari while we looked over the drinks menu, he said the calamari is instant and it was a good idea to order right away since we were hungry. About ten minutes later we were, ready to not only order our drinks but our dinner as well, the waiter took forever to come back to take our order.. Not sure why he was so frantic because he didn't have that many tables. He finally took our order and came back with our drinks a few minutes later, we ordered the white sangria, which was delightful! He continued to be frantic, and about fifteen minutes later we got our dinner. I said to the waiter I assume the calamari is not coming out? He looked confused for a minute and then said oh yes you ordered calamari! Why didn't you ask me about it when I brought the drinks? I told you they are instant! I responded well I didn't know you had forgotten our order, and thought it was taking a little longer. The waiter was not available if we did want to flag him down to ask him what the eta was anyways. My sister had the ravioli and I had the lamb Shepards pie both meals were lacking salt and spices, both meals were very bland! The waiter never asked if we were enjoying our meals, and every process from start to finish took forever including him bringing the bill and the credit card machine!

There are so many great restaurants in Montreal, Vallier is not one of them.
