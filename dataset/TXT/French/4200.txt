We went for a quick bite -- taking the name somewhat seriously -- and sat at the bar counter to speed things further.  Unfortunately, is was about 45 minutes before our sandwiches (Croque Monsieur) arrived.  I had to scarf it down in order to get to my meeting.  My wife stayed to finish at a more leisurely pace, and the resto did comp us two glasses of wine...but buyer beware, they didn't live up to the name.  

Food-wise, I would give it 4 stars for what it is -- straight-ahead bistro fare.
