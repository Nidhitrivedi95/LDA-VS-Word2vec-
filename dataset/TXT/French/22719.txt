bzbNGyrTwWHAgg1CqkSgeg The below review was written by my husband....

Went on Sunday. Supposedly, you can't make reservations for Sunday, but I heard people doing "call aheads" ... which is the same as a reservation in my book! Put name on list for 15-20 minute wait. Waited more that 20 minutes. Went inside and asked for update. Hostess said she texted our phone twice with no response and then deleted our spot. We received absolutely NO texts. This happened to 2-3 other people that I personally witnessed. Other groups of more people arrived ahead of us, ate and left before us (on a day with no reservations). The chicken apple sausage used to be two links (I think) and now it's one link cut lengthwise. The crab cakes benedict were ok and my wife's pancakes were ok, but they didn't say that the cakes came with powdered sugar by default which is something she doesn't like. So, the wait and the "ok" food are enough of a reason to not go back for Sunday breakfast for quite a while. We loved our server and the hostess seated us immediately after I asked for an update. So, I'd have to say that the service was decent, but was  the overall experience compelling enough to warrant a return visit (any time soon)? No.
