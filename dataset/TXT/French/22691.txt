bzbNGyrTwWHAgg1CqkSgeg So sad. This location is excellent. The food is above average. The decor is lovely. The service...ugh. Why? Why? Why? It's so easy to fix?!? SMILE a little!! Even my teen-age sons said that our server didn't look like he enjoyed his job very much. Couldn't get refills on coffee to save my life. I admit, it was brunch...so coffee is a crazy request! He really missed out too. I'm a 50% tipper if the service is at least fair - as I understand everyone has a bad day. But NOBODY was smiling. Everyone looked miserable. And if your servers are miserable, that means your management is miserable. And if your management is miserable, than I certainly don't want to add to the funds of an owner that makes people miserable. Will give it another go, as I try to give everyone a 2nd chance, have even experienced a couple of turn-arounds...but man - it could be such a warm, successful, happy place...{sigh}
