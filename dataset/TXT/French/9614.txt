4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Best ambience one could ask for , right in the middle of the strip, directly overlooking the Bellagio fountain show across the road. We were out looking for a perfect meal and after much research we decided on Mon Ami Gabi which was just as cute and french as the name. We were seated on the patio without much wait and were served by this wonderful lady who was very generous with her suggestions. We got an order of the french onion soup which was de-licious and was served with a freshly baked baguette accompanied with whipped butter and a carrot relish. The only way to describe the carrot relish is by saying that my husband who cannot stand carrots requested for a second serving!! For our main course we ordered the hanger steak and a side of brussel sprouts. Although we asked for the steak to be cooked medium rare, it came out well done but no harm done cause the flavour was incredible and the hand cut fries it came with were great. The brussel sprouts were flash fried and totally elevated the humble vegetable. My husband and I enjoyed a romantic night out with brilliant service and ambiance. Will definitely visit this restaurant again when I m back in vegas.
