HL6ZzGF7V-KDaU0zziHyEA Who would have thought that food served in a hotel restaurant could be 'I still salivate as I dream about it' worthy? Well I guess if you're the Ritz Carlton you wouldn't settle for a restaurant that didn't make Canada's top 100 list. Let alone, anything below the nb 27th spot held by La Maison Boulud!

Namesake restaurant after Michelin star renowned chef Daniel Boulud, this place is probably the epitome of fine dining in Montreal... well at least from my experiences ;)

Every dish is a work of art in not only presentation but in complexity of flavour. There is not a single drop of sauce that goes unnoticed for the depth of flavour it adds to the dish as a whole. That little dot of brown sauce in the lobster bisque? It's actually a reduction of mushrooms that adds an earthy element to a seafood flavoured dish. That hint of yellow you get underneath the parmesan emulsion? Yes, there is indeed lemon zest that freshens everything up.

From the moment you walk in and get seated by the stunning model like hostess to the one where the waiter expertly recommends and paces your food to finally the one where you let that perfectly creamy burrata melt in your mouth ... you'll really feel like you've just experienced what Montreal and the historically luxurious Ritz had to offer in terms of the finer things in life.

Granted, with finer things do come along a more pricier tag, but from time to time it's worth the splurge and La Maison Boulud falls into that category :)
