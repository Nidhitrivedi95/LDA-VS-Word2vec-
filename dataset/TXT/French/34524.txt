HojKatUfX4UHWaPqtl63NQ Generally unimpressed. Was really hoping for an exciting dining experience. The food fell flat. My mother ordered the tasting menu and wasn't even able to eat the duck because it was so tough. The timing on the delivery of the courses was really off. I am not difficult to please and approach most dining experiences with a desire to be satisfied and grateful. That did not happen here.
