xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g We ain't impressed with the dinner tonight.  I made a reservation for window table and arrived early.  We got sat about 20minutes later.  We sat in the middle of the restaurant.  Being a fine dining restaurant, we should have been informed if the window table wouldn't be available or would it be a longer wait.  We advised them at the time of the reservation that, this is a birthday celebration.  
Our service was great.  The food was okay.  We had few appetizers warm foie gras, steak tartar and sweet corn soup.  Then we went for foie gras and King filet mignon and Pork chop for dinner.  We saw a little bit of the Bellagio fountain view.  At this point we didn't care to try dessert anymore.  We just want to leave.  Medium Filet mignon was red.  My birthday girl didn't eat her medium cook filet.  Her complimentary dessert didn't have a candle.  How are you going to give a birthday girl desert without a candle... I guess no birthday wish to be made.  
We can go somewhere else. 
Overall if you want to see the epic view of Bellagio fountain.  I suggest to dine at Bellagio.  Lago has the best view of the fountain.  Very disappointed.  We frequently dine at the Top of the world which has a better view of the strip.  I can't recommend Eiffel Tower restaurant.  The stars are for overall service which was okay. The server was attentive.
That's all I have to say.
