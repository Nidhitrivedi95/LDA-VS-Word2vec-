VwZhwflLnTq19aAeFLJHCQ This is my first time writing a review and it is because this place is fantastic!!!! What a meal! I had the ribeye and pesto mashed potatoes. The steak was cooked to perfection and the pesto made the mashed potatoes the best I've ever had. My mom had the chef's special: Chilean sea bass. Her meal was even better than mine if that is even possible. It melted in your mouth and I could drink the sauce by itself. I've been to some great restaurants like n9ne steakhouse and il mulino and I feel like this place ranks up there with them (for a great price). We also had a great creme brûlée, it wasn't the best I've ever had, but was still creamy and delicious. Besides the amazing food, the service was outstanding! We had the pleasure of being served by Danny! I hate when I ask a waiter what they're favorite dish is and they say everything. Danny made sure to tell me his favorites and recommended what sides would be best with our meals. He was very attentive and genuinely nice. The highlight was when Chef Bernard came to thank us for coming to his restaurant! He was so sweet and humble and made us feel like a million bucks. Whoever is reading this... Do yourself a favor and try this place out! You won't regret it!!
