gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA Absolutely the best best restaurant in Vegas. I have lived in Vegas for five years and have ate at them all and I'm telling you this place was unreal. From the food to the service to the view, I honestly don't think you could find a better place. Impeccable service and they had the cutest set up for birthdays. Hey give you a gold key to open a treasure box at the end with a personalized dessert that says happy birthday.  My husband and I left full and very happy. Would recommend to anyone!
