0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g I have had many experiences in my life, but Jose Serrano's food at Picasso was one of the truly memorable nights I had in my life.  I was there with my partner and celebrating 7 years of being together made it all more special at this place. The service from beggining to end was spotless. 

The ambience is perfect, the real Picassos around you set the scene. You are in a museum, you are in a restaurant, food is art. Which brings us to José Serrano's Truffle Menu with Wine Pairing. It is really hard to describe all the flavours i discovered that night. Each bite was exquisite, from the Egg Pollé, through the risotto, ravioli butternut squash and filet mignon, the truffles are always present. If you live to go somewhere do not miss Picasso one of my most exhilarating gastronomical experiences.
