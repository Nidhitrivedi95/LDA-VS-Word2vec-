We came by for brunch and wanted to sit outside so we had to wait about 15 minutes. The restaurant got a lot busier after we sat down though so there might be a longer wait than that. Our waitress was friendly and I thought service was great. 

I ordered the three eggs plate which also had bacons, hash browns, and toasts. The eggs were cooked right and they were perfectly round. The bacons were thick which were good but I prefer my bacons on the thinner side. The toasts tasted great with the jam and white butter/cream! The jam was not too sweet and had a rich fruity flavor to it. My boyfriend ordered the corn beef hash which was presented nicely on the plate. The meat tasted so good, so soft, and so juicy.

Overall, I had a good experience at this restaurant. They have good coffee to keep you awake so you can stay awake and gamble all day long.
