Everything's that great about an upscale French restaurant, without the snobby attitude you would find in Paris. A+.

Came here on New Year's Eve at 7pm with my family. We had the New Year's Eve $49 tasting menu - appetizer, main, and dessert. Place got busier throughout the night but service was always spot-on.

SERVICE: 10/10
Waiters were very warm and genuine from the moment we walked in the door, and struck the perfect balance between attentive and not being overbearing. Our family tried all the options from the tasting menu and they were very accomodating about bringing us all sharing plates and extra utensils, without any hint of snobbery (try doing that in a Parisian restaurant if you want to see the most contemptuous sneers possible).

FOOD: 8.5/10
We tried all the items on the New Year's Eve menu: butternut squash soup/salad/pork belly for appetizer (all fantastic), steak/lamb/salmon for the main (also all fantastic), and crème brulée/chocolate mousse/raspberry sorbet for the dessert (least favourite part of the meal, but still on point and quite delicious). 

All dishes came promptly and together. Portion sizes felt perfect: we had room for dessert, and left feeling full.

DECOR/PLACE/PARKING: 10/10
Decor inside and outside is beautiful, elegant, and very romantic. They will validate your parking ticket for two hours of free parking in the Renaissance Court parking lot on Cumberland Street, and the restaurant is on the ground floor, just outside the elevators.

Overall, a fantastic experience.
