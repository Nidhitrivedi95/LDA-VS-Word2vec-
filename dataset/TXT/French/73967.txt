He wanted lamb chops, plain, with a different side dish, and they happily accommodated him.  The window tables give you a terrific view of the strip, and you really feel like you're dining in the Eiffel Tower.  The kitchen absolutely knows how to prepare top-quality dishes, and continue to have pride in their work.  If you want a really fine splurge, this is your place.
