H4N3wGaSJsy8hrNDtADmug The bed and breakfast i was staying at for a conference had breakfast but I really wanted to have a nice sit down breakfast on my last day in Montreal. As noted in other reviews the restaurant is just into the village and definitely seems focused on serving the local residents in that area (a number of rainbow items in the cafe) and of course, also a number of cool pig themed items. For breakfast, among other things, they offer a number of omelets and....one of my favorite breakfast items, eggs benedict (several types, including one with asparagus and another with crab). Coffee was provided right away and it was only a short time till breakfast arrived with a nice side of home fries. As others have noted the national dish of Canada, poutine, seems to be a popular item but could just not see having that for breakfast. 

Overall, a cool (and somewhat funky) little place that is popular with the locals and for breakfast, a good solid choice away from the hustle and bustle of the tourist area - worth going to at least one morning when you are in Montreal.
