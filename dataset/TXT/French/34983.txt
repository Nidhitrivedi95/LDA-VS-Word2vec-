HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw made reservation through opentable.com after not being able to decide on where to go and so we try it out..
the only thing that I think is modern french in this restaurant is their decor and how they name the dishes because food was okay, service was okay, a bit slow, and dessert was to me is the highlight of my meal.. 
tried out the escargot as appetizer, I think that it's a bit too chewy, but the sauce was right on spot so I ended up using the sauce to dip my bread on..
we had a steak and lamb chop for entree and that sure took a while without the server ever coming to our table to inform that our food took longer than usual maybe..
overall, a bit overpriced for a decent food, so it was okay,
will I come back?? Not really...
