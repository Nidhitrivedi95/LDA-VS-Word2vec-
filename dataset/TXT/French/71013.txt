xcmmTXhuMx2fZF2Bt69F4w Maybe my expectations were a bit too high, but I was kind of disappointed in my brunch at Point Brugge.

There was maybe a 10-minute wait for 2 people at 1:00, which was not bad at all.  The restaurant itself is nice, even though the tables are a bit close together.  Service was nice and quick without being obtrusive.  I ordered one of the prix fixe meals - Liege waffles with fruit, the potato strudel, and a mimosa, plus a side of fries.  The fries were pretty good and crispy, but not mind-blowing.  The mayonnaise was not particularly basil-y.

The waffles - not that great.  The menu says that Liege waffles are supposed to be dense and a bit crunchy with a caramelized sugar flavor.  They were kinda bland and dry, except where the fruit topping had been, where they were soggy.  Syrup or butter would have helped.  The mimosa and the potato strudel were both very good.  My friend ordered the French toast, which looked awesome.  I kind of wish I had ordered it instead.  Total was $36, which seemed a little pricey, but we did get a fair amount of food.

Overall, I wouldn't mind giving it another chance but I wouldn't be devastated if I never made it back.
