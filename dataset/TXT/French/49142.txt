oPGUbqBpHNZvVu9gAFJbMQ French seafood fine dining to go to! Be prepared to pay deep out of pocket but worth it for the price. 

Started out with the grilled octopus appetizer which was small but grilled to perfection and paired perfectly with the bruschetta. 

The BF had the Arctic char meunière (flat fish between a salmon and a trout) entree with rice and vegetables and I had the Chilean sea bass (a hearty meaty white fish) which I have had before with rice and mashed potatoes. 

While we were waiting for our entree to come out, they brought out a salmon croquette to cleanse our palates which was super tasty. 

Will definitely save money to splurge on my next dinner here when I come back
