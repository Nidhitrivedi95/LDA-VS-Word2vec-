VmSkQsAjUtzJeliKeGQCOQ I come here for a lunch and ordered the brunch special: Egg benne and the Tenderloin steak sandwich.

Maybe it's brunch, the presentation doesn't look as nice as the one shown from the pictures that other reviews have posted. It's still acceptable but I guess dinner will be better.

Anyhow, the more important factor is taste.. The Egg Benne is ok, with runny yolk inside, sauce is on par, so nothing different from the ones I have had before in other restaurants. So it's ok.  For $13, acceptable for this dish.

As for the tenderloin sandwich, for $16, I think it's worth the money with the portion of food you get : 6oz tenderloin, bread, sautéed onion, mushroom, bacon, cheese, fries, and salad. Cannot complain... 

Looks like in the area, this is the only restaurant that offer these kind of food, so it's a nice addition to the area. I have mention this on my other review before, this restaurant is very close to Red Bulb, so u can go grab a latte or a nice cup of coffee after finish the brunch here! :)

The decor is ok and clean and my waitress is very friendly! A big plus! I initially give this a 3.5 stars but I give it an extra 0.5 star because of the friendliness of service.
