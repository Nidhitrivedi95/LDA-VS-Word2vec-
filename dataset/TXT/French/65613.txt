U2S9n1asjTTI_EvBFBNnAw Went there for New Years and had a great time. The food was great. The service was great. And somehow they timed it perfectly so that we left with 15 minutes before the countdown. Just perfect. I've seen some bad reviews of this place here. I don't know, maybe they've turned over a new leaf because my experience was excellent.
