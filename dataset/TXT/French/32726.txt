h_ypoQ2rmwX8UGSmohsGiQ I recently went to the launch event for new cocktail menu at Maman. The cocktail, which I tried was 'Le Vert' and it was great! It was exactly how I like my cocktails - not sweet! 
Apart from the drink, the highlight, for me, were their sweet treats! I happen to be a huge fan of lemon meringue pie and one of their sweets was a lemon meringue bite size treat. I could have eaten the entire tray! 
The food is amazing, the décor is lovely...all in all, I will be going back to this French inspired cafe! A great addition to the financial district...and a great escape from the concrete jungle to the French country!
