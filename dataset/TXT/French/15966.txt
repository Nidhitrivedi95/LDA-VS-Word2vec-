The food and beverages are very pricy and they try to convince the public they are a 5 star restaurant. far from it. for example a bottle of domestic beer is $6.75 and an 8 OZ steak is 36 dollars. This is the same price you pay at the KEG bar and grill and your bartender and waitress are hot and sexy!   let me spell it out again: THIS IS NOT A GOURMET RESTAURANT, it JUST HAS GOURMET  P R I C E S !!
