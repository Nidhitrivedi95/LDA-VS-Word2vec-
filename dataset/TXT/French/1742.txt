0JGMKaKJGVuDus5WcJzvjw I was determined to get me and my husband here on our honeymoon. As an epicurean who is also obsessed with vintage and antique everything (don't come into my tiny apartment unless you're prepared to redefine the word hoarder), I wanted to stuff ourselves off vintage china and flatware and that we did. We stuffed ourselves to the gills with wine and lobster pasta and clams casino. Also, the most memorable dessert I have had, hands down: warm financier pear tart with frangipane. This financier was baked in a tart pan, nutty brown delicious, with a half a pear baked into it. I'd do anything for this recipe. Came with a cup of pear sorbet that was basically biting directly into the ripest pear of the season. So clean, so fresh. 

Liverpool House is the equivalent to a fine whisky/whiskey/scotch; warm, brown and glowing. I love that it's so warm and inviting inside while it's biting cold outside. Makes me feel like I'm in a cabin. Staff is incredibly welcoming. But, it's straight forward; if you order clams casino...you'll get exactly that. Not an ethnic rendition, not a fucking deconstructed version...just clams casino. And that's what I ordered. That's what I want.

Moments of awkwardness: How is a place that was opened by a large man (Dave McMillan) not large or spacious enough to fit a large woman?! Dude, this space is so small and tight (cozy and intimate) that I could barely squeeze my fat arse in between other tables and chairs when I left.

Standing in the corner with hoards of other people to stare at a chalkboard menu in the dark. Hella hard to decipher, hard to not feel pressure to make a split decision and again...stuck in the corner with a crowd of other people also trying to decipher menu.

And still...I love it.
