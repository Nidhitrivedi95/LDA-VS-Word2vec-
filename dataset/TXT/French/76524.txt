The service is excellent, our waiter was so on top of it, i could have dropped my napkin and he would have caught it before it hit the ground.  They also have little chairs for your handbags so you dont put them on the ground, because its bad luck! Haha, they have fresh watermelon juice in the morning! That was fun, and if youre there for breakfast, order a side of the potatoes.  Not only was it visually amusing, but everything tasted great.  I would go here again in a heartbeat.
