YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g ive eaten here twice & was more than satisfied both times! service is great, food is amazing, & the setting is beautiful! the oysters are delicious, tuna tacos are a must, & the pork is so tender it melts in your mouth!

the dishes they have are so creative & different that you cannot get fine dining anywhere like it! everything is cooked to perfection & not only are the special dishes amazing but even sliders & fries are the best on the strip!

fluer is a great place for a dinner date, family get together, or even if you just want a great meal!

i would definitely recommend this place to anyone that loves great quality food! 5 stars!
