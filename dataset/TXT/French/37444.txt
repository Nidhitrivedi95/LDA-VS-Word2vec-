j0baDQfMAGDm_QGdFMmb-Q Bruschetta bread came out hard as a rock, asked for another and it was much better, thanks.  Also ordered the scallops that weren't anywhere near the quality of our first visit a couple if months ago.

Main course:  ordered salmon and it was raw.  I like my fish a little bit undercooked but again, it was raw. Asked to have it sent back and by this point it was our second dish sent back so we were beginning to feel a bit uncomfortable with our experience.  The waitress said that most people like it like that...just take it back will you?  It came back out 5 min later cooked, but by that point we were very turned off.  

The $30 bottle of wine ($7 at total wine) we got was very good but we had to sit and wait 15 minutes with glasses empty for a refill.

We live right next door and we will NOT go back.

Edit: oh AND we went there specifically for mussels but they were out of all mussels on this Sunday night.
