hzyvL2v97xLzLbLXcdi1uw I was excited to see a new crepes/waffle place opening up...to replace a crepes and waffle place!  However, after trying both crepes and waffles I remain disappointed.  The waffle I ordered was mysteriously...not hot at all.  It was topped with grainy chocolate spread.  The crepe, while hot, was a little bland and soggy.  

The ambience is nice and the La Prima coffee hit the spot, but I'd love to see improvements in the food before giving this windmill another whirl.
