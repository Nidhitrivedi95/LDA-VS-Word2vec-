U1LB3sRMGTu_h7Sf9QdNoA I visited this place for lunch previously. It was pretty good. I decided to check out their brunch. When we arrived the host was warm and accommodating. I chose from the savoury crepe menu, Le Montagnarde. It was okay. It was a bit uninspired to be honest. It was a toasted buckwheat crepe, grated chedder cheese, a fried egg and bacon. You could tell it was left on the salamander for a long time. The cheese was congealing and the fried egg was heat damaged. 

That really wasn't the worst part. 
My sister ordered a florentine eggs benedict. 
It came out without any hollandaise on it. The server assured me it would be a couple of minutes. He completely forgot. The eggs sat without sauce for 20 minutes even after I reminded him two times. When the sauce was finally ready, I asked him to replace the dish since it died waiting for him. He told me that he wouldn't do that since the sauce would warm it up. AND if I didn't like it at the end he would reduce the price. I told him I didn't like that idea. I asked if he would want cold eggs. He never replaced it because he was worried he'd get in trouble, but he did offer to give me "something else for free". Which was nice of him I guess.

My sister is too nice to complain, but I was a bit angry at the treatment. I gave him a bad tip. 15%. Hopefully they'll get their shit together and train their staff on how to deal with complaints. Until then, I give this place a pass. (even for the entertainment district)
