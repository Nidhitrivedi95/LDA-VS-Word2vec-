The prices for grub are resaonable. The French owner made a point to remember our names and greet us with a hearty welcome.  I had a sandwhich and salad. Everything was made with fresh , crisp and wholesome ingredients.

This place is definitely off the beaten path. It is tucked away in a business complex. Their hours are limited 7-5 Monday - Friday and closed on the weekends. Limited hours and no weekend hours cost them another star. I do understand that the cafe must cater to the corporate clients based on location. Overall, a nice option if if your craving grub similar to Panera but want a small town..feel good greeting from the owner. If you're in need of change in pace or scenery.. give this place a shot!
