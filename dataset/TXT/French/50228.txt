ovtlrcsVRlgZZQUlHs_ovw My husband and I finally tried this place out and where thrilled! We didn't have a reservation but were able to get a seat on a Friday night no problem. The decor is beautiful and we felt very relaxed. The waitress, Jennifer, was awesome. She was attentive without being pushy. She told us all about the specials including price which some places don't do. I had the lamb rack special and it came with three ribs, which were delicious. My husband tried the Alaskan halibut and was quite happy. We can't wait to go back and they the burgers and sweet potato fries. They looked good. If you want a nice atmosphere and yummy food try it out.
