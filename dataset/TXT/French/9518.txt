4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw The outdoor seating is really cute.  I ordered the BLT Benedict which was on special for breakfast.  It was okay.  The hollandaise sauce was so buttery, I guess its good there was a lot of saltiness.  The bacon was also good and crispy, I just wish I had more than one strip on each piece of muffin.  Also, my food was below room temperature.  Bfs food was served to him hot. The service was also okay, not really good like I expected or hoped for.  Oh well, maybe better luck next time!
