vg55SAkrEmuHpWfIMtJjBQ I dined at Legume twice at it's new Craig location. Both times everything was well prepared, reasonably priced for the quality, and served extremely professionally. I would strongly recommend Legume especially if you are specifically looking in the area but am not able to speak as emphatically about it as many of the 5-star reviews.
