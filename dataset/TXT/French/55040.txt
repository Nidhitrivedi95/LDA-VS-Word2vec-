rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Oh, Bouchon, how I love thee...  We came here with some friends on a Sunday morning for brunch.  It is a little difficult to find, but once you know how to get here (parking structure elevators) it's pretty easy.  There was about a 20 minute wait, but the hosts were very good at communicating with us to let us know how much longer even after we put our name in.

I will start off by saying that the only bad thing here was that our server seemed to be MIA a good portion of time.  I attribute this to her having been sat a 8-10 person table just after us.  However, even the lack of service was made up by the quality and quantity of their food.  Each table gets bread, butter, and homemade jam to start.  I am not a huge fan of apricot jam but this was delicious!  The presentation was there, too.  Each butter came out pre-covered with a Bouchon logo, which was unique and reassuring for quality purposes (and a little for show).   

For the main course, two of us got the Croque Madam, one got the corned beef hash with eggs and toast, and my husband got the sourdough waffles.  Every single dish was amazing - especially the waffles!  I didn't think waffles would be any different, but they were.  Sourdough waffles topped with bananas, walnuts, syrup, and butter were pretty close to heaven.  My Croque Madam, which is essentially a ham and Swiss sandwich topped with an egg and mornay sauce, was absolutely mouth-watering.  And, the corned beef hash, which I normally dislike, was so savory.

We will definitely come back here next time we're in the area.  Hands down one of the best breakfast places I've ever been to.
