dDKhRQlw_OVsPLQAGAeNyA We found this place by just wandering around Montreal and checking Yelp reviews and I'm so glad we picked it! This is a very intimate restaurant and the staff is very nice. Our service was a bit slow, but our waiter apologized for forgetting us by giving us extra wine, which is always a nice gesture. We both ordered beef stew and it was one of the best meals we've ever had; the flavor was perfect and the beef was incredibly tender. Our dessert of strawberries and cream was such a nice ending to our meal and it was overall a wonderful experience. I highly recommend Le Bourlingueur if you're looking for a traditional French meal or you're looking for a romantic dinner.
