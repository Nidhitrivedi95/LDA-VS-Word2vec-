d482l58ho0_IMdFkXX1F5Q This place is next to the Bourbon Room in the Venetian, right off of the casino. My friend and I walked around in circles looking for it, and of course it's in the very last place. So for sake of ease, it's next to Bourbon Room. ;)

We ordered the Caesar salad, which easily split into two. They did that for us, and the flavors and textures were enjoyable.

My amiga got the salmon and loved it. It was a modest-sized portion, cooked to perfection, and dressed nicely with beautiful sauces and accoutrements. I got the crispy duck confit, which I can't recommend enough! The skin was perfectly crispy, the duck was juicy, and it was served with some delicious greens and mushrooms. I highly recommend this dish.

One other reviewer mentioned that you should skip the bread "basket" and the desserts. I would have to concur with this sentiment, though their hard French is quite good and salted nicely. For dessert I had the "black and white," which is a warm flourless chocolate cake with a verbena ice cream. The cake was lukewarm and got cold quickly. I didn't like the verbena ice cream at all, but I won't hate on it since it's probably a personal preference. I kept eating little bites of it to see if it would grow on me or blend with the cake nicely, but I wasn't sold on it. I don't feel like the price tag of the Black and White matched what I got. Cappuccinos were very good.

This place gets knocked down a star for the service. I was NOT impressed at all. The server was very brisk with us, did not introduce himself, and treated us like we couldn't afford things. I'm glad he thinks that I look young, but it doesn't mean I can't afford the meal I want to eat. I felt very unwelcome at dinner. The food runners all seemed to be a lot calmer and certainly more polite to us than the server. The food was fantastic, and ambience was nice. It would be worth another try, but I would walk out if they gave me the same server.
