4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw This was my first time at Mon Ami Gabi. I wanted to go because of the good reviews and wanted a view of the Bellagio water show during lunch. Unfortunately,the water show did not happen while I was there. The decor of the restaurant is nice.They served bread which was hard on the outside but soft on the inside. I ordered the Seak Frites Classique and was impressed. However, when I ate this one fry,there was a piece of metal in it. Thankfully I didn't swallow!I showed my server and she said she will show it to the manager and bring me a new plate. After waiting for about 10 minutes,the manager himself came with the new plate and apologized for the mishap. Thankfully,the new plate had no problems. Overall,it was a nice restaurant and plan to go to the one near where I live.
