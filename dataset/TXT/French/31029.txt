fyJAqmweGm8VXnpU4CWGNw Terrific local shop with top quality pastries, wines, and breads.  The owner is incredibly knowledgeable about wine and will guide you through the selection while being considerate and down to earth!  I hadn't been before but I will be back!  Phoenix needs more places like French Grocery!
