hvjgF-vnPw2jyL5DBuB0qg Certainly one of the hardest places I've ever tried to find (or get a reservation for), Le Garde Manger is high on my top Favorite restaurants EVER!

Chuck Hughes' (of Chuck's Day Off) restaurant hits on every gastronomic cylinder.  I have been twice and shared almost every dish we ordered, and I still haven't had something I didn't love.  

The prices are a bit high (I would be there every single day if they were $10-15 cheaper), but that just makes it more special when you can manage to go.  Getting a reservation can be tough, from the fact that the place is tiny, to their erratic phone answering.  

The food and atmosphere always lend themselves to a great night out, filled with conversation and laughter, which is what food should ALWAYS do.
