SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ We are not from Arizona but wanted some good fresh food which didn't have to thawed before cooking. We weren't disappointed at all!  The food was excellent and the server Danny was very efficient.  We are discussing coming back again before we leave Phoenix as we would like to try some of the other entrees.  We recommend this location without reservation!
