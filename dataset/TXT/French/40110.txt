Ostensibly a wine store that bloomed a French Bistro (or vice versa) on the shores of Lake Jacqueline with the consultative work of Alex Stratta a late al fresco lunch at Marche Bacchus seemed the perfect way to spend an afternoon in Las Vegas, the misting fans overhead doing an admirable job of keeping the patio cool despite the nearly triple digit temperature.  Clearly a menu designed with wine in mind but not particularly wanting to imbibe so early in the day it was instead the food that brought me to Bacchus, specifically the house charcuterie program and as such selecting the Bacchus platter along with an order of the house foie gras would be the order of the day, a lovely arrangement that paired beautifully with not only the warm house bread but also the weather, sun, water, ducks and turtles passing by.  From appropriately funky rillettes to spicy chorizo and a hearty pork pate each item on the charcuterie platter was excellent while the foie gras itself was delicate and creamy with all its characteristic sapor despite the surprisingly flavorless and liquidy gelee - a situation remedied quickly with a request for more quince.  Moving on to dessert, and actually a difficult choice amongst a pair of my favorites I eventually went with my instincts and selected the bread pudding, a delicate cloud that seemed to be made of angel food cake with ample house whipped cream and a sidecar of intense rum sauce spiked with cinnamon.  A lovely space that feels a million miles from the Strip I have no doubt I'll be seeing more of Marche Bacchus in my future, particularly given their frequent special events.
