rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Recently had a nice brunch with a couple of girlfriends. Everyone loved their meal and we left overstuffed because we just couldn't stop eating. 

I had the salmon, fresh bread with all the dressings. It was the BEST and most fresh salmon I've had. It just hit the spot. When my friend received the croque madame I had food envy! Also the yogurt was amazing and the fresh bread with butter and jam was fabulous! 

Had a great meal and def want to return!
