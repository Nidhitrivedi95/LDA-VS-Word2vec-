I especially liked that while all dishes were wildly creative, nothing was over the top weird just for the sake of showing off technique. Everything had a purpose and added to the taste and texture of the dish. There was a lot of molecular gastronomy going on throughout the meal, but none of it felt obtrusive. 

We got the wine pairings with it, which was probably unnecessary in hindsight. None of the pairings were bad, but they were not memorable either. 

One thing to note is that the meal is served in private room on a bar counter. It makes for good direct interaction with the chefs and fellow diners, but if it's not the environment you are looking for, this may not be for you. 

Some things I didn't like: 1)the reservation system. It's a bit gimmicky. I like the golden ticket concept, but actually booking a reservation is a cumbersome process that would normally turn me off. Why can't I just call or email like a normal person. 2) off-premises restroom.  Yes the staff will walk you there, but it's not in the restaurant. 

Overall I had a great time. I would want to come back in a couple of months and see how the menu changes.
