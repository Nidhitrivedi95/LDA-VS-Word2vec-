O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q Went with a girlfriend to just get drinks and enjoy the patio view.  It was around 4pm on a Monday and we were able to go to patio seating easily, though we needed the host to seat us, and they needed to take our name down as a reservation. I got the Grimlet, it was refreshing - came in a glass. I guess I was expecting it to come in a bronze cup thing, though I had seen customers at the next table with one.  My friend had a salad and it was a small portion, but looked delicious, I ordered the calamari, which was $20.00.  It was good, but not spectacular like I had hoped. The server was gracious and so seemed the rest of staff. 2 drinks and two side dishes later, bill came out to be approximately $80.00 (incl. a $15 tip).  So, I'd say it if wasn't for the experience and patio view, I wouldn't spend that much for a restaurant again.
