For $49 each we tried to pumpkin soup with melting marshmellows and the pate forestierre, the unctuous short rib and truffle burger and coq au vin, and for desert, the tart and the chocolate.  Impeccable service.  The wall of waterfall display is mesmerizing, though the bit with the Asian woman's face projected on it with the tendrils of vines is weird weird. Apparently, to get a window seat on the show, you have to get seated at 5:30 pm.
