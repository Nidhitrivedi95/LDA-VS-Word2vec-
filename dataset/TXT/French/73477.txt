xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g My husband and I celebrated our 48th anniversary at this beautiful restaurant.  We wanted a special place.  We were very pleased with the setting.  Our table overlooked the Bellagio Fountains.  The food was delicious and our server Igor was the best.  We had dinner at Maxim's in Paris, France many years ago, the Eiffel Tower restaurant here in Las Vegas surpassed that.  I highly recommend this place for any occasion.
