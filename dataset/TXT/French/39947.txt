K64Uw3a2Enh2MznpwRHWKQ You have to love a restaurant that gets it right from start to finish!  Everything from our reservation being confirmed to great great suggestions from the server to delicious food and followed by a tasty dessert.  I have dined here several times and never been disappointed.  Every time I tried the specials, so I can't refer anything off the menu.  However, Specials indicate a creative and talented kitchen crew.  Razz's definitely has some talent in their kitchen and reccomend you try this restaurant.
