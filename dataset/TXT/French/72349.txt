XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q I was here for my birthday this past weekend, and it was incredible.  My husband and I both did the 16 course L'Hiver (winter) menu, which we prepared for my eating very little all day. The service was impeccable (one of the servers even recognized us from a previous visit), and the sommelier Niko (pronounced Niku) was exceptionally helpful recommended wines we'd like based on our preferences.
I have to be honest though, as good as the food is, my favorite part of dining here is the bread cart selections, and the butter and olive oil are the best tasting I've ever had.  I would be happy to eat just bread and butter here all night! :) 
This is truly a bucket list/once-in-a-lifetime/very special occasion place that I cannot recommend more highly.  Yes, it is expensive.  Yes, there's a dress code.  It's worth it, I guarantee it!
