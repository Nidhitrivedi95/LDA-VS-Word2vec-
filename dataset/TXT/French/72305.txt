Having eaten at 2 L'Atelier's, I was pumped to finally make it to THE one and only mother ship Joel Robuchon. Being on Vegas time, we ate lunch 3 hours before our reservation, so we downsized from the massive $445 tasting menu to the still massive $200 two app, one entree, one dessert option, which still took a whopping FOUR hours.

ATMOSPHERE
Vegas over the top opulence without being tacky

SERVICE
Solid, not as tight as a 3 star Michelin but like a 2 star.

FOOD
- Bread cart - This carb slut was all over this cart like nobody's business. The bacon bread was the standout.
- Corn soup w/duck prosciutto amuse - great sweet and salty balance. Damn the duck was good.
- Scallops and shrimp - Someone had to go blind to plate this, a shade over cooked and a bit bland.
- Foie gras - DUH this was good. How can it not be?
- Sous vide veal, morels and dumpling - Again sightly over cooked and bland, but the dumpling was tasty.
- Herby sorbet , can't recall the deets, but super refreshing and yummy. Beautiful presentation.
- Chocolate soufflé - OMFG. The lightest , creamiest, most perfect soufflé I've ever had. So big my friend couldn't finish it. Pure magic. MAGIC!!!
- Mignardises cart, looked pretty and I went hog wild on half the items but none were really great. The macaron were sadly straight up below average. 

Oddly he take home gift was a pound cake. How bizarre. 

DAMAGE
We don't drink and just had water and tea/ coffee, probably had the lowest bill of the night at $300/person after T&T. If you drink and do the full tasting, it could be easily headed over 4 figures. Definitely one of the most expensive menus in the US.

The experience was worth it but JR's food underperforms relative to other 3 stars, except for that freakin' soufflé.
