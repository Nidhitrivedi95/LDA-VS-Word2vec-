The upstairs ambience is a favorite part of this restaurant. If you can be seated in a booth closer to the door leading to the bathroom, you can feel more private - which I prefer. 

The staff I've dealt with during my last 3 visits has been knowledgeable, helpful and agreeable.

One of the lighting devices was aimed uncomfortably into our eyes (possibly from being cleaned), so we asked, and a server climbed up and re-directed it for us right then.

The food is fresh and tasty, and the servers tend to give detailed descriptions and answer questions in a professional fashion. I have always trusted their recommendations, and am always satisfied.

My order generally consists of a charcuterie plate with a bresaola and something close to prosciutto (I ask which current meat is closest to it), then 2 cheeses - also depending on the recommendation of the server and what they are featuring. Depending on appetite, a Barbee arugula with apples & chevre salad and maybe another item can suffice for two. Again, the special salad and meats must be taken into consideration. These often make the meal.

The drink menu is designed to appeal to specific tastes and is manageable. The Queen's Cup - a play on the Pimm's Cup - can even be made with vodka per request.
