I2LcbNXGsMb6zxh4-gmVHw This place is adorable!! its a swanky Vietnamese style décor & they play sassy French jazz. I LOVE it! My favorite thing there so far is the Deja Vu'. Its a super yummy strong drink that's just the right amount of sweet.
The staff is very helpful & pleasant and its a fantastic spot for one of my favorite sports - people observing. 
I gave it 4 stars bcuz I was so disappointed with their Phu soup broth. It was bland and light on meat. But the fixings they serve with it were good. And judging from the tasty smell of the place I assume the other menu items are much tastier but the Phu is currently all I've taste tested. I will return to try other things ( and have a Deja Vu') 
Cheers!
