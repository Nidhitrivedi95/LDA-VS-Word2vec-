mnn--vaYHtNyBNYFYBFIog I got invited for my bday supper at Toque. Let me tell you I was beyond excited and it was kind of a let down. The menu is seasonal so im guessing I was not born in the right season"  August) 
We had the tasting menu with foie gras and the wine pairing 
The only dish that we felt was really good was the quail 
The rest was easily forgettable (razor clam salad, venison etc) 
The sommelier was really good 
Some of the staff members looked really uncomfortable and out of place (maybe in training?) 
For the price tag we looked forward to having an experience close to perfection which we didn't have 
Nothing was bad but the food didnt left me mesmerized. Basically, no consistency in the service and food. 
My friends were raving about this place but they had a different menu so next time I'll make sure to check the reviews right before I go.
