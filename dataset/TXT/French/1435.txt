_T7f2wUgNlJqxsR-cR89SQ I'm usually not super crazy about fine dining because I would rather buy expensive shoes than expensive food :P My boyfriend took me here for our anniversary and you definitely have to be in your best attire and behavior! I usually prefer a more laid-back atmosphere, but this is definitely one of few fine dining experiences that I found top notch, memorable and absolutely worth the money. No complaints really, except the interior decor is kind of bland, but the food makes up for it with the quality and layers of flavors!
