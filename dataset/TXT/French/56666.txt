rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Stopped here for brunch and were seated outside on the patio and was very impressed. Their pastries were the best, all of our breakfast/brunch entrees were fantastic, with an impressive wine list to make sitting outside by the pool the best way to chase a hangover on sunny afternoon.
