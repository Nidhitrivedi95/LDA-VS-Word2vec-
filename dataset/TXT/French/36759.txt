iEsNloJgy-MyA-_wqeB6jg I like this restaurant, especially the lovely and courteous young ladies who were our servers. The smiles never left their faces from the time we arrived until the time we left two hours later. They were so accommodating, so eager to please, without ever being intrusive. I could not have felt more welcomed which is so rare in so many restaurants where servers can sometimes make you feel as though you are an inconvenience .

Now about the decor and ambiance. Though largely outdated, the decor is a bit country French and was probably quite attractive when it was first done. Now it looks a little tired. But the ambiance is nice with soft music in the background, which allows for easy conversation.

My husband and I both thought that the food was excellent. I had the frog legs which were delicious. My husband had the duck and cleaned his plate. For dessert we had the Grand Marnier soufflé and OMG! It was out of this world delicious and the best ever. We have had soufflés in France as well as in some of the top French restaurants in the country and the soufflé at Le San Souci tops them all!

The menu prices range from moderate to slightly higher but you get what you pay for and the quality of the food is worth the price. We are looking forward to our next meal there. Give it a try and enjoy!
