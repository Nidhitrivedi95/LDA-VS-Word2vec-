YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g Hubby and I aren't much for smoky, crowded casinos so when we venture to Vegas it's for good food and the shows.

To start with, Hubert Keller is my favorite chef on TV (Top Chef Master, etc.) so my husband made plans for us to celebrate my 50th at Fleur...lucky me!!

 We had cocktails before dinner and I highly recommend the Fleurtini..yum.  For dinner we shared several small plates and weren't disappointed with any of them.  We had the Tarte Flambe, Diver Scallops, Polenta and Crispy Duck Confit.  We also shared two desserts...Vanilla Creme Brule and the Mocha Pot De Creme...delish!! 

From the service, to the food it was an experience.  We also had the tableside Absinthe and enjoyed it as well.  Our main waitress was very attentive and took time to explain the menu as well as the Absinthe as it was prepared.
