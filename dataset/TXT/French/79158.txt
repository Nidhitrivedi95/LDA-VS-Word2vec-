The sign outside invited us in for a Sunday bohemian brunch, so our curiosity lead the way. We entered just as the duo began an Amélie piece, and I was instantly entranced. 

Their Sunday brunch menu is served until 3pm along with Anthony Wing (of Pure Spirit Oyster bar fame) serving up fresh oysters. The menu was different from that listed online, with some seasonal additions. We had the cheese plate, flat top breakfast and about a dozen oysters. The cheese plate came with three types of cheese (hard sheep, hard cow, soft blue) and a chunk of honeycomb that we enjoyed squeezing honey out of. The flat top came with delicious habanero sausage that they make in-house and potato rosti done just right. The oysters were a delight; we had half-a-dozen Colville Bay and another saltier Atlantic type that hit the spot. Union makes this lemon-infused Scottish Bonnet vodka that went well with the saltier oysters, and Anthony gave us a nice vinaigrette to pair with the Colville Bays. He returns on the half-off wine Mondays, which is a bonus to those who also enjoy oysters for dinner. 

The wait staff was a tad stand-off-ish and took some time to set our table, even though there were clearly 5 available spots to choose from as we arrived late in the afternoon. All-in-all, the atmosphere was warm and welcoming, especially with the gypsy/french music and beautiful decor. The food was top-notch. I can't wait to return for dinner and be further impressed. This is definitely one of my top 3 Ossington restaurants.
