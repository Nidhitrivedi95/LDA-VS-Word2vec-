Tefx_N6A6nrsdj4jHHnbYg Cute place near by medical offices.
The cafe did not offer much choice in pastries ... went there at 9am after a doc appointment, only couple pastries were displayed everything else were to select from the menu 

i ordered the mini apple pies. it was very good and buttery. 
following day i wanted to order some for my friend's birthday. i called twice and they couldn't take the order over the phone. i had to call back when the chef is in. Poor customer service ...
could they just take my phone and take the order???
