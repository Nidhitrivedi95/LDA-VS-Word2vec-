XcWlBj5oQgzKhR7Cxovj3w I will admit, I do not have high expectations for airport food, but I've had much better food at other airports restaurants. The pork belly baguette was mediocre. The pork belly was so overdone, tough and chewy. The fries came out lukewarm and were overly salted with a heavy hand on the paprika as well. No bueno. The service was at least quick and friendly, but I'd pass on the food. Maybe the drinks at the bar are better. :/
