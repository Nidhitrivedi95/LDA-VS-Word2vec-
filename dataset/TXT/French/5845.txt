3OCooCzHgsS2xHdN-dNVXg 2 stars is the a fair rating I can give. The first star is the ambiance-it is a romantic place for a date. There was a live guitarist playing songs ranging from spanish music to love story by Taylor Swift. The 2nd star goes to the waiter who was with us (don't know his name but he was an older kind gentleman). He was very courteous and accommodating. 

Food: I ate during summerlicious and the food was not up to par compared to other establishments in terms of taste. Three of us ordered lobster. the luckiest person had a portion of lobster with generous sides, while me and another friend had a really small serving. 

Interfering, rude staff: When reserving our table we indicated that we preferred to pay separate bills. On explaining this to our waiter, another waiter overheard our conversation and stepped in and told us flat out 'No'. He said it wasn't the establishments policy to accommodate the option of paying separately unless we indicated it in the beginning of the reservation. He than turned to one of my friends who chuckled and informed him that this wasn't a laughing matter and it was very serious. The way he spoke to us was rude, as though we did something something bad. In the end our original waiter came back and we settled the one bill but split into different payments.

Maybe it was one of those nights where things got screwed up and maybe the rude waiter had a bad day; however, I still expect professionalism coming from the staff and also uniformity when it comes to the food.
