Ambiance can simply not be beat (surrounded by 50 + million dollars worth of Picasso originals, elegantly appointed space and a clear view of the Bellagio's famous fountain and light show).  You can choose from two menus- the Prix Fixe, which is three courses (I believe), for $105 per person. Or you can choose the 5 course tasting menu. Both FI and I chose the tasting menu and, after perusing the encyclopedia-sized wine list, decided to go with the wine pairing. 

Since there are so many reviews, I'm just going to go over the hi lights:

1. Foie Gras and sauteed peaches paired with a deliciously sweet Hungarian wine to balance the richness of the FG.  I've usually had FG in something or as a spread. This was a generously portioned piece "straight up." Presentation was outstanding. 

2. Scallop on whipped potatoes with veal reduction. I would have thought that the veal reduction would have overpowered the scallop- not so. Scallop was perfectly caramelized and the potatoes melted in your mouth.

3. Dessert - vanilla bean crepes with cream cheese gelato. Presented as crepe "purses" ties with cocoa bean over raspberry puree with a chocolate hoop giving the dish a 3D look. 

4. Sommelier and general service:  Sommelier personally explained each wine pairing, answered all questions and selected a diverse and balanced collection to accompany our dishes. Bravo!  Service was attentive and upscale without being intrusive or arrogant. 

I will say that there was only one small issue that we had: There was a lot of lag time between the amuse bouche and our first course. Almost an hour. The waiter even brought us a book about the restaurant to pass the time. This was both odd and amusing. Once the courses started, however, all was well.
