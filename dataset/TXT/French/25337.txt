Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA I had a great experience here. Why? Well I was invited to a private hosted event so I didn't have to pay, had the pleasure of some good company and good food, with some of the most panoramic views of the city of Las Vegas. Atop theHotel at Mandalay Bay, the Mix Lounge has a private elevator that takes you up to the lounge. 

One thing I noted. All the girls that work here were smoking hot! Great views all around if you know what I mean. 

I went to this place at 6p on a Tuesday night, and it was more of a lounge, which I prefer to a club. Not sure if it turns into a club on Friday nights.
