_cjPEH9wXhKS-HQe_U3M4Q "French Bistro for all occasions"

I had the pleasure of attending a private event here for a close friend and this place is an excellent French Bistro. It's just off the beaten path just West of Spadina on Wellington in between Fashion District and Wellington Place. 

It's right beside the old C-Lounge which is now Addison's. One pro-tip, there is parking, limited to about 12, but parking nonetheless behind the building for customers of Le Select. 

Atmosphere: 

A nice contemporary atmosphere for a French bistro. It has the feel of a place you can go for a nice date night or a drink after work. Atmosphere has a very nice upscale casual feel with lots of wood accents, and wine bottles adorning the walls all around. There is a nice dining area, private dining area in the back you can potentially book, and a patio/outdoor area in the back which would make a nice place to sit for brunch in the summer.

The servers all speak French and are very helpful.

Food: 

Food was well presented as can be expected by a French Bistro, but there is a selection of classics with modern twists like Duck, Steak, salmon, and tarts. We had a prix fixe menu that featured a Kale and Goat Cheese Salad (refreshing), Goat Cheese and mushroom tart salad, Sirloin flap steak with jus, Duck, Creme Brule, and Fruit platter.

All items were delicious, though the steak was overpowered by the Onion jus, and could've stood on it's own without. 

Overall a nice spot for French cuisine and somewhere I'd recommend to go if that's what you're craving and are in the area. Not that pricey either.
