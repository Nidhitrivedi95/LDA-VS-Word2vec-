qr3iie2aA1ddJasU-6N1gQ Best restaurant in Lake Las Vegas!
So thrilled to have this new addition to the Village.
Beautiful views of the lake and the bridge...very romantic at night.
The cuisine is French with a Mediterranean/Italian flair.
We have been several times.... the Salmon Penne in a vodka sauce it the best
I have ever had.. also a must... the Octopus appetizer..
succulent flavors. But the Grilled Branzio (European Sea Bass) served table side
is my favorite dish... very light and delicate...
Très bon!!!
