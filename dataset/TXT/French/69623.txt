I had the combination eggs Benedict which was as straight forward as a Benedict gets. It came with potatoes and fruit. That and a mimosa was $26. My friend got the universal breakfast that came with 2 eggs, 2 large crepes, potatoes, bacon, beans, some weird pate of some sort and bread. She also got a waffle. That and orange juice totaled about $36. The hollandaise sauce on my benefit was pretty plain so I did use a lot of salt, and my friend said her crepes were too rubbery and heavy. Even though the food was okay, I would definitely come back and try something else on their menu. Our waitress was very nice and the place was very busy with a fun, modern feel.
