u_-PMjrCpr9EBRmLSWCEHQ Fourquet Fourchette is essentially the brew-pub for Unibroue, just down the street in Chambly, Quebec.  It is a quintessential gastro-pub.  Unibroue probably has the most solid complete line of beers available from a commercial brewer and here they're as fresh as they come and served along with some scrum-didili-umptious eats (if not 100% consistent  since they're open 7-days a week and a chef's gotta take a break sometime).

The building is an old something-or-other, and has been repurposed as a resaurant and event spot.  The entry doubles as the Unibroue gift shop and upstairs has a event room for all your middle-ages/castle themed weddings and such.  The back wall faces lake Chambly and is just one giant 3-story set of windows.  In nicer weather there's seating or event hosting on the back patio by the lake.  It's a damn nice spot.  It's the perfect place to discover all the Unibroue brews you didn't know about or just can't get elsewhere.

Get a Chambly Noire on tap and slip into heaven.
