4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw When I went on vacation in Las Vegas, I had French toast for brunch in this restaurant. This is the best French toast I have ever had in my life. Thick bread with very delicious blueberry sauce (if I remember correctly). Wow, if I have a chance to go back, I will definitely not miss this restaurant. The service was very good. The patio is awesome!!! You can see Bellagio fountain dancing in every half an hour.
