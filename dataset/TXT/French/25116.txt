Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA One of my friends was really hyped about coming to Mix for dinner when we arrived in LV on Thursday (Dec. 4) It was his birthday and Mix was all he could talk about. The reservations were made for 10pm, however we were late and called Mix to let them know. We arrived at Mix at 1030pm and were not seated right away. I mean we stood around for a good 5 to 10 mins. This wouldn't be a problem, but there wasn't that many people there. 

We finally got seated and our waiter brought us water. As we were looking through the menu, he kept coming over to our table and telling us to hurry up and order. Need i remind you that we just sat down! He must of told us to hurry up 3 times before we ordered. I ordered the Scallops, free range chicken breast and some kind of truffle soup. I must say the food was good though. Despite the irritating service the food was well prepared and had tons a flavor. However, I cant justify three small scallops for $50. 

Also, their dessert is excellent. Their tiramisu is to DIE for. We ordered two of those. This Apple pie type thing and some ice cream. If your hungry don't come here for their entrees, but do come there for their desserts.
