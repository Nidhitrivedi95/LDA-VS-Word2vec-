Really, be sure you get the mussels. Oh, and I dare you not to pick up the bowl and drink the white wine/butter/garlic broth. Amazing.

I recently had a great business dinner here. Everyone was happy. I enjoyed their flat iron steak, which was recommended by our waiter. My guests had the filet mignon and the scallops. 

All of this, plus some great wine ... it was a good night out!

If the weather is nice, sit on the back patio. It's gorgeous and will make that Bistro name come to life!
