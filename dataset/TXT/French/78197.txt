YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g Obviously it's Fleur de Lys so I understand it's expensive but I still think a few of the items were a bit overpriced so I'm giving the place four stars.  yes, the truffle onion soup was amazing but I've never paid $20 for soup before.  The food was overall delicious.  The tasting dessert was awesome!
