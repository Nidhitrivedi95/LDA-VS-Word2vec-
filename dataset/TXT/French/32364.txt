gxMa7j1LXIUxxBoP0osDpA I have been here several times and brought everyone from the most strict vegetarian to the biggest meat lover, and everyone has left wishing to come back!

Service is fantastic, BYOB is always a plus, and the food has a unique Quebec flavor to it.  It may be considered french, but you'd be hard pressed to find most of these dishes in your standard french cuisine.

Menu is pretty consistent, with a few specials each day, but the chef will cater a dish to whatever you need.  Although almost nothing on the menu is vegetarian, friends of mine have had dishes made by the chef many times and always loved it.

Make sure you get the Trou Normand in between courses!  A delicious palate cleanser, share at least between 2 people.

A great place to stretch your boundaries, anything on the menu is guaranteed to be great!
