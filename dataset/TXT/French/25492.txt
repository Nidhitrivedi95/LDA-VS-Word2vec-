Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA What a way to start our weekend in Vegas! 

The topline:
*Sommalier on site to help choose between the exorbitantly-priced, but excellent wines on the endless list.
*Holy view! I couldn't decide what was more enthralling to look at (besides the ever-enthralling Will T., of course)--the sparking landscape out the 62nd-floor window or the bone white interior with it's 15,000 glass balls hanging from the ceiling.
*The service was not up to the pricetag of the menu or its Michelin rating. We were fortunate enough to have a very sweet guy who didn't ever leave us hanging (and didn't laugh when we needed to start dinner with sugarfree redbull and vodka!), but I would expect Michael Mina-level flawless service here.
*The food was 5 stars--when you get to decide between bison and venison on a menu (I chose the perfectly-prepared bison fillet), you are in for a unique dining experience. The creamed spinach on the side was notably good. And we also shared the surf and turf: striped bass, seared foie gras, brussel sprouts, with crushed black truffle. And you should order the baba au rhum dessert just for fun--the moist cake is already steeped in rum, and you get extra, warm rum to pour on top--deee-lightful.

Mix is definitely worth saving your duckets or gambling grandma's Social Security check for.
