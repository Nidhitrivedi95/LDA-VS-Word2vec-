Yp9w4nhUowBU_IS_StFXbQ I had a reservation for 11 am. We got there at 11.18 for breakfast.  They made us wait although there were several empty tables. Finally we sat down at 11.40.  The waiter gave us the lunch menu. We said that we were there for breakfast.  So he called the maitre d who came and apologized and said the breakfast was over at 11.30. So why did she make us stay another 20 minutes ? If the reservation is for 11 am then we are not there for lunch.  Right ? 
There were four of of us sitting at a table during a 2 day trip to Vegas. They are not supposed to waste your time like that ! They should have made an exception given circumstances and ask the chef to make two more pancakes 10 minutes after the schedule ! Or they should have taken our orders at 11.18 when we arrived. 

I guess I had too much expectations thinking that this was a french restaurant with some etiquette! No! It's just another low class touristy restaurant in Vegas with no class
