eDtBCZDo92LqBCIfE45hhg This wine bar / restaurant was recommended by a local friend, but we had a very bad experience. Summary: Excellent food, decent wine, poor service. 

My wife and I were seated with menus - and no wine list. At a wine bar. We had to ask for the wine list twice and the waiter, who seemed overwhelmed with everything, said something about having trouble finding one -- at a wine bar. 

Service was slow and inattentive. After finally getting some wine and ordering some cheeses to start, we ordered four small plates and asked them to be brought out two at a time. We had already been there an hour before we finally got the busy waiter to take our order beyond cheese. 

Things were taking too long (we had budgeted two hours for wine and food before a concert) and the first small plates were taking too long, we asked to cancel the last two. They tried bringing all four at the same time even though the table wouldn't have been big enough. 

The place was hardly full at 8 pm yet the waiter and apparently the kitchen seemed overwhelmed. Again, food was excellent and creative - once we actually got it.
