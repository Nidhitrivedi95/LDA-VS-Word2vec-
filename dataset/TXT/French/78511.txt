z6ZPIpO_1Rx69k9y2DQ7Bw Today was my first time grabbing food from La Madeleine. I have previously tired to order take-out from this location but every time I called I was put on hold for so long that I've hung up. This time I decided to place my to-go order online. I ordered the Chicken Salade Croissant with a side of Tomato Basil Pesto Pasta Salade and a Mini Café au lait Crème Brulée for dessert. When I got home and opened my container I noticed they forgot to give me the pasta salade. The container for the pasta was in the box but the container was empty. Needless to say; I was very disappointed. The actual sandwich was OK. Not bad but not great either. I will say that they only reason i'm giving this place 3 stars is because the Mini Café au lait Crème Brulée was DELICIOUS. I will not be going back to get food here but I may be stopping by to pick up a dessert.
