O66Zy8Y13VBm72ZDhS4fIg I've had quite a few groupon based dinners at Sassafraz, and though these can be quite good, what you really want to hit up Sassafraz for is breakfast and brunch. I've had just about everything on their brunch menu, all amazing. The pancake stack doused in a thyme honey sauce, as opposed to plain old syrup, is particularly dream-worthy.
