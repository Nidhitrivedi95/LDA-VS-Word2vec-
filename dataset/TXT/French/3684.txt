27vF5LESbv4kFQfHZUDCnw Caution: Do not eat the Ham & Cheese Croissants sitting in the display! It was obviously not freshly made, must have been sitting there from the previous day. They did ask if we wanted it heated up (which would have likely helped with the fact that it was dry and stale); I opted out because of the walk we had ahead of us... needless to say it was a total disappointment. I ordered mine with no cheese and it took 10 mins to put together but at least it was a fresh croissant... much better but the $9 price tag is certainly not justified.
