SCklYa_jhihWAcfIn-_chg Aw man I can't believe someone beat me to it. Oh well...can't be the first to review everything.

This place is simply amazing...it is a bit out of the way from the city center of Toronto, but well worth the trip. I had one of the best French Toast ever! I still think about it 3 years later...ok I am a loser, but still this place rocks!n My wife had the best baguettes and jam she has tried, outside of NY and France. We then grabbed a few pastries for the hotel room, and they were all amazing. We filled our bellies all night with their treats.
