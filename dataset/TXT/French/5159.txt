3FlWR_osNPb8dcqLgHebHw Very disappointing. The only good part of the visit was the greeting. I cannot believe that there was actually a wait at the location and they were turning people away by saying there was a 25-30 minute wait. 

This is an unorganized mess of a restaurant that obviously need lava common sense manager focused on cleanliness. For starters more than half the restaurant was not being utilized and every one was being crowded into a little area. They had 4+ servers and every employee was in panic/rush mode. The pace and atmosphere was rush and unwelcomed.

They need to slow down, clean the restaurant and tables properly. Nothing was clean. We had to request a bus boy to come re-clean our booth because it had pancake syrup smeared all over - probably a small child seated there before us. They were put out by this request that should never have to be made by a guest in the first place.

The bathrooms were filthy and smelled like a dive bar. There was no point in belaboring the lack of cleanliness in this establishment. There is also no excuse for the poor quality of environment and attention to details.

This place should shut down until they can find an organized management staff. 

The food quality was ok at best. The home style corned beef hash promoted by the server was clearly from a can and very cheap version that shouldn't be served in a restaurant.
