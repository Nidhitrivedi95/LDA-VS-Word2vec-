50-xiTYmE6NERi-yJ6NvHw We ended up here on a Sunday as it was sorta farewell for my friend. We started out with 2 dozen oysters (buck a shuck so can't go wrong there). The icing on the cake was that they have no corkage on Sundays. I had brought a nice bottle of Zinfandel from my last trip to Napa and was saving it for a memorable occasion and this seemed appropriate enough. The oysters came on nice bed of ice with accompaniments. This course went well. Feeling I would need more than just a main I ordered ROASTED BONE MARROW PUDDING and Steak and Frites. My friend had the 35 day aged rib eye.  The marrow was good and reminded me of the good days when Hoof Cafe was open and used to serve something similar. As for the mains for a bistro I don't think it was anything special. The fries were nice but the my main steak was nothing special. Same goes for the 35 days aged rib eye. I guess I have been spoiled by  grilling my own steaks all summer long and really expect  a very good steak to make it memorable. The wine went well and the total damage without tips around 100 bucks. I mean we didn't have anything spectacular which seems to be the theme for most of O&B mid range establishments which have been relegated to mediocrity . 3 Stars due the good value on oysters and no corkage fee on Sundays :) I think O&B needs to improve the food in their mid range places (they are not mid range anymore for starters!).
