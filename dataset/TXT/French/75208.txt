y0cgy0tTh_C8NWCk0WGgjQ For anyone in the neighbourhood the Rushton is an regular dinner spot.  And we are lucky for it, as you can count on them.  The food is good, it is always packed, has a nice enough patio and it works well for varied tastes - something for everyone.  I guess part of the 3 star rating is that I do not think the service is great - they are a bit lazy because they are always busy.  I also hate that they won't take reservations.

Would like it much better if they could get brunch right - as there is a shortage of good brunch spots.

Deffinitely go and check it out.
