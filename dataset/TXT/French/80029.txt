ZV7t55UEx1LnBOWqTrutSw Classy place with a great brunch menu and a friendly staff. I had the full Irish breakfast and a friend of mine had the BLT. Both were great with lots of homemade ingredients. Despite being stuffed we had beignets for dessert with bacon ice cream which was again delicious. Very interesting place and reasonably priced for such a great experience.
