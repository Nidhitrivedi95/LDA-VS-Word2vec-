htQgj-ANQpZGpIpkkrEmyQ The food is amazing here, beautiful restaurant. I came with a group and we got to sit in the alcove area in the front near the window and it's just a perfect place for a small party. We tried a bunch of the burgers and the udon carbonara, all of which were perfect. The service was pretty good, no real complaints. Will definitely be back!
