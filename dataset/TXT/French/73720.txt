xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g I went there last night for my birthday and Valentine's dinner. I have to say the view was absolutely amazing, the ambiance was great but the food was nothing to brag about. It was pricey and I don't have a problem paying for great food but this was something I could even finish it was so bad. They had a preset menu for Valentine's I had the fish and my husband had the filet mignon. I had a taste of the steak and it was dry. The fish had no flavor and the dessert was a chocolate  cake that was also dry, and I love chocolate ... I was so disappointed I wish we could have gone somewhere else.
