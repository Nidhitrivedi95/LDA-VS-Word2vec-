We stopped in for some drinks and small bites on a Thursday night, taking a table up on the sidewalk patio. It was cozy and not busy - which was great. I assume that the happy hour / Thursday crowd likely had thinned out from earlier in the afternoon/evening already.

Service was a bit sparse at times, but the waiter was polite and attentive (when present).

I had a couple of the barrel aged vodka Manhattan (martinis) while she had the gimlet. We munched on an order of frites and baby kale and honeydew salad. Both tasted great.

All in all - a trendy place to hang out, people watch, and have a good time.
