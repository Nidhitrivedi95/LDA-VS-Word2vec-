C6hljmEZYZw4pA0OJaFOjQ Enjoyed a good salade Nicoise, cheese w/ chilli jam toasty and a great slice of cheescake (seconds were a possibility at one point) here last week.

I'd been in before & it wasn't immediately clear whether you were to wait for table service or not but ordering at the counter isn't an issue so no drama in the end.
