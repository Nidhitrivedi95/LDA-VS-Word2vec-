SpkwuDQChxHlNwfnx7OWUA I thought that the gravy of McD's poutine is the best until a friend and I stumbled upon this place. We were on a hunt for 'out of the usual cousine' downtown Brampton for lunch and with a disappointment of not finding anything, we just walked in to "Poutine" at 20 Main St S, Brampton, ON L6W 2C3. What a pleasant end to the hunt it was. A good choice of music, friendly staff, and amazing poutine. Now it is our Monday lunch.
