9ot8oInkYZTt6wkkGe__vQ Another Summerlicious favourite that I tried for the first time. Overall a great experience!

Complimentary bread: Nothing special here. Although I do appreciate the server inquiring about refills when we finished our helping.

Terrine (foie gras & pressed duck topped with gooseberries and cake crumbles): I'm a novice to foie gras, so take what I say with a grain of salt. My first impression was of some sort of canned meat. However, after a few mouthfuls, I began to appreciate the texture and flavours together. I especially liked how well the spice cake crumbles complemented the dish.

Truite (rainbow trout and fennel fregola): The trout was perfectly cooked - the skin was crispy and light and the fish flakes off easily. The fregola pasta was a bit on the oily side though.

Chocolat (chocolate cake with hazelnut ice cream): No complaints here. I always love a good chocolate/hazenut/raspberry combo.

Auberge does their food reallyyyy well. Ingredients are well-chosen and creative, and the ambiance is posh and elegant, perfect for a date night.
