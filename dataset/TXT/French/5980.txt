3rj1qpgFvkRWtAka17mhEQ The food was cold. Also we went for breakfast, and they only had 2 kinds of muffins. The waitress told us that other flavors that were advertised on the menu had not been made. That was not good. Also, I can't stand when a waitress just tops my coffee off without asking. I had my coffee sugared and creamed the way I like before she came along and ruined it. The table didn't have enough cream to fix my coffee. I will never eat there again. It was awful And expensive.
