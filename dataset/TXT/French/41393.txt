kGOr_D-LNpgZ2M9N8TT4QQ The $1 oyster night on Thursday is so genius and delish. Great spot after work but gets a little busy. The wine menu is a nice addition to the oysters. I did find the service a little slow however, we did have a larger group and I can imagine the difficulty in managing everyone's order every single time they come around. 

The dinner menu looks tasty as well so definitely looking forward to returning to this little Yorkville gem.
