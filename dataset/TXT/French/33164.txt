HiMb8cwGsnFVwYxt1h0RCg A friend recommended this place. It was near La Fontaine park and easy to find. The waitress was very attentive. I ordered the Crepes with apple and cinnamon. It also came with two eggs, a lot of fruit, country style potatoes and a ham mushroom medley. The crepes were perfect. It was a lot of food. It will hold me for the whole day.
