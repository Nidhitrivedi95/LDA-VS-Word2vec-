iwFoA98-OgcdXmNS0LxNOA We tried the one on Winston Churchill and liked it so we tried the one on Mavis which is closer to the house.  Unfortunately, not the same experience.  My wife had the chicken burger.  Not much chicken plus it was overcooked so kind of dry.  My daughter had the classic burger.  Also overcooked and dry even. She said the bun and fries were good.  I had the stew.  I thought the portion was kind of small.  The blonde was tasty.
