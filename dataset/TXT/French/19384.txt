aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw i LOVE special deliveries! My sweetest friend ever went to Vegas for the weekend... and she remembered my carrot cake cookie!!! even after the flight back home and a day later...CCC was still scrump-didilly-umptious! i should of asked for the macaroons...but i know it wouldn't make the flight home without bite marks.
