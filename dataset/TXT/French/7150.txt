4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw WTF..!!!...and what do you expect on the strip....lousy overpriced food with a great view but the service saved the day....:/

Came in for Sunday brunch for mom's bday...and thank God my mom is senile and old so she didn't give a rat's ass about the food but man, the food is "institutional" "tasteless" "overpriced" "non-French" to the MAX..!!!!

Fortunately the service was accommodating and and generous with smiles but with an automatic 18% gratuity tacked on, she SHOULD be happy and accommodating...:/  

We had seafood towers, oysters in the half shell, kiddo pizza, some steaks, chicken liver, green salad, and desserts of ice cream sundae, Chico caramel tart and cream brûlée and the desserts were the only thing semi-decent...:(

Anyways it's on the strip with a good view and tons of peeps enjoying the pseudo ambience in "fakes-vile" Las Vegas....so what do you expect but the worst value in dining....oh well...Ima sucka for vegas baby....:((((
