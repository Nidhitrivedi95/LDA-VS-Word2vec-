rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A We went to Bouchon for dinner on 11/11/2010.  The appetizers were very good - nice French onion soup & incredible Beignets de Brandade de Moru (cod brandade with tomato confit and fried sage). The cod beignets were the best thing we had there and one of the best things we ate in Las Vegas. Our entrees were Coquilles St. Jacque Poeles (sauteed scallops with a black pepper gastrique) and the Steak Frites. The flavor of the scallops was good but 1/2 of them were gritty. The steak was a tad overcooked (supposed to be medium but came medium well to well done), so the edges were tough and it came with a mountain of fries. The fries were excellent but it was a very exaggerated portion - more like the amount for three people. We'd go back, but would probably order different entrees.
