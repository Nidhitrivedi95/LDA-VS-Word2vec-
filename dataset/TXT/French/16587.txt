8ciT6qjI18x9EPtOb-gqYQ Good lord, i honestly can't imagine anyone giving this place less than 5 stars. I would have given 6 if yelp let me.

Where do I start? I've been here two times and haven't had the same appetizer, salad, entree, or desert twice. Coup des Tartes is batting 1000 across the board.

First of all, the prices are very reasonable for what you are getting. This is first class, gourmet French cuisine where the salads run $10-15 and the entrees $25-50 (for the filet mignon).

I agree, the corkage fee does seem a little incongruous ($10 per bottle), but whatever. You are still paying less than you would trying to buy a bottle from a restaurant (assuming your wine costs more than $10 at Bev Mo).

The service was crisp and well paced. The staff is attentive and friendly. The food is completely, and I mean /completely/ beyond reproach. This is by far the finest and most intimate dining experience I've had in Phoenix thus far and would wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who appreciates excellent food.

By the way, when the menu claims they have the best salmon you'll ever taste, it's not hyperbole.
