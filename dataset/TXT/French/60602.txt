SCklYa_jhihWAcfIn-_chg It's cute and charming.  The food is tasty.  The pastries are fresh and yummy.  The quiches are tasty.  It's the little touches that make this place successful, like the very yummy salad dressing they make themselves (and you can buy in a bottle.)  Personally, I could take a bath in this dressing.  

This place is not without its faults, like the line up for a table, and the crammed sitting.  But, if you're in search for a place with character to go to on a lazy Sunday, this place is a very nice option.
