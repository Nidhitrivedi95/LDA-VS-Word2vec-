Dcj69NZJnbJhK-YHP_nULA I was here last night and little out of my comfort zone. I think I'm about to get more comfortable with Monroe street if the rest of is as good as Brasserie V. I had a safe bet with a beer im familiar with St. Bernardus ABT 12, however I'm positive I couldn't have found something I didn't like or at least find interesting on their expansive beer list. Many different beers and countries of origin. I was impressed.

As for the food, like I said I was out of my element so I ordered another safe bet. I had the Fall V Burger. It was amazing, very fresh and I loved that it was on a ciabatta roll. I was also pretty pumped to see Nueske's bacon on the menu. I also saved the aioli from our frites starter and more or less spread that on everything else I could, it was great.

In all this is a great place, I'm going to be back with my beer snob friends who will die when they see the drink menu. The food made even a sheltered eater very comfortable. The inside is very nice too with a great wrap around bar.
