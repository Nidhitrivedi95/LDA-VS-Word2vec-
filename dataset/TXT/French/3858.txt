2B46bRpDh49eDyjXGhL_ZQ My absolutely new favorite place in Las Vegas. Beautiful intimidate cafe. Delicious coffee and smoothies of every combination you may think. But the best part of course are the crepes! The owner is the sweetest lady, and she makes you feel extremely welcome. They sell imported products from France by the entrance, and their ingredients are also imported. If you want to meet francophones, this is also the best place to go. French speakers walk in and out constantly throughout the day.
