gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA What can I say. OMG & overindulgence! Truly yummy. Thanks to the chef! Perfectly cooked & the right amount on both of my appetizers. I'm an appetizer girl. I'm not big into entrée unless sharing. 
I had the Foie Gras & Bone Morrow with escargot. I think I eat a little rich on food  
Anyhow, have to say service was excellent & plenty of them. Like the way they were as a team. Credit to the management. I'll be back.
