63qPRnFAjxtchnSTWBxwbw Loveee the decor! Nicely painted camels on the walls, cute pictures and fonts on the menu (bonus points as i'm in graphics!) and friendly waitress. Fries are crispy and crunchy, and great experience overall.

I had Le Rudolph Burger, which is moose meat (or so the menu says elk) with onion sauce (a lot of it! my hand was dripping with it), dijon, cheese, and pickles (which i took out). They don't stinge on the condiments. I never had moose before, the texture is like beef, though it's not beefy in taste. It doesn't have the gross bits of tendons and fat in the burger like beef does. It's meaty and leaner I would say. There's not a distinctive taste to it, really. Interesting try, very filling. it was a lot of moose/elk lol.

I dipped my fries in Pistou-Rosé, which has mayo, basil, dried tomatoes, oil and pine nuts. Don't regret it. It tastes greattt- kind of like hummus dip which I liked better than the other sauces like Aioli, which had more mayo than flavour.

A quirky thing i'd like to point out is the soap. Absolutely love the scent! Been trying to find the scent everywhere for years but couldn't; it's like a nice berry fruity mix. If anyone knows where I can get the soap, please let me know :P
