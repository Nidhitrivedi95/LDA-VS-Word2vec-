ysJo5Jdo29XOBCnKrbUKWg Three oddities stood out for lunch:

1. Out of 20+ people, my friend and the waiter were the only two guys in the place.
2. The wait staff stayed in overdrive; perfect service, and I'm not sure I've seen wait staff do so much without ever seeming hurried.
3. The food here is superior to most of what I munched on visiting Paris.

Great soup of the day (mushroom), an enormous salad that didn't cut quality, and amazing savory crepes.  Will go back anytime I drive by and don't see a line.
