hoSCYdo-c6aNMyDSYVbu9g I chose this restaurant as all AYCE place to go for a couple. My expectations were not very high, but in the end we have been a few times now so it was worth returning to. 

I find the service to be usually fast, and cordial. There are variations though and I remember the first time we went the place was full and it was hard to find a waiter for the second order. 

For the dishes, there was a nice variety. We really enjoyed the tangy General Tao Chicken and the surprisingly tasty Ginger and Shallots Shrimp. I think the Sesame Beef was decent as well. 

I must say the service and food seemed much better on our third visit - the restaurant was very quiet and you can tell everything was really made to order. All in all, I recommend this BYOW.
