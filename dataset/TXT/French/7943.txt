You can't go wrong with any of the eggs Benedict, but try the special of the day as those are always a good choice.  The macaroni gratin is delicious, not overly cheesy; the smoked salmon is always tasty, not too smokey.  Any of the steak frites are great choices as well.  

Overall, great food, ambiance and atmosphere.  Definitely worth the wait!
