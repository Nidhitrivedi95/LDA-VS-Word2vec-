4 stars= Ambiance

Personally I think the food is okay not fantastic but the ambiance makes everything taste better. The service was very slow especially the seating...maybe that's a french thing....maybe that's part of the french ambiance LOL. The french eggs were not was I was expecting. And everything I tried was very buttery...again probably a french thing. 

Probably will stick to the Bouchon Bakery next time.
