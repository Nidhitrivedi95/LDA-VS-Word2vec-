aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw This location is located at The Venetian Clock Tower close to DB Brasserie. There is another location by The Venetian Theater but it's literally a tiny stand and has a very limited menu compared to this location (plus the other location's items do not look very fresh compared to this one). A very narrow shop, they do have patio seating to people watch or enjoy the sun. Known for the macrons and pastries, they do sell coffee as well.

Wanted to come here because I have yet been able to go to the location in Napa. Fairly large macrons compared to other artisan bakeries like Ladurée, Pierre Hermé or Chantal Guillon (San Francisco Bakery).

TIP: There's a Buy 5 get One Free for macrons (not advertised)

My Macron Purchases: 2 Salted Caramel, 2 Pumpkin (Seasonal), Pistachio, Coffee

I came in on a Sunday afternoon and it wasn't crowded. Employee was friendly enough and was the one that told me about the promotion for the macrons. 

Too full to try anything else. Will definitely come back.
