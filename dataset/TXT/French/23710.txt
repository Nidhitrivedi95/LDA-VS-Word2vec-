cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg I love Anthony Bourdain and was hoping to catch him in one of his favourite restaurants in Montreal. My hubby is quite addicted to foie gras so I took him here for his birthday. We are not big eaters so we went with the server's recommendation: plogue a Champlain, foie gras nigiri and meatloaf made with hare, etc. Everything is incredibly good, we didn't have room for dessert, so we took the pecan pie back to the hotel. I will be back here to try the duck in a can, and other items in the menu
