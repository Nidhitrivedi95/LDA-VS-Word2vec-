37kk0IW6jL7ZlxZF6k2QBg After coming back from a 3 Michelin Star in nyc, my boyfriend and I were hooked. He took me to this amazing restaurant .. tucked in a quiet area of King & Niagara street. 
The restaurant is small and intimate. They have 3 or 6 courses to choose from however everything is a surprise.. they would of course ask if there were any allergies.  
Overall the food, service, and wine was amazing. 
They explained each course up to the garnish and sauces.
Cannot wait to come back :)
