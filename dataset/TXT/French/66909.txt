USleI8g1UVN9-9jm-b4uIg Awesome.  Had the Elk which was very good.  Recommend you ask for it rare as they prepare it a little on the "done side" in my opinion.  Service was outstanding and really liked the family style seating. ( If you are looking for a more private/intimate setting you might go elsewhere.)  The lamb is also quite good and the deserts are super.  A very welcoming and well managed restaurant!!  Felt like I ate in someone's home.  Very rare thing these days.
