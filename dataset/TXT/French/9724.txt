4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw The view of the fountains was the reason we wanted to eat here. It was fantastic. The food was so good too! 

The baked goat cheese appetizer was amazing, mashed cauliflower was also very good!! And the steak I ordered was great topped with goat cheese. The champagne and coffee we had were also very good!!! 

 This was the best place we ate at the entire trip! Would high recommend!!! 

They do take reservations but not for the patio. We had a reservation but they were able to accommodate out requests for the patio with no wait! Staff is all very friendly!!!
