Get the hanger steak.

If looking for white wine, try their white malbec  - no idea there was such a thing.

The tiny kitchen downstairs reminded me of my line cook days - Organized chaos with, what I assume was the sous, keeping the the train on the tracks.

Had a great time and an excellent meal.
