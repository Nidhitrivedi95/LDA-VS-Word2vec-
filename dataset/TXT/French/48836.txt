The pianist attracts the crowd, occasionally multitasking with his iPhone, speaking with guests that are dropping by.   The colorful art installation suspended from the ceiling created by Chihuly takes my breath away as does the dessert and drink offerings.   

The macarons are memorable. They are set apart from the others in a distinctive way.   What is unusual is that they are filled with fresh fruit which just adds to the unique flavor and visual surprise.  

Enjoyed it here so much I returned the following evening for a repeat performance.
