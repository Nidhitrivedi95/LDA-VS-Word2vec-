4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Today must have been an off day... Being a local I've eaten here many times and like to take guests here.  We waited for a table for 5 outside with out of town guests, checked with the host stand after waiting double the time quoted and was informed the table was paying.  The hostess immediately asked to wait outside.  We asked if there was a bar we could get a drink at while we wait?  George the bar tender was polishing glasses and I had to ask if I could order a drink, he asked if we were 21 and then continued to polish glasses and talk small talk.  I had to ask again and he annoying raised his voice and changed his tone and said, yes yes I said you could what do you want?  Hoping lunch would make up for the rude service, 2 of us ordered the steak sandwich and the bread came over done, very hard to bite into, cut up my mouth.  They usually serve a basket of the best French fries and both of us had a very small pile on our plates that looked like it was from the bottom of the basket all burned and very crispy almost like kettle chips.  To top it off our server came to clear plates and asked if we were done, my mom said yes we are through, our server responded with, are you sure you ate everything but that one bite?  
So many places to eat in Las Vegas why come somewhere and get treated rudely?
