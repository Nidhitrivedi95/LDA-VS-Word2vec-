t5QPwHMuPQn_kN809Ir6TQ I had their egg and cheese croissant. It was well seasoned and the croissant was fresh and flaky. The view from the outdoor sitting area was appealing. The only downside was they didn't have a high chair for kids available. I assumed all sit down restaurants/cafes would have them.
