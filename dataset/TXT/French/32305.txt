gwlgv3yZ_B0Mk9aLcwTpSw Average restaurant at best. Private room available.  Waiter arguing about why my friends flank steak shouldn't be cooked to his well done taste. Some free advice to all waiters, give the customer what they want, you aren't the one eating it. Pork was like rubber, couldn't cut it with the butter knife. No steak knives provided.  Service was quick and efficient. Manager shows up and states that they will make an exception and allow us to order from the regular menu but it will take very long.  What is the difference if a group of 12 order from the a la carte menu versus 3 tables of 4 order the same? Never seen a restaurant go out of their way to educate how their food should be eaten or what to order. Will not return. Over priced and tasteless food served by arrogant people.
