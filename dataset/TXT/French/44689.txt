mnn--vaYHtNyBNYFYBFIog Yes delicious!  Atmosphere is upscale casual and quite cozy. Wine selection is spectacular. Enjoyed a bottle of the Penfold Grange -- which was absolutely delicious!  I chose the squash soup - light and tasty; the seared tuna -- delicious but over cooked; and the fruit sorbet - refreshing. Service far exceeded food.
