0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g Just phenomenal. From the extremely attentive service to the amazing wine pairings to the melt in your mouth foie gras, everything was top notch. On every wall there is an original Picasso and out the windows you can see the Bellagio fountain show. Our dinner started with an amazing croquette amuse, then a beautiful lobster salad, a delicious seared scallop, to the best foie gras I've ever had, to a perfectly cooked lamb. The dessert itself was art as well. I'm running out of adjectives to describe how great the food was but this experience is one for the books. If you get a chance to get here, make sure you do it! Be prepared to pay top dollar but it's worth it. I will definitely be back here!
