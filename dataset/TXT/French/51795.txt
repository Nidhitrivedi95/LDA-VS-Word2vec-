pmoIMK8zGWvKsVOPDBYfzg We dropped in here a few nights ago. We got lucky and hit the two for one drink specials. 

The atmosphere is very chill and I felt comfortable as soon as I sat down.

Our bartender was by far one of the coolest that we have had in a long time! I wish remembered his name since we spent 3 hours with the guy (Just ask for the guy who used to live in Lake Tahoe) He is kind and full of great stories. He made some fantastic cocktails including a lychee martini and a chill thyme drink that was ridiculously tasty. 

It was our anniversary and at the bartender made us feel so special! 

I totally enjoyed this place and will hit it up the next time I am in Vegas!
