KxUczoGoAwkX9mSHwWlUAw Went here Saturday night. Although we had a reservation, we were told we could only sit on the patio, no choice. Restaurant was empty. Soon realized it was reserved for hordes of bachelorette parties. 
Waitress was incredibly rude and dismissive (seemed like she wasn't crazy about speaking English either). She didn't listen to what I asked for and brought me a different drink, and then was super rude about changing it. 
I asked if any vegetarian options were available. Generally I'm very easy going and will just have some sides if the kitchen is too busy to make something. She said no. Nothing. No "you could have this or this". She was equally rude to the tables on either side of us, so at that point we decided to cut our losses and paid for our drinks. She charged for the more expensive drink she had brought instead of the one I had asked for. We paid the 40 bucks and went across the street to have a lovely waitress and a meal of sides from other dishes. No problem. This place sucks. Bad attitude and bad waitresses.
