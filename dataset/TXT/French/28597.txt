eJ9L40jm5VOXCIq7xs9kQw Best French restaurant in Montreal. Classic decor in a hotel and very classy ambience. Don't get deterred by the construction going on around rhe neighborhood. Food is cooked in a very sophisticated way with a variety of fancy ingredients to offer. Must go place in Montreal for a classic and high-end French experience! Totally overlooked other 3-4 star French places we have been so far in Montreal and Quebec City.
