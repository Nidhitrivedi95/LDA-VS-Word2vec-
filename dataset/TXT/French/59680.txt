S50I4XsBmsWP1PNr_Q-StA I love French food. Pierre Victoire reminded me why..

My husband and I had booked a table for lunch on Sunday afternoon and it was already quite busy when we arrived. I didn't know it was a special occasion for the restaurant, but they offered a 3 course meal from a set menu for only £5.90 to celebrate their 25 year anniversary. What a fantastic offer!

The service was very swift and efficient. They brought bread and butter to the table. I chose a starter of brioche with mushrooms and smoked salmon. It was creamy and quite rich, comfort food. My main course was slow cooked beef with mashed potatoes and vegetables. The meat was falling off, you could see it had enjoyed a long slow cook. 
For dessert I had a chocolate mousse. It was so light and delicious.. Heaven on plate.

The service was so friendly. Despite it being so busy in the restaurant, they had time to ask customers whether they had enjoyed their food. And the waiter had a smile on his face. Also, the portion sizes were just right.

This is why I will return, to sample more of their offerings - soon :)
