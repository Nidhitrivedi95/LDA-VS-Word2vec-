or4UVDjXEEjze3wNPjoAZA I. loved. this. place.
my favorite spot I tried while in AZ this week. it was so good I was longing for my favorite Uptown girl to be there dining with me.

i started off with a cocktail called rye direction. that was definitely a step in the...

I had the Scottish salmon with onion ravioli. every last bite had more flavor than Public Enemy. I was blown away and damn near licked the plate clean. and then to follow it up with the bread pudding - which is such an understatement, because it is so, so much more. I forget how it is referred to in French; please accept my apologies.

my colleague ordered the chocolate soufflé that was oooooowee goodie good. (I finish off all of her desserts after she has a couple bites.)

this would be a great date spot. 
I would definitely come here again if ever in the area.
