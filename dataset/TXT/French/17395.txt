I have always enjoyed their wine and cheese for a casual lunch-snack or their delectable breakfasts - Croque Monsieur being my favorite! Or even simply a cappuccino or bowl of cafe au lait. Now I know I've given you quite a few options, but that's just it, I have never been disappointed! It's a lovely neighborhood, great atmosphere, and has a variety of choices for a reasonable price!
