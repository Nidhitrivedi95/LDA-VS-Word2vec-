Love the Distillery District.  The Boiler House has a great interior/exterior, blah blah blah.  Love the bar and the selection of scotches and booze in general.

I thought the brunch here was mediocre at best.  Presentation is good, but flavours never really hit home.  Everything is just...enh.  THEN I discovered the price per person (managed to take the in-laws here and they always picked up the bill).  Big, dry raspberry for the brunch.

EDIT - If I offered unlimited Eggs Benny, I may have to jack the prices, too.  But I'd make them tasty.

Dinner - I have to say I've enjoyed my experiences.  For years I have been warned against going with big groups as it is a shit-show for staff to try and get the correct orders out in time and to the right people.

Sweet breads were delicious, the ahi tuna was good but kaffir lime either doesn't register on my palate, or there just isn't enough to register the addition to the plate.  Wine selection changes every so often (I like this) and on this night, the wife decided on the $60 glass of Chateau Sacre Bleu! (I made that name up for effect).  She said it was "nice"...it should have come with a small Frenchman, extolling her fine choice of husband.

Live music is a nice touch and definitely adds to the atmosphere, but tends to get reeeeeaaally loud some nights.  So good, I ended up asking their classical-guitar guy Tonino to play at our wedding at Thompson Landry Gallery, a cobblestone's throw from this place.

In a nutshell: Pretty place, but don't go for brunch or a dinner with a group of more than 4.
