ZdaZwXC0FByDY3EwNELphw Really great spot for brunch. We came just as they opened, and were seated in their outdoor patio. We had the Union Salad, and the BBQ Rib Benny - both were delicious! The freshly squeezed Mimosas were fantastic too. Would give 5 stars if it weren't for the cost of everything!
