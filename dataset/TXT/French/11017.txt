4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw If you're like me who would rather not dine buffet-style and who detests waiting in long lines for a table in a restaurant, Mon Ami Gabi provides an excellent alternative for food when you're in Vegas. Compared to the long line at the buffet in Paris Vegas inside the building, Mon Ami Gabi had tables immediately available when I visited over Fourth of July weekend. Seating on the porch was great to catch the fountain shows in the afternoon at Bellagio right across from the street, and the mist on the porch helped keep the temperature down even though tables were outside while it was over 100 degrees in the city.
