rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A The signs proclaim "Best Breakfast in Las Vegas".  In a town where every show purports to be the "Show of the Year", Bouchon lives up to the hype.  

Disclosure: we were on the VIP list because my girlfriend works for the chef's brother, however, we paid for our entrees and I saw the other tables get the same level of service that we did, so the only difference between the VIP treatment and the unwashed masses is a plate of pastries, a yogurt parfait, and a charcuterie plate.

But that pastry sampler is an excellent place to start.  The cream cheese danish was something that I'd happily roll around naked in.  The pastry was light, airy, and flaky.  The cream cheese was light, and more like a sugary custard than the filling that you might get elsewhere.  The GF loved the sticky bun.  You could make a meal out of the pastries alone.

The yogurt parfait was kind of lost on me.  It was sweetened with fresh strawberries, which I'm sure would make most people happy, but since I don't eat that fruit, it didn't move me.

On the suggestion of the waiter, I ordered the Chicken with Waffles.  This is a dish that I would normally pass on (what does chicken have to do with waffles anyway) but the waiter's description intrigued me and I'm glad I took the advice.  It's a good balance of savory and sweet, with chives mixed into the sourdough waffles and a half chicken.  Tip:  let the maple syrup mix with the sauce that you pour over the chicken.  It's awesome.

Service was top-notch.  Granted, we were on the VIP list, so they were sucking up to us and we had a team of people swarming over our table from time to time, but looking around, they did that for everyone.  And for the price you pay at Bouchon, you deserve that kind of treatment.

The restaurant is easy to find if you're arriving at the Venetian by cab (the elevator is right off the main check-in desk), but if you're walking in from the strip through the casino, you'll probably get lost.
