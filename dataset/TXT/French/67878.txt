V0iYi5OjdRcz82m95jV7vQ Okay I've been dying to try this place since I heard about it. I had not tried their pastries from the farmers market before but I know they're very popular. So I went in and got a range of samplings!! A chocolate croissant which was recommended by the super nice sales girl and it was divine!! Probably the best croissant I've gotten in Charlotte. I also got an apple tart and again it was sooo good!! Above all it wasn't too sweet and it was just so real tasting. The ingredients I think must be really well chosen. I also got some meringues. These I wasn't so impressed with. They were hard as rocks the entire way through. I realize they are supposed to be crispy but these about broke our teeth. While that was a minor disappointment the croissants and tarts will more than make up for some bad meringues!! I can't wait to go back and try more things, especially some quiche and more croissants of course!!
