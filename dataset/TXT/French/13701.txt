4O8fzz9F-XEsQ-gTMgkiyQ This is the second time we eat at this restaurant. Today we bring family and friends to share the great cuisine of Catalunya Nord prepared by a Chef from Perpinyà. The first time we found this place, we were attracted, from a few blocks away by the Senyera Catalana (Catalan Flag) we decided to go in and give it a try!
The staff was great, friendly, attentive accomodating and very aware of the "Gluten Issue" of our party! 
Any dish will bring the flavors of the Catalan Cuisine from both sides of the border. Paellas, Catch of the day, crema cremada (Crème brûlée) a medieval dessert originated in Catalunya is a great flavor to round up any dish!

This place is not cheap. But you get what you pay for and it is worth every penny.   The selection of wine is good and have a couple of my favorites of the Catalan Torres Family Wines (Vilafranca del Penedès):  Tres Coronas (Ull de Llebre or Tempranillo grape) and Sangre de Toro (Garnatxa y Carinyena grapes) a great table wine to accompany your meets or even fish and seafood! 

We will be back!
