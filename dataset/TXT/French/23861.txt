cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg When my boyfriend and I started planning our trip to Montreal this was the first place we made dinner reservations. The staff at Au Pied de Cochon made sure our hopes and dreams for this meal come true and left us wanting to do it all over again asap! 
We arrived 30 minutes prior to our reservation and the hostess set us up at the bar and assured us we would be taken to our table by 6pm. The bartender was incredibly sweet and attentive. She described the menu to us and helped us decide on a dish to accompany our drinks. We ordered one of the specials, the Salmon Head, which was delicious but our least favorite part of the meal (not to take away from the Salmon but it's just that the rest of the meal was THAT great). By the time we were seated we had studied the menu obsessively and long enough to place our order right away. We decided on  Foie Gras Terrine served with apple jelly, Beef Heart Salad, Hot Chicken and my personal favorite, Venison Tartare. My boyfriend is still talking about the Hot Chicken 4 days later... Yea it's that delicious! Lastly, we made the smartest decision we'd made all week by ordering the Pecan Pie, which was served with homemade ice cream. We ate that dessert embarrassingly fast, without uttering a word to one another. All that could be heard during those memorable 4 1/2 minutes were gluttonous slurps, "mmmmmmm's" and the scraping of forks on the plate until every last bit of the ooey-gooey pie was devoured. Our meal was everything we hoped for and we will be encouraging anyone going to Quebec to make time for this wonderful restaurant!
