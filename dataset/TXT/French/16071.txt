78TC3sZSYBzBsSJ0z5pyhw Came here with a group of friends to celebrate our last night in Vegas before we headed over to Marquee night club.  Nice ambiance but mediocre food.  A bit on the pricey end (ended up paying around $25-$30 per person for an entree without appetizer or drinks).  Great service that came around to check on us and top off our waters.
