At the start of the meal, the waiter suggested caviar but we both got the impression it was either complimentary or a small add-on. He asked it sort of in passing and we agreed. It was delicious but we had no idea it was going to be $140 additional for a very small acoop of caviar. Literally a spoonful of the stuff cost more than the entire 7 course tasting menu. Honestly we were shocked when we got the bill.  It immediately spoiled the meal for us. I expected to pay around $350 not $500. It was angering. I mentioned our concern to the waiter but he didn't seem to take any steps to resolve the issue. We were really disappointed. It's not the money that bothers me, it's the feeling of a bait and switch that does. If I had known that the caviar was going to be that expensive, I would've just stuck with the tasting menu alone. Anyway we paid the bill and left but I would not reccomend this restaurant.
