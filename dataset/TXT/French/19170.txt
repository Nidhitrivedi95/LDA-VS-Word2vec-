aSC-WLyJptVpziJpR98Ykg came with friends for a Canada day dinner... great location in old MTL! had the tartar, escargot/shrimp mix and cerviche to start... tartar was decent, the ceviche was a little too coconutty for my liking but the escargot was excellent!!! tried the duck and the halibut for mains... both very good too! deserts were good but nothing crazy... only thing that was a little annoying was the slow service due to a large boisterous group adjacent to us... and that's always been my biggest pet peeve...
