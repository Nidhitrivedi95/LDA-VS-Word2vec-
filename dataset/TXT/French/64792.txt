teTQU7TIPE0O_B1zN_239w It has been over 10 years since I have been to Mimi's. My husband recommended it because he knows how much I love eggs benedict, but I must admit, I was skeptical. The last time I was here it was just OK, so I wasn't expecting much. However, my mind was totally blown by the eggs benedict. They are quite easily better than T.C. Egggintons, and about $4 cheaper. The eggs were perfectly poached, I mean PERFECT! The Capital Grille couldn't even poach an egg at Easter brunch as good as this place. I think we very well might have a new Sunday tradition after church. The service was prompt and friendly and the food was delicious!
