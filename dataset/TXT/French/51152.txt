p2OvNFiFKnRoWSRON4-lcA Without a doubt, the best French restaurant in Cleveland. After living in Clermont-Ferrand, France for half a year, I was missing the cuisine. After trying other similar restaurants in the immediate Cleveland area and only finding disappointment, I looked father.

What I found was a quaint little restaurant. No wonder it won Cleveland HotLists Best French restaurant several years in a row, because it also won my heart. 

Not only was the food impeccable, maintaining French tradition and taste, but the service was second to none. My only regret is that few of the servers spoke French, but the owner came to visit at my table to be sure I got my fix of the language. 

I highly recommend the Margret de Canard (duck) for anyone feeling adventurous and looking for a true taste of France.
