A8yIKHSI5LFYZ6_H8dZBcg Found a Groupon Now deal last night for Chefydrews and decided to take a chance since I love Caribbean food and I am so glad I did!

Portions are massive (most mains under $10), flavours were excellent and the service was awesome. The area is a little sketchy and the restaurant does not look the greatest from the outside but it is worth a visit.

I had the Bean Soup ($6.95 for large) and the Oxtail ($8.95). The soup lacked spice but after they gave me some homemade hot sauce it was excellent! The Oxtail was the best I have ever had and there was so much that I almost couldn't finish it (I rarely let any food go to waste!).

I wrote a much more detailed review in my blog but am not sure if posting links is allowed on here. If not, mods can you please edit the link out? http://www.cheapdude.com/food/chefydrews-international-cuisine-toronto-review/
