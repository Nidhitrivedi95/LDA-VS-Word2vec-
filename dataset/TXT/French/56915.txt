rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Way better than Napa. But hard to find. You've gotta take the elevator to the 2nd level.

Anyway... we didn't make a reservation and had to wait for a while. And some asshole took our table! Hope he choked.

Based on our friend's recommendation, we had chicken and waffles. Best waffles ever. So light and fluffy... they were savoury bacon and chive waffles. so good. chicken was perfectly roasted. the sauce went well with the chicken and waffles too. i didn't need the vanilla bean butter but it didn't take away from the dish. very satisfying.

my husband had scrambled eggs with croissant and white sausage. don't bother! it was so sad... just a lonely croissant, rubbery-looking eggs and regular sausage. get the chicken and waffles instead :-)

i also had a peach beer which was nice :-) this is more like what i expected of thomas keller :-p
