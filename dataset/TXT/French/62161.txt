SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ After reading some very good reviews we decided to come here for dinner and we made a reservation. Our impression on arrival however was not a good one. The hostess was opposite of friendly. She seemed stressed and in a bad mood and I have no idea why because they weren't busy at all.

We were seated and at first I was thrilled with our table. It was private and placed between two trees. I soon realized it was not so peachy when the wait staff kept using it as a walkway. It was a tight space and each time they slid through I thought they were going to bump my arm. It was so annoying!  

FOOD- just alright. I had the tagliatelle pasta and it was so saucy with way too much pesto. Disappointing.

SERVICE- she started off well and then towards the end was very slow and not attentive.  

All in all the experience was not that great and I would say try somewhere else as this restaurant seems hit or miss. Also,it is pricey so you would think they would have excellent staff to give their customers a nice experience from start to finish, part of what you are paying for correct?
