cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg Love this restaurant.

The vibe, decor and service are all great.

A seat at the provides front seat view of the amazing kitchen and chefs at work.  

Have had their fried fois gras, sausage pot, duck in a can, poutine and their brulee.  

Super heavy and delectably delicious. Can't eat a lot there without feeling like I need to walk for 5 hours but I do anyways. 

Sausage pot is a repeat order!

Their wine list and recommendations were good.
