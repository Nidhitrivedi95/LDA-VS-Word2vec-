Dcj69NZJnbJhK-YHP_nULA After a dismal outing to Cafe Hollander, the new would-be competition for Brasserie V, I thought I should come back to show the place some love, since BV is soooooo much better.

4 stars instead of 5 because I've often found the service slow. But after going there for many years, I've never had anything other than really friendly, charming people serving us. The bartenders are excellent, especially if you consider that the beer menu is huge (meaning they must get lots of questions and people -- myself included -- dithering about with their choices) and they're always busy. The servers are nice too.

Range of beers is great, and I love the bartenders know the beers and will happily tell you about them, recommend things like X or not like Y depending upon how much you like the last thing you tried, etc. And the food is superb. The BV burger is probably the best in the city, and it's taken me many years of visits to know what the rest of the menu is like since I'm usually only too happy to order that again.

Great for lunch, for dinner, for a drink.
