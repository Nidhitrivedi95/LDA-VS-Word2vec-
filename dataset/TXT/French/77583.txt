YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g Without hesitation, this is one the best restaurants EVER!  Four or Five years ago, my husband and I were looking for a place to eat at Mandalay Bay after seeing Mama Mia. It was well after 9pm during the weekday and several of the nicer restaurants were near closing time. We walked past Fleur de Lys and looked at the menu posted on the glass. There was a $59 prix fixe menu that sounded perfect. They seated us without any problems being so close to closing time. The service was impeccable, the 4-course meal was amazing and Chef Keller really knows how to make a beautiful presentation out of his food. We never felt rushed through our meal even when it got past closing time. An Amazing Culinary experience!

I was so impressed with Fleur de Lys, the very next time I was in Vegas I made a reservation for my mother and I. She really appreciates food as much as I do, so I felt I would give her the gift of Incredible French Food! I remembered there being booths on the side of the restaurant that were very private, so I made our reservations for the booth. The 4-course was so good, I decided to pony-up and go for the 6-course for the both of us. And heck, let's just do the wine pairing as well!!! It's my Mom, nothing's too good for her! I would definitly recommend making reservations for the booth. You kind of feel like you're in your own world. After 6-courses of wine and 6-glasses of wine I officially felt Culinary Bliss! What an incredible display of food! Although it was a hit to the pocketbook, it was worth every penny! Top three meals of my life (so far)!
