3FlWR_osNPb8dcqLgHebHw Went with my Society of Military Widows Board group. From the time of our 
reservation via phone to the Man at reception to our waiter Kirk , EVERYONE was kind, courteous and efficient. Our table was all set up when we arrived and we were cheerfully greeted upon entering Mimi's! I have to especially point out Kirk who went above and beyond to meet all our needs, food was served in a short period of waiting, meanwhile our waiter kept us happy promptly serving water and/or drinks. The food arrived Hot or cold whichever type ordered and was pleasing to the eye and savory to the taste buds! 
We were having a working lunch and never felt rushed or someone watching the clock to see when we would leave, and we spent some time conducting our club business, so KUDOS TO MIMI'S AND TO KIRK FOR A JOB WELL DONE
