ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug So.  We're at Paris.  Which is supposedly supposed to be all French-ish.

My husband ordered the french toast.  I mean really....french toast at a French cafe?  Can't go wrong?  Oh yes you can.  It SUCKED.  My french toast that I make with crappy wheat bread beat this by miles.  

And my eggs and bacon?  Meh.  I asked for over-medium, and there was raw egg white in there.  Bacon was floppy, which grosses me out.

The only plus is that this was the only negative food experience on our whole trip in Vegas!
