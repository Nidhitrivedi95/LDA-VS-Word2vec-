rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I really liked it here!!  One of my favorite things is the ambiance.  The outside seating is beautiful.  It's in between the hotel towers so it was all relatively shaded and not as hot.  The service was also really good, I was almost convinced that our server was psychic. I had the croque madam and it was really good - not blow me away delicious though.  the truffle fries however, was a different story.  They were delicious!  I have had truffle fries that were to overpowering, these had a nice balance.  My husband had steak and eggs, again very good but not delicious.  I was really excited to try the beignets but they were incredibly disappointing - overcooked and dry.
