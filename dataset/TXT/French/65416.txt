u-SvRRAfYgpbXZRfQgcTzA Came in on a Saturday night for dinner and it was PACKED....with very good reason!!

First the food: everything was tapas style, shareable and great drinking food.
= Highlights include octopus sashimi, ebi mayo,ramen, "surprise" salad with salmon sashimi and takoyaki balls
 I would honestly say 5/5 for everything I tried!

What makes this place special is the atmosphere. The only way to describe it is like drinking and eating at your best friends house. Everyone's was having a great time with the staff hyping up the party! If you haven't tried, this is THE place to predrink, or spend a weekend night. The staff will make sure you have fun and are well taken care of. By the end of the night all you will remember is screaming sake bombs at the top of your lungs banging on the tables and once in a while have the lights turned off and cheering for it to come back on. 

If you haven't tried this place do it now and you can thank me later!!;)
