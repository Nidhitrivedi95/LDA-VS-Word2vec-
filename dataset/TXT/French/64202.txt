tCSlpwJQ4CZsUEMZeH2SFg Am I in France? Am I in Charlotte? I'm so easily confused after entering the doors of Cafe Monte and I love it. 

Talk about a restaurant that doesn't make you feel like you're sitting in SouthPark! Let me preface this review by saying that I work close to Cafe Monte and by close I mean a mere 3 floors in the up direction. 

I've been to Cafe Monte many a time. On some occasions its for a quick cup 'o joe (skip this if you can because their regular coffee isn't the greatest), on others its for a to-go box of french fries (no judging) and last night it was to part-take in my first dinner experience.

For the sake of this review and your time I'm going to focus on din-din. For a Thursday night it was pretty packed so my thoughts are to make a reservation if you can. You're always greeted with a smile that makes you feel like you've come home after a long vacation. I love it. 

The atmosphere plays a big part of love for this French inspired bistro. Oh oui, it does. My dinner experience was a part of Charlotte's restaurant week so again, I could sample a few different things which I love.

Decisions, decisions! There were too many good ones to choose from. Do I go Coq au Vin (they're specialty), the short ribs (a big fave of mine) or the scallops (mmmm scallops)!?!? In the end I went with the scallops as my mainer and started with the tomato bisque. The bowl of soup was a little on the large side but I apparently had no problems polishing that sucker off. 

The scallops can on a bed of roasted zucchini and summer squash risotto. Can you say YUM?!? I didn't manage to get through it all but I noticed my fellow dining companions managed just fine with someone looking pained as to whether or not they could lick the plate.

We had a d-lish vino (from the headache I'm feeling today, it was a bit too d-lish).

My thoughts: GO. GO NOW. It's a great hidden gem off the beaten track.
