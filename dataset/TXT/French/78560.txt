z6ZPIpO_1Rx69k9y2DQ7Bw I've been going to la Madeleine for years. So glad they opened one up by me. I moved from TX several years ago and was craving la Madeleine's authentic pastries. I heard they do catering so I decided to give them a shot. I now order catering from here twice a week for my office and they never let me down. Keep up the good work everyone... I'll see y'all for dinner tonight. The Chicken Crepe is calling my name!!!
