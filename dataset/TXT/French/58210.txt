rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A This place was amazing. We came for our anniversary and definitely were not disappointed. I had roasted leg of lamb with a bean salad type thing. The lamb literally melted in my mouth. The wife had sauteed salmon in a fava bean sauce. The salmon was melt in your mouth delicious and the fava bean sauce was amazing too. They have a huge wine selection and a great beer selection as well. Our server was extremely friendly and helpful and not the least bit pushy,
Overall, great food, great ambiance, & great service. The only downfall is that its a bit pricey so we can't go every time we visit Vegas.
