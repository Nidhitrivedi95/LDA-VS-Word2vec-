O3OH5IEFMPtz7mPKakPZ3Q A delightful cornucopia of treats. It'll cost you. Over $100 for two without drinks during happy hour. Gulp. 

Regardless, everything we had was delicious, and we had just about everything. A few minor notes: the wasabi aioli overwhelmed the fish lettuce wraps and the taro chips with tuna and salmon were a bit salty.  I did not care for the mango cheesecake, mostly the texture. 

The miso black cod was stunning! The sizzling shrimp with caramelization onions, asparagus and enoki mushrooms in a sweet sauce was delectable and a value at $14 for 6 plump shrimp. The beef on everything from the skewers to tacos was tender and flavorful. We really enjoyed the gyoza; they were so beefy and interesting. Such a departure from the average light filling. This was like biting into a cheeseburger gyoza. Yum. The bone marrow was tasty but we agreed you need 4 people to share the decadent dish. Too much for 2. 

The Chef visited our table twice. We had great and knowledgeable service. I would certainly go again. There was much more to try. The experience will be better with drinks when they come.
