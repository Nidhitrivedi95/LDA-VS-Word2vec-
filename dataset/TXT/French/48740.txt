oJZNHz5UUVUgrZwVBVlpYw We had dinner reservations the night we came to the Petrossian Bar, so we were looking for a quick bite and a cocktail.  We had a lovely snack, the Chef's choice cheese plate and Beef Carpaccio.  The Beef Carpaccio was wonderful, but not a big portion, I would have like a little more.  The cheese plate was the perfect size.  We tend to sit at Bars, they are often much friendlier than tables, and we had a great time chatting with the Bartender, who hooked me up with tastes of several different Bourbons.  It's a little expensive, but really, we're at the Bellagio and expensive sort of comes with the territory.
