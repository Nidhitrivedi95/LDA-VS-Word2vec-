y0cgy0tTh_C8NWCk0WGgjQ The vibe and atmosphere was good.
Service was friendly. 

The food... not so much.  Some things are good, and some things are a total miss.

I had their fish fry... and was disappointed.
The halibut / batter they used was under seasoned.  If not for the Tartar sauce, i would have been tempted to send the fish back in order to express my displeasure.

Dessert was ok.
Don't order the apple pie... the crust is tough and difficult to cut through.

Attention to details by the chefs could have made my dining experience different.
