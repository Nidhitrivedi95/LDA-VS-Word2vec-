BSmqxPbQglQwP2R56OqOag My wife and I decided to give Local Bistro a try after seeing the good reviews on Yelp. We were both happy with the food, service and atmosphere and will be coming back. The cuisine is an odd mish-mash of French and Italian, but that's their thing, and it works. I had the Steak Frites, and my wife had the Pork Tenderloin. Both were delicious.
