X8lYvkI2Yv7f96cz4uE9LQ This is by far the best restaurant we have been to in Montreal and we've been going yearly for F1 for geesh I think 17 years.  I found this place on Yelp (thank you Yelpers!!!) and we were so impressed with it.  From the quaint setup and seating (old garage?), fantastic staff/owners, fresh greens/herbs grown at the bar, lighting, and then the food....oh my... amazing.  I will add some pics but they don't do the tasting justice :)  The chef sent over a sampler of something he did with eggplant.  It looked like a scallop and had a consistency that was very similar.  My husband is not fond of eggplant at all but he loved this treat.  I am not a big eater in one sitting so the server offered up two appetizers as an alternative and it was an excellent option.  I had the Veal Tartar and Braised Pork Belly Carpaccio and both were incredible.  My husband had for a starter the Nicoise Salad and his main was the Pork Cheek Ravioli; both again so great. Oh yes and their drinks are great and creative. I recommend their slant on a Caesar. 

This restaurant has great owners that really care about their customers, they think outside the box but not crazy outside, and it is definitely a place we will be coming back to.  Treat yourself, look these folks up; you will not be disappointed.
