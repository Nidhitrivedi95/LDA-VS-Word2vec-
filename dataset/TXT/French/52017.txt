pmoIMK8zGWvKsVOPDBYfzg We have not been to Andre's in close to 10 years.  We had not returned, as while we felt it was good, it was not great, and considering the prices, there are too many other better choices.

Atmosphere is very formal, and quite small.  Nice romantic setting.   Server was very professional, but not over friendly.  I found the food to be very good, but not great - certainly not in keeping with some of the higher strip prices.

We were VERY put off by there policy of not being allowed to order the appetizers first.  Our server informed us we would have to order all the food at the same time.  Sorry, but we had a big problem with this policy.

Not a bad experience by any means, however most likely we will wait another 10 years before trying again.
