JJ1Ruu37kn66YSWUmCKNCw We stopped by on a Saint Patrick day when most bars and restaurants were full! We grabbed a table here and ordered the sirloin steak with fries, a choice of soup or salad and a choice of tea or coffee was included
The food was more than enough. The 8oz steak was well prepared as ordered. The bill was surprisingly below what I would expect and absolutely worth the money
