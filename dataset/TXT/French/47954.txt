O3OH5IEFMPtz7mPKakPZ3Q We tried several dishes. Really enjoyed the tuna tacos, the truffle edamame, bone marrow (which was excellent), and the rock shrimp. Next we tried the sizzling beef dish which comes out smoking and sizzling. Really enjoyed everything. The food is imaginative, well presented, and service was great. It's a local joint so get out to support it.
