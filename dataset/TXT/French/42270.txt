l2s4DSeQkzkzsmygKAOxQA Decided to pull in for a drink and a small snack. Boyfriend got an IPA and we decided to share the spinach&artichoke dip. The chips were clearly stale but we don't complain often because we know how it is sometimes. While we were paying for our meal boyfriend wanted to just let her know that the chips were stale. She responds "thats funny, a lot of people complain that they are stale but its corn chips so its suppose to taste stale. I personally don't like it but yea". Great response. Don't ever tell people that anything is "suppose" to taste stale. 2 star for the ice cold water and good IPA.
