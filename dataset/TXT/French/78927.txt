ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug I know better than to go to a restaurant with poor stars on Yelp, but I was hungry and the well starred restaurant at the Paris was on a wait. I should have heeded the Yelp reviews. 

We came here for lunch and the atmosphere is very "Fake Paris" with a lovely view of the casino. The menu was mostly sandwiches and salads, so I ordered the turkey burger and my BF had the turkey club.

Boasting a fried egg on top and cranberry aioli, I was excited to eat my turkey burger because it sounded pretty decent and I was starving. It was inedible. It tasted like a frozen turkey patty that was reheated poorly (and I don't doubt that's exactly what it was). It was tough and flavorless, and the raspberry aioli tasted weird. I picked at it and tried to enjoy my fries. They were cold and had obviously been sitting under a heat lamp. I was annoyed and hungry when I left.

My boyfriends club sandwich was pretty good, but compared to my awful dish, anything would  have tasted better. 

If you are hungry and don't want to wait, go to the pizza place down the "streets of Paris" or better yet, go to The Sugar Factory or anywhere else but this place!
