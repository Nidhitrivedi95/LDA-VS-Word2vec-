JezHN-9KKLTMbojq00VP0g Excellent food, service was just right, selection outstanding, food very very good.  Traditional French cuisine without being stuffy or overpriced.  Gluten free friendly for sure.  You can even get the crepes gluten free and they are delicious (buckwheat flour).  The deserts are very good, a decent wine selection and full bar. Only complaint in that the seating in the front by the window on a 90° day was a bit warm but I was warned so it was entirely my fault.  Staff could not have been more friendly or knowledgeable about their food.  Go here.  Go here for dinner tonight.
