Was it as good as some of the higher end restaurants I've tried in France? No, but it was an interesting mix of French/Canadian cuisine that delivered consistently delicious food.

Service is always excellent here. The servers are always so nice and helpful, not at all pretentious. Atmosphere is relaxed and the space is really lovely. I usually get seated in the back near the waterfall which I think is really pretty. 

I've never been here for Summerlicious so I can't speak to that menu but I highly recommend going any other time so its not as crowded. I've never had a bad experience here and I recommend it to friends all the time. 

It's a nice place to take a date or a bunch of girls for lunch.
