PPJiCdWwr3z23tMxgX8ayQ Always wonder if this place was a hit or miss. It was a huge hit. The flavours and plating was exceptional.

Only thing I would change is have the starter of foie gras bigger as the tiny sliver was not big enough.

We had a few bottles one was champagne and we weren't offered flutes even tho I saw a table with some while walking to the bathroom.

Service was nice. Extremely busy place but what else would you expect it's the holidays. 

35,45,55 are the dinner course options 3 course, 4 course or 5 course.

Soup wasn't really worth it ( mouthful of a fancy pea soup)
