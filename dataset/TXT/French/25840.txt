Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA I guess at 29, I fit into the "older" crowd...I realized this after reading reviews from 21-year olds.

First of all, this is a LOUNGE.  Get it straight!  Do not expiect a big flashy club like XS, which is a completely different experience.  We came here after our grand dinner at Mix restaurant and grabbed a table to finish off our dessert wine.  We also ordered our standard vodka tonics and vodka redbulls for about $10-12 each, pretty standard in Sin City. This is a good place to make out with your guy in small booth or hang out with a group of friends while enjoying the music and amazing view.  We started our night off here, then headed over to the clubs afterwards.  There's a very small dance floor if you feel like shaking it but most of all you really just feel like enjoying the dark ambiance of the lounge.

I suggest beginning the night here and warming up for the more intense clubs after.
