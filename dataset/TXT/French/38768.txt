jLxeBgWhLRbII2ACkgH1Sg I love this place! So much memories made at this cute little bakery/cafe.

First off, their coffee is freakin amazing. Their caramel latte to fulfill my inner white girl is incredible. Also, their single shots of espresso are a must for individuals on the go. Their service is awesome, the staff here are always friendly!

Their food is ammmmazing and same with their prices. Their rustic sandwich which is hard boiled egg, pesto, and prosciutto is a fave even though I end up taking off half of the meat because it's too salty for me. Their quiche on the other hand is a 5/5 for sure. Their turkey and Brie or Swiss Paninis are super good too but super plain so ask for like a slab of lettuce and tomato since it's literally bread, meat, and cheese. I definitely need to check out their pastries though and stop eating so much here so I can make room.
