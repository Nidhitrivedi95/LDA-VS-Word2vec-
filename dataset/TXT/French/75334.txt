y8Y8l5MVX58gIUCgJLm2jQ Got to try this place on a freezing friday evening as we were just walking around aimlessly for something to warm us up... And there we saw it... the sign that said tartiflette, poutine and all other kind of food your body craves for when it is cold!
The concept is that all (or most) of your food is served in a cocotte. That means that sometimes it is cooked in something else then placed in a cocotte, sometimes it is cooked directly in the cocotte. (Did I mention they have cocotte?!)
We decided for the cocotte poutine and the cocotte québécoise (deer in sweet sauce). Both were quite good though nothing to rave about. 
The down point, and as other here have mentionned, is the serving size. Unless you take the appetizer, the main and the dessert, you will likely leave hungry. Since we weren't too keen on 15$ appetizers and we're not dessert persons, we did leave with an unfulfilled sense which is frustrating.
Nevertheless, it's a nice atmosphere and the service was really good. So give it a try if you're in the area.
