YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g Horrible bartenders at this place!!!!. Made a very VERY weak drink and then charged for a completely separate drink. Not approachable whatsoever! Very rude and horrible customer service skills. This Was the short skinny guys with the black hair around 4pm. Someone needs to fire him! There are other people out there that are willing to be professional and courteous that deserve this job more than him.

Needless to say, I paid $45.00 for two small drinks in a 12oz cup. Would never go back!!!
