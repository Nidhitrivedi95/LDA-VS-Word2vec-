KNBHGY4rQVuoHxZf_6ANuw Stayed here for almost a week while in Montreal.

Check in was a bit annoying because we showed up around 2:30 and our room wasn't ready yet. We waited almost an hour before we got fed up and had to start nagging the front desk to do something because honestly we were really tired and had been hanging out in the lobby on the couches. Thankfully we were able to get into a room, and our bags were brought up for us.

The room itself was very nice and had a cool view. The bathroom was large and clean, and the shower was separate from the tub which was interesting. The bed was super comfortable and the sheets had a really high thread count because they were SO SOFT. However, maid service was a bit lacking at this hotel because only ONCE was our room made up before we got back in the afternoon. 

Our key reader on the door died but the maintenance man was quick about coming up and replacing it. The concierge was super nice and recommended some good places to eat, but doing a quick yelp search was a good backup. Location for the hotel is quite good; you can definitely walk to Chinatown or Old Town. Taxis are lined up just outside the hotel.
