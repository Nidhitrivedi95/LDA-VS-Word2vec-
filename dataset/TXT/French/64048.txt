tAj-0ZPUATzLHS0KHzXFBQ I have been in La Raclette always on Friday or Saturday night when the restaurant is packed with large groups that I have been part of too. May be this is the reason I can not imagine this place as a perfect location for romantic dinner. Regardless of how busy is the restaurant the service is prompt and attentive, and the food is served timely. 
The restaurant focuses on traditional Swiss raclette and fondue, but there is also an amazing choice of appetizers and main courses that are cooked to perfection and are regularly updated on the menu. The food is ordered as small or big full course meal options. Highlights of my last visit are the red peppers soup and deer tartar. The raclette portion is very generous and preparing it is fun. 
For those who plan to eat raclette, research and choose carefully the wine pairing options. The restaurant is BYOB and the experience may be more authentic if you have the correct wine, white wine from Switzerland or alternately Austria was a perfect choice and it can be found in SAQ.
