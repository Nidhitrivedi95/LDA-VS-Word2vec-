vLkKorA1gPS97Zj0_WKA0Q Friends and I had dinner at Twist on 1/14/2011.  All three of us love good food and wine, so we were looking forward to this experience.  At the end of the meal, we all looked at each other and agreed that we were glad we tried it, but we would not return.  It's just one of those experiences you need only have once.  While the food was VERY inventive--not everything seemed to work together.  A friend had the langoustine appetizer--an array of five different preparations.  Three were good, two were just too "out there" for us to enjoy.  While I enjoyed the "duck and pigeon" appetizer--my lobster entree wasn't what I expected.  Perhaps my expectations were just too high.  Bottom line--it was an experience--just not one I would care to have again.
