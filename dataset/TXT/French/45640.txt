mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q Our first time at a fine French restaurant. My husband and I loved this meal and the experience. The cocktail menu is worth checking out. I got the 4 course tasting menu for around $100. My husband got a few small plates. We both loved our food. The presentation and flavor were amazing! It is fun to watch the food preparation as you eat. There was a guy plating ingredients with tweezers! Our server was super helpful with suggestions. We would definitely like to try the fancier Joel restaurant next door on our next visit.
