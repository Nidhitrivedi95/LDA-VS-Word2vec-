Yp9w4nhUowBU_IS_StFXbQ Breakfast, to date of this review, has never been better. Combining a sunny ambience, whitewashed gold-tone decor, a well-trained staff, and a breakfast that seems out of place in Las Vegas, Tableau manages to stun repeatedly. I could truly dine here for breakfast for a week, eating little other than the white-chocolate french toast with a peach smoothie and never tire of it. The juice flight, while powerful, stands on its own, and our request to be seated in the atrium every time was met with a "yes sir" with little to no wait. It is equally impressive that even at a breakfast spot they provide "purse chairs," lest your mini flap be forced to sit upon the floor, which is equal in cleanliness to the dishware. 

Attention is paid here to everything, whether it be the creases (lack thereof) of the tablecloths, the crumbs that accumulate during your meal (which are swept away as you eat), and the greeting and goodbye, which are genuine and representative of the Wynn philosophy "people make people happy." They sure do!
