mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q Having eaten next door and seen the full extent of what a Joel Robuchon restaurant has to offer, I have to convey that I was not impressed with L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon. While the menu was amazing in concept and complexity, the execution of the creation of the wonderful menu items was over-all underwhelming. I am hesitant to give this review but when some menu items are visually amazing but flat in taste while others, like whole scallops- a "rare treat" to have them included and not just portions of, apparently- are over cooked and rubbery, I have to at least convey my displeasure. The service was the saving grace of last nights meal. The attention to detail by our wait staff was stellar. The hostess out front could use to smile once in a while but I guess that may be asking too much.
