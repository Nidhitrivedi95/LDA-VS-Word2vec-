3FlWR_osNPb8dcqLgHebHw Love comfort food.  Turkey dinner was great.  It was moist and delicious.  I did have to ask for extra gravy.  My husband loved the chicken parmesan. That surprised me because usually I like Italian at Italian restaurants only.  Bread basket was fresh.  Kids meals are free.  My kids loved their grilled cheeses.  They had a great deal in wine.  The service was just ok.  I can't stand when the server leaves al the dirty finished plates just sitting there.   They need to bus the tables.
