The food was a bit pricey but it was very good and well-presented, my lobster was delicious, the side order of fries was crispy and fresh and the mussels were steamy. The place has a sort of decadent aura, it looks very Dynasty or Falcon Crest, very disco, very 80's. There is a bar upstairs but I did not check it out.
