YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g Food was good but the wait was not. As an invited guest to the hotel I expected to be seated at a decent time, 3 hours later we we're finally seated. That being said, the food was amazing enough to make me forget why I was angry for waiting. 

We had the chiefs tasting menu, solid choice but it was way too much food. There were so many dishes I really dont remember what we ate that night. Yes I know, useless review.
