YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g Was very disapointed. 1st don't drink your little soda fast its not free refills and for two a total of 8oz each you'll pay $9. My hubby ordered the pork flat bread and all the little cubed pices of meat were entirely fat. Not a sliver of pork just fat. We notified the waitress but she said she would tell the cheif.  Came back a few minutes later and asked if we would want something else. Hubby said no but it was unclear if we would have the dish he didn't like removed or if we would just end up paying for both if he had ordered something else.  I ordered the ceaser salad. It was bland for something that had truffle oil and anchovy. I also ordered the salt and pepper shrimp. Although pretty it was very counter productive to have to remove the head and shells to eat them.  All the good seasoning was on the shells which just left a cooked tasteless shrimp sided with a spciy cold cocktail sauce. We did order the chocolate souffle which had a side of raspberry sauce and pastchio ice cream.  The souffle was good but the pastchio ice cream was amazing! We are locals but with all the other restaurants we can choose from for amazing food this one we will not be choosing to return too.
