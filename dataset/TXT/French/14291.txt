58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw Favorite brunch place in this city.  There is a wait but it was well worth the wait.  Large coffee served in a bowl.  We were just so happy here.  I understand the wait.  The food is plentiful. The yogurt is different. I've never had anything like it before. I wrote this review last year and forgot to post it. I am so excited to be rerun to this restaurant this week. I had the crepe dish each time. It was so good I couldn't pull myself away to try another meal. Honestly though, everything looked good. I don't usually wait for restaurants but this one has my attention!
