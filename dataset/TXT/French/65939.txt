udFcIcbWbxrO8uLF95WnQg My boyfriend and I decided to finally splurge a little bit for a date night a couple of Saturdays ago. When we walked inside, the hostess was extremely friendly and sat us near the front of the restaurant in an intimate booth. She immediately gave us water, bread, and oil. Our waiter, Anthony, greeted us and was extremely polite and personable. We started off with soup, I got the tomato bisque and he got french onion and both were great. For entrees, I got the parmesan chicken breast and he got the beef shoulder. The chicken was tasty and the sauce was as well. The chicken, pasta, and spinach was all plated on top of each other in the almost bowl like plate, so the juice was on everything. It was good, I just wish there was a little less juice and more of a thicker sauce that accompanied the pasta. His beer shoulder was very tender and the mashed potatoes were perfect as well. Leaving this restaurant I will remember the cozy, intimate ambiance and the incredibly friendly staff that made sure we had bread and water at all times :)
