4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw A little French Bistro on the Vegas strip. The day I arrived in Vegas my Uber driver shared that this bistro has the best steak and eggs that her husband had ever tasted. Of course, I had to see for myself. It was fabulous! I chose to sit outside to enjoy the morning sun, the view and people watching was ideal. The service was so friendly, helpful and polite. I did have to send one of the four eggs I ordered, over easy,  back for being over done however, my meal was all that she claimed, so flavorful and everything else was cooked to perfection. My replacement egg arrived quickly and was exactly how I wanted it.
