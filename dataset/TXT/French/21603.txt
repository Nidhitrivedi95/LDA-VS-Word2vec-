bEVWHtBRYVwqaaNF4mWNYg Absolutely amazing French food.  So authentic.  We were served some bread with a delicious creamy spread (though not sure exactly what the flavors were), and our orders were taken quickly.  I chose the Croque Madame, and while it was ridiculously bad for me, it was prepared perfectly.  Crispy crust, warm ham and cheese, topped with a fried egg.  I felt like I was back in Paris.  My friends' meals looked wonderful too--especially the bruschetta with avocado, salmon and goat cheese.  I will definitely be back!
