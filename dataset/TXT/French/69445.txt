wFIMEwIWzrhCqcS-fS0_HQ Good place, food was excellent and quite a bit on the plate. Had brunch there. Service could use improvement. They were nice, but extremely slow. Waiting for food for almost an hour, got wrong drinks. Also, eating there in the summer, count on annoying bees. We got a burning coffee on the table to keep them away, it worked for a little while and when we asked for another tray of it when It went out, we got coffee instead (to drink). Again, misunderstanding on what we needed.  But at least they were very nice about it. 

Lunch dishes looked pretty good too and the desserts as well, I'd go back to try those.
