Located on elegant George Street and oozing with ostentatious yet somehow right glamour, The Dome is the perfect place to go for afternoon tea, or, later in the evening, cocktails. From the imposing foyer (and fabulous loos!) to the several bars, the atmosphere is vibrant and luxurious, with chandeliers, gold mirrors and, at the moment, an enormous glittering Christmas tree. At around seven pounds for a glass of wine it isn't cheap, but definately worth it!
