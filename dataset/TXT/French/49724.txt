oS96aJIHFWcFAlGHKKXjaw I've been coming to this shop for almost as long as they've been in business -- and I'm so glad they're now around to stay!  Few places in Pittsburgh have pastries this good.  I buy bread when I'm there (baguette, any kind of rustic bread too), but I make the trip for their tarte tatin, which you have to order special, in advance.  Have eaten their pain au chocolate (chocolate croissant), brioche, pastries with pistachio, all manner of fabulous deliciousness.  I know they've recently opened another place in Mt. Lebo, which means, I hope, they're here to stay!
