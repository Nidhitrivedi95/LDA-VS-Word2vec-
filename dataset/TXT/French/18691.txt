AHosGBveeXx9YjsQvdJgeg Recently had V-Day dinner here and this was actually my second visit.  I'm am always amazed at the view obviously but this time the food really stole the show.  With a table side service and presentation it really set the mood and was absolutely fantastic.  

I wish I could remember how to spell the dish but basically it was a sirloin meat and it too was great.  Tempature was perfect and tenderness was amazing.  

The service here is always superb and they really treat you like you are the only ones in the room.  

The only thing bringing this review down to the 4 star level from a 5 is the fact I think the decor could use a bit of sprucing given the level of food and pricing.  I kind of expected more.
