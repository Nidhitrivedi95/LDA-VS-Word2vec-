YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g The mac and cheese was bland, flat, not cheesy and under seasoned. The Caesar was bland and had no taste of anchovy. The spicy shrimp were over cooked. The foie lacked sweetness and was balanced poorly. Meal was bad left more then 80% uneaten. Save your money and go to rick moonens in the Mandalay you'll get a fantastic meal. Service was ok and the assistant manager took most of the items off the check, but all in all don't waste your time it was awful.
