4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Went here based on other Yelp! reviews relating to their gluten free options.  We were not disappointed.  I couldn't resist the gluten free eggs benedict and oh my, it was SO worth it!  Hubby went with their special of the morning.  Beef Bourguignon eggs benedict.  He couldn't believe how good it was.  It was a little pricey, but not overly so considering it's right on the Strip.  The service was great and we both loved our meals.
