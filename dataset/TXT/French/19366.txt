aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw I stopped by here for a light breakfast while wandering around the Venetian. I had high expectations due to the reputation of the bakery and I was not disappointed. I ordered a chocolate croissant and a coffee macaron. Honestly, this was one of the croissants I've ever had. Every bite was a perfect combination of flaky, airy, tender layers with plenty of chocolate. The macaron was deliciously chewy with wonderful coffee flavor. Speaking of coffee, it was pretty good, as well. Honestly, though, I was more focused on the food and wasn't blown away by the beverage. 
The location was a little difficult to find. It's not near the Bouchon Bistro (which is kinda confusing), but tucked away behind an escalator on the main casino. I'm sure there is always a line, especially for breakfast. However, the line moved pretty quickly. It's a little more expensive, but you're paying for quality and it's definitely worth it. I can't wait to come back and try more if the delicious pastries.
