0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g Came here on Sunday to celebrate the hubs birthday. I have to say this is the most grown up dinner experience I've had in terms of service, ambiance, and pace. 

We had reservations at 5:45pm so had the pick of the litter as far as seating preferences go. We opted to sit out on the veranda (or lanai to HI) for first row experience of the fountains. In the two hours that it took to dine, we watched 4 fountain shows. Which we're just the best as usual. Here's a low down on the rest:

Pros: 
Ambiance- it's very romantic and peaceful. If you're not looking to have meaningful conversations with your dinner companions then don't come here. Lol.

Picasso Paintings- The various Picasso paintings around the restaurant were wonderful! They have a binder that you can have which explains the paintings and the history of the artist. Another pro of having early dinner reservations is that we could walk around the restaurant like a museum and view the paintings without bothering anyone. 

Service- on point, attentive and accommodating without pretension or pomp. However we did enjoy the showmanship of the wine sommelier. He was passionate about them wines boy! 

Cons:
Personally, tho the food was really good, I wouldn't have minded a few more options to the menu, but regardless of what you chose, it was all good.
