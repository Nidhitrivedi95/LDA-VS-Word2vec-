Dcj69NZJnbJhK-YHP_nULA Came here for the first time finally after hearing about it so much. First thing I noticed when I walked in was how good it smelled. Always a good first sign. Staff was friendly. My server was fine. Of course there is a huge beer selection so that is a plus for many beer lovers. I got wine and was very pleased with my selection. I got the VIlla Barbi Rosso. I started with the creamy root vegetable soup. I love soup like this that is puréed. Very delicious not too creamy just perfect. For dinner I went with the steak frites. Frites are fantastic the garlic aioli tastes very lemony to me but still great. My steak was cooked just perfect I thought. Big portion. I would definitely come back to try more things.
