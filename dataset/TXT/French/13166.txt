be either on the patio or at one of the window seats as that is the
true charm here. They have taken full advantage of the fountains
across the street at the Bellagio and this is a great viewing site.The
food is excellent and price wise compares with other steakhouses
in town. The steaks are served with FRITES which can best be
described as flat french fries. Beware the bleu cheese new york
steak as it is loaded with bleu which tended to drown the flavor of
an excellent steak. The butter enhanced steaks seem to be a
favorite and I enjoyed that as well. Nice romantic and worth a date
night. Again it is to your advantage to be able to view the fountains
otherwise this is just another restaurant. AuRevoir
