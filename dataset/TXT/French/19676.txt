aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw Bouchon Bakery never disappoints! I've visited them in Yountville, in NYC and now in Vegas!

This one is located in the shoppes at the Venetian, and conveniently located near the entrance to the Venetian tower. I always get the macarons when I'm here. The selection is limited compared to Yountville, but all the classics are here, and the quality does not suffer. Buy 5 get 1 free, so runs for about $3 a piece.
