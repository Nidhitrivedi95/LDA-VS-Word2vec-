rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w As you walk into this place you will notice the awesome circus tent decor and the abundance of wait staff. The place is perfectly lit and looks beautiful from floor to ceiling. 

We where taken in at exactly our reservation time and greeted promptly and warmly by our waiters. The bread was so warm and good. Some of the bread they have here is also available at the belagio buffet which I had the next morning! Every dish is prepared with beautiful presentation and looks like it should be framed.

For starters I had the foie gras which was the best foie gras I have had. It was horribly unfortunate my date didn't want any and had to eat it all myself.

For the entree I had what they called a Rabbit Melody, and a melody it was. It was multiple rabbit preparations on top of each other, including rabbit ravioli, surrounded by spätzle and some amazing sauces.

They have a fabulous wine and desert menu in which I encourage you to try their armagnacs. There simply the best here I have ever had.

The entire meal and experience was fantastic and one I would love to enjoy again.
