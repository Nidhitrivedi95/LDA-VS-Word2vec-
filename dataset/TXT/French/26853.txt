Dcj69NZJnbJhK-YHP_nULA My favorite place in Madison. It's a good departure from the standard Wisconsin fare of burgers and cheese curds. 

I have been here about three times and have tried the moules et frites, duck breast, and the whole fish (it's seasonal, I think). Moules are standard (i.e., good) and frites are thin-cut and great. The duck breast has a citrus flavor and comes in a delicious sauce. There is also a large beer selection. Service is friendly and prompt. Prices are very reasonable. Portions are relatively generous. 

Weekend nights are crowded, but never more than a half hour to forty-five minute wait for me. 

The ambience is good for both couples and small groups.
