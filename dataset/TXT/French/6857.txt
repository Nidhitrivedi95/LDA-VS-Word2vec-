4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw This was our favorite place out of all the ones we visited in Las Vegas. The food was overall solid, indulgent French fare...but with American portion sizes, of course!

We arrived on a Friday evening around 8 and had to wait around 45 minutes to get a table on the patio. Fortunately this wait was in Paris Las Vegas, so we enjoyed ourselves taking in the sights with some beers.

Sitting on the patio was a bizarre but great experience. Sometimes the air conditioning blasting from the restaurant would get too cold, and sometimes the desert wind would get too hot. We had great views of the Bellagio fountain, although we couldn't always quite hear the music. The patio was also great for people-watching.

Our waiter acted a little weird sometimes. For example, three of us were over 21 and ordered drinks, but the fourth was my 19-year-old sister. The waiter never asked any of us for IDs, and only the over-21s had alcohol, but at one point he seemed to think my drink was too close to my sister, so he commented "you are 21, right?" to her. I'm surprised that kind of lax carding policy is tolerated. He was also I  general just a little bit off with his timing, e.g. bringing the dinner wine before we had finished the appetizer sangria. It wasn't bad enough to dock them a star, in my opinion, but it wasn't the best wait service.
