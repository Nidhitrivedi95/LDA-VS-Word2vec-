gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg We stopped in to catch the euro cup and had a great time (even though Italy lost). We sat at the bar and drank their well crafted brews while sharing the sausage and olive pizza (called Fran...something) and the sausage and sauerkraut dinner. Everything was excellent including the service even though they were insanely busy. To add to the culinary experience the decor was awesome; along with 5 viewable vats at the side there were 2 vats hanging directly over the centre of the bar. I recommend this microbrewery and restaurant.
