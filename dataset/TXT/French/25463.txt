Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA Food was very good and the space is marvelously decorated. I can understand the menu prices based on the ridiculously expensive finishes (I have never encountered leather of the quality that was on the bench in a restaurant before), and the location of the restaurant itself, but, like everything else on the strip, I'd still say it's overpriced.

The service was also very good. I casually asked the waitress if the salt inside the croissant that came in the basket of five or so different breads was Hawaiian, judging by its pink hue. She said it was fleur de sel, but then came back after double checking with the kitchen to tell me that she was embarrassed that she had told me differently. I don't know where they got all these French speaking bussers. Does Ducasse fly them in? I don't think I encountered one non-French one all night...

The wine list was very nice, but I easily confused the sommelier and he decided it would be better just to let me try the two I was asking about. He also didn't want to question my thoughts on the pairing with my meal, but I'm not sure he realized I was asking for his expertise.

Despite the fact that I don't think I've seen one venison dish in this town that WASN'T prepared with berries in one way or another, my main dish was quite good. Excellent preparation, beautiful presentation, and you really can't beat a roasted black fig. Paired perfectly with the zin I ended up selecting.

Unfortunately, the view and the decor only does so much. This would have been a great meal at maybe half the price. If it's between here, Aureole, and Fleur De Lys, however, I would wholeheartedly recommend Mix.
