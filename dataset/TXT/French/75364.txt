yAkT-tNGut0rbWlA7kjrdg Amazing delicious wonderful. Really that about wraps up my summary of this place! 

We came for the Macarons , as they are one of our latest obsessions... one for .95p! STEAL! I find most places in Ed charge at least 1pound and then up to 1.50 a macron! 
You could get three macarons and a hot drink for £4.50 ! 
The also serve Pekoe's tea! ( an amazing tea shop just down the street). Pekoe's in turn sells their macarons too =) So really it's a win-win which ever store you pop into! 
YET in this shop you not only have macarons you also have some delicious looking french cream pastries and some super rich chocolate ganache petit fours !! 

I ordered a green tea cheery tea infused macaron, a strawberry macaron and shared a chocolate raspberry ganache petit four with my partner. I had the Pekoe sercha, rose and strawberry tea, light, crips and fruity, which went perfectly with my fruity choices of deserts. 
I cannot wait to go back!  I'm trying to practice self-control and not go there everyday I'm in town! 

Let me just say some people have said this a CAKE place... IT IS NOT. It is a FINE delicious PATISSERIE!!!  So don't come looking for lemon drizzle or Victoria sponge.
