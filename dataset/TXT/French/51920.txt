pmoIMK8zGWvKsVOPDBYfzg Got this "deal" on Travel Zoo for $135 - "normally $220."  A horrible joke.  Supposedly a five course meal.  I think the total weight of items served must have been about 8 ounces.  The carpaccio only covered a quarter of the plate, the "scallops" consisted of a single scallop each!!  The pear for desert was about the size of a small tangerine.  I've never seen a ripe pear that small! They brought out covered plates in order for us not to be shocked until they removed the cover.  Should have asked for a magnifying glass to find the food on the plate.  It was like the Mad Hatter's Tea Party - it was hilarious.  If it wasn't for the bread and butter we would have starved.  Of course drinks are not included.  To add insult to injury you get an additional $35 bill tacked on for service, tip, and tax.  Would have preferred a gourmet meal at MacDonalds.  I almost forgot to mention this place has all the ambiance of a restroom.  No windows - small interior rooms.  There was a private party in the main dining area so they put us in an elevator and put us in what I call the "annex" upstairs with even less ambiance - looked like a converted hallway!  Avoid this scam at all cost!
