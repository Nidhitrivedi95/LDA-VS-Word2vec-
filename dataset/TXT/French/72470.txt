XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q Everything is top notch in this place -even the butter!- It's so freaking expensive that anything less  would be a rip-off!!!

had the 5 course dinner: avocado foam with apple (or something like that), L'Œuf de Poule, a foie gras soup with mushrooms, Braised veal cheeks in Thai bouillon, and raspberry milk mousse.

It is quite an experience. so unlike any other Vegas restaurant Ive been: tiny, dark, quiet,very anticlimactic with MGM or any other casino. Servers were very friendly and polite, and they provide valuable advice to customers. 

I don't know if I will be back. I hope so!! Two friends of mine -couple- actually went for the degustation menu. With wine and tip they paid over 1k. Makes you wonder at what point is just too much for food. Later I learned that my veal had a masters degree in some east coast university. Maybe it was worth it.
