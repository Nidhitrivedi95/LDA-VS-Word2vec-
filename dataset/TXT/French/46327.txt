n4uDGwRGtJ3vW2Adbha_wg With all  the hype that used to surround this place, I tell you what... just walk pass and cross the street to Queue de Cheval or go for the real top food experience in montreal and go to Europea. But this one is a pretentious place with quality food with no soul or creativity. Just cut and paste recipe with too much salt and spice to hide the bland execution. Wine list is good, and sommelier saved the night with perfect wine pick despite a wine list that looks amazing but just because wine that are out of stock are not removed from it.... Great unique champagnes.
