They did have some French pastries, but the very small coffee selection menu was difficult to find, on a small chalkboard behind the register. They did not have an expansive coffee drink menu that you would expect from a "cafe".  The food selection was also scattered. There was a few French items (the name "Jacques" imparts it's a French place), but also pastas, sandwiches and burgers.  It's very nice inside and the staff were great, but I'm not really sure what this place is.
