9iy6scMRbs5ue41XRLGEkw Stopped in here for the first time after a symphony matinee last Saturday. We were very early (5PM). We sat at the bar and enjoyed some very creative and delicious cocktails. The bartender was very friendly and informative. We had the cheeseboard and enjoyed some amazing cheeses along with our cocktails. Finally decided to split a dinner so we ordered the Escargot followed by Risotto with shrimp. Both were excellent. We enjoyed the singer very much. This place has a terrific outside patio with fireplace as well as small rooms with tables all around what was a house before renovation. They also have a 65 seat meeting room and here is a little tip. Once a month they are doing mystery dinner theater. They had a great crowd for that this past Saturday. I can't wait to return for dinner at this great little establishment. FYI there is a $10.00 coupon for checking in on YELP!!
