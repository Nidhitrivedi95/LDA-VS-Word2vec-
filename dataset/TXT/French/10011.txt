4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I was having such a hard time finding the perfect place for me, myself and I the other night while my husband was attending a conference in Vegas.  I finally decided that I'd treat myself to a little romantic view of Bellagio fountains and came upon Mon Ami Gabi.  The wait time was pretty long for a single gal, but I put my name in for the outside area with the promise of 45 minutes.  Inside seating was about the same, however after I checked in I realized they seat via open table.  I then made a reservation for 15 minutes later and when I went to the hostess, she said she could seat me at that time (which was about 30 minutes earlier than what I was previously quoted so...internet res's have priority?)

Anyway, I opted to wait the extra time just to have the view and dang it was really worth it!!  I had basically front and center to the beautiful fountain show.  I ordered a burger (I know, right?) - French cuisine isn't really my thing.  I did enjoy the carrot salad and bread and splurged on a glass of rose that was the perfect complement to my solo dining adventure.
