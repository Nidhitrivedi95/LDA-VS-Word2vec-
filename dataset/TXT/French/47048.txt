nXlKHnArL3_vugmnytsEYQ If you are looking for a small romantic dinner, Crested Duck may just be the place.  Small place that is nicely painted and intimate.  Bring along a good bottle of wine to go with the interesting and wonderful food.  

You are dining tapas style, so it can be a little on the expensive side when done, but well worth it!  We tried the pate and meat charcuterie and a cheese plate.  The meats and pates were out of this world!  The cheeses were very good with some different styles.  You can't go wrong with Crispy Pork that comes with greens, tomato, and a honey vinaigrette or the Smoked Duck with cornbread, kohlrabi & radish slaw with a strawberry bbq sauce.  

Desert looked good but we had plenty and decided to not have one.  

Service was very good, very helpful and attentive at
