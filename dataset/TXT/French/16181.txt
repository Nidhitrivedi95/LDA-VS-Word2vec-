7fHPkHUO_tcjUUWJqP_aKw Went to La Chronique while on business in Montreal due to the stellar reviews on yelp.  My only regret is not doing the wine pairing with the tasting menu. The entire meal was great, the service was fantastic, and the atmosphere was nice and quiet. Will definitely plan another visit when I'm back in Montreal.
