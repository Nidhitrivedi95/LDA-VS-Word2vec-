teTQU7TIPE0O_B1zN_239w My daughter and I ate here for breakfast a few weeks ago on a fluke  and it was deelish! Really hit the spot. Coming back for breakfast soon:)

The Lattes were heavenly and the second is 1/2 price! I wanted to try one of everything on that menu but.. we decided on Eggs Florentine Bene and she had the Belgian Waffle w/whipped cream and Berries Scrambled eggs and  Turkey Sausage.. Service this Sat morn was great and we felt comfortable and had a great time together talking laughing and ENJOYING our meal together..

Last night I took all my daughters and Grand baby and we had a few happy hour items. The Artichoke and Brie fondue was tasty as were the Beef Sliders. The kids meal is a great  price for such a large portion and came with  a "snack" to  keep granddaughter happy until all our  food arrived together. 

Mediterranean Pasta was enjoyed by one,Roasted Chicken Crepes made my oldest daughter say MM and Chicken Brie Dijon wasn't to my one daughters liking so they happily replaced it with the Chicken pot pie she reordered.  The Demi Bread Pudding w/ whiskey sauce was rich and warm and everyone enjoyed a few bites. 
The portions are large be prepared for  take home and a meal for the f
following day.
 
Mimis is like a high end french decor Coco's and the food is fine but not like real Bistro or an authentic New Orleans dinner.
We had a nicely priced and tasteful meal and good family times , nothing to complain about :)

I have been back for Breakfast 2 more times and its always deliciously awesome! NOT LIKE COCO'S
