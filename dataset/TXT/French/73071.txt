XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q I had originally posted a review where i berated everything here from the service to the food. It got removed by the owner/Yelp. So I will summarize my review. Food is good, same as any high end French restaurant in a metropolitan area. Price are insane because its Vegas. Waiters hovered over you wayyyyy too much. Atmosphere is extremely stuffy and pretentious, makes it hard to have a casual conversation. Look, if I'm paying 1000 bucks for dinner for two, I should be able to do whatever I want. An example of the hovering is when I passed over a bite of food to my girlfriend and the waiter rushed over and asked if there was a problem with an extremely disapproving look on his face. I guess sharing food is looked down upon here? Like I understand that you are trying to cultivate a cultured dining experience but this is America, where we eat big macs and share fries and shakes with our friends, don't make me feel uncomfortable while I'm trying to share a nice dinner with my significant other.
