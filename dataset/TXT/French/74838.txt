Xw50tINqzrI_BM_x7_IcZA Love this place - super fun for a quick crepe on the go. Sorry, a krepppezz on the go. A lot of the staff seem to speak French better than English, and it's always really fun to walk in and chat with them. They have a small patio area, but I prefer my kreeppez a gogo.

Service is nice and friendly but slow. I love their basics - nutella for the sweet, and ham and cheese for the savory.
