Fd25lEnclIwyWlSRgkbRfg My husband and I are from NY, we were looking for a spot for good food on the South Side of Pittsburgh and I found this place through yelp reviews.  Being from NY, we are a bit snobby about our food (not that you cant find bad restaurants in NY) and I am happy to report Bridge Ten does not disappoint. At first glance, the restaurant doesn't do much, it is in the bottom of the Holiday Inn which made me a bit nervous.  Service was excellent, always a plus.  They brought out freshly baked bread, and it actually was!  So warm, chewy on the inside, nice crisp outside.  We had the mussels to start, they were good, big mussels, great flavor.  My husband had the duck, on our servers recommendation, it took a while to cook, as to be expected, but when it came out it was falling off the bone, perfectly cooked, so moist. I had the beef bourguignon, again the meat was so tender, I just wish there was a little more.  With each dish, you could taste the great flavors there but they didn't quite maximize on them.  I had to ask for salt and pepper to help out the dish.  All in all, a good experience, 4 stars instead of 5 for the atmosphere and flavor issues.
