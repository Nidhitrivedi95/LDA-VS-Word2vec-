rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Wow! Love this place, it's my first time to come here, I met with a friend and suggested this place. I didn't expect how good it is. 

We met for breakfast and I requested an omelette with only vegetables and bread what appears to have some raisins. 

The bread is newly baked, I'm so happy with it and the omelette is perfect just the way I like it, I love it with hot sauce and it's really good. All the vegetable are fresh. 

The servers are so, so attentive, as soon as I empty my coffee it was refilled. Last like my coffee was perfect. For this I give them a 5 star, I'm only visiting to Las Vegas.
