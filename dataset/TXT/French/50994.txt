OZKo0tpRrgYoLw5mzKmX-Q Having been In France this summer I have been sorely missing the wonders of French cuisine, the garlic, the wine, the damn good food all in all. 

Dining with a group of fellow yelpers they were always going to have a hard task to impress, but they were up to the job it has to be said. 

The interior is a great modern feeling space, with a touch of Parisian cafe culture to it, a great place to be. Noticeable by the French girl in at the same time as us who was in for coffee and some cake :o) 

As to my meal....! 

Sharing with a friend we covered off the duck gizzards, escargot and the oysters. The gizzards were not at all what i had expected - very rich and meaty, they had been beautifully braised and were Delicious. 

The oysters were as they should be - ice cold, fresh and served with lemon on the side as a well as a red onion vinaigrette. The escargot were also perfectly cooked and smelly of beautiful garlic - if I had to be critical would say it could have done with a touch of salt. 

Onto main and for me there was only one option - steak tartar! The meat was so so so tender, marinaded with great flavours and top with a stunningly rich and fresh egg yolk. It was accompanied with frankly the best chips I have had in a long time - the group all came to conclusion they had been cooked in duck fat! Ooooober tasty! The salad if a little tired looking was tasty - perhaps some seasonal greens would be nicer...? 

At the end of this I was very full but did enjoy a lovely brandy coffee and a nibble of Jenny L's rum soaked prunes which were delicious as was Joe A's cheesecake! Something to be tried on my next visit! 

JD = very happy man!!
