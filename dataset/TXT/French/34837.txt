HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw Dined here with a party of 18 and we had a special reservation in their private room.  The restaurant has a nice atmosphere, very casual with dark colors.  We had the chef pick our menu since one of our group members was friends /w the executive chef.  We tried about 10 dishes total and most of them were really good.  Oysters/Shrimp cocktail very fresh.  Salmon tartare yummy.  Poached egg salad /w lardons - really loved how the egg broke and egg yolk spewed into the salad and sauce, perfect combo.  Bone marrow with oxtail jam - bone marrow was very weird tasting.. some people described it as having the taste of bleach..hmmm oxtail jam was very scrumptious.  Escargot baked in puff pastry was very garlicky good.  Flat bread pizza was meh.  Fried skate with green beans and capers was just okay.  A lot of people loved it but I felt like the fish was very basic and nothing special.  Moules Frites - Mussels were fresh and great in their cream sauce.  French Fries were average - can't compare to Bouchon.  The Beef Bourguignon was pretty good actually - beef was very tender on the potato puree was very nicely prepared.  I would order this as a normal entree normally.  

The piece de resistance was their tomahawk steak for two.   The thing is huge and tastes great but came too late as everyone was super full to enjoy it.  It's a Saturday night special and would be awesome if it had came earlier actually.  Very tender meat and nicely garnished with garlic butter (see my picture).  

Dessert consisted of Apple Tart Tanin with vanilla bean ice cream, Chocolate Pot du Crème, and Profiteroles (cream puffs).  All three desserts were good but the cream puffs were unanimously voted best tasting.    

Minus 1 star for single use bathrooms.  The MENS line is 3-4 people deep at times...uhhh hello!?
