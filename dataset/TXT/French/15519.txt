6fPQJq4f_yiq1NHn0fd11Q They have unique menu for crepes. One of those is the spinach artichoke crepe that is absolutely fantastic. Their banana nutella crepe is too sweet though with not enough bananas. We have also tried their pastrami reuben which is $14,not as good as the one in Gandolfos. But overall i will definitely return for the spinach artichoke crepe.
