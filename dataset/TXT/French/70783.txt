XbG4OgFoaSIxQxVRhTxU2w Came to Kitchenette with a large group for a Bachelorette party and man am I glad we did! The food was incredible, the service was delightful, and the ambiance of the restaurant was lovely. The kitchen faces out to the seating area so you can enjoy all the delicious smells as your meal is being prepared. Between everyone in the group, we ordered scallops, tuna, and beef and we all LOVED our dishes. 

Besides for the food though, out of all the restaurants we went to during our 4-day trip (so quite a few places), all of which knew that there was a bride-to-be in our group, this was the only place to do something thoughtful for her by dressing up the table and her chair with a disco bar and feathers. They went above and beyond!
