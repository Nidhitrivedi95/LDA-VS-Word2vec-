XOWTpGlGEnsOSVl9-OXjSw Came for brunch. Used to hit up this spot when it was still called "pâtisserie rhubarb." The Pastry shop has been moved down the street, but you can still get the brunch fare and more at the newly named "comptoir rhubarb" 

In contrast to the old style menu where you would get a scone, main plate, drink, and dessert, the new menu proposes ordering multiple plates. The number of options have been increased, and plate range from 6-8$, a VERY reasonable price given the quality!! We got 2 plates each along with coffees. 

Would recommend calling and reserving ahead. Best for small groups ideally 2 or 4. 

Excited to come for happy hour and try their "bar salée" menu, cocktails, and private import wine list !!
