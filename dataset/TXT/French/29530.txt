f4vb5tv60WaBcwzRhKpANA Ate breakfast here this morning and really enjoyed it. I split the Belgian panini with my husband and it was really good. It's just Black Forest ham and Gouda, but it was yummy. It came with a little side salad that had some cherry tomatoes, little egg, and ranch. It was very fresh tasting. We got the strawberry pastry, chocolate cream pastry, cinnamon pastry, and mini croissant. They were all delicious. The girls working were very nice and helpful when ordering.  Good came out really fast.  We can't wait to come back!
