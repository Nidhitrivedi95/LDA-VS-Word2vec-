UxWH8zRYIBgs6Q2oykvRdw Cluny is a beautiful restaurant with lots of character but are you going to have a mind blowing culinary experience? No.

I was here with a couple of friends, one of which I haven't seen in years. The restaurant was a topic of conversation because of how well it is decorated. From the floor to the ceiling, there's much to look at.

Our brunch however, was below mediocre.

I ordered the Smoked Salmon & Cultured Butter Tartine which was literally 3 pieces of toast with smoked salmon on it. Their "artisan salad" was also a lettuce core cut in half with sauce drizzled on it. We get that they were trying to give the impression of the food being fancy, but maybe change up the salad.

Their service however was impeccable, and I would come back not for the food, but for coffee and dessert.
