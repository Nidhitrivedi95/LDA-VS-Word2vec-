_T7f2wUgNlJqxsR-cR89SQ Nothing prepared me for the view. I read the reviews and I've been around enough to not get blown away by things much. Well. I was knocked over. 
Honestly go for just the view. It's worth the $$$$.

The food is classic Canadian fine dining, that weird half way point between french and Italian. The ambiance is like a high end gallery, corporate but not in a cold way. 

Anyway, the Fois Gras was heavenly, simple and clean. Beautiful seasonal veggies and a simple crisp potato latke. Followed with a Chinook salmon special that was exceptionally prepared, raw at the center and crisped edges, my mouth is watering. The sauce was a citrus cream that was so delicate and sublime it erases bad child hood memories.

Not really a cocktail place. Stick to their menu, it's pretty well flushed out but I'd love to see some tequila cocktail on there. The wine list is very well rounded as well, though I was expecting a little more Italian repping. 

I took away one star bc the service, while excellent from the entire staff, was exceedingly slow at times from our main server, never returning to see how the meal was, not really checking in and I had to wait a fair length of time to be able to ask for a drink. 
That being said, he may have been over worked as the place was busy. 

Cannot wait to visit again and again.
