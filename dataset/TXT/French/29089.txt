EPb3FWs3mxQLUjGeMNP0SQ A couple of my girlfriends and I decided to try this 'trendier' restaurant in the Old Port. We expected the prices for food and drinks to be a bit higher than on average, but we also expected the service to be up to par as well. Great food, but awful service. 

The gentleman who was serving us apparently did not want us to enjoy the lounge's exquisite drink list, because he walked away with all the drink menus after we order our initial beverage. Once we got the drink menu back, not once on his own did he ask us if we wanted to re-order. 
Couple more hiccups throughout the meal: wrong order, lacking utensils etc. Not at all what we expected at a restaurant which advertises as having " wonderful service in an uplifting setting." 

Overall, ok ambiance, good food, but again, very poor service. 
As my friend put it "Eating in a restaurant where you're paying over $10 per drink, my straw should have never hit the bottom of my glass." 

Consensus among my friends: we will not be returning.
