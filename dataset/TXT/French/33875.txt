The staff was friendly and brought out food our in a timely manner. My friend and I were the last ones there until closing and they never made any attempt to hurry us out  or make it seem like we were inconveniencing them in any way. Oliver even came over to chat for a bit and refilled my friend's ice tea before we headed out. I had the turkey sandwich and the green juice, both were yummy and I'll be back in the future to try more food!
