XgkTmVrlHHO5g96AfOAfpw Came here for an impromptu dinner after a happy hour elsewhere. We had high hopes and were not disappointed. The pate trio was amazing. The waiter gave great recommendations. Great French flavors and was well worth it. We totally would order again. We also ordered the Beef Bourgogne. It was not in the style we had in France, but it was equally as good in its own right. 

The Happy Hour is what I plan on pushing the office work crew to go to soon. $2 domestics and some $5 drinks. In addition there are some great Happy Hour snacks and French apps. Looking forward to the next visit. If you work downtown, you have no excuse not to try it. It's where Sonoma used to be on Penn.

I've been back multiple times with girlfriends. Love this place. Even my picky husband loves this place!
