4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I was attending a conference in Vegas and stopped in at this place because it was convenient. I got the lobster roll for lunch. The lobster wasn't overcooked and was tender against the roll. I wish the roll was a bit for toasted but the food was good. The complimentary bread though was the best! A perfect french baguette that was crispy on the outside and soft in the middle. 

The service was great and always asked if we needed anything. 

Overall good experience.
