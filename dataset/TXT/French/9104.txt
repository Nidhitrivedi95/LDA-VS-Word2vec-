The bread is fresh and perfect.  Really, I think that's the best bread I've had in years.  We started with delicious Duck Confit.  We've been in love with Duck Confit ever since visiting the real city of Paris a few years back and this one certainly did not disappoint.  I had the chicken palliard and my hubby had the Chicken Grandmere.  Both were fantastic.  
To top it off the service was excellent.  We will definitely be back.  

Plan ahead and make reservations early!
