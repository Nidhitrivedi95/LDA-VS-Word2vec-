O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q We were  there Saturday night, Feb 12.  We had a 5:30 reservation to celebrate my son's 21st birthday.  Big deal right?  Well, we were still sitting there at 7:30 waiting for our food and it wasn't like we ordered a lot of appetizers or salads to start.  Tables that came in after us were done before us and granted we had a party of 10, but if you can't handle that large of a table, don't offer them!

Our server was also possibly new, but was enthusiastic and was trying his best. We were confused when asking for recommendations and had 2 different servers give completely different reviews of what is on the menu.  We also  noticed a lot of staff just standing around, so it appears that maybe part of the problem is management.

The "family size" sides are very small, certainly not large enough for more than 3-4 people to share. The food was just okay so for the amount of money we were spending we've definitely had better!  We had reservations to see a show at 8:30 thinking we would have plenty of time so we ended up eating as fast as possible and running out to get a cab.  No special desert or mention of my son's birthday and no offer to comp anything on the bill.

Big disappointment-wouldn't eat there again and would never recommend it!
