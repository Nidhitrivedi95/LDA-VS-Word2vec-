hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA I really can't express how awesome this little cafe is any more than what everyone else has gushed about it. It's definitely in an awkward location, right off the 215 between buffalo and durango, but don't let that stop you from trying it. Everything is made in-house, with love, and tastes every bit worth that effort. 

The must-haves are the pain au chocolat, the apple tart, any of the sandwiches, and definitely the coffee if you're a coffee lover. The owner, a very friendly frenchman named Olivier, actually runs the front of house as well as the counter so I swear you can almost feel like an intimate little cafe in Paris, if you block out the view of banks out the storefront. 

I can't wait to come back, as I didn't get to try the soup, but I plan on doing so in the future. The only thing I don't like is that they aren't open on the weekends--which is understandable seeing as they're in a corporate building center, but this place would make a beautiful weekend breakfast/brunch venture where I could take my time and just enjoy everything.
