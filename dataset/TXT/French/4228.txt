The duck confit is absolutely amazing.
Beets salad is delicious. 
Shrimp Risotto is creamy and perfectly seasoned. 
Loved the little pickle. 
I would of been a 5 stars - I took 1 out due to dessert was just so so.  
Perhaps I will try other dessert selection next time. 
Overall.  I am in love with this place.
