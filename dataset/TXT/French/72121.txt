XKPosZx2j4RHcZ8Ewdwj0A My very first review, and I'm more than happy to give this one a 5 star rating, as it is well deserved!

The food here is incredible, my favorites are the Ragoût d'escargot and the infamous Tartare de Saumon...My god, this is the best Tartare I've ever tasted.  It's so amazing, that I crave it on a regular basis.

If you go before 10:00 pm it can be on the pricey side, but it's worth every penny and more.  Go after 10:00pm and you get the $22 menu which is more reasonable.

The little outdoor patio is a nice touch for the summer too.
