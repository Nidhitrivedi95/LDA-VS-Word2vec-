That's not exactly a bad thing. On the contrary, the experience was exactly as I expected. However, the food lacked a something, je ne sais quoi, as the french would put it. 

I was there as a party of six, and we went with the menu prestige. There was plenty of truffles, caviar, and fois but nothing is standing out as I'm writing this. I'm having a hard time singling out a memorable bite while having no trouble recalling the same from similar restaurants of the same caliber. 

Actually, I do remember the dessert cart as crazy stupid. It was filled with an assortment of goodies from macarrons to rice pudding in shot glasses. But by that point of the meal, none of us was able to stomach much more. 

There's also something about dropping $400 per person in these times that just feels a little wrong. I can justify it if I was at Guy Savoy in Paris, but Vegas? I don't know, left an artificial taste in my mouth.
