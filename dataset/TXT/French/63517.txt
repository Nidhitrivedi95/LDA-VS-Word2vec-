t1mR_Zff6Dqv1TueE2JLEA 5/5 stars for the experience! I went here with my family for dinner on a Wag Jag (or something similar to it) and I was delighted by the experience. At first I was a little apprehensive to try the food because it wasn't pasta (LOL), but it was really delicious! I loved everything I tried, it was all so different and interesting. If I saw this deal again, I would definitely go back.
The cushiony couches were neat, the draped room felt so special, and our waitress was excellent. 
I liked watching the belly dancer dance and drunk patrons dance with her. I enjoyed watching our boiling hot tea be poured into our little tea cups from our waiter's outstretched arm. I had a great night with my family here and I would definitely recommend it!
