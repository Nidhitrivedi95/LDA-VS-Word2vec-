It's brand spanking new replacing Thai Paradise, and while Thai Paradise didn't seem to utilize their patio well, Elle M'a Dit's patio quickly rises to one of my favourite patio's on Baldwin. It's small but has a great mix of tables in the shade as well as in the sun (this is at dinner time I'm talking about). You can also bump free WiFi from TAN which sits next door if you're on the patio :)

The menu changes daily and from lunch to dinner, which is a great treat and they do a lot of prep work on their meat in house. I didn't pull out all the guns in my visit in terms of ordering some of their pricier items, I did have their gazpacho with shrimp ceviche which was just what I needed on a warm summers day. It was also pretty chunky so you chunky haters best stay away. But for $8 I did find the price a little steeper than it should have been, but I still highly recommend it. My main dish was their Tarte flambée (a flatbread dish) with gracious amounts of brie, bacon and oil and finished off with a delicious black tea crème brûlée which I thought was a little small on the portion front but then again, better to have just the right amount of dessert than stuffing yourself. The rest of the menu looked very interesting, pricy but I have a feeling it might be worth it to treat yourself. 

The waitress was very friendly and professional and overall I don't have a lot of negatives to say about this place. 

But French food is high quality food in small portions, sort of pretty much sums up my experience here.
