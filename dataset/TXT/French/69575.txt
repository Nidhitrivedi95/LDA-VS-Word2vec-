WOd8tWsh2Yt_osHv-ngx_w The Universel omelette had so much in it (both meat and vegetables) you could barely see the eggs! I'm so glad I asked to hold the potatoes and toast and substitute fruit; the omelette in itself was a full and satisfying meal. Definitely not pretty, but pretty tasty...I went late morning on a weekday so I can't comment on how busy it can be, but I sat at the bar and had my food in less than ten minutes. An excellent meal for someone who only really eats two meals a day.
