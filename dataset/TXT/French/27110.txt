dd3GZs6zW2t7BM0cbxAzvg walking by this restaurant, always curious, my friend and I decided to go have a glass wine. we started to drink two glasses wine then ordered escargot, and foie gras. escargot was good, different way cooked. however foie gras was cold inside, made us  have no more than bit. Wine lists had good choices.
