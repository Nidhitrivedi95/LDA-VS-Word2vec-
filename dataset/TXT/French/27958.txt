The setting is everything you'd expect of a lakeside establishment, cozy and comfortable with ample outdoor seating to take advantage of the water view when weather permits. The menu is essentially French. I can't say whether or not Bernard, the cute little man in the kitchen, is French as well, but I imagined him speaking with a French accent. I think that adds to your dining experience. Bernard is a likable character as he broods over your dishes. 

We came in for brunch, and I personally ordered the Quiche Lorraine. My two dining partners both went with the open faced sandwiches (recommended by Roger), one tuna, one chicken. All of our entrees came with a fresh petite salad, bonus! I love my greens. The quiche had a great flavor. Its texture wasn't quite as silky as my ideal quiche, but I gobbled it up just the same. The open faced sandwiches were impressive, a very generous serving. Our jaws dropped when they came to the table. They looked beautiful! Even though I didn't have one, I would recommend them for sure if you are eating meat. 

Overall, I probably wouldn't hike down to the Lake for this experience alone, but if you are planning a day by the Lake with ice skating, shopping and perhaps an overnight stay, this is a perfect spot to nosh on brunch.
