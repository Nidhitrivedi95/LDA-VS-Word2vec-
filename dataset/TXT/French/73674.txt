xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g I really enjoy reading peoples complaints about excellent restaurants. Most of them are unfounded rants without any knowledge of the art of cuisine. I often wonder if they ever even been to the restaurant. as for me I have been to the Eiffel Tower Restaurant on a few occasions with my significant other. Each occasion costing upwards 400$ and worth every penny. 

Aside from the romantic setting and views of this restaurant you have perhaps some of the best service every experienced in a restaurant setting. Yes, of course it's pricy but you get what you pay for. From the minute you enter you are catered to, from jacket hanging to chair setting you are the boss at this restaurant. The treatment continues throughout the evening such that if you are on a date or with the one you love you are fully credited for the great experience. 

Now, for the food, each course is an experience. From salads that leave you begging for more to prime cuts of steak that melt in your mouth. Desserts are the cu de gra.  For a wonderful and satisfying experience try this restaurant you won't be disappointed. 

Suggestions: make reservations in advance, request a window table center and bring a date you are planning a serious relationship with (this is not a McDonalds date environment).
