wuuJhxMDAj5gGVdvobGHJg A chef friend had recommended this restaurant to my brother so we gave it a shot.  I am so glad we did!  

The wait staff was attentive and made suggestions for wine pairings with our courses.  I had the Snow Crab Risotto and the Beef Tartare and they were fantastic.  I don't know if I am sophisticated enough to remark on the wine pairings but they complemented the meal well.  For desert I had the creme brûlée.

Outstanding! We will be back!
