qmh6zxtJ8C8-YiUPv7ySlw DBB has been my go-to restaurant in Vegas for solo dining at odd hours. I've always shown up without a reservation. It's always packed when I go, and yet they've always managed to devise some way of accommodating me. 

The service and the food are consistently top-notch. The pace of service is good, the seafood and meat fresh. I usually go for their specials or something non-traditional and I've always been impressed. 

The service, however, is inconsistent. The rating I conferred them does not reflect this, as my own experiences have been consistently wonderful, but I've noticed other diners receiving varying levels of treatment. For example, I received amuse-bouche when other tables did not, and other waiters made obvious efforts to upsell when mine did not. 

I will continue to frequent DBB. It remains one of the most satisfying and down-to-earth fine dining experiences in Vegas.
