UPb91KcX0lhYKDVTvo-DRw We went with a bunch of friends.

Overall I liked it and worth a try.

Had the ducky dumpling as an appetizer : amazing!!
The beef for dinner was too raw, thing is they did not ask for a cooking preference.. So it ranger from medium rare to medium. Too bad i don't like blood in my plate, but my friend switched her plate with mine and it was great then! It was very tasty.

Desert was ok.
Food price for three meal course and byow (40$) though they did the billing wrong and we had to point it out.
