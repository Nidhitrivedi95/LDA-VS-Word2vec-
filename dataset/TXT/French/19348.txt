aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw After two weeks of slacking off because school has just started..and especially after a weekend of partying in Vegas, I was sitting in bed suffering the consequences, listening to my monotoned, not so funny but tries to be professor lecturing through podcast.  The only thing that saved me from pulling my hair out was the delight of munching on my pastries I brought home from Bouchon Bakery!!!

I had the Financier and Pain Au Raisin for a total of $5.25.  Trust me, this is a very fair price to pay for heaven in your mouth!  First, I devoured the Financier, which is like a Madeleine but better!  It's encrusted with sugared, sliced almonds, which gives it the perfect crunch while the cake itself was perfect in every way: both in texture and taste!  I wikipedia-ed financiers and supposedly, "financier" is "derived from the traditional rectangular mold, resembling a bar of gold".  And boy, this truly is a bar of gold.

At this point, I was going to give Bouchon Bakery 4 stars.  Then........then I finished my Pain Au Raisin for breakfast.  Can my taste buds be any more spoiled?!?  I thought being a day old would depress the quality of this croissant-like pastry but noooo.  The raisins aren't pruny; you can actually taste the meat of the raisin..and the sugar crystals instantly dissolve in your mouth!  

I admit, I was skeptical at first..but now, I'm a believer!  I can't believe I didn't try Bouchon Bakery the last time I stayed at the Venetian, considering it's the first thing you see once you leave the Venetian Guest Towers!  I'm definitely coming back to try everything else they have to offer!
