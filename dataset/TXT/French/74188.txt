xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g This place is pretty amazing.  I have had my last two birthday dinners here.  I got the tasting menu both times and was very pleased.  The food is super high quality.  All the two top tables are facing the windows overlooking the strip and balcony.  They have a great selection of breads, although the lunch time cheese filled rolls are amazing.  It is pretty pricey but worth it for special evenings out.
