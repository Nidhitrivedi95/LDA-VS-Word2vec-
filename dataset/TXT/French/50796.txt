oZHbPhIj01_31jqD053a_Q Best meal ever. Period
Got the tasting menu. Subtle tastes using all parts of the palate  Starts with the butter for the bread (was given 4 different ones) and ends with the deserts. Presentations are interesting but conservative and do not overwhelm the food itself. In the case of the smoked rib, it augments it (see photo-thats a glass serving dish with smoke in it, when the waiter takes off the top, you get a wiff of smoke, which starts gets everything going. Service was outstanding also. You will not be disappointed. Make reservations in advance.
