xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g I lived in Las Vegas for 20 years. Rarely are in the strip. But this month we stayed at the Paris and absolutely loved the ambiance and flavor of this amazing dining experience. I had the Escargot and frais Grai (so) amazing food beautifully prepared. The fresh butter on the bread was phenomenal. Dan had the veal medalions which were cooked perfectly. We ordered the passion fruit soufflé. Unbelievably delicious. 

Cocktails were also delicious. I had the Autumn in Pais a spectacular peat martini. Dan loved the Long Island iced tea. 

Our server Wes was friendly and attentive to a perfect balance. 


We'll probably go back for a special occasion. It's amazing.
