0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g After eating at Picasso, I highly recommend eating here! It has such an exquisite location behind the Bellagio fountains. Depending on your seating area, you are able to watch the show as you dine. 

When deciding my meal, I went for the prix fixe which consists of three courses of your selection. During our meal we were given about 2-3 courses that were compliments of the chef. Every single dish that was served was amazing. In my opinion, Picasso is Michelin starred for a reason. My favorite part was the dessert, I ordered the Banana French Toast with Ice Cream which was absolutely marvelous. If this is an option for dessert, get it! 

The staff was what you would expect from a restaurant that is ranked so highly. They always kept your glass of water full, pushed in your chair, folded your napkin, and was very polite. The waiter we had was very attentive, helped us make decisions with the menu, and explained items we did not recognize.

At the end of the meal, they give you a box with "Picasso" written in red letters. Inside the box contains delicious baked goods. 

Tip: Make sure you dress nicely. There is a dress code.
