t1mR_Zff6Dqv1TueE2JLEA We went here for a quiet evening and it was terrific so a group of us went here for a birthday celebration. They have a fixed price menu with several courses. You can look on their website in advance to see what you would like. I particularly enjoyed the traditional Moroccan Harira soup and the "cigars". It was all very enjoyable. The atmosphere with the tenting inside the restaurant is beautiful. We also went to see the belly dancing. That was a fun part and some of us got up to get a "mini lesson". It was fun and silly. A great pick me up experience with beautiful surroundings. The service was very good and they checked with us to see that everything was going well.
