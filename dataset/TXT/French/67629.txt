UxWH8zRYIBgs6Q2oykvRdw The food was good but the restaurant misses some final touches to make it great. The atmosphere is gorgeous, beautiful renaissance style decorations mixed with a modern touch. The service is where they need a little help. 

We arrived a little earlier than the rest of the group and sat at the front bar for a drink. Although there were numerous servers, we sat for 15 minutes without anyone asking us for a drink. 

Once seated at the table with the whole group it took some time for the rest to get drink. We ordered oysters to start and the waitress brought us a different amount than we had asked for. No biggy, but when one of the guests ate a bad oyster nothing was done  on her part. 

The main courses were good. I had the veal tomahawk meatballs which was one giant meatball with tomatoe sauce. As far as meatballs go it was good, but nothing will blow you away. It also comes with gnochi which is quite bland, simply creamy. The onion soup I had a bite of was very good; thickly caramilized onions. 

Overall the experience was good, but I won't be writing home about it.
