The majority of the items were sandwiches and burgers but they also have little breakfast quiche that looked delicious.  I was able to try a sample of the brisket which I am always a fan of but this was slightly different than what I am used to. I enjoy a Texas style brisket with lots of smoke and a flavorful rub.  This had none of that but was still tender and tasty.  I decided to have the burger and o-rings which was alright.  

What were more exciting to look at were the desserts and the gelato.  The Red Velvet pastry looked amazing among all of the other delicious choices.  It looks as if the pastries are very well done.  I was able to sample some of the 12 flavors of gellato that they make in house and out of the three I tried the bananas foster was my favorite, excellent flavors.  

I cannot wait to go back here for some gelato and some espresso  while sitting on their outdoor patio area.  Welcome to the neighborhood.
