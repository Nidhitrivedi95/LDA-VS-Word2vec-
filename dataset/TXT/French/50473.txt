oXSnH3yxo4qMPHtLjEdwFw Great little spot near the Lachine canal. It is a BYOB and if I am not mistaken there is a SAQ not that far away. Food is simply amazing. Fresh, simple dishes are very well prepared and served fairly quickly.

The wait staff is super friendly and you can feel the vibe that they do enjoy working there and with each other.

The place at night is quite packed and can get very loud so am not sure if it is the perfect romantic spot for dinner. I would say it is much better if you are a large group.
