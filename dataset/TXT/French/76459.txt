Yp9w4nhUowBU_IS_StFXbQ It was my mom's birthday celebration trip, so I decided to take her to Tableau at Wynn for a nicer breakfast. The staff is very attentive and the decor is beautiful. Having said that, while their food was tasty, it is definitely not worth the price! They offer a good variety of natural juices, so my mom and I tried the Orange Zest and Red Deliciousness - both of which were very tasty. We also ordered Nautica Benedict, Smoked Salmon and Brown Butter Apple Pancakes. Everything was yummy except for the pancakes - they weren't bad, but they were a little bit more on the dry side. Our total was about $100 - if that's not crazy, then there must be something wrong with me. I understand it's Vegas and like I said, the food was indeed good but it's way overpriced!

Gave 3 stars for the value!
