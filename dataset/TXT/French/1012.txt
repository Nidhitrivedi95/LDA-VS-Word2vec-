_cjPEH9wXhKS-HQe_U3M4Q The most delicious beef on the planet. I am actually salivating writing this.

I had the french onion soup and the boeuf bourguignon...eating the pieces of beef was like eating beef flavoured butter...it was so soft. I would go back there in a heartbeat. The service was great as well.

Very few restaurants this delish and with that true bistro style in Toronto.
