d482l58ho0_IMdFkXX1F5Q My friend and I searched for places to eat prior to coming to Vegas. We are big foodies and always want to know the hottest restaurants and the local favorites. I knew as soon as I saw Daniel Boulud had a place in Vegas that we would go. The atmosphere was sophisticated and the service was impeccable. This was by far the best meal my friend and I had on the entire trip! We started with the chicken flatbread and it was amazing. The gruyere bread rolls were delicious and similar to a popover. We each had a soup as our next course. I had the French onion and my friend had the butternut squash soup both of which were fabulous. My friend had the prawn linguine and I had an 8oz filet cooked perfectly medium rare with brussel sprouts. It was the best steak I have ever had in my life and just melted in my mouth. We each picked a dessert with mine being the grand marnier soufflé and my friend picking the salted caramel chocolate torte. They were the perfect cap on an incredible meal!
