rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw Located in Aria and it took over American Fish.
I loved the entryway and the tile circular flooring.
Inside the bar is very grand and beautiful flowers greet you. Very much like a brasserie in Paris.
We ordered the frisée salad which was good but the egg was not poached but pretty much boiled which defeats the purpose of the egg in the salad.
I ordered the heritage chicken that came with mushroom bread pudding and green beans. It tasted great except only the meat close to the bone was a little pink so I avoided eating that part. 
Also got the steak frites which was good.
The best dish was the macaroni gratinee. Never had it served this way but it was the best.
At the end they gave me some pretty flowers :)
Must go back to try the amazing looking desserts!
