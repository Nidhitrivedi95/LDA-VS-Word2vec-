4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw This place was amazing.  The service was impeccable.  The food was delicious.   and the whole experience was unforgettable. 

i ordered the prime burger with brie cheese.  and my gf ordered the half mussel plate.  both of which were very tasty.  

They also give you free bread to munch on and this weird picked carrot spread to use with the bread.  

The servers were very nice and tended to our every need.

The view was majestic.  Make sure you get outdoor seating if you can beat the heat.  How can you beat a view of the ballagio water fountains combined with the view of the bustling street view of Vegas?  

5/5.  Recommended.
