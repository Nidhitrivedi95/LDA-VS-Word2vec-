rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A gotta be honest I was staying at the Aria and went all the way to the Venetian to have my birthday breakfast here as Food is good but service is terrible in my previous experiences with this restaurant. Myself and my two kids arrived to an empty restaurant and a snobby hostess who provided a menu as I requested and told me "you can leave and take the menu with you" like WHAT?!?!? I told her I was planing on eating here and wanted to make sure the Benedict I like was still on since we were approaching brunch/lunch. She literally stuck her nose up and turned away. I could not believe it! I felt like I was smacked in the face by segregation... I mean where am I?! i was not prepared for this type of " service" I returned the menu and went to Hash House A Go Go where my family and I happily were treated like people to huge delish portions ( see my review and pics)
