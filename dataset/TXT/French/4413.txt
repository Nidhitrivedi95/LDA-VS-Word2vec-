Was expecting to get a late brunch with my friend but learned that it was only available until noon. 

We took the croque monsieur and quiche du jour; the only 2 items on the menu that seemed more adequate for brunch.

Wasn't expecting much from the quiche but oh god was it good! !! The egg was creamy and chess. ..packed with flavor.  Definitely the best quiche I've ever eaten. Also tried my friend's crowd monsieur and it was also excellent.

Definitely will be back to try other things on the menu.
