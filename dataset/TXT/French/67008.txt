USleI8g1UVN9-9jm-b4uIg As a native Charlottean, I have no idea how I've never been to The Fig Tree. Now that I'm an "Elizabethan" I made it a priority to visit. I am impressed. 
The house is so interesting. I love the bar. The service was first class. The environment is intimate if you want it to be.  All the food was as described on the menu, good quality-lots of flavor. 
I will absolutely return to The Fig Tree.
