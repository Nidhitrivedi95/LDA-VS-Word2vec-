4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Rosie is the best waitress by far. We arrived later in the evening and had a small wait for a table but she was attentive and friendly. I was intrigued by the special of the day - a fish of some sort. Later, I realized that the fish specials cater to a, more, ah, mature crowd, and I should have gone with something a bit more daring. 

Based on my reaction to the plate when it arrived, she reminded me that if I didn't want it she would gladly replace it. Since she offered, I took her up on that and ordered something off the appetizer menu (lamb?) that was devine. 

Thank you to Rosie for taking control and making these guests VERY VERY pleased and VERY VERY likely to return.
