xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g The Eiffel Tower Restaurant was very good.  The view of the Bellagio and the fountains is really great.  The service was quick.  I had the French Onion Soup to start and didn't expect it to be creamy, so I was a little skeptical at first, but it ended up being very yummy.  All the flavors were perfect.  For dinner, I had the Filet Mignon and it was good, but it was undercooked.  I asked for medium and it was more medium-rare.  The meat was tender though.  For dessert, I had creme brulee.  It was quite good and a big portion.  Mine was perfectly cooked, but others at my table said their's was a little soupy.  All in all, I would recommend coming here.  The food was delicious and the view was excellent.
