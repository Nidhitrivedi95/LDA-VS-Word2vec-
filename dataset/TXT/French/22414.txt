BSmqxPbQglQwP2R56OqOag All day happy hour Monday in the bar area was legit. Tried several different drinks. All of them were delicious. They use luxardo cherries, not cheap maraschinos. Only had  appetizers... drunk bread with added prosciutto was rich and cheesy but yummy. Eggplant was awesome, perfectly cooked, and shrimp was very flavorful. Cheap and scrumptious dinner. Regular menu looked pretty pricy but some of the dishes might be worth the splurge. Will definitely be back. Great place.
