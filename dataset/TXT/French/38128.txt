JezHN-9KKLTMbojq00VP0g I've been wanting to try this restaurant for years and finally went for lunch. The service was ok, fairly attentive and it wasn't too busy. Unfortunately the food lacked taste. I had the onion soup and mushroom & chicken crepe, and both were very bland. I'm not opposed to another visit to try a sweet crepe but this is not the place for savory French food.
