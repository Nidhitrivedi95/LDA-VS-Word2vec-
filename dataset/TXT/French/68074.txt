vg55SAkrEmuHpWfIMtJjBQ Possibly the worse service I have ever had.  We had a party of six and so they applied a mandatory 18 percent tip.  We only saw our waitress twice when she took our order and when she brought our bill. Food was brought out by a runner.  We had to beg other waiters for refills etc.  yet our waitress received 18 percent.   Honestly no incentive to provide good service and she clearly was not interested.  On top of this the food is just ok. Not great. Not bad.  Just average. Add horrible service and mandatory tip I suggest eating elsewhere.   Too many other good choices that I understand service and the customer are important.
