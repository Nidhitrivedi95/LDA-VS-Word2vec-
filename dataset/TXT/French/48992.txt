OkC86YtZ0Nm19my5F4GGrQ I stopped here for dinner before an event. Brie appetizer was delicious, the tartines are huge-beef brisket one was amazing. Mushroom pizza was really good with plenty to take home. French onion soup was a little salty but that was my only complaint. Kind of a romantic place but I'll Likely be back...the area of rocky river it's in is adorable.
