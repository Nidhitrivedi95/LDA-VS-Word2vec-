LHwzyN5cllTfLuZ8v2k_Bg This restaurant is recommended, so there we go.  I ordered the Pave de Boeuf au Poivre, as told by the waiter that it is not the most tender one but very tasteful with strong seasoning. I myself find it a bit oily. The fries come with plate are one of the best. The dessert is good. 

Service is very friendly. Although we booked at a much later time, due to schedule changes we are accommodated to an earlier seating.  If during a warm day, the patio is excellent as it sits on a quiet street with lots of greens around.
