La Petit Cafe on the outside looks like an unaware sandwich shop right off the highway, but walking in it becomes a quaint, French, lunch destination spot.  Although the location is spotty with cars whizzing by and office buildings surrounding, the Cafe and Bakery holds its own.  The inside has about 10 tables a couch area for lounging.  There are also about 5 smaller tables outdoors when the weather is nice.  Once you order, the server will bring the food out to you, but you more or less will clean up your self.  When I went, it seemed a little understaffed, so it was it took a little longer than I had hoped for my meal to come out - about 25 minutes.

The menu has a nice selection of your French lunch classics like crepes, baguette sandwiches, croque madames, and quiche.  They also some great coffee and complimentary water as needed.  I tried a very good ham and cheese sandwich with an added egg.  The meal came with a very small salad, though more tasty and better looking than your typical house salad, with beets and a side of fresh fruit.  The baguette was fantastic and the added egg made for a more formidable dish.  

La Petit is a very nice lunch destination in the area.  My meal came to a little less than $10 for the sandwich meal, but with my work nearby, and an outdoor area suitable for a dog or just to enjoy the weather. I will be back.
