SJo_IjvzdRtCvZVN0cbrRQ Food was absolutely terrific. I had the Garden Salad and the Bacon & Egg Croissant, which were delicious!! The service was par and our server was kind of rude when we asked nicely why our Hot Chocolates hadn't came out yet; he responded: "You never ordered any." But, other than that rude comment, everything was great!
