XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q One of the best meals of my life and I've eaten at some of the world's greatest restaurants, including Guy Savoy in Paris, French Laundry, Gary Danko etc...  We were picked up in their gold limo at our hotel and whisked to their private entrance at The Mansion.  Wow, talk about lifestyles of the rich and famous - the Mansion is MGM's super exclusive and secretive high roller hotel, not open to the public and with only 22 suites.  It literally feels like you're in a different world, like a Four Seasons on steroids.  

We were seated in the adjunct room at  Robuchon which I didn't mind a bit, unlike other reviewers.  I felt that it was super private, the room smelled like wonderful flowers and the service was ever attentive.  We opted to go with the 16-course tasting menu with high-end wine pairing.  I opted for the vegetarian option.  The sommalier was super friendly and asked us what we liked first, whereupon he went off and opened wines just for our dinner.  The vegetarian menu was wonderful, often restaurants treat these as an afterthought, but someone had definitely paid attention to what they were doing.  The server told us they only get 2-3 such requests a month, so for them to always have this on hand is impressive.

Service was impeccable, each dish was like a work of art.  The wines were simply amazing and creative, especially the Chave Hermitage Blanc '04.

This dinner will stay with us for a long time...
