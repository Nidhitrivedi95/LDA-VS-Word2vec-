I couldn't wait to get back to the city to then line up for brunch (seriously get it together Toronto), and so proceeded to yelp my way into finding a decent brunch spot on the way back that wasn't your run of the mill eggs benny and pancake.

In comes huevos gourmet. A small place located at Lakeshore and Islington (what google calls the "New Toronto" area), it is a Mexican breakfast joint. It definitely has your eggs benny and omelettes but with the seasonings and flavour of Mexico. I got the huevos rancheros, which is without a doubt one of my favourite breakfast offerings. 

This one wasn't bad - needed heat to it (but I guess this way it is more palatable for everyone), and there is hot sauce on the table for you to spice it up. It needed a bit more acid and cilantro but overall it was good and I would come back for it. It comes with a side of potatoes or salad (or get both like I did and enjoy!) and the huevos rancheros are served with buttery, crispy baguettes which is perfect for mopping up the yolks. Oh and the guacamole is fantastically good! Authentic and fresh.  

The tables are very, very tiny which makes it awkward to eat at times. The service was fantastic and I loved the artwork and pictures on the wall.

Would definitely come back to try some other things on the menu to get a true rating of the place.
