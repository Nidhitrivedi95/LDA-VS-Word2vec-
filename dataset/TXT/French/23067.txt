bzbNGyrTwWHAgg1CqkSgeg Came here for the first time on a Wednesday evening at 6:30.  Me and my friend were a bit surprised to find that when we arrived we were the only people in the restaurant but this resulted in extra attention from our server.
We started with the fried green tomatoes which were pretty good but not amazing. Then for our entrees I got the chicken and waffles and my friend got the shrimp and grits.  I've had some good chicken and waffles and although these did not quite reach the spectacular level it was still delicious enough that I would go back to get it again!
