bzbNGyrTwWHAgg1CqkSgeg Wow!  What a wonderful find!!  I visited the Terrance Cafe for brunch one Saturday and it was wonderful.  My boyfriend had a Bloody Mary, it was garnished with a piece of bacon (he loved it) and my mimosa was fantastic.  The blueberry fritters that they were handing out were to die for and my sensible egg white omelet was to die for.
