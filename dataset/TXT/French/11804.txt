4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Came here for a bachelorette brunch. We made a reservation for 14 guests, and had to sign a contract. We arrived 15 minutes before our reservation, and checked in at the front desk. The woman who seems to be the manager had attitude for no apparent reason. That is why I am giving this place 4 stars instead of 5. We were seated promptly. On Saturdays, they have a brunch menu. I ordered the crab cake benedict (it was the dish of the day). SO GOOD. The egg was runny, and I didn't feel too heavy either unlike almost every other benedict I order. I also ordered a side of breakfast potatoes, but those are actually hash browns. I thought they were going to be little cubes of potatoes :(. Oh well. All in all, the meal was great. They also have DELICIOUS bloody maries. I hate V8, but this tasted delicious! Kind of like a lucas (mexican candy) flavor, but not really... you have to try it :).
