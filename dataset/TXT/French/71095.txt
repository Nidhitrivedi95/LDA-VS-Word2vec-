xcmmTXhuMx2fZF2Bt69F4w WOW! Really glad that Yelp! steered me here on my short trip to Pittsburgh.

I'm not one to frequently order mussels, but WOW, these were freaking amazing!  I ordered the small bowl of mussels in the curry sauce, which was strongly recommended by the bartender--who was also fantastic.  I seriously wish that I could have bought a gallon of the curry sauce to bring back to my hotel room and bathe in.  It was incredible.  I was even forced to ask for some extra bread (which was also great) to sop up all of that delicious mussel infused curry sauce.  

I thought I'd start with the mussels because I think that's what they're known for, but I also ordered the crab cakes, which were equally, if not more, incredible.  If I had a degree in food journalism I might describe them as sumptuous, flaky, and moist, which I'm sure they were, but all I know is that they were some of the BEST crab cakes I've had in a long time.  They were also paired with a really nice roasted red pepper salad.

To top it all off, I thought the atmosphere here was great.  As I mentioned earlier, the bartender was friendly, informative, and was serving up some delicious belgian beers.  This place would be great for a date, but I was quite comfortable sitting at the bar alone. 

To all you PIttsburgher's who insist upon eating a giant sandwich topped with fries (my hotel was actually serving a salad topped with fries?!?), try Point Brugge--the food is incredible and the people are great!
