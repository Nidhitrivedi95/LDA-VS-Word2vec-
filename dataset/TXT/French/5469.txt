3jKUbhGSjFTv5jZ0wnW0xA The French food here is amazing!  As a person from DC, we don't really get a good quality French cuisine, but dang, this went above and beyond my expectations!  My family and I got the lamb, salmon, duck confit, bass, steak tartar, foie gras, and the charcuterie and fromages.  The flavors were great and the meats were tender.  I would recommend this place to everybody, especially out-of-towners.
