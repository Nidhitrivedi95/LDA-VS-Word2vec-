0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g Came here with a bachelor party and this place was amazing.  Menu probably changes everyday or week (I included a picture of the menu I received on the Yelp page).  One word to describe this place is execution.  Everything that went into my mouth was thoroughly flavorful.  Presentation was great and venue was very nice (especially if you sit outside).  If you are looking for a place to eat for a special occasion, this is the place.  I'm really curious to try out this chef's other Las Vegas restaurant now.
