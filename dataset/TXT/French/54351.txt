rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw My review is a tad but late but it does not change how much I loved the interior and the food of course! 

I came in about two weeks ago with my better half for brunch. We had been viewing they're menu for some time now and finally decided to pull the trigger! 
Haha 

We showed up and fell in love with the bar they have at the entrance. 

Our server was a French girl I believe sorry if I'm wrong but she was amazing!! 

We ordered the foie gras parfait with toast the port jelly on there was nice tart and sweet for the richness of the foie..

The lobster scramble with caviar was frikkin awesome! Perfect amount of caviar it will not be over whelming I will definitely order this again. 

Of course being a Sunday we both ordered bottomless Rose that they offer and our server made sure to keep it flowing!!! 

Thank you Bardot!
