QeFsIMcIFIJcOrpthYL8jg Our guide recommend this for a dinner when in Montreal.  Traditional French cuisine.

The ambiance was nice, and included a live jazz band.  

I ordered the steak frites; actually what it says steak and fries.  Standard meal. Nothing to brag about. 

Maybe other meals are better.  Definitely a great place to sit down, order drinks and listen to good music.

And of course the crowd and staff are all a class act!
I salute you Montreal!
