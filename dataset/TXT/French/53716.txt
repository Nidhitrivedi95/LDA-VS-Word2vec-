French food is already very complex in flavor and it was near impossible trying to decipher it against the sustained buzz of that many patrons.  If you do end up deciding to squeeze your way onto the dinner list, request a table by the windows for a full view of the creepy Wynn watershows on the quarter hour.

| Scallops |
The little condiments and the sauce have a nice strong tone against the softness of the seared scallops.  Request your waiter to make SURE these are slightly underdone so that they're just right by the time they get to the table.  Boulud service can be a little spotty so I take it upon myself to see to the proper precautions.

| Escargot & Egg Flan |
I'd get this dish simply for the delish sage gnocchis, but the delicate flavor of escargot was lost in the overpowering combination of potato, onion, and flan in a fully buttered sauce.

| Daniel's Kobe/Foie/Truffle Burger |
Honestly, a burger is a burger.  I couldn't taste the foie nor the truffle against such a hearty hunk of beef.  And a burger with a sad tomato and a wilted lettuce will garner as much respect at a fine restaurant as it does in a burger bar.  The fries on the side are good though!

| Brussel Sprouts |
A mix of pan roasted brussel sprouts and chestnuts stewing in a nice pool of butter.  It's very rich and savory, but I like mine done in a lighter fashion.  You've GOT to love butter if you come dine at this place.

Pricey for the quality of experience:
Dinner for 2 w/wine = $260
