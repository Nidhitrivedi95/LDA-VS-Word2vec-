hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA i really like the prosciutto here. its probably the only thing i get there every time i go now. the prosciutto has excellent balance of flavors from the nuts in the bread, to the cheese, light dijon, and of course the meat. tried the moroccan chicken and the curry chicken. i couldnt really tell the difference. although i did try them on separate occasions. both tasted good. their ginger drink is really good, a little pricey though. oliver is always friendly and puts everyone in a good mood. i think the ladies just go there to hear is french accent. maybe i should have used a french accent at my restaurant...

although if i see a line i usually leave.
