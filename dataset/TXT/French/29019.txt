EPb3FWs3mxQLUjGeMNP0SQ I like suite 701 because of the rooftop bar, it's perfect for drinks during the summer while enjoying the view. I love their cocktails especially their raspberry mojito and cucumber bash. The dip trilogy with pita chips is the perfect snack to nibble on while you drink.

I'm not impressed by their food, I'd come back when it's nice and warm to sip on some cocktails on the rooftop and for snacks, but I'd go somewhere else for dinner.
