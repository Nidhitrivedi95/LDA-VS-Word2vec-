rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I have never been here for dinner, but I like brunch here a lot.  My favorite thing to order is the Corned Beef Hash.  The corned beef is fried with a slight crisp, and the runny egg yolk on top adds a little creaminess to the dish.  I can eat this for breakfast, lunch, brunch, or dinner.  Everyday.

Another popular item is the Bouchon French Toast, but I thought it was too sweet. It tasted kind of like an apple bread pudding -- a great apple bread pudding, but not a great French Toast.

1 star off: The beignets were disappointing.  They were cold and hard, like their butter.
