DOmVF9YKOvTkqjcgUwtOgQ Delicious food in a pleasant brasserie setting.

We had great, friendly service. The recommended french onion soup was the best I have tasted- lots of cheese, great broth. The mushroom-stuffed chicken rolls were superb, accompanied by delicately seasoned vegetables. The creme brûlée was as also excellent, as was the special brownie. Portions were small and prices moderately high, but the Table d'Hote meal package was only $31 Canadian dollars. Worth a visit.
