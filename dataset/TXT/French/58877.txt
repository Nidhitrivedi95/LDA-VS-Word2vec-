rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w My friends and I dine out quite often but le cirque was a special experience due to one unique component.
When you to Le Cirque the food is good the service is great but their is one component  that brings the experience to a whole different dining level...

The sommelier, Fredrick did the most amazing wine service we have ever experienced.
Go for the food stay for the wine! 

He is a master storyteller, showman and and overall master of ceremony. He brought our dining experience to such a level that the dinner truly became an experience for us.

Skip circus de soleil "O" in Bellagio and go to Le Cirque instead, because they put on a show that just as good, but tastier.
