Tefx_N6A6nrsdj4jHHnbYg I have been searching Las Vegas for a good bakery for a very long time... Le Petit is the best I've found! It's maybe a $10 Uber Ride from the Strip. I haven't had Crepe's this good since I was in Paris.The Breakfast Classic Sandwhich was absolutely mouth watering! The Jumbo Cookie melts in your mouth. I could go on and on forever! 
The service exceeded my expectations. I felt as though I was visiting family. Very warm and welcoming! I would highly recommend this business to all my friends and family.
