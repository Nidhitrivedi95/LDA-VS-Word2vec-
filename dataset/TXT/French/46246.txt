MZ4EEf4VtkeSJURIGgp2AQ They change their menu every week. The service was good initially. We got there at 605pm and the food came at 707pm . We waited literally an hour for the food but when I talked the the manager his first reaction was not to apologize but to tell us we only waited 35 mins because they had a timer in the kitchen. I mean we knew how long we waited...  anyways Later he came and apologized and gave us a free meringue cake. 

The food was average to be honest. The shrimp salad was very mediocre. I can make better shrimps than they do.
