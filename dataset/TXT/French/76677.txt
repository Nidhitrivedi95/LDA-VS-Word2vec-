I got the salmon smoked Benedict and it was divine. The sauce, the salmon...the fact that they take off the center of the bread and fill it in with cream cheese...mouth watering and just perfect.

The banana bread french toast was really sweet and it's more like a banana bread with syrup then traditional french toast.

As a tip, get the round medallion hash as a side dish. You won't regret it. The salmon Benedict came with 1 but that wasn't nearly enough. 

The ambiance is wonderful as a major plus. 

I will be back, a top spot for me in vegas for sure. 

A solid 5-stars.
