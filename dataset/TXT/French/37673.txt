jalA5zHW8ZfY3RSPG7oDxQ This place is great! I went here for a nice dinner with my girlfriend. Never having been I didn't know exactly what to expect, but the whole experience could not have been much better. They are cash only and BYOB which they kindly remind you of when you make the reservation. 
On that note, you will definitely want a reservation, especially in the winter. The whole place can seat about 2 dozen people, and it has a small open kitchen not much bigger than a home kitchen, but with much better food! Every dish was a revelation and the service was great and friendly. A small compliment how great the food was also earned us a bonus dish courtesy of the chef :) . I nearly never write reviews, but this is my new favorite place in Pittsburgh, I can't wait to go back!
