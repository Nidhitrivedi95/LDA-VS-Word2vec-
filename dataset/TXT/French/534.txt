-RLvb1XUiRkfYciBeqVm7w My husband and I visited O'Chalet on a Friday night, our last night in Montreal. Most of the city was still digging out from the record-breaking snow storm the day before so we were the only guests in the restaurant for most of the night. Neither my husband nor I speak very much French, however our waiter patiently translated their menu for us (which was entirely in French). We had very tasty seared scallops for an appetizer while we waited for our meals. My husband had fish with asparagus and the tastiest beet quinoa I've every tried for an entree. I had a beautiful flank steak with gorgonzola polenta and broccolini (our waiter suggested the perfect glass of red wine to go with my meal, as well). For dessert, my husband had a very light and tasty creme brûlée an dI had their warm brownie with raspberry sorbet and chocolate sauce. It was the perfect meal for a cold quiet night in Montreal and we will definitely go back here next time we return!
