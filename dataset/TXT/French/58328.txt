rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I find it interesting as one looks over the photos of (French toast). Brioche Doree as posted here by guests.  The half brick sized piece of thick custard served to my uncle and I adjacent I might add to the table of Chef and proprietor Keller bore no resemblance to pictures on yelp of the same dish.  The bacon, sausages and my Aunts waffle along with delicious coffee sufficed.
