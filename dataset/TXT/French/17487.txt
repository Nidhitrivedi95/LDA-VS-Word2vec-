9mG2yOnHtxVPEM1p8FqycA As a tourist from NY, never have I been to a crueler place on earth! This spot introduced me to the Madame Croque dish, and ever since, I have been ordering the very same dish in every brunch restaurant in NYC and not once have I tasted something nearly as amazing! Yet I keep stupidly ordering it over and over in hopes of finding its NY equivalent, but alas, none. This is definitely one of the most amazing brunches I've had in my life. Go! 

And please convince them to open a branch in NYC!
