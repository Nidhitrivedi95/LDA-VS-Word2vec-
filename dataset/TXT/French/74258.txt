xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g The only French thing here is the snippy service. Great food, view and ambiance, but menu could use a nice reboot / refresh - a few healthy options and truly French or lighter Mediterranean options would be great. We had 2 waiters who both were a bit rude and not super helpful. 

After staying at the hotel for a few days, this was the only place the service was so-so. Both the front desk, other spots inside and Mon Ami Gabi were all very helpful and friendly!
