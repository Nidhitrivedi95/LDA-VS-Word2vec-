0JGMKaKJGVuDus5WcJzvjw Just came back from dinner. Ordered the house salad to start. Was delicious. My eagle eyed wife spotted a fruit fly dead on a carrot. Fruit flies were buzzing around. Understand they're hard to control. 

Wife ordered the lobster spaghetti. She started eating it for twenty seconds and spotted a short black hair on the spilt lobster tail. Told the waitress and she removed it stating she will make another one. 

I completed my fish. Was very good. Except my wife watched me eat. I knew what was next. About 10 minutes later they brought her new lobster pasta. Now I had to watch her eat.  She felt bad but she loved it. 

Nobody including the server apologized for the hair. Normally a manager is notified and stood by the table to apologize. Waited forever for the check. Our waitress was handling a large table and never checked in on us. I asked another sever for our check. Finally our waitress brought it. 

Not the way we expected our dinner to go. 
One star for service, the fruit fly and hair. 
Still tipped 20% as always. Not sure why but the servers always expect it for whatever type of service they give. 

Thanks for reading.
