Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA I have been there twice.  I wanted to research having a cocktail wedding party, outside.  The first time we went there was on a Monday early, at 6 pm.  We did this on purpose so that we could enjoy the view and talk to someone about having a party with table service, passed apps etc.

The patio was rented by some corporate party, so that was closed.  No one would talk to us and the bartender would not even make eye contact. 

I guess we were not hot enough.  


The second time was perfect.  We went in on Friday early 7pm. it was not that busy and we got a table outside.  
The waitress was so nice and helpful and told us were to go to get some good seafood. 
LOVED HER, LOVE THE VIEW.  That was nice of her to take the time 

Yeah the drinks are expensive, you people forget you are in VEGAS.  

The other couple we were with kinda freaked out. 
"Where in the world did you get the idea that Vegas is cheap." 
They thought we were gonna spend the weekend at the all you can eat prime rib for 9.95$  
I don't think they have those anymore, right?  So we bought the round. 

Then we asked the cocktail waitress if we could come back after ten for the music and did we have to pay a cover.  She told us to talk to the hostess desk down in the lobby right in front of the elevators and ask them to stamp your hand so you can come back in for free.  

The guy looked at me all puzzled and said STAMP? HUH?  Then he hands me his business card and said I'm the manager just come on up front and see me later.  LOVE them

The timing can be hit or miss.  The view alone is worth three stars.
