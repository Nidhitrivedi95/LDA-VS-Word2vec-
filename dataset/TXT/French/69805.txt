WOd8tWsh2Yt_osHv-ngx_w Pretty decent brunch place near where we were staying. The portions are HUGE for the price and the decor of the restaurant is very welcoming. We ordered two dishes of the Salmon Lox, one dish of the blueberry crepes, a banana/nutella crepe, eggs, strawberry mimosas, coffee and orange juice. 

Everything was very delicious however I noticed that they didn't give us a bread basket compared to the other tables. The service could have been better though so I would have to deduct a star for those two negatives. 

Probably wouldn't come here again but it was a good brunch place nonetheless!
