4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Mon Gabi is my wife and I's favorite restaurant in Vegas, it's that simple. We go every time and enjoy both brunch and dinner there. 
The hash browns there are heavenly but they have seemed to change over the years and not in a good way. Hopefully they fix this. 
The blue cheese olive Martini is also heavenly. Not a typical offering, which is refreshing. We enjoy everything here, it's really hard to make a better point for me. I encourage it, give them a shot.
