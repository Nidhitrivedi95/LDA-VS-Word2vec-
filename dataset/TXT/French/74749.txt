xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g This was my first time to Vegas "doing it right." On a whim, I decided to get a table at the Eiffel Tower Restaurant as it did have a great view of the Fountains. We were a bit early about 6 or 6:30, so the restaurant was not filled yet. We entered from the elevator right into the kitchen viewing area. Not sure of the reason for this, but it's nice that you can view the kitchen at work if you want to. But I don't think entering the restaurant to this area is the best idea. Anyway, we rounded the corner to a beautiful restaurant and bar area. The hostess greeted us and we were seated in just a few minutes. I think this was so we could take the place in for a moment (which we did.) We were seated near the far corner, about center of the Bellagio. I was excited as this was my GF's first trip to Vegas and this was the place to see the fountains. Unfortunately they didn't start until 7, but that was ok, because we got to meet our waitress, Alix. She was one of the most pleasant and professional wait staff I've ever encountered. She was on it from the moment she arrived. The Champagne was wonderful, as were the Filet and the Salmon. Finally during the meal, the fountains started. It was a great vantage spot and the GF loved it! Dessert was a small cake and ice cream. A great restaurant is measured by many things and The Eiffel Tower hit them all for me.
