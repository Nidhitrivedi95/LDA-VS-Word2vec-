4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw One of my favorite places to dine on the Strip! Breakfast they have delicious crepes and you can get a latte in a massive mug for that perfect caffeine boost to start the day. At night, sit outside and you get a great view of the Bellagio water show. They have a wide menu to cater to most tastes, the staff is always pretty friendly and accommodating although because they are always so packed, sometimes they forget your table or they bring the wrong food. Last time I had breakfast there the busser was in such a rush he tried to serve my meal to another table and then to me and I had to send him back with it, as of course, you don't want food that's already been served to strangers. Overall though it's a must try on the Strip!
