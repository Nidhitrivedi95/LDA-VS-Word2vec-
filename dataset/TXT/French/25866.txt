Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA MIX is a restaurant that I had to try since it is part of the Alain Ducasse group and the restaurant serves some of Alain Ducasse's signature dishes from his Paris and Monte Carlo restaurant. Better to pay in $ than in Euro. The restaurant itself is gorgeous, so fitting for special occasion or to impress your date. The restaurant is at teh 64th floor of the THE hotel next to Mandalay Bay. They share a parking garage, but different lobby. The restaurant has 360 glass window so you should be able to enjoy Vegas night view wherever you sit. The interior is all white with this blown glass cubes coming down from the ceiling.
The food is pretty good. I ordered one of the signature appetizer: the japanese sea bream sashimi with popcorn. The sashimi is seasoned well, better than what i had at Le Bernardin in New York. For my entre, I ordered teh $75 fillet mignon topped with foei gras and black truffle. I did get generous portion of foei gras and black truffle shavings. The black truffle is great but the foei gras was too big, too rich. It was a good dish, but you get what you paid for. I wish i had ordered Alain Ducase's specialty, the lobster curry thing. 
My partner ordered chicken/lobster surf and turf, and his dish was excellent. Crispy skin on the chicken but still moist.
In the French Super Chef battle, I think Joel Robuchon wins out by a mile. Still need to try Guy Savoy at the Caesar Palace and Twist by Pierre Gagnaire at the new Mandarin Oriental. Pierre Gagnaire's restaurant in Paris is usually in the top 10 restaurants in the world.
