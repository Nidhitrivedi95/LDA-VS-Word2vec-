kIW8IeTV3W1tS_q_WAU4wQ We came here after a dinner at a restaurant not too far from it. We wanted just some good drinks. At Le Local, we had to order 'food' with our alcohol, but dessert counted as food. So that worked! The dessert portion was tiny, so it's not for sharing.

We wanted more of a dessert cocktail, which we didn't see on the menu. Their drinks menu looked good, btw, but we just wanted something sweet. The waiter recommended the chocolate pear martini, which apparently used to be on the menu, but for some reason it was taken out. I think they should put it back on the menu cuz the chocolate pear martini was delicious :-) 

The ambiance was lively and trendy! The place has a nice decor and fun vibe - quite enticing. The service was all right, but our drinks were delicious! I'd definitely come back to eat here.
