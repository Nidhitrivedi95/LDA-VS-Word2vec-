OYHpqY6-3C-wXR-uPbHhwA Friendly, fast service, clean storefront and kitchen (I like that you can see into the kitchen!!), and a welcoming environment.  They had a great breakfast selection, but a chocolate cupcake caught my eye!! So rich and amazing and... their chef was amazed that I asked what kind of buttercream he used! It's not the shortening crap you get from some places!! Oh no!!! They make true Italian buttercream, and oh the difference!!! The flavor and mouth feel were perfect, the cake was still moist even though I feel the cupcake was made the day before.  The flavor was on point and not overwhelming or too sweet, and it was decorated beautifully! I will definitely return to sample more of their goods!!! I recommend this place to everyone! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I reserve that for near perfection.  I am not taking anything at all away from this gem of a cafe- it just isn't a Michelin starred place :)  Go visit them!!!
