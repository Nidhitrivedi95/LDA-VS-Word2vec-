bEVWHtBRYVwqaaNF4mWNYg Gorgeous French interior, elegant and cozy, excellent wine, genuine friendly service (and they brought us the bill only when we asked for it), and the food was delicious.  Great menu, great atmosphere, I wish more restaurants would take example to this little place.  Their small cafe L'Express café is  also very quaint.  Marble table tops and Parisian chairs, good coffee and croissants. Very charming.  Highly recommended.
