K64Uw3a2Enh2MznpwRHWKQ I was disappointed. The ratings and reviews on Yelp raised my expectations for this place. If you're a local I can see the appeal. Great wait staff, personalized service, and the chef even mingled with the crowd. BUT if you're in town on business save yourself a trip. This place is just OK. I had the short ribs, which by the way some on Yelp raved about. Where I come from they'd call it pot roast. The calamari and shrimp appetizers were just average.
