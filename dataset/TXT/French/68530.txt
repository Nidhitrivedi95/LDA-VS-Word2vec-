vLkKorA1gPS97Zj0_WKA0Q Was very excited to try Twist but overall was disappointing. The service, staff, and wine list were all excellent and very pretty location. Food however, other than a couple of notable dishes, was mediocre for this type of fine dining. Amuse bouches were interesting and breads very good. Highlights were the Loup de Mer and Foie Gras appetizers and the Dorade with risotto entree. The rabbit, pork, and lobster entrees were very underwhelming and plating is strange as all dishes come out in multiple separate plates/bowls rather than one composed dish. Desserts again come in multiple separate components and highlight was chocolate soufflé but none were stellar. Overall, for these prices and with reputation of executive chef and hotel, the food was a let down.
