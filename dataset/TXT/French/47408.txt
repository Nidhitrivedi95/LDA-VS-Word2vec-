We were guest at the palazzo hotel and decided to grab a bite to eat on our way back to our hotel room. The server had an attitude as if he didn't like his job. 
Server Mike(Dark hair Caucasian male) said 'fucking people' then denied saying that. He said he didn't say 'fucking'.He stated they it was referring to another party early from today. 

Robert (Tall asian gentlemen) the manager, came to the table and did not want to comp the whole meal. He asked if there was something he could do and I said to comp the whole meal but he said no.  
He offered to comp us a drink or a dessert but I decline. We are not heavy drinkers and do not do a lot of sweets. I just asked for another server. Team co worker and team customer. Spoiled my whole meal and appetite.
Oh and food was horrible. Ordered the farm raised chicken, seared scallops and potato leek soup(which was ok).  Only 3 parties at 11:30pm at night. Eventhough we came late, they should of still had their establishment together. 
Robert needs to work on better customer solution with conflicts. He didn't know how to make things better. It appeared that he was on employees side (team employee) but he shouldn't make it that obvious. Customers come first


The staff do not have it together here. The ambiance looks great but some of the workers create an ugly atmosphere. Plenty of places to eat in Vegas besides this establishment.
