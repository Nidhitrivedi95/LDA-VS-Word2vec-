OYHpqY6-3C-wXR-uPbHhwA Great little cafe! Me and my husband were pleasantly surprised to see a place like this in North Las Vegas. There's outdoor seating with umbrellas and indoor seating if you need to get out of the sun.
I had the breakfast sandwich which was delicious. My husband had the steak and eggs which he said was "ok". We also had the tiramisu which I thought was amazing!! It even came in a little edible chocolate cup.
We will definitely be back if not for breakfast at least for another pastry.
