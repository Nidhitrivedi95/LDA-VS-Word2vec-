4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Really liked this place. Although it is a corporate chain, it did not feel that way at all. The service was top-knotch, the food looked and tasted great, and the bread was warm!  Add to that, the view of the Strip, and you have a great dinner before or after Jersey Boys! Well done, management!!
