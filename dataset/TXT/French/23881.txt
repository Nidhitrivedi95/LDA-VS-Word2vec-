cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg Excellent food and excellent service! Pretty much our main inspiration when planning a trip to Montreal (along with those Fremont bagels! lol).

I would recommend ordering (ahead) the pigs head! It is seriously the most delicious thing ever! Yeah people will gawk, I dunno why, but they do- let them! Its so flavorful, the skin is very crispy, the meat tender and full of flavor, and if your an adventurous eater- everything is good! The tongue, the brain, (the eyes if you wanna get all Bizarre Foods Ala Andrew Zimmern- we did, lol) everything on it is absolutely delicious! Should be good for 2 people, or 3 if you don't eat much.

Have also had the stuffed pied de cochon w/ foie gras and foie gras hamburger.  Both are very good and flavorful! 

Fyi, I cannot understand the reviews that complain about the food being heavy...where did you think you were eating?? lol. The food is heavy, it is rich, it is delicious! If thats what your going for- come here. The vegans expecting a light dinner, um don't? lol.

Also, the service is super great. I remember a couple visits ago I dropped my butter knife, I saw a waiter approach me so I turned my head, in a matter of seconds of dropping that thing, one waiter replaced my knife and another picked the one I dropped off the floor!! I was like :O :O :O what is this crazy attentive service I am experiencing?? So awesome! All the peeps that have served us there have been very friendly, on top of service, given full descriptions of what we're interested in ordering, just fantastic!

Also, really love the vibe, its loud and fun, love the open kitchen, gives you something to look at. Last time we were there Emeril popped in for dinner and I just thought "Yup, this place is the shizz!"

Great restaurant, always leave feeling super full and satisfied! :)
