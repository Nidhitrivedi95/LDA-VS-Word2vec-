4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Food -  We ordered Onion Soup, Frisee & Warm Bacon Salad and Beef Bordelaise. 
Onion Soup - was OK but a bit on the salty side. Generous portion and definitely was not stingy on the onions. The beef stock was salty and does not have that rich buttery aroma to it.

Frisee & Warm Bacon Salad - It was light and refreshing. It was simple yet delicious. The soft-poached egg mixed nicely with the citrus vinaigrette. The portion is on the small side.

Beef Bordelaise - Steak was nicely prepared - medium rare as we have asked for. The potato chips on the side was impressive but a bit too salty to eat alone. 

Ambience - Will definitely ask for an outdoor seat next time. The lights for the indoor seating was poor and not suitable for taking "foodie" pictures :P
