UpEVdq_euH-5mqCIgUAd2Q Amazing service and atmosphere. Definitely an ambiance conducive to an anniversary (as on our occasion). The food was good. My scallop appetizer was cooked to perfection and my favorite dish of the meal. The lamb was also good but did not quite have a wow factor to elevate it to great. I suggest the martinis and a patio table if in the area.
