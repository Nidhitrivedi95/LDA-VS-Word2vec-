cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg Much like prom night as a teen boy, Au pied is one of those things you fantasize about long before you ever experience it. Also much like prom night, it ends up being a bit of a let down. Not because you built it up so much in your head that it couldn't possibly measure up, but because no matter how good an effort is made, it'll still end up awkward.

I wanted to love Au pied, I really did. The space was very cool, the setting intimate and service exemplary. The food, however, felt like it was trying hard... too hard... to be different. I can appreciate a chef taking chances, or making their own way, but dinner here was more like being a guinea pig in a mad scientist's experiment than it was being along for a culinary journey with a genius. Black bean sauce on a seafood platter? Ehh, not feeling it.

Make no mistake, everything was good. They are doing some interesting things with quality ingredients and for the most part, they're successful. What they aren't doing is blowing me away with every course... or even really convincing me that I have to go back. In a city that kicks most other cities' asses in the food department, there are better options.

As a side note, we did get to see what I'm convinced is the largest lobster to ever be captured. It was ordered by a table next to us, had to be carried by two men on a large wooden platter and was clearly inspiration for a few sci-fi flicks. Think I'm full of ish? Check the pic below. See? Massive! (That's what she said.)
