gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA My guest and I had a wonderful time at Alizé.  Atop of the Palms Casino, you'll find yourself with wonderful views, excellent service, and good french cuisine.  I've dined at a number of locations in Vegas that have great views, but the view at Alizé heralds as my favorite.

To start dinner, you are presented an iPad with a myriad of beverage choices.  Then you are presented with a number of bread options and an amuse bouché to wet your palate.  To start, I ordered the steak tartare for an appetizer.  I recommend that with no hesitation.  My entree was the Sea Bass which was good, although it came with a few different plated vegetables that were only ok.  When they present the dish to you, they pour a light sauce over the top which I could have done without.  There wasn't much depth or flavor to the sauce and I'm sure it could have reduced the calories in the dish.  Overall, the Sea Bass was still very flaky, had a nice crust, and overall... was still very good.  Our dessert was the warm peach gallete which was served with a marzipan ice cream.  This too was delicious.

Overall it was a great dining experience that I highly recommend whether you are a local or just visiting.
