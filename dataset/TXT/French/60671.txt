SCklYa_jhihWAcfIn-_chg Their croissants are so amazing. The wife and I always walk out with a bunch of them to take home after our meal. They always have specials on the chalkboard. First off, their fresh fruit juices are really good. We had the pear and ginger, which sounded odd at first, but when we actually drank it, it made me want to buy a juicer just to try and make it myself. I usually have the tuna salad on a milk bun, but I tried the pea meal sandwich. It was good but nothing out of the ordinary. If you ever get a chance to come across their tomato basil soup-GET IT. Get some to take home too. Trust me, you will not be disappointed.
