jA3xcba82t8x06H8NzG4VQ I used to enjoy the Black Pig when it was on 25th - it had a great happy hour and great drinks.  Generally I'd just order a burger or the bahn mi though.

I knew their moving to the old "Light Bistro" also was supposed to bring about a slightly higher end feel (though they still have burgers and bahn mis!).  I didn't know what that meant, but tried it and was incredibly impressed.

We ordered the chartcuterie tray, which is what the chef is known for.  He creates his own sausages, pates, etc., with defined flavors and they perfectly complimented the mustard, beet and pickle add-ons.  I especially loved the, I think it was Captain Morgan styled cutlet?  So good!

For dinner, I had the pork collar and my fiance got the filet.  Both were well presented and perfectly cooked.  Very flavorful and they both tied in with their sides.  

It was a great meal.  Their back room is perfect for events (that's where we sat and I was envisioning birthdayparties or rehersal dinners) and we will ABSOLUTELY be back.  Great move, Black Pig, great move!
