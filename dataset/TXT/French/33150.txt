HHvO4MgBFabsmlInou6viQ My friend and i came here for a wonderful french dinner last week, but i still remember everytjing perfectly. I had the duck, a very sizeable portion with a sublime wine sauce that complimented the duck perfectly and the roasted fingerling potatoes had a light, crisp skin perfect for absorbing the amazing sauce without becoming soggy. 
The wine and food are a very reasonable price for the quality and I would definitely go here over any of the fancy restaurants on king street any day! 
We were disappointed that they didn't serve mussels because apparently they are famous, but the server said it was usually on Tuesday and Thursday that they were available!
