SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ My family and I came here to celebrate my wedding. For as many years as I've lived in Tempe, I can't believe I've never been to House of Tricks. We started off with the mediterranean tapas. The hummus was delicious and the pita bread was so soft. My grandfather and I each ordered the turkey club. The pasta salad was so flavorful! My brother and mother in law ordered the pastrami sandwiches and they loved them. My mom ordered the french dip sandwich. And my husband got a noodle dish which was flavored amazingly well. He is gluten-free so he was excited to have something more than just a salad.
It was a delicious meal and I can't wait to return!
