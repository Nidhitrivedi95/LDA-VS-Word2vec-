S5gtq6g6dIfyaFvyPYyzkg First time in the Dome and will be paying another visit soon, cannot rate highly enough such an amazing place at Xmas. Decorations are superb they have spent a lot of time and effort to get it looking this good, it even smells like Xmas due the amount of cinnamon sticks intertwined within the decorations. Never had time to dine but sampled a few cocktails and they were top notch, bit pricey but worth every penny for the atmosphere alone.
