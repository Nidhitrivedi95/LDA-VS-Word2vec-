mnn--vaYHtNyBNYFYBFIog Oh, Toque! You tuk all my money, but that's OK.  We went in knowing we'd have to take out a loan to eat here - - and it was worth the quick jaunt to Montreal for it. We may be the poorer but our stomachs are the richer.
We opted not to do the tasting but went a la carte (French for 'arm and a leg'). I had a lamb tartare appetizer and the halibut main course. My gf had the fluke appetizer and the lobster appetizer. Hands down the halibut was but a dream. The fish was a light, pillowy bite. The mushrooms were shroomy and meaty. It was a perfect combination and probably one of the best dishes out. Everything else was great as well, and my gf enjoyed the red wine selection.
This place is on a lot of 'best' lists for Canada, and it is fancy. They give ladies a hook to hang your purse from the table so it DOES NOT touch the floor. Either that's super classy or they have mice. 
The one-star deduction is for the waiter. He was perfectly nice, but he kept forgetting what my order was and had to come back twice. Certainly not a big deal, but why can't these upscale places ever forget to charge for one of your orders?
