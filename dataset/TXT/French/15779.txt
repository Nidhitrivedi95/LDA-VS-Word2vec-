6GCbZASjMnAPYBWLc_z30g I don't normally eat at any type of chain but I was with people who really wanted to go here. It was overall underwhelming and would have been a one star had the manager not taken care of the issues. The food was so-so my burger was passable but not cooked the way I ordered. Our appetizers NEVER arrived while people around us who got there later and were being served by the same server got their food. We had to ask multiple times for soda. The last straw was my friend finding MULTIPLE hairs at the bottom of her meal. IT WAS GROSS. We finally asked for the manager and he did right by basically comping the entire check. 

Having worked in restaurants and the service for some time I asked him to share some feedback with his waitress. Yes there were screw-ups but they could have been mitigated easily with bread, and at least keeping waters and soda filled. No steps were taken to extend good service except for "I'm sorry". In the end the Manager did well but I won't be eating here again.
