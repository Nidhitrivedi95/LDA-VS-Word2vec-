gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA The WORST restaurant experience I have ever had.  One of the guests in our party got ill the next day from eating the steak entree.  We called management to complain and they failed to acknowledge that their meat was bad and did not make any concessions to amend the situation.   I would not expect this from a so-called Michelin star rated restaurant (according to the concierge).  Customer service is just as important as the quality of the food.  Alize failed to deliver on both.
