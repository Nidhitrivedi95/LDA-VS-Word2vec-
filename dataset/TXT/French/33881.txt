It is located in a very odd place but once you get over that fact, you actually notice how it's actually in a perfect place. It's isolated and very mellow.

I came on my lunch break after all the great reviews I saw, I just had to try it. The lady who took my order was very helpful. She even let me taste the soups of the day because I couldn't decide which one to order. I went with the half Mushroom soup and half Chicken Chipotle grilled sandwich. 

You can tell that the soup was just made and wasn't sitting around all morning. It wasn't too creamy and had good bold flavors. I am NOT a mushroom lover but this soup was really good. The sandwich was amazing. It is a pretty small half sandwich but it was a perfect size for me. But I think most of you should order a full sandwich. The bread was made from scratch. The ingredients tasted fresh. I also got a iced green tea which I really liked. 

The owner, Olivier, was great! I went to talk to him about getting a menu to take with me but unfortunately he doesn't have any yet. He did grab my e-mail and he sent me a copy of the menu. When costumers would walk in he would automatically address them by their name. Now that's good customer service and it shows that he has regulars that come in for his amazing food. He even let me know that he uses all organic foods and meats are processed clean with no hormones. He said he really cares about what goes into the food, which I really appreciate.

I will definitely be returning again.
