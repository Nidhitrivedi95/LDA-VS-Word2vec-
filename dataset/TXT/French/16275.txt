7tVxrQKhAfkGK55bU_ObsA Came here the other night to celebrate a family friend's retirement. Situated in the heart of the Junction, Avec Panache is a local establishment that's run by a husband-wife team. AP has been open for four years so it's a fairly new restaurant. I really loved the decor - including the exposed brick walls. This place can maybe have forty people so definitely inquire about a reservation. The menu is small, but it has something for every palette. With every dish, you can tell that there's care in the preparation (see my photos). I had the grilled halibut with lemon caper butter sauce, which was delicious! I can't wait to come back again to try other items on their menu, including dessert.

Good for: celebrations, parties, dinner
