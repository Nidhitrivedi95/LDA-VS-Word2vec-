yU3p0tEBtGuZLTcsBHw9uQ Brunch is my favorite meal.
Passe composé is in my top 5 brunch places!
This time, i tried the duck benedict, it was awesome. The blend of the bread snd the duck was just so perfect and the sauce was not heavy at all. I only had the one egg, because i was not that hungry. But after my first bite, I really regret not taking the two eggs...
