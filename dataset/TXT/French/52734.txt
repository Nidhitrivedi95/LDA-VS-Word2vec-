qbC4cfz-ShxEGpLS94Mk7Q There are those restaurants out there that when the evening is young and hungry, with friends, pop up immediately around the circle as we decide where to take our stomachs. Tati is not one of them. It's bistro charm and cute signage does not for me reflect in its food or its service. Even with three different visits, and a desperate (even pleading) mindset to like it. 

My first visit was a few years ago when I had just moved into the area. Since then service, as always, did not change. Slow, indifferent and almost unnervingly so. Simple water & wine top ups is not practiced here and neither are smiles unfortunately. Looking for your waiter will take some effort. 

On a second visit service had not changed, and the food had suddenly become simple facsimiles of the real thing, put together with no care and no idea for balance. The bouillabaisse packed with so much fennel and Pernod it tasted of a bad a Halloween candy. The bavette amazingly overcooked beyond our request for having it medium drenched in sauce. The fish and our blood sausage was good, were the only highlights and so were our escargot to begin. Which everyone agreed was the favorite.

I returned once more. This time to experience their prix-fixe. I sat down joining a friend and waited. Even with a friend who was already eating, and being served across from me it appeared no one noticed me. I got up and got my own menu. 

I just don't get it. It's bistro fare in a casual setting yet indifference marks it in every way.
