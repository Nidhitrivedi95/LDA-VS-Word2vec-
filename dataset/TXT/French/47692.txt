O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q It just occurred to me I have never written a review on Morels despite the fact that I go here every time in Vegas and it continues to get better and better each time. The service is also always superb!

After a show we popped in here for a late dinner - we went for the small Seafood tower and it was done if the freshest most delicious seafood I have had anywhere period !' It certainly is on par with Bouchon and Delmonico's with perhaps a better selection of oysters and the shrimp / scallops were out of this world. Cooked to perfection.

The cheese board has introduced us to some of our favorite cheeses ever and they have an extensive selection of wine, well priced for the Vegas strip location with experts that can guide you in the right selection.

And if you cannot make it for dinner, their brunch selection is also rather excellent with a fantastic Bloody Mary bar on weekends! Cannot wait to return.
