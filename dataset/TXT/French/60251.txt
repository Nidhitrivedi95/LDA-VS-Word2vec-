SBnpT6JDbah-5l_52GM5sw Brunch is one of the worst I have ever had in my life.  I paid $8 for a salad that I ate in 3 bites.  I am serious, and I am not a fatty.  I also ordered a mimosa, which was overly pulpy and had a bad strawberry in it, and a super bland bloody mary after telling the waiter I like a spicy bloody.  Our service was horrible too.  It was impossible to ever get our disappearing waiter to serve us.  Disappointing considering I ate dinner here like 5 years ago and it was decent.  This place is an overpriced joke.
