cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg What can I say about this place other than it is probably one of the best restaurants to eat in Montreal.  You have to try it to even comprehend the types of food and flavours involved in the stuff they are making here.  On top of all this book in advance if you want to try it!  I had to book well in advance to even get a spot and the earliest spot I was able to get was a dinner at 10:30pm at night.  I guess everyone knows about how great this place is along with the tourists as well.

My gf and I ordered  Duck in a Can, Foie Gras Poutine and the massive sized, Au Pied de Cochon.  I must say I have never eaten that much foie gras in my life let along in one sitting!  The poutine a staple dish in Montreal dining, was creamy and different than anything I'm used to having.  The piece of foie gras they placed on it was gigantic as well, about 10x larger than any fine dining restaurant I've been to.  Duck in a can was amazing, the presentation was unique and the taste was something unexpected.  So many flavours and juicy tasting duck crammed into a tiny can was incredible.  And the masterpiece known as Au Pied de Cochon, was huge!  The pork was very tender and went really well with the massive foie gras they placed on top.  This was so large of a dish we couldn't finish it and ended up eating it for the next 3 days!  

Overall an amazing experience and I really loved the atmosphere.  Portions are ginormous here so keep that in mind when ordering.  The prices to me were justified based on the amount of food you get along with the ingredients used.  I literally had a couple of pounds worth of foie gras that night, so I was surprised the bill wasn't more.  I am definitely coming back here again if I can somehow get a reservation again!
