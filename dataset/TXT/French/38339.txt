JezHN-9KKLTMbojq00VP0g I have been here several times over the past few months and each time it seems to get better and better! 

Recently while back in Cleveland, a friend and I decided to grab an early dinner here before going out to see a movie. Now let me tell ya, I doubt you could find a better date place for these prices and this quality. The place itself bares an almost verbatim resemblance to its namesake. It is 'a small triangle' and has an undeniably Parisienne air to it. With its checkerboard floors and cozy quarters I almost felt like I was in France. A tip for the wise, park right across the street by the Carnegie West Library, it's free and quite close!

We started off with an order of Bruschetta. Now, this is no ordinary Bruschetta my friend, oh no. This is my FAVORITE bruschetta in all of Cleveland. Every time I come here I have to restrain myself from just ordering four servings of it and calling it a day. I ended up ordering the Provencal Croque Monsieur. It had spinach, tomato, Gruyere & Dijon and was the perfect fix for a cold (no- scratch that, freezing) Cleveland night. My friend ordered the Smoked trout salad which had wood smoked trout over warm lentils with this great lemon dressing. Confession - I ate almost half of his entree, oops! To finish up we shared the warm plum croissant which comes with a vanilla bean ice cream. Perhaps 'shared' is too broad a word... it was more like, 'I ate a good 3/4's of it and he had a few bites', once again, oops! 

The only gripe I have with this place is the amount of time before you actually get your food. The server was lovely (there is only one, like I said it is tiny) and very informative on what to get but it was almost 40 min before our food came out and there was hardly anyone else there! 

To sum it up, perfect place for a relaxing and CHEAP bite with a date or a friend. If anything stop by for the atmosphere and a cup of french press, I guarantee, vous l'aimerez!
