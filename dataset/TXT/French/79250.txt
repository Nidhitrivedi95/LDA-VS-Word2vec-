ZdaZwXC0FByDY3EwNELphw I was wandering around Ossington when a huge rainstorm hit and was lucky enough to nab the last table at Union. The roast chicken was amazing, the steak tartare was perfect and the beer was cold. The waitress was really friendly and the atmosphere was phenomenal. Definitely a great spot to eat.
