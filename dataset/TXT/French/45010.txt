mT8Ej8sKFJoIa5G0Vl4AKA We loved the ribs so much, we went back 2 times during weekend.   Service is quick and we never waited for a table.   There was a $3 tap special during happy hour. $20 for the rib lunch special was very appropriate for the amount of food you get.   Lunch included soup and coffee/tea with meal. No lunch special on weekends.
