SFnrHuVFSNiondFVUBLJZQ The service was very nice. The food was delicious. The portions were large. The salad dressing was really good. There are three levels and it has a certain charm. The fondue for one it big enough for 3 people. Yum!  The Bloody Mary was really just vodka in tomato juice. That was the only thing we didn't love. Good coffee.
