HHvO4MgBFabsmlInou6viQ I was recommended this place from one of my line cooks that was here working on a visa from France. It was excellent and I'm glad he did. We went on a Sunday and we're able to enjoy a quiet dinner. The food was exceptional. The soup was amazing. I will definitely be returning. The service was also fantastic. I have recommended this place to my family.
