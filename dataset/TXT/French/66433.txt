uP3H5bcsiTXM0k0xQhRndg If your going to Montreal and love food, you must come here... not a big menu selection but high quality with their small menu selection with all farm fresh local ingredients.. my girlfriend had the pork belly which was so tender and juicy and full of flavor which was amazing by itself and the sauces only expanded the flavor and I had the mac n cheese with pulled pork and was creamy and cheesy with some sort of flavored sea salt for texture with a sweet pulled pork a great combo.. the waitress was very friendly and we talked about local things to do for about 10 minutes and then one of the owners came over to chat and even hand wrote us a list of about all the great things to do in Montreal.. my only 5 star review on Yelp.. well deserved
