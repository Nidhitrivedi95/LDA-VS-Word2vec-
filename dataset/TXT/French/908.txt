_cjPEH9wXhKS-HQe_U3M4Q Le Select is my go-to place for authentic French bistro fare in Toronto. The food here is great! Some of my favourites are the french onion soup (which is perfection), duck confit, and cassoulet. The restaurant has a very nice ambiance as well, with a distinct French vibe. Great place for a date, or dinner with friends/family. Plus they have parking!
