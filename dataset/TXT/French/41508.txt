kIW8IeTV3W1tS_q_WAU4wQ I recently had dinner at Le Local which turned out to be a disappointing experience due to the unprofessionalism of the hostess. Despite having made a dinner reservation for a table in a quiet spot over 1 1/2 weeks prior (and confirming this kind of table the day of), she attempted to seat us at a tiny 2-top in the middle of the dining room. When we asked to sit at one of the 4 empty 2-tops by the windows, the hostess told us those had all been "reserved for specific people". She then offered us a table in the crowded bar which had loud thumping techno music. When we objected to that, she said that was all she could do and with a swish of her long brown hair, teetered off in her stilettos.

Undaunted, we had a word with the Manager and lo and behold, we were offered one of the window tables we had originally asked for in the quieter dining room. I don't know why the hostess gal wanted to make life so difficult and put a damper on what would have otherwise been a nice meal. 

Apart from the hostess incident, the food was nicely prepared and of good quality. I really enjoyed my gazpacho with cucumber mousse, as well as the salmon tartare.  The decor was "industrial-chic"  and the atmosphere had a trendy vibe.  The location was in a downmarket part of town and a half block from a major highway.
