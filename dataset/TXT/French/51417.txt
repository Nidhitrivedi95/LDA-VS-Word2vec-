P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ This place is NOT traditional french. It is very haute cuisine, executed and delivered at a much higher level than your usual french fair.  It is an amazing room, with impeccable service and food that is simply undeniably the best in Vegas.  Very, very expensive.  Everything is executed in such a way that one leaves feeling like it was worth it.  Even the bread, cheese and dessert fit the expensive bill. Very worth it.  Guy Savoy sets a new standard in vegas
