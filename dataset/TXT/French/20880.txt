AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw Stayed at Caesar's and swung by here for a quick bite before catching a plane out of Vegas.  We each had a sandwich and it was indeed a little pricey for the food, but so is most of everything in Vegas.  The bread was a little dry for my taste, but the meat was decently prepared.  If I need a quick bite and I'm running through Caesar's, it's an okay option.  We didn't have time to try any of the desserts though (which seems to be what we should have chosen).  Perhaps if I stay at Caesar's again I will try it again...
