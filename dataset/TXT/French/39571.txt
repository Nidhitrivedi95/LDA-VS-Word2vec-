jwYnXuaSqtpiNwyU72Vm9Q The food was good but the poor service ruined the evening. We were a large group and it took 45 minutes to settle the bill since they grouped it all together. 30 minutes of that was past closing of the restaurant. Staff was barely apologetic and they did nothing to make us feel any better about the situation.  Since we were the only ones left in the restaurant, and commenting on the situation during our long wait, the staff was well aware of our frustration. NOTHING!!!
