4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw There's a nice evening breeze, you can hear Andrea Boccelli from across the street with a view of the Bellagio fountains, you look around and the Parisian bistro atmosphere is palpable. You're sitting on the Mon Ami Gabi patio, a Las Vegas staple.

I've been here so many times and at different times of day. For lunch, for dinner, and even a linner. It's the perfect place for a romantic dinner with your boyfriend, with your girlfriends or even your family. Most recently, I came here for a steak dinner and had the ribeye with mashed potatoes. I think that badboy was probably 22oz and I still wiped my plate CLEAN. It was cooked perfectly and the mashed potatoes are more on the creamy, runny side which I adore!

The service was impeccable. Our waiter happened to be French, which added to the French ambiance. Throw in a guy on a Vespa with a couple baguettes in his basket and you're in Paris, my friends!
