OkC86YtZ0Nm19my5F4GGrQ Love the atmosphere here. I have to admit, it can feel a little "yuppy" but I love hanging out at the bar and sitting at the patio. I have had appetizers and drinks here a few times now and absolutely love it. Would be perfect for a date night or girls night out! 
 
The basque shrimp and baked Brie is amazing! Actually, everything I've ever tried has been great :)
