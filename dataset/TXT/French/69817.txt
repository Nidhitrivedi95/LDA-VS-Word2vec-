WOj8nPos3R9IIf0Pyttd8g i liked lulu. bf took me here for valentine's day. it's a bit pricy but i love steak au poivre and we selected lulu just for that reason. the au poivre was pretty good, but bf's selection of brie stuffed chicken didn't live up to our expectations. it's been about 6 months since we went, so unfortunately i am lacking on more important details. i think we'll go back again though.
