yU3p0tEBtGuZLTcsBHw9uQ We waited an HOUR outside in the freezing rain for this meal...and it was WORTH EVERY SECOND!!! There were very few English speakers there, which made us convinced we stumbled upon a local joint--and the interior decor alone reaffirmed our belief that we were dining among the trendiest.

The lighting didn't make the photos look nearly as good as the DELICIOUS food. Every brunch plate comes with a cup of the most wild assortment of exotic fruits, and a shot of the smoothie of the day. So creative!

After really struggling with what to choose, I ended up picking the poached eggs with Duck Confit hash (they used butternut squash as the base which was interesting!!) but my boyfriend's French toast was undoubtedly the winner. His French toast was the most delicious French toast I've ever had in my life!! The server insisted he get that and I'm so glad she did.

His latte was delicious as well. Had I saved more room in my stomach/wallet I would have certainly tried a drink as well. 

Definitely try and go!
