The entire host and waitstaff are highly professional and look after the customers' individual wishes and concerns throughout the meal experience. Of course the most important part of going to any food establishment is the quality of the food itself, which I can confirm is excellent at Cafe Monte. I had a pizza that was just the right size and was topped with fresh ingredients. When I found out that the establishment also serves breakfast and brunch, I went there several times for that, too. I usually get the parisian omelette with brie, which is the perfect breakfast if you are really hungry! Since I have been to Paris several times and studied francophone culture, I appreciate as well the attention to detail with respect to the furniture and overall decor. I guess it feels like being in an authentic French brasserie but without the actual Parisian, unpleasant side order of waitstaff attitude!
