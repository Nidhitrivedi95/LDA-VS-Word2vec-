 If you have never been here before, put your shoes on, and rush on out and order Le Coq à la bière before the summer season (starting April 16) because you wouldn't need this much soul warming in the summer... It was fantastic!!! 

Imagine a cute little "Creuset-esque" pot served to you and inside the most moist, fall off the bone chicken and a bed of tasty egg noodles underneath, cushioning the juicy tenderness!

Rewind...I started off with the Goat Cheese, Nut and Honey salad, and after my first bite I really thought nothing could top that, it sounds pretty simple, but a hint of honey with goat cheese really works for me!! I sat there and said I could just have this salad and be happy... Im glad that I didn't stop there, because this was a meal that will make me remember that night for a while.

Dessert was a mi-cuit chocolate cake (similar to a lava cake, I suppose) and it was rich and decadent! However, I was a bit full at that point, and this cake should have been shared, I was full for a couple of days, not to mention satisfied!

Hats off to the chef & the owners.
