gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA My friends and I last evening had the tasting menu.  It was spectacular.  I have eaten at most of the celebrated Las Vegas restaurants e.g. Picasso, and found Alize to be better: Better service and superior food. The seared foie gras was cooked to perfection as was the duck, veal wellington and scallop.  The view, of course, was phenomenal.

Cheers to our fabulous French waiter with the Hermes bracelet!
