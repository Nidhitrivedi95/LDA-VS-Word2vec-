QeEQXdto_4wFRaNKyIygRA I have had the baked Chicken (Thursday special) and it is WONDERFUL!. A great change from all the chain and fast food restaurants downtown. It does get very crowded and little awkward when it is that way. 
The food comes fast and is delicious. I have only been here for weekday lunches, usually Thursday. My coworkers love the other specials too. 
If you are looking for a change from the everyday, this place is a great one to start!
