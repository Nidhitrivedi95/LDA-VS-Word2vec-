4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Late last night after a couple drinks, and winning a hundred bucks on the sex and the city slot machine (I guess people do actually win on that machine)....my boyfriend and 2 of our friends decided to eat here. Our friends work at Paris and are regulars of Mon Ami Gabi, but it was a first time experience for me and my boyfriend. 
To start out, the view is great! Even though I work at the Bellagio, I never really get to view the fountain show from across the street. Everyone made me choose the bottle of wine for the table for some strange reason, and although my wine knowledge is limited I went with a 2005 Bordeaux blend and everyone loved it. 
We started out with a couple appetizers to share and let me tell you how seriously delicious the escargot was! They were oven roasted in a garlic herb butter and just melt in your mouth. We also tried (much to my hesitation) the chicken liver mousse and I don't know much about pate or liver (except that mine is probably mad at me), but it had such an incredible flavor. They brought complimentary warm rosemary seasoned olives to the table, and if I weren't so excited about filet mignon, I would have been completely satisfied right then and there.
But, then came my perfectly cooked medium rare filet mignon drizzled with a merlot butter and I was the happiest girl in the world! 
I reluctantly shared half of my steak with my boyfriend, but we both decided that next time we will come hungrier and get out own cuts. Our server was great and so knowledgeable about every little detail.We finished the night with after-dinner drinks and good conversation. I slept so well last night :)
