m4PW-GMc8JOU5nmMYncu-Q I wish I could give this place more than 5 stars! The service there is above and beyond and the drinks are just as amazing as the staff. 

I came here twice on my birthday vacation to Montreal and each time it was fantastic. We got there at last call the first time and they were kind enough to still let us come in for a shot and beer. Tony even sang happy birthday to me. We finished our ABC flaming fire shot and said we would be back tomorrow.  

We returned the next evening before our dinner plans. We ended up staying much longer than expected. It was was so hard to leave Jessie and her amazing drinks and personality. She would ask our favorite spirits and make the most delicious and creative drinks I had seen (my bf and I are both bartenders too). Both Tonys were super nice and funny, and they kept us very entertained as well. Taller tony had even remembered my name and it was my birthday from the night before and proceeded to sing happy birthday again. It really made me smile and feel really special. 

I can't thank the staff and their excellent service enough. You guys made my birthday unbelievably special! I can't wait to come back again!!
