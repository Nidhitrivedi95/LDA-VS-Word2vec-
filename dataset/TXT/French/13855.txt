50-xiTYmE6NERi-yJ6NvHw I'll start with the good; our server was attentive, friendly and helpful.

The food was a bit of a letdown.  The fois gras was tasteless and far to airy.  The duck fettuccine tasted like chicken noodle soup without the broth...not what I expected at all.  

For dessert I had the Creme Brulee which was good but not the best I've had.  

This is not a place I would recommend nor would I consider going back to.
