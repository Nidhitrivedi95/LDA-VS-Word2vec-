9ot8oInkYZTt6wkkGe__vQ My boyfriend and I went there for our 1 year anniversary and I was completely blown away!!  I had never been to a restaurant as fancy, and as inviting as this one!!

When we arrived, someone took our jackets and walked us to our table.  The food was obviously amazing..but the service was even better!  There were waiters walking around with samples of food that they offered to everyone.  And this is the best part...our waiter asked us what our special occasion was and we told him that it was our anniversary.  He thought we were married!!!...and he came back with a little dessert plate with the words "Joyeux Anniversairee" written on the plate with chocolate!!  It was just so amazing that he thought of that!...but of course we had to tell him afterwards that we were not married..that it was a different kind of anniversary ahaha.  

I don't know when I'll be back, cause you know...it is quite $$$$$$$..but it was honestly worth the money!!
