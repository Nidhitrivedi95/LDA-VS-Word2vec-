rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w The ambiance is very nice. It is small and decorated perfectly to match the restuarant's theme.

The food is average. The risotto was too salty. The short ribs were cooked well with amazing flavor. Every other course seemed to be good with average ones and a few fails mixed in. 

It was nice of the staff to allow my partner and I to order different tasting menus since not all places allow that. The pre-theatre menu is a perfect portion size for a person who cannot usually finish american-sized portions. 

Based on the food alone, I would not come back.
