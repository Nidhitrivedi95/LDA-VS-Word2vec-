My friend got a small table near the window for this Parisian style restaurant. I was surprised that the kitchen is located on the basement, open concept for you to view all the cooks; everyone wore white. At one point, someone was yelling the orders like Gordon Ramsay from Hell's Kitchen. That was cool to see and hear. 

The washrooms are located together and one must share the sink with the other gender. Reminded me of my time in Paris, France. It was clean! 

Happy:  I got a three-course meal. I started with soup of the day which was a parsnip and potato purée and it came hot. It was the right texture. Creme brûlée was the choice for dessert and it was soft and sweet. I was too full to finish everything. 

Not happy:  For the entree, I had the duck confit with minimal veggies. The potatoes were interesting as it was finely sliced and stacked up like a lasagna. Cut into a triangle for uniqueness. The duck leg had enough meat for me but too bad it was salty. 

Verdict:  The waitress was very attentive and respectful. The meals came at a reasonable time. By the time we left, the place was packed, but we weren't rushed out. I would go back for another celebration to try their other dishes.
