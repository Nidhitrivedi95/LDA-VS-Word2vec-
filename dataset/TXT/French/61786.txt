sphMzEIqY1I2Dzv3zLZY2g Global is fine dining in a gorgeous, yet casual setting. My husband and I first tried Global during Charlotte Restaurant Week and have been back several times now. The food is outstanding! The menu is thoughtfully planned, and not overwhelming like so many other establishments. The cocktail list is a work of art! Everything we have tried has been mixed to perfection. 
The staff at Global is always delightful. It is apparent that management hires and trains with the highest expectations. 
On our last visit, owner/Chef Bernard visited our table to ensure we were pleased. He was so warm and genuine. 
We will be back again and again!
