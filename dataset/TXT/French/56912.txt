rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Perfection on a plate is defined my a flatiron cut, cooked medium rare, topped with slow-cooked onion marmalade, a round if herbed butter, and a pile of salty frites. 

Bouchon is my top five favorite restaurants in Vegas and by far the best resort restaurant. Service is impeccable and servers are super nice and not hoity-toity. Wine selections by the glass make excellent pairings. The oyster bar serves a range of briny to sweet from across the county. The desserts are a perfect finale with the crime brûlée being one of the best I've ever had (my apologies to my amazing mother-in-law, you have been de-throned).
