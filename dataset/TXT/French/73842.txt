xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g Second visit here; first was earlier this year.  Very disappointed this time.  Outstanding location, and view of fountains is of course a great plus.  Last time, it was special for view, ambiance, food, and service, but now I think we will not be back.  Almost all tables have a view; that is still nice.  I think this place has now taken on much more of a "tourist trap" feel.  Waiter was patronizing, overly pushy toward up-selling everything, and seemed to want us to hurry to turn over the table.  We wanted a single app (smoked salmon) for four of us, and he told us it would be small...we had had before, and knew it was enough.  He told us we had to order entire meal at once, rather than taking our time with drinks and appetizer.  He tried to steer each of us to a more expensive plate, insisted we must order sides, and even questioned our wine choices.  My wife's chicken dish was awful, all dry dark meat, poorly-seasoned, and poorly-presented.  Understanding this was not a "signature" dish, we still expected quality, but when we commented, the waiter wanted to argue the point; poor form.  Frankly, for the almost $400 we paid, this experience was dismal.  Go for a drink at bar, skip the dinner.
