4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Steak frites was amazing. Hint: since it is a thin steak ask for it one level lower than your normal preference. Husband had special which was beef wellington, great flavor but was a little underdone for my taste. I like med well  We sat on the patio which was great for people watching but rather noisy. I would prefer inside seating next time. Wait service is top notch, never needed to ask for anything as they were they anticipating your every need.
