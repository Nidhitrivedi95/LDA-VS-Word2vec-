4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Went with a large group for a bachelorette party but was seated right away and had good service throughout the night.  The bread and butter was delicious!  I love when the bread seems fresh and it comes in a loaf where you can rip it off and spread the home-made butter all over that.

The steak frites is what they're know for and the meat was VERY TENDER.  Delish.  However, mine was a bit salty.  The pomme frites that come with it are more like potato chips than fries.  Three of us shared the green beans and they were a welcome vegetable amongst the carbs and protein.  It was large enough to share comfortably.

Good ambiance.  Overall a nice place for dinner.
