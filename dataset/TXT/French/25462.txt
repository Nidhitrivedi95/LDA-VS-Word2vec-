We went to the bar/club at 11ish on a Thursday night. They let us in easily and with no cover. It was pretty dead in there, but that's nice in Vegas sometimes. 

The BEST view of the strip.

The BEST bartenders.

The BEST ambiance.

The BEST bathrooms. 

I actually exclaimed, "No!" when they announced last call at 2. (I didn't know they closed places in Vegas at 2.) But the bartender calmly transferred by Tom Collins into a plastic cup and gently motioned to the door. I could tell in his eyes he sympathized with me. What a kind, caring man.
