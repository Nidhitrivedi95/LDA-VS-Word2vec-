EPb3FWs3mxQLUjGeMNP0SQ Went there for brunch with friends  and thoroughly enjoyed it. The price is very competitive and the menu, fantastic. The service was excellent and friendly. The only downside was the music which made it difficult at times to be heard by those on the same table or talking to staff.
