This place is amazing. We came here for their 15th year anniversary and they had a special menu for 50$. For the experience, service and the food we had, the price was definitely worth it. 

The food is amazing. All the appetizers came in a very creative manner and it was very fun to eat them. The lobster cappucino was odd but absolutely delicious.The beef/duck tartare was probably one of the best tartare i've had so far. The dessert is so beautiful and there were so many we couldn't finish them all. 

The service is great. The staff is very friendly and welcoming. The place is fancy and the ambiance was great. 

I don't think it's possible to leave this place unhappy.
