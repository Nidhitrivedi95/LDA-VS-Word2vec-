4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Had a reservation for my 10 year anniversary with my wife after seeing Jersey Boys that same night. The food was delicious hostess sat us promptly. Waitress was not so nice when I asked for Sam Adams she looked at me and tapped on the Menu telling me they don't serve it. Maybe it's me but it seemed kind of rude. Wife noticed she treated other tables a lot nicer. Overall nice view of the fountains at the bellagio and loved my Bison Steak.
