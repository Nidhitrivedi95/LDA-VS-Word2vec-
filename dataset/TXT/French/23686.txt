cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg Dear Myles P,
It is obvious that you have no clue how restaurants operate. While I understand being pissed that you were left standing in the rain, that would irk me as well. What I cant stand is customers like you who assume just because you see empty tables that you are entitled to one. Let me explain how a reservation system works... Most busy restaurants seat an earling seating and a late seating. For my restaurant we take reservations from 6:00 to 7:00 and then again from 8:30 to 9:15. The restaurant then does its best to spread those early reservations evenly across those early seating times... 6:00, 6:15, 6:30, 6:45 and 7:00. Now, you might decide to arrive at 5:45 (our hours are clearly stated and we are rushing to finish last minute details before we open, but that is ok please let yourself right in) You might think 'Hey I deserve a table I'm the first one here!' well on a busy night every fucking seat I have is reserved for someone elses ass...not yours. And if you bitch and moan it is just going to make me hate you more...because I am protecting my customers who secured their reservation sometimes weeks in advance and I'm not going to fuck up their reservations because you are a dumbass and think you can walk right in and have whatever table you want on a friday night. 

What will get you a table...
"Hi I am so sorry I'm early, I realize you guys are still setting up and I apologize for getting in the way. We don't have a reservation but is there any way if we hang out at the bar for a while and you have anything open up maybe we could be sat for dinner?"

If you act like that I will do my absolute best to give you the fist table that opens up from a cancellation or a no show. And If I do get you a table a thank you and maybe even a small tip would be a very nice show of gratitude for going out of my way to try and accommodating you.
