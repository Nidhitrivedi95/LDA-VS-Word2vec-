SJo_IjvzdRtCvZVN0cbrRQ Well lets just say not as good as the reviews.
We have stop here 3 times first 2 did not want to wait 3rd time we waited a short time and were seated ordered our breakfast my wife had the eggs with bacon I had the eggs with hash.If you like eating charcoal and washing it down with cold coffee you will love this place. Plenty of other good places for breakfast in the area this is not one of them.
