pmoIMK8zGWvKsVOPDBYfzg I think I've finally found the place to smoke cigars in Vegas. Casa Fuente is overpriced (of course, what a surprise) the wicker furniture is torture after awhile, and when Rhumbar first opened it was nice, but the nightly hip hop DJ and young swagger crowd have killed it for me.

After knowing about it for a year or so, I finally made it down to Andres to check out the cigar lounge. It's upstairs, it's cozy (15-20 people or so would be about the max I think), it's quiet, one big screen and nice comfy furniture.

I was shown upstairs, got a seat, and within a few minutes I was being waited on. I had brought my own cigars to smoke, but I did have several drinks. One of their special drinks and some regular cocktails. For Vegas standards, I'd say the drinks were maybe even a little better than usual for the money.

I stayed for a couple of hours or so. Watched the Sunday night football game, and even had some lobster corn bisque, which was really good.

Let me put it this way, it's small, comfy, the fake fireplace is kinda nifty even, it's dark, and it's quiet, it's damn wonderful. I plan on making this my smoking place, only bad thing is I believe they don't open till 5 pm.
