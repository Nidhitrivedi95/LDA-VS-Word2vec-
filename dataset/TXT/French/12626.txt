4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw WOW. Delicious! Mon Ami Gabi beyond exceeded my expectations! When I filtered through the Yelp search for most reviewed and ratings, both times Mon Ami Gabi popped up in Las Vegas. 

My party and I got here around 8AM and was hoping to get a patio table but the line for the patio was way too long, so we opted for indoors! Our wait was only around 15 minutes or so. Our table was a nice surprise to me- it was actually outdoors with a roof shade over it. So that was nice. We still got a view of the Bellagio Fountain and the Strip. 

Our server was nice and patient with us. I ordered the Eggs Benedict and it was AMAZING. The hollandaise sauce was perfect and the eggs were cooked just right! Not to mention their hash browns are so yummy! 

I would definitely recommend this place to everyone; it's kid friendly as well!
