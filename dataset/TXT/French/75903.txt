ynYEgNimJOyb8dvyr9x0sA We previously ate here about two years ago. Things have changed but not for the better. Everything we ordered was a recommendation of the staff.

Cheese fondue had a rather bitter after taste. The prosciutto on the Matterhorn salad was salty and tasteless. We skipped desert not wanting to experience another disappointment.

The incessant clanging of the order up cow bell was cute the first time.  Oh, and they failed to bring everything we ordered.
