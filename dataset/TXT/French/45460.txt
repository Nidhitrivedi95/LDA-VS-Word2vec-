I came here in January for a friend's birthday the entire group tried the club tasting menu. The food was superb. The amuse bouche was this shot of something with foie gras. Everything came out in artful presentations and tasted great. The langoustine was my favorite and everyone got to try all the different items on the menu since we all ordered different things. The starter was one of the yummiest with clams, don't remember what it was but everyone was asking for more bread to soak up the goodness :D
However there was a "fine print" when the waiter asked us what we want to drink or something we said water, he asked us sparkling or distilled, we said distilled without realizing it was going to be added into our tab. After 2 bottles we started questioning cuz who wants to pay for water when you can drink tap for free so after clarification they refilled with tap water. I think it was a little unfair because we didn't know about the water and you know how vegas is, everything is expensive.
