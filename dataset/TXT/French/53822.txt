There are a lot of fantastic options for restaurants in this price range like L'Express which I think deliver a lot more quality for similar price point. I would happily move up a star if the prices were lower, but that matters to me. The ambiance was quiet when I went there, and while the service was great, it was also a bit slow. We had a solid spread of the menu since I went as a group of 5, and some items were good but none were amazing particularly. Don't get me wrong - I had a good dinner, and good food, but I expected to be impressed a bit more. Maybe I went on an off night, but this is how I see it from my last visit.
