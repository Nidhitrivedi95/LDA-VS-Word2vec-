XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q Not sure what to say..  Bucket list type meal of 16 courses across 5 servings.  My wife and I had never been to a 3 Michelin star restaurant before.  The attention to detail in every course was amazing.  The flavor combinations they were able to create while keeping the dishes "light" was amazing.  We had the prefix 16 course meal which included everything.  It's one of those places  that I don't think I ever need to go to again, but would have missed if I had never made it    there!!  Make your reservation way ahead of time and ask to sit "outside."  It's quiet and worth it!  Also ask for the complimentary car service when you make your reservation.  They only have three, we heard about it from yelp but missed out!
