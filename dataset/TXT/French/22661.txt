bzbNGyrTwWHAgg1CqkSgeg Visiting from Maryland we relied on Yelp to guide us in the right breakfast direction. We found Terrace Café and immediately walked into a warm ambient. 

With pleasure we were served by Whitney and Amy. Wow. No words can describe the excellent customer service we received this morning. When we thought it couldn't have gotten any better... it did. Both were very attentive and made the entire experience absolutely memorable. Completely personable experience. 

The food was impeccable. You can't go wrong with-- Strawberry French toast, Croissant: ham, egg, cheese, and Meat lovers Omelette. They are certainly not rating highly by accident. 

Without a doubt we will visit this restaurant again. Check it out for sure.
