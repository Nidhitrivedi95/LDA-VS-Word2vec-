nWW6fBfBljiRFa4sG7TyxA The food here is really outstanding.  The best I have ever had in Cleveland.  Even better than l'albatross. The only downside is the location.  It is right across the street from a huge low income housing apartment complex.  Because of that there are always shady and ghetto people around.
