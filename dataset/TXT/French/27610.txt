DJcvnN7BCiqOUAra35xYuA We ordered normal portion of the food (five courses for three) and it took more than 50 minutes for the server to have all the food present, and made us miss our meeting session! The server was impolite: no greetings, no thank you, and even no smile. While the food was fine, the service was very disappointing, which made the meal totally unenjoyable at the end! We once looked forward to this restaurant based on Yelp's comments, but unfortunately, it was not that good!
