4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw My wife and I were in Vegas for our honeymoon and stayed at Bellagio.  We had dinner at Mon Ami on a whim our second night and it was fantastic!

The baked cheese appetizer is a must-have, and we really liked the steak frites.  I had the one with Bearnaise sauce and loved it, my wife had the blue cheese and it was great too.

We didn't think breakfast was as good as dinner - the food was good but spendy.  Still, compared to restaurants in the vicinity it was still a value.  It seems like everything's expensive near Bellagio.

It's not cheap - for dinner we had a carafe of their Frangria (think sangria), the baked cheese appetizer, and two steaks.  We were out the door with a good tip for just over $100.  Enjoy!
