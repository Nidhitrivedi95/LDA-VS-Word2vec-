mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q The best french restaurant I've been to. 
I went to a timeshare seminar in Vegas, and got to eat here with a $150 credit.  It is pricy, and I wouldn't have tried it otherwise.. I may go back now after trying some excellent dishes..

We sat at the bar. You can see the kitchen.  We dressed casual. 

Everything was excellent here.  I tried the fois gras sliders - Out of this world! It was the first time I tried fois gras, and it was authentic, and excellent quality. The burgers were awesome. 

My guest loved her food, but I can't remember what she ordered, but she loved it.

We tried the famous mashed potatoes.. and let me tell you..  It was like eating butter! It was so soft!  The flavor was awesome as well.  

The french fries were extremely good. Maybe the best fries I've ever had, and I LOVE FRENCH FRIES!! They were very crispy, and good texture. Flavorful, and salted just right.  YUM!

I tried the "steak tartare" but did not like it. I never had it before, but the taste was rich, and I did not like it. It was like eating dog food to me..  They took it off the bill. 

I tried the baby lamb chops.. and let me tell you.. These were the most tender lamb chops I've ever had.   They were awesome! Tiny, but awesome!  Kind of like a wagyu lamb chop!  They were seasoned good as well.  I recommend this!

for dessert we had the souffle. It was small, served in a thin glass. It was authentic, and good. 

It's rare for me to love so many things at a restaurant, and this was one of the best meals, if not the best meal, I've ever had. 

It was expensive, and even though the timeshare presentation was about 4 hours all said and done... this meal made it worth it!
