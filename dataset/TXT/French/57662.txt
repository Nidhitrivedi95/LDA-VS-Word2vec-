rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Wow! This restaurant is AMAZING!!! I was staying at the Venetian with family (yes, if you've read my other reviews, I do tend to go to Vegas a lot with relatives...) and we decided to try this restaurant when we walked by. Our wait for dinner was not too long and we were so impressed by the food. Starting with the table bread, everything was perfect. The wine we ordered was delicious. Then, I tried the mussels and was in heaven! We also shared some french fries which were fried to perfection. We sat at a gorgeous table in the garden setting by a fountain. While I love Vegas, it was pretty amazing to feel whisked off to another land! Our waiter had a cute accent and was very helpful and sweet.

Because we enjoyed our meal SO much, we decided to return to Bouchon for brunch the very next day. The brunch was also delicious but not quite as impressive as the dinner. I definitely hope to be back dining at Bouchon! This is probably the closest I will get to Napa's French Laundry for a while...
