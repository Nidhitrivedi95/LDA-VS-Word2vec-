vLkKorA1gPS97Zj0_WKA0Q Went here for a post birthday party dinner, for our second dinner! LOL. Juan Carlos took real good care of us. We ordered the appetizers, salads and lobster and seafood entree (we are tired of Waygu, etc. lol) Food was amazing and the price was expensive but expected. However, I still love Guy Savoy at Caesars Palace. Been there over six times in the last three years. It's extremely expensive but worth it!
