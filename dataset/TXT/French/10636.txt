We were able to make a same day reservation for 8 during a large conference, so that was nice. Good service, our waitress kindly split the bill 8 ways. She's smart, knowing that most people will tip extra just because she did that. Sat inside, so we didn't get a fountain view, but that was okay. Overall everyone was very impressed with the place!
