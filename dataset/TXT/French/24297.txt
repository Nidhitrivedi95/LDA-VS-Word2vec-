cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg There is a lot of hype about this restaurant. It IS one of the most famous places to dine in Montreal, and I can see why. The food is succulent, rich, and flavorful. The items on the menu would make any carnivore salivate, and perhaps any vegetarian cover their eyes and plug their nose. However, there are a few tasty salad options (and a catch of the day -  no, not me!) for those who don't get excited about tucking into a plate of pork, beef, poultry, bison, deer or foie gras "fat liver"! The atmosphere is busy, but cosy and a lil romantic. The problem is that because it is so busy and popular, the food comes out a snails pace. My friends and I waited an hour for our appetizers and another hour for our meals. If you're in great company (and you have a bottle of wine on the go), the wait time isn't all that annoying or noticeable, but I'd advise not to go on an empty stomach, unless of course you want to fill up on foie gras poutine. Oh, it exists - but only here!
