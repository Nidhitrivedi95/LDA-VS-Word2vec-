33Tr0eRki1Yamzleu4GMdw This is the best restaurant on this part of town open for breakfast.  The interior is done up authentic genuine French.  When inside if feels like you're actually in France!  The customer service here is well above average.  Sometimes they are slow to make their drinks but it's not their fault that they are popular.  It gets busy so come early.  They just need to hire an extra hand part time just for the morning rush.  The food is phenomenal and Genuine French.  They have an excellent selection of coffee and the taste and presentation are all top notch.  Definitely worth it just for the Authentic French experience
