SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ This was my first time at this restaurant with my girlfriend. We dinned last night on Halloween. Let me say I'm a foodie and have eaten at many places around the country. It started off poorly with checking in with the hostess. We arrived early and just wanted to check in. As a customer, I'm not interested about your prior seatings with customers and how stressed you are. No, smile or a welcome. Hostess being very young for the job and not having the appropriate communication skills, maturity, and dress. Granted, this is a college town. However, if I was the owner, first impressions matter. You want someone mature,knowledgeable and dress more classy than casual attire. We waited at the bar and found the bartender staff very nice, professional, and extremely helpful. 
We were not charged for our drinks after I expressed my discontent to the bartender staff. They were great communicating this to the restaurant staff. Our waiter was great. However, the food quality does not meet the price they are charging. It's way overpriced. I had the beef tenderloin with a bacon reduced sauce. It was way to salty and the beef had a line of tough connective tissue in the middle. Not prime meat!! Seen better at Costco. 
The bathroom floor was slightly wet and looked dirty. The exhaust vent had loads of dust. Overall, this restaurant claims to be slightly upscale and prices its dishes as such. It misses the mark in many small ways. If I was the owner, I would review hostess job, clean the bathrooms, food quality needs to be examined better when coming from kitchen. I doubt prices will change. It's a nice location. It just needs a little better attention to details. I probably won't go back again. Their are other restaurants with better quality.
