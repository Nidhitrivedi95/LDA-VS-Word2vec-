LQ_gYNs5E10IGFE0NOyD7A I enjoy this place. I LOVE the atmosphere. Lovely trees and outdoor seating. They have massive umbrellas to assure the sun doesn't hit your eyes. I liken it to OHSO but smaller, a little dressier, and more romantic. I came on a Sunday where I had unlimited mimosas. Our server was fabulous too. Very attentive. They had a good menu as well. Huge fan of brunch- theirs ranges from traditional bacon and eggs, to captain crunch waffles. I'll come back for sure. I'm confident we can make this place popular!
