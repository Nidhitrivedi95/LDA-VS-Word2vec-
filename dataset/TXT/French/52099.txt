The patio is totally non descript and overlooks a parking lot.  My husband's dinner looked very good, my scallops were fine, served with beet risotto, tasty but there was some sort of puke green sauce that was really weird. The bread pudding was delicious. We walked to music in Stumptown Park after which was nice. A pleasant enough meal but kind of doubt we'll be back.
