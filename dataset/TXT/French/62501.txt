SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ They get upgraded from my last review. Went here again on New Years and because I was so impressed went back again. That says a lot. And yes, the food is delicious. Wait staff still not awesome...that's what is holding them back, and some of the crowded seating (sit outside if you can).
