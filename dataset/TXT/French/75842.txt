ynwARDp7X2fi6hk9XCOSNQ Fine dining at its best, and it doesn't need to break the bank. Two of us went Table d'Hote plus two half bottles of wine for $165 plus tip. Wonderful surroundings and olde worlde style service. The food was excellent and the wines served at perfect temperature by an knowledgeable sommelier. Some dishes actually cooked at the table. Ideal for a romantic a deux evening.
