xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g Thank you so much for making my mother's birthday celebration something she will never forget.  This was my first time at this restaurant, I made my reservation on OpenTable and asked for a table by the window since it was my Mom's first time in Vegas and I wanted to do something nice for her. I honestly thought that my comments would have never been read but they were.  The hostess greeted both of us and told my Mom Happy Birthday.  She was shocked that they knew.

Not only did you get us a table by the window, but we had the corner window.  My mother is from Ohio and I live in California.  When she told me that she wanted to see the Bellagio fountains I thought this this would be the best place.

The service was amazing, I wish I remembered our waitresses name. The food was outstanding.  I had the lamb and my mother had the veal. The wine selection was fantastic. They brought my mom a beautiful birthday desert as well.

I can't say thank you enough to the Eiffel Tower restaurant for making this dinner something that my Mom would never forget.  She was so impressed with everything!  Again can't  say thank you enough.  This is something that my Mother and I will never forget.  Now I need to bring my husband there. I will be back!
