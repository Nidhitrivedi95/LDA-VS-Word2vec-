rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w Not worth it ... Restaurant is very small, tables crowded. Staff was not friendly and seemed put out. Menu was unnecessarily complicated and difficult to work through. Choices were fairly limited. We had the duck for two which was delicious. And the desserts were wonderful ... Chocolate sphere very original and the chocolate soufflé yummy.  Overall not a wonderful experience.
