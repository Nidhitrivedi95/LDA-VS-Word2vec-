ysJo5Jdo29XOBCnKrbUKWg If you have been craving an authentic French experience then Paris 66 is your spot. Upon walking in you see a line of Nutella above a glass container of fresh and colorful macarons. The walls are filled with vintage posters and the chef is conversing with the waiters in French.

My parents and I stopped by for a late lunch around 4pm and were the only patrons. The waitress shared the specials and the menu has a huge variety from savory crepes, quiches, salads, sandwiches, or steak with frites. We ordered the La Trois Fromage with egg, Croque Madame, and La Tartine Savoyarde. Both of my parents said about their dishes of the La Trois, "the right way to make a buckwheat crepes" and the La Tartine, "this raclette reminds me of our trip to Switzerland". My Croque was simple, not overly buttered, and would be great option for brunch. 

To finish off our meal of course we had our minds on those macarons! We each had an espresso and shared a six variety from the waittress's selections. Excellent. 

Paris 66 needs more credit than the stars averaged here on Yelp. Give it a chance and you too will fall in love. Il est un délice!
