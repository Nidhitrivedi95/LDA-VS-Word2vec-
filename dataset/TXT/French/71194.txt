xcmmTXhuMx2fZF2Bt69F4w Was there for the first time today and lets say I'll definitely go back. I loved the food, especially the waffles are to die for (and I am not a waffle person).
Only reason I am giving it four stars though, is because most if their dishes are either seafood and pork. Wish they had other or at least more protein alternatives, like chicken or turkey. Other than that, this place is worth the wait.
