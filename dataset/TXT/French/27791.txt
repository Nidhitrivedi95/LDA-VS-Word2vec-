dU7SLTS6_HWo1YPHZ4DmOw It was a beautiful hot sunny day and just perfect for a French bistro Sunday brunch! Small clean inviting place.  Friendly staff.  Thank goodness, the menu for brunch is just one page. Separated by categories and easy to order.  I ordered the Chorizo Has.  Others ordered the Duck Confit, Steak & Eggs, Mussels, Quiche and onion soup.  It was a wait but we understand since they have to be served all at the same time. The food came and we all loved it!  Onion soup was the best.  My Chorizo Hash topped with two poached eggs was unexpectedly goodI The steak was perfect. Didn't hear any complaints from my family. Not too many French bistros around and I highly recommend this place. We skipped the desserts because a few steps down the road was the best gelato place in town. And of course, the French bakery where you can sit in, have coffee and have some beautiful cakes.
