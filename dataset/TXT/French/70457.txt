xaqW4NkmUCGRRjmLxiFJ6Q Thornhill is finally starting to get some trendy eats! this was a fantastic Instagram find, the most delicious out of this world crepes! 
the menu is designed with heart and soul, it is also designed with hopes that will not pick it apart, so be respectful and choose one of their delicious crepes of the season instead of making your own - you won't be disappointed. 
The best thing though was the sugar cane juice! how insanely delicious - I can not stop reading all the online articles featuring the miraculous benefits natural sugar cane juice does for the body! Seriously - do not pass this tall glass on the rocks up.
Beyond impressed.
