nm4abb_14L3y0TBizNgq7A Walking into this place feels like going back to your Grandma's: knick-knacks everywhere, wood furniture, cosy lighting, comforting food. I tried many things on their menu, including the blue cheese burger, the veggie burger, salads and the poutine, and it never disappointed. Price is good for the large portion size, and they have a good selection of beers. The specials change often (look for the chalkboard!). 

It's perfect for a romantic date. A gem in the often overlooked Vieux-Longueuil.
