YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g This is Master Chef Hubert Keller amazing restaurant at the hart of Mandalay Bay!
The onion soup shooters with truffle oil was appetizing pair it with rosemary focaccia bread and its heavenly.
We ordered the braised beef short ribs and filet with foie gras. Both were very tender and enjoyable. We loved the food experience at Fluer. I wouldn't mind coming back here specially if the Mandalay Bay comps our food.
