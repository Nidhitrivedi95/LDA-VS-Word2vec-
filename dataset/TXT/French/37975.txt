Jbl6p9CVkfCB8fWYFd2-Qw I'm puzzled by the negative reviews. I'm visiting from out of town (but grew up in Cleveland) and had a great experience at Club Isabella. In fact, my family and I went twice -- once for dinner, then the next night to listen to the man playing the piano. He's fantastic. We noticed two members of the Cleveland Orchestra stopped to have dinner after their concert we attended.

The food at the place is also great. Indeed, Cleveland has a phenomenal foodie scene. I'd consider Club Isabella among them.
