pKiSzUlBBRNEdTML24piXA Centurion has great potential in Phoenix, however there are still some things it needs to work on. When we first walked in to the restaurant, I felt a little overwhelmed. The space is kind of small and the decor is a little too full of knick-knacks for my taste. Also, I felt a little teased by the many bottles of booze along the wall, since Centurion does not yet have a liquor license. However, they have an awesome looking patio out front that I can't wait to use once the weather cools down a bit.
 
The staff was super friendly and helpful throughout the meal. The chef made some suggestions with the cheese plate we tried, and it was awesome. I can't wait till they add more cheese to the list to try and they have wine to go with it. The entree, I had was a little lack luster for me. I chose the spinach and shitake mushroom risotto. The risotto was cooked well, but a little too salty for my liking. I also tried a bite of the gnocchi with vegetables. It had a good wine sauce, however, again a little on the salty side. All in all I would definitely like to go back once they have a liquor license. The cheese plate alone was that good!
