xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g The food was very good but not at the level of a 5-star restaurant.  But for a nice night out, very worthy.  The braised short ribs were wonderful.

The service is excellent.  All personel are wonderful.  We requested a widow seat with our reservation for two and got one.

The pricing is not out-of-bounds for this level of restaurant.  However,  be prepared for spending over $200 for two people with wine, salad, entree, no sides and desert.

They have a large and impressive wine list but the pricing is way out-of-bounds at 4 to 10 times retail.

I've been there 4 times now and find the quality to be consistent.  It is a great place for an event dinner (anniversary, birthday, etc.) but not if you are just going for the food.
