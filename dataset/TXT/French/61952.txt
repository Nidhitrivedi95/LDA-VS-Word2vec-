Il me parle tout bas
Je vois la vie en rose..."
- Edith Piaf, "La vie en rose"

After a long week of all work and no play, I really needed a break. I lazily browse around for somewhere that could take my mind off the dreariness of modern life, and I saw this quaint place. Chez Nanou is a delightful bistro that captures the ordinary French aesthetic. The owner is from France, and she wanted to bring the French culinary experience to America.

The food here is delicious. It's French without the pretensions. This is the sort of food you might be served at a bed-and-breakfast in Aix-en-Provence after a long day touring the wine country on a Vespa with your summertime lover. Hearty, good portion size, all-natural and organic, and without the pomp and pretension of haute cuisine. I got the Provençal scrambled eggs with bacon, browned potatoes and a side salad. There's nothing to remark about the bacon and salad, but the eggs and potatoes were quite good. The eggs had Gruyère and herbes des Provençe mixed in, creating a abundantly pungent and savory egg concoction. Personally I am an enormous fan of the food of Southern France precisely because of the earthy fragrance that compose herbes des Provençe - rosemary, thyme, sage, lavender. Like the charmingly rustic countryside of Southern France itself, the food speaks to the ways most people, at the end of the day, look forward to a wholesome, home-cooked meal. For me that day, I was looking forward to peace and quiet away from the bustle of modern life. Here you can get that. Step away from the noise. Take a seat at the checkerboard tablecloth, get a cup of coffee, and escape, even if only in your head, to a better place for a while.
