ovtlrcsVRlgZZQUlHs_ovw Wife and I decided to try something different and new for dinner so we came to vogue.  There were a lot of retirees and a lot of regulars so we figured it should be good. They have waaaay more drinks then they have food options. She couldn't find anything to eat so she settled with bruschetta which she didn't like.  I got the vogue burger because I didn't feel like paying a million dollars on a dish that could be mediocre. The burger was awesome and well cooked.  They seemed to have an army of waiters and waitresses yet the service was insanely slow.  We got the wrong bill and waited forever to get a chance to pay it.  In the end.... it's a strip mall restaurant trying to be high end.
