1idRJwqXxxmgSyQRKag4KQ What a cute, quaint restaurant! A group of four girlfriends and I dined here for a nice meal on our trip to Toronto. Make reservations! There's only about 20 seats in the house. The restaurant is warm with a cozy vibe with stellar, attentive service. Being able to see the chefs preparing your meal in the open kitchen was also a plus.

When we arrived, our table was not yet ready so we were greeted with glasses of wine and a complimentary appetizer. I love restaurants that know the importance of hospitality.

Between the five of us, we were able to try:

-Lobster Bisque
-Duck Margret
-Scallops and King Crab, Drunken Lobster
-Braised Beef

My dish was the duck. It was cooked and seasoned perfectly; the meat was tender and melted in your mouth. Tied for favorite would be the scallops and king crab--the flavor was delicious. Lobster bisque was also seasoned well. 

For dessert, we ordered soufflés to split. They were very large, fluffy, and melted in your mouth. A very tasty treat, but definitely too much food after our delicious entrees!

It's easy to immediately see this restaurant is one that puts its heart into treating its patrons with care and serving delicious, well-crafted food. This place is a great example of culinary done right. Definitely worth a try!
