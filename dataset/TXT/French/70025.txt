WUq7NNgCTaPphTYL6qyEBQ I've been here a few times and the French bistro fare has been good and sometimes very good. The ambience is perfect for a cozy neighborhood bistro. The service is usually very good but my most recent visit on Valentine's Day was a bit disappointing.  Nothing horrible but not very good either particularly when there was a fixed menu.  Overall, a solid 3 stars. There are better options nearby so it may be awhile before I return.
