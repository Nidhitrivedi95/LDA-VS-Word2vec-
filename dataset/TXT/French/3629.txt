1ThbwFVBL9YA2oOM11iO7g For a restaurant that marks itself as Cuban, the menu isn't a very good indicator that they're attempting to create anything other than hautely prepared french bistro-country food.  The dishes were all texturally and visually delicious, but lacked in flavor.  

That's not to say the food wasn't excellent - but after basking in the warm ambiance of the cozy space, which has a rustic modern graphic-chic decor, I was expecting to be blown away.  

The place was almost packed, but without that uber-trendy lineup, and the server was knowledgeable and playful, a plus for us 4 girls who hadn't seen each other in half a year and wanted photos taken and flirtations thrown around, giddy as can be.  He dealt with us well, and we never had to lift a finger to have our wine glasses filled.  One of our group is vegan, and he had no problem accommodating her diet by checking with the kitchen, who offered the vegetables pimped up a little from one of the meat dishes.  (it looked like a sad story of a meal to me, but she seemed ok about it - vegan is a tough subject in dinning that i don't want to get into).

The best part about the meal was a) the wine and friends, and b) the dessert of buttermilk doughnuts, which were the reason we chose Delux; a friend read an article where they were ranked as one of the top 13 doughnuts in Toronto.  There was a bowl of them, timbits size, and a bowl of Chantilly cream to dip into; a totally decadent and wholly unnecessary finish to our feast.  

I'd go again but only for the ambiance, dessert, and perhaps some oysters - though they could be cheaper.
