rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw We came for brunch our first day in Vegas. The restaurant is tucked away inside the second story inside the Aria hotel and is beautiful inside. Lots of rose centerpieces, soft lighting and gorgeous bar with gold shelves holding their liquor including an impressive selection of chartreuse. We showed up for our 1:30p reservation 10 minutes late as we had a difficult time finding it and the hostess let us know the kitchen would close in 5 minutes so we had to order quickly. We were seated and right away I knew I wanted a Benedict. I tried the short rib Benedict served on croissants and a cappuccino. The cappuccino was wonderful, also came with a hefty $6 price tag. In the Benedict I loved the texture and flavor of the short rib, and would've liked a bit more hollandaise sauce and fresher croissants as they tasted a bit stale. The butter that accomplished the complimentary bread was to die for, the bread was nothing special. I'm glad I ate here though not a place I would return to with so many options in Vegas.
