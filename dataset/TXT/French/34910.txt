HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw This restaurant never disappoints. I've been there about 5 times in the course of two years and I've not had anything short of fantastic.

Please, you must try this place out, even if it's just for the cocktails, which are delicious. It's not your average bar (they call themselves a prohibition bar), so don't expect ALL your favorites to be made there, but their cocktails are both unique and unforgettably brilliant. Try the bison grass vodka on the rocks. Or the Bastille 1789 whiskey.

If you dine there, ask for Nick. He not only is a fantastic server, he's also a foodie and can help steer you to just the right meal and recommend wine/cocktail pairings.
