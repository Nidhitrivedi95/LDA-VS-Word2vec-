b3wgQ6CccBO8fgvlbS0M1Q A friend of mine and I have been going here for lunch for a while. Our tradition would include escaping from school/work on Mondays and meeting up here for lunch. The coffee is good, the pastries are great, and the food is excellent. They used to have this iced tea there (but seemed to have swapped it for something else as of late) that was unbelievable. We called it the "Tea of Freedom." It tasted like a promising adventure awaiting you just around the corner. Stop laughing! It was really damn good iced tea. But just as it came into my life, it was gone just as elusively.

The owners are accommodating and charming. On slow days we would see him sitting outside with a demitasse of espresso and reading French newspaper, only to hop to his feet when we walked in. 

It does appear the prices have gone up, and they're approaching steepness for a cafe, but this is the Biltmore after all. 

Highlight: Don't know what to get? Ask for a recommendation. You won't be sorry.
