qTacF-_Iucc1Nxom_Za_5Q French food and French attitude. Another customer service fail at a place with such great potential.  A large front patio with an outdoor space in the back and a tasteful high quality menu with a great looking bar.

Our server was rude all the way up until it came time to collect her tip. Typical at all of the rose & sons related venues. Good food, bad people. 

I would come back to enjoy the patio but my expectations for quality service are nonexistent.
