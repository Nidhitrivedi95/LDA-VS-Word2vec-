XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q So this is my first time here. Heard so much about it. We had a party of 5. It's a prefix menu we order the 5 course meal which cost around $200 n my other friends is 6 course for $250. I like there bread cart and the comp dessert cart. Everything was ok to us. No complaints. The place is very fancy n quite. Server was great.
