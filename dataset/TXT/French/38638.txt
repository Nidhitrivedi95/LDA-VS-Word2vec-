jLxeBgWhLRbII2ACkgH1Sg That's my favorite cafe when I want to get sweet something. I've never disappointed to the flavorful pastry and bread, also I'm satisfy with them. The pastry is not too sweet, perfect sweetness for me and an excellent flavor of the butter. Also the French bread has nicely crispy outside and moist and elastic inside. I usually mist it with water and warm it up in the oven at home before eat it though when I have the bread at home. That's the best way to have delicious hard bread. I think the place is an authentic French bakery style cafe, I've never visited to France though. Definitely try them!!
