XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q Quite possibly the best meal one can have in North America.  Last time we were there we did the 16 course tasting with two other couples.  We had arranged for our wine ahead of time and the sommelier had it ready to go.  

The setting is very nice.  Being greeted at the private pull up and then walked through the closed to the general public areas is always a great way to start.  The decor is an homage to 1920s Paris and I think pulled off very well.

Service is second to none.  What I enjoy is that staff treat people in an intelligent manner.  They are people that know their stuff so do not come off as automatons like the staff at some other well known places (Alinea, I'm talking about you).

The food?  What can one say?  It was truffle season when we were there and one trio course had more truffles on it than I have ever seen on one plate.  Execution is always flawless, plates designed to be attractive and make sense, and the seasonal menus are greatly appreciated.

A well rounded experience there is not going to come cheap but why skimp on things like wine when you are having a meal of this quality?  Expect the bill to be in the $700-800 per person range...and expect to walk away thinking it's worth every cent.

P.S. Cannot say enough about the cheese and bread carts.
