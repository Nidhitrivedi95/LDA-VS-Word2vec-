rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Can I have fries with a side of steak?

The fries here are legendary. If I had only 1 meal in vegas, I would get my ass down to Bouchon and order frites and some entree to go with it. 

We got here late but made it before the morning service ended. I had the steak n eggs - perfect medium steak with perfect sunny side ups, accompanied with sauteed potatoes fried together with caramelized onions in the steak jus. Very good.

My companion had the rainbow trout served with cauliflower and capers. The flavors melded together beautifully.

I ordered the frites as an addition, and we almost finished all of it. It's skinny feather light crisp and fluffy frites that are very very addictive. Words cannot do it justice.
