rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A One of the best restaurants  I've ever been to. Went with my gf and my sister. Awesome service with great recommendations. The bone marrow dish was amazing. Truffle fries I would also say were probably the best fries I've ever had. The French Onion soup was basically like drinking a steak. It was so rich and incredible. Overall a must visit if you live in Las Vegas.
