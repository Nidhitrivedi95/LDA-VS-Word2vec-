aSC-WLyJptVpziJpR98Ykg Not bad at all but somewhat overrated based on my personal experience there. $63 seemed excessive for 3 kir royals that our party ordered
Apps were fair. The ceviche seemed likely mostly veggies and little tuna. 

Entrees were good but lacked flair. 
Male server pleasant but lacking any warmth or enthusiasm. 
Female who brought our dishes and described the preparations was warm,pleasant, and informative. 

Nothing wrong with this meal but it was by far our most expensive in Montreal and it really was not memorable in any way.
