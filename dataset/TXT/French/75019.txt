XZ7eQLjyGXf6y69UT4SGhg I had no idea what the hell a galatte was when I came here. Actually I'm still not 100% sure what it is, but all I know is that it tastes good. Take the risk my friend. 

Came here for brunch with the sister,  don't see too many good french places off the strip. No one wants to go down to the strip. That's the dark side.

Small little cafe, but they had a large assortment of pastries and crepes. And these crepe like things called galattes, which i guess  could be compared to an omelette pancake. Staff was friendly and the pricing isn't too bad.

The only thing I could of gone without, is the sight of all the middleaged women coming in their ill fitted yoga pants. That's Spring Valley for you.
