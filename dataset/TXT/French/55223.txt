rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Not to be confused with the Bouchon Bakery located in the Venetian Casino, the Bouchon Bistro is located within the Venetian Hotel towers and is a seat-in restaurant.  I came here due to the 15% coupon that was given to me during my stay.  However, the coupon is only valid Monday through Thursday and my visit was during the Sunday morning brunch.  Although I could not redeem my coupon, I am glad I tried this place out.

The place is absolutely gorgeous and elegant.  Sunday mornings consist of mostly family diners and is very low-key for vegas.  Service is exceptional and there was hardly a wait to get seated.  I think my party waited less than ten minutes when they had originally estimated a wait time of 20 to 30 minutes.

When seated, we immediately placed our order.  My sister and I went fairly classic and ordered the all American breakfast or what Bouchon calls the Petit Dejeuner Americaine:  two eggs served any style with bacon, sausage, toast, your choice of pastry, juice, and coffee.  For pastry choice, I got the strawberry croissant and it was divine.  The croissant had all the elements of a perfect croissant; it was airy, flakey, and buttery, but had a hint of sweetness from the strawberries on top.  Seriously, the best croissant I have ever had.  The rest of the dish hits the spot for a fulfilling breakfast.

This place is a definitely must for morning brunch!!
