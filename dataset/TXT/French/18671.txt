aervNtqzrKf0CGrFo4xfKw Great atmosphere in a very stylish restaurant, much larger than you'd expect. The appetizers were great, the ceviche could've used more fish, but that's about the only slightly negative thing I could say.

We had tourtière and veal as our mains, the veal was cooked perfectly to a medium rare and the tourtière was full of flavour.

The deserts were a perfect contrast, a tart cranberry and cherry crêpe and a very sweet pudding chômeur. 

The service was outstanding, couldn't say enough good things about our server
