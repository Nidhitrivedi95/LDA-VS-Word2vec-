aervNtqzrKf0CGrFo4xfKw Woke up late on Easter Sunday. Walked out of the house wanting a late lunch somewhere. I headed to Bistro Camino only to find it closed so what the heck, it's a nice day, I wanted to go down to the beaches anyway, and maybe read a book. I figured I'd have a go at trying Le Papillon on my way there. 

Walked in right after brunch had ended so I was really the only person dining there at the time. So "lunch" had just turned into an early, early dinner. Ordered the steak frites medium rare and sat back to read while they prepared it.

Disappointed to find that it was cooked closer to medium than medium rare. I've done more tender steaks from chinese supermarket flank cuts in comparison to this relatively chewier AAA striploin. The maitre d'hotel butter hindered more than helped the taste of the meat by overpowering it. The frites were nothing to write home about either. 

I might be tempted to go back for a try of their brunch at least once (that second floor patio of their's just looks too good to pass up).
