htQgj-ANQpZGpIpkkrEmyQ These pictures come from my fifth visit to the restaurant. I would give this restaurant a 5/5 for their the INSP burger alone. AMAZING. By far, one of the best burgers that I have ever had in Toronto - actually in all of Ontario. It is succulent, juicy, it is cooked PERFECTLY. It is leaking with juices when you eat it and it combines wonderfully into your mouth. It's juicy but not overly greasy. 10/10. Come get the burger. 

The other dishes that I've tried: udon carbonara, chicken and waffles, duck confit fries. The things that I've tried that dont' seem to be on the menu on their site: salmon poke bowl; korean breakfast pork belly hash type of dish; breakfast burrito; red velvet ball dessert. 

I would say of all their other dishes that I've tried, they're okay. The breakfast burrito was BOMB diggity as well, the flavours were fused together beautifully but I haven't run into it since. All the other dishes are okay, they're definitely not bad, but they're definitely not homeruns either. It's like they're all close to getting amazing but all missing something as well. They dont' fuse together amazingly. 

Make sure you call in or e-mail ahead of time to make reservations as it's a small space and they get quite busy. Their service is also great! The people there are very friendly, very easy to get along with and care about whether or not you have a great dining experience.

Definitely go. Definitely get the burger.
