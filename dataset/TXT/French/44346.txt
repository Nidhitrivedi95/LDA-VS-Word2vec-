$25 Breakfast Buffet

Charlotte's best kept secret for Sunday Funday Brunch! Totally worth the price - especially if you love mussels, oysters, and shrimp. Everything is in abundance and fresh! The buffet options are plentiful and have your breakfast staples. Some things are also made to order. Can't go wrong with brunch here, just make sure you place a reservation or arrive earlier than the actual time you want to eat.

Sunday Funday - no doubt!
