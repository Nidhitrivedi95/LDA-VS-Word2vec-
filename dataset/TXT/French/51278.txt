P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ In our extensive experience of dining at the finest restaurants in the country, we'd place Guy Savoy's Restaurant in Las Vegas in a list of the five best restaurants in the nation.  Tonight, Wednesday, 11 Jan 2017, we dined on their Innovation-Inspiration Menu, which consisted of the following:

First, Mitchell enjoyed a glass of 2006 Dom Pérignon Vintage Brut; while I had Krug Rosé from a .375 liter bottle.

Amuse Bouche - Lobster "Candy" - Seaweed Granité
Langoustine - "Pomme Maxime" - Golden Osetra Caviar
- Grüner Veltiner - Nikolaihof - Wachau - Austria
  -  -  -  If langoustine isn't fresh, it isn't good.  This was spectacularly done and delicious, and the wine pairing was just spot on!
Octopus like a "Pot au Feu"
- Ruinart - Champagne Rosé
  -  -  -  Mmmmm, octopus!  What a clever and inventive way to prepare and serve it!  Made us crave octopus at home, and a week later, that's what we did!
Salmon Iceberg
- Yves Leccia - Domaine d'E Croce - Patrimonio - Corsica, Italy - 2011
Wild Atlantic Turbot - Bean Sprout and Green Curry
- 2011 Les Baudines - Chassagne-Montrachet Premier Cru - Vincent & Sophie Morey Vineyard - Burgundy - France
  -  -  -  The fish was delish!  The green curry was very subtle and lovely.  I'm not at all big on curry, so when it is not the main forward flavor in a dish, that can be a delightful thing, like this was.
Seared Foie Gras - Apple Textures and Buckwheat
- 2011 Pinot Gris - Grand Cru Mambourg - Alsace - France
  -  -  -  Another surprisingly tasty treat.  Mentioned to the Chef that Rhubarb and Buckwheat are close relatives, and might be worth playing with in season.
Artichoke and Black Truffle Soup - Toasted Mushroom Brioche - Black Truffle Butter
- 2014 Les Champs Claude - Vielles Vignes - Santenay - Burgundy - France
  -  -  -  Makes me feel bad for anyone who hasn't had truffles, and with the artichoke, it was a marriage made in some wonderful place, hmm, my mouth?
Roasted Quail Breast and Eggplant Textures
- 2013 - La Bernardine - M. Chapoutier - Châteauneuf-du-Pape - Rhône - France
  -  -  -  Too often, quail and squab are a bit of a pain to eat due to small size and bones.  This was not the case, here.  We were able to really enjoy this treat and the red wine went with it beautifully.
Grilled Pluma Iberica - Flavors of a Caesar Salad
- 2011 Chateau Malescot - St Exupeery - Margaux - Bordeaux - France
Aged Comté and Vin Jaune 
- 2011 Domaine Berthet-Bondet Cotes du Jura Savignin
  -  -  -  Nice combination of flavors from eastern France, which I had visited just a few months ago.  We're going, together, in March/April this year, and also plan to eat at Guy Savoy's place in Paris.
"From Beet to Sweet"
Carrot and Orange
- 2010 Château La Rame - Sainte-Croix-du-Mont - Bordeaux - France
Native Pineapple
Chocolate "Mole" Tartine
- 2008 Philip Togni Black Muscat Ca' Togni - Sweet Red Wine - Napa Valley - California

Photos of the food and wines and more details will appear after I get them in an email from the restaurant.  Should be within a few days.  Thanks for reading, and for looking at those pics as soon as they were mounted, Carrie!

We ended our evening of dining with Mitchell enjoying some Cuvée 1880 Grand Marnier while I had a bit of Hors d'Age Calvados from DOMAINE DUPONT.
