In a strip mall near the corner of Rampart and Lake Mead, there is ample parking but all the spots in front were marked 20 minute parking so I didn't park there.

There is a small menu for breakfast--a couple of omelettes and some breakfast paninis.  I chose the ham and cheese omelette and a black coffee.  I then took my seat and the very nice woman who took my order soon brought the coffee.  It was rich and strong with a good flavor.  Then the omelette came.  The egg was very fluffy and it was served with four thick slices of very tasty baguette.

The ham was thin lunch meat and there was a good amount to go with the cheese.

I would like to have more of a choice at breakfast but given the small size of the place, I guess I can't expect a large menu.  I enjoyed my breakfast.
