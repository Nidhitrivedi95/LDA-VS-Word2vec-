4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw My friends and I stopped by for a late lunch.  We only had a few hours before dinner so we weren't super hungry.  I ordered the baked brie (served with roasted garlic and toasted bread), one of my friends ordered the arugula salad with walnuts, grapefruit and goat cheese, and my other friend ordered the smoked salmon (served with bread, capers and creme fraiche).  We ordered a small carafe of a St. Germaine cocktail (it was $12.50 for the carafe and we got about 5 short drinks out of it).  Before our food came out they brought us warm bread with delicious butter, and this grated carrot salad marinated in honey along with other things.  It was delicious! Our food came out shortly after and we loved all three of our dishes.  I forget our servers name but he was super nice and prompt.  I would love to go back to try their entrees.  Our dishes were a little bit pricey but definitely not too bad for being on the strip.
