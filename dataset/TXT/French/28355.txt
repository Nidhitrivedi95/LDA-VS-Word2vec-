EEIz44ewHhOKmfTloAK13g This place is all the good things people review about. Despite making reservations 2 months ago, we finally sat down last night and enjoyed the 5 course tasting menu plus the 3 dessert dishes. 

Despite the recommends, I didn't do the wine pairing. The server indicated it was predominately whites, which included ice wines and some glasses of ports. Unfortunately I prefer my reds so I made my own choices. 

The detail they put into this meal as well as the service overall are top notch. The city just doesn't do it like that anymore. I got up twice within the 3 hours we were there and every time I was approaching the table there was someone there to pull my chair out and tuck me in. 

We had dinner reservations at 6:15 and we left there by 9. Prepare to dine and relax. And it's worth every single second!
