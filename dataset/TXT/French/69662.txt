WOd8tWsh2Yt_osHv-ngx_w Universel is a classic Montreal brunch spot I never get sick of. Their menu isn't particularly creative compared to other brunch places in MTL, but it is definitely a safe bet. It's quite busy on the weekends so it's best to try and go early to avoid waiting.

Their eggs benny selection is extensive and very popular. I love getting a salty and sweet combo at breakfast, so to get the best of every world I have hacked the menu. Universel Breakfast--your choice of meat, sweet treat (waffles, french toast, or crepes), eggs, and hashbrowns). Here's the trick, get your eggs poached, english muffin as the toast, and a side of hollandaise--eggs benny plus!
