Ycp3Agr7dt71TZkeKV7jng Random fact: My first work lunch living in Toronto as a young professional was here. Still thankful it was free because I was poor as hell at the time! 

Anyway, I am not sure why it has only above average reviews. For a cafe/lunch spot, it rivals the best in the city! My guess is: 

a) place is always busy and lunch garbage is everywhere
b) they've never had a chocolate walnut cookie
c) couldn't figure out the wifi password

Whatever it is, I do want to reiterate B) they've never had a chocolate walnut cookie!!! This thing is ridiculously good and I don't even like sweets. 

My advice is, try a cookie, and then decide. While you're at it, try a sandwich, and other baked goodies. You'll be glad you did it.
