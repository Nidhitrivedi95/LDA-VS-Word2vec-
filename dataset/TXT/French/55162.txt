rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Didn't live up to its Yelp rating. It's so hard to find. Casino direction was not clear. We went there for Brunch. We had the famous Croque Madame and French Toast. The Croque Madame was good, but not worth the price tag. French Toast was too moist and lack flavors. The wait was an hour, if it was not for the Roulette Table that kept me busy, I would not have waited.
