m9aFZk1f8tSv248YErbpQA So place looked cute and was really looking forward to ordering... we were sat (to clarify we walked inside and asked to be sat and there were about three empty tables one 2 person and 2 four person tables. Outside there were another two or three empties. We were asked if we would prefer inside or out. We choose out and were directed to the end table of two... upon which we sat and were given menus) then we proceeded to watch person after person sat after us recieve food and coffee and in general acknowledged. Unfortunately the man who seated us (the rude apparently owner) finally approached us and we told him we had been waiting for 15 minutes... he told us we weren't. My friend said no one has come to speak to us and we watched others seated after us served. He arrogantly and rudely said well I am speaking to you now. What do you want to do order or go??? At that point I stood up and said we are leaving and he got even ruder and made a comment I can't begin to repeat... it was  racist. Do NOT go here with friends of any skin color. They apparently don't serve "mixed" parties. Its 2017... racism is real. He was exceptionally rude and derragatory to my black girlfriend if thats not racist I don't know what is. So yeah you are a racist sir and you are RUDE.
