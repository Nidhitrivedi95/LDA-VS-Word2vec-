WOj8nPos3R9IIf0Pyttd8g Flew back into Charlotte last night.  Wife had responsibility to choose where we would go for an early dinner.  She did GOOD in choosing Lulu.

Located on the ever-changing Central Ave, this old house is a hidden in plain sight wonder.  The interior is simple elegance with linen-covered tables, two stemmed glasses per place and the casualness of a French bistro.  

Menu was simple, but difficult in that there were too many great options from which to choose.  Wish I had been hungrier,but we both managed to order.

Wife had their vegetable soup and a special salad.  Not crazy about the soup, but loved the salad and, of course, loved the appetizer of fried green tomatoes, one of her favorite munchies.

I took a risk with the duck.  I love duck and usually will order it when I find it on menus, but am near always disappointed because chefs just cannot bring themselves to cook it more than a blood red, cold rare center.  Uck to me!

Well, the duck was a breast and confit served over delicious mushroom risotto.  And the BIG bonus was that I could order the duck breast cooked as I would prefer.  I asked for at least medium (inconsideration and not wanting to insult the chef) to a light medium well.  AND I GOT IT!

Great flavor and the portion was generous.  Also had a house salad which was a great accompaniment to the duck.  

A good selection of house wines, a bit pricey at $9 a glass, but the zinfandel I had was terrific.

We left happy and will return and recommend Lulu to others.
