oS96aJIHFWcFAlGHKKXjaw I'm so unbelievably sad that they stopped making kouign aman, but I guess I can forgive them because the la gourmandise and the tuna baguettes are so good. 
The tuna baguette is just simple tuna salad with cucumber, tomato, red onion, and mayo on a perfectly crunchy/chewy baguette. A simple lunch that would have a difficult time being more delicious.
They do have a cocktail table where you can stand and eat your pastry or sandwich, or you can go to the park across the street and enjoy some of the rare pittsburgh sunshine. Or, if your like me, you can drag your preggers self to your car and devour the entire baguette while other drivers stare at you. I promise not to judge!
