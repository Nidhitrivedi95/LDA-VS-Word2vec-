D87tFO-R6U8f4-e0r4Zq_g On a recommendation from the concierge at the hotel in which I was staying, I came here on a beautiful Monday morning.  This place did not disappoint and I enjoyed such a wonderfully colorful conversation with the owner.  Food was on point, service was delightful and I really had no reason to do anything else in Toronto as I felt so welcomed here.  Alas, other customers were coming in and I needed to move on, but do not be mistaken, Crepes a GoGo will be visited again on my next visit to Toronto.
Veronique is the best.
