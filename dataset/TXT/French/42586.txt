LI2gZ017EM3_5gy8Z1QR9w This is a gem of a restaurant in the neighbourhood.  The brunches on sunday are absolutely fantastic and priced about the same as any place on Queen West would be, the only difference being that the food here is superior.
For example the Salad Nicoise is made with a fresh tuna steak grilled to perfection with a lovely salad and green beans garnished with plenty of olives and a lovely poached egg !!! 
Even the marmalade they have here is fantastic. I hope too many people don't find out about this secret place coz it makes other establishments I have been to for brunch look total crap.
