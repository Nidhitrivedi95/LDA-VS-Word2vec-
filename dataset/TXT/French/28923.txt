el-3IdlW3bTCSnquLvH-3w Google Maps might direct you to the wrong part of this complex (they're actually in behind Starbucks) but this restaurant is well worth seeking out! The wait staff was very pleasant and helpful. The food was delicious. We left with food in hand (portions were large) from Sunday brunch and are already planning our next visit for dinner. My wife and I are so happy to have discovered this French gem.
