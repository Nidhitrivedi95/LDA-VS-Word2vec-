We came around 9pm on a Wednesday and after reading the reviews here on Yelp, were not alarmed that there weren't too many people in the restaurant. Go in! You won't regret it!

Our waiter was incredibly nice and helped us through the menu which is entirely in French. We chose and recommend the following:
- Mussels: best cooked mussels each of us has had in a while. Perfect appetizer to split or meal for one 
- Tartiflette: Duck, potatoes, mushrooms, and I think ham, all covered in cheese! What's not to like?! This was the showstopper and a must order
- Bavette: Extremely tender cut of beef in a gravy like sauce and served with French fries. Recommend!
- Lamb Meatballs: don't remember the French name for this one, but it was a special served in tomato sauce with rice and vegetables. 

We had such a lovely time and enjoyed the atmosphere with leather bound books and dim lighting. Will certainly come again and recommend to friends!
