bzbNGyrTwWHAgg1CqkSgeg went to terrace cafe for breakfast this morning for a quick meeting.  i wasn't starving so i ordered a bacon/cheese biscuit which came with hashbrowns.  the food was good but not great.  

the cafe was pretty busy for a wednesday morning and our waiter had a party upstairs so the service could have been better but i'd probably give it another try when i have a bigger appetite.
