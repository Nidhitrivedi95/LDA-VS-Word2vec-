JsAjP49bCk9KjJmmmjyM4w When I was sick of all the normal breakfast food in my house, I decided to venture out into the great culinary hodge-podge that is Queen West. I had always seen tons of young Toronto hipsters leaving this locale with yummy smelling coffee and brown bags filled with French goodies. So I decided to see what all the hype was about. 

If you can't afford a trip to France for some fine European Cuisine - stop in Clafouti for the next best thing. Their signature treat, Clafouti, is a flan with wild berries. They also serve a selection of other fruit tarts, like raspberry, apricot, apple, lemon, etc.  If you think you're able to get out of the store without eating everything you purchase, you must pick up some pain au chocolate, croissants and breads. 

They also have a line of sandwiches at lunchtime, and I was fortunate enough to try the mouth-watering tomato bocconcini pesto baguette. The cheese was fresh and soft and delicious and the tomatoes were sweet and succulent. Their latte was the perfect zing I needed to get me up in the morning and the aroma of the drink filled my whole house. The prices are pretty good too, and best of all you won't have to try and remember all that grade nine French!
