4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I was here exactly a week ago & I really liked it. It's cute, very Parisian & with a great view of the Eiffel Tower. The food was great! I got French toast & they were to die for, just delicious! We kinda missed breakfast and got the brunch and the regular menu. Most def will return!
