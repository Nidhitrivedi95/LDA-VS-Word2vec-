rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A This place is fantastic. As soon as I saw the menu I knew I had to go for Brunch. This was before I even realized that it's a Thomas Keller restaurant. 

We ended up going for Breakfast during the week, which has a slightly smaller menu than Brunch, but were still extremely happy with all the food, and had a hard time deciding on what to order.

We were able to grab a table outside, overlooking the Pool area at the Venetian, which gave it a nice French feeling. I started off with a Cafe au lait, which was delicious. I was really looking forward to trying one of their Champagne Cocktails, which all sounded delicious, but alas with it being our last day, I was just exhausted and needed an IV drip of caffeine. Our server kept the coffee coming for us. 

We started off with the Beignets, which came with a side of nutella and their house made strawberry jam. They were delicious, like beignets should be. The real star though was the strawberry jam. I asked if they sell it, but sadly they no longer do. I would totally buy some though. *hint hint* 

I ordered the quiche du jour, which was a quiche Lorraine. It came with a side salad, but I substituted fries. I wish I hadn't because they give you enough fries to feed a small country. My boyfriend's Croque Madame came with more than enough fries for both of us. Seriously, I am a french fry fiend and it looked like I hadn't even touched them. The quiche was fantastic though, very rich and tasty. My boyfriend loved his Croque Madame as well. The Mornay sauce was quite tasty. 

For breakfast this is a bit on the higher end, but the location, ambiance, service, drinks and food all make it worth it. I would definitely be back, hopefully for dinner or Brunch next time, and make sure and get one of those champagne cocktails.
