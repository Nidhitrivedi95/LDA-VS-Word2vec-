SFnrHuVFSNiondFVUBLJZQ These were by far the best crepes I've ever had. Even one of the better meals I've had. We got the apple, cheese, and maple syrup crepe and a strawberry, banana, and chocolate. The apple crepe was amazing.  As the case with most places we went to in Montreal.  The service was a bit lacking, but very polite.  The restaurant itself was also very charming and good for people watching.
