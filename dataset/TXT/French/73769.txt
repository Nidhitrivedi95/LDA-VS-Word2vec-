xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g We have eaten at the Eiffel Tower Restaurant before and had found it to be ..just ok.  Last week we booked it for my birthday.  The views are simply amazing and our booth overlooked the Bellagio fountains.  
But even better was our meal and the service.  Nicholas Johnson-Tatum (he gave me is business card) was our captain and waiter.  I highly suggest asking for him, as it was impeccable service.  
Will definitely go back
