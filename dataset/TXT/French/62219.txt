SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ A friend and I spent a lazy Sunday afternoon at the House of Tricks before heading off to a show at Gammage.  

It's right off of Mill Road, so a very quick convenient drive to Gammage.   The parking was very adequate for the location-- parked right out front with NO searching. 

We were a bit early for our dinner reservations, so we sat at the outdoor bar and had a few glasses of wine and split the Pecan Smoked Salmon appetizer.  It was an enormous piece of salmon cooked to perfection with a little side salad, onions, capers, and an olive tepenade.  It was served with bruscetta and crackers-- it was a great starter!   The outdoor bar seating was wonderful.  Vine covered patios and lots of plants and foliage, which I love that garden-y feel.  

We were taken to a beautiful garden area for dinner-- really had that English garden appeal.  

I had the Arugala & Roasted Squash salad.   It was really delicious, but I would have liked a bit more of the squash.  It only had a sprinkling of small diced pieces of squash, where I was hoping for good big bites.  It was still really good, though.

For dinner I had the Pork Loin with a potato gratin, asparagus, and topped with a "red flame grape agrodolce', which added a nice tangy taste.  The gratin, I felt, was a bit dry- as the potatoes were sliced super thin.  

For dessert I had the dark chocolate mousse with raspberry preserves-- AMAZING!!  

The service was A+, the atmosphere was A+, the wine was A+, and the food was a solid A... 

I would absolutely go back and will probably my new 'go to' place before a show at Gammage.
