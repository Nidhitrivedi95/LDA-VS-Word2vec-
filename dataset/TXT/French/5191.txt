3FlWR_osNPb8dcqLgHebHw Mimi has always been a hit and miss with me.  However my kids for some reason or another loves this place.

I ordered the bouillabaisse, which was perfect to my taste buds.

My wife ordered the chicken pot pie and it was disgusting because the color of the inside was orange looking instead of the creamy white soft bread.  The chicken tasted old as well.

My kids ordered the lobster bisque, salad, spaghetti with meat sauce. 

Hopefully they get better or I don't see them getting any new customers.
