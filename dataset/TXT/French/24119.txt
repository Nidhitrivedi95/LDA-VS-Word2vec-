cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg Do you like foie gras?  piggy?  shellfish platters?  If you answered no to these questions, don't go to PDC.  If you said yes, then beg, borrow or steal yourself a reservation to this reasonably priced, extremely delicious, fun and casual restaurant.

We got insanely lucky, and our hotel was able to get us a same-day reservation... and then once we were there the sous-chef was nice enough to squeeze us in again the following night.  PDC two nights in a row!

It's hard to pick the pinnacle of the meals... was it when we were served a pig's head, with a lobster in the pig's mouth?  or perhaps it was one of the many astounding foie gras dishes... or maybe the two 'ducks in a can' that we got as takeaway food, to eat after we'd gone home from Montreal.

PDC is advertised as being a great place for lovers of pork, foie gras and shellfish, and it does what it says on the box.
