4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Welcome to Disney Land!  A beautiful façade of a Parisian cafe worthy of a single visit.  After that, the spell breaks.  

Quick and dirty:

- Three dining spaces (outdoor overlooking LV Blvd facing the Fountains of Bellagio, indoor sun room, indoor steak house). 

- Three check-in lines (outdoor wait list, indoor wait list, confirmed reservation).

- Franco / American café menu at reasonable prices.  

- Great selection of French wines by the glass or bottle.  Glass prices are VERY high.

- Friendly, bordering on unprofessional service (faked French accents for some tables, Parisian style silence for others).


The food is below average.  High point;  the baked brie starter.  Served in a hot baking dish, accented with hazel nut oil and honey that perfumes the air.  Unctuous.  Rich.  Just good eats.  Unfortunately, the escargot is the opposite.  Tender morsels of snail dressed with hard parsley stems.  Ack.

Mains fail to deliver. A paltry two ounce, steak sandwich served with an overly reduced, sweet onion au jus.  A croque monsieur made with pressed deli ham.  Very low quality (sub USDA choice), albeit inexpensive steaks.  Frites that accompany almost every dish are terrible.  Some crisp, most soggy, rubbery, and oily.

Worth a single visit to enjoy a bottle of wine and see the fountain show.  After all, the Parisian authenticity is enhanced by the confetti of playboyesque images on cards that litter the sidewalk below and well lit mobile billboards of  scantily clad "Hot Hot Hot Ladies" crossing your view.
