htQgj-ANQpZGpIpkkrEmyQ My friends and I have been meaning to try Inspire out for awhile, and we finally were able to do so. I ordered chicken and waffles for main and their poke salmon bowl for appetizer. Since the poke bowl was only an appetizer, it was expected that it would be small, but for $13 I do not know if I'll do it again, because I have had better poke bowls elsewhere. None the less, it was still fairly well made. As for the chicken waffles, I will more than likely go back just for that. IT. WAS. SO. GOOD. Something about the spicy berry compote with the ginger maple and the waffles made me want to lick the plate. I definitely recommend this place for their chicken and waffles, my friends also got the INSP burger which looked and tasted really good too - so if I do ever come back I'll probably try different things on their menus.

If it's one thing you have to keep in mind before going it would be making reservations especially if you're a big group because it's not a huge restaurant.
