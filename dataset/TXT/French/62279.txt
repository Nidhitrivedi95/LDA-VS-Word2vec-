SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ How funny that in 2007 I wrote a Yelp review about Tricks saying it was a "perfect date place". I went back yesterday for a date and, again, nothing short of "perfect" would describe the House's performance. It was an oddly windy and blustery night last night, so the entire outdoor patio had been abandoned by the other customers who'd fled to the tables inside. The host asked us if we wanted to brave it outside and we decided to give it a shot. Since we had our pick of tables, we opted for one directly adjacent to the open-pit fire they maintain in the center of the patio. The wind was a little crazy sometimes. It was a bit cold. An occasional leaf fell into our wine glasses. But the fire kept us warm, the glow from the flames created a fairy tale-like ambiance, and the addition of leaves and twigs to our meal gave us something to laugh about. 

Add to all that a team of professional, down to earth yet very knowledgeable (ask for an opinion about the wine list) staff, plus delicious food (we shared an apricot-glazed chicken breast and tagliatelle pasta with toasted fennel goat cheese), and I honestly cannot conceive of any missing ingredients that would keep the night from being perfect.
