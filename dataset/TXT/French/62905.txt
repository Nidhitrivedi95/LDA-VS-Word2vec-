SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA Without a doubt, one if our very favorite restaurants in the Cleveland area.  Consistently good food, great wait staff, lovely surroundings.  During the summer, their back patio is a beautiful place to have a meal and enjoy friends and family.

To start, you MUST get a cheese board...one of the most affordable "luxuries" you'll find around.  You can choose from 3, 5, 7 (I think?) styles of cheese, and their fromager is always extremely knowledgeable and will help you choose cheese to your liking, or guide you to a few more adventurous choices.  Make sure to get plenty of crusty bread, you'll thank me later!

We do have some other "staple" dishes we always love to get, namely the escargot and the mussels with frites.  Their escargot is absolutely to die for!  Drenched in butter, garlic and herbs...these little beauties are delicate, slightly chewy and their sauce demands to be slurped up via dunking of the crusty bread (if I could drink this sauce straight up, I would). As for the mussels and frites, the bowl is a moat of delicous broth and again dunking your crusty bread in their while downing those gems from the sea along with a few frites and the spicy aioli makes for a heavenly dish.

L'Albatros also has a great selection of drinks and cocktails...my wife loves to experiment with new ones each time we go and has never really been disappointed.  Lastly, my daughter is a sucker for their creme brulee with its torched surface and creamy interior.

We consider this spot to be Zack Bruell's greatest restaurant in the area.  If you are looking for a great "special occasion" restaurant or even an intimate late-night stop after a show...this is your place!
