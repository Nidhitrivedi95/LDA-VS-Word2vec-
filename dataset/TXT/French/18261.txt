A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g Best macaron selection I've ever seen (20 flavors or so?) & it's BIG!  Very good price too @ $1.25 a piece.  There's also a HUGE selection of other pastries/cakes/etc.. My other favorite is the vanilla or mint merengue, pretty big in size also for only 50 cents a piece.  To my surprise, there's a dining area too although i haven't tried eating there yet, eventually I will.
