FRuuIDOd21pTJHvEGIt1Gg Duck confit, where have you been my whole life!? This place was packed Saturday night but I didn't have to wait since I sat in the bar area. The wait staff was very friendly and they are accommodating to those who are gluten free. I had the duck confit which was every bit of wonderful and my boyfriend had the veal steak with Masala sauce. He wasn't too crazy for the sauce but he said the steak was cooked perfectly and very delicious. It wasn't too expensive either.
