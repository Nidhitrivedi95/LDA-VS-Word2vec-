aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw I heard many reviews on this place. Not much of a pastry person, especially for breakfast, so didn't try that.
I came across this right after I won a few bucks on a slot machine, and thought I deserved a treat!
I grabbed a carmel macaroon... OMG!!!! Was perfect! I've never had a macaroon before, but so glad I did. Dont know what I'll do now, since I won't be able to get my fix at home... I should had bought a dozen!
