0JGMKaKJGVuDus5WcJzvjw Joe Beef and Liverpool House are universally acclaimed as some of the best restaurants in Montreal. As a foodie - I scrambled to make reservations here once I had booked my ticket to Montreal and luckily scored one for 9pm. The menu is primarily written on the walls, but is somewhat difficult to read with the dim lighting. I wish I knew what fish dish I ordered (but my French is not all that great), and it was good, but nothing spectacular. Personally, I think it was a little overhyped. Maybe next time I would order some of their all-star dishes like lobster spaghetti, instead of opting for their less-pricey (about $30 dollar) fish dish. The customer service was great, and the waitress spent a great deal of time with chatting up her tables.
