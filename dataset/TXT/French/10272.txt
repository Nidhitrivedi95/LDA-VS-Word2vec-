4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw This is one of my favorite restaurants. The view on the patio is perfect--the Bellagio fountains; but even inside is nice, like a French café. The onion soup is the best. The broth is out fabulous, and they put in the right amount of bread and cheese. The French bread is just as good, always fresh out of the oven , and their butter tastes better too for some reason. My favorite is the Steak Frites with blue cheese butter. The meat isn't a premium cut, but they serve it thin and cooked full of flavor. Their French fries are great too. The truth is, this is a great meal.
