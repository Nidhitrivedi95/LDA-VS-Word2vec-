LnSjzFXh1GrOObsRP6LhBQ First things first, this place does have great food. The breakfast pastries are well-made and delicious and their lunch items are also tasty and well-priced. I come here quite often to pick up breakfast or lunch for the office - it's close-by and quick, so I will continue visiting this place for the convenience factor. 
That being said most of my experiences have been subpar as a result of bad customer service. Some of the cashiers are just rude - I've done transactions where absolutely nothing was said by the cashier, no thank you's, NOTHING. While I made an attempt to thank the server and bid her a good day, I was completely ignored. I don't have high expectations, but a little interaction and friendliness go along way and I think it's expected in this kind of establishment. If some of the workers smiled more, and were just a bit friendlier, I'd be rating this place much higher!
