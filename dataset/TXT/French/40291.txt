KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA Ok, hands down one of the more beautiful locations to eat at located in a Vegas suburb but dam# it , I need amazing food to match the atmosphere.  

Ate gumbo soup it was so salty, blah. Had mussels they were decent. Had crab cakes, bland taste with no lump crab meat only shredded. Had escargot, not served in the shells? I thought that was a little weird, tasted as they usually do, again average. Had jambalaya it was tasty but nothing to write home about. 
Service was polite but  rather sparse. 
 
This was assessment was after driving over 30 miles from Henderson, I was starving! Anyway, maybe if I lived closer I would be a little more forgiving but its just not worth the effort for me. BTW very cool concept of picking your wine from the store for your dinner. 

I am excited about their neighbor Garfield's, got a very  good artichoke appetizer, excellent service, wish I had eaten dinner there. Will be driving back to eat at Garfield's NOT Marche Bacchus.
