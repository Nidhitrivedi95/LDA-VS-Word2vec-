HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw As always, I saw the Groupon for this place and just couldn't pass up the opportunity. We came here yesterday evening for date night. 

I ordered the filet with bleu cheese and my fella got the leg of lamb. We shared the mac n cheese and whipped potatoes. I wasn't a fan of the potatoes. They were just a little too blah. The mac n cheese were fantastic. My fella especially enjoyed the breadcrumb crust that added a nice texture and flavor. My filet was cooked well and was extremely flavorful. My fella's lamb was really great as well. After my first bite, the lamb took the lead as my favorite for the evening, but my filet made quite the comeback toward the end of the meal. Although, everything tastes better with a bottle of wine!

The restaurant is well-placed and has a nice view of the strip. Really nice for a date night or there were quite a few bachelor and bachelorette parties seated around the restaurant as well. This restaurant was definitely better than I expected.
