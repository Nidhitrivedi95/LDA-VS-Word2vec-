dubu2kN3Y9EB4uYGFWa0MQ So I'm kind of torn on this review because we stayed at the monte Carlo and the hotel and casino was horrible. We went there last night for some appetizers and drinks and it was really good however the night before we went and it was 1010 we sat in the lounge and were met by this rude older lady who literally ripped the menu out of my hands and told me that you were closed. We only return last night so that I could try the drink that comes in the steam in box and it was amazing. If you took this restaurant and put it in another casino preferably not an MGM casino then I would go back.
