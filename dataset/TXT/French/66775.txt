UpEVdq_euH-5mqCIgUAd2Q Went with my gf for our anniversary at this restaurant. Excellent decision!

The decor is beautiful - nice ambiance, upscale and romantic. The entire staff was amazing, from the person that sat us at our table to our waiter. All spoke French as a first language and the impression was really nice. 
We started with the escargots and the Papillon salad - both excellent choices. The escargots were delicious with a nice garlic butter sauce. For the main we had the New York steak et frites and the Filet Mignon. The filet mignon was one of the best I have had in a long time - amazing peppercorn sauce that had a little ting to it. Really amazed with the flavour. Washed it down with a nice French pinot noir.
For dessert we had the creme brulee and the pouding chomeur (the second one a traiditional Quebec dessert but using caramel instead of the traditional maple syrup). Still excellent.
Because it was our anniversary we got some champagne at the end. Nice touch from them.
We loved our evening. Classy place, great food, excellent staff and a great night out in town. Strong recommend!
