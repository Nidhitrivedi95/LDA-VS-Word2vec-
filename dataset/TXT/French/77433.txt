YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g We went here before they closed in Sept. (for renovation).. good thing too because the place was looking pretty tired for the price you paid for the food..... We had the 4 course tasting menu with the foie gras appetizer... 

The foie gras appetizer was amazing and the tasting menu was a good deal but next time I would order from their regular menu or the top chef menu..... 

We were going to go back and try the top chef menu but found that they were closed.  I would definitely try Hubert Keller's other restaurants.
