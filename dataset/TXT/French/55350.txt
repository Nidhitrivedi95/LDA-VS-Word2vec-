rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Bouchon gets everything right.  The cocktails are amazing (I like the Grand Cru, my husband always gets a Blood and Sand).  Service is perfect.  And the food is gorgeous.  

The steak frites are always on the menu, and they're always worth it.  There's always a nightly special, and sometimes that will call to me over the steak frites.  I haven't yet regretted anything that I've had here.  Desserts are lovely, including the off-menu (but always available) bouchons: little chocolate brownies with ice cream.  The wine list is good, and the sommelier is very good about providing recommendations that meet both your tastes and your budget.  

Bouchon is the one place that I absolutely must visit every time I'm in Vegas.
