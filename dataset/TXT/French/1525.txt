0B_aEPeZjrXs6T7vS3arrA We had a very nice overall experience at Sophie's.  My husband and I are very critical when it comes to semi-fine dining and we were pleasantly surprised.

It is a very quaint, cozy restaurant in a very strange area.  We started with Escargot and French Onion soup. The Escargot were very tasty and traditional. The French Onion soup probably should have been a bit more traditional. It was a tad sweet and could have used a bit more brothy richness. We opted for wine by the glass. Whatever white wine I first ordered was not drinkable and they quickly whisked it away and replaced it with another wine of my choosing with heavy apologies.

For our entrees, I had the scallops which were beautifully cooked, nice sauce and delish ricotta gnocchi. My husband had the duck and it was also superb and  very well cooked. 

Dessert was a bit of a disappointment. We were debating between our old standby of creme brulee and lime mousse calypso. We opted away from the safe option and went with the lime calypso. It tasted as if it had been refrigerated for a while. The lime mousse wasn't limey enough and the bread bottom was a distraction and not so tasty.

The service was impeccable. We really liked our waitress and a man who we believe was the owner stopped by at each course to see how everything was. Nice touch.  

Our only other criticism was the bread service.  It was warm which is a plus in my book but not that tasty. I think it could be easily improved. It was the right idea in that it was a warm crusty baguette but not that tasty.

Overall, we would definitely go back there. Would we crave it? Probably not but if you are looking for a solidly very good dining experience I would send you here. It was very comfortable and cozy.
