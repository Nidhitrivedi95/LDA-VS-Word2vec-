dd3GZs6zW2t7BM0cbxAzvg Party of four on a Tuesday night, and we were very pleasantly surprised. Toronto has a lot of fancy and expensive restaurants, many of which, I feel, don't deliver either a unique experience or good value. La Palette gets it right, beginning with the atmosphere. Good bistro feel, with a laid back but attentive approach to service.
We were presented with the wine list, and our server was obviously an enthusiast...she not only was able to describe the different offerings, we were welcome to try anything on the list before making a final selection. Turns out our initial choice was not as good as our second, so we were able to hone in on a winner.
The menu is varied, and carries such real bistro fare as chevalier, hare and duck.
The appetizers, Brie in a crust and snails, were a touch over done, with the brie running out and the snails a bit dry, however when we brought the snails to the server's attention, apparently it is a style of cooking you either love or you don't.
The mains, however, were fantastic.
A rack of lamb you could cut with a knife, a pressed chicken dish that made our toes curl, and black cod that was the best ever tasted. Presentation was simple but attractive, and the service the the right level of care.
We finished off with two desserts shared; the clear winner a lemon tarte that was just right in its tartness and flakiness of crust.
Dinner for two with a glass of wine each, around $100 not including tip.
Definitely on the ""go back" list, if only to see if they can knock it out of the park again with different selections.
Parking tip...just east of the restaurant, north of Queen is a municipal lot. Parking on Queen is not easy to find.
