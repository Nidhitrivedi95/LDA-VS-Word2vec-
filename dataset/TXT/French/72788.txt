XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q Holy Crap!  I think I have died and gone to food heaven!  The decor is absolutely amazing!  The tables are beautifully set with china, silver and some ribbon.  We were sat in an area of the restaurant that had its own garden.  Just the decor alone is to die for.  The service was amazing and the food even better. We did a 7-course white truffle tasting menu. It was absolutely amazing.  I am not the biggest fan of truffles and all these dishes were fantastic. I cleaned my plate on each course. It was a ton of food. You think it really isn't because it looks so small when it comes out, but after the 3rd or 4th you wonder when will it ever stop? Everything is delicious and extravagent.  I probably will not ever eat here again simply because it's extremely expensive, but I am so happy I got to experience it. It truly is a once-in-a-lifetime experience that I will never forget.
