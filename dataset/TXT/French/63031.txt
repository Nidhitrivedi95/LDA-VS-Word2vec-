SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA Good food, excellent service. A nice replacement for That Place, a staple of Bellflower for many many years.

The food was rich with sizable portions. The ambiance is classy for a college campus, but laid back compared to Table 45.

Service was impressive with delicious bread being constantly replenished on our plates and water glasses always more than 1/2 full.

While That Place will always be missed the renovations added a modern touch without trying too hard and still has the underlying feel of being hidden away from the bustle of Euclid and Mayfield.
