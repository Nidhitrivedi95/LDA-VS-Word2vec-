QEgfK_TKY8bwK-YzKDdkGw This was the second time I dined at Lumiere... after my first disappointing visit (sullen waitstaff and mediocre food), I decided to visit again for the Julia Child prix fixe March event.  The Observer provided a nice write-up and since I am fan of Julia and french cooking, my friends and I decided to make reservations.   Upon arriving at the restaurant, I was, once again, greeted with a less than pleasant hostess and when we inquired about the March prix fixe specials, we were told that the special was not for that night. However, we could order moules et frites with a glass of wine and dessert for 25.00.  Since that was not what was advertised, we expressed our disappointment. Our server said she would inquire... and of course, after a few minutes, said that they would provide an exception for just that night.   After I went home, I re-read the advertisement " Julia Child Birthday celebration during the month of March prior to 6:30.Prix Fixe three course: 35.00/per person.   Since we met the criteria per the advertisement, I decided to provide other customers with this review.  Since Charlotte has some wonderful restaurants (and a new French restaurant within walking distance of Lumiere), I will not be patronizing this establishment in the future.
