xcmmTXhuMx2fZF2Bt69F4w Brunch, lunch, or dinner, this place does it right for every meal offering.  The menu is creative and the food is delicious.  Today we went for lunch they have a great cup of soup and half of sandwich combo for $9.50.  I had my favorite, the cafe chicken and the stuffed pepper soup, both excellent.  The serve was prompt and courteous as always.  Thank for Point Brugge for consistently pleasing me!'
