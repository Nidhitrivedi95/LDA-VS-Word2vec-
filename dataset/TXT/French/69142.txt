w2tr0PA0b3tg8pId0kjM-A In the past year, I have developed a bit of a love affair with macarons. Being home for Christmas, I knew I needed to see what Pittsburgh had to offer. I tried a half dozen.

White chocolate basil: basil heavy at first, but ended up being very good

Earl grey: great flavor, but I think mine had too much gel. This is not my preferred type of macaron filling, so I was a bit sad as Earl grey is usually my favorite flavor.

Le Pittsburgh: The Bailey's really comes through. Thumbs up from me. I don't know if the cookies were done differently, but they seemed especially tasty.

Lemon: strong flavor. More tart than refreshing. Not for me.

Sugar Plum (seasonal): A beautiful purple with sugar coating. Get it if you can!

A brown one: Okay, so I ate these the day after I got them and I couldn't remember my 6th flavor. There were a few tiny pieces of nut on the cookie. This was by far my favorite though!

Prices are comparable ($1 more for 6) to what I pay regularly in Cincinnati and the sizes are the same. G+J has a lot of interesting and unique flavors to keep you coming back.
