The strangest thing was how far off the menu listings were from the dishes delivered. Why write misleading descriptions in your menu? The host admitted to us that my dish wasn't very well described in the menu. Well maybe you should fix that then. 

Service was meh. Interior was nice. Beer lost was pretty good.
