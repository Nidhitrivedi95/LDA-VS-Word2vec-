6Hj4AQ5DDGf7tsVk6LscLQ I came here for Sunday brunch with my neighbours and the restaurant was buzzing.

Sunlight streams in from the large windows, giving the restaurant an inviting ambiance. I also love that the chairs were super comfy. 

I was not all that impressed with my lemon ricotta french toast, which was accompanied with cream. For $16, I think it was a little expensive, considering it didn't come with a side (no bacon or home fries.) The portion was small, as well. On the other hand, all three ladies at the table ordered the frittata, which came with sweet potato fries and bread. They seemed to like it, but none of them raved about it. I did enjoy the lavender lemonade that I ordered, as it was very refreshing. 

Our server had a very pleasant disposition and the service we received was good. I might give this place another try.
