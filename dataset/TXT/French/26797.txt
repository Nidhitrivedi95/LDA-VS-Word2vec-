There is no material for absorbing noise, so when it is relatively full the ambient noise is extremely loud. You have to lean across the table to hear what somebody opposite you is saying.

It has an unusual menu structure, of Tapa like dishes divided into meat, cheese, and olives for one, three or five portions:  And then more substantial "plates". On this occasion we stayed with "plates".

The octopus came in a small bowl and it was soft with a very Spanish taste with lots of garlic, warm small potatoes and a pleasant slightly spicy sauce. The calamari were thinly sliced with a spicy outside and correctly cooked. The gnocchi came in a creamy sauce, were tender and again lots of garlic. The shrimp were very well presented and had a deep taste were on a bed of potato, peas, lardon and was laced with spice. The Cornish hen had crispy skin again spicy, was rich, worthwhile, hot and tasty.The lemon curd desert, came in a tiny tumbler, was rich, sharp and cool.

On this occasion the three servers, which is quite enough for such a small room, seemed more interested in talking amongst themselves than actually attending to their guests. When we arrived, there was only one other table, even so one had to get up to actually attract the attention of one of the three. As the place filled up, so the service became even slower.

The wine list is short, we had a reasonable Rioja for $55.
