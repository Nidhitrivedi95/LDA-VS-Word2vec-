m9aFZk1f8tSv248YErbpQA This is a place that I go to quite often and normally I would have given it 4-Stars. The other day I met a friend for lunch on the patio, which is dog friendly, but any dogs that I have seen there in the past have been on the ground or under the table. On this day, a young woman comes in with her dog (who has a tutu on)
and she is carrying the dog's bed with her.  She plops the dog's bed down on a chair next to me and puts the dog in it. She sat there taking picture after picture of her pooch.  I was not a happy person.  Maricopa County has a law that all pets that are in a restaurant, must be on the ground, not in a chair or in the patron's lap.  I was very surprised, that no one from the restaurant said anything to her.  If we had not been ready to leave, I would have said something to the owners.
