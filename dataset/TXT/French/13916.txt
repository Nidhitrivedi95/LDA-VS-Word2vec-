50-xiTYmE6NERi-yJ6NvHw First off...for being $1/oyster (after 4pm), I couldn't get enough.  They were so fresh and delicious.  One dozen wasn't enough.  The pig's ears...eh.  The escargot were delicious.  The chicken liver pate was fantastic. The rabbit entree was average.  The cocktails were delicious.  And the service was great.  Yes, I consumed a lot that night...but it was so delicious!
