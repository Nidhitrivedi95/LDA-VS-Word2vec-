HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw alas, since my first meal here in Oct 2010, kitchen staff has changed and gone are the details which made this a formidable lunch bistro in the french style. BOO.

#CROQUE MADAME
see my pic of the most spectacular Croque Madame I've had in my life. it was here, back in Oct 2010. 
unfortunately, the Dec 2012 version is too eggy, not enough ham, boring bechamel and missing the frisee and vinaigrette which balanced this dish and made it so delightful to photograph and look at.

#BEEF TARTARE
I won't even bother with ground beef tartare anymore. it's a preference. a strong one.

#AYCD BLOODY MARY
Great price for all-you-can-drink bloody mary, but it's so goddam spicy that i can barely get the first one down. And this is from the guy who sprinkles ghost chili flakes on my fried chicken.

#DECOR
like the harsh presentation of food, the restaurant lacks the balance of soft touches and color. mounted cold white plates and orangey-brown liquid in metronomically placed-in-a-row comme-ca-monogrammed wine bottles just don't cut it.

!VIEW
The windows give you full view of Las Vegas Blvd traffic just below you, and to the north the faux Eiffel. [shaking head... you just can't get away from it, either here or in Paris itself  :P  ]

not for lack of wanting to revisit comme ca; it's just that i'm rarely in vegas on a friday, sat or sun for lunch.
true to french lunch hours, you cannot get in before noon.
