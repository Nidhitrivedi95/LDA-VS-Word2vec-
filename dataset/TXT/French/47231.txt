O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q Every time I come to Vegas and stay at the Palazzo, I come here at least once.  So the 4 star review here revolves around three things:  The morning crafted Bloody Mary's, the Beignets, and the service.  If it weren't this overwhelming desire to continue being a functional human being during the daylight hours and not become a poster child for AA, I'd have their crafted Bloody Mary's fed intravenously.  Because they have such excellent service, I'm sure they'd accommodate it.  It's Vegas after all...

The food you say?  Good, not exceptional.  Even while writing this, I'm having a hard time remembering, other than the Beignets, what the hell I did eat there.
