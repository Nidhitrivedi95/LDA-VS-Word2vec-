JvEu_1sJod6DGbYOatFvMQ Keeping wine cool in a see-through clear reusable plastic gift bag? I thought at first when they brought it over that we had won a prize or that one of us was getting a gift and I got all excited!!! Then I realized that it was a bag with ice in it to keep our wine cold ha. Kind of disappointing and it seemed to modern and a bit tacky in such a nice restaurant. 

We also had some of the slowest service ever. Granted they were busy and we were lucky to get a table, but we had to fight for attention a little bit here. Good thing I eventually got my french onion soup!!! It was pretty much exactly what I wanted in every way. So props to them on that. 

I also split their warm goat cheese salad and that goat cheese melted on top of that piece of toasted bread laid nicely on those greens was so so so good. But how can you go wrong with melted cheese??? You can't really. The rest of the salad was just so so though. And all in all, for the price, I wish I had gotten a little more food, or at least a free refill of the free plantain chips they started us out with!!
