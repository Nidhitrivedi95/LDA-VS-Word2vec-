LdD0yYLcHuamULrvZYY3Jg Wound up here completely by accident.  I can honestly say it's the greatest accident I've ever had.  Intimate atmosphere but lively, great service (didn't hold not speaking French against us) and the food was out of this world.  I would have paid double and still been happy.  Simply amazing.  It's byob so make sure to bring some wine! The foie gras is not to be missed.
