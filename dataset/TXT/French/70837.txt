xBxDMEkFK5GBhiy-8gGE9w We got into town after a day of driving from Toronto and wanted to eat somewhere not too far from our hotel. On a lovely fall Friday evening there wasn't a wait and we decided to try Brasserie t. We weren't disappointed. The service was top notch and just the right amount of solicitation.  The location was also awesome since the recent spotlight art installation had been installed across the street for Le Parterre in the Quartier des spectacles. We started with the pan seared fois gras and wow - having both never had it before it was divine! My boyfriend had the Coquille St. Jacques which was a tasty seafood dish sitting in a small pile of mashed potatoes and baked in a shell - the shell was sitting on salt which was neat. I had the Pork ribs which were very tasty. All in all a great meal in a great town.
