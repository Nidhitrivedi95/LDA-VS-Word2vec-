aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw Bouchon Bakery is a MUST for me whenever I'm in Vegas.  I love the pistachio macarons and will get one (and a box) whenever I am there.  They are a little bit pricey but worth every nibble.  I've tried all of the flavors but pistachio is really the best.  The bakery is located on the casino level of the Venetian underneath a set of escalators.
