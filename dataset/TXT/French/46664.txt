nkHaix6KenApS8M-liZsCQ Just writing reconfirm the excellence of the waitstaff and menu.  The menu is varied enough to encompass diners not as familiar with traditional French cuisine but does not stray too far from the path for traditionalists.  This is one of the few restaurants where the named Chef is in nearly every night ensuring quality control and consistency.  Chef Gross cares deeply about his suppliers and the training of staff.  The attention to detail shows.  For those in need of a private party, the restaurant works with you to craft the menu and personalize the event so that your guests are left wowed by the experience.  I do not hesitate to bring my most discerning of business guests here.  For less formal needs the bar area is cozy and perfect for a get together with close friends.
