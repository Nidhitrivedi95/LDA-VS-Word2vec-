YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g Convenient in Mandalay Bay. Made reservations but we probably didn't need them. The food was good except the sliders definitely aren't an item to order. The sliders would have been more suited to an Applebee's then a higher caliber restaurant and the amount charged for them. As you can tell I didn't like the sliders. The other food was good. The service was excellent. The waiter was personable and attentive.
