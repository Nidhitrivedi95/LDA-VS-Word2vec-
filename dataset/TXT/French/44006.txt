The gorgeous french atmosphere and beautiful food is an experience in itself. The hot food includes: scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, fried chicken and waffles, pancakes, french toast, carving station, salmon wellington, made-to-order omelettes and eggs benedict-which are both brought to your table, so no waiting around. There is also a cold food section with various salads like beet and goat cheese, sweet pea, quinoa, roasted vegetables, quiche and fresh seafood including crab claws, shrimp and calamari.   Save room for dessert! French macarons, creme brûlée, lemon meringue pie, tiramisu, mini cinnamon donuts, mini caramel apples, cake pops...just to name a few! The desserts are truly small works of art. The service is excellent ; servers are attentive and clear every plate and cutlery after each round. Overall, if you appreciate good food, presentation and atmosphere, you will adore Colette!
