YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g Food was exceptional and the prices are even reasonable, but the bartender, Jason, was a complete d'bag whose behavior borderlined criminal, which is hard obviously to look past. The experience was so bad that my friend and I walked out and walked over to Strip Steak which was terrific in every way.

I've since sent a letter with everyone associated with the place talking about my experience - which I've always dreamed of doing, but never actually done before. Felt good just writing it. I sincerely hope Jason gets fired.
