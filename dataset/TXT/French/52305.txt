Pw2ti1aFvhECxTEeQOrbeQ We were staying for a week in a nearby hotel while house-hunting in Edinburgh.  Le Marche Francais was practically across the street.  They were not open the first 3 days we were there (end of New Year's holiday), with no sign to indicate when they would open.

That lack of information is the only reason I'm not rating this 4 stars.  The food was wonderful and very fresh.  Oh how I love a ham baguette and this delivered, in addition to the other treats we enjoyed.  

This will be a favorite stop after we move to Edinburgh next month.
