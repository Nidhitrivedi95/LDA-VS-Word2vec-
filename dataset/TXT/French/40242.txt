KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA My fiancé and I went here for brunch one Sunday. The location was absolutely beautiful, we sat outside on the patio which had fans and misters that kept us cool. The view we had was of the lake, we got to watch swans swim by and paddle boats. It didn't feel like Las Vegas at all! 
I ordered the $20 endless Kir Royales to enjoy while we soaked in the beautiful setting. I ordered the Bacchus Omelet which was stuffed with goat cheese, spinach, tomato, mushrooms, ham, and braised leeks served with a side of breakfast potatoes. Everything was very tasty. The omelet was simple but all the flavors went well together. Overall a very pleasant and enjoyable brunching experience. My only critique was my bottomless drink sat empty for about five minutes.
