L6RxkP8dneVGelDLUhjCug I moved here in February and have been searching the Vegas area for the best pho and bahn mi in. I think I found one here at So Good Cafe. The bahn mi sandwich was crispy and fresh. Just enough spread of the sauce. Pho broth was amazing. I could've eaten the  pho just the way it was made if I didn't feel like adding more spices and herbs to it. Definitely coming back here.
