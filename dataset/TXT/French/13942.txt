50-xiTYmE6NERi-yJ6NvHw Came here for Summerlicious $35 dinner with two friends. We sat inside and I love the French bistro décor (sat near the bar) - very comfortable and cozy yet classy and great place for quiet conversation. 

Service was ok but I found that the server interrupted a few times. Quite awkward as I was in the middle of a conversation with my friend... Usually they would pause and get your attention before asking a question?? 

The bread to start was fresh and warm, but really tough to chew! I was scared I would lose a tooth. 

Salmon Tartare -  I liked this and it was great paired with the thin, slightly bitter endive - something different than pairing with toasts. The mayo was good too. There was a lot of thin carrot ribbons.

Beef Steak Diane - nice charred crust but it was not as rare as I wanted for a medium rare. While it was tender, it was also quite fiberous/difficult to cut and could be more juicy. I liked the mushrooms, green beans and potatoes. 

Un Bordel de Fraises - essentially strawberries and whipped cream, this was a nice sweet & sour combination. Very simple pairing of strawberries, rhubarb, light Chantilly and meringue bits. (But the spoon was a bit big for the jar)

Also shared half a dozen of buck a shuck oysters. They were a BC variety, too fishy for my taste. 

Overall the dishes were very standard yet well executed.
