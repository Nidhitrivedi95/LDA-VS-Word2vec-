rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw Truly incredible experience from beginning to end. Our sommelier was friendly and very knowledgeable and eager to help us choose the wine that would best accompany our taste buds as well as the entire meal we had planned. The food was amazing. There are a few other comparable French restaurants in the Las Vegas area that I usually frequent when in town (out of courtesy I'll refrain from naming names) but this was my first visit to Bardot and it is hands down the best dining experience I've ever had in Las Vegas. The food was exquisite and everything was cooked perfectly. I tried a little bit of everything but the highlights worth noting (at least for me) were the foie gras parfait, the duck wings a l'orange, the mac and cheese (yeah you heard me right) and the chickpea fries with ratatouille and eggplant purée. Everything was perfect. I'm not very good at describing good food in text, but this was amazing and you have to try it for yourself.
