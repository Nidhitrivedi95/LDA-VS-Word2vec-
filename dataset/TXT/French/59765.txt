S5gtq6g6dIfyaFvyPYyzkg 5 stars for the BEAUTIFUL Christmas decorations! Totally got us in the mood for the holiday season! 

3 stars for service- it was nice, but sloowwwwww. Our waitress actually forgot to bring the tea for our "afternoon tea"... Though, I was perfectly happy with my champagne, but still... 

4 stars for the delicious afternoon tea spread: smoked salmon & cream cheese, roast beef & horseradish, egg salad-my fav, and ham & mustard sandwiches, scones with jam and clotted or whipped cream, and cutesy little cakes and macarons on the top! Yum! It was so much and so filling, we couldn't even think about having dinner. 

If you're thinking about a great holiday tea with your family or with the ladies, the dome is the best!
