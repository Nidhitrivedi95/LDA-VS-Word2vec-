FRuuIDOd21pTJHvEGIt1Gg Great food, amazing brunch. My issue there is noise level. Service is very quick, very well located. Easy to find parking on the week-end. They fresh fruits are also very tasty and well chosen (sweet) you won't have the impression of eating fruits that don't have any taste and were picked too early, if you know what I mean...
