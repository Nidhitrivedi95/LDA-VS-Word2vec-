The owner and her employee were nice and tried their best to accommodate the large crowd, but service suffered. We were there forever. Not sure why only 2 people were working on Mother's Day. 
Main cons:
The coffee was really poor and the girl looked confused when we asked for sweetener. I basically spent 4 bucks on a latte I didn't drink. Also she said she had almond milk but told me when she brought my drink that they didn't have any left. She made it instead with coconut milk without asking me. Whatever. 
Next, to be blunt.....
The food just wasn't good. I was surprised since the owner is French and seemed to have some other decent reviews. I had the Sophie, my husband had the crepe of the month and my son ordered a sweet crepe with Nutella. 
My crepe was a buckwheat batter and dry. I knew it was going to be buckwheat but expected a soft fluffy texture with cheesy oozing toppings. The cheese was not melted and the veggies lacked flavor. 
My husbands pears were not mascerated in anything and they had no flavor so the Gorgonzola was very unbalanced. All salt no sweet. 
My son had a sweet crepe -hard to go wrong with Nutella, but it wasn't as good as expected either. 
Aside from the food, the sweet young girl employee was wearing thongs,as in flip
Flops. Just not appropriate in a kitchen/cafe. Cheapens the place. 
Sooo, not sure what to think. Hard when people have a nice concept, but no knowledge of the restaurant or hospitality industry to run a business. 
Would've been less stars if they weren't friendly. Sorry ladies, we tried.
