YUFxSG6idHePsxOmnSHtpQ We love Mimi's, don't get me wrong but a few months ago they changed their menu.  I honestly miss the old menu!
But if I could ask one thing of them, it would be PLEASE BRING BACK THE OLD CHICKEN POT PIE! the new recipe is totally different to me, different crust, different filling (old style was creamy and thick, new style is runny and tastes like gravy) and half the size....oh dear!
I've been a longtime patron, and the chicken pot pie was my comfort food standby. I have to find somewhere else that does up the chicken potpie right....Unless Mimi's goes back to the old recipe!  
IF IT AIN'T BROKE DON'T GO FIXIN IT!!! : )
