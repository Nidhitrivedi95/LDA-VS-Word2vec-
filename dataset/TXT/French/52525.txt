q0n4I-zqiI47xispOqc1lA Caffe Mona you snuck up on me!  I was searching for a place to grab brunch and stumbled upon this place.  I didn't know where it came from, but apparently my friend pointed out that it used to be J'eet.  

It's really very homey inside.  I love the wood accents and casual feel.  What drew me in was a promise of fabulous french toast.  That promise was kept thankfully!  I love a good prix fixed menu and for $13.99 you can get three courses of breakfast goodness!  

First course was a fruit dish.  It was actually a plate full of apples, pears and watermelon.  Way bigger than I thought and fresh to boot.  The second course I choose the fig, apple and brie french toast.  The fig was baked into a large slice of french toast while the brie was melted on top adorned with a couple thinly sliced pieces of apple.  It was incredibly tasty and had a plentiful amount of fig!  

If the air issue is cleared up I'd happily hunker myself down here for a afternoon work sesh.  They offer free wifi and we even had a dude sitting next to us with his laptop out, so I feel like they're welcome to workers.  

The last course was an apricot preserve on a crepe.  The apricot was so so good!  It's definitely something you're not going to get everywhere.  I may have thought it was a lot of bread if they hadn't served that huge plate of fruit, so thanks for not making me feel guilty Caffe Mona!

The one complaint is that it was hot as Hades inside.  Like the oven's been on all day and we don't have a strong enough air conditioner/don't have one on at all hot.  It was pretty uncomfortable so good thing the food was a win or I may have been outta there by the first course!  As long as they get that under control I'd return.  

Looks like they're welcoming to workers considering they offer free wifi and we were sitting right next to a busy little worker bee next to us.  So pump that air and I'll spend the day ordering up some delish food and have a nice little work day!
