jA3xcba82t8x06H8NzG4VQ Is the food good?  It's very good.  Not "zomg transcendent," but very, very good.

Um, why did you only give them one star?  It took more than an hour to get our appetizers.  The whole meal was two and a half hours.  For two courses.  It was insane.  And it was not crowded.

Anything else?  It took a hysterically long time to get our drinks.  Which was perplexing.  Our tab probably would have been more than double if we could have gotten drinks within 10-15 minutes of ordering them.

So just speed?  Tangentially, it was a bit crazy the server could not recommend a wine for us.  It's not a large wine list, and that is kind of the server's job (or to be able to grab someone who can help).

Might be cool to sit at the bar and order something, and maybe they're faster on the weekend, but you should avoid the regular seating during the week.
