The french bread that they serve is very fresh and tasty.  I tried the warm olives and warm brie with honey as appetizers and was very happy with both.  For my entree, I ordered one of the specials they were offering, Duck L' Orange with mac and cheese.  This duck was amazing!  We paired our dinner with a pinot noir that definitely fit the bill.  The service was top-notch.  I would definitely try this place again.
