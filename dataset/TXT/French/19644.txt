aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw It's so not fair how good this place is.  Resting outside the gates of the Phantom theater, and below an escalator, this small bakery stand offers the most delightful baked goods I've even had.  The croissants here are the best ever.  Crispy shell, flaky and moist buttery middle.  They can become the ultimate addiction.

The cheese danish, blueberry, corn, banana nut muffins are just out of this world.  If you're on a non-carb diet, I dare you to try and bypass the endless goodies this stand has to offer.  You'll be depriving yourself of sheer ecstasy.
