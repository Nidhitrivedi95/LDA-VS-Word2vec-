OYHpqY6-3C-wXR-uPbHhwA Nice little quaint bakery/restaurant.  Everything on the menu looked and tasted great.  My steak and over easy eggs were cooked perfectly.  The baked goods looked really tasty, but we were so full from our breakfast since we added a side of red velvet pancakes.  One thing to know, the inside seating area isn't really designed for a party of 6 or more... maybe for outside.
