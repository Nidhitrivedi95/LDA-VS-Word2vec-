A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g 5 stars for the quiche.  negative 5 for the staff.  Best quiche Lorraine ever.  Be prepared, it's creamy, like eat with a spoon creamy, but delicious and delectable.  Only odd thing here, the staff is miserable.  I've never seen such unhappy people in a group setting.  I asked about ingredients for the macaroons and you'd have thought I asked someone to give me a kidney!  It was a tremendous effort to get a question answered.  My son can't eat citric acid, which is often an additive in foods, and the woman I asked about it actually said, "you're not going to make me call the owner are you?  Just try it, and if you don't like it I'll give you back half your money."      WHAT?   We'd already had the quiche for breakfast so let it go, but who the heck speaks like that?  Always happy to give credit where it is due, but staff like that should be called out.   Also, if someone is allergic to something, you don't "try it" to see if it's "okay".  What's going on behind the scenes there?  Weird.
