4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I had a birthday brunch here and it was to die for.  The service was incredible.  The restaurant itself was like a scene straight out of France, I guess you couldn't expect anything less, right?  It is just exquisite how they decorated and placed everything so strategically.  They really put in effort to pay extreme attention to detail.  Everything tasted delicious, I had a strawberry French toast-the greatest!!  I was very pleased with my experience.
