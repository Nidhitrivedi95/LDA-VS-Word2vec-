8ciT6qjI18x9EPtOb-gqYQ Ohh la la! This place made me want to learn French. I went there with my bro and sis- in laws as well as my mother in law and my husband. We each brought in our own bottle of wine. I love BYOBs because you can really splurge on your food AND drink delicious wines. This place did the trick! We had the Interested Cheeses (my sis-in-law and I love cheese) and the Filet Mignon taco for starters. I can't vouch for the tacos, but I think my husband would have fought me for it. 

For our entrees I had the salmon which was cooked to perfection! I even ended up eating off other plates with salmon after they were full I loved it so much! My husband loved the Filet Mignon as well. I do think it was here where he discovered he really did like salmon. 

Of course, we had to have dessert, too! We got the chocolate mocha and the four berry tartes. Even if you are full, get a tarte to go! 

I really want to go back to try the farfalle..Maybe this weekend??

I guess it is good for groups but call ahead. Its a tight squeeze!
