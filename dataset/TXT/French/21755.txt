Bf-yMQiSmDZyqfGyFKQ0bA My coworker and I were in Pittsburgh for a conference and were searching for an authentic, local restaurant to soak in the Pittsburgh scene (this was our first time traveling to this city!) We landed on this gatropub and really enjoyed our experience! The food was adventurous and delicious and the tap list was impressive. Our Sunday dinner experience was the same night as a Steelers home game, so the atmosphere was quiet, but it generally looked like a fun atmosphere to watch a game!

I would highly recommend the onion jam and feta on toasted baguettes!
