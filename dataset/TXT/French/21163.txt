B56AYe5GNuavMDtwFsXqzA Petite Maison has nice French food at a decent price. Great hors d'oeuvres. I like Rillettes de saumon, steak tartare, and croque Monsieur. Desserts are excellent. Tarte Tatin is my favorite! I've never had Creme brulee au chocolat there but my dad says it's really good too. Go try it, you won't be disappointed!
