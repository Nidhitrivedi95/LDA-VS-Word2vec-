2gUbgbdJ7IFSbicBXlSchw i looooooved this place. went in a big group and got wonderful service. i was very hungry and worried the portions would be mega-french style aka tiny portions. i was proven wrong!! really worth the prices here. 
i highly recommend the burrata salad. DELISH. i didn't love the lobster risotto but my partner didn't. the steak frites was also wonderful. 
one star off for me asking the waiter a recommendation for dessert and getting the apple tart - which was gross. no one at our table even touched it. they still charged us for it. oh well.
