XcWlBj5oQgzKhR7Cxovj3w I am a frequent flyer and have found that is getting rare to find a good place to grab a bite before a flight, this place included. I had the burger and it was over cooked dripping with grease.  The frittes that came with it work half undercooked and half crunchy straws. My server came by only three times; once to take my order, once to grab my credit card and lastly to drop it off. I came at a slow time where I watched the servers gather to talk and not take care of their customers. Such a disappointment.
