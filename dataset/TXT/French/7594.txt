4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Omgggg after coming here  I wish I could have crepes for breakfast everyday!! Got three different types and two of them were specials...one was better than the next! Also had a duck Benedict which was outrageous! 5 stars for food and if I could give 6 stars for service I would! A must have for breakfast on the strip!
