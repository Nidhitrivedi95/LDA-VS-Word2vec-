t1mR_Zff6Dqv1TueE2JLEA Had heard so many great things about this place, so had to check it out. I bought a deal for 4 people from travelzoo and was VERY dissappointed to find that the restaurant was charging us additionally for some things that were not part of the voucher. The person who greeted us was rude, asked us what time our reservation was for (knowing that we were 15 mins late). He seated us, and our moderately friendly server took over. He went over the additional charged quickly, without giving us a second to ask questions. He didn't explain the menu properly either. I feel like we were being treated poorly because we were "voucher customers". 
Most items on the menu had additional charges.
Overall, very dissappointing experience. Food is way overpriced for the quality and the service.
