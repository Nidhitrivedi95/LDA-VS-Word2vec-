33Tr0eRki1Yamzleu4GMdw Simply the best french cafe in Las Vegas! Delicious recipes from Jonathan and Nicolas!! BTW, they are the nicest people. I looooove their apple pie with vanila whip cream, things like that keeping me coming back. Today I had the chevre chaud salad (warm goat cheese), deliciously healthy! I highly recommend Rosallie to all my friends and all who came are very satisfied. Prices are great also! Me and my husband had entree, coffee and desert for $25. Thank you Jonathan for your great food and ambience!
