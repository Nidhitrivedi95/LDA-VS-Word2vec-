hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA Who knew you could get the best flaky croissant with really friendly service in Vegas in the middle of an office park? Liked the food so much, got a chocolate twist, quiche, panini sandwich and apricot cheesecake thing to go too! Come early because it gets busy right at 11:30 for the lunch-rush.
