ytD9rJ-jcb8zMUCfiYCnFw I'm a breakfast person.  So Cafe Cherrier was one of the more memorable places I patronized in Montreal.  It's open for lunch and dinner too.  (I can just imagine the people hanging out on the restaurant patio drinking wine and beer on a nice weather day.)  I had their smoked salmon crepe with white sauce for breakfast. Dee-licious! ...And I am not an egg person.  The orange juice is freshly squeezed and the coffee is fabulous which is a big plus...just enough flavor but without the bitter aftertaste that goes with overroasted beans.  The portions are enough for a hearty breakfast with out being too much.  The decor is sleek diner and you can sit at the bar and eat if there isn't a table available...which is where it seems the locals eat.  The prices for breakfast don't break the bank and most come in under $10/plate.
