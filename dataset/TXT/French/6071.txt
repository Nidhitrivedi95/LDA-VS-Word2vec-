3s46-PMxoEIa7kUj0VrlXg I've been to this restaurant a few times. First, let's start with the building itself, semi-modern, raised and somewhat modern... however all of that is ruined by the BAR and the music coming from it! 

The food is really good, someone must be cracking the whip behind the scenes because unlike other places I've eaten in the quality of the food does not drop during the off-peak days like Monday/Tuesday etc.

Service? -- It depends who you get. I got one bad server who was fishing for tips and thinking that I was a a bad tipper, hovered around other tables. We (my girlfriend and I) had to wait around for bread! 

However - The tall man with glasses is a GREAT waiter! He really makes you feel special and makes sure that you have what you need. He also asks if you want bread right after taking your order. 

Overall a pretty good experience except for 2 of the servers. 

The Salads and Hamburgers are what I recommend.
