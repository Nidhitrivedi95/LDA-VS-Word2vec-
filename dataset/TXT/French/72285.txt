XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q I've had a few really wonderful meals, but this tops my list.  My husband planned a wonderful surprise trip to Vegas for Valentines Day and included the most memorable meal so far.  Every sense is stimulated.. I know I sound like a food snob, but the decor, ambiance, service and not to mention the16 course meal is perfect.  The service really is impecable and the breads are heavenly.  We particularly loved the gruyere brioche.  The amuse bouch was the only thing that I didn't love.  The 4th or 5th course was a Robuchon specialty of langostine ravioli with a fois gras reduction which was too die for.  My husband loved and the waygu beef course, I believe his exact words were " I don't know if I've ever tasted anything before".  It was expensive, $1100 after tax and tip for 2 but worth every penny.
