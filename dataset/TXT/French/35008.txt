HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw a french bistro is judged on his pomme frites and ours were soggy and not all that hot either....service was ok - how hard is it to serve the lady first in a party of two? pot de creme was yummy but caramel tart was not good.....on the plus side, the decor is nice and the mushroom risotto was delicious.....not sure i would go back when Mon Ami is right across the street
