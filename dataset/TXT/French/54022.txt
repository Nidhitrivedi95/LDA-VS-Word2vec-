qrSsS0pk7SL67MP5nN8tlg This restaurant is best known for its onion soup.  It is one of the best in town not only is it not salty, the bread and cheese is so good that mix well with the soup.  The cheese is not sticky at all.  The Le paté du chef I am not a fan but others enjoy it very much.

The Poached filet of sole looks very well cooked.  Last time I have it is very salty.  The Frog's legs sauteed with tomatoes concasse, garlic and herbs I see people are eating them yummy.  The Deboned roast duckling flambeed with grand marnier in orange sauce very different from the Chinese Peking duck. For the Roast rack of lamb rubbed with dijon mustard and seasoned with herbs provencale, the taste and the marinated lamb is good but the texture of the meat can be better.  If the raw material is not supreme, not matter how well it is cooked, it won't earn the 5 stars.

The dessert Crème burlee is very disappointed.  Except the torched sugar top layer, the custard is not fresh.  It used to be very good
