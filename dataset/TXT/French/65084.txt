Tl2nqtPXlLbAG3qkUYVM2g My friend had a Groupon ready to expire and was awesome enough to share it with me.  I've lived here all my life and always thought of Vincent's as a place our grandparents would all hang out at.  The decor looks like it, but that's ok.  It's a French restaurant and definitely not geared toward yup's.  The food and service were still fantastic.
We started with the foie gras and duck tamales.  Duck tamales at a French restaurant seemed a little strange on the menu; so we were intrigued to order.  They tasted like duck tamales.  They were good.  The foie gras was awesome.  We were also brought the most delicious croissants I have ever had.
For our main courses, I had the lamb and my friend had the wild boar.  My lamb was fantastic and came with yummy potatoes and green beans.  The wild boar was good.  If you are curious what while boar tastes like; it tastes like pork.  Lamb is one of my favorite meats and this was definitely one of my favorite times eating lamb.  
We finished off with desserts.  I ordered the profiteroles and my friend had a grand marnier souffle.  You really only need to order one dessert per four people.  They are large.  The profiteroles were tasty and very rich.  I couldn't come close to finishing them.  The souffle was actually two souffles.  I've never had a souffle before so can not really say if it was a good souffle or not.  It tasted like eggs.  My friend said they are supposed to.  The chef brought us out complimentary flour less chocolate cake.  That was delicious.  It would have been amazing with some vanilla ice cream on top.
The food was amazing and I will definitely be back when in the mood for some French cuisine or even just for some wine and desserts.  I would recommend as a great place to take your mom for her birthday too.
