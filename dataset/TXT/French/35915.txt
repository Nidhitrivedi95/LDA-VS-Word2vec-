hvjgF-vnPw2jyL5DBuB0qg Probably the best meal of my life. Obviously the raw bar is a must but the entree was definitely the highlight. Roasted quail w/ foie gras, fiddle heads, morels, caramelized leeks & jus. Incredibly rich but not excessively so. Coffee cake w/ salted caramel brittle and malt ice cream, which of course tasted like frozen Ovaltine, absolutely brilliant. I do want to say that Chuck Hughes is probably the least pretentious celebrity chef on the planet. He was there when we arrived and spent the whole time washing dishes. Probably thought that was the best way he could help and he knew his team had the food handled.

Bravo
