4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw My mom and I made reservations same day got the patio and everything from there was amazing. I got the filet mignon and it was cooked to perfection. even the mashed potatoes were amazing. Of course its vegas and can get pretty crazy during dining hours. But everything was right on time and we in and out. Definitely a place i'll always stop at when in vegas. Our waiter was also helpful and accommodating.
