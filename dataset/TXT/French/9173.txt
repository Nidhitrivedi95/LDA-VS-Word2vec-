4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw It's a good thing we made reservations!  This place was packed on a Sunday brunch.  The place we were sitting had a view of the Bellagio water show.  What a way to wake up.

The food was excellent.  I got to try their crab cakes. Although the crab was good, the salad that goes with it was excellent.  Now, I could have had the crepes, which are great, but I was in the mood for frites, which is like a combination of a french fry and chips.  Basically, I think they cut the potato in to thin slice french fry shapes.  Then they do a quick fry to it.

Anyway, I ordered the fish and chips.  Now, normally when you think fish and chips, you think of getting five or six fish pieces,  like chicken tender shapes and all.  But not this place.  They give you a whole fillet of fish that is wrapped with panko bread and fried.  The fillet was at least a foot long.  That is a lot of fish!

With some champagne on the side, this was a great brunch and a great way to say goodbye to sin city.
