T4g4k2OhCTsiqcP-ZXElHQ Went there for lunch, it was a pleasant atmosphere - a little bit crowded but the noise level was comfortable for conversations (not too quiet that everyone can hear you nor too loud that you have to shout).

What stood out to me was the food arrived pretty quickly compared to other sit-down restaurants, which was much appreciated during lunch hour. Service was good and fast. They give you a jar of water to refill yourself, and were prompt to give you another jar when you're running low.

I ordered the Ratatouille / Goat Cheese quiche, I must say it is one of the best quiches I've had in a while. Not too cheesy or heavy, lots of taste, just delicious. I will admit that their fries are nothing special.

The creme brulee was perfect - not too sweet and very smooth. The only reason it didn't get a 5 star is because the desserts (in my opinion) cost a little too much (the creme brulee was $8). The rest of the menu was fine, my quiche was $16, their sandwiches were $12 and other entrees were around $16 to $19.
