A lovely experience overall. Went and ordered:
- foie gras appetizer
- polenta (main #1)
- pasta special

All the food was great. You could tell it had been prepared with great care and came out piping hot.

The service was also fantastic. The server was extremely helpful in selecting a wine, and providing recommendations on the menu. We didn't feel pressured at all during the meal to hurry up or order more AKA increase the bill amount.

THE BOTTOM LINE: wonderful food, and equally as wonderful service.
