in3zjiaLpNzr9G3K35gAJQ This review is for the farmers market.  I was thrilled to meet a friend here for coffee and crepes.  I loved the outdoor environment with options to shop, eat and relax.  The ambiance reminded me of time I've spent in France.  In my opinion, I believe this setting is the closest you can get to being in France in AZ.  I was impressed with the variety of food options at the market including paella, crepes, omelettes and pastries.  It is an intimate setting, so be prepared to share a table and meet new people if it is crowded.  I think this part reminded me of France as well.  :)  I will definitely be back!
