Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA Husband and I went to Mix on our first night in Vegas. The restaurant looked nice, very open. Our waiter, Randy, was very pleasant. We started with the potato gnocchi with mushrooms for the appetizer...omg, so good!! Highly recommend this. Not a lot of people mention the bread baskets in reviews and I get that, it's just bread. But at mix they give you like three different types all very good, we ate the whole basket. For my entree I had the Roasted free range chicken and my husband had the pepper crusted filet mignon with the mash potatoes and asparagus. Yes, I ordered chicken. But hey I like chicken and when it's made to perfection like Mix has managed to do...it's fabulous. My husband liked his steak but said he's had better (we've had steak all over Vegas). He loved the asparagus and the potatoes as did I. Bottom line, this place has great food.
