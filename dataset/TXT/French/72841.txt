XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q While the food is great, I can't justify the $420 bill for two people. I have had meals on an equal caliber for half the price ( playground, napa rose etc). service was outstanding.  

This was our second time back and while it was good, I think it'll be our last only because there are so many places in Vegas to try with so little time. 

My black cod was delicious however I enjoy my black cod at Roy's Hawaiian fusion is better and only $40

For a comparable price range +$200 per person, I greatly prefer e by Jose andres (see my other review).  the food there is more creative, tastes better, is an overall, better dining experience.  more food too.
