cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg My second time to Au Pied de Cochon and by far one  of my favourite restuarants in Montreal.  In fact, it might be one of my favourite restaurants of all time.  You have to make sure you make your reservations early.  I made mine a few months in advance.

In a nutshell there is amazing Fois Gras and amazing Cochon, which is pig by the way.  My partner and I started with the Fois Gras appetizer which was the special.  Essentially it was Fois with cheese, blueberries and Sugar Shack maple syrup.  Probably the best thing I've ever had to eat.

I'll let my pictures do the talking but I highly suggest you make a reservation here.
