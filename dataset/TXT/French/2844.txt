Amuse Bouche: Potato leek soup with croquette.  Smooth and delicious.
Alaskan Crab Salad:  Great citrus and sweet flavors.  Micro greens was a good contrast to those flavors.
Foie Gras: I missed this since the ban in California so it was nice to enjoy one of my favorite foods.  Didn't care much for the slithers of almonds for the crunchy texture.  Rhubarb sauce was a good acidic sour note to balance the fatty richness of the tender juicy foie gras.
U-10 Dayboat scallops: potato mousseline, gravy.  Yummy.
Lamb loin: cooked perfectly.  Less gamey than the usual lamb flavors.  Good or bad depending on what you like.  I don't mind either way.  I guess when it was less gamey, you forget for second it is lamb.

Great service and ambiance.

Wine guy was very enthusiastic and excited about the wines he presented.  I learned a lot from him.

Food was just good.  Maybe I was more in the mood for comfort food but everything was fine.

I lost my muffin gift box at Marquee Nightclub...
