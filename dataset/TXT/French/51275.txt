P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ Very good.
Very expensive like every other French restaurant.
I liked the carts for breads and desserts.

At first I thought the food won't be sufficient but there were enough complementary items which were delicious. There were some surprise dishes also.

$150 tasting menu is enough.
Don't order anything extra. We ordered a soup and felt it's too much.
