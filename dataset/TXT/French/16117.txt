78TC3sZSYBzBsSJ0z5pyhw Good food. I am still laughing at one of the other reviews for this place saying that the italian food here is horrible.

I split a chicken dish and it was very good. I don't remember what it was called though, just that it was one of the specialties. 

I had to ask for a breadbasket. -1 star
My drink was never refilled and it wasn't even busy -1 star
