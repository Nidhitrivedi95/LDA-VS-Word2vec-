2g7BfzamlNGPP6jMZrt8kw I can't comment on the food and only on the service and drinks. We stopped by here late for dessert and cocktail since we had already ate dinner somewhere else. The restaurant is attached to Le St-Martin Hotel Particulier. They weren't busy and we were seated right away outside. We ordered Pink Sangria and some sort of dessert. The sangria was super sweet and tasted more like pink lemonade with not much alcohol, should have returned it for a glass of wine instead since it wasn't a cheap cocktail. The dessert was very good though and our server was very nice. The saying stands true, if a place with indoor/outdoor seating isn't busy on a Friday night well it must not be very good.
