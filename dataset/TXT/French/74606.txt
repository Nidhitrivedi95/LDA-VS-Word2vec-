xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g We made reservations for the night of our 10th anniversary.  We were having dinner elsewhere and decided it would be wonderful to do dessert and champagne here with the great view.  We were contacted asking if we could come sooner to get a window table and were delighted. We rearranged our plans to make it work.  We arrived early and upon being seated noticed no desserts in the main menu and advised our waiter we only needed a dessert and drink menus. At this point the maitre d came over to inform us we could only have a table of we were each purchasing an entrée.  Nowhere on open table does it state this, which we explained, but we were given an unconvincing perfunctory apology and asked again if we would like entrées.  I'm easy going....you can have whatever rules you want.....but you need to make sure they are explained when you allow sites to set reservations.  Also, I counted 9 tables 4 window and 5 non window) THAT WERE EMPTY!!!  You really embarrassed us and lost out on what would have been a quick table turnover to keep an extra empty table?  Unbelievable.
