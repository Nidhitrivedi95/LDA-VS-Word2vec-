bzbNGyrTwWHAgg1CqkSgeg Went there about 3 years ago and it was awesome! Back this weekend and it was Dennys on an smaller location and with higher prices. Service was bad. Empty glasses and dishes were never picked. Zero attention to detail and food quality and taste were not what we remembered from our first visit.
