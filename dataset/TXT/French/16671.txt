8ciT6qjI18x9EPtOb-gqYQ Really cozy restaurant. Definitely need to make a reservation in advance and you can do it online through OpenTable or something similar. There is a Total Wine fairly close by so we stopped there right before since the place is BYOB. We ordered the onion tarte; delicious and classically French. The onions weren't overly powerful and were sweet. I ordered a fish dish with rice and tomatoes - very simple, but delicious. My husband ordered the filet; just a touch too salty but really tender and flavorful. And the best part, the dessert! We ordered a pear crumble dessert and it melted in our mouths. One of the best desserts I've ever had. Definitely a splurge, but worth it! The service was first-class.
