ufwkkMd9yr9cFU1R5ONArg Love this spot! We always try to get there early as there are no reservations, but we haven't had an issue getting in. The space is small but comfortable. They are open most holidays too, so it is a great breakfast option on a day when you don't want to cook. But call ahead to be sure they are open!

Their grapefruit juice goes down good, and they have 2 choices of coffee, a medium and a dark roast.

I've only had the huevos rancheros with the chorizo added on top, but that is all I ever want!
