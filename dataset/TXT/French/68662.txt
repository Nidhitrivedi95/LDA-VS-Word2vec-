VmSkQsAjUtzJeliKeGQCOQ This is a very small joint and not a fancy place. But their food and service is excellent. The portion are big and for a very affordable price. They only open till 3pm. So no dinner service. 

I came here on my day off with my husband. I ordered the seafood omelette. And my hubby ordered the grilled fish.

Their menu changes every time. So I can't remember the name of each dish.

Hubby also ordered a Golden Beet Soup. It was really good. And there was a touch of goat cheese with went well with the soup. 

My seafood omelette was delish. There was even a whole slab of salmon in the centre. The roasted potatoes were divine. Nice semi crisp shell wrapped with a delicate pocket of potato fluff, with you chew it in your mouth. There was also a white melon that was so sweet and crunchy on the side. 

My hubby also enjoyed his meal a lot. The golden beet salad with his grilled fish was delish as well. 

Definitely would come back for breakkie or brunch. Hope they have dinner service again later on.
