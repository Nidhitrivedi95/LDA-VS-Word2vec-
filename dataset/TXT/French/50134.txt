ovtlrcsVRlgZZQUlHs_ovw Back again last night.  We frequently go to this restaurant as that good is fantastic, employees are always happy and knowledgeable, and the chef is outstanding.  One member of our party tried the scallops special with a lobster sauce which she rated as a ten out if ten. Vogue steaks were great as always and the flat bread appetizer was terrific.  Be sure to make reservations especially during winter visitor times.
