ZdaZwXC0FByDY3EwNELphw My boyfriend and I both ordered ribs and they were AMAZING. Fantastic explosions of exquisite seasoning brought the wonderful flavours of the ribs and greens directly to our taste buds. IMO the fries were not good at all, but hopefully Union go for something other than the string cut fries someday.

In any case, the atmosphere was very intimate and comfortable, the wait staff were super nice, the location is awesome. Had a great overall experience. Can't wait to go back!
