0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g Beautiful restaurant with seating right in front of the Bellagio Fountains.  Amazing service that definitely Michelin Star worthy (do they still have those in Vegas).  My favorite coarse was the lobster salad, tasted very fresh with big chunks of lobster.  Surprisingly I liked it more than the seared foie.  I had high hopes for the foie since you can't get it in California and someone had told me they liked it better than the foie they had in France.  It was good (is foie ever bad?), but  my favorite preparation is still Gary Danko's.  All of the other dishes were solid, in fact I can't think of any that I didn't like.  The service was superb, very attentive.  As were were walking to our seats, nearly ever waiter we passed welcomed us to the restaurant.  Great evening, definitely made the night special!
