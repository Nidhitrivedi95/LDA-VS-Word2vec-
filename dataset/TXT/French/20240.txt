atNpoWy_XrhT9EUIEP6azg Sick of the same old thing for breakfast? Then you need to head here. Go now. Do not waste another minute (unless it's evening, then go to bed now so you can get up early tomorrow). 

I took a friend that was visiting from out of town here on a whim as it looked cute to her when we drove past (and didn't have a line). I was not disappointed. We were seated right away in a lovely area outside. The style and decor of the restaurant is gorgeous. The women's restroom was stunning. The staff was also accommodating.

I started off with a fabulous mimosa-esqe concoction that completely hit the spot. Our food came out in a flash. In fact, it was before I'd even finished my first mimosa. 

I had ordered bananas foster french toast. That sounds good doesn't it? Let me tell you it was simply heavenly. The presentation was exquisite and it wasn't so rich that I couldn't eat it. It was also the perfect breakfast portion (just enough that you can finish it because leftover breakfast doesn't always turn out well). I have never had such an amazing order of french toast in my life. I left still craving more.

This is truly a diamond in the rough breakfast spot.
