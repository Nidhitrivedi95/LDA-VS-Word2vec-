IUtjbbqQ6jUSi4t2jjgYRA My first visit here and I was impressed with quality food, decent menu selection, well organized and efficient staff and friendly/competent service and respectable wait times at  prime time. The atmosphere is hospitable and comfortable, certainly not pretentious or modern and customers are a variety people all ages who appreciate decent quality. I found some of the egg food items a little expensive but acceptable. Breakfast for two with juice and small desert at $55 incl tax/tip.. The meals were quite delicious and most everything well made on premises. Recomended if this fits your budget.
