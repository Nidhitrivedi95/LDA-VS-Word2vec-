Cheese tray had great variety, Caesar with calamari was wonderful (but hold the croutons), veal very flavorful and the accompanying potatoes had great flavor and texture.  We asked out waitress to pair our wine, and she did a super job.  Topped it off with strawberry tart....the basil cream was perfect.  Of course, my husband said he would only have one bite...yeah, right, more like he ate half!  Oh, and the French press decaf....the perfect ending.  Ok, it is our fav Charlotte restaurant for many reasons...flavors, service atmosphere.
