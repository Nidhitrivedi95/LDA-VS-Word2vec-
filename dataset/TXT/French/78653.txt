ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug Service wasn't horrible, but I admit a bit slow. Definitely caused wonderment for all the people waiting in line when the place was clearly half (or more than half) empty.  

Came here for dinner the first night because it was convenient, as in out the room, straight down and across the elevators.  Service was extremely slow...I said we were ready to order to the man who brought us water, and he said we had to wait for our server, who showed up a while later. Also had to ask for bread as it didn't arrive and we were starving. It was biscuit (buttery, pretty good) and standard white. At one point, a roll from a basket ready to be delivered to another table fell off the tray and rolled past us...with much ado. It was still there when we left.

I had the seared ahi tuna salad with roasted garlic, olives, tomatoes, potatoes and crispy cheesebread. No greens to a 'salad', but it was tasty. Friend ordered a steak which he finished. 

We actually ended up there at 1 am the morning of the day we left. Got a fruit plate which had raspberries, mini blueberries, sliced pineapple, thin watermelon, grapes, and halved strawberries. The teapot had a hole in it so the hot water poured on the table as it also filled our cups. The best thing about the plate was the banana nut bread.
