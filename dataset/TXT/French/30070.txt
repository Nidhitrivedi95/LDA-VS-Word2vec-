frMGezDOAMWnsBTno2WziA Pleasant staff who are accommodating and welcome you with smiles (rude companies, take note). We tried the eggs benedict with chicken and one of the dessert crepes and their grilled cheese. All good! The eggs in the eggs benedict crepe were cooked and not runny, which is a win in my book. I especially like those PC pop drinks they have. Unique flavours like watermelon and mint etc. Highly recommended.
