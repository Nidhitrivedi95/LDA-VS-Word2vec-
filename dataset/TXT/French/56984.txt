rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I absolutely loved Bouchon on the first visit, and it may be one of my favorite Las Vegas food spots from my last few trips. A restaurant tucked within the gorgeous Venetian hotel, everyone visiting Las Vegas needs to put this on their LV food destination list. The food, the atmosphere, the service was beyond delightful. If going for brunch, plan to sit outside in the garden patio of the hotel. The patio is nicely shaded so it's very comfortable despite the intense LV heat.

For brunch, I opted for the Oeufs Benedict, 
two eggs poached with Hobb's smoked pork loin on an English muffin, topped with Hollandaise sauce and mixed greens alongside some cocktails. My bf had the brunch special of smoked chicken apple sausage and two eggs, potato, and toast in warm skillet. They serve complimentary bread with amazing butter and jam. To share, we had a dozen of the east and west coast oysters and at the end for dessert, we had the raspberry filled Biegnets, which are jam filled sugar coated doughnuts. The eggs benedict is wonderful, and the eggs were perfectly poached. I enjoyed our cocktails, especially the French 75 and their bloody mary. My bf really enjoyed his dish and drinks as well. The oysters were all great, very clean and fresh. The beignets are an absolute must. I'm not one for sweets, but these were some spectacular beignets. Our waiter was very good at being conversational and helpful with our orders. Absolutely no complaints on service and food here. The wonderful ambience is also something to note.

I can only speak highly about my first and hopefully not last visit to Bouchon. Overall, we had such a great time here. I almost forgot I was in LV because of how isolated and tucked away the restaurant is from all the activity outside. Definitely consider for brunch and sit in the outside garden patio. My friend has also strongly recommended their dinner, so I may plan for that on my next visit if a trip to LV is in the stars.
