el-3IdlW3bTCSnquLvH-3w Stopped in for lunch today, I got the French onion soup which was served bubbling hot, fresh out of the oven and it was delicious.  Also tried the chicken breast sandwich with bacon and pesto served with a side salad.  Everything was fresh and very tasty but the absolute best thing was the dessert!  I had the strawberry banana nutella crepe and it was to die for!  This is a charming and cozy place with excellent and friendly service so don't miss out!  Prices are very reasonable too.
