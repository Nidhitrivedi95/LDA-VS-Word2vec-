4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw After dining at this restaurant I'm perplexed by how anyone can give it less than 5 stars. We had dinner here on a gorgeous Saturday around 5pm. We were seated outside right along the strip. The weather was perfect and we were enjoying the people watching and the Bellagio's water shows.

The staff was on point, hustling around tending to the patrons needs and wants. We shared a couple bottles of wine. I ordered the pork medallions wrapped in bacon. Hello? Pork wrapped in pork! How can you go wrong? My medallions were complemented with the accompaniment of what I'm going to say was a quince and yellow raisin chutney. My cousin had ordered the cheese plate which came with some fresh crisp apple slices, raisin bread, walnuts, dates and a fig spread. I tasted the cheese and all three were fantastic. 

I also liked the vibe in the indoor dinning rooms of this establishment. Mon Ami is definitely getting added to my list of great  places for a casual yet memorable meal in Vegas.
