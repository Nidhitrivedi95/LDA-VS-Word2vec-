O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q My wife and I went here for lunch today and I would recommend everyone that lives in Vegas, or visits Vegas to try this place.  We had a charteurie as an app, then the Orecchiette and the croque-monsieur.  It was all fantastic.  Great sausage flavor in the pasta!!  I definitely need to come back for a steak and wine.  They have a giant selection of wine and from what I've heard the steaks are perfect.
