WOd8tWsh2Yt_osHv-ngx_w This restaurant has one of the most respectable and professional staff I have ever seen! They make southern hospitality look weak. They know how to make a mean breakfast. I grabbed the sampler because I wanted to try everything. I can tell you this, it's worth every dollar. Highly recommended. It will be a place I without question will return when I am back in Montreal.
