4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Great atmosphere IF you sit outside or the sun room. The indoor dining was so dark and cold.
The coffee was bitter or old we had to return it.
The eggs Benedict was amazing. They must use grass fed butter. Holy moly! 
The French toast was made out of magic bread! I couldn't wrap my head around it. Amazing !
