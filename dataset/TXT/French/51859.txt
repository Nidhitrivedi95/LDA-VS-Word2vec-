pmoIMK8zGWvKsVOPDBYfzg If you can get beyond the price, Andre's is a very nice high-end restaurant. But if you factor in price, I was disappointed in Andre's. It did offer a tasting flight of cognac that my wife wanted. It also gave her a very good plate of scallops. I had the salmon which wasn't bad but I've actually made better myself at home. It was completely underwhelming. The wait staff was attentive but a little pushy. For the price, I'd have been happier going elsewhere.

I will likely be back because my wife enjoyed the experience and I don't mind spending a little extra when in Vegas. But I will order something other than the salmon.
