I recommend sitting out on the balcony area.  You have a nice view of the strip, including the Bellagio fountain shows across the street.  The food is delicious.  The bread was amazing, and I had the mussels which were perfectly cooked and flavored.  There are plenty of wines to choose from, and it's worth it to splurge here for dinner during your Vegas vacation.
