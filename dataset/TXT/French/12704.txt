4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Based on my sister's recommendation and reviews in general this was on my list of must try places.  We have 2 Mon Ami's in our area that my sister says pales in comparison to this one.  My husband and I arrived around 10:15 for a late breakfast and decided we wanted patio seating.  It was a 15-20 minute wait, no big deal.  Immediate seating if you wanted to sit in the main dining room (while quaint was quite dark).  

I had the Market Berry Waffle and it was delicious.  Seriously the best waffle I've ever had.  Crispy outside and fluffy on the inside just like the menu states.  I'm convinced they deep fry it to get that kind of crisp.  My husband had the eggs benedict which were equally delicious.  They make their own English Muffins and you can definitely tell the difference.  Our service was wonderful.

Highly recommend sitting in the patio area.  It was completely shaded when we went so very comfortable temperature wise.  The people watching while eating is great!
