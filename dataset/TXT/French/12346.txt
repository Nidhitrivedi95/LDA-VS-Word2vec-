4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw The ambiance is wonderful, the wine selection is great, although I miss the wine cart, and the food, well the food is amazing.   Went for our anniversary just because we wanted some place special and this restaurant certainly is.  Not very often that lamb is an entree but it was the nightly special and of course I had to order it.  Done perfectly and the side was an artichoke puree that made my mouth sing.   Hubby had a steak and fries and I think he might have licked the plate.  The salad is a bit lack luster, just some lettuce with dressing, but who cares, I didn't eat it all and was able to find room in my tummy for all of my main course.  Always sad when I don't have room for dessert.
