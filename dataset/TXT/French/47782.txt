O3OH5IEFMPtz7mPKakPZ3Q I've never left a restaurant review where I had the opportunity to eat so many different items in one sitting (I ate ten!)

Japaneiro was amazing!

I wasn't sure what Japanese fusion was until today and now I hope that it makes its way to my hometown soon. 

As I mentioned (and not necessarily proud to publicize), I ate a bunch. My personal recommendations are the Gyoza, the Black Cod Lettuce Wraps, the Beef Tacos, the Salmon Ceviche and the Rock Shrimp. 

I look forward to coming back to Vegas for each and every one of these!
