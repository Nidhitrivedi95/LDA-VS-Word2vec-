Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA The service here was not that impressive. We walked in shortly before the champagne  toast and explored a bit since some had not been here before. Lots of employees were around and no on said hi or welcome. That's ok, but not what is expected. The server was busy with other tables which is ok but then once we ordered we got things we didn't order and had to send it back with the person delivering, and this happened twice. During the champagne toast, no one was coming to have any and the guy was giving us grief about asking to try both of the drinks. when the bill came, they added on things that weren't ours and we finally had to cancel an order that never came but yet they left a check for us to pay for it. Love the view but not the service
