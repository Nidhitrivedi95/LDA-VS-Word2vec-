QeFsIMcIFIJcOrpthYL8jg Lovely atmosphere, ambience, live jazz, very dim lights all those great things. The only thing missing was a real flame in our candle (we got a tea light). 

Our server was really cool and friendly, effortlessly so, unlike some servers who try really hard to be cool but aren't, she was truly cool, but not too cool. Great service. 

Food was fantastic. If you love lamb as much as I do. The lamb is the buzz at this restaurant. Too bad I could only afford the lamb poutine. The rack of lamb is 39 dollars I wish I could've tried it. 

My girlfriend had spaghetti and meatballs  The pasta was delicious, al dente (it had bite!). And the meatballs were monstrous. It was courteous of her to ask how many she wanted. I mean huge. Baseballs of meat. They were really delicious baseballs of meat!
