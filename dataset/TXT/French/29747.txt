fFInb4Dl2Ix4iE-VOltbkQ We went at Verses on a Sunday morning and tried the brunch menu. The atmosphere is good and the place is well located in the old port. Service was very good, and very friendly staff which I enjoyed. The wine list is great but can be expensive. However the food was just ok, even disappointing, it looked as it had been reheated. The food quality and presentation was just average, looked what you could expect in a snack-bar.
