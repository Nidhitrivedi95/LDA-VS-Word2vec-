UpEVdq_euH-5mqCIgUAd2Q I'm not a fan of eating onions but I had a taste of my friends French onion soup and it was to die for. I would definitely order this if I ever went back to Le Papillon on Front. Problem is, I probably won't go back. I found the entrées to be overpriced for such mediocre tasting food. I ordered the New York Steak Frites which was cooked med-rare (what I had ordered) but it had a burnt taste to it. I also tried a bite of my friends Florentine crepes which I thought tasted bland.

The service and the décor of the restaurant give this place points but the food won't be bringing me back.
