4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Ate here in March and love it. This was not our first time and won't be our last.  This is a "must eat" on almost every Vegas trip we make.

The ambience is great - inside, wonderful dark wood, comfortable. There is also outside patio seating, so you have a view of the Bellagio fountains and the Strip.

Food - just simply amazing. The trout - awesome!  I had the seared scallops over a bed of pureed califlower and spinch and it was so good.  My DH who does not like scallops, loved them. He had the steak (flat iron I think) and liked it, but regreted not ordering the trout.  They have a duck confit dish that is wonderful as well.

There wine is reasonably priced and so good.  The bread - amazing. Service great.  I reallyl can't say anything bad - the prices are reasonable too.
