oJZNHz5UUVUgrZwVBVlpYw This bar is about as classy as it gets. It may seem cheesy that there is a man playing love songs on a grand piano, but a couple of Cable Cars in, the piano melodies almost become hypnotic. This bar is famous for their Cable Cars, a spiced rum cocktail served with a cinnamon/sugar rimmed martini glass. They also make a fantastic Scooby Shot. I am not sure what they do, but it tastes almost like a tropical milkshake...creamy and delicious. If you want to snack, the smoked salmon and caviar plate is out of this world good. OUT. OF. THIS. WORLD, i said!
