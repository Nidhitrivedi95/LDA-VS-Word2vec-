4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I came here three times! I loved the place, with the traditional and consistence food. I took away one star, because the service for me was spotty. (The hosts at the front aren't too polite, whether you have reservations or not. Some waiter were more attentive than others.) The cooking is always to perfection, but the flavoring can be a little bit more bold. Slightly on the expensive side, but it is worth the experience and food.

1st time: Breakfast

Lemon Pancake - For me this pancake was slightly denser and dryer than I would like. The flavor was very vanilla and hint of lemon (not too lemon-y, which I prefer, but if you like the lemon flavor to hit you hard; this is not for you.)

Smoked Salmon Benedict - I loved this plate! The English muffin was crisp, buttery, and light. The smoked salmon was generous, egg yolk was just the right consistency (runny), and the hollandaise sauce was amazing!  

2nd time: Lunch

Lemon Salmon - Both the salmon and vegetable was cooked to perfection, but slightly bland on the flavor profile.

3rd time: Dinner

Filet Mignon Merlot - Cooked to perfection (asked for Medium) and the red wine sauce was delicious. 

Mussels Martiniere - Wow, the broth had such a deep flavor, the white wine, sea, and butter! 

Creme Brulee - So delicious, it was very vanilla like and lite custard (doesn't taste like eggy cake). One of the best, I tried.
