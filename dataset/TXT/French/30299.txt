FRuuIDOd21pTJHvEGIt1Gg As Lisa N points out, the Foie Gras with gingerbread was executed well.  Unfortunately, any sous chef should be able to execute this dish and the pairing is practically a standard.  

The warm potato and octopus salad was meh.  Tender octopus was muted by an ocean of mustard sauce.

The meal went downhill from there.

For main courses we ordered the Lobster ravioli and the Roasted Scallops.

The ravioli were edible though they tasted as though they were purchased from a distributor rather than made fresh.

The scallops were a complete disaster.  Listed on the menu as "
Roasted scallops, saffron sauce, leek "confits", spinach" they were served wrapped in bacon.  While that's not a crime in and of itself, it is problematic when patrons may not eat pork products and that is not listed on the menu.

We're not helpless or zealots - so we cut the bacon off and began to eat but the scallops were cooked past well done and rubbery.  We left the plate practically untouched.

For dessert we ordered the fruit salad with sherbert and the runny butterscotch cake in order to hedge our bets and I'm glad we did.

The cake was fine if not good but the fruit salad was a disgrace to chefs everywhere.

A plate of day old cut fruit replete with the juice that had leaked out of them as they died a slow death.  The plating was that of a school cafeteria - slopped on the plate.  If one eats with their eyes first, my eyes were disgusted.

I would not recommend this place, nor trust the opinions of those who do.
