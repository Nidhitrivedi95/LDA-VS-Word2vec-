rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A OK, so the food is actually 3 stars.  But I had the best dining experience of my life at this place.  I met a waiter the night before at a bar at Luxor, I think.  He then invited me and my 10 cousins to dine at Bouchon the next evening in a private room.  Apparently, Lebron James ate in this room the night before.  I then received hands down the best service I could ever imagine at a restaurant.  We had over 4 servers, a tour of the kitchen, a gift bag with baked goods, and over 20 desserts served to us.  It was amazing.  The desserts were 5 stars, the canape was 5 stars, but my steak was 3 stars.  The canape was 3 squares of watermelon crusted with spices served with a caramel soy glaze.  Yum.  I'll never forget those, they were out of this world.
