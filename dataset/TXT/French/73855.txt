xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g Came here for birthday celebratory dinner. This would be my second time being here. The service was amazing specially that I didn't have reservations. We got nice seating that overlooked the Bellagio fountains. The waiter was great and always took care of the drinks and always asked to see how everything was. We had escargots to start, they were ok, I mean they were escargots. We had a steak and rack of lamb. It was delicious. We had effeil affair drinks and they had blue berries and raspberries. So delicious. For dessert we had the chocolate soufflé and it was amazing. You can never go wrong with this place. Also the entrance is through the kitchen which is really cool.
