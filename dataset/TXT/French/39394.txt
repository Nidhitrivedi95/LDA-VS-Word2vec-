jSfnItqaOnEp2nenVF7fCg Our first experience at Amuse was great.  We had the most amazing dinner and our waiter was fantastic.  Our second experience, however, was very unpleasant.  We took some of our friends who are from out of town, but just recently bought a second home here.  The food was not as good and the service was horrific.  The waitress even had the nerve to say that  she and the staff were betting in the kitchen on who was going to eat the bread at our table.  She said that our friends were more fit than my husband and I because we ate the bread and they didn't??  Well, our friend just lost 30 pounds because he just had heart surgery and our other friend just doesn't eat that much -- very tiny lucky gal.  I could not believe how rude and insulting the waitress was though.  We will not be going back!  So disappointed.  I thought this would be our new place, but the inconsistency is a real turn off.
