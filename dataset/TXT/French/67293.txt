uTCOEqjuVAXUOzti5TWj2Q WOW OH MY! These crepe's were fabulous! 

The combined feel of simplicity and french cuisine is the perfect way to describe The Crepe Club. Whether you are looking for a flavorful, innovative sandwich or a that perfect afternoon delight, The Crepe Club is your one stop shop.

Oh and don't get me started on those juices....B-E-E-TIFUL! This is the perfect "on-the-go" option for everyone living the fast-paced life in AZ.

Last but not least, the coffee at The Crepe Club is the perfect taste of Arizona as it is crafted locally and brewed to perfection. Yummy!

Overall, two thumbs up, five stars, and satisfied tastebuds. Will recommend to all my friends and family to stop into this AMAZING establishment.
