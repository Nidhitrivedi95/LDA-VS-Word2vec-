It was a Tuesday night and the place had only a few tables occupied and as I wasn't in the mood for table service, I opted for the bar.

The wait and bar staff were all buzzing around..........except they were not buzzing around the customers.  There were multiple instances that the bar staff and wait staff gossiped about everything which was unprofessional - but considering the average wait staff aged looked to be barely out of the 20's I'll give them a break this time.
It took a while to get drinks....we had to ask for water......but we did get our order of a meat and cheese plate and an order of Crab & Lobster crepes.

The chesses and meat plates in this town continue to be small portioned and a bit disappointing......Vivace is the only game in town where you get a nice amount of everything.....Cafe Monte...take note.  The one plus is that they serve a VERY inexpensive breakfast during the week.

The main dish, which was shared between me and my GF was good...very rich.  All and all it was a good experience until the I was handed the bill which was fair pricing wise and had it returned to me with a larger around of over $10?  I asked the waiter and he had swiped my card for another larger bill.  He corrected the problem, but handed me the corrected charge slip that required a signature..but only one copy...the copy for the store....meaning if the correction didn't go through right I would have been screwed...so I had to ask him for my own copy.  

So in closing, taking away the factor of either inexperience or just plain non-paying attention wait and bar staff, Café Monte is a cute little café in South Park worth checking out.......if you have the same issues I did.......then one time might be enough *grin*.
