jSfnItqaOnEp2nenVF7fCg I hired AB to cater a private event in my home and I actually had guests follow the servers throughout the party...my guests couldn't resist snatching up more tasty morsels (even though there was PLENTY of food to go around)!!!!  Amazing catering. Truly.  I've tried other caterers and they were good, but not AB great.  Professionals!  Food is amazing!!!  
I've also attended social events where AB was the caterer. They were able to pull it off amazingly well with such a large crowd.  Quiche is exquisite!  
Most recently, I had the opportunity to try their version of tacos at the Arizona Taco Festival at the Salt River Fields and, BY FAR, they were the BEST tacos (but those are not on the restaurant menu...just saying...these chefs are versatile!!!) 
Since moving to East Phoenix, I still make the trek for myself and for any out-of-state visitors of mine because I know they need to try this special place.  This place is that good.  If it is high season (winter) please do not expect immediate seating or seating at all.  This is a quaint bistro that many many many people love.  If it is a special occasion, call ahead and make reservations!
