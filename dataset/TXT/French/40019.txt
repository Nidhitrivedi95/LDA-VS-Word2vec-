K67pkQljTFTW_P-7xUQrFw I am so surprised at all the negative reviews. This is a place we have been known to queue up in the snow to eat at. It is always on our itinerary when we visit Montreal. A trip up there without dining at L'academie would feel incomplete. I have never had a bad meal here. I usually get one or another variety of the moules et frites. I'm a big fan of the curry ones but most of the ones I've tried have been fab. The penne a' la vodka is delicious too as are the grilled langoustines. The restaurant is BYOB and there's an SAQ conveniently right across the street. I much prefer to come here during lunch. It's a little cheaper, you avoid the crazy dinner queue, and it's less manic. Plus I love to sit by an open window on a sunny afternoon and enjoy my meal.
