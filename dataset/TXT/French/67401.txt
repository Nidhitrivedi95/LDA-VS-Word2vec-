UWupVhvb1qWZh8rNowJliQ The Manhattan's  are delicious. Made with honey and a local rye whiskey. The steak tartar was above average - hand made chips with a quail egg. Could have used more lemon and seasoning though. The scallops were cooked to perfection and the corn salsa was amazing. Steak was exceptional and the duck was to die for. Everything local!!! The staff were well trained but inexperienced. A little attitude from one of the young ladies didn't put me off though. The dessert was the highlight of this meal. Order the pavlova and the turnovers. You will not be disappointed. This restaurant features Chef Bruce Woods along with a couple investors. They created a nice ambiance in a great location. Staff informed me Bruce is no longer a part of the kitchen as of days ago (March 17/2014). His wife, the pastry chef is on maternity leave. The food is still good but who knows for how long. I recommend this restaurant for the desserts alone. They were truly incredible.
