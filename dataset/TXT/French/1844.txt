0JGMKaKJGVuDus5WcJzvjw I wanted to love this place so much. A coworker had recommended this place to me and originally I wasn't able to get a reservation a week in advance online. However when I called, they were able to squeeze us in for dinner at 5 and I was STOKED. Maybe I overhyped myself for it too much but we were all left a  little disappointed. My sister ordered the lobster spaghetti without the bacon because she is pescatarian. The spaghetti was good but it wasn't the best spaghetti I've ever had.. perhaps it was the lack of bacon that made the difference? We also ordered a steak dish that was a bit lackluster. The highlights of the meal were definitely the appetizers of scallops, eel nuggets, and eggplant but the entrees were a little disappointing.
