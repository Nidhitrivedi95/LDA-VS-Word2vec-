An_U8woQkFVsMqVblkImZQ Such a good place! I went here 2 days before they closed down permanently. Really sad because this place is so beautiful, and their dessert are over the top although it's a bit pricey. Their food wasn't too bad either, i love their omelette. I was talking with the patron, if they are going to open in the other location, they said not in the near future. Hope they're going to open up again!
