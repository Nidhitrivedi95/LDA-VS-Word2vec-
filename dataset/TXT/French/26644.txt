D87tFO-R6U8f4-e0r4Zq_g I went to Crepes a GoGo years ago when it was at its old location on Bedford and tonight I made the mistake of going there for an evening with a couple of girlfriends.  I have been to many restaurants and it has been a long time since I have had service that was this bad.  The situation was actually so bizarre that I cannot help but laugh as I write this.

Beware of unadvertised extra charges!  We split two crepes among three people and when we asked for cutlery our server told us that there would be a $1 charge and that she could not cut the crepe for us.  It was a bizarre way to start the meal, but it was $1 so we went along with it.  Now, let me remind you that we were three people so when she only returned with one set of cutlery, we were a bit confused but asked for another set.  The crepes were fairly good (I would have given three stars), but the service was a major negative.

When the bill came and we inquired about the $3 "miscellaneous" charge, the owner came over to our table and that's when things became interesting.  Apparently, she likes to yell.  After listening to her go on about "the service industry", how her "bills are tight" and how "if other people saw us sharing, they would all want to share", I could not help but wonder what on earth had happened to this quaint little creperie.  Judging by the scared looking employees behind the counter, things have been rough since they changed locations.  Hmm....  Maybe Yorkville is not for everyone.
