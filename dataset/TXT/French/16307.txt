I made my reservation almost a month in advance and was greeted warmly at the door by Benjamin, the awesome host that night. For starters, we had the yellowfin tuna tataki which was mouthwatering and amazing. My dinner partner had the foie gras which he said was the best he has ever had and I had what was easily the world's best crab cake: it was flaky, tender and had not even a speck of grease anywhere near it.  For mains my dinner partner had the veal and I had the sea bass which was done perfectly. 

I adore the ambiance here: right on a quaint Plateau corner, small, unassuming, perfect lighting, cool tiles and even though it's loud, it's not so loud that you have to scream to your table mate in order to be heard. We will most definitely be back to QG.
