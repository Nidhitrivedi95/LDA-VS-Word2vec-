I've been to both the New York and the Las Vegas locations, and I feel like the New York location has a little bit better selection and a much nicer atmosphere overlooking Central Park. The one in Vegas is pretty much a grab n' go kind of place with no seating area. It's right near the elevators to the guest rooms at the Venetian though, so it's really convenient if you're staying in the Venetian tower and just want to make a quick trip down the elevators to get some coffee/pastries.
