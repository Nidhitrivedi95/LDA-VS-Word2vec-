u_-PMjrCpr9EBRmLSWCEHQ Absolutely my new favorite spot on the way to Montreal! We stopped by over the summer after reading about it and the place was one of the busiest restaurants I've ever seen so we unfortunately didn't have reservations. Luckily, we went back this weekend on a pretty slow day and finally got to experience the location. We mostly went in for a flight but also had a delicious cheese plate, and it was great. We were so lucky Richard, the manager, was there and he even gave us a tour and history of the restaurant, and was so wonderful and friendly. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone, make a reservation in advance and enjoy a great place with a gorgeous view!
