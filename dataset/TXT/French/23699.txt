cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg Montreal is definitely a foodie town.

Au Pied de Cochon is definitely the epitome of foodie.

As soon as my wife and I decided that we would be going to Montreal for a few days I was immediately on the phone securing a reservation here.  I was very fortunate to score a 7pm reservation for a Sunday night.

First off I want to note that all of our servers were extremely friendly and helpful.  Also, they work their butts off!

Now to the food....

We began with 2 cromesquis foie gras.  A mouthful of warm fried foie gras really set the tone for the entire meal.

At the same time we shared a charcuterie platter that was out of this world fantastic.  

Next, I had ordered the tomato tarte (which I had read online about) and my wife ordered a daily special salad.  Unfortunately, she didn't quite hear the explanation of the salad by our French accented waiter.  The Salade Croustillant had some delicious pieces of pig along with a fried delicacy on top that was stuffed with various parts of the pig such as bone marrow.  We quickly did a switch and enjoyed both dishes immensely.

Our last savory courses were the infamous poutine foie gras and the PDC mixed plate which consisted of the best blood sausage that I have ever eaten along with another type of sausage, some pulled pork and a large amount of very buttery mashed potato.  Everything was phenomenal.

We somehow managed to share a slice of lemon meringue pie for dessert.

Despite the richness, and the cost, it is the type of place that I would have gladly returned to during our short visit.  Instead it will be a place to revisit.
