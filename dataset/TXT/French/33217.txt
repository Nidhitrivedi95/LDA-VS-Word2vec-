HiMb8cwGsnFVwYxt1h0RCg I am obsessed with this little bistro! My family and I are currently on vacation in Montréal, and we were looking for a place to eat French food for dinner tonight, so we decided to try Bistro Tôt ou Tard because of the pretty high ratings and the variety of the menu and because French food is one of my absolute favorites. When we first walked in, the place looked a little empty and slow (this is because it's more popular in the mornings for their brunch), but we were greeted "Bonsoir!" by a nice waitress who showed us to a booth. 
My family and I ordered a veal with linguini dish, a steak with rice & vegetables dish, a grilled trout with rice & vegetables dish, and a penne pasta dish with mushrooms and shallots. Two of these dishes were on the specials menu at just $3 or $4 more, so they each came with soup (we got a creamy vegetable soup and a tomato chickpea soup with cilantro), a dessert, and either coffee or tea. The food was SO GOOD, I didn't want to stop eating! Also, the portions were plentiful and the presentation of the meals was so pretty! For dessert, we had a créme brûlée and a chocolate mousse cake, which were both delicious and both small and light enough to eat after our meals.
The waitresses here were so kind and helpful (thank goodness they knew English), especially since everything on the menu was in French and we were barely getting by with my beginner level French. Service was good, prices weren't too high, and I've decided we have to come back again before leaving Montréal because this place makes me happy and makes me feel like I'm in France! Je t'aime, Bistro Tôt ou Tard!
