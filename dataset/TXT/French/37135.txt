ITde2CeOZ6fUG9h3xb-Nag One of our favorite spots to eat and drink.  We love it so much we had our Rehearsal Dinner in the newly renovated dinning room.  Picked up dinner tonight, enjoyed a great glass of wine and had the pleasant surprise of the gnocchi available as a special!!!  This used to be on the regular menu, and I so hope they bring it back- my absolute favorite!
