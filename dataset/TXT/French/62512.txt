SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ With so many amazing restaurants in the area (that charge the same high prices), I can't understand why this place gets good reviews. I can only assume people don't know any better and are so charmed by the historic bungalows that they can't see they are getting ripped off. I have been here twice with family, and the first time I thought the food was mediocre, and the second time confirmed it. The ceasar salad tasted like something you would get at Denny's, and the salmon came with what I can only describe as "airport quality" potato cubes that tasted like leftover morning hash browns. At least there were only a tiny amount of potatoes, next to a tiny amount of brussel sprouts - and all that for the same price of an amazing entree at a real 4 star restaurant. Please save your money and go someplace great. The service and drinks were fine, but the food is really sub par for the price.
