SJo_IjvzdRtCvZVN0cbrRQ I have only paid this much for breakfast once and that was in NYC. My husband and I both ordered 2 eggs, bacon, toast and coffee. He ordered an extra side of bacon and we split a very small helping of potatoes. The bill came to $35 with tip $7 the total was $42. You only get 1 small slice of toast....1. My over medium eggs were so runny they weren't even white it was clear and ran over my plate. I thought these chefs were top notch. Cooking eggs is pretty basic. The coffee was truly no different than the coffee I make at home. I just don't get the hype. Maybe we should've ordered the pumpkin omelette for $
