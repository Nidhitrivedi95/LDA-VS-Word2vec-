When we arrived, our drink menu in the center of the table had a note about the reservation following ours hanging over the top presumably to "remind" us that they were very busy and the table would be needed again that night...we also received a call confirming our reservation stating the same earlier in the day.  Our waitress, Brenda, claimed she couldn't work an iPhone to take a photo but would send the "bus boy" to take one of our group.  The most insulting portion of the evening was when Brenda chased us down Trade St. yelling that we hadn't left copies of our receipts.  We absolutely left signed copies and explained that; however, she insisted we come back to the restaurant and sign a new copy with the tip added.  During that (embarrassing for us) walk, she proceeded to inform us how embarrassing it was for her to have to run down the sidewalk yelling after us.  Overall, I was not impressed and will not be going back anytime soon.
