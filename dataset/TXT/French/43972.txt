m9aFZk1f8tSv248YErbpQA Wonderful location, splendid food, extremely fast and VERY attentive service.  This would be an easy 5 star rating in anyone else's book but I hold those for super special ratings.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
Our group of 8 arrived after the monthly Cars N Coffee event and as we strolled in we changed our group size from 6 to 8 within minutes yet were warmly greeted and the change was no problem.  

The setting was wonderful and beverage orders were quickly taken as we were given options for the daily specials.  I spied the Crepes Tutti Frutti and at $7.25 was pleasantly greeted with a large crepe of abundant fresh blueberries, strawberries, raspberries covered with whip cream and almonds then drizzled with honey.  Sacre bleu!  I will be back - Thank you.
