HL6ZzGF7V-KDaU0zziHyEA What a lovely evening out with dinner with two friends from out of town. We were on the veranda in the back the only complaints I have are the weather because it rain so hard it was difficult to hear that but the other issue Ihad was the size and width of the table made it difficult for a conversation without speaking loudly to each other. The service was impeccable and the food was very goodbut because of the prior ratings I expected a bit more in terms of flavor from this restaurant. I had the Pea soup with the seared scallops and the best part of the meal were the madeleines with coffee.
