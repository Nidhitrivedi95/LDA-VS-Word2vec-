dd3GZs6zW2t7BM0cbxAzvg I am always looks for restaurants that are walking distance with character. I found this gem on Yelp while looking for a french bistro. They have a great price fix for steak + an app + dessert. The front bar area would be a great place to people watch and grab a drink in the summer. And, the dining area bustles like an authentic Parisian restaurant. The escargot app with bone marrow was delicious. And, the mussels came with a generous portion. Both our steaks were done to our liking. Though, there was nothing particularly stand out about the meal here, the ambiance is what would take me back!
