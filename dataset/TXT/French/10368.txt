4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw To quote my husband, we rarely repeat any places when we make our annual Vegas pilgrimage, but this is one of the few we do.  For the price, excellent.  Love everything - the baguette at the beginning through to the end of the meal.  We had the smoked salmon appetizer, very good.  Our steak frites were fantastic, and the waitress brought me a side of Bordelaise and Roquefort since I could not decide.  Service was excellent; bread pudding dessert oh so good.  We've also been for lunch and have sat outside to people watch ... just as good.  Highly recommend!
