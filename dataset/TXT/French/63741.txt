T4g4k2OhCTsiqcP-ZXElHQ This isn't for the food, we always split the lamb board or steak and it's amazing. It's for the awful service, staff and vibes.

I come here a lot and plan on coming here again so I won't get too specific, we came in without a reservation, 7 tables were empty but "reserved" so we sat at the bar but the waitress assured us she'd give us the first available table. The chef cooks behind the bar and he is so loud and obnoxious he made us want to leave, he thinks he's competing on top chef hahaha, he's just a jerk.....Finally after 30 mins we're given one of the reserved tables that has been sitting open the whole time!!!

We get our food and as we are eating, we begin to find bits of other frozen food in our salad and fries. This happens 3 times, each time we tell the server. We're not assholes, we understand it happens. We are offered a free dessert which we decline and get the bill to find NO comps or even adjustments to make up for this gross, thrice repeated mistake. So frustrating and also fitting for the asshole chef. Food is still great tho.
