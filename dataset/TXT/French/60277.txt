SBnpT6JDbah-5l_52GM5sw So, I have probably eaten at Sardine over 20 times.  I love it.  Everything here is amazing.  While I am sad they took the skate wing off the menu, I have now discovered a whole new world of roasted chicken, duck, lamb, and most importantly, sticky toffee pudding.  LOVE.  And the oysters are amazing.  AMAZING.  Great service to boot.  The hostess with the short brown hair (the one without glasses) is sort of snooty though.
