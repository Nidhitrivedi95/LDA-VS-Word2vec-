COgwFthJpS4We16W5Gf4lw Excellent. I enjoyed the "stale" bread and crudite(aka random vegetables), both were beautifully served. Though, I usually don't eat a lot of that sort of preamble that most restaurants serve I thought I would mention them since they are the object of some criticism. 

The food was good. We started with scallops and pate. Between the four of us we had rack of lamb, lamb shank, fillet mignon, and assorted sides. We also had a bottle of wine.  

All excellent, total bill with tip $340
