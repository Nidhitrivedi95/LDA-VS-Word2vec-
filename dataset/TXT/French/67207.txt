USleI8g1UVN9-9jm-b4uIg Me and my husband are vegetarians , chef made a special main dish for one of us but it was not good at all. Appetizer was awesome  , it was beet root dish actually  forgot the name. We actually went there for our anniversary and chef made a special writing  on our dessert. Dessert was ok.Loved the overall experience of our special day .if you are vegetarians pasta was my recommendation here.
