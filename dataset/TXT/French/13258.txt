The menu has a variety of oprtions, you can't really go wrong - this most recent visit I ordered a half dozen oysters which were excellent. For an entree though, ignore the rest of the menu and order something from the steak frites section. This is what Mon Ami Gabi is known for and what you really should be getting. The peppercorn or bernaise ones are unbelievable - the fries are equally as satisfying.
