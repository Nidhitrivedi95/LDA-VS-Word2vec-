Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA Incredible!!!! Had a chefs tasting that was over the top and truly just delicious from start to finish! We went to celebrate my friends birthday and have a girls night out and am so please we decided to go to Mix! We were greeted with champagne and had wine flowing the rest of the night! The food was just an explosion of flavor -- my favorite dish was the coconut curry lobster over jasmine rice and I am still dreaming of the most delicious creme brûlée that I've ever had!  Can't wait to go back again and soon!!!
