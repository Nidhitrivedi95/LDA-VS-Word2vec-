ey9c-TjWXgTJ5OlD0HPd_A This is a cute little place for a brunch or lunch. We had 2 savory and 2 sugary waffles, and all were excellent. The brightly colored shop is also wonderful - puts you in a good mood as soon as you come in. 

One tip: their brunch menus are quite expensive (around $CAN15-25 because you are paying for coffee and orange juice and fruit salad and so on, which are not the restaurant's specialty), but it is not that expensive if you just take waffles (~CAN$6 for a savory one, ~CAN$4 for a sugary one - enjoy!)
