lKizOgdtB18KR5D8kKm9-Q Food was fine, but awful location choice. Liberty Village is mostly offices filled with hungry people looking for reasonably-priced lunch. Once everyone goes home for the day, it's an empty wasteland, especially Jefferson, where this place was located. The Rotisserie House and It'z a Wrap next door always do good business, because the food is quick and under $8. Nobody wants to go to a sit-down French restaurant for Crepes. As soon as it opened, I knew they were on borrowed time. A shame, because the food and ambience were good. Just a bad, bad location pick, sorry guys.
