mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q This restaurant just came up and topped my list out of nowhere. Definitely on par with some of the best of the best (I'm still not sure if it beats out French Laundry and Coi just yet). 

This is by far the most beautiful restaurant I've been to. Absolutely gorgeous in every aspect. Unique, contemporary, and strikingly pretty. If French Laundry is the chateau and Coi is the main house, this is the Manhattan bachelor pad. 

The food was all quite incredible, and the service was great. i cannot wait to try more of Robuchon's stuff.
