7n2Ln3ZwBNTH0TEh4tZFuw First time eating Mauritian food! It's a family run business and you have to reserve a table as there is only three tables of 4 and two tables of 6, and pre-booking your food is highly recommended as the prep work takes a long time. 

The service is great, the lady cooks, serves and makes you feel welcomed. 

The place is oddly on the side of a building facing the backroads,  but I went on a Sat evening and there was free Green P parking next door. 

Lots of mauritian decor and music,  though we were surprises that everything was served in disposable cups and cutlery.  Even the table cloths were plastic and we were sitting on foldable chairs. Probably understandable as they newly opened in Sept 2016.

For four people, we ordered 5 dishes, and it was juat enough. Please note that one dish is reallyyyy small and should probably order more. 

The lamb halim is served on baguette, and has curry flavour. You have more of the lentils than lamb so it tastes like a lentil soup. 

The chicken masala was delicious with mild indian flavours. It comes with a small serving of rice, a side of our choice (coconut chutney)  and two rotis. Their rotis are soft, doughy and has the same taste and texture of Peking duck pancake wrap. 

Similarly,  the lima bean masala is served the same. 

Quite disappointed with their fried noodles with chicken and eggs. It comes in a small take out container,  and for $10, doesn't seem worth it. The noodles are cold and hard,  tastes just like the fried noodles you get at dim sum places. I don't recommend. 

We also got a ti-puree 7 carries banana leaf set to try. This is good for one person and they had a special $15 per set (must pre order). The dish is popular at Mauritian Hindu weddings. I forgot to take a picture,  but the presentation wasn't like the one in their website. It is served on a banana leaf,  but the curries were served in little styrofoam cups. 

The 7 curries are 
-mashed pumpkin
 -rougaille (tomatoes) 
-curry barry with ground yellow peas mixed with herbs
 -kutchou (stewed taro leaves) 
 -lima beans in masala
-sweet and mushy 'chouchou' (chayote) 
-bittersweet tamarind sauce 'takkar'

The ti-puri tastes jusy like their roti,  except fried and a little puffier.

Knowing the cuisine is like Indian food with milder flavours, this place is okay. Good service,  okay food, it was nice for a new cultural experience. There's only another Mauritian restaurant in the GTA, downtown, and I heard that one is better so I'll try that one next time.
