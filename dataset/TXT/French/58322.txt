rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Today we visited for lunch. My Cobb salad was amazing and I have to tell u the best I've ever had. The chicken is fresh and moist. The bacon is fresh thick cut pieces. Just the perfect amount of dressing. Nothing over done. My husband chose the fresh made waffle with fresh cream and berries on top. He loved it. And the ice tea comes in this adorable glass carafe with the freshest lemon wedges on top. We had a lovely start to our day!
