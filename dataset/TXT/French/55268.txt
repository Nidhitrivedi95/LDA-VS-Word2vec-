rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Stay at the Venetian a number of times, and this was my 3rd or 4th time at Bouchon. This time, I dined with the Canadian King of Scotch and The King of Calculations from Cal.  

Appetizer - Foie Gras (now outlawed in California) with short rib was extraordinary. As the Canadian King of Scotch said, it is an inspired combination, savory, sweet and incredibly rich! - 5 stars

Wine - The King of Scotch selected a nice white wine from France, refreshing with a nice earthy mineral finish - the sommelier complemented the selection, and thanked us for ordering a grand but overlooked wine. - 4 Stars

Entree - Scallops with citrus foam.  Plum scallops seasoned to perfection and cooked just right.  The citrus foam combination imparted an almost Maine Lobster flavor. - outstanding 5 Stars.

Service - attentive, consultative, sold us just the right amount and directed us to truly incredible selections that made this an exceptional and memorable experience.

The Canadian King talked about the unique and difficult cooking techniques, and the waiter complimented him on his knowledge.  I asked the waiter if we could have a tour of the kitchen.  We were invited back the following afternoon, when they were not in full swing.  The kitchens were incredible.  Large, orderly, and ran impeccably, in a quiet but efficient alacrity.  We were impressed with the gleaming, modern equipment.  Despite this, our host mentioned that they plan to significantly renovate the kitchens to keep up-to-date.

Bouchon runs a largish crew, but they can handle a full dinning room and support large private parties at the same time.  We saw the TV screens that Thomas Keller uses to monitor the culinary operations.

We kept the manager's business card.  We're hoping it will help us get into French Laundry (but that's another story for another time, I hope)
