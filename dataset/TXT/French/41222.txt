kGOr_D-LNpgZ2M9N8TT4QQ This restaurants decor just makes my dining experience better, it's so beautiful and dare I say, French-esque. 

Its got an incredibly friendly, attentive, knowledgable staff along with some hotties ;)

We both ordered a glass of white wine( our waiter recommended it to go well with our seafood dishes. I wish I knew or remembered the name) 

Lunch Menu:

Pan Seared Sea Scallops -$32
Pea<U+200B> puree, pea and pancetta regout, crispy pancetta 

Pan Seared Irish Organic Salmon -$26
Roasted chesnut and cauliflower, spinach, cauliflower puree, trout roe

The portions were so tasty!! We got stuffed and couldn't finish it despite the amazing flavours. No room for any dessert either :( I really wanted to try the Grand Marnier Creme Brûlée!
