oQIm77kYhudya-36pZ-3_w Passed by this place while driving and finally had to give it a try.

The staffs are friendly and they speak French and English. 

For the longest time I almost gave up on finding amazing croissants in Toronto. My favourite croissants has that flakey crispy melt in your mouth feeling. I can find them in France but also in Montreal. Before I found Ma Maison I used to go to Crema for croissants and latte but since ma Maison is close to the studio where I work I decided to give it a try. 

The croissants are gooooood!! My favorite is the plain one and the almond chocolate one. They also serve good coffee and latte. Their breakfast croissant is amazing as well wih scrambled eggs tomato and bacon for only $5.75. Very reasonable, they also serve a lot of hot food but I am a bit hesitant for now since the prices for those are on then higher end. If the other items were cheaper this place would be given 5 stars. Location could also be better since it's in a strip mall. However I think this place would have line ups or could be way too busy if it was in a different location so I kinda like it as it is like my secret croissant getaway!
