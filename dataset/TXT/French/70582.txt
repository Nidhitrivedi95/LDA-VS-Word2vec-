xaqW4NkmUCGRRjmLxiFJ6Q I've been going to Muncheez for a while now and I'm just getting around to writing a review. It's only fair to give it a 5 star rating as this place is as good as it gets. 

The staff are nice and attentive. Always on top of things to make sure you walk out happy. I personally can't ask for more when it comes to getting good service.

The food is just amazing. I've tried most of the items on the menu (they come up with new items often, so gotta keep up). Loved it all, but my personal favourite is the Philly Cheese Steak. Their Sugarcane juice is out of this world, especially if you add avocado and mint to it.

Great overall experience every-time I go in. Go see for yourself.
