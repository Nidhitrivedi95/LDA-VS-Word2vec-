t1mR_Zff6Dqv1TueE2JLEA We actually were in the lounge part downstairs called BerBer .The staff super friendly and helpful. And they consulted with me on all aspects of the planning.
Had our Office Christmas party there in December.
Enjoyed the belly dancing with the snake, but I was expecting a larger snake than the little Albino Boa she had. I think it was a new one.
The food was great.
We had a party of 40 people and only 2 waiters, which was a little weird. But it worked out I guess. Our wait wasn't too long for our food. And normally waiting means they are making it fresh.
My one complaint: the crab cakes were oily. And our seats were too close together which made for uncomfortable, awkward eating.
Would definitely go there again.
