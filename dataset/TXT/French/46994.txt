Solid happy hour menu with dishes from $3-5. On the menu that week, most dishes came with pork as an homage to their name! Even the frites have pork belly in it. We got the frites, the pasta dish, pork belly sandwich, and a grilled cheese sandwich. The favorites were the pork belly sandwich and the frites. All was very good.

On Wednesdays, the bartender experiments with cocktails for $5. 

We left really full from the food and fun convo with the bartender. We'll be back for more happy hour!
