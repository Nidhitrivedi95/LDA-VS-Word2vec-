Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA Wow. amazing. awesome. We had a large group of girls, and one of them had a connection to the restaurant so we got very lucky and got to sit at the chef's table overlooking Vegas.. what a view! The food, while very expensive, was very delicious. 

After eating, we stayed for drinking and partying, and it ended up being one of our favorite places we went to on our trip! They have a smallish balcony/outdoor area overlooking the city as well, great photo ops! Drinks of course pricey, but so what. The crowd was great.

The bathroom? You have to go see, I mean pee, for yourself!
