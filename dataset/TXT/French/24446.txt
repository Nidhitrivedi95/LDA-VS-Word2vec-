cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg Please refer to my photographs. The most decadent meal of my life. We ate an absurd amount of food because we had to try as much as we could! 

Onion soup gratinee. The PDC twist? Ham in the soup. So good.

Blue cheese, apple and lettuces salad. Very fresh and a wonderful blend of sweet and tart. 

Two, count them, TWO foie gras dishes: foie gras poutine (glad I tried it but I learned there is such a thing as too much foie gras) and another foie gras masterpiece (cannot recall the name), a perfectly seared piece of foie gras on top of a piece of ham blanketed by melted cheese, doused with maple syrup. Sounds weird, tastes amazing. 

PDC Melting Pot: two types of sausage and pork shoulder atop mashed potatoes and a couple other vegetables. Who really cares about the vegetables, this restaurant is called The Pig's Foot for God's sake! This dish was so tasty.

Dark chocolate pot de creme which arrived in a weird, very rustic jar. A perfect ending to an absurdly rich, delightful meal. 

Loud, vibrant, unpretentious atmosphere, friendly service. Great fun, great food. Definitely coming back one day.
