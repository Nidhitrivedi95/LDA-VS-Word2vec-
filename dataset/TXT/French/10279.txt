4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Food was good but price was pretty hefty.

The warm bread was butter were disappointing.  The bread smelled fabulous but it definitely did not remind me of the yummy baguettes in Paris.  The butter was rock hard and smelled of freezer burn.

The onion soup was dellish.
The quiche lorraine was good, not great. Bit expenssive at $15.95 since it doesn't come with anything else. 
The Classic Steak Frites was fabulous.  The steak was perfectly seared and well seasoned.  The sauce on top wasn't overpowering and made for a great accompaniment.  The fries were perfectly crisp.

Soup, quiche, steak frites, and class of wine came to be $75.  So after tip, it's almost a $100 lunch.  Bit expensive for lunch but at least the people watching from the patio seating is great.
