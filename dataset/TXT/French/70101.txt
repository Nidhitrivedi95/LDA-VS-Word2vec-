wwgRu0TAMX8rfRhsiI0ifQ My wife an I stopped in Saturday evening.  We had to wait 15 minutes for a table.  This wasn't an issue s8nce mg wife hit a royal while we waited.  After being seated the manager came to our readers table to apologize for the wait.  The staff was amazing.  Very polite an quick.  Since we were flush with cash we decide to get the Calamari,  Escargot and Caprese salad.  The escargot was top notch.  Some of the best I ever had.  The caprese salad was delicious and the calamari was really good too. For drinks I ordered the Cucumber Cooler which was amazing,  the waiter suggested it and I was glad I tried it. 
 For the main meal I had the  Chicken Milanese which was great and my wife at the New York Strip which was one of the best steaks I've ever had. 

Can't wait to go back..
