6Hj4AQ5DDGf7tsVk6LscLQ Came here after a TFC game for drinks and was impressed with the atmosphere. There were some interesting beers on the menu (local one right from Liberty Village, belgian beers, etc). and the prices were not exorbitant at all. I didn't have anything to eat this time but saw some appetizing things go out around us so would definitely come back for lunch or dinner some day.
