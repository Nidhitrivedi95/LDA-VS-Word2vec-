OYHpqY6-3C-wXR-uPbHhwA Total Yelp 5-star find in far NLV. Want lightning fast service and casino Starbucks pastries trucked in from who knows where, then don't come here. This is a small business with big heart. The people who greet you and serve you are the same people who made your food by hand on site with great skill and care. If there is any criticism, it would be trying to do too many great things all at once. But they do them all very well. Brisket for breakfast? Yes! Smoked in back. Fluffy scrambled eggs. 10 types of macarons, all made fresh with almond flour. Gelato dressed for success in the front display case. And as promised, chef Anthony's personal favorite, the butterscotch muffin was off the charts!  Calling all Vegas foodies!!!
