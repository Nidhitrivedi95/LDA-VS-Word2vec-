mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q Have made it in twice.  First time had the tasting menu.  Super fun fronting the kitchen.  All items where fantastic.  Pace of the dinner was good also.  Not rushed, and not dragged out.  Had cocktails to start, then they let us continue with wine pairings.  Recommend the tasting as it gives you a grand journey of Joel Robuchon's ideas.
