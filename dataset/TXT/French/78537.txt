Then it's like a cafeteria line where you can pick ready made items or shuffle through to the end and place your order at the register. Which is what we did. You Pay get a cup for your coffee or glass for your drink. Sit down and they will bring out your food. Up to this part it's a fast food, cafeteria and self service restarunt combination. It does work but not a fan. Now the food is another story. That we liked with one exception. The eggs, sausage and French style hash browns were good but the croissant was cold and there were no jellies or butters on the table. You had to ask for them. There was nobody refilling your drink you did that. I rated this establishment lower than it should be due to the style of service not the food because the food was good I just didn't like the procedure to get the food.  But do try it at least once you may feel different.
