KBSCJcWGk9QNPX9MTSlM3Q They have a great happy hour, all appetizers are half off! My favourite meal is the mac an cheese and comes with a nice salad, but everything is fantastic. The servers are all really nice and attentive, and want to have conversations with you. Its become my new local place! Also, there's a hot Irish bartender there.
