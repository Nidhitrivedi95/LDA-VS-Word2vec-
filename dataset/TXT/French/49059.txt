OmFXBWLv1DoFelP2-RLqFA HELLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO FOIE GRAS HEAVEN!

This was for our #salaciouscanada tour which will be posted at tastytwosome.com shortly.

Okay. FOURRRRRRRRRRRRR dishes of foie.  FOUR.

Foie gras poached in red wine
Foie gras and truffle oil (pan seared)
Foie gras and mushrooms (pan seared)
Foie gras and duck gizzards (pan seared)

WHAT? FOIE GRAS HEAVEN.

If you're looking to go to Montreal for foie. This is your place.  Forget au pied de cochon.  This place... THIS place is where you need to be.

Also had awesome decor and you can sit at tables with swings (uber cute), the ambience is sexy, and it's beautiful.  Great wine list, and greeeeeat menu beside the foie.

But the foie... oh the foie...
