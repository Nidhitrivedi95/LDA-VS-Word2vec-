hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA After an aerial work-out at Shine kicking my butt, I was hungry and decided on The Baguette after reading yelp reviews and because it was nearby.  The line around 1 pm was out the door!  I took a deep breath and got in line, because I figured people are queuing, because it's good.  Indeed, it is.  At first I was going to order the Moroccan, but decided against it, as I think tomatoes are evil and instead ordered the curry sandwich with chicken.  As a treat for getting my butt kicked at Shine, I treated myself to their peanut butter chocolatechip cookie.  I took my goodies back with me to the hotel and the sandwich was still very warm!  The cookie was almost an inch thick! 

The sandwich oh so de-lightfully delicious!  The cookie was wonderful as it was not very sweet.  The cashier had mentioned that cookies are a once in awhile thing and the croissants are there daily, which is why I chose a cookie as my treat.  

I'd go to the Baguette every day if there was one in my hood.  Definitely stop by and you won't be disappointed.  The food is worth the wait!
