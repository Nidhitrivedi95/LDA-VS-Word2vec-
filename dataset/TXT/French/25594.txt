Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA We were there on Saturday and were shocked to learn that no tasting menu available because thet were too busy. Yeah right, if there's no tasting menu, then post it on the website so we would not have gone! The food is just so so; the foie gras was a bit tough, the mac and cheese was a huge disappointment and the filet was tasteless. The best thing is the view. For really good food, try Aureole instead. Been there three times and never been disappointed.
