O66Zy8Y13VBm72ZDhS4fIg Had a nice dinner here having purchased a groupon, our server was friendly and attentive making for a good dining experience. 

For apps:
Lobster bites: Fried green tomatoe with lobster, fish eggs and greens on top. This was tasty and had a good combination of flavours.
Baked Escargots: There were about 8 escargots baked in a creamy cheese sauce with mushrooms, served with crustini. This was heavier so I found it good for sharing.

Main: 
Beef Striploin: This was pretty big (10oz) cooked to a perfect medium with horse radish butter on top, which added nice flavour. This was served with creamy kale and mushroom and roasted sunchoke. The creamy kale and mushroom was very salty...and I found myself drinking a lot of water that night.

Dessert:
Strawberry rhubarb cheesecake:  This was a nice cheesecake, with a hint of tart rhubarb on the inside. (it was crustless) perfect end to a meal.
Maple Beignets: I was expecting a warm light and fluffy beignet, and was disappointed it tasted more like a tim bit. The amaretto creme anglaise was good. After my first bite, I regret not ordering the milk chocolate mousse instead.
