Dcj69NZJnbJhK-YHP_nULA What did Monroe Street ever do without Brasserie V?  I'm astonished at how unbelievably busy this place was straight out of the cage.  The beer selection is its signature and quite good.  The food is typical bistro and also quite good.  But seriously kids, buy yourself a few more restaurants in Dudgeon-Monroe.  The west-siders are desperate to EAT OUT.

Note: I'm adding an extra star here because I hear the chef bailed and opened his own restaurant down the street.  Poor form, dude.
