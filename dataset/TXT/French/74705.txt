We made a reservation late in the day the day of our anniversary. They were unable to give us a table by the window (make a reservation by 4:30pm to get one!) but we still got a table with a view of the Bellagio fountains. 
We ordered cocktails at the bar, which were delicious. The entrees were delicious. I got a beef Wellington and my husband got a king filet minon. Both were spectacular. Then for dessert we tried one of their signature soufflés in the pistachio flavor. Perfectly light and delicious! 
They have a person who will take a photo of you for $25. They were super willing to work with me to get the perfect anniversary photo. 
I definitely recommend this place for special events.
