4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw my mexican and I went here for lunch on a Tuesday afternoon. we sat inside next to the patio with a view of the bellagio fountains which was gorgeous. 

What we ordered:
-first they serve you a fresh french baguette with butter- delicious. 
-bowl of non-fat latte which was delish... a little cold though. 
-shared  the french onion soup... ho-ly YUM. seriously soooo good, very rich though. 
-I ordered the croque monsieur which was pretty good. it came with frites... a little to thin/ fried for me. reminded me more of a garnish.
-my mexican ordered their steak sandwich which he devoured.
-finished off with a butter & cinnamon crepe served with whipped cream on the side. this isn't on the menu, just something my cousin had recommended and OH.EM. GEE. seriously, so simple but SO SO SOOO good. the thing was HUGE (at least 10" in diam) and im pretty sure I ate 2/3 of it myself lol.

Service was ok... kind of slow but that was expected. we were happy to just be  hanging out with good food and a beautiful view. prob not the best place to go if you're wanting something quick.
