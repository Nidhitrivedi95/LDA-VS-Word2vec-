T4shscbr3BU3yb6EA3BSfA Our second night in Montreal. Second restaurant that we picked out from Eater 38 Montreal. Very cozy place, classic French dish. The wait staff is accommodating and knowledgable. Wine list was great. 
Food: amazing!
The appetizer special (crabs fillet with crab broth and foam) was so delicious! Arctic char was so flavorful, couchon was perfectly cooked, gniochetti ( their version of cavatelli) was so good. To cut the long story short, I highly recommend this place. It's an A+!!!
