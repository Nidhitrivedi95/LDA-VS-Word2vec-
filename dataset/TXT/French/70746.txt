xaqW4NkmUCGRRjmLxiFJ6Q Went in for an afternoon snack - wasn't terribly hungry so I got a strawberry Nutella crepe and their notorious sugar cane juice (just plain, but my cousin got it mixed with avacado and it was absolutely amazingggg. ) my crepe was fluffy and fresh - I'll be sure to go back to try their savory crepes next week! another cousin of mine tried their avacado marshmallow Nutella crepe - sounds weird right? but he assures me that it was worth it! They put a lot of work into their crepes. All the ingredients are laid out evenly and a lot of care is put into each crepe :)
What really made the experience was the customer service. They were super friendly and excited to explain their menu items. They possess all the qualities that will set them up for success... and my next visit! :)
