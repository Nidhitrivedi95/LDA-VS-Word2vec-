xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g Very romantic!  If this place doesn't get you laid or at least to third base, I don't know what will!  The views of the Bellagio fountains are priceless!  Too bad you can't hear the songs that the water is dancing to! We came to celebrate our anniversary! He got brownie points, that's for sure!  Our friends have gotten engaged here!  So again, romantic place! 

The food was absolutely excellent!  Pricey, but well worth it!  The drinks were amazing too!  It better be for about $20/drink!  I highly recommend the filet!  The bartender recommended it and now I must pass it along!  The waiter brought out both the red wine and hollandaise sauce!  I LOVE them both! So ask to get all the sauces if possible and decide for yourself!
