uP3H5bcsiTXM0k0xQhRndg Outstanding first meal in Montreal. Thanks to yelp for the recommendation. No wait at 6pm. Staff was super friendly, some of them are family of the owner. Loved everything we ordered - three of us shared the creamy onion soup with jalapeños, Ultimate (perfect pork belly), and mac and cheese with Christmas ham.  Plenty of food considering we smacked at a Chinese bakery on the way over.  No room for desert (until we walked around town a bit)
