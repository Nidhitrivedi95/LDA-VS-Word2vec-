4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I went to this place for a 1st date.  In all fairness, this is not a good 1st date establishment.  We were seated in a corner area. The staff were wonderful and our waiter was excellent, full of knowledge and jokes.

The outdoor tables are 1st come/serve. You'll have a view of all the folks walking the strip and the Bellagio Dancing Water Fountain show.  The crowd is very loud so I'm not sure how romantic that would be.

Again for the record, we were set in indoors but in a corner area.

Reservations should be made (you will not be seated until the entire party has arrived). We made reservations.

Perfect outdoor spot to watch the water show.

We both had seafood dishes.  

(Update). I do not recall the name of the dish I had but it was a etouffee like seafood dish served in a pot.  Yummy...but is for 2 (not for one person).. would go as far as saying that three could comfortably eat on this dish
