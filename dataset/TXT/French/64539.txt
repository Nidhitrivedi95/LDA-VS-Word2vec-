Seeing the five stars this place has inclined me to come in.  
But, actually experiencing the five stars was something I was not expecting. 
This place is quaint, quiet, and cute. 
The food was amazing, the service was awesome, and the coffee was the bees knees. 
I was embarrassed to bring my Starbucks in and felt inclined to purchase a latte from them, but I'm not disappointed. 
Most definitely coming back.
