4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw My first brunch at this place and our family was all happy. We were seated outside so the view was nice. It was too early to watch Bellagio fountain show but it was sti nice. I'm assuming it was the A/C from the inside because we would feel the cool breeze once in a while that kept us away from the heat. 

Their coffee was awesome and food was great too. I would definitely come back.
