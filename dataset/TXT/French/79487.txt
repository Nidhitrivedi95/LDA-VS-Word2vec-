Zm49-4emuoqhfb-nOPEYOg I believe my actual quote was, "I didn't know crêpes could be this good." 

And I know that sounds cheesy, but it's true. This is way beyond anything I've ever experienced as a crêpe, this side of Bretagne. I had the Mile End and it was perfect. Chock full of spinach and mushrooms and gooey with melted cheddar cheese.

My husband had a breakfast plate involving some delicious sausage and - of course, my test for every brunch spot - really good potatoes. And it came with a locally sourced croissant.

As with all places that get my 5-star seal of approval, it was the little touches that made the difference. The fruit salad is not some kind of throwaway garnish. It's an actual fruit salad, with perfectly ripe fruit. The kind you want to eat (the kind that is not two pieces of pale cantaloupe and a cube of watermelon). And the coffee was great as well.

The ambiance is awesome, although, on a hot summer day, you may end up waiting on a terrasse spot because it's just too hot inside. Know that. And know that it's worth the wait. I can't wait to come back for a cozy winter lunch indoors and sit right next to the steamy hot crêpe pans that are openly on display.

Oh, and the service was really good too. Usually when I walk in and see a bunch of early-twenty-somethings I get nervous, but they were super attentive and clearly well-trained by the management.
