Ncvd4l3zo72FUK5kovQhYQ Delicious! I was grabbing coffee nearby and asked a local a good place for lunch. He recommended this adorable little French cafe. 

Their menu has a great list of sandwiches and salads. They also have a ton of sides such as roasted red potatoes , macaroni & cheese, sauteed apples ect.

I decided on the BLTTA-- bacon lettuce tomato turkey avocado. It was served on a buttery croissant and i got to choose one side. I went with a side salad. I decided to eat in.

My sandwich was fabulous and the salad was hearty. Their salad dressing was great but unsure of the dressing.. Possibly French lol 

I noticed someone's French onion soup and it looked great! Stop in you won't be disappointed
