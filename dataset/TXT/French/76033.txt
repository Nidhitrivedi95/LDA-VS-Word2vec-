ynYEgNimJOyb8dvyr9x0sA 7 friends & I ate at Le Chalet as our last meal to cap off a wonderful visit to sunny AZ! What a great choice!!!! We loved the feel of the place, very cozy and clean. Our waitress was Tracy & she couldn't have been more accommodating. She explained all the menu choices very well and answered all our questions(with 8 of us we had alot). We started our meal with the cheese fondue! Great taste & wonderful way to start our culinary journey! Next our entrees: We all loved the crepes, the buckwheat was so good. The friends that ordered the scallops said they were the best they have ever had. I tried the La Potence. Very good, loved all the sauces & very impressive to have it cooked they way they do at the table. Dessert was fabulous. We tried the salted caramel fondue & the chocolate fondue. Both were wonderful but if you have to make a choice, choose the salted caramel. The tart apple & the cream puffs dipped in it were to die for! This was an experience we will remember for a long time & thank all the staff that helped make it such a wonderful reminder of the fun we had in AZ. I plan to be back in February & am already making plans to eat here again.
