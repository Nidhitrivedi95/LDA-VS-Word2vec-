bzbNGyrTwWHAgg1CqkSgeg I don't usually write reviews, or ever give 5 stars, but I had one of the BEST breakfasts I have ever had at Terrace Cafe. I'm a big fan of red velvet cake, so when I saw they had a red velvet waffle, I had to try it. In a word: AMAZING. Not too sweet, light fluffy batter, cream cheese "syrup".... Like nothing I've ever had before. I ordered it with fried chicken, which was a boneless, generously sized crispy piece of all white meat, served on the side. I put it on the waffle for a pure decadent taste experience. Yum, yum, yum!

And as a side note, my order came with hash browns, which were some of the best I've ever had. Obviously they were fresh, shredded by hand with just the right amount of onion mixed in for flavor, and fried to a crispy golden finish on top. My boyfriend is kind of a picky eater, and he could not stop raving about how great the hash browns were.

Excellent service, full bar (I had a mimosa), and a nice comfortable atmosphere (we ate outside) all make this place a "must visit" whenever I'm in Charlotte.
