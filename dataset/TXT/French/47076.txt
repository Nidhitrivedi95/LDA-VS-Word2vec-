nXlKHnArL3_vugmnytsEYQ We've been wanting to check the crested duck out for a while as its right up the road. We stopped by for brunch today and it was great. We brought our own bubbly and enjoyed some mimosas. The coffee was also great. It's very hard to decide that to get. We tried their version of French toast and the charcuterie plate for our first course and both were very good. We had the frittata and duck hash for our second course. We were stuffed but finished everything. Everything was very fresh and perfectly cooked. We definitely will be stopping by for brunch again. I'm excited to try their dinner now also. I would definitely recommend!! Thanks for a great meal.
