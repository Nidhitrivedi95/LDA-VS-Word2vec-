hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA Love this place!  Takes us home to France. C'est delicieux! We are here very regularly and recommend everything in the menu. Favorites include the chocolate tart (omg!), the quiche Lorraine, the Moroccan sandwich, the blue Brie sandwich,  the daily soup never disappoints, and of course you must have the Illy coffee. Best of all they are now open weekends - finally!
