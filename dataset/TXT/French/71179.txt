xcmmTXhuMx2fZF2Bt69F4w Although you'll undoubtedly have to wait (even on any weeknight) it is well worth it.

The place was created with the intent of being a neighborhood joint, and it does that very well.  It is filled with regulars, some of which immediately struck up a conversation with me as I sat at the bar enjoying a Belgium beer waiting for my table.

The menu is short and changes often but you will not be disappointed.  Some of the dishes are pricey but it will never bust your budget (unless you enjoy a number of the many beers).  I'll be sure to be back often and soon.
