Nothing to add that other reviewers haven't mentioned already: The croissants are very, very good (particularly the croissant auxes almande), the tarte au citron is almost perfect with the beautiful lemon acidity balanced with the sweet richness of the shell, the mini tarte tatins and tarte au poire are fantastic, and the mille feuille and opera pastries are decadent without being cloying. The only thing I can think of to improve is to add an espresso counter (apologies if I missed it). Highly recommended!
