bRmb81XDG3E2SOHARBLTog I went to Bodega today for the first time. We were supposed to be eating Brunch, but the person who accepted the booking didn't inform the lady who made the booking that there would be no brunch because of Winterlicious, despite being asked to confirm that a brunch menu would be available.

Luckily, their Winterlicious menu looked good. I ordered the Beet Salad, the Grilled Salmon & the Banana Cake.

The Beet salad was very good & the seasoning was perfect.

The Grilled salmon was nice, but there was very little sauce and a lot of lentils, which made it an average dish. (I tried the beef that my partner had ordered and it was pretty good.)

The Banana cake with Toffee sauce was ok. It was too sweet and rich for my liking.

The portions were good & overall the food was a 3.5 stars.

The reason I am giving it 2 stars is that the service wasn't great. It took the staff about 20 minutes to take our order. We were the first people in the restaurant and were a large group. At the time we were seated there was nobody else in there.

I had to leave early for a play and so went to our server and asked her to give me a bill for my portion. She told me it wasn't easy to get my bill because it was a group and that's how the software worked and that it would take her a couple of minutes to print it out. Nearly 10 minutes later, I was still standing there, waiting for her to get my bill while she passed by me several times and went to other tables.

I realise that the place was busy, but 10 minutes to get the bill for someone who has told them that they have to catch a play, is just ridiculous. There was also no apology and finally someone from our group volunteered to pay my bill and asked me to pay her back later. 

I will definitely avoid Bodega. While the food is not bad, the service clearly needs improvement.
