O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q As soon as I landed in Vegas I had to grab something to eat . I decided to give this place a try since it's conveniently located where I was staying.
The hostess sat us and our server promptly took our drink order.  Bottom less mimosas is $25 compared to $13 a glass. So why not? The server always made sure my glass was never empty. I didn't even need to find my server oncee! Kudos! For brunch I ordered a prosciutto and beet salad.  Something light but so satisfying! Everything was so fresh and the Beet added such a nice medley to the salad!
Overall I had a great brunch and 1st meal in Vegas! I will be back!
