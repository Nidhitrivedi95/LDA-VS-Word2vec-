4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I have been here for dinner with my husband. We order the 2 wine, one appetizer, one steak, and one scallop.  real like scallop, must try! But the steak, it's not my favorite. We also order the one pudding, and warm chocolate cake. Price around $130. I feel the price is a little bit high, but the view is gorgeous, you can saw the bellagio water fountain.
