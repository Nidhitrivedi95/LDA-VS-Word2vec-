cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg First time visiting Montreal and with rave reviews from yelp, I knew I had to book a reservation here.  We were not disappointed!  The only reservation available was 10:30pm on Thu and we gladly accepted.  

Pinot Noir - good 
Poutine - never had before and although the cheese curds were unusual for a topping, they proved to be delicious with the gravy
Duck in a Can - excellent presentation, rich and savory over sauteed veggies, toast? and mashed potatoes
Stuffed Pig's foot w/foie gras - signature dish - when my husband ordered this, the waiter warned him it was a big dish.  There was no exaggeration there.  Everyone surrounding us stared as it was brought to the table.  When placed in front of him, the crowd cheered ooh aaahh.  Patrons waiting in line for a table looked in amazement and asked "What is that?!"  De-li-cious!

Definitely make a reservation here.  We are certainly glad we did.  And would return in a heartbeat.
