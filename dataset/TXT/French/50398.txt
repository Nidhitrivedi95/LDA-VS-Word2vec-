 I don't like braggers at all but I will tell you that I have had the opportunity of dining in New York, Paris, Los Angeles and Dallas, Hawaii, In fact very few friends know about these experiences. The only reason I share this annoying bit of background is because I know a wonderful restaurant when I find one! Thus, I will say that Vogue must have a fine chef in their kitchen. That's Vogue's saving grace. The service was 50/50. If they visited your table more often it would be an improvement. Forever to visit our table  throughout the meal. Forgot all about our to-go meal.  An excellent locale if you are on a date, not excellent if you are on date night with your spouse of 20 odd years. Or In-laws. Waiting for meal or check is sooo long.
The dishes we chose were perfect. I will only go again on a quiet evening when they aren't so under staffed. Location is very nice. Again, quiet out of the way. Plenty of shade for parking.
