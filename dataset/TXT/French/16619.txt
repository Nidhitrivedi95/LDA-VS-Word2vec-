8ciT6qjI18x9EPtOb-gqYQ I really wish I could give five stars because for the most part, we had an amazing dinner. We had two appetizers but the onion tart was my favorite and definitely lived up to the hype. I had the chicken and instead of saving half for left overs, I ate it all. My friends had the filet and the salmon which were delicious too. Finished it all off with a tasty cappuccino and the lemon tart. Which was good until I got a mouthful of plastic. When we told one of the servers, she didn't seem too surprised, shrugged and said "Oh no, that's too bad." And that was that. It wasn't taken away, replaced, or removed from our considerable bill. For what we paid, I would have at least liked an acknowledgement for the mistake. If I do go back, it won't be for a while.
