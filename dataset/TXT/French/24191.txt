cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg Absolutely miserable experience.  My wife and I are foodies from NYC who heard a lot about this place and read all of the great reviews.

Unfortunately, we were extremely disappointed.  10:30 reservation and sat at 11pm (get your schedule straight)

Ordered a bottle of wine and 2 dishes.  Pasta dish first was pretty good.  Then watched our "duck in a can" sit on the shelf for a half hour before the waiter brought it over-honestly no thanks.  They charged us for the wine only which was appreciated, but would have rather paid whatever to have a good experience.  Glad our hotel has quality room service.

O well I guess you win some/ lose some.  We will never return.
