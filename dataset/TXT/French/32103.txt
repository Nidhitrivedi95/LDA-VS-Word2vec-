The view was amazing, the food was amazing and the service was phenomenal. 

I came with three friends and all of us ordered the Christmas tasting menu. Foie gras, calamari, rib-eye... My god, it was an experience. One of the best 7-course meals I have tried thus far. The waiter suggested an amazingly mixed cocktail...that hit the spot  and the other wait service were all just as amazing, accommodating and polite. I'm a sucker for pretentious gimick, so i tickled me pick with all the bougie etiquettes on par.

From left side serving to the announcement of every course, we were all impressed with the attentiveness of the staff. This is definitely customer service at it's best and it's so incredibly refreshing to see waiters who take their jobs seriously and yet still seemingly enjoy working. 

The decoration was clean and beautiful. As mentioned countless time, ambiance is incredibly important to me. I love the lighting and the whole atmosphere. It was definitely a worthy experience. 

I paid $175 for my whole meal and I think it was worth every cent! From my cocktail to a SEVEN course meal that left me so full, I'm definitely coming back if I have the chance!
