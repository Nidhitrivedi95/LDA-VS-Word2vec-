XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q Ok I went to this place because I went to this same restaurant in Monaco when I stayed at the Hotel Metropole when I went there on vacation.  The food was great just as good as in Monaco.

If you go here then you should get the 16 course tasting menu.  I took my mother here for her birthday and 2 of her friends.  

I was a little light headed when I saw the bill lol.  Although just like a place called Alex in vegas, you dont come to these places unless its a special accasion.

Beleive it or not, the hotel, the car rental and the gambling was less then this bill. hahaha.
