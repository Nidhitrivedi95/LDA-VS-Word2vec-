ZrHU8ZzwZQjTRpB1K_8JTQ My girlfriends and I went for dinner and cocktails. We decided to go with appetizers since the dinner menu only offered 4 options. Lamb meatballs were over cooked and cold. The Artisanal meet and cheese platter only offered 4 small pieces of crostini !! We asked for more bread..how were we supposed eat what was offered. A basket of bread cost us $4...really? Don't even think about taking your kids...there's no kid menu. Overall experience was not great, really hope they can turn it around. The plus side...great renovation with nice fixtures.
