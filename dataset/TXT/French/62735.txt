SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ Service was attentive and genuine. Food was surprising and delicious. Bone marrow is a must! Butter Fish and Lamb Chop were yummy. I think the play on the parsnip, kale and lamb chop were my fav. Recommended pairing with the big, bad napa cab was perfect. Chris was great and personable. I'll be back!
