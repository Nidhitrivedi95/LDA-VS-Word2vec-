A couple of things you need to know about La Madeleine.

1.  They are a chain out of Dallas, but not public traded on the market.  Just in case you love and want to invest.

2.  There is an audio of French language lessons in the restrooms.  I seriously felt like I was back in high school.

3.  There is free bread with fresh jam and butter.

4.  The ordering is cafeteria style.

5.  They serve breakfast food all day long.

6.  They cater.

7.  The French Onion soup is the bomb.

8.  The Quiche Lorraine was very fresh and very very yummy.

9.  They have soup, salad, sandwiches, omelets, french toast, croissants, muffins and more.

10.  They great you with Bon Jour.  Like for real.

11.  Prices are between $4.00 and $14.00.  Very affordable.

I think that sums up everything.

Check it out.
