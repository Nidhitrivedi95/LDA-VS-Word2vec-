4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Great views of the strip and the Bellagio fountains! Had an amazing very personable experience with our waiter Bill. He was attentive and charming while answering the millions of questions we had about Vegas. Food was scrumptious! We needed it after the night we had before... we were all still a little foggy. We had a plethora of hair of the dogs cocktails. We tried their bloody marys, screwdrivers, mimosas, moscow mules... all yummy! French onion soup was top notch, Quiche Lorraine and pot pie are all savory and filling. Enjoyed it!
