Yp9w4nhUowBU_IS_StFXbQ Half the excitement of this place is the beauty of the Wynn Hotel and the beautiful outside views. Stopped by for mothers day brunch while in Vegas. Customer service was top notch, shortly after we were seated the waiter brought us a bread platter to die for, My mom opted for some kind of blue cheese bread that was soo good we were lucky we didnt have a basket full of it. Ordered a chilled shrimp option which could have been an entree in and of itself. A little pricey but definitely worth the experience. Will be back
