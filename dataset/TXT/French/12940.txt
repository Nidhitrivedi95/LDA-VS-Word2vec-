4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw We were on a roadtrip and decided to drop by the Vegas Strip for lunch since it was on the way.  When we arrived, we were so surprised there was no line for walk-in (maybe because it was raining).  

Got a table immediately, and our waiter Mr. Manuel provided speedy service.  Ordered our food and enjoyed the complimentary baguette. The dishes were served promptly, and everything was all delicious!!!  

Apparently, Paris Casino charges $7 for 1-4hr parking now!
