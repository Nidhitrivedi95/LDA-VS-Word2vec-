xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g Since posting my review (which I also sent to the restaurant directly), I immediately received a response from the General Manager of the restaurant. She apologized profusely, and is currently communicating with me to better improve the service her staff provides, which is why I'm given the restaurant an additional star, as I am impressed with the speed in which they responded to my comments.
