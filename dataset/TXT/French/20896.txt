AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw This is no Dennys and it is obvious when you walk by and see the price of the menu. This was our first meal after checking in and came for breakfast meeting with my co-workers.  It was very nice inside.  The cooks are visible.  The service was okay.  Had to ask for things instead of them coming regularly.  They told me that their eggs Benedict and quiche are most popular.  I ordered a ham and swiss quiche since it was not something you can find very often. It came with a very small side salad and small tomato.  She asked if I wanted to add potatoes.  I said yes although for the $22 price tag, you'd think they could throw a few on there and it would have sufficed but alas no, it was an extra $5.  Good thing is that the potatoes were hot and tasty and you got a lot.  I couldn't eat them all.  The quiche was thick and quite good.  Some ordered just the regular bacon and eggs and that was $18.  I am giving stars mostly on quality of food.  It was tasty but I would not get any basics as it is quite pricey.  If my quiche just came with a few potatos, I feel it was worth the price.  Otherwise in general it is expensive for breakfast.  However, I have discovered everything at Caesars is expensive so you could easily spend close to the same anywhere else and not get the same quality.  It is definitely a splurge or for those who are used to spending $25-30 for breakfast.
