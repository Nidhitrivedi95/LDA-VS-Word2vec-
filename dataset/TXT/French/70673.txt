Mother Nature crepe: 5 stars
Sugar cane juice: 5 stars
The Mother Nature crepe contains no meat but you will be full by the end of it. It doesn't look like much when you get it, but they definitely did not skimp out on the filling. I vaguely remember my crepe having spinach, avocado, some sort of salty cheese, basil pesto?, and olives. Honestly, it was REALLY good. Their menu isn't very big but they have a lot of good choices for savoury crepes. Sweet crepes have pretty standard options but you can always choose to make your own as well. The crepe itself was crispy on the edges but as you work your way down, it gets soft and chewy. Prices are very fair for what you're getting. The Mother Nature crepe was around $10 and most savoury crepes range from $12-$14? Sweet crepes started at around $6 and up to $10. 
Apparently, their sugar canes are flown in every Friday from Costa Rica! It's $5.99 for a medium-sized cup of sugar cane juice. It only comes in one size. Mint leaves and lemon juice is recommended for your sugar cane juice. It's an extra $0.50 per additional topping. I didn't get it with the mint leaves and lemon juice but I guess I would suggest it since the sugar can juice alone was VERY sweet...duh? Luckily I had a bottle of water with me so I was able to water it down. 

Ambiance: 4 stars
It's a very small shop so take-out is recommended but my friends and I decided to dine in. It's not a very comfortable place to sit and chat for a long time but still nice that there is the option to dine-in. Love the wall mural and all the colours. Chic little crepe place.

Service: 5 stars
Even though it's a small little shop, the gentleman who made our crepe still took the time to come over and see how we were doing with our food. There was also a lady working there and she gave us some recommendations and specialty items they are currently serving. Great people running a great place!
