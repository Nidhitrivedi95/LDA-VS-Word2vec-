0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g A majority of my poor review is due to the fact that we sat next to a table outside that chain smoked cigarettes all night long. When a dinner for 3 is running you over $1k you would think that the chef and restaurant wouldn't want your pallet ruined by the wafting stench of cigarettes through your entire meal. I had the truffle menu which was OK. Other members of my party's selections were phenomenal. I don't think I can ever look at a regular steak the same again after having the Japanese Wagyu Filet.
