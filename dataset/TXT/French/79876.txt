ZrHU8ZzwZQjTRpB1K_8JTQ We tried Stamm House again Friday for the first time since it reopened.  Close, but no cigar.  The food was good (except for the walleye) and the menu has been reworked so that it is much better.  However, the cocktails were weak (no discernible alcohol).  Service was terrible.  Server forgot our salads, and the fish fry was all you could eat; however, good luck getting a refill.  We had trouble getting refills of anything actually and of course the extremely loud acoustics has not been dealt with and should be.  My ears are still ringing. I hope the owners can pull this together because it is a beautiful location but they are not there yet.
