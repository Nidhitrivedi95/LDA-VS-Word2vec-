htQgj-ANQpZGpIpkkrEmyQ From the lunch menu I had the Pork Belly sandwich for $13. It was great, however I would have preferred the baguette to be a little thinner so I could taste more of the pork and less of the bread. I upgraded my side of fries to pulled pork frites for an extra $2... an exceptional value IMO. The pork was delicious and was topped with a shallot aioli and potato haystack. Next time I'm going to try the duck confit frites for an extra $4. Wife had the $15 Korean sandwich (which I had on my previous visit) and the dish still impresses.
