rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A This review is based on Brunch visits.  I cannot wait to try Lunch/Dinner sometime soon!

4.5 Stars.  Thomas Keller does not dissapoint here with dishes that make you buckle.  This is his "affordable" and easier to get into establishment.

FIRST, SKIP the coffee!  The only disappointment here.  Maybe I don't know what French coffee is supposed to be like but DAMN!  This thing is like......crude oil.  Its thick, bitter, dark flavor just got worse and worse with every sip.  Nor was it hot hot, just above warm.  Don't even do it, or you'll remember I told you so.

Now.....

- Vaunted Chicken n Waffles was ridiculous.  The roast chicken 1/2 dark 1/2 white was just succulent, moist, flavorful, perfect.  This dish was most likely the cause of a longer wait holding up rest of our dishes, probably because they were handpicking which poor chicken's time were up.  The gravy was good (think it had bacon in it or ham), but not necessary as the chicken was just delicious.  The Waffles as others noted are not your everyday waffles.  They were sweet yet sour, crispy yet soft.  It took a few bites to get used to the uniquness and am still unsure whether I liked it or not.  But it doesn't matter because the chicken was very good.  Not a huge serving of chicken, but the whole entree was filling enough.  

-  Brioche French Toast was delicate, meltful (I love making up words), fragile, beautifully done.  The Vanilla Bean butter and syrup went perfect with the blueberries.  I'd order this everytime we come here.  

- The special Chocolate Almond Croissant.....the moment it hits your lips, you're done.  The exterior look is nothing special, but once you bite, once your tooth hits the pastry, your saliva glands explode.  Nuff said.

- Table Bread was meh.  Skippable.  Don't waste stomach space on this.

Service was strong.  Not stellar, but strong.  Water/coffee filling was often.  One server was too busy and less attentive, another was super friendly and alot of pleasant sweet eye contact.

In Vegas, there are so many restaurants to try that every visit you plan different spots to try.  Bouchon at the Venetian is one that will always be considered for every visit, just make sure to skip the coffee.  Yikes.
