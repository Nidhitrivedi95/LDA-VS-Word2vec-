fyJAqmweGm8VXnpU4CWGNw Why has it taken me so long to review French Grocery?!?! This place is truly a gem and a terrific addition to the neighborhood. Everything I've eaten here has been terrific: macaron parisien , out of this world (I've taken them to several parties and they are always a smash); muffuletta sandwich, divine; French bread, fantastic; beignets, awesome; praline bacon, heavenly (and I scored a free order by flashing my bacon tattoo). Their selection of cheeses is pretty good, too. The grab-n-go sandwiches have been a wonderful change to my normal work lunch, at about half the cost of eating out downtown.
