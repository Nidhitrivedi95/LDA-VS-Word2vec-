When I visited I had the beef stew, which was really tasty and a good portion for lunch. 

However, this place is overpriced. I ordered a glass of wine on a whim and it turns out, HA(!), it was $12. And it was just white wine. Nothing fancy. 
(perhaps that was my bad, but still). 

This place is a good one to take someone to on a first date, because there is enough showy stuff (whispy tents, high pouring tea and bellydancers) to distract you (or your date) if things aren't going well.
