SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ I love coming to HoT, they're food is delicious and the atmosphere is even better. The best part about House of Tricks is my favorite waitress, Sarah, who always gives the best wine recommendations, is really friendly and really cares about your experience. HoT goes above and beyond to make sure you have a great dining experience.
