xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g This was a last minute decision for a birthday dinner and wow can I say it was amazing. I ordered the short ribs. Perfectly done! The alcohol selection was great and the service at the bar wonderful. It is definitely spendy...but worth the money if you feel like divulging yourself in an expensive meal. Service in general was great and the view from the restaurant was the icing on the cake!
