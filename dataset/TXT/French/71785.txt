Went here for dinner with friends on a Friday night and we were so surprised to see it packed!  We waited for about 45 minutes for a table.  Come early!  And do not expect to be seated in a large group of people, it's far too small for that.  

Don't order appetizers-they are far too small and far too expensive.  We ordered the mussels thinking there would be a pound for our group of 4 to share.  Instead, there were 5 mussels total.  Yes, 5 pieces.  They were tasty, but we were shocked when we saw the plate.  

We ordered the crepe special for dinner which was a chicken and mango stuffed crepe in a tarragon cream sauce.  Our crepes did not have any mango in it, but it did have plenty of chicken and the sauce was really delicious.  Hubby ordered seafood pasta.  Meh was the answer.  

Dessert was...meh.  We ordered one creme brulee and one crepe.  Maybe we ordered the wrong thing?  

So overall, just a meh experience.  I would go back however just to try the desserts because everyone else on yelp is saying they're amazing...I dunno.  Someone tell me which dessert to order!
