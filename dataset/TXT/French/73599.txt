xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g Came here for lunch on a Tuesday and we're seated by the window with a great view.    My husband and I shared foie gras pate and French BLT tower.   
The foie was very creamy and delicious.   The BLT sandwich with fresh avocado was excellent.  Good quality green tea. Excellent service.  Nice atmosphere.  The next time we will try for dinner.
