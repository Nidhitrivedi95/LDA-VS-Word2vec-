w2tr0PA0b3tg8pId0kjM-A I've only had the macarons, but they keep bringing me back! Some flavors get a little sweet, but overall they offer a nice variety and the flavors match their description. The chocolate macarons are rich but not overpowering. The nougatine/honey I tried was on the sweet side, but still very flavorful. They have been fresh every time, with the right amount of chew and crisp. 
The shop is clean, the staff is fairly friendly, and the decor is inviting.
Gaby et Jules is on the pricey side if you want to try a bunch of macarons, but the quality is good. I've also found that a small box of different flavors make a very nice gift! (All macaron recipients have been delighted.)
