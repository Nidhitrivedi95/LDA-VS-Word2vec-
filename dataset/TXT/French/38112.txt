JezHN-9KKLTMbojq00VP0g Le Petit Triangle Cafe is such a cute place. It is small, not overly simple, and sort of quaint. The chef whistles to the French music playing in the small open kitchen, the menu and its prices are proportional to the size of the cafe, and on a good-weathered day you can sit outside. Good service and really great atmosphere.

The food itself is not bad at all, although I think it falls short of being special. It's still good enough that I would go back. Prices are quite reasonable as well, generally ranging from $8-12. (I was there for brunch, I don't think we saw their dinner menu). Within my party, we ordered a salmon omelette (tastiest, but actually quite salty), croissant ham, egg & brie sandwich (not bad), "fit" omelette and a crepe of which kind i cannot remember. portions are just enough, not too scant or bountiful.

The overall consensus on the food was "okay," but it was still a really lovely brunch.
