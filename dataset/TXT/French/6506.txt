4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw WHOA!!! DO NOT BELIEVE WHAT YOU READ!!!
This restaurant is supposed to be one of the best on the Strip.  I suppose it is if it is your only dining experience ever.  For those of you who like or even love steak, head to a real steak house!

We booked a large party and the setting is quite lovely.  You will not be seated unless the majority of your party arrives.  The service is professional and seemingly friendly, but the food is "meh."

Our group ordered the gamut of items.  Some of us shared the mushroom appetizer which was a bit juvenile.  The presentation was nice, but the thick cream and mushroom combination was overwhelming.  

We also shared a caesar salad but, that too, was uneventful.  There were fried, cubed potatoes which was a "psyche" moment because I was hoping for crispy croutons to add texture and taste.
I also ordered the scallops which, had there not been the sliced leek accompaniment, would have been good.  

I tried a bit of my friend's bone-in rib eye.  I eat rib eye ALL THE TIME and found this preparation to be chewy and tasteless...a TOTAL disappointment especially since this is a steak frites restaurant.

All-in-all, I was saddened by the entire dining experience.  Had we not been seated near the window so we could watch the Bellagio water feature, this would have been a complete fail.  SPEND YOUR MONEY ELSEWHERE!
