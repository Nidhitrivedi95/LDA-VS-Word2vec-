4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw We took our parents to Vegas and to Mon Ami Gabi for my mom's 70th birthday. Based on the reviews, we were looking forward to a good steak dinner. We ordered the standard "steak" which was probably a cheap tough steak pounded thin to make it tender but we still had a lot of tough pieces that had to be left on the plate. My mom ordered hers cooked medium and it came out well done and dry. The rest of us ordered medium rare and we got medium well but at least it was more edible than our mom's. The only thing nice was that they brought a little cream puff dessert for my mom since it was her birthday, which was stated on the reservation. And because we had a reservation, we got a seat by the window which was nice. The waitress was not very attentive, almost ignored us, compared to other waiters in the place. We ordered appetizers, red wine and cocktails so it was not a cheap dinner. Overall it was disappointing since it did not live up to other reviews. Service was mediocre at best.. I would not recommend this restaurant and I would not go back there. That goes for all of us that were there that night.
