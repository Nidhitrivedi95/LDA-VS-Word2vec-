0JGMKaKJGVuDus5WcJzvjw As the sister restaurant to Joe Beef this was a massive disappointment.  The chef suffered from bad technique and lack of imagination.  We ordered the chili and tripe and the meat was noticeably overcooked to the point of tasting burnt.  Two dishes with Rabbit were littered with bone fragments and way overcooked. All of the dishes were bland--even by British standards.
