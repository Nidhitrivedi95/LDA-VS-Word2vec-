ysJo5Jdo29XOBCnKrbUKWg I've been looking for a tasty macarons place as I'm new to the area. I loved that when my friend and I walked in all the staff was speaking French and the atmosphere was quaint and charming.

I like that you have to ask the macaroon flavor which means their baked fresh daily. I ended up getting a sampler of all 6 flavors to take home. Pistachio is a constant favorite of mine. Although I was blown away by the black and yellow macaroon. I can't remember what exactly he said it's made of but I remember my taste buds were delightfully surprised. 

I'm definitely going to go back and have afternoon coffee here.
