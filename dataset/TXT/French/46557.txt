The two $$ on Yelp did not steer us wrong - Restaurant Chantecler has a great quality to price ratio... probably the best value I've seen in Toronto. Three of us shared oysters, steak tartare, 12oz steak & marrow, fries, a salmon spread that isn't on the menu, and a cheeseboard for desert. It was a bit too much food, the waiter kind of pressured us to order more even though our original order would probably have been perfect. Fortunately it was all delicious and we didn't leave any leftovers. The marrow was the only portion I was indifferent towards. The cheese board is definitely something I would never have ordered on my own - but it was fantastic. Great atmosphere too!
