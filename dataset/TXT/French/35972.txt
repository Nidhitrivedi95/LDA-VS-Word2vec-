hvjgF-vnPw2jyL5DBuB0qg I was vacationing in Montreal last summer and knew I wanted to check out Garde Manger. I was able to get a reservation for the Saturday night we were in town at 8:30. 

We arrived and were promptly seated in a huge corner booth. Since I was with my brother and his friend we decided to try a lot of different dishes. My review is a bit overdue, so I don't remember entirely what we ordered but I do remember the lobster poutine and oysters. Both were really good!

I would recommend Garde Manger. The service was great and the restaurant has a nice ambiance.
