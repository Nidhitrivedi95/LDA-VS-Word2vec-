Started off my meal with a taquila cocktail at the bar, which was very unique and expertly prepared.  Had the onion soup which was excellent, though very mild which will appeal to some more than others.  Also, had a chance to try the sea bass.  The pistachio coating provided a unique sweet flavor that was perfect with the light flavored fish.

They also have an interesting wine club system where they allow you to bring your own wine if you join the club.  Great way to make this a BYOB place for a reasonable cost.
