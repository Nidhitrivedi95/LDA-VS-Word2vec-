xNnZ5ksBY1gwwTV2Btb4Ag If all vegetarian dishes tasted like the ones we had here, I would turn Vegetarian.
(relax, that's not happening anytime soon)

If you're a real foodie and planning a trip to Montreal soon - this is a must. MUST.
In the plateau area (hip, trendy 'hood).

Ate horse. Horse tataki to be exact. It was yum.
The wine menu, the cocktail menu, the food menu, the wait staff - all amazing. 
Wonderful atmosphere (gorgeous lighting in case you care).

Even their bathrooms are stunning.

Love. Will go back.
