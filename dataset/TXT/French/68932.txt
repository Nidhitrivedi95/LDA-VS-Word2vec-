VwZhwflLnTq19aAeFLJHCQ Like many others, I drove by the 'Bernard's Opening Soon' sign for what seemed like months, and thought... Oh, another doomed restaurant, as so many before had come and gone.

But it finally opened!  Yay, a new place in the 'hood.

We have now had dinner there twice, and both times have enjoyed the food and service.  The staff is VERY welcoming and seem genuinely happy you are there.  Both times we have had excellent service, and they were more than helpful and accommodating with a food allergy request.

We have tried:
Ahi appetizer - excellent, and the presentation was great.  It was the first time I have seen the dipping sauce in an egg shell - cool. 
Bufala Mozzarella Caprese - unfortunately not made with buffalo mozzarella, but the group thought it was very good.
Fish and Chips - very light and tasty batter on the fish, great skinny onion rings, typical fries, and to mix it up, battered veggies.  The fry cook had a good read on most everything.
Chinois Chicken Salad -  Husband loved it.  Lots of different flavors, good dressing - not heavy, but enough of it.  Says he would order it again.
NY Steak - just ok, decent but probably would not order it again.
Chicken Milanese - again ok, but huge!  The side of spaghetti was excellent, made me wish I had just ordered a plate of pasta.

Dessert - cake; a chocolate piece of chocolate and more chocolate - they said it was delicious.
A frozen peach hollowed out and filled with sorbet, again going out of their way to cater to an allergy - it was awesome.  

To top the night off, Chef Bernard came out and sang Happy Birthday to me!
Usually, I would have crawled under the table at this point, but he sang with his French accent and who can resist him?! It was great!
