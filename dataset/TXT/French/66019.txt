Superb wings as an appetizer; great mushroom bisque soup, though a bit flour-y for my tastes.  My dining partner reported the fish was as fresh as could be and, like every Bruell restaurant, there was no scrimping on the bread supply, which is refreshing for such a 5-star destination.

Another departure: the waiter actually suggested a cheaper Tempranillo not on the wine list, saying they were considering adding it.  At $26/per, I'd vote yea.

Cowell & Hubbard shows The Cleve as the happening place it can be.
