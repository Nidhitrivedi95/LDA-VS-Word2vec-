xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g This was my first time going to The Eiffel Tower Restuarant and I've got to admit I was very impressed. The amazing view over looking their impression of Paris and the rest of Vegas was mesmerizing. The Staff was very attentive and accommodating. The food was mouth watering from the appetizers to the entrées to the amazing soufflé dessert that came in many delicious flavors. I will definitely be coming back here again and I highly recommend everyone to make a reservation and check it out!
