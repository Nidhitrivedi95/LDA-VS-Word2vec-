WOd8tWsh2Yt_osHv-ngx_w I've been here a few times and it never fails to satisfy me! The breakfast is delicious and are extremely large portions. I've been here twice for dinner also, one time I had a burger which was cooked to a perfect medium and was delicious and the other time I had a salmon salad that was amazing! Not too heavy on the dressing and really large. Every time I've been I've been seated very quickly, received great service, and had a timely meal. 
This restaurant really knows what they're doing and does their job very well. The menu is very large and it seems like whatever you order you're going to receive a large amount of very delicious and filling food.
