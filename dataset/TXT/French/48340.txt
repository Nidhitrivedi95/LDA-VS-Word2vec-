Came here for a professional meeting. Not sure if we had the regular menu, or a revised one which had fewer options, but there was still a variety to choose from

Food:
Zucchini soup: a little texture in the soup with a little kick, which I loved. Not too salty.
Beef tenderloin: perfect for me. Not too chewy, not overcooked. The roasted potatoes tasted a little weird to me. I can't pinpoint exactly what it was, but it left a slight bitter after taste, but still edible.
Pineapple ginger jelly with cream cheese for dessert: I was not a fan. The cream cheese was super thick and flavor was way too strong, the texture of the jelly was very dense. I think I was expecting more of a jello consistency.

Service:
Awesome. We had the whole room downstairs to ourselves.  So we were offered wine right when we got in. Waiters came around to take our order not long after we sat down. The only thing was that when they were refilling our wine glasses, they kept spilling on the table, and on my dish. I guess that's really nothing to be complaining about.

Atmosphere:
Beautiful there. There was a waterfall in our room on the main floor, which would be perfect for a date. However we were there for a conference, which made it a little hard for the speakers to hear the audience. The room was very spacious. Definitely enough room to connect and mingle. I think it is usually open for regular dining too. So hopefully, you go on a night when there are no meetings, so you can enjoy the mini waterfall too.
