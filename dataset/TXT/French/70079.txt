wV5IYyqc35F1g3fSZjt41A We stopped here on our way to Mont Tremblant. The food and service were definitely 5 stars. My husband had lasagna and I had one of the mussel dishes. Both were excellent. They had buffalo mozzarella caprese on the menu which was surprising and delicious. For dessert we had the nutella banana creme brûlée which was out of this world. Our server was friendly and attentive. 

However, I'd give it 3 stars for atmosphere. It was loud. I had to concentrate hard to listen to my husband who was sitting right across from me. There was a speaker right above our head and the changing lights were really distracting. There were a lot of people eating there, too which added to the noise. I saw some panels on the ceiling that looked possibly like noise absorbing things...but they didn't seem to be doing much - especially when the restaurant adds in music on top of the already loud din. 

So between the 5 for food and service and 3 for atmosphere - it averages to a 4. We would definitely go back, but maybe not at peak dining time.
