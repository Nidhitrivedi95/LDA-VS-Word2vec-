P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ We enjoyed a wonderful dinner at the 5pm seating so we would have enough time to see Celine Dion at 7:30pm. We selected the prestige tasting menu and wine pairing. To keep it short, service and conversation was impeccable. I do not usually delight in loud and rambunctious restaurants where you have to shout to hear each other so we really enjoyed the ambiance.  We had a great view of the Paris hotel Eiffel Tower.  Presentation of the food is unique and a bit more modern than traditional french restaurants. I would recommend to keep an open mind, open palate and prepare for a marathon. If you are attending a show at the Colosseum I would recommend ordering from the carte menu or checking if a shorter version of the tasting menus are possible as we tried to go a bit fast and finished right around 7pm. They also send you home with tasty 'homemade' chocolates.
