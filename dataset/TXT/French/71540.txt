XcWlBj5oQgzKhR7Cxovj3w Not sure what this restaurant thinks it is but not fine dining at all. Inspect to pay more for food and drinks in an airport, but this is airport prices inside an airport.  Paid $17 for a double jack and Coke and was pretty watered down.  Go down past C13 for better dining.  This place charges twice what you'd expect.
