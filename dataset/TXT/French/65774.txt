uBXEI3Vq8ZSQkhkgN5z6aQ We came here for dinner when were visiting and staying in the neighborhood. It is quite small, and staff is very friendly. They also explained some menu items as we did not speak French. The food was absolutely amazing, and so affordable! We loved the food so much that when we were leaving on Monday morning we stopped again for breakfast! I would definitely come back again and would recommend to all!
