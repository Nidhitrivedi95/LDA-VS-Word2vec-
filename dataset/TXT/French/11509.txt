4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Good selection of wine, I had their Fillet Mignon, several bottles of wine, and a nice Sorbet desert.

Their food is very tasty (Too many fries, would love to see other side dishes "included"), and it is right across from the Bellagio so you can see the water shows from your table.

Overall, it was a great experience, the lighting is very dark and moody so great for intimate dinners, and the fountain show always adds something to the experience.
