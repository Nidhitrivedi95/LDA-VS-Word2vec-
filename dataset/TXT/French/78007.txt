YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g Greatest meal I have ever had! The story goes like this....I had a fantastic burger at Fluer for lunch and as a joke I said to the waitress "my compliments to Chef Keller" knowing that this is just one of those chef owned chains and the celebrity chef is never there.... Flash forward 10 hours later. So it is around 10pm and I'm bored at Mandalay bay and I walk by Fluer and I notice someone at the bar (the place is closed) and guess who it is... Hubert Keller! I proceeded to tell him how I didn't think that celebrity chefs actually worked at their restaurants and how I really enjoyed my lunch at his restaurant. He proceeded to tell me he actually cooked my hamburger! He then asked me if I would join him for a glass of wine... So there we were just me and Chef Keller enjoying a wine and having a great conversation.... He then asks me what I have planned for dinner the next evening and I tell him that I have a reservation for a big party at another restaurant and he says "no no no I am going to cook for you tomorrow night" he then calls over the manager and puts me down for a reservation for 20!....When I tell you we had the greatest dining experience of all of our lives... I am telling you the gods honest truth and true to his word Chef Keller cooked every course and came out to explain every course to our party!! At the end Hubert invited a few of us to visit his kitchen and gave us signed cookbooks!! Absolutely amazing!! As a side note I eat all over the world and Fluer is the best!! Please go and when you say "my compliments to the chef" Chef Keller may be there to thank you! Bravo Chef Keller, Bravo!!
