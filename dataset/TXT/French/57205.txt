rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Like a lot of people, I tried this place based on the reputation of Thomas Keller and the French Laundry. I once cooked an appetizer out of the French Laundry cookbook, and once I was done with the tomato confit, chive oil, and tomato powder a simple appetizer took about five hours to make. Those are the details that make Keller's restaurants special; an exacting and intense devotion to technique and quality. 
Four or five meals here so far, every one exceptional. Recommend the Mussels and steak frites, the croque madame and all the baked goods.
A little pricey, but lunch is reasonable, and during the week usually not busy. If you just want to try the pastries, the Bouchon Bakery downstairs in the Venetian is a great quick stop. The little round sugared doughnuts filled with jam are a particular favorite, if available. Also really good macaroons.
