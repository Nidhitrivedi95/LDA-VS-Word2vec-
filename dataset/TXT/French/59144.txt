rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w I know this review will seem out of place but here we go:

Pro's:

- Great Ambience
- Great view of fountains
- Amazing service
- Foie Gras was impeccable 
- Chocolate Martini was best my wife ever had

Con's:

- Fish was under done and in some weird potato crust that was not good
- Lobster and Avocado salad was boring and flavorless
- Lamb was also boring and flavorless
- Creme Brulee was bland and not good

I don't mind paying good money for a great dinner experience, but at $437 for both of us it was a huge disappointment.
