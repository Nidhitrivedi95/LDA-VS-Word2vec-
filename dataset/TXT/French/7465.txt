4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I had the Chicken Pate appetizer ($12) and their Jumbo Crab cake ($18)...was not impressed. I actually didn't see anything that really stood out to me, however, my girlfriend order filet mignon with a piece of butter like spread on top and that was delicious! The meat was very tender and the spread just topped it off. 

I gave it a 3 stars because the other dishes were good. Mine, not so much.

For starters, they give you a long piece of baguette with some butter. I thought that was ok also. And I LOVE bread. This bread was ehhhh.
