XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q Limo service, VIP entrance through the mansion... 16 course meal at Jöel's began with much promise.

Yes, it was 3 hrs plus dinner - Easily the longest meal for us the short attention span, MTV generation. But the visual excitement of each dish, savoring confluence of flavors, attentive service and the luxurious decór made the whole experience enjoyable. Even the bread & dessert cart were cute!

Now, my beef? I would have ordered chocolate soufflé if I had that choice in dessert. For the price of $xxx per person, you would think that would be the case. But by the time dessert rolled over - after like 15 plates - does it really matter what is in front of you? Maybe not. 

At the end of this enjoyable dinner, we were presented with a summary of menu wrapped in purple sash ribbon marking the occassion and a delightful parting gift in... was it in a purple/ lilac bag? Yes, I get it. Monsieur Robuchon likes purple! ~.~

Can't wait till next time I am in Vegas to try more dishes at Jöel Robuchon!
