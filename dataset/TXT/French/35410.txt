htQgj-ANQpZGpIpkkrEmyQ Good food, great and quick service. We went for lunch during a weekday and so it wasn't very busy. Nice and clean place. I thought menu was slightly overpriced for lunch menu but was defiantly worth it and so filling. Would come again! Highly recommend the squid burger if your a fan of seafood.
