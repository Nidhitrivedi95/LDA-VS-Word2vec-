xaqW4NkmUCGRRjmLxiFJ6Q The day we decided to give Muncheez a try was on a rainy day. We decided to make the drive over based on all the reviews. 

It is a very small cafe with high tables along one side of the wall. Friendly and welcoming when you enter, the premises look very pleasing and you see all the fresh ingredients. We were seated at a nice comfortable table inside the restaurant. While we waited for our food, we watched our crepes being cooked. 

We ordered a New York's own savoury crepe and a Paradise sweet crepe.  I liked the crispness of both crepes. The savoury crepe gets a 5* rating for the taste combination and food quality. The sweet crepe gets a 3.5, well I also make sweet crepes at home and ours was a bit dry. 

Our overall experience rating dropped to a 2.5-3* when we were asked by a staff? if we would move to a smaller table which was beside the garbage bin and just inside of the entrance of the cafe, so that he could accommodate another party that arrived later. 
That action I think you can only ask your family to move to another table because you want to impress and make your paying clientele comfortable, but to ask other cafe clientele to move? I can't say what would have appeased me...perhaps offer me a comp tea while I sit close to the door. It can be that simple. After they moved us, and we got our food, they left us on our own. Service finito. 

Then as we were leaving, the same staff asked how did we hear about this place, and we had Yelped. He asked us to write a review on Yelp!
