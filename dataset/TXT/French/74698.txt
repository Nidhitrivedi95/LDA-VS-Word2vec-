I went to the bathroom as I waited for some of my party to arrive. Inside the bathroom, there's another lady who leads you to a stall. After you finish washing your hands, she gives you a pretty towel with the Eiffel Tower Restaurant Logo.

Anyways, we get seated and a waiter begins to recommend dishes for you. You can feel the professionalism of the atmosphere and everything is in tip-top shape.

We Ordered:
1. Duck Breast
2. Beef Wellington
3. Grilled Salmon
4. Rabbit with a light Mustard sauce
5. Beef Tenderloin
6. Escargot
7. Duck Liver
8. Chocolate Souffle
9. Strawberry Souffle

The appetizer that comes is a spinach soup I believe. Anyways, the presentation was amazing and they serve you bread. The outside view of the Bellagio fountains were amazing too.
