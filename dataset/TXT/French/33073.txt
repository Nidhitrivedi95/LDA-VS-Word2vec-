He5snolA_enC5_7JjurQ3A This is a nice little place, very cozy, with the French inspired cuisine.
The lady who served our table was very friendly and pleasant, and made the whole experience enjoyable.
We had a coupon for 4, so what we paid was adequate to the quality of food. The full prices are rather steep though.
We ordered escargot and french onion soup as appetizers, and were a little disappointed. Fried calamari was a better choice. 
Seafood for a  main course was good but a little heavy on the stomach, with cream based sauces, so wouldn't order the same dish again. My son had a schnitzel, which was okay.
The best part was crapes with whipped cream and raspberry sauce.  Delicious.
We didn't have to do a reservation, and were sited immediately when we came around 5:30 - 6 pm on Sunday, however by 7:30 pm the room was full. I recommend you make a reservation if coming after 6.
