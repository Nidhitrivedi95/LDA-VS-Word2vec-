ovtlrcsVRlgZZQUlHs_ovw Worst meal we have ever encountered. The duck looked like a dry, overcooked chicken leg. The taste was awful with the flavor of recooked, old chicken. The potato slices were hard and beyond crisp to the point of burnt.  The meatloaf had a burnt crust on it. Seemed to have been sitting in the broiler a long time. The vegetables were limp and soggy.
There was nothing positive about this experience. I knew we were in trouble when the hostess asked in a nasty manner, "do you have a reservation?". The place was at best half full. Our seat was about 1 foot away from our neighbor and we could have had a 4 way conversation. 
Yes, we could have gotten another meal but after waiting a long time who wants to wait for another bad meal!
We will never return nor will will recommend it to anyone. The one star is for available parking.
