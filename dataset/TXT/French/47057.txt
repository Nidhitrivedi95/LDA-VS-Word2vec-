nXlKHnArL3_vugmnytsEYQ They are testing out the restaurant at this location and moved the deli market down to the Strip.  Right now, its open 3 days a week, but considering opening a 4th day a week.  We came here for Valentines day dinner a day early to beat the craziness.  The couple next to us gave us some suggestions of what they liked, which we took.  To start, we had the half Charcuterie board and shared a salad that was a daily special.  It was a nice arugula salad with a pancetta vinaigrette dressing and a sunny side up egg on top.  Very nice start.  For our mains, we shared the Duck Confit Crepes which was soooo delicious.  As well as the Chicken Roulade which was such a surprise!  We would not have ordered this dish had it not been for the couple next to us.  We were so glad we listened.  It was rich and flavorful, had such great texture, and was different than most things you see in restaurants around here.  We were stuffed at the end but we made enough room for the poached pears in coffee with homemade pistachio ice cream.  The whole meal was excellent.  The service was great.  Will definitely be back!  Part of me wants to keep it a secret, but I want them to do well and open a 4th day.
