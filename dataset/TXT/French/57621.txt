rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A This review only covers breakfast/brunch, we've never been to Bouchon for Dinner.  

This is _THE_ place to have breakfast in Las Vegas, hands-down.  The atmosphere is great, indoors and out. The service is exceptional, and the food is incredible.  We've had the bread pudding french toast, the waffles, the waffles and fried chicken, the corned beef hash, the omelettes and a few other items from the menu over the course of our 10+ visits.  Each item is exceptional, and dare I say, best-of-class.  This is the only place we insist on eating in Las Vegas almost every morning we're in town.
