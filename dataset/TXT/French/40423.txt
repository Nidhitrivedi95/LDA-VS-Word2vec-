KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA The Las Vegas restaurant options are plentiful and sometimes overwhelming.  You can always go to the strip and get something that is pretty good, but incredibly overpriced and you have to deal with some interesting people on your way to the restaurant.  If you are like me and live in Las Vegas and don't want to deal with the strip every time you would like a nice meal this is a restaurant you should try.  Their wine selection is great and their food even better.

My husband and I ordered their beef tenderloin, duck, and a side of their mash potatoes.  All were delicious, and the been tenderloin truly melted in your mouth.  (All restaurants always claim their tenderloin will melt in your mouth, but few actually succeed.)  The outside patio, on the lake, was charming and the staff was excellent.  There was live music and I loved how the restaurant's noise level was very low compared to some of the other fine dinning establishments we have visited.

Check this place out, you won't be disappointed.
