JezHN-9KKLTMbojq00VP0g This is the perfect date spot. Great service, interesting menu, and I've always had excellent food (and they give you plenty of it).

Most reviews on here mention brunch but my experience has been two dinners. 

I won't give many 5-star reviews but each time I've been here I've really enjoyed it.
