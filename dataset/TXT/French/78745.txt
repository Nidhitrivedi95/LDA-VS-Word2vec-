ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug We have been here for breakfast and dinner (x2).  Who your server team is makes a difference!  Alfredo was excellent. His team was attentive and on the spot for service. I forget my breakfast team but she was amazing.  

For our second dinner, Rey and Wilson seemed distracted and overworked! I suspect they are good, however we felt ignored and our plates stayed on our table way to long after we were done. Rey seems nice and tried to make up for it, however a little to late.  Food took way to long!

Food was good, make sure they know that you want your meat medium rare not medium.

Cheesecake came with the special... Delicious!
