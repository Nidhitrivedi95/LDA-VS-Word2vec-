fNCyfJOfd2R42hkhz2tALQ Last meal before departing my 24 hour stay in Montreal and of course, leave it to the Americans to end up at a steak and fries joint. 

It's obvious what their specialty was but I wanted to try somthing different. A local told me they are big on duck here so I opted for the duck confit. It was good but a bit on the dry side. I like my meat more tender and juicy. 

As far as the appetizers, calamari and escargo were good. 

Next time, I'll just stick to what the sign says and get steak and fries.
