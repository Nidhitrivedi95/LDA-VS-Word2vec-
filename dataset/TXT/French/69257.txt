w2tr0PA0b3tg8pId0kjM-A Gaby Et Jules is exactly what one should expect of a good French bakery!  The atmosphere is spot on.  Clean, small, lovely, and you can see the full kitchen and chefs baking away behind glass.  It's just wonderful. Onto the desserts...

DIVINE!  I purchased an assortment of delicacies for my holiday party, from macarons to tiny tarts and pufed pastries.  Everything was delish and decorated beautifully.  

My only critique is the price.  Yes, the items are specialty, but $3+ per macaron (unless you buy in bulk, b/c the price does go down) is a bit steep. $7 avg. per pastry?  I mean, this is still Pittsburgh.  These prices rival NYC.  Macarons are such a fad dessert right now that people forget that they aren't incredibly difficult to make, and the ingredients are pretty inexpensive.  That being said, they were very good... just overpriced in my opinion.

Overall, c'est magnifique! (I couldn't resist.)
