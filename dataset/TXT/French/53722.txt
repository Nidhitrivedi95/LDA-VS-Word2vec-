qmh6zxtJ8C8-YiUPv7ySlw It's 5:30 AM, I have just walked back to the hotel and I'm hungry as hell.  Not ready to go to the room and definitely not chugging anymore money in a machine.  So, I happen across this restaurant, cool beans.  I grab a seat at the bar, while watching the folks stumbling in from wherever they had been partying at.  Way too funny.  I have never seen so many women with mascara running down their faces, walking sideways, totally a scene out of a bad movie.  

Anyway, the bartenders start to chat with me, make some recommendations about the menu selections,  I settled on a French Toast swirl variation and a Mimosa.  Good night cap I think.  LOL!!!

The meal was heavenly, I am happily nourished now and ready for some zzzz's.  Great to find they were open and available for me to have something other than a greasy slice of pizza, hot dog or hamburger.  Yum Yum.
