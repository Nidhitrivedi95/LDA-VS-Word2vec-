aaWhSHpsE285eaSTzDxAMA Went for a quick lunch with some business associates and it was delightful!  Had the Bistro 185 salad with grilled chicken and while nothing extraordinary about the ingredients, it was a pleasure to have a salad prepared with such fresh ingredients and ratios (not too much or too little of anything!).

Hope to come back soon and explore more of the menu!

Only issue was parking - not enough!
