rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw I was sad to see Michael Mina's American Fish close, but was more than assuaged after eating at Bardot. 

The restaurant is beautiful--completely redone to go with the French brasserie theme with plenty of painted wood paneling, brass, Mercury glass, and detailing. All those hard surfaces result in a super noisy restaurant, but it's pretty to look at!

Bardot is open for brunch 10:00-2:00 on the weekends only, and dinner every day at 5:00. They offer happy hour with food and drink specials each night til 7:00 in the bar. 

Loved the smoke and mirrors cocktail, with the sweet balanced out by the smoke. 

My favorite thing, which was ordered as an afterthought, was the beet salad. A beautiful presentation, and it's even tastier than it looks. Lightly grilled goat cheese, hazelnut oil...mmmm. 

Pretty restaurant, pretty food, pretty people...must be Vegas!
