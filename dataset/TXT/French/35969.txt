hvjgF-vnPw2jyL5DBuB0qg I was really looking forward to experience this restaurant . Reservations are hard to get and I was super excited when my date and I were accommodated last minute for the first seating. The staff is super nice and the decor is cozy and trendy. We were really disappointed with the meal. The foie gras appetizer with blueberries was delicious but the piece was very small and the brioche on which it was served was too large and hidden by salad so it felt like you were having brioche with a taste of the foie gras. My Stake Diane had delicious sauce with pickled celery but the meat quality was too hard and fibrous. Our other meal was Cod, very nicely presented, a nice portion of good fish however both meals were way too salty and left us quite disappointed . Once we left the restaurant we had to immediately search for sorbet to cleanse the palate.. It's a great place to have a drink and oysters for the ambiance and service,  perhaps not for foodies.
