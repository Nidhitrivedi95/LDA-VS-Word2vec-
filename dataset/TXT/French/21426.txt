B56AYe5GNuavMDtwFsXqzA Went for lunch with my family - my wife and I both ordered salad nicoise and tasted  the food ordered by our kids - croque monsieur, the burger, and french fries (pomme frites). We both agreed that the salad was the best. We ordered it with salmon filet (chicken is also an option) and it was cooked perfectly - crusty on the outside while moist on the inside. The other salad ingridients complemented the salmon very well. For desert we ordered beignets which were served with a kind of chocolate sauce which the kids loved. Overall it was a nice lunch.
