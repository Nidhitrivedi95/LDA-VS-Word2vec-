lQ9VmIWvM6v-rONPkYX8aQ Not much to say beyond the 5 stars here.  The food is solid and so is the service.  The mini couch for my purse was a nice touch and the restaurant is one of the more opulent I have seen.  Dollar for Dollar I prefer Gary Danko in San Francisco, but I can pretty confidently say that about every meal I've had on the strip.  A good experience overall and didn't disappoint even at this price point.
