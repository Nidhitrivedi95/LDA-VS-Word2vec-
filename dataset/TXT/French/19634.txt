aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw The chocolate Bouchon ($1.75) super rich but not bad for the price, cheese danish:  very buttery and flaky but a little more pricey @ $4 but what do you expect @ the Venetian hotel, on the strip and "Bouchon" for the most part.  Sm. coffee ($3) and Stroong.  You definitely get what you pay for and if you're a guest @ the Venetian this is the best place to get a quick pastry and cup of coffee as it is conveniently located near the guest elevators.  **there's no tables or chairs so either bring it back to your room or take it out to the 4th floor and enjoy it poolside =)
