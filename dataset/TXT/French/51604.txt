I actually took a friend here after seeing that they'd revamped their menu with a tilt towards tapas.  It used to be they would carry full sized pizzas and a select number of elaborate (and expensive) dinners.  Now the pizzas, the salads, veggie dishes, and pretty much everything else is done tapas style.  This worked out perfectly for us as we were able to split 6 dishes (and drinks) for about $50 including tip.  We shared the chefs risotto (tonight it was a black pepper and cheese), the chef's boulianese with andouille sausage, a small pizza (with sausage, cheddar & grape jelly), and of course the pancetta wrapped gnocchi.  We also got some free seasoned leeks to start and shared a cheese puff pastry with a chocolate mole sauce for dessert.  All of the dishes oozed creativity and the gnocchi and risotto dishes were to die for.  Chef Eric made the right move going the tapas route as it gives his customers a great chance to sample a larger array of his creative dishes.  Some of them might be a little exotic for most, but all of them have a kaleidoscope of flavors both big and small.

So I'm happy to say I can once again recommend Centurion as a Downtown Phoenix destination.  Chef Eric is a tremendous talent who seemingly has no fear of trying new flavor combinations no one else would think of.  Some creations are better than others, but with a cheaper tapas style menu now available, his creativity is now easily accessible for the masses.
