xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g We had a romantic brunch here w/ an amazing view overlooking the Bellagio fountains. The food was a bit overpriced, but I knew going in we were paying for the ambiance and food would come second. We tried the basic brunch items such as eggs benedict and French toast. The standout item was our dessert: Frozen strawberry soufflé w/ grand marnier and pistachios. Absolutely divine!!

At the end of our meal, it was a nice added touch, when we were given an array of chocolates to choose from.
