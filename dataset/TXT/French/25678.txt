Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA love this place. perched high up on the 64th floor of the swanky 'the hotel' at mandalay bay this open,modern and fun restaurant has everything working in its favor. We got a nice corner table with a gorgeous view of the strip. We dined at Michael Mina @ Bellagio the night before for our wedding anniversary and were not quite impressed but this place more than made up for it. 

The bubbly rose moscato wine was by far one of the best glasses of wine I've had. The complimentary bread was a bit disappointing .. it was way too hard to be chewed and digested properly.. 

We ordered 2 entrees after consulting our server for recommendations
- cod brandade: This was by far one of the best seafood dishes ever to have gone down my throat. The cod was perfectly cooked and had great flavor and spices to go with it. 

- maine lobster curry with coconut basmati rice: Believe it or not this was my first lobster dish... the lobster itself was a bit chewy but the rice and the curry made the whole dish very delectable

the chocolate souffle was served in a ceramic case and was extremely delicious although I would have preferred more of the pistachio ice cream on the top

the best part was the complimentary madeleines served fresh from the oven .. perfect way to end the meal .. on our way out we had a sneak peek at the lounge but since we had to go somewhere else we did not have enough time to check it out .. definitely a must do for next visit ...
