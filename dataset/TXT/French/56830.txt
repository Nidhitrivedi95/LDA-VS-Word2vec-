rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Came here for a late lunch and had a croque madame with some bellinis. You really can't go wrong with anything at Bouchon. I've been to the location in Yountville many times, so it was nice to try a different location. Our server was so sweet and the food was very good. Can't wait to come back!
