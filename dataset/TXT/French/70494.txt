xaqW4NkmUCGRRjmLxiFJ6Q OH how I want to give this place a single star!  I want to keep this place a secret so that the lineups are short when I show up hungry!  

Why reiterate what other posters have said and I don't typically give out 5 stars willy-nilly.  Yes, the food is served fresh and you see all the backup ingredients in the fridge.  Yes, the crepes are filled to the max and delicious.  Yes, the kitchen and decor is clean.  And yes, the staff are good looking and extremely friendly.  They are a creperie and they do not disappoint!  

I ordered the New York crepe, the spicy mustard had the perfect amount of horseradish that put a tear to my eye, literally.  I would definitely head back, but for those reading my post, I advise you to stay away!
