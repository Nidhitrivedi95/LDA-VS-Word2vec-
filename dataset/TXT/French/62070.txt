SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ of course our anniversary beckoned us back to House of Tricks. the weather was perfect for our outdoor dining experience. the service was wonderful again, with nary a complaint. 
we started with a kale salad and it was tender and sweet, plenty of young kale. my entree included the halibut dish. i'm normally not a big fan of halibut, but this fish was prepared so delicately and deliciously, i couldn't stop myself from eating the entire dish, knowing i had to indulge in one of their rich deserts. 
again, this restaurant is in our upper bracket price range for our budget, but it's always worth it for great food and to be with the lovely wife.
