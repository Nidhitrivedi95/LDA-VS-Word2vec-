hvjgF-vnPw2jyL5DBuB0qg I have never given such a bad review but was so disappointed in this restaurant that i felt it necessary to do so. Service was okay. I asked the server to recommend some dishes and he wouldn't. The food was not good,  and while I'm fine paying for an expensive meal that I enjoyed, at garde manger, we paid for an expensive meal that was less than ok. It was the worst short rib that I've ever eaten. Flavors didn't work and was nothing special. Spicy jerk crab legs were small and had little meat, esp for the price. I didn't care for lobster poutine. It was the one thing that my husband enjoyed. The only dish I enjoyed was the lentil and goat cheese bruschetta. We came to Montreal and wanted to try garde manger because of a recommendation and the great reviews. It really disappointed.
