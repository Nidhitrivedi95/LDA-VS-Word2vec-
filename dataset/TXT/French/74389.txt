xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g My husband made this a Valentine's Day surprise for me.  Made 7:00 reservations and arrived at 6:40 to make sure we were punctual on what is always a busy restaurant night.  He read that this was one of the top romantic places in Vegas.  Imagine his surprise when we  arrive at a what can be best described as a madhouse.  People being herded in a line that took 20 minutes to get through.   After the crazy line, were asked to give our cell so they could text us when our table is ready. Very personal touch... Went to the bar to get a drink and wait and were TOTALLY IGNORED by three bartenders running around like chickens with their heads cut off. Romantic ambiance?  The elevator opened to, I am not kidding, the bustling, freaking kitchen!? How is that for  romantic?  As we entered the line, we passed an entirely too loud band playing what sounded like music appropriate only for a gin joint in the forties.  I kept expecting to see the lounge singer start stripping.  A romantic song was played once or twice, and I assume the loudness was to drown out the noise of the hundreds of people here.  We were acually seated at 7:30.  The most pleasant experince was the food, which was very good, but our "waiter" barely had four interactions with us.  When you pay almost 500 dollars for a meal, you expect great food served in an impeccable manner.   This place failed miserably to deliver the service aspect.  I felt SO bad for my husband,  because he kept apologizing for the choice to come here.  It's always the thought that counts and I was blown away only by his romantic gesture.  Only his wonderful company made the evening special. This place was almost a total waste of his money and for that I recommend that others not do the same.  For a better romantic and intimate experience,  I suggest Picasso ( where we went last year).  Really great food and truly top-notch service. Only the food makes this a two star review.
