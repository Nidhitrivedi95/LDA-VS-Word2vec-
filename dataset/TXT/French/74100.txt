xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g Let me tell you how to use this restaurant.  I haven't had their food but in order to take advantage of the view, just come up around 9:30pm for their famous chocolate souffle ($15) and a view of the bellagio fountain and the strip that you will never forget.  

I can't imagine a better dessert...it was so warm, fluffy, light yet hitting all your sweet spots...gosh, one of the best desserts I've ever had in my lifetime.

I personally thing this was the best $15 I spent at Vegas.  Usually, Vegas wins....this time, I finally won....=)
