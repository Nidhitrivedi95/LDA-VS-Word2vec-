hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA Baguette cafe is one of the best places to eat in Las Vegas.  I used to eat there all the time.  The service is fantastic- you feel like part of the (very extended and busy) family when you visit.  

I recently moved away from Las Vegas but I will definitely make sure Baguette Cafe is one of the places I visit when I return.
