lNB-yJoVi-sk6X0uoWOh-g When I started my appetizer I was pretty sure it would be a 5 stars. However, the main courses came way too salted even if the meat was absolutely amazing. Worst, the waiter started chatting at the bar for about an hour. We spent a total time of 2 hours and half at the restaurant waiting to be served. Last but not least, the desert was a joke, we got a donut for $10. The whole desert menu was way under my expectations for a restaurant of that kind of standing. My stars only stands for the appetizer and the meat, but the rest deserves a zero. Definitely not a recommendation unless they change their deserts and most importantly their waiter.
