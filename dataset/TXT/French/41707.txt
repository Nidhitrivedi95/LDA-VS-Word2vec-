klzCMxmhrHWZeNseS4GKFg After returning home after a 3 week vacation I can confidently say this was one of the best meals we had while we were traveling. While not the most adventurous of eaters, I ordered the steak with mushroom sauce and the hubby had the duck. Both were cooked fantastically, and served with the best veggie and potato sides. Everything tasted so simple and fresh, I wanted to come back again and again. For dessert we each had white chocolate blueberry cheesecake and despite being stuffed, we finished every last bite. This place is a MUST visit!
