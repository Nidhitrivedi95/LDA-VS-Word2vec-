3jKUbhGSjFTv5jZ0wnW0xA I went here with my husband for a special dinner out in December. We are only beginning to learn French, so we're not very good at communicating yet. Our waiter spoke very little English, but he was patient with us and explained the menu very well, especially considering the language barrier. Neither of us have had a lot of experience with French food, so we were excited to try something new. I had the duck confit and he had some sort of duck ravioli (I can't remember exactly what it was called). His ravioli was delicious, but my confit was outstanding! It was buttery and so tender that it fell right off the bone. The hubby doesn't frequently like to share food, but after he tried mine, he probably ate about a fourth of it! For dessert, we ordered creme brûlée. It was wonderfully creamy, but not too sweet and perfectly crisp on top. 

We were seated by the window, so I was a little worried it would be cold. However, they had nice heaters on the floor right by the windows, so it was cozy. Not too cold! We had a great view of the quaint little neighborhood outside, so it was fun to people-watch while we chatted and ate. The back of the restaurant had a beautiful little fireplace and (I think) a small bar. This was a lovely little spot and I can't wait to visit again!
