They serve local organic ingredients.  But the food is nothing like you can imagine.  The incredible talent and passion of the chef is evident in every dish.  You will be blown away by the food and it's very reasonably priced, too.  Everybody who works there feels like a part of the family.  I wish them all kinds of luck, they are amazing, very creative, wonderful people.  I will be going there next time I'm in Montreal.
