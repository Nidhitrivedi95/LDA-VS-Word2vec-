XcWlBj5oQgzKhR7Cxovj3w It seems when you cross through airport security the terminals become a desert of food choices, a wasteland of fast food and Starbucks.

We chose this restaurant because it was the only sit down near the terminal. The wait staff was either very good or just phoning it in. Fortunately we had the good.

It's not very often that hubby and I order the same thing. This time we did and it was good. We had (drumroll please) the pork belly sandwich. The sandwich was served hot but the fries were lukewarm. The sandwich was accompanied by a suitable serving size of a delicious spread. 

The missing star is due to the disconnect with the serving staff. Some of the staff stood in a huddle reminiscent of a kindergarten soccer team. The huddle moved from area to area. A table near us was not attended. A server learned of the situation and instead of stepping up and handling the problem he called out to another server to let another server know. That's annoying.
