FRuuIDOd21pTJHvEGIt1Gg My favourite meal during my Montreal stay!

We arrived at noon on Sunday - there were plenty of customers inside but the place is pretty large so we were seated immediately. 

We shared 1 croissant, 1 large orange juice, crepes with berries and chocolate sauce, and a tomato/goat cheese omelette with a bagel.

All of it was delicious and tasted fresh. The chocolate sauce was decadent and the goat cheese omelette was perfectly cooked. My only complaint was the "large" OJ was small for $6. Also, the omelette came with 3 small potato wedges - wish the mini fruit cup was replaced with more of the tasty potatoes instead!

Service was excellent and efficient. The food came within 10 minutes of ordering. The manager stopped by to ask how our meal was, and as as I exited, the server who had seated me (and who was clearing a table at the time), noticed and wished me goodbye.
