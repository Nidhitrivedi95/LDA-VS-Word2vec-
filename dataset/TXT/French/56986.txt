rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A One of the best meals I've ever enjoyed was at Bouchon.  Thank you  Thomas Keller.  I've actually been here twice for dinner, and both times far exceeded my expectations.  I've enjoyed their roasted leg of lamb which was extremely well prepared.  But their steak frites is out of this world!  Perfectly seared outside, and soft, tender inside.  Bursting with flavor.  And the fries are insane!  They may be the very best fries I've ever had.  The nice crunch and salty seasoning.  They give you a ton of them too, which is great.  Bouchon has a really fun bistro atmosphere.  Their bar in the front is really cool, showcasing their fresh fish.  I've heard so many good things about their breakfast, this may be something I need to experience on a future trip.  But for now, Bouchon remains a top spot on list for Vegas.
