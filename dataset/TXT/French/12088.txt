4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw My friends and I came here. It was very busy, luckily I made reservations. We were sat out on the patio. It does have a great view of the Bellagio Fountains. I had the steak frita with the brandy peppercorn sauce and it was amazing. I am not sure if the lunch menu is different from dinner but the steak is not a traditional size. It's very thin but the meal is very filling. I would like to go back and try their brunch and dinner.
