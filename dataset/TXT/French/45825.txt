mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q One of the only restaurants at the MGM Grand that I actually enjoyed (I've eaten at all the restaurants except for Nobhill Tavern).  Went over a year ago in the winter, and got the Seasonal Discovery Menu (9 course prix fixe menu)  for $148 at that time.  Now it's $155.

The presentation was excellent and the food was delicious.

My favorites were the pumpkin soup, poached baby oysters, and the langoustine carpaccio.

Service was very quick but not rushed.  Usually, restaurants with prix fixe menus have long gaps between courses but they were very efficient and attentive in not having us wait between courses.

Note:  Formal dress code not enforced.  I wore a tank top and jeans and they didn't care.

Would definitely go back since the menu changes seasonally!
