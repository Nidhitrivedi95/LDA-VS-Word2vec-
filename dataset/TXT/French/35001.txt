We came here during Magic week in Las Vegas, so there were way more people at the restaurant than expected for a Tuesday night.  The hostess in the front was acting strangely and didn't recognize us when we came back in 15 minutes to see if our table was ready.  Our server inside was actually really sweet and helpful.  There was a little wait, but she was so pleasant it made up for any waiting we had to do.

The restaurant itself is really cool.  It's my favorite Cosmo restaurant interior.  I want that flooring in my house!!  I have yet to see the outdoor seating, but I bet it's very fun to eat with that view outside.

My favorite part of the meal was the Comme Ca Burger.  It is in my top 5 burgers in Vegas (Flemmings, Vitner Grill, Tommy Bahama, Del Taco, and now Comme Ca)... and yes I said Del Taco.  If you have never tried the double del cheeseburger, you have not lived.  But anyway, moving on, I have to give it to Comme Ca for cooking it perfectly to order.  The patty is really thick, I was surprised to see the whole burger medium throughout.  Many restaurants cannot do this!  I couldn't stop eating the fries either.

I also had the roasted lamb.  I didn't enjoy it as much as the burger, and it was served with a charred eggplant sauce (never had tried this before).  It was good, but the lamb wasn't very flavorful.  The eggplant sauce wasn't kicking up the party for me either.  But then again, I am no food critic.  It might be a fantastic combo for someone else, I would actually love to hear what people have to say about this dish.

In the end, I would bring the guys here, even with a big group, and have the burger and some beers.  The restaurant is high energy, beautiful, great for groups.
