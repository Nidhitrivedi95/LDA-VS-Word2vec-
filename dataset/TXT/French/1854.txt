0JGMKaKJGVuDus5WcJzvjw Meat Lover? You have to try the Côte de Bœuf! How does 32 ounces of beef along with the rib and the BONE MARROW sound? Yeah, I was pretty much a fan too. Luckily I went with a few people so I was able to sample a few dishes including the lobster and spaghetti and scallops with pulled pork and they were all excellent. Combined with the blackboard for a menu, this really is a place not to be missed.
