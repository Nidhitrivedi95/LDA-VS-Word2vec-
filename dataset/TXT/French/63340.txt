SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA I was lucky to be taken here on someone else's dime and had a thoroughly enjoyable meal. The service is terrific and unobtrusive, with waiters constantly replacing small slices of crusty bread for every patron, and refilling dishes of olive oil and water. Having trouble choosing between many nice menu items, I finally settled on the trout, which was a generous serving cooked with an almond crust, pan fried in butter with tomatoes and garlic. There were al dente green beans on top. A very well-coordinated wait staff brought out all of the dishes for our fairly large party together. For dessert I had a lemon tart. It had a pistachio crust, very sour lemon, and a meringue on top. Though all of the elements were good, I wasn't convinced that they all came together. I like lemon desserts because they usually aren't so sweet, yet the very sweet meringue overcompensated for the sour lemon. The richness of the pastry crust, while good on its own, didn't quite combine with the other favors. However, that's just my taste, and the overall experience was still 5 stars. About the price - though the 3 dollar signs would have scared me off, the average entree price was about $20, and there were lots of appetizer and salad options. The portions were generous, and it would be possible to eat a nice meal or just drinks and dessert without totally breaking the bank. I would recommend to anyone visiting Cleveland.
