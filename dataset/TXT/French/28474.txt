EEIz44ewHhOKmfTloAK13g Ate here with my wife on June 22/16, for my birthday. Reservation was made 2 months in advance & still could only get a 9:30pm seating. This place is popular!
This was the best meal I have had since I had dinner at Atelier de Joel Robuchon in Paris a few years ago. Alo was perfect in almost every way. My only gripe was a large group eating in the bar had a newborn baby with them who cried the whole time we were having cocktails. This is not a restaurant for children!
Other than that, nothing but praise- food, wine pairings, ambience & service were above reproach. Friendly, helpful service by all the staff, especially the sommelier, who really knew his stuff & explained each wine carefully & with great passion. The room itself is absolutely beautiful.
Tasting menu of 5 courses was actually 13 courses, including amuse-bouche & 2 dessert courses. Every single course was heaven. See attached picture of our menu, including the wine pairings. The menu is presented to you in a small envelope at meal's end as a little remembrance- very nice touch!
Best restaurant in Toronto, IMHO!
