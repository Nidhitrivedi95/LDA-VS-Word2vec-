O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q We had lunch here which was fine, though for $20-40 for an entre for lunch, I would have expected better. Three of us had steaks since it is a steakhouse, and they were nothing special in cut, flavor or preparation.  Two were cooked more than requested. I had traditional steak frittes which was ok, but nothing about the frittes were anything to suspect anything but ordinary frozen food (another reviewer raved about the fries. No idea why.). Service was mediocre.  Our lunch was a little later in the day, about 1:30 but with a near empty restaurant you would expect they could pay a little attention and check water occasionally. Also due to lack of attention and time to prepare the meals, lunch was really long, though in defense we didn't complain. Convenient though, since we were staying at the hotel.
