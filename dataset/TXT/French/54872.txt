rBOpDqeQl0J_fbDtY-cWxg My wife and i ate here a few times several years ago.  Great food at very reasonable prices, but the place was starting to look a bit tired so we were in no hurry to go back.  Last week we were invited to a family function which happened to be hosted here.  We could not believe this was the same restaurant - it has been completely transformed both inside and out.  It's now elegant and cozy but they retained the charm of the century old building.

Thankfully what did not change was the quality of the food and service.  Extensive menu with something to please everyone in the group.  Probably the best french onion soups i have ever had.  Steak was beautifully seasoned.  Seafood seemed to be a big hit with those that went this option with a few raving about the steamed mussels.

Great to see the same waiters from years ago were still here, and jovial as ever.  Not only were they attentive, but they were fun and had us laughing.  They seemed to know many of the other patrons by name which suggested these were regular customers.

Non-pretentious, great food, sincere and friendly service....there is a reason this place has been around so long. Highly recommended.
