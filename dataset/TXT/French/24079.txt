Waited half an hour with our reservation. Annoying that we had to stand in the tiny hallway up against a whole lot of strangers and people trying to get in and out of the restaurant.

After that -
Duck in a Can!
Foie Gras on Poutine!
Pot o' Meat!

DAMN good. So rich. So delicious.  SO MUCH FOOD!

Presentation was an awesome experience.

I ate one dinner in Montreal and was so glad it was this one?
