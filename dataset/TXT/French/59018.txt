rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w Hands down the fanciest restaurant I've ever been to.  The quality and freshness of the food is amazing and the service can't be beat.  My favorite dish here is the sea urchin risotto (I've never had anything like it and it's probably one of my favorite dishes of all time).  Do not order it al dente/ask them to cook it a little longer if you're not a fan of pasta on the harder side.  The desserts are delicious (I tried the creme brulee) and they even give the ladies a box of 2 chocolates at the end and some sampler treats.  The bartender was awesome.  Although there was a limited specialty cocktail menu, he went to the kitchen to find fruits to make me a mango mojito which tasted amazing (I saw him taste-test it himself before serving it to me).  The rest of the staff were very knowledgeable (the head waiter told us he spoke 5 languages fluently) and the ambiance is romantic/classy.  The only reason I could not give Le Cirque 5 stars is because of the very high price ($250/couple) and wait time (we had to wait about 30 minutes to be seated although we had reservations and there were not that many tables filled... I have a feeling they waited for us to order drinks at the bar before seating us...)
