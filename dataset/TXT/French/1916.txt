0JGMKaKJGVuDus5WcJzvjw Can't say I love this restaurant. They don't print menus and only have one chalkboard. The fact you have to get up to look at the menu on the wall is taking the piss. I'll crane my neck gladly, but walk over and hover over another table of diners to gawk and attempt to memorize is just rude and uncouth. 

The food, however is very, very good. In your face, unforgiving, and absolutely delicious. Too bad the service was a bit indifferent and laced with attitude.

All in all one of those places that is far from a great restaurant, but worth a visit for the food alone...if you can remember what's on the blackboard.
