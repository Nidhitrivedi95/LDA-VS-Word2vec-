78TC3sZSYBzBsSJ0z5pyhw We had the Calamari, Tuscany soup, Lobster Bisque, chopped salad, Bouillabaisse  Veal Scaloppine and Prosuto Pizza.   All were well prepared.  The calamari was crispy and cooked to perfection.  The lobster bisque was very tasty and had plenty of chunks of lobster.  The Veal and Pizza were the highlight of the meal.  The  Bouillabaisse had sand in it and although tasty the sand made it inedible.  The waiter apologized and made it right saving the evening.   I was impressed with the professionalism he had in dealing with this dish failure.  Other than this one item the food and experience was very good.  I would go back but will not order Bouillabaisse....
