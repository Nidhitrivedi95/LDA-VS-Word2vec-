USleI8g1UVN9-9jm-b4uIg I went to The Fig Tree for a nice birthday dinner and was super impressed. First of all, the service was fantastic. My brother is allergic to dairy and eggs, which makes eating in restaurants extremely hard for him. In fact, he hates eating out. Servers usually either tell him what he can order on the menu (which is often not much) or they actually refuse to serve him certain dishes because of trace amounts (this annoys him). The Fig Tree was extremely accommodating, though, and made adjustments to the dishes we ordered so he wouldn't get sick. 

Secondly, and perhaps more importantly from my perspective, this food was incredible. I have lived in France before and enjoyed the creative twist The Fig Tree put on traditional French dishes. The seared foie gras with bacon praline and blueberry caramel sauce drizzled on top was unbelievable. My entree, the maple duck with raisin and sunflower seed risotto was equally incredible. Last but not least, the beignets were SO good. Warm, soft, and coated with a thick layer of cinnamon sugar. Will definitely be heading back here in the next month or two.
