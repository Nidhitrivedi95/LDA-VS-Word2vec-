hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA I was there again today. Had the turkey sandwich with a cup of pistou soup. The vegan soup was extremely tasty. The broth was rich, flavorful and exactly what I wanted!  It hit the spot on this gray, dreary day. Everyone was friendly and helpful, as always. I left feeling as if I'd eaten healthy but luxurious food and my body and tummy were both grateful!!
