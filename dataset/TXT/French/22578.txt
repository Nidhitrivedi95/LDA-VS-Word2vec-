BXx77WXfoAQaJnQuHquhCw This is the kind of place I could see myself being a regular at if I lived in the area. Great French pastry (the almond chocolate croissant was particularly outstanding), nice neighborhood feel to the area, and the only Patisserie so far I've been in that has decent dining space. 

One deterrent would be my one long straight frickin drive from Richmond hill along Yonge St., though I can't let that cloud my judgment. This place is easily up there with the best patisseries in GTA.
