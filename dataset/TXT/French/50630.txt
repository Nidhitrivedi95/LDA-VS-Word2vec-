OYHpqY6-3C-wXR-uPbHhwA I went for breakfast and had an omelette. This review is just about that one meal. 

This is NOT a destination breakfast place. There was no passion in the food.  It was edible but honestly, the McDonald's breakfast tastes better despite whatever artificial ingredients it may be in it. 

The omelette had no seasoning, the cheese was not melted and the eggs were dry. That may be OK for some people but I wouldn't come here expecting a good breakfast. It is adequate at best. 

The coffee was good but the second cup was cold. 

This is a very clean place and the staff seem eager to please. FYI, the toilet paper is VERY thin and has no perforations. Good luck with that.
