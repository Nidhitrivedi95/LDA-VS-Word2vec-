We came with friends and decided to try it for Sunday Brunch.  OMG - the food was amazing and the views have to be the best kept secret in Las Vegas - it is walls and walls of floor to ceiling windows that overlook the Bellagio fountains and the fountains go off every 15 minutes on Sundays.  Did I mention that the food was GREAT and service was AWESOME.
