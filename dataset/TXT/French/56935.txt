rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I am tempted to give it 5 stars, but the service was a little off.  Nothing horrible, just not as smooth as I would expect. 
Service aside - breakfast was fantastic!  I have eaten at the Yountville location several times, but this was my first opportunity to try the Vegas outpost.  The location is a beautiful place to start your day.  It has an abundance of windows and sunshine and the decor doesn't have the "Vegas" feel to it.
The menu selections all sounded intriguing, but I opted for the item called french toast (it was bread pudding with custard and apples), some pastries and a fine latte.  Everything tasted delicious and I will definitely be back.
