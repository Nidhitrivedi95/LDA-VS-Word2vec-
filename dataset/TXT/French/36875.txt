in3zjiaLpNzr9G3K35gAJQ My mother loves French food. After reading nice Yelp reviews, I decided to take her here for her birthday dinner. I am very happy to have stumbled upon this treasure! We arrived on a Saturday at 5:45pm with no wait (but completely filled up shortly thereafter). We were immediately seated. Seating is offered inside or outside on a small patio. Dress is nicely casual. You can self-park or pay for a $4 valet in the same lot. The interior is decorated quaintly with a classic French bistro decor. It feels warm and cozy inside. As soon as we were seated we were greeted with ice water and a plate of small, warm, buttery croissants (complimentary). The menu is simple but with a nice selection to meet any taste you have for a meal.  Selections of beef, lamb, fish, crepes, et. were all available. For $13 you can order a special (choice of about 5 entrees) or for $25 you can order the prix fixe which is your choice (from 3 pre-selected) starter, entrée and dessert. My mom ordered a shrimp crepe which was delicious. The sauce was decadently rich- real French food. I ordered one of their specials- a seafood skewer. My plate came with salad, roasted vegetables and the skewer. Everything was very fresh and cooked just right. My father was the only one of us who selected a prix fixe. He chose the mushroom ravioli, peppered steak, and bread pudding for dessert. We had a glass water bottle with deliciously fresh, cool water always on our table. We never ran out of warm croissants. I tried some of my dad's bread pudding and we all agreed it was the best we had ever tasted. All of the staff were exceptionally attentive, polite and helpful. Our waiter was wonderful. It was a very nice dinner and great choice for a birthday. We will certainly return.
