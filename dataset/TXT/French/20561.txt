AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw My sister and I grabbed breakfast at the cafe. We ordered lattes, a quiche [to split] and a banana crepe [to split]. The wait wasn't too long. Both food items were SO GOOD. I wish we had more time to try it out again! The lattes were definitely overpriced for the quality. Other than that - definite recommendation.
