sphMzEIqY1I2Dzv3zLZY2g It's a far cry from the old Global that we knew and loved. One good entree, but the wahoo special was overly salty, the baby eggplant too tough to cut and the mini pumpkin had hard pieces of shell that fell into the soft filling. I told the server when she cleared the plate, but clearly she never told the chef or he would have come by. DISAPPOINTING AT BEST.  Service was absolutely horrible. There were only 6 tables occupied...and servers were non existent. Waited for wine, bread, the check. It was such a let down. We were so excited for the new concept...please go back to what worked.
