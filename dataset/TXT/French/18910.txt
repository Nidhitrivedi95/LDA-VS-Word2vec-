An_U8woQkFVsMqVblkImZQ Walked by here after dinner on Harbord St and was instantly attracted to the gorgeous interior and ambiance. It's decorated with the most beautiful chandeliers which reminded me of peach trees :P Before getting seated, you can choose your desert from a glass display case. We shared a lemon tart and tiramisu which tasted pretty standard. It's a super cute place to stop by and I might go back for some afternoon tea!
