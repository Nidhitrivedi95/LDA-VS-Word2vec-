1cGyzWtfOoDiE8V0OR85yA Love this place! Use the salad dressing- it's light and perfect. I usually do the mushroom savory crepe and the banana and Nutella or chocolate sweet crepe. It's small, so hard to visit with a large group, but quick and delicious if you're by yourself or in a small (4 or less) group. It's slightly pricey for a lunch, especially if you do one sweet and one savory like I do, but for the occasional lunch it's worth it for me. Love it!
