aSC-WLyJptVpziJpR98Ykg I could hardly wait to get to Montreal so I could go back to Chez L'Epicier.  The amuse bouche was the macaron with goat cheese which others have mentioned.  Sounds awful, tastes heavenly.  Next a shrimp salad...not  big ole shrimp on the side of the glass with seafood sauce. Oh no.  Little bitty shrimp with red grapefruit sections and radish. Filet for entree and would I like wild mushrooms, in season, with that?  Oh yes, please. Perfectly cooked.  Dessert was a delightful pistachio confection with itty bitty spheres of meringue.  How do they do that?  A cup of tea and I was blissful while I waited for the check.  But wait! There's more!  The server came back, not with the check,  but with a plate of homemade marshmallows and a little burner.  Just because the chef though I might enjoy them..."you know, like the campfire when we were children?"  Yes, but we never had homemade marshmallows at any campfire I ever sat around! And now I'm ruined.  Ruined.  I can never eat commercial marshmallows again.  No one else got the marshmallow treatment, everyone was looking as I toasted them, and why I got them I don't know.  Maybe just because I was so truly, honestly happy to be there again!
