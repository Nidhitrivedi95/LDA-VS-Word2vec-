SCklYa_jhihWAcfIn-_chg I had the croque madam. While the main part of this dish was good, I really liked the side salad. So many times you know at breakfast you get lots of potatoes and grease, not this. The salad was light, plentiful and delish!
The croque madam, I thought it was good too. I'm glad they didn't mess up mine made over easy runny with another at my table that wanted not runny. Luckily it dripped very nice, over the ham and was a perfect blend in my mouth.

The service was really cool, I really like them. The guy in the ball cap kept track of everyone in line when we were waiting outside. And he sent glaring evil eyes to the table that was holding us up from eating.

The one thing I felt though I was done eating really fast. If they sent the food out faster, people would be in and out a lot faster.

Tons of people come here for the bread, it must be really good. As we wait, one in one out with  a baguette. Perhaps I shall be Parisian and go get a baguette.
