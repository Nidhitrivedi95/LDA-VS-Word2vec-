Wish I could make it here more often. Wish they had maybe a few more drink offerings, but water would be sufficient for how good their crepes taste.

My only real complaint - reason for only 4 stars - is that they advertise one time for closing, but you find out once inside that they actually stop cooking 20-30 minutes beforehand. I've gotten there near their posted closing time before - so they were still physically open - but they wouldn't cook me any food because they had already begun cleaning the equipment. This is a huge pet peeve of mine. If you're going to post a closing time, you need to stay open and serving until that time. If you're going to stop serving earlier, just post an earlier time. Problem averted.
