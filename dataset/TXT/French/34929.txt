HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw I went here with a large group for a work dinner.  We started off with some cheese and meat platters!  The cheese platter was great, the meats were ok.  

My coworker and I split a few things, we got the beet salad to start with which was great.  Then we split the Roasted Chicken and Risotto entrees.  The Risotto had oysters in which I loved!  It was amazing and I would definitely order it again.  The chicken was juicy and flavored well.  If I had to pick one dish I would go with the Risotto.  

For dessert we split the Tarte au chocola au caramel - english toffee, caramelized popcorn ice cream which was also amazing!  

I would definitely come back here again if I were in Vegas!  There's also one in LA!
