nWW6fBfBljiRFa4sG7TyxA A nice spot for lunch after a trip to the West Side Market.  The "Pig" has a decent beer menu and while the sandwich selection is limited and  can be a pit pricey for a casual meal, the Bahn Mi was delicious (as was the veggie version).  The decor is of the "brick wall loft" style but it all works and along with the bar setup and unique food offerings, the place is a great addition to the list of new, hip dining spots on the near West side.  We'll go back.
