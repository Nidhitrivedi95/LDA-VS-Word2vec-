The croissants are excellent, as is the chocolatine. The small ciabattas are wonderful with a salad at home. Considering the quality and consistency, the prices are very fair across the board. The place is often busy and the staff does a pretty good job managing a near to full house. Even though it's in a strip mall, I like the atmosphere inside. The ice-less water that they serve is a nice detail that takes us back to the cafes of Europe. 

In a town with too many bakeries that can't even turn out good bread, this place is a gem.
