qTacF-_Iucc1Nxom_Za_5Q Anthony Rose's domination of the Toronto food scene continues with Bar Begonia, a cozy and charming little joint made to resemble a French bistro.

I knew walking into the place that I had to eat the French Onion Soup au Gratin. If it's on a menu, I'm eating it.

It's an above average variation on the dish, for sure. The broth is rich and thick, and the bread and cheese are typically delicious. (I could've used more cheese, however.)

We started with an order of the Steak Tartare, Gaufrettes, and that too was very tasty. The tartare, when mixed with the accompanying egg yolk, was rich and flavorful, while the "gaufrettes" (basically just waffle chips) made for an ideal vehicle.

I closed out the meal with an order of their Creme Brulee and I will easily admit this was my favorite dish of the night. The burnt crust was probably one of the thickest I've ever encountered but it was delicious. The custard inside was irresistibly creamy, addictively so.

The ambiance is pretty nice, too, so I'd say Rose has another winner on his hands.
