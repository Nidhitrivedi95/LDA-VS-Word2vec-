YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g Happy Birthday to ME!  5 of us went there on Friday night... GREAT service and GREAT food.  Started off with some drinks while they got our table together.  After we sat down, we ordered a cheese plate, a dried and cured meat platter, and Italian meatballs to start.  Ordered a second cheese plate ...YUM!  

After that, we were feeling very good and went all out... 
Lobster Mac and Cheese
Pork Schnitzel
Angus sliders x2
Tuna Tacos x2
Crab and Avocado Sphere
Hummus and Baba Ganoush
Wild Mushroom Ragout
Artichoke Barigoule

Those Tuna Tacos...wow...I am still craving them!  

OK....getting REALLY full (but there is always room for dessert)!

Creme brulee trio
Cheesecake lollipops
Tiramisu

...put a fork in me...I'm DONE!

I will (without question) be going back next time I'm in Vegas!
