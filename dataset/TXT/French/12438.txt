Most people there are just waiting for their table to get setup, so you'll have a seat in no time. The bartender last night was a delight; quick wit and good drink recommendations. I went with the bone-in ribeye, which was perfectly cooked, and the garlic spinach, instead of the frites (fancy fries). Both the steak and side were delicious. Make sure you try the merlot butter sauce for your steak, it's out of this world. You can also sit outside and get some good people watching in, or witness one of the Bellagio fountain shows.
