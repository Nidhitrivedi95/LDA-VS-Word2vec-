4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw It is always hard to find a good steak house or nice restaurant in Vegas that isn't crazy expensive. My friends recommended this place for my 30th. I am so happy I went. It's beautiful inside and a great place if you are looking for a delicious meal and a romantic French vibe. Everyone in the party had a different kind of steak and every single dish was amazing. Can't wait to go back.
