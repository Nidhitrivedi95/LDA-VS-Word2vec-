eJ9L40jm5VOXCIq7xs9kQw I went with my fiance for a short getaway from it all.. and so we escaped here.  This was probably the BEST recommendation we had in all of Montreal.  We went here for lunch.. it was a nicer restaurant than we expected... and it was delicious.  We went for the prix fixe lunch.. delicious!  Lots of choices and all very good.  I really liked my duck confit (with the duck leg) and my fiance enjoyed his pork tenderloin.  Very tender!  Delicious wine list as well.. very nice.. not snobby.. I would go again.
