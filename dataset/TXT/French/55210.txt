rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Thomas Keller's Bouchon is a welcome change from the mediocre food and excessively large portions that define a lot of Las Vegas brunch spots. Delicious food and just the right amount.

The ambiance is good, kind of like a chic casual French bistro. They do have some nice outdoor patio seating, which we missed because we were just a couple minutes late in getting to the restaurant.

Our server was friendly though not overly into small talk, which we really did not mind. The menu has a lot of your standard brunch options, but they also have a large selection of champagne based brunch cocktails. We tried three different ones (don't remember the exact names) and they were all delicious.

For the food, they give you this amazing warm baguette to start with marmalade and butter. It was wonderfully soft in the center and delightfully crusty outside. One of the nicest ways to spend time waiting for your meal. For brunch, we ordered the Chicken and Waffles, the French toast and the Eggs Benedict. Unfortunately once our order was placed the waiter told us that they had run out of the chicken and waffle batter and we would need to wait for about half an hour for them to prepare more. We compromised and went for the omelette instead, which was a shame since we really wanted to try their signature dish.

The food did not disappoint once it arrived. The french toast was nice and fluffy, and just the right amount of sweet. The Eggs Benedict came with one of the thickest cuts of Canadian bacon I've had anywhere, and the Hollandaise sauce on it was good. The omelette we ordered was flavorful and packed with veggies. We also got a side of bacon which was thick cut and tasty. 

Overall 3.5 stars, rounding it up to 4.
