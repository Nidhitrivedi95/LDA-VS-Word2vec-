P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ If you are in Vegas live it up a little more. Enjoyed a lovely 2.5 hour dinner after the superb Elton John show in the Coliseum. 
Guy doesn't disappoint and the dinner continued our fabulous evening. 
Tenderloin paired with excellent wine and superb atmosphere. Cheese plate and artichoke/truffle soup. Enjoy your night!
