aW6Z4NSqEVli-xYMV3jRyg The first time I visited Zebra just over a year ago, I wasn't sure I would return. The waiter was just ok; he didn't know where the sea food was sourced,wasn't sure what ingredients were in what components. Then the food other than the truffle soup was just ok. 

That changed on Friday when I gave Zebra another shot. I went with my boyfriend and we had a wonderful experience. There were little things here and there that keep me from the 5 stars: I wanted the lobster but they were out and it wasn't until I ordered it that I was informed of this, I would have liked a little more pickled cabbage with my pork bell appetizer, the lights randomly flickered on and off for the first 30 mintues i was there etc. But at the end of the night, i had a great experience, left full of really good food, and had a great time with my boyfriend. 

The wine list is extensive for Charlotte. And the suggestions from my waiter were good. I LOVED the pork belly appetizer and also the mushroom truffle soup. I had the lamb entree which was delicous (and I would like to mention that I am VERY picky with lamb so I was hesitant to order it). I was happily surprised to find some goat cheese under the lamb, but I would have been happier if there had been a little more. My boyfriend had the sole which was also good. Again, a little more of the cranberry so that there was enough for a little to accompany each bite would have been nice, but without it, it was still very good. 

We didn't have dessert so I can't comment on that, but overall i had a great time and will make sure to return.
