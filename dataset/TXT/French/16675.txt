8ciT6qjI18x9EPtOb-gqYQ Always enjoyable, great ambience... and the folks are kind, even when I brought el cheapo wines when I first started eating here...

We come a few times a year for the past 4 years... if the menu rotated more often w/ variety (not just changing from fish dish A to fish dish B), we'd certainly increase the visits.

Especially love the interesting cheeses plate (more or less the same combo as far as I can tell these past few yrs) and the pate!
