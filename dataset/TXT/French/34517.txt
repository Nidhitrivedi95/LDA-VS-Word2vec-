HojKatUfX4UHWaPqtl63NQ This was pretty well a great experience all around. The service was absolutely amazing, with enough visits that nobody ever had empty water or beverage, but not so insistent it became a hassle. The menu has a nice mix of traditional classics but also some interesting and more modern dishes as well. It was basically segmented in a small plates section and an entrees section. 

We came here for a business meal with clients and ordered a bunch of small plates including the buffalo mozzarella and tomato basil salad, gnocchi and mushroom risotto. Each one was absolutely fantastic. Most of our table ordered the Bison Tenderloin, which was heavily peppered (as advertised) and cooled to perfection. Bison can at times be a bit dry due to the low fat content but this was not the case at all here. Finally we ordered several desserts to share at the table, and each was excellent, though nothing over the top spectacular.

Finally, being situated on top of the Delano tower in the Mandalay Bay resort, the view is absolutely spectacular, and could make up for any shortcomings, which are very few. In fact, if I were pressed to come up with a negative, it would only be that the ambient noise level can be rather loud.
