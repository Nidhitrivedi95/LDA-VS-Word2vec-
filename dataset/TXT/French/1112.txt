_eNeiqWPt1MPLFF6DEIJeA As a Lakewoodian, I try to give all new restaurants a try and hope they survive amidst the well-established, beloved places in the city. So, when my pregnant wife said, "I really want ramen tonight" I replied, "There's this new place called Roxu that has ramen on the menu." 

Let's start with what was good:

- the server (don't remember her name) was very nice, explained things well and was very accommodating

- the ramen was quite tasty; while my wife found it to be a bit too peppery, I really loved the rich broth and shinto pepper flavor

The so-so:

- the steamed buns (we got the pork and wagyu beef) were ok. The pork was better because it had a nice sauce on it; the wagyu was a bit plain. Both had what we think were chunks of beets - which were a surprise and not really complementary to the buns. The buns come with a side of simple slaw, which had a nice dressing, but all the lettuce seemed to be rib cuts (e.g. the crunchy center of the lettuce instead of the leaf). 

- the pierogies had a really thick, dense dough and dry minced chicken filling. It was an ok dish, but not one I'd get again.

The not-so-good:

- the sushi. It was sushi night, so I got the Roxu sushi roll. I'm no sushi expert, but I've had my fair share and my own personal rule is that the fish needs to be super fresh to make it worth the while. When our entrees arrived, we could smell the fish before it even got to the table - not a good sign. I was tempted to have it taken back, but was hungry and didn't want to wait for something else. The taste was quite bland and I couldn't get over the sour smell of the fish. I'm not inclined to order any sushi again.

As said above, I want this place to succeed as I think Lakewood needs the diversity that Roxu represents. I'll be back for another bowl of ramen sometime.
