XcWlBj5oQgzKhR7Cxovj3w There aren't many airports where you can find a nice salad (mixed greens - not iceberg or romaine) AND a decent glass of wine. I mean they have Sancerre for heavens sake. I'm healthy but a girl likes a nice glass of wine sometimes too. I thought this place was an airport winner.
