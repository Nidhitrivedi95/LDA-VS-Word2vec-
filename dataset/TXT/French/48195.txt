O66Zy8Y13VBm72ZDhS4fIg Great local place, attentive staff, but a bit pricey I will say. 

My wife had the BLT, while I had the burger, and both were very good.   She had the white sangria and I had the seasonal brew (stout) and both were good.   Despite the prices, well worthy of returning in the future.
