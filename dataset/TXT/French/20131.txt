aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw Overrated...macarons were stale. We got a whole box of 6 and all of them were stale...for the price we paid, that is simply not ok. Flavor was just ok on all the ones we tried (pistachio, chocolate, vanilla, coffee)

Macaron Cafe in NYC is wayyy better in terms of flavor and freshness...maybe this  place is good if you're a tourist from nowheresville and have never had good macarons. Otherwise, not sure where all the rave reviews are coming from.
