P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ This type of restaurant is hard for me to review like a regular restaurant so I am going to review Robouchon, Guy Savoy and  e' by jose andres as special places to go for the experience not necessarily the food. My palate is just not that sophisticated for these places to be a place where I have some food where I just want to pick up the plate and lick it clean. The presentation of the food is gorgeous and the bread carts and candy carts are amazing by themselves.
This review is from April 2013. I came here with my daughter and son in law. 
I did not like the décor of this restaurant, I felt like I was in a warehouse.
We did the Innovation Menu and it was beautifully presented but as I stated above I think my palate is not good enough for these places because while I like most of the food I didn't love anything enough to rave about it and want to come back. I had this experience and wouldn't come back unless I were craving bread or cheese because those were both amazing.
 I didn't get a copy of the menu we were served but I do remember there was a pea puree that others had raved about and my daughter and son in law loved but I hate peas and I was hoping this dish would change my mind but it didn't! The servers were right on top of everything though and when they noticed I only had few bites they asked why and when I explained my dislike of peas they immediately brought me another dish which was very nice.
The service here was awesome. Everyone here was so nice.
