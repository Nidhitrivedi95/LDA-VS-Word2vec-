4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I made a reservation for 5 (two of my friends heard me) When we for there they had us down for 4. They WOULD NOT accommodate us by adding another chair to our table, even if it was their mistake.  The hostess was unapologetic and said we would have to wait 45 minutes for a table for 5. We took the table for 4 as we were going to see a show later.  My husband went to pick up the tickets and when he returned our waiter was very nice and prepared a place for him. We were able to secure an extra  chair from an adjacent table.  The front staff was rude and I could not believe the poor customer service! If the food was excellent I might have forgiven the rude greeting, but unfortunately the food was mediocre.  Only saving grace  was our waiter.
