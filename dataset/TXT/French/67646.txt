UxWH8zRYIBgs6Q2oykvRdw I made RSVP with a special request and it was not as followed, it was a pretty simple request. We had a party of 14 which was split into three tables but scattered across the restaurant which was unpleasant. Our server (Victoria) was understanding about our situation and was patient. Management couldn't get one simple task right by placing us by each other. The layout of it would have worked. They tried to charge us $3 per slice of cake, which we had brought in ourselves. Which ruined the birthday event for the person who we were celebrating for. The food was not great, appetizer was bland, the main was good and then the dessert fell flat. The price of the food was not worth the quality they had presented. Will not be coming back. Do not recommend. You'll be disappointed, I was, right off the back by their service.
