XZ7eQLjyGXf6y69UT4SGhg My initial reaction when I saw them bring out the crepes was HOLY CREPE! The crepes here are freakin humongous! 

I tried both the sweet and savory ones. My wife got the traditional galette with egg, ham, and cheese. The presentation was unbelievable! It almost looked like a starfish from the ventral point of view (sorry for that biology remark). It has a really strong taste to it. I don't know if it's the ham or the cheese or a combination of both, but even my wife said it reminded her of cat food (not that she's ever tasted cat food lol but in reference to its smell). I got the nutella crepe with strawberries. It was, hands down, the best crepe I've ever had. I liked how it wasn't too soft/soggy, and it had a nice touch of crispy to it. And drizzled with nutella, how can you go wrong? 

We also tried their blueberry muffin and chocolate chip cookie. The muffin was shaped like a mushroom with a ridiculously large head, but I liked how crisp it was. The cookie was also really tasty. I enjoyed the generous amount of dark chocolate chunks and just how soft it was. 

I've never really been a huge fan of crepes but thank you to my wife for bringing me here and introducing me to this place. Will definitely be back!
