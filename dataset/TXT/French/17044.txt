9ET_RUNztevq4_OLAX80Gg A solid 3.9

Place, staff, food... as mentioned in most reviews are all OK / good. This being said, nothing was really to wooaaah about (and for the price, you would expect some woaah somewhere).

Appetizers, entrees, desserts combine several tasty ingredients, but there is always one or two things wrong here or there... too salty here, not enough of this there, steak a little bit too chewy there, not warm enough...

I would be happy to go again, but not in rush to do so... and with so many other options around, this may be a long time from now...
