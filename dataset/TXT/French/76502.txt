Yp9w4nhUowBU_IS_StFXbQ Looking for a serene location to have breakfast, my friend and I decided to dine at Tableau. While the food was decent, the service was not up-to-par to that of other restaurants at Wynn. 

With the exception of several carb-heavy dishes, the food at Tableau was overpriced for its quality. Although I liked the fact that my butternut squash soup was not too sweet, I was not a fan of the stale almonds in it. The Greek yogurt was light and went well with the berries. While the orange zest juice was refreshing, its portion was small compared to its competitors like MOzen. At the same time, my friend greatly enjoyed the Duck Croque Madame - the duck meat was very tender and juicy, while the croissant was warm and flaky. 

In terms of service, the waitress was unfriendly and only stopped by our table once after she took the order. She also forgot about one of our dishes until I reminded her in the end of the meal. 

Since the restaurant is always packed, I definitely recommend Yelpers to make reservations in advance. My friends and I plan to give Tableau another try and order its famous pancakes in our next visit.
