xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g the boyfriend brought me here for our one month anniversary...LOL yea he's a regular Casanova....(fyi i'm writing my review two years later..and i'm still with the same boyfriend if you're wondering...) 

first off...it's a gorgeous restaurant...from what i remember we took and elevator up and waited 5 mins or so to be seated (we had reservations) my boyfriend had asked for a table by the window...so we sat looking out onto the strip and had the water as our show (from bellagio hotel) WARNING the tables facing the windows are small it's like half a table....when we arrive they had a bouquet of flowers on the table waiting for us (per the boyfriend request) 

since it's been  a while i cant name our dishes...but i remember it being al carte (however u spell it) so on top the main meat dish ($35-50) you would order a side ($10-15) if i remember correctly i had the lamb while the boyfriend had the fillet Mignon....they were BOTH PERFECT the meal was perfect though it was expensive it was definitely well worth it! (i've been to other expensive restaurants and the food was mediocre (definitely not cool)

Service: was great...had a fairly young waiter but definitely attentive...he even conversated with the boyfriend for a bit and took as many pictures of us as we  liked =)

break down of the money

for half a dozen of roses in a vase (ran about $70)

food + drinks ($100)

total was around $200 ...it was once in a while kind of thing but to this day the boyfriend and i remember this date very well...it was a great experience definitely worth it
