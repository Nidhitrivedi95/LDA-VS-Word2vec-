SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA L'albatros is clearly one of the top restaurants in the city.  Amazing food that never disappoints.  They have a great happy hour if you can get into the bar area, and don't leave without trying the mushroom french toast appetizer and the cheese cart.  And al fresco dining doesn't get much better than this!
