COgwFthJpS4We16W5Gf4lw Took my girlfriend here for her birthday. We were quickly seated and treated like royalty. The ambience is very romantic. Soft lighting, low ceilings, french decor. The food came out relatively fast and was absolutely exceptional. We found a bottle of my favorite wine on the wine list and ordered that (Rombauer). There is not a place in town I would recommend over this place for a dinner date. Be ready to reach in to your pockets a little but totally worth it.
