hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA I stopped in here after getting into Vegas from California. I was famished and just wanted s simple veggie sandwich. BIG MISTAKE. 
There was nobody in line. Multiple tables needed to be cleaned off..I was noticing when it took the girl over 10 minutes to put in my order but then had to go get the owners help to ring it in correctly..which is fine) but it was an episode long. They didn't ask whether it was for here or to go. I was planning on eating it there. So I go find a table to relax and sit down and hopefully eat a good sandwich. Then I hear someone yelling, "Do you want it for here or to go?" Huhhhhh???? Walk over to me and ask..how about that! Anyway..sandwich came and if you enjoy oxidized avocado you would have enjoyed the sandwich. Soup was shit. Anyway...I'm truly not one to say anything but I'm a Chef and the whole experience was a shit show and the food was not worth any kind of trip there.
