yU3p0tEBtGuZLTcsBHw9uQ I went there recently with friends for brunch and experienced the worst service after being there several times in the past. It took them over an hour to bring me my gauffre maison which I ordered even though it wasn't that busy. After I complained to the manager, they offered & I accepted the free meal. I obviously didn't leave a tip. I'm never going back again.
