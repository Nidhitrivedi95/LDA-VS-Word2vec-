AHosGBveeXx9YjsQvdJgeg Went for Valentine's Day and it was amazing. I was seated next to the window and the view was amazing. The restaurant is clean and beautifully decorated. The service was great, very attentive and helpful. The food was delicious and the quality was top notch. I had the lobster tail and filet mignon and it was full of flavor. I also recommend the lobster bisque it's so good. I would definitely recommend for a special occasion.
