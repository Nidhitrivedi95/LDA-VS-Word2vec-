fFInb4Dl2Ix4iE-VOltbkQ I went here for a business dinner and couldn't have been more pleased. Fantastic service and a very attentive waiter who knew when to give us time to continue our meeting or check in with us. I can't say enough about the stellar French cuisine. Everything was in small portions and light, but rich and seductive favors. Verses was a wonderful treat in Montreal that I would visit again for a lovely French dinner. Merci Verses!
