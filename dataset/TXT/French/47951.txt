O3OH5IEFMPtz7mPKakPZ3Q I ate here on Valentines day with my husband. Luckily we are able to make a reservation on Yelp and was seated immediately. Very friendly staff and AMAZING food. The items on the menu are a bit pricey, I spent over $70 and my husband was still hungry. 

The item you should definiately get are the salmon tacos! It was so good I had to order it 3 times.
