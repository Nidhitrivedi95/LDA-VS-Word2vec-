P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ Maybe I don't like French food as much as I thought.  Nonetheless, I was disappointed with Guy Savoy when I ate there this week.  Also known as the "Home of the $68 Bowl of Soup", Guy Savoy has excellent service and a very subtle, albeit somewhat Devli's Advocate-esque decor (remember Pacino's office?) 

Amuse bouche (a thimble of onion soup with diced root vegetables and scallop ceviche)  was not impressive.  Next up with the asparagus risotto -- it had an asparagus foam that tasted like nothing. I've had much better risotto (if you're ever in Cabo, get the truffle risotto at  the Esperanza, holy crap.)  My dining partner ordered the hamachi carpaccio which was sent back because it was too fishy.  Guy Savoy replaced it (gratis) with a very delicious foi gras.  After that was a complimentary tasting of the $68 soup -- a nice truffle soup with some kind of foam.  My second foam of the meal. Next up was the veal chop with more root vegetables and truffle mashed potatoes.  The potatoes might have been the best mashed potatoes I've ever tasted. The veal was tough, tasteless and boring.  Ho hum, very disappointing.   Dessert was quite good... I got the item creatively-entitled "Chocolat" -- it was a series of different types of chocolate with chocolate ice cream and, guess what, a chocolate foam!  More frickin foam.  But the best foam of all the foams of the night.  Complimentary sauterne was a nice touch and after dessert, they rolled over a cart full of macaroons and various chocolates which was another nice treat.  I tried the peanut butter and jelly macaroon (not worth it) and a small piece of white chocolate with raspberry (ok).  All in all, a very nice meal but I've had far better at Jean Georges, Aureole and elsewhere.  Three stars are in comparison to those places... 5 stars compared to most places.

$400 for the two of us before tip.
