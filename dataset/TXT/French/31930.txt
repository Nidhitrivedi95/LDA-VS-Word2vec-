gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA It's been a couple years since we ate here, but I'm making my list of Michelin-starred restaurants and forgot that I never Yelped Alize. This was my first real "fine dining" experience, and I wasn't terribly impressed. Now that I've been to other greats like Cyrus and French Laundry, I'm even less impressed. The food was heavy and overly sauced, and the service was pretty damn snooty. Great view, but nonetheless, give Alize a miss - like most things in Vegas, it's overpriced, overhyped, and underwhelming.
