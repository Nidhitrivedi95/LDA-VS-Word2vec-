ME6D5nLlfG0xZCtICOYDuw Had lunch here and used my restaurant.com coupon:-) I had the potato soup with bacon and leeks...yum! The starter bread that they server is very good as well. I had the Beef Bourguignon over homemade pasta, which was good, but too salty for me, so I enjoyed my pear cocktail instead:-) I think I beat the lunch crowd, service was pretty fast as the restaurant was basically empty.
