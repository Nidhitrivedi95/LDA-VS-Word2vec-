-4TMQnQJW1yd6NqGRDvAeA Went here to celebrate our anniversary.  Generally these occasions are congratulated upon arrival when you request in your reservation.

The service was extremely slow (aka 1 hour per course). It was so bad we opted to skip dessert.

The food: this is what you are coming for, right? Well skip the house brasserie if you want good food.  The food was inventive concept with an interesting perspective but did not deliver in overall flavor. It will leave you flat, and not worth the wait.
