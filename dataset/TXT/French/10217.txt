4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Well what can I say, this place is delicious for brunch. Out door seating is a must!!! You get a perfect view of the Bellagio fountains. I ate here for brunch for mothers day, it was my first time and I had a nice time. A bit pricy but well worth it, I will defiantly go again.
