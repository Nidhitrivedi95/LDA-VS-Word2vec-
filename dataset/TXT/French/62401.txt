SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ My new favorite place!  My Honey and I went on a Thursday evening. The online reservations through the Yelp app was Great!  What a beautiful little spot. The great ambiance was a pleasant surprise....Super romantic! Every step was impressive.  Cocktails were tasty. The Pork Belly appetizer was delicate and flavorful. I had the Pork Chops and He had the Tenderloin.  Both were cooked to perfection. The Bread Pudding was sweet treat to top off a Nice dinner. We will definitely be back for more!
