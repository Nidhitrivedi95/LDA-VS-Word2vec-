cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg HOLY COW!!... i mean pig!  If you love any part of a pig including the head, make sure you make early reservation to this place.  The foie gras poutine was so decadent but so good!! Pickled tongue...sounds strange but don't knock it til you try it.  Worthy entrees include duck in a can, the pork shoulder and the stuffed pig's foot! No vegetables served at this establishment...
