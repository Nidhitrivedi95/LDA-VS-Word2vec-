kKC7UTcHZM3zLfT97x3msg I had dinner here twice. The first time it was quite good, though I can't recall what I ate. The second visit however, was pretty terrible. I had the tuna tartare and the lobster special. Both were under-seasoned and utterly bland. Lobster was under cooked in a tasteless (saffron?) creamy bisque.  Could barely eat it. Service was fine, if not slightly overbearing. HUGE disappointment.
