O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q The service was good, but I have to say I was totally disappointed.  I had been wanting to go there for quite some time and was excited when we finally decided to go for dinner.  The food was just okay and some of it, the leafy salads, just didn't seem all that fresh.  Just a bummer all around.
