rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw Our party of 9 had dinner here for my cousin's bachelorette party. Overall the atmosphere was welcoming but it was really dark in the dining so that it was difficult to see our dishes.

Our table shared a variety of appetizers:

- Foie Gras Parfait
- Charcuterie Board (housemade pate, pork rillette, ham)
- Bardot Escargot -hazelnuts, chartreuse butter 

I expected a lot from the escargots because our server touted them to high heaven. But they were just ok. Charcuterie Board was solid--loved the rillette. But I was ALL ABOUT THE FOIE GRAS PARFAIT! So wonderfully smooth and somehow rich and light at the same time. The port gelee added the perfect acidity to it.

For entrees, seester and I split:

-Oak Smoked Duroc Pork Chop with Crispy Lardons
-Alaskan Cod with a Saffron Beurre Blanc

The pork was very juicy and the lardons were decadent. The horseradish was fantastic with it. The cod was light, flaky and I loved the corn. 

But beware....if you love wine--bring your $$$$$$  The cheapest bottle was around $150 and I kid you not, we saw a bottle that was listed for $38K---no joke!

Overall, I really enjoyed the dinner but it was VERY pricey especially if you order booze.
