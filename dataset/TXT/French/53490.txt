QlSpPzc4Oy05ic-PsoYH4g Wow! Came in on a Wednesday night and it was sooo good. Great service from a very friendly staff and the food and drink was A+. The aracini is great and the tapioca with chorizo is a must get. Of course the duck fat fries are good (and good for you!)  All around good place and can't wait to recommend and go back!
