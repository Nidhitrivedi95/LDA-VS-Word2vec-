BSmqxPbQglQwP2R56OqOag Very nice, local restaurant, with tasty food. I find the waitstaff to be so nice and friendly every time. Sometimes the service is a little slow, but not typically. Now that the space has been remodeled, it is much nicer and can accommodate more people. However, this is not a place that I would take someone to have a great meal, but it is local and it is good.
