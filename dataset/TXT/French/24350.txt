cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg Only one word can really describe this restaurant. AMAZING. Everything is top notch,The service is attentive and friendly, There's an open kitchen which is like watching live theatre. The Food mostly meat and pork with many Fois Gras specials depending on the season. It is a little hectic and loud but fun.
