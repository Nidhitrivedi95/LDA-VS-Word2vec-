zqNgwQjj0_XAll-neGikIw An unexpected delight! One wouldn't think that there could be a nice little French restaurant in a strip mall. The brunch was delicious. We had eggs benedict and a quiche both of which were served with mixed greens. It's byob so if you want a mimosa bring your own bubbles. The coffee was quite nice as well. I would definitely return to try more dishes!
