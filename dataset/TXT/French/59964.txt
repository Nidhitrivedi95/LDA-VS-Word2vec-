Expect the unexpected and have fun! The 21 course tasting menu will give you everything spanish with a twist. Start with a cocktail /spanish wine as you take in the ambience that's Jaleo, with background shouts of 'Paella!' Then take your seats in José's private room with his card catalog of chotskes. 

They're very accommodating to food allergies. But if you're vegan, kosher, dairy free, you're out of luck. (Besides, you're in Vegas. Kick the diet to the curb for a few days and burn off calories at the craps table). Everyone else prepare to taste anything from a peanut butter wonder bread, to hairy crab, beef, scallops, uni, edible sangria and more. The menu changes to their whim. We had a few dishes that were different from our visit 1yr ago, and a few favorites (hello ) that's kept on the menu. They even catered to my childish request for 'fluffy' cotton candy when they were making empanadas. 
Come with an empty tummy, open mind, and mouth. Enjoy the show!
