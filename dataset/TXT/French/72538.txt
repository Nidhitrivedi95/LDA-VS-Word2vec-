XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q Let me start off saying that 2 years ago my husband and I had a spectacular dinner at L'Atelier by Joel Robuchon and finally got the "Time" to visit Joel Robuchon.

We got a limo service and a nice tour inside the mansion of Robuchon which was very memorable and the hostess escorted us to the dining area. 

Decore: In comparison to L'Atelier this place was much more chic and elegant. However, I still loved the idea to see all the chefs preparing and decorating my plates at L'Atelier.  In other words, great ambiance.

Food: This time we decided to go with the $275 Menu per person since 16 course is always a bit too much and good thing we did so. Amuse Bouche was beet gazpacho soup and it was remarkable. Since we were with 4 people we decided on getting different dishes to taste most of them. We got 2 appetizers, 2 entrees per person and a dessert. The entrees that I picked were Chilean Seabass and Beef Cheeks. Let me tell you Im not really sure if I loved the seabass but the beef cheeks were the best I've ever had, it melted in my mouth and I took the taste with me. The dessert was Sugar Sphere that included sorbet inside which was also super delicious and refreshing. Plating of all the dishes was out of this world detailed and beautiful. 

We got a bottle of 100 yrs special Martel Cognac and it perfectly complemented our choices of food including the Black Cavier and Foie gras dishes. 

The service was impeccable, we had the cheese tasting and bread cart would constantly offer to refresh our bread basket... 

In other words, yes you do want to experience Joel Robuchon's 3 Michelin star restaurant and yes you will get your money's worth through experience, elegance, luxury and of course a taste of art.
