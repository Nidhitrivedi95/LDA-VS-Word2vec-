H464UiJ5c7q5dAJ14h731A I have been to this restaurant twice and like it a lot. The menu is not that long, but the focus is on seasonal ingredients (they do vegetables very well) and (for main courses) meat. There is a good wine list, with a lot of private imports. As for wine by the glass, on both occasions I was offered one that wasn't listed on the backboard. I'll be back for sure.
