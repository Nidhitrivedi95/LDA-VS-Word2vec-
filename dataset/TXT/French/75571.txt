Ycp3Agr7dt71TZkeKV7jng So it took friends from Vancouver to introduce this place to us.  I lived in this building for five years and never once stepped foot into Le Gourmand.  1. I don't drink coffee.  2. I'm not into sweets.

The cookies are yummy.  Moist, flavourful, chock-full of goodness.  If they're still warm, bonus.  

4 stars not five because sometimes the cookies are misshapen and/or partially burnt.  The consistency in size is also a factor.  

Damn good cookies though.
