4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw My boyfriend and I went here for lunch, we both got the pulled pork sandwich, it was good but different from your typical pulled pork. Service was great, food quality was great,
Prices were very reasonable being Vegas (our sandwiches were like $14 each), we got in and out pretty quick and it was big enough that I wrapped half.
