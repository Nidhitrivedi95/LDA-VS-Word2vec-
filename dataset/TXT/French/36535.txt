i5vxtyiHKYnRcJ0p9N7mLw Let me start with everything on the menu sounds good, but I went with soup of the day cream of mushroom and it was delicious.  It came with a 1/2 sandwich so I choose the #9 on a crusty baguette.  The sliced meats were so good, included asiago cheese, sopressata & capacollo.  It was fantastic.  My mom had some of the homemade bread which was very good.  They also catered to my sisters celiac with some tasty GF pasta with meat sauce.  I look forward to going back and trying new items and some of the desserts esp tiramisu.  The employees were helpful and very friendly.  Loved it!
