oJZNHz5UUVUgrZwVBVlpYw I had booked High Tea for 3 people and on the day we also brought our grandmother along-she was in a wheel chair. I had forgotten to call and tell them we had 4 people (my error). When we turn up the hostess told us that 4 people cannot be accommodated, so our part decided that we would split up and only 2 of us would do high tea. The hostess said that she cannot accommodate 2 people either!  We were very polite and the hostess was very curt and rude with us. We decided to leave. As we were leaving I called the Petrossian on my cell phone (pretending to be someone else) and asked if they had room for 4 people for High Tea. They said absolutely, come on over!
