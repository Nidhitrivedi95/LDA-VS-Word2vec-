I went on a trip to Montreal for the first time with my boyfriend and I made reservations for us at this restaurant after seeing all the great reviews on this website, but boy was I BEYOND DISAPPOINTED

The service? Considering the fact we made reservations they seated us on time.. in a cramped little corner with barely enough space to move around. I could practically hear the breathing of the person in the next table beside me.. After we were seated we had to wait over 45 minutes (no exaggeration) for our orders to be taken... after that we sat there for another 1/1.5 hours in the cramped area to get our food !!!

The food? This is why we went in the first place, the boyfriend and I LOVE trying new foods and are always open to new things but the food here? DISGUSTING !!!! We ordered bison ribs and duck magret in mushroom sauce... don't get me wrong, the mushroom sauce was divine but the duck itself was not cooked properly when I specifically asked for it to be done well and it made me sick.. the bison ribs the bf got were too sweet and on top of that had a STENCH that lasted in my nose til the next day... The staff didn't even come by to ask how the food was.. if they had I might have asked them to eat this and ask them if they considered this edible food. One thing that was good there was the fries that came with the meal... the bf and I ended up eating just that and leaving the rest... 

All in all, a horrible first dinner experience in Montreal because of this place. I would NEVER EVER recommend this place to anyone in their right mind.. horrible service and horrible food. The reason people probably said it was too much too eat was because it was so disgusting that you just couldn't manage to eat it without throwing up (which we did by the way, after we got back to our hotel)... If after this you still wish to go, then by all means go for it.. but don't say you weren't warned !
