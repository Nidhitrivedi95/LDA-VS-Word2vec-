y0cgy0tTh_C8NWCk0WGgjQ I didn't dine in but my friends did. Decent prices and good cocktails. Went during Salsa on St Clair, busy but we got seated thanks to a friend. Reminds me of bigger chains but with a few unique offerings. The sliders look  good but it's a small portion. Free table bread with red bean dip was provided.
