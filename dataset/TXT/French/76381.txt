Yp9w4nhUowBU_IS_StFXbQ What a lovely brunch I had at Tableau. I chose to sit outside but there isn't a bad seat in their beautiful conservatory! 

I had their vegan pancakes, Gardein sausages and a mimosa. It was delicious! the pancakes were light and fluffy despite it having no dairy and it was served with soy whipped cream! 

I definitely recommend this as a must visit for brunch located in the stunning Wynn Hotel.

Cheers!
