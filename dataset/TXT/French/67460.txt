UWupVhvb1qWZh8rNowJliQ First and foremost the service is simply FIRST RATE.  I haven't had such good service in such a long time I almost forgot what it was like.  The food was excellent and the prices were reasonable.  I am not sure what else you would ask for.  Great spot for quiet financial district lunch.
