rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Just landed in Vegas & staying at the Venetian w/ daughter for her B-day & always make my first stop breakfast at Bouchon which has always been excellent but even the fabulous beignets did not offset the horrible service this morning. Never have I not tipped a waiter but Matt couldn't work at an IHOP. His $15.00 tip went to the bus person who gave us more service than him  & waiter at the bar who gave us coffee while we waited for a table. He never refilled our water glasses & we had to ask the bus person for coffee after we asked Matt 4 times. He then showsed up & said he was busy! Please note that I  have never posted before but at $65.00 for breakfast the service should have been better then what we received. He never asked if our food was good - which my hash & eggs were not and had he been attentive he would have  known. We are not picky people but water & coffee...come on!
