LQ_gYNs5E10IGFE0NOyD7A I don't normally write reviews on yelp but the upton stood out during our meal tonight. Not only was the food amazing (the Chinese ribs were as good as they describe them) but their service was top notch. The waiters knew everything about the drinks and the menu and were very attentive. We were sitting out on their awesome patio when the dust storm hit and it hit the patio pretty hard. They went above and beyond to make it up to everyone for something that they had no control over. Everything we tried was great - Chinese ribs, pork tacos, shishito peppers, sous vide steak, and 2 of their signature cocktails. Also their happy hour menu is a steal! I am a harsh critic and I was very impressed by this place. Will definitely be back to try even more of the menu!
