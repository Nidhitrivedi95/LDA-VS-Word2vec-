I had the grass fed Neu York strip.  It was cooked to perfection.  I choose the peppercorn sauce, and it was a nice addition, but not needed.

I went with the Mac and Cheese, that is a large portion, but really could be eaten by a single person.  I have no idea how they get every macaroni to stand on edge!  It's a neat presentation, and tastes fantastic.

Insider tip: sub the potato purée for the fries.  The fries are good, but you can get good fries anywhere.
