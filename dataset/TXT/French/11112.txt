4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw My friends and I decided to try this restaurant for breakfast after hearing great reviews. Overall, the food and service was great. However, they brought my friend the wrong entree. She still loved the one they brought, so they took her coffee and her husband's coffee off of the bill. As we were paying the bill, one of the servers was clearing the table next to us and a glass shattered on the ground, sending shards towards myself and another guy at our table. I ended up with a cut on my leg that was bleeding for several minutes as they sent a manager over. I told them I was fine, which I was. However, I found it a bit disappointing that  my calm response was met with no offer to make it right. Especially when they offered a discount after simply bringing someone the wrong entree. After all, if I had made a big deal out of it, they probably would have at least offered to discount the bill. Seems like only bad behavior is rewarded these days.
