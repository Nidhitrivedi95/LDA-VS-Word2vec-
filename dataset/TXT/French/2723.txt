0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g Been here twice and enjoyed the great food immensely.  It's definitely one of the best fine dining restaurants in Vegas. The paintings on the wall are said to be genuine Pablo Picasso's work. If you are lucky you get to sit by the window and enjoy the stunning night view of Bellagio's water fountain.

The frie gras was magnificent and the wagyu steak is to die for. Their caviar comes with the whole package: mini toast, creme fraiche, egg yolks, chives.... it is absolutely divine!

Everything in Picasso is perfect. The food, wine, the dessert..., and the staff.

Oh the Master Sommelier Robert knows his game. Trust him for wine recommendation and tell him your budget, he won't let you down.
