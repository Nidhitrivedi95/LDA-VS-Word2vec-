u-SvRRAfYgpbXZRfQgcTzA I've been to Imadake several times and have introduced it to many friends.  It's unanimous: This eatery is all about good food.  My favs are the white fish carpaccio with ponzu, the black cod, tofu salad and of course the yummy Ramen noodles in thick soup broth.  Prices are very reasonable and you can't beat the atmosphere of a Japanese pub and the shout outs of sake bombs.  Beware: noise levels on weekends late nights not for the mild-mannered diner.
