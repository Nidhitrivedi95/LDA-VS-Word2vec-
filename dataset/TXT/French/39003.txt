jLxeBgWhLRbII2ACkgH1Sg Disorganized and a little disappointing. I ordered croissant and cafe au lait together but waited long over 5 mins for the coffee....that just sat on the counter without any attempt to find it's owner :(. When I stood back in line to find out where my coffee was, another customer asked if I was still waiting for coffee, too. She also mentioned that she probably would not return - I'm I'm the same boat. The croissant is super beautiful and flaky but lacks depth of taste. I was looking forward to the buttery creamy taste, but didn't find it here.  I had high hopes...
