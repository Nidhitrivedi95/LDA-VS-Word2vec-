rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w Good, and therein lies the problem, it was just "good".  We travel to Vegas frequently and have wanted to try Le Cirque for quite some time and never had the opportunity. We finally were able to make time and we were anxiously awaiting the experience. We opted for the Prix Fixe menu and the wine pairing that accompanied it (3 course), $150 pp which is completely reasonable, we thought.  

We thought everything was "good", but that was the extent of it.  We had the Escargot, Sea-Bass, Chicken and Creme Brulee.  Again, everything was "good", but we could not honestly recommend any of these items.  The 3 wine pairings with each meal were different per entree, but none were worth the equivalent of $16 per glass or however the breakdown worked out (3 glasses for $50).

The best thing about the meals were the mini-desserts and "red box" treats.  What am I supposed to do with that "red box" now???

I have no problem paying $400 for an exceptional meal, unfortunately this was not that type of experience!

Sincerely disappointed!!
