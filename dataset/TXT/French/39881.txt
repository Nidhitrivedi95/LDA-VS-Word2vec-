K64Uw3a2Enh2MznpwRHWKQ We went with great expectations and were ....well, "underwhelmed".  We started with the stuffed shrimp appetizer, which was utterly delectable.  The bread basket was delish as well, and I actually appreciated the small serving as I would have absolutely eaten more & ruined my appetite!  I used Howard Seftel's reviews and ordered the Bouillabaisse, and my husband ordered the Arroz con Pollo.  My dish was quite nice - tasty, chock full of great seafood.  Fully met my expectations, but nothing to go on and on about.  The Arroz con Pollo however, was bland, the rice was gooey & overcooked, and the promise of flavor from the sausage & shrimp never quite materialized.  So disappointing....we'll be taking Razz's off our "special evening out" list - the over $100 bill was definitely not worth it, even with the tasty Bouillabaisse & appetizer.
