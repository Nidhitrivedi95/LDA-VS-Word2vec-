rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Review for breakfast only.

One the best breakfasts I've ever had. Delicious!  Lovely presentation. Nice ambiance with the bistro decor. Friendly staff. Short wait for a table. Very expensive for breakfast, but worth it as a treat. Wasn't loving that they tried to seat my family in a dark corner next to the busy drink station, but they moved us to a nicer table in a sunny location upon request. We also got pastries to go that were delicious. I would go back for breakfast for sure.
