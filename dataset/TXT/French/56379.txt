rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Thanks Thomas Keller for the amazing dining experience! Decided to do Valentine's Day early this year with the lady. Where to start of with this place..

#1 The butter was simply amazing. I didn't ask, but I would've believed them if they told me the butter was freshly churned. 

We started off with the beignets, and frites. My God, these beignets were simply delightful. Gorgeously fried, with an amazing filling, and the fries were delish! Ask for a side of the roasted garlic aioli, and ketchup! The aioli was perfect compliment to the fries. 

I had the trout, and the GF had the scallops. Simply amazing! Trout was filled with a cauliflower and garlic crouton stuffing broiled to perfection. The scallops were amazing. Perfect, juicy, and tender. We shared a side of brussel sprouts that were sauteed and broiled in pancheta and olive oil.

Drank Paul Bara all through out the night.

If you don't order booze, your wallet wont be too overly busted!
