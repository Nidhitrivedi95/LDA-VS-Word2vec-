XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q Went to this place twice and I am so so disappointed with the food. I tried the tasting menu and ala carte as well. Each dinner cost me 600 per person and the food was not good. Nothing special at all!. My first trip here was a huge disappointment but they are in top 50 restaurant in the world... So, i figure that i should go again..

Second trip was worse... service is pretty slow, people are quite nice tho... Had the tasting course... most of the food are sweet and had an asian/chinese twist in it. Well, I am Chinese, I don't want to pay 600 bucks for French-Chinese Food!!!.... 

Great decor... I give them credit for that, lots of wine selections as well. Other than that, I m so not coming back... Sorry... I am traumatized..
