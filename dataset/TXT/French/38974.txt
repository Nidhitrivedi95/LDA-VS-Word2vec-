jLxeBgWhLRbII2ACkgH1Sg Came here too late.  They were sold out of all the favorites. I wanted to try cannelés and almond croissant that everyone is raving about. Apparently they sell out quick. My crepes were good.  Vol au vent could use little more sauce other than that good. All the pastries I got was little dried out but tasty. I guess I have to come here in the morning. Loll
