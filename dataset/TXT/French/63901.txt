T4shscbr3BU3yb6EA3BSfA Came here based on a friend's recommendation. It's a very nice, cozy place. Sat at the bar and the bartender was super nice and knowledgable about the menu. I asked if I could order a drink off the menu and he said yes but when I asked for a French 75 he told me they didn't have any simple syrup. What kind of bar doesn't have simple syrup?! Ended up ordering wine and it was fine. 

The food: had the veal tartare as appetizer and it was different, slightly sweet but very good. Ordered the linguini with mussels and chicken skin for main. Again, different but tasty. Dessert was pecan tart. But what's up with the portions? They only use half the plate in every dish! For these prices, I expected bigger portions. You shouldn't leave a restaurant after paying almost $100 still hungry!
