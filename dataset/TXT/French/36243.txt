It's a really cute old school dinner with a new twist. The name, as it implies, indicates that you can add foie gras to any dish for $9.95! Because I went for breakfast, I didn't try this. 

It's a relatively small place so going a little earlier would probably be best to avoid lines. My sister and I went at around 11:30 AM and got a spot right away, but the place was already pretty filled and it was a freezing cold day. 

I ordered the ham eggs benedict - a classic and always good. Next time I'd probably want to try the truffle spaghetti, it sounded amazing! My sister opted for something more original and got the roasted vegetables and goat cheese tart. It was very beautifully plated and quite delicious. 

This is definitely somewhere I'd want to try again!
