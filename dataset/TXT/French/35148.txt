HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw My expectations were pretty high for this place given that it has a nice modern decor, is helmed by Chef David Myers, and had a couple of friends hyping this place up.  

Needless to say by my rating, this place sucked pretty bad.  Let me give you a little run down...

The burger was ordered medium but it was WAAAAY overcooked, not even pink in the center.  It was so overly salted that I couldn't even enjoy the meat.  The cole slaw that they slap on top didn't help either, relegating this burger to Diner status, all 20 dollars of it.

The escargot was mediocre.  Although they try to trick you by giving you 15 escargots in one dish, all of them are flavorless and dry.  Could it hurt you to add a little bit more butter?  Even a hint of garlic would have helped ...

The lamb shank was pretty tasty.  It's fall of the bone tender and was seasoned correctly.  One extra star for this dish.

Currently, if you check-in on foursquare, you get a free dessert.  I opted for something bizarre so I chose the Olive Oil Parfat.  This was very tasty but I wouldn't want to pay $10 for this tiny little thing... (that's what she said?)

Service was decent, but it seemed that the waiter didn't really care too much...just seemed like he wanted the day to end quickly.  

I would definitely recommend that you pass on this expensive eatery, it's not worth the money.
