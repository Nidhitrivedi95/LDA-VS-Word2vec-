mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q I'm very happy that we went and had this experience.  It's absolutely a box checked on the Vegas bucket list, but it's nothing we will ever do again.

Absolutely defined by the use of foie gras - which is a good thing if you enjoy animal torture, and a bad thing if you don't.  It's in numerous dishes, and without it, the restaurant isn't any better than other more creative spots at MGM.

Certainly try the Cap of Beef Ribeye, and give the sommelier a try (the best I've encountered in Vegas).  Stay away from the Iberico ham (this was almost insulting), and tartar, which was poorly prepared and displayed.

We're not too disappointed, as this place is more of a spectacle than a restaurant.  I would have expected a bit more, but I'm okay with my mediocre once-in-a-lifetime experience.  Just know that you're not going for the food, you're going because it's Robuchon, and enjoy!
