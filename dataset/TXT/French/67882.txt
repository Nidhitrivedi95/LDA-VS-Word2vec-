V0iYi5OjdRcz82m95jV7vQ OOOh la la!  So happy to have found this bakery and so happy it is walkable from my apt!  Can't wait to go back.  

Everything is fresh without preservatives so I don't recommend stocking up.  It's a place to consume that day...or shop frequently.  The quiches (traditional Lorraine and Spinach) were creamy and rich without being super greasy.  The appe tart was fantastic.  The macaroon were my lure.....mmmmmmmm.  Small with a big flavor...you don't need more.  It's easy to see why the French eat well and stay slim...the small macaroon satisfies the craving for sweet deliciousness that an entire bag of prepackaged cookies (like Oreos) can't.

The special coffee frother wasn't working, but the coffee snob in our group had a cup of their regular and loved it.  Didn't want to go get special coffee somewhere else as he had originally begged to do.  And the helpful clerk said they were working on having the frother work so perhaps when you go you can get the café au lait.  

The pastry chef did come out and check on the display so he's a real French chef, not a machine.

It's going to cost more than mass produced goods, and it's not going to last as long...but your taste buds will appreciate it SSOOOOOOO much more.  Allons - y
