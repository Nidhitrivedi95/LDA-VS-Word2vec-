8ciT6qjI18x9EPtOb-gqYQ My Fiance and I have been coming here for the last 3 years. Food and service is as advertised. Its a bit on a expensive side but we're firm believers that you get what you pay for. Their fillet has to be one of the best in town. Every time we go they pare it differently and I love that. The old building was small and romantic, can't wait to visit the new building. It's a must try on a special ocassion!
