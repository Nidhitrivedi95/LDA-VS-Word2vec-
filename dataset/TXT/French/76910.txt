I used to walk right past this place without noticing it. 

I've only tried it once but I doubt I'm going to go back. The atmosphere is nice. It reminds me of cafes in South Park, SOMA. Strange thing is, I think Paris 66 costs more for less quality & quantity. 

I had a savory crepe and was surprised that it was $10. If you're from the Bay Area you probably know Crepevine. The portions at Crepevine are generous (with salad and potatoes) and it tastes great for less than $10. Also, I'm not a fan of Paris 66's wheat crepes that they use for their savory crepes. I only ate the filling.

If you're in Pittsburgh and crave savory crepes I advise looking online for a recipe for crepe batter and filling them with chicken, tomatoes, and feta.
