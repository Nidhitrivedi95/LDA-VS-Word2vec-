4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Been to Mon Ami Gabi several times and I have to say that everything has always been excellent.
Food is excellent and flavors have always been very consistent.
You cant beat the price for the quality that your getting.
If you get the opportunity to sit on the patio in the evening, it brings everything together.
