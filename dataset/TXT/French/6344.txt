4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw We come to this restaurant quite a bit for breakfast every time we are in Vegas about 5 times a year. They have this ridiculous dress policy that men cannot wear sleeveless shirts but women can. I personally believe this is very sexist and pretentious. This is Las Vegas for god's sake! It gets hot here people! I understand maybe for dinner but not for breakfast! they give you the option to wear a cheap plain white crew neck t shirt (only avail XLarge mind you). Half of the women sitted at the patio that morning were wearing sleeveless clothes. Never coming back here again and will surely spread this word whenever I can!
