4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Everyone in my party got a steak, but with different sauces. They were all ok. Steak is thin but tender. The bordelaise sauce was a bit too sweet. The frites were delicious, like extra fried in n out fries. We also shared mussels and they were pretty good.

Although not bad, not really 4 star worthy on yelp, especially given the price. Nothing extremely memorable about the food. Would have been nice to sit outside. Service was great though.
