eJ9L40jm5VOXCIq7xs9kQw Went for an 8pm dinner with some friend after watch Alegria.  Everything started off well enough, the food was good and service was fine. after the appetizer for  the Table d'hote, we didn't see our waiter again at our table until we had to flag him down at the end of the night.  In his place was what seemed to be the bus boy or something.  This guy did not replace the steak knife that he had removed with the appetizer, he did not refill water until dessert, he took forever to take our dessert order, he didn't bring sugar/cream with the coffee or tea and took forever to get us our bill.  Overall, we spent close to 3 hours for dinner when it should have taken only 2.  I was not pleased with this as we still had to drive back to Ottawa and work the next morning.

The food was definitely worth it, but the service was severely lack from what I thought was a nice establishment
