rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Simply one of the best dinning experiences I've had this year. The chicken and waffles, beignets, oysters, and bloody mary (the best bloody mary I've ever had. Not too thick, not too strong, not too spicy, wasn't loaded with a bunch of condiments, it was perfection! And I'm not even into bloody mary's) and the service was superb. Definitely, looking forward to dining out here again during my next visit to Vegas. #onfleek
