rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w The food is very good and the service is top notch.  Bread was very good, kobe beef appetizer fantastic... mashed potato side was excellent.  Not much of a wine drinker (prefer good vodka) and didn't get stuffy attitude when we didn't order a bottle of vino.  

Get a seat closer to the windows facing the fountains for the best view.  A little disappointed with the interior decor, but maybe it was because I was spoiled by staying at the Encore...

Bottom line- we ate here based on Yelp reviews and can't say I would go back given the number of other fine restaurants in Vegas.  You won't be disappointed, but you won't leave saying that it's one of the best meals you've ever had.
