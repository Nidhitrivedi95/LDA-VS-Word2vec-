A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g I love everything here.. Its a great place to stop by with friends and have a good conversation. It is a sweet tooth's heaven. They have all their Macarons, Cakes, Tartes, Creme Brulees etc. all out on display, It was my first time so I was pretty overwhelmed and excited! They have the most incredible cakes here! Pistachio Macarons and the Strawberry Tarte are to die for!!! I've only tried their lasagna and french hotdog from the regular menu so far and it was pretty tasty!:):):) This place gets busy at times, which is pretty understandable. Its a lovely place to chill and have a cup of coffee. I will definitely go back for more sweets! If you haven't been here I suggest you go now and get yourself a macaron!!!
