iEsNloJgy-MyA-_wqeB6jg I love it here! Love the owner, love the food, love the ridiculously dated decor! Love it! 
My husband and I went for the first time last Saturday and I cant wait to go back and try new dishes. 
The only rough part of the night was trying to discreetly google the menu and figure out what everything meant. We finally gave up and just asked the waiter, much easier! 
It just seems like its one server in charge of the whole place, so I kind of felt like we were bothering him with all our questions. He didn't make it feel like that, but I could just tell how busy he was. 
So for an appetizer we got the coquilles st jacques (sp?) and it was small but really good. Maybe that appetizer is always small? I have no idea! I got the lobster thermadore for dinner, it was really good. So buttery. Which is totally the way to my heart....buttery lobster...mmmm. My husband got the steak diane which is made table side and there's lots of flames and drama! It was pretty cool. It was cooked perfectly, and the sauce was AMAZING. I was pretty drunk from the bottle of wine at this point, so I think the chocolate souffle for dessert was awesome, but I'm not totally sure because I also think Taco Bell is awesome when I'm drunk. 
We were (by far) the youngest people there, but whatever. It was great and I want to go back. Tonight, preferably! We got a gift certificate from restaurant.com for $50 of $100 and with appetizers, wine, dinner, and dessert, the bill was about $200 after the $50 off. For sure get the coupon, next time, I'll get the $75 off of $150, because this place isn't cheap...
