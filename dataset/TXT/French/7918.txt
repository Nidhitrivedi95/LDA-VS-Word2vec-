4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I really like this place.  The service is excellent.  We had a delay and the waiter was incredible.  The food is very good, not great but very good.  You patio is always good because you get to people watch and the Bellagio water show.  You should definitely go with the steaks but the ladies liked the fish a lot too.
