4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Excellent excellent meal! Came here for a nicer meal with a group to celebrate 4 of our birthdays! We called ahead to make a reservation but ultimately was not needed since we ate there so late (10:30pm). We had the option to sit inside or on the patio and ofcourse we sat outside with a beautiful view of the Bellagio and the fountain show. Waitress was great and so friendly. The food was just delicious!! Cooked to perfection and amazing flavor. It came out quickly too. Will definitely be back the next time I'm in Vegas!
