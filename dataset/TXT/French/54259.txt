rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw Made a reservation for two, were quickly seated and sat for 10 minutes with no service, menus and drinks. My wife and I watched two waiters attend to our neighbors, while we managed to pour our own water. We left and asked the hostess for directions to another restaurant. Highly disappointed based on reviews and expectations of the brand.
