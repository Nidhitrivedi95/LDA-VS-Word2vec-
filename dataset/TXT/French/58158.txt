rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Dinner at Bouchon was good, but not exceptional.  

Oysters and clams had shell and sand... hmm.

While entrees are well-priced (for a high end restaurant in Vegas) at $17-$35, the specials were significantly more expensive (so make sure you ask) at $39 for the fish and $45 for the veal that night.  Not what you expect when the wait person does not tell you the price but just the specials of the evening.

The food was not spectacular like you'd expect a Thomas Keller restaurant to serve (maybe I just had high expectations) but was still by far excellent.  My husband ordered the steak frites and I thought it was really well prepared.  I had the trout, which also was cooked well, but I felt that I could make both dishes at home almost as good, if I used enough butter.

Wine list was a bit pricy.

I'd go again though, maybe to try their breakfast or brunch menu next time.  And one of these days I'll order the $45 pot of frie gras pate.
