Bouchon is my favorite place for breakfast in Las Vegas.  I've had breakfast here more than a dozen times, and still look forward to going.  I've also had dinner here once, and was very pleased.

Bouchon is very bright and cheerful. It combines formality with informality: tables are graced with white tablecloths, but a piece of white paper is placed on top; some men arrive in business suits, others in shorts.  This is a good place to bring your newspaper.  When the weather is nice, consider asking for a table outside.

I've found service to be efficient, friendly and relaxed.  However, I've read a couple of accounts which described inattentive service.  I haven't noticed this, but then not much service is needed at breakfast.



**Breakfast**
I've eaten my way through much of the menu:
*   French Toast Bouchon style.  It's a cylinder of something like sweet bread pudding, with apples, and a crisp glaze on top.  I thought it was good, but not memorable.  However, I seem to be in the distinct minority, as I continue to read rave reviews of the stuff.

*   My personal favorite is boudin blanc with scrambled eggs, croissant and beurre noisette.  Boudin blanc is a large white sausage, soft and smooth, with a distinct acidic tang.  It's unusual enough that the server sometimes cautions you if you order it, but I think it's delicious.  The scrambled eggs are a perfect example of what I mean by "simple food, prepared very well."  The eggs are standard scrambled eggs - but are delicious:  cooked through but still soft and creamy, with lots of flavor.  The croissant has varied between very good and truly excellent.

*   Omelet with chicken, piquillo peppers, onion confit, tarragon and swiss cheese; sausage links served on the side.  This was a daily special.  The sausage was very good, although no match for the boudin blanc.  The omelet was really good.  The egg was cooked through but still soft; light but not too airy; rich.  The tarragon flavor was strong but not overpowering.  There was a lot of onions, soft but not squishy.  The chicken was not dry.  Lastly, there were two thick half slices of toasted brioche.  A winner!

*   Steak hash with eggs any style, and brioche toast.  Another daily special.  The hash was very good, with lots of tender diced steak.  The scrambled eggs were well prepared, and I liked their brioche a lot.  Again, simple food prepared very well.

*   Croque Madame.  Toasted ham and cheese sandwich on brioche (a rich bread made with eggs and butter), with a fried egg and mornay sauce on top; served with a mountain of french fries.  I know it sounds a little strange, but it's very good.

*   Waffles with strawberries and applewood smoked bacon.  The waffles were light and fairly crisp.  The bacon wasn't as crispy as I would have liked, but the flavor was very good.

*   Bouchon's croissant is always worth ordering, as are the sweet pastries.  The one I remember the most was a blueberry muffin, flavored with blueberry juice and with bits of fruit, and a top made crunchy by a glaze of sugar.

*   Yogurt parfait.  Rich and creamy yogurt, crunchy home made granola, and fresh berries.  The one time I ordered this, the yogurt was very good, but the berries were unripe and too sour.  Perhaps I'll give it another try someday.



**Dinner**
I've only eaten dinner here once.  It was a little more animated, and a little noisier, than at breakfast.  My meal consisted of:
*   Beignets de Brandade de Morue.  Three small balls of mashed cod, covered in a thin coating, and fried.  In essence, a grown up cod fish cake.  Very, very good.
*   Braised Lamb Shank.  This was a special, recommended by the server.  It was a large piece of meat, so soft it fell off the bone.  Served on a bed of potato puree, along with micro chives, capers, lots of garlic cloves, and pimiento strips.  The lamb flavor was strong, the garlic soft and sweet.  Also very good.
*   Pommes Frites.  There was no need to order them, but I had heard such good things about Bouchon's French fries that I had to give them a try.  They were good French fries, but I was a little disappointed.  Perhaps all the hype made for unrealistic expectations.
*   Bouchons.  Three small chocolate morsels, like brownies but crisp on the outside, soft on the inside.  The chocolate flavor was dark and intense.  Served with a small scoop of vanilla ice cream, it earned its name.
*   Mignardises.  A few sweets at the end of the meal.  This is becoming more and more common, and is a nice touch.

When I first read the menu, I was underwhelmed.  There were no knock-your-socks-off fancy dishes.  However, like breakfast, the chef concentrated on simple dishes, and executed them very well.  This was a very good meal indeed.




A trip to Las Vegas wouldn't be the same without at least one breakfast at Bouchon.  I always leave in a good mood, ready for the rest of the day.
