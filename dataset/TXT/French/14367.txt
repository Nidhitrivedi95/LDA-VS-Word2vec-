5BAdubSKMARs3qYRHGaClA I did expect somewhat overpriced food considering the location and the great views it has of Old Montreal. However the food was not only sub-par, but tasted really bland and just plain bad. And the horrible service didn't help either. All in all just a disappointing experience.
