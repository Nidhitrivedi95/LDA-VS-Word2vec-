P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ The result proved disappointing. Unfortunately, I have traveled a lot in the world, so this restaurant level is just OK, nothing amazing or outstanding sadly. 
Food is lower than average. I mean, one dish is good, but other dish isn't delicious at all... All dish is uneven. I thought their famous "Artichoke Soup with Parmesan and Truffles" no doubt that's delicious, but it wasn't delicious. It is flabby. That's too bad.
And Service is too formal, customers cannot be relaxed in this situation at all, Because nobody smiling when we questioned them. They did just answer with very serious face and eagerly. It was stifling. Formal service may not be careful that cannot be said as a rule. I think They have to make something that the customer can be enjoy with meals, but they give us overpowering feeling from incapable of flexibility. Surely they can not see the joke. 
Actually, It is strange to get a star of Michelin. Their performance was nothing special. Interior is very simple,I mean it depends on personal preferences, their interior like a in office or in a slightly witty station.It is just too simple. 
We can eat more delicious meals in France with more lower budget. 
If I pay this amount of money, I'd like to go to different restaurants in Las Vegas.
