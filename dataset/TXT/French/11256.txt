4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Made a RSVP for 11.30, got there early looking to sit on the patio on this beautiful day.  The hostess were friendly and seemed like they were happy to be there. They were happy to oblige on a patio table, perfect for people watching and the Bellagio fountains across the way.  Chris greeted us promptly and offered the breakfast menu as an option. We were happy for the breakfast option, although lunch was what we mainly ordered.

We frequently visit Mon Ami Gabi and every time we come here, the service is wonderful, the food is consistent, and ambiance is awesome. Chris made our visit, this time, very welcoming, which compelled us to review this visit. He joked with us, very attentive yet unimposing, he even poked fun at my Lover's Chicago Cubs team, rightfully so. A nice touch to personalized service and interaction with his guests, not just with us, but all of his tables, we truly appreciate that!! We also noticed Chris being a definite team player, not just servicing his tables, but cleaning and resetting his own and the other tables around him.  Bravo Chris, we'll definitely will be back to see you!
