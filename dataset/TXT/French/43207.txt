lQ9VmIWvM6v-rONPkYX8aQ Best overall dining experience in Vegas - hands down! If you take the time to read my entire review you'll find I didn't find very dish to be drop dead amazing, but honestly the "extras", service and atmosphere make up for some dishes being a 9 instead of a 10!

I was with a party of 8, we all did the 3 courses for $125. 

Platter of mini appetizers:
This came shortly after we sat down and was "free". We each got our own adorable mini platter. It contained beef tartare, roasted red pepper soup, a veal fried ball, tempura lobster, and foie gras! WOW. Even the ones that don't sound good were good.. trust me :)

Amuse bouche:
Surprised we got one of these after the awesome platter, but we did! It was smoked salmon on a blini with a poached quail egg. MMM

Course 1:
Butter poached crab with risotto. Really really good, but the poached crab at Bradley Ogden is better. Sorry, I'm bratty. The scallops were the best of the Course 1 choices.. I stole one from my neighbor . 

Course 2:
Wagyu beef rossini. Luckily I know rossini = foie gras = heaven, so I knew this was the dish for me . The beef was very good, but honestly the beef I had at sage the night before was better. The perfectly prepared foie gras and beautiful gnocchi on the plate made it overall an excellent dish. 

Course 3:
Only the best dessert I've had in my entire life. Banana filled beignets.. and chocolate cake.. and peanut butter ice cream.. all in on one plate. AMAZING. I can still taste it.. AHH. I'm not a dessert person, but this really was incredible. 

We were then showered with petite pastries (like in Paris!), hot madelines, and the girls got a box of cookies. Overall a magical evening I look forward to repeating the next time my husband and I have $250 burning a hole in our pockets!
