udFcIcbWbxrO8uLF95WnQg The Zack Bruell restaurants are split pretty evenly in my mind: I love Parallax and L'Albatros, but Chinato and Table 45 fall pretty flat. Cowell & Hubbard walks the midline. I've been here twice (once on Valentine's Day and once on a random Friday night). Both times the service has been outstanding! I love how friendly and attentive everyone is, regardless if its one of the busiest nights of the year or just any other Friday night.

On my recent visit, I tried the following:

- Shrimp and lobster bisque: This soup is HEAAVVY....and not entirely in a good way. It's certainly flavorful and fun with corn and potatoes adding nice texture to the creamy soup, but it's just WAAY TOO heavy and full to be a good appetizer. I felt like I'd instantaneously coated my blood vessels with plaque and signed up for a pant size increase! 

- Seafood dumplings: Best dumpling I've ever had! You must order this! You can never go wrong with a dish that has pickled veggies in it...I wish I could pickle everything in sight ARHGH! 

- Spicy Bouillabaisse: I ordered this because I saw a lady at the next table eating it. Boy I wish I had paid more attention to the fact that she really wasn't eating much of it at all! This dish was SO SALTY. I've never been subjected to such an assault on my senses!! Same comments about coating blood vessels apply here (see shrimp and lobster bisque). I took most of this home as leftovers and had to add some heavy cream to cut down the saltiness and add back some creamy flavor (ignore comment about blood vessels....the heavy cream was necessary in this instance!) 

- Rabbit Gnocchi: My beau ordered this and it was fantastic! The gnocchi were deliciously cheesy and creamy and the rabbit had a similar presentation and flavor profile to pulled pork. The rabbit was a little on the salty side, but the gnocchi cut the sodium high pretty well. 

*Tip: BYOB like all the Zack Bruell restaurants (except for Table 45).
