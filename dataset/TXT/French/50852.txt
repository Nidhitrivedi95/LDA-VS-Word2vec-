oZHbPhIj01_31jqD053a_Q We went to Europea for their lunch. For $35, it was a truly amazing gastronomical experience. 
Upon arrival, I was amazed by the interior decor, it was as fancy as a Michelin starred restaurant. The service was also impeccable, the server took my coat and my shopping bag. 
We first got the complimentary beef jerky, then the lobster cappuccino, the salmon starter followed by the scallop and ended with a dessert of your choice. 
I have to say, all the dishes were very creative and presentable, which elevated the entire dining experience. However, even though the dishes were feast to my eyes, not very much to my tastebuds. There are other restaurants in Montreal with better tasting food. And their dessert were lacking flavours. 
Still, I would definitely come back to Europea, I enjoy their artistic touch to every single dish, their classy ambience, amazing service and just a fantastic meal with friend. 
Strongly recommend this restaurant if you don't feel like joining the tourists in old Montreal.
