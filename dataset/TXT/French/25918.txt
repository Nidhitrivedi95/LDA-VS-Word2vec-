cVMfoJJ4ki427wSAmNvJAw One of my favourite places to go for dinner in Mississauga. Every time I have been there the food as been excellent. In fact, I think the worst we ever had was when the garlic mashed potatoes were merely "good" - rather than outstanding. It was a suprise to us more than anything else.

I quite like the atmostphere there with the high ceilings and nice decor. I've usually found it to be very quiet inside. The staff there are great and they always seem to be extremely happy and helpful.

I often go for their steaks, but the pork tenderlion is excellent as well.

Addendum: The same day that I posted this review, I discovered that Rosewood is now closed. How sad.
