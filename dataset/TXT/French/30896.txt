fyJAqmweGm8VXnpU4CWGNw I had bookmarked French Grocery awhile back and was in the area and some time to kill, so I pulled up the address on Yelp App and made my over there.

The French Grocery, is more of a bistro/wine bar, not really a grocery, but please don't let that stop you from checking it out, because it does have plenty to offer.

When I traveled to France the one thing I wanted most was cheese, bread and wine, and now after checking this place out, I see I don't have to wait too long to get it. They have fresh bread, croissants, so many cheeses, French and American, so many to choose from, I just need to invest in a raclette grill and I will be one happy girl!

They also have some amazing looking desserts, custards, éclairs, beignets, pastries, macarons, tarts. Everything looking equally delish, but I walked away with  1/2 dozen of macarons, which my house loved, even my 2 year old grandson, who is very picky.

They have a nice wine selection too, bottles range in price, oh the bistro looks like it would make a cute date night/lunch spot too. Looking forward to my next trip back.
