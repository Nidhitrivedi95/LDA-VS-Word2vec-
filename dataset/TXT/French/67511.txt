UxWH8zRYIBgs6Q2oykvRdw Went for brunch on a Saturday, and was very disappointed with the experience.  The omelette I ordered was drowning in a pool of oil, so I tried one bite and pushed it aside.  I looked for the server so that I could order something else, but nowhere to be seen.  With her ability to disappear like that, perhaps the server is better suited for a career in espionage.  

The server didn't return to our table until long after my dining companion had finished both a French onion soup, and a full breakfast.  The server cleared my completely full plate (minus just one bite) without asking anything!  It was now too late for me to order anything else (my companion had already finished eating both of her plates a while ago), so we paid and left.

- this was the first time in my life that I paid for a meal and then went immediately somewhere else to get something to eat (I was starving!)

- Brunch for two came to $64.36 (no alcohol).  At that price point I would expect to eat something.  Anything.  God I was so hungry when I left.  I would also expect the obligatory 3-bite check in ("how is everything?") that even crappy pubs do.  

- Only two times in my entire life have I left no tip.  This was one of those times.
