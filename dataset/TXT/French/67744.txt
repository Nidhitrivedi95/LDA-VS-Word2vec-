UxWH8zRYIBgs6Q2oykvRdw Came here for dinner. The decor and ambiance is really nice here - comfy seats too.
Service was so slow though :( 
It took 45 mins from the moment we sat down to order our food - and that doesn't  include our wait for the food. But it was okay because our group was really chatty so it didn't feel as long haha

Drinks:

CLUNY SANGRIA (3/5)

Appetizers:

SPICY SALMON TARTAR 3.5/5
I love avocado so I liked this.. would've liked it more if they added more avocado (Personal preference!)

BEEF POUTINE 3/5
The fries were good, reminded us of the hickery sticks

RICE FLOUR FRIED FROG'S LEGS 4/5
Frog legs tastes like chewy chicken for the ones who haven't tried frog legs before!
This was really good :) Would definitely recommend this if you're looking for a small appetizer.

Mains:

9 OZ TOP SIRLOIN 2/5 
I should have gotten the lamb because this has got to be the driest (and rather tasteless..) sirloin ever... The sirloin was basically the "side dish" and the fries became my main because it tasted so much better haha
