OYHpqY6-3C-wXR-uPbHhwA The food here is great! I had the 1/2 lb. "Honey" burger with the onion rings and the burger was the best! Thick, juicy, delicious! Remember the old burger places that hand formed their patty and it was thick and flavorful? You're in for a treat here. The onion rings also seemed hand dipped and spiced well. My daughter ordered the mac and cheese made with Brie and (I believe) cheddar cheese. I had one bite just to try it and WOW! I'm definitely ordering that next trip in! My family and I will be back here as my new favorite. The owner / chef seems very professional but has to work in a very cramped kitchen (poor guy!). Pumpkin pie gelato  was very good, also.

Let me tell you about the service....The young man that served us was genuinely interested in giving us quality service and product. He was on top of refilling our drinks and we were left to want for nothing. 15% - 20% tip recommended if you get him!
