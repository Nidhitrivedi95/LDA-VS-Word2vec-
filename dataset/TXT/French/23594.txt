cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg Be sure to make reservations at least a month in advance. I'll preface this by saying this place is probably on my list of top ten restaurants. We started off with onion soup and fois gras Poutine as appetizers...omg soo rich yet soo good! The onion soup had chunks of pork in it! I tasted a hint of beer as well. The flavors worked so well together. Next came our entrees which took about an hour. At first I was pretty annoyed but then got over it because I really needed the hour to digest from my appetizers to make room for my entree. I ordered the duck in the can. I decided to focus on the meat and nothing else because there was no way I could eat the entire entree. It was excellent. My BF got the stuffed pig leg with fois gras. If you plan on getting this please be advised this is probably a 3-4 person dish. My boyfriend barely put a dent in it before he asked them to wrap it up for him. My cousin got the bison ribs...it was HUGE!!! Very tasty!!! My other cousin got the fois gras burger which she wasn't too crazy about. A great bonus was the fact that we got to meet Martin Picard himself!!! He was soo friendly even allowed me to take a picture with him. If it wasn't for the slow service I would've given au pied cochon five stars however honestly the food definitely made up for it!!! Can't wait to come back for more!!!
