fVF5wayDyY6ZR5oJB1IK3g The most amazing scones I have ever had the pleasure of tasting. A Must for brunch aficionados. The scrabble was amazing as was the smoked salmon scrambled eggs. Will be back for the French toast. They have a bakery a few doors down for any take home needs you may have. Ie scones!
