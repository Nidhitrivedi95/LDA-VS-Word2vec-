XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q I am 26 years old and if I live to at least 70, I plan on eating at Joel Robuchon at least 44 more times in my life. Seriously, I can't stop dreaming about the cheese cart. And the caviar with crab and fennel. And the tartar. I don't think I've ever tasted such creamy deliciousness in my life!!

Given the bajillion of reviews before mine, I don't really have anything to add...except that they do not limit you in the number of breads or cheeses you can choose from their giant carts. 

I'll be seeing you again Joel Robuchon...just like one is supposed to set aside part of their income to buy a house, I'm setting mine aside for a once a year trip to Vegas to eat at you again.
