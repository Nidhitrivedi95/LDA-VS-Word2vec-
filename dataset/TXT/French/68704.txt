A friendly staff will welcome you and, if you wish, be your guide through your culinary journey. 

Try to get a seat at the bar, you'll see your food (and everyone else's) being expertly prepared by the cooks as you're enjoying a glass of wine from their great selection.

Everything is always fresh and prepared to perfection. Seasonal meals and classics share the blackboard: the cauliflower, the octopus, the deer, the lobster pie all come highly recommended from this reviewer, but I've never tried anything I didn't like.

Don't miss this gem, you shan't be disappointed!
