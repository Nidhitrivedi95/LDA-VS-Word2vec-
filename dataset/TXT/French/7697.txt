After waiting on 2 other tables who were seated after me one girl finally asked "ummm, has anyone waited on you yet?"  I hate being ignored when there's empty tables all around. Croque Madam was tasty & it's served w/thin crispy frites. Sandwich and one Kir Royale (chambord & champagne) was $29 so it's not super reasonably priced.
