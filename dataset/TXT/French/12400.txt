4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I come here just about every time I'm in Vegas and the place is consistently awesome.  

Waiters are well trained, courteous, and will do anything to make you happy.  

Food, as you would expect, is delicious!  Brunch is served all day on weekends, so order yourself some french toast or waffles with fresh cream...  You won't regret it!  The sandwiches and salads are all delicately prepared and taste like heaven in your mouth.

Getting a table can often be a pain - if you come at the non-peak hours without a reservation, wait time is usually 15 minutes or so for indoor seating.  You used to be able to make reservations for the patio and get a guaranteed table there, but on our most recent trip we heard that was no longer the case.  A reservation will guarantee you a table, but the patio requires additional wait.  Call for details just to be sure.  I wasn't exactly "all there" when this was being explained ;)
