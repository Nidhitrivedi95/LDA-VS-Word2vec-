DJcvnN7BCiqOUAra35xYuA This is where you go, when you first go to that new ramen place down the street for lunch, only to find out they've run out of food.  They've run... out of food...  Didja catch that?

You know what I liked about this place?  It's in like a hotel lobby, so if you want to use the restroom, you have to walk into the lobby, past the front desk, around the corner and down the narrow hall... as opposed to the foodless ramen place, which has a restroom icons above a hallway, but when I pushed through the door, I ended up in the kitchen.  The look the workers gave me was like "hey buddy, you're not peeing in here.  You're not peeing anywhere"

You know what else I like?  The fillet meat in the pho was chunk meat, not thin slices.  And it was good.  Did you happen to see my photo?  That was a good photo, huh?  I had help
