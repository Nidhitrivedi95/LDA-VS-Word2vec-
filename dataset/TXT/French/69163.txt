w2tr0PA0b3tg8pId0kjM-A Macaroons are definitely a rare purchase for me, for the price, I can get 3 donuts which are my personal favorite. However, there's just something about the texture that I absolutely love, along with the unique flavors as well. 

First time I actually made it into this bakery, although I have had them before. Unique setup, friendly staff, and excellent sweets outside of the macaroons. I tried the lemon tartlette which was fantastic.

Macaroons will cost you about $2.25 a piece and are relatively small, but certainly not overpriced. Market District sells larger ones for about the same price and I enjoy them as well, but these guys win on flavor options alone.
