4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw This is my second time coming here. My first experience was good and everything was yummy, though I came for brunch so maybe its different. This time I came with my family for dinner and the food was mediocre but what really got me was the service, or should I say the server. I felt like she stereotyped us from the moment we sat down. She came by and took our orders, afterwards she never really returned to check up on us. We asked for medium +1 but we received a rare steak, we had to flag her down to get it corrected. At the end of the meal she didn't ask if we wanted dessert or anything but rather just dropped off the check and told us gratuity was already included. I guess for a party of 5 they include gratuity already. I was over this place by then, so we just paid the bill and left. I won't be coming back anymore.
