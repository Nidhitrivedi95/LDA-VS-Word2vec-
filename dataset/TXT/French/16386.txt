7Ug8zCmY6iDTewxWqeYQ2g Definitely one of the best BYOW in the city.. in fact, I really think it is the best!
Reservation is a must: 2 services : 6:30pm or 9:30pm. Group are also possible, but be careful, it is a small place and the windows very close, the noise can be very loud at one point.

I liked going to Quartier General for lunch, it is a sure bet. You can choose from different starters and main dishes on the menu. The waiters will present every meal one by one in a very delectable way. The hard thing is to choose 1 only. 
For the starter, they also have the Tartare du moment: Once got the duck, salmon, and the deer (my favorite).
You can also add an little extra to have the desert and 2nd starter. (worth it all the way) I am not a sweet tooth, but seriously it's the best desert I had (nougat glacé is a must!)

For the quality, the price is more than excellent!
Bring a good bottle of wine and enjoy your meal (tartare, meat, fish, risotto), with friends, bf, gf or family.
