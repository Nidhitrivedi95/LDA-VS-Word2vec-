XKPosZx2j4RHcZ8Ewdwj0A I prefer L'Express for food and ambience but Lemeac offered up a delicious dinner as well in a bistro-like atmosphere.  Their gazpacho was the best I've ever had, cool, sour, savory, and fresh all at once.  I had the crab cake as a small main course, but the tartar-sauce equivalent it came with was too mayonnaise-y for me and not salty enough and the crab cake felt dry and stringy without the sauce.  The cucumber salad that accompanied the crab cake was delicious and neatly presented by finely shredding the cucumber like vermicelli.  We ordered a side of green beans as a salad which popped with minced salad and just enough acidity.  The beans were very nicely prepared.

For dessert we shared a piece of brillat savarin -- my favorite cheese, and the piece Lemeac served was exactly as creamy as it should have been.  I highly recommend the Sauternes as well.
