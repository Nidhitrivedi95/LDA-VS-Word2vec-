AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw Quite disappointed in this place. I ordered an omelette which was quite good but came with a side of a salad... really a salad?

29$ later, I was left with a half full stomach and a salad.

Service was also pretty pitiful. Received my drink when I was swallowing the last bites of my meal. My water cup was filled once and sat empty.

Avoid this restaurant and keep walking.
