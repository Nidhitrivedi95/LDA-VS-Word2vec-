rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw beautiful place, with just right portions (albeit a little pricey). Have been 3x: twice during dinner and once during rose brunch - where the servers NEVER let my glass become under half full with rose!!! Same applies to my water glass! The service was supreme. The side of hash browns is delicious and so was the french toast that we all shared (several portions). There is a slight dress code for gentlemen so check on that - we came to booze it up right before Life is Beautiful festival so had to tell the guys no festival wear until after rose brunch ;)
