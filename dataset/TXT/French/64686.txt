teTQU7TIPE0O_B1zN_239w Food was okay but they change their menu too much. I like a dish but then when I return they no longer offer it. I like the bread they bring out ahead of time. You can also get muffins to go. This place is a hit or miss. I never know what I'm going to get when I come here. My server was so sweet though and always had a smile. The GM also checked in on us which is always a plus.
