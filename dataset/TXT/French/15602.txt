6fPQJq4f_yiq1NHn0fd11Q The crepes themselves were not bad, slightly undercooked but decent anyway. 

The sweet ones are better then the savory. 

I had the breakfast crepe. It was terrible, especially the bechamele. It still tasted flour. 

The fresh fruit crepe had too much sugar but other than that fine. 

I wouldn't eat here again.
