2zd-1R3CdnaMDXTAEVa2Qg I think I had the pork chop but I exchanged with the hubby's order which was grilled chicken because I liked it better. I wasn't really impressed. BUT we went there almost at closing time so the stuff they had were probably sitting there for hours now. I saw a lot of potential of what they would've have been had we gone earlier that day. Cuz even at their bad state, the pork chop and grilled chicken were still somewhat awesome. I think the piri piri sauce really elevated the taste too.
