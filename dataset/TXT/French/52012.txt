pmoIMK8zGWvKsVOPDBYfzg I decided to spend New Year Eve in Andre based on Yelp 4 star reviews even though some people did complain it's salty on fish or certain foods.

After trying their New Year Eve tasting menu, it's very disappointing.

None of the dishes made a lasting impression and the biggest problem was some of the dishes were way too salty.

The main course was roasted chicken filled with foie gras.  The sauce is way over salted that you can't taste foie gras or anything else inside.  Same goes for sweet pea soup with king crab.  The salt killed most flavors in the food.

It was $185 tasting menu dinner with wine and tips, $250.  Sad to say, this place is no where comparing to French Landry, and even for local popular French places in San Francisco bay area, I can have much better French food much lower price.  

I certainly will not go back there again.
