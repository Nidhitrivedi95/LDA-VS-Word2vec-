rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w For fine dining in an intimate setting, there is no other place in Vegas that rivals Le Cirque, and we like this place even more than the New York original. It's intimate, elegant and personal. Exquisite cuisine, consistently refined service and great drink and wine list. The chocolate and coffee bread was a bit sweet but original, the baguette a bit hard, while the brioche was
delicious. The citrus risotto was also original and delicious, and the chocolate soufflé is spot on.
