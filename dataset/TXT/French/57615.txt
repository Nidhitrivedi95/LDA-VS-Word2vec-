rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I have been to the Bouchon in Napa. This one is a close second. A restuarant in a casino does not compare to the original but the service, food and ambiance compares. The food was excellent. We started with the salmon riellete and oysters. I had the grilled sturgeon perfectly cooked. My freind had the lamb. He was pleased with it. I tried it, it was a little too pungent for me but had good flavor. We capped the meal off with some absinthe and a bowl of fresh berries. All in all a very good meal. It was my freinds first time eating there and his words were "I was blown away".
