aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw Maybe I'm crazy but when I visit a bakery that has a lot of hype I expect a bakery... Not a pop up shop looking store front with a small selection of pastry . To bad because the enormous macrons were Scrumptious but not enough to have me stop by again . There wasn't any seating or anyone willing to help me find the correct bakery spot if there was it is .
