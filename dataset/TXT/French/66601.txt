uP3H5bcsiTXM0k0xQhRndg Le Robin Square was the best restaurant I tried while visiting Montreal last month. Every single item of food that was brought to our table was delicious. I was worried because they didn't seem to have a ton of vegetarian options, but they let us get the mac and cheese with the pork on the side. I also split a beet salad and the burrata flat bread. The flat bread was really good and the salad was one of the best beer salads I've ever had. This visit started my new food obsession with burrata and I'll be Forever grateful to Le Robin Square for introducing me to this wonderful cheese. 

The restaurant is apparently family owned and it seemed like everyone working there was in a good mood. Our was very friendly (even after we spilt water all over the table) and great at her job. They also had a solid bottled beer selection.
