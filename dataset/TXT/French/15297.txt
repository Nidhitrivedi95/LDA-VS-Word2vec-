6fPQJq4f_yiq1NHn0fd11Q Not impressed.  My out-of-town friend and I were strolling in the Paris hotel when we got an urge for crêpes....saw La Creperie and decided to check it out.  First, we were the only ones ordering crêpes.  No excuses for poor or slow service, right?  Second, le monsieur at the window must have been having an off day because he didn't smile at all.  I have heard from reputable sources that French ppl are not the most gregarious of folk, but sheesh.  Would it kill ya to smile?  Third, our Napolean (lemon curd/berry) crêpes needed more curd.  There was only a teaspoon or so of the curd which translates to too many naked, dry crépe bites.  Perhaps I should try the savoury crêpes to compare? 

Our crêpes took longer than I thought to make, given the fact that there was no one else ordering anything.  Will I return?  Probably not.  Hélas.  Le sigh.
