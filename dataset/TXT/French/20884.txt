AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw So, we stayed at Caesars Palace and occasionally would walk inside to see the goodies that were out for the day and leave. We decided to have breakfast there and get some coffee and sweets. 
I didn't care for some of the attitudes of the employees working there. Not all of them had an attitude, on the contrary some were extremely sweet. However the cashier who rang us up just wasn't really friendly. 
I figured this place was expensive but we didn't want to go crazy and order everything that looks good so I asked how much a large coffee was. And she looked so annoyed that God forbid I asked about the price of something. So she responds, " a dollar more than the small". I don't see why you couldn't just tell me the price of the large. I don't even know what the price of the small is. I just didn't care for the way she responded. 
Anyway we ordered two coffees, a pistachio eclair, a blueberry muffin, and a berry crepe. The eclair was soooo good. The filling tasted like ice cream! It was delicious. The crepe was also really tasty. I would've been extremely pissed if we paid all that and the desserts weren't even good, but I must say the sweets we ordered were worth it.
