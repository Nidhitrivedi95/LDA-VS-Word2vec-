PqLYjUuzSIUU94emDWxwLg Loved this place the minute I first stepped inside and was even more in love once I experienced the quality and presentation of the food! Charming atmosphere and friendly service. I will definitely be back. Pro tip: do what I wasn't smart enough to do and eat some of the toppings off your tartine with a fork before trying to pick it up with your fingers. (The sandwich is fairly large and the wooden board, while lovely, is quite small, so it won't catch any of your droppings.)
