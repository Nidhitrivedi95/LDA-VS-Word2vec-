4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw This place is so ritzy! It's awesome, very gourmet, and french (I love the french). 

I went here for breakfast and ordered the Slow-Braised Beef Eggs Benedict, it was fantastic. So fresh, beautifully presented, and plainly incredible. 

I sat on the patio right off the strip, it was such a great setting, great vibe, a freaking great time. 

A bit pricey, but you pay for what you get and here you get it all. Amazing service, Delicious food, Beautiful decor, and Great people watching.
