50-xiTYmE6NERi-yJ6NvHw Last tuesday I went to Biff's Bistro with a few foodie friends to try their Vive Languedoc! menu. 

We were greeted with oysters and some refreshing libations inspired in the south of France (bien sur). Pastis with rosemary, sparkling water, and orange slices. Not bad huh?....Besides the fact that I hate Pastis and I am not very fond of rosemary, it was a hit! 

I usually do not eat oysters in Toronto but Biff's is usually a reliable source and I have never got sick after eating there. They were delicious! 

We had a four course meal paired with wines from the Languedoc region. Just for the record, Languedoc is a former province of France (and I have to admit that I have never set foot in there). The old region is now comprised by the regions of Languedoc-Roussillon and Midi-Pyrénées in the south of France. 

If you have never tried wines from the Languedoc region, I would recommend you to try. My favourite was the Crémant de Limoux, but yes, I am bias as I am a huge fan of Champagne and Cava. The sommelier did do a very good job!

Our meal was.... ok. I would love to give you the full menu (with the proper terminology) but I forgot to take a menu with me. The appetizer was a light salad with a beautiful cod and potato gratin with cheese on the top. We had a delicious escargot dish that was my favourite, and pork and fois gras wrapped in pork fat for our main course. The dessert was a creme brulee (too runny to my taste but nice in flavour).

The restaurant was nice as usual, the company was great, the wines were good and so were our food. It did not wow me at all but we had a good time. Would I come back to Biff's? Of course! I love their oysters and their nice atmosphere but I don't think I would go to another event.
