BSmqxPbQglQwP2R56OqOag Fabulous food! Every time we go there the food has been nothing short of perfection. My favorite is the chicken. Not sure how they get the skin crispy like that but it's magic in my mouth. 

They also bring a little tray of limes, oranges and lemons to add to your glass of water. NICE TOUCH!

The owner is also very knowledgeable about the wines.
