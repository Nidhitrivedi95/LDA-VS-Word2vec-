Everything was phenomenal. This meal was like living a scene from a movie. 

First, a complimentary limo picks you up from your hotel, and drives you to the MGM. You may think you are being dropped off at the Casino door where all the limos and taxis go, but no. Instead, you are taken to a special mansion-like entrance, where the doors automatically open for you and a person is already waiting for you. And you know they are waiting for YOU specifically when they address you by your name. And they continually add little details like this throughout the night to make you feel special.

You wait by the fountain, with the whole beautiful courtyard to yourself. It is a beautiful location, and a wonderful way to relax and start your evening. They then walk you to your table when it is ready.

Then, your dining experience begins. You pick your course, choose your items, and enjoy the culinary adventure. Trays of items are wheeled to your side, where you select items such as breads, cheases, or truffles throughout the meal. Each and every course was delicious. And the service is wonderful. Attentive and understanding. There to ensure you enjoy your night.

One of my favorite memories from Las Vegas.
