I had a crepe and my dessert was a warm chocolate souffle which was mentioned to me when our dinner orders were taken because it takes a long time to cook and they would put it in at that time if I wanted one.  So I know it was freshly baked just for me!  Wonderful coffee, wonderful views.  A must for a special night in Vegas!
