9mG2yOnHtxVPEM1p8FqycA I had a croissant sandwich with grilled chicken, avacado, brie and pesto. It looked like a small sandwich at first but it packs a punch! It was so rich and tasty I could hardly finish it. I'll never underestimate La Croissanterie again!

I also got a couple nutella-filled croissants to go. They smell like a chocolatey buttery heaven.
