This restaurant is great choice after watching the Cirque Du Soleil Beatles Love show. Amazing service from the moment you walk in. The teamwork from the staff at Le Cirque is what every restaurant needs for the perfect dining experience. 


I ordered the 3 course meal
Foie Gras: So delicious. It just melts in your mouth. Topped with quinoa and rice crisps 

Scallops: Simple but very flavorful. Can't go wrong with scallops!

Crème Brulé: The waiter said "if you don't like it, your meal is on me". I normally don't like sweets but Le Cirque continues to amaze me. Not overly sweet and great way to end the meal.
