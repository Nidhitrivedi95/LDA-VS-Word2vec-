Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA Went here partly for my birthday and to see some friends of a friend.  I wasn't sure what to expect since the line was very small....and people walking out said it wasn't worth it.  Instead of paying $30 each, we opted to pay for bottle service...costing $360 for entry, table, bottle of vodka, Red Bull, tax, and tip.  I have to agree with other folks that it can be pretty pricey here.

As soon as we arrived to the 64th floor, I noticed a small and cozy lounge with spectacular views....especially from our table!  The music was alright, dance floor was small, staff was friendly, and there was a lot of breathing room (that night).  Stogies were lit and we enjoyed our night!  Thanks guys!
