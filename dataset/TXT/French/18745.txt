AHosGBveeXx9YjsQvdJgeg This place has never disappointed me. Since I live in another town, I've only ever visited Bentley's during lunch, and each time, it's been amazing! We always make reservations and arrive early (even though there are plenty of tables available at lunchtime) because we want to get the table with the best view of the city. On our last visit, I ordered the Chef's special which was a lovely salmon, with grilled asparagus, mashed potatoes, and a delicious mushroom-bourbon gravy. I have never had salmon cooked any better, to the exact temperature that I'd ordered it.  And although I don't love asparagus, theirs had that freshness, but was still tender, with the hint of a char. Yum! I would eat that asparagus every day.  I attended lunch with two co-workers who were dining at Bentley's for the first time. Both loved their meals and the entire experience.  Service was on-point, the atmosphere was great, the food was delicious.  Ahhh!  I couldn't ask for more.
