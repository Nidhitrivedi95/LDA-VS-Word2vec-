1cGyzWtfOoDiE8V0OR85yA We went for brunch at around 11:30 on a Saturday morning. There's a large menu up on the wall. You order at a counter, they bring the food out to your table. We ordered a turkey-avocado-tomato-cheese panini to share, then a nutella banana crepe for me, and a nutella crepe with berries for my husband. We also ordered a french hot chocolate each. The girl at the counter offered to bring out the panini first and the crepes later if we wanted, and so that's what we did. We got our hot chocolate first. It was rich and thick, but a little too bitter for my taste. My husband really enjoyed it, though. We were then brought the panini, which came with a side salad and some sort of vinaigrette dressing. The bread was thick and crusty, cheese perfectly melted, good portions of meat, and perfectly grilled. Around 10 mins after we finished our panini, the waitress brought us our crepes . Each one was filled with so much warm and melty nutella! Yummmm! They also came topped with walnuts and whipped cream. The crepes were thinner than those I had eaten at chain breakfast places. They were so good, we both wiped our plates clean. There's so many varieties to still try!
The waitstaff was attentive and friendly, even though it was so crowded,  and there was a perpetual line at the counter from the time we came in to the time we left. We never felt rushed the entire time. As others have said, cash only, but there's an atm right next door.
