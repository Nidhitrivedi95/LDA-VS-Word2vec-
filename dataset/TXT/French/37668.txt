jalA5zHW8ZfY3RSPG7oDxQ As you walk into Cafe Du Jour, you feel like you're entering someone's kitchen. It's a warm and kind of homey feeling. Since it was summertime, we were seated outdoors. The atmosphere was relaxed but still good for a casual romantic date. A large extended family were seated behind us and some graduate students with their advisor to our right. 

My date and I started off with the Spinach & Asiago Dip which was not only superb but generously sized. The baguette itself was delicious. 

As for entrees, my date ended up getting the chicken and I got the salmon. My salmon entree was satisfying with its layers of flavors. 

All in all service was good. We left full and appreciative of the quaint little spot tucked away on Carson Street..
