The view: The view was spectacular- unfortunately, the servers were constantly interrupting the wonderful fountain shows to ask us to take pictures, or to move our plates.

The food: Good.  Forgettable.  The corn and bay scallop soup was decent.  The corn was off, but perhaps being from the midwest I just have a higher standard for corn- especially at $20 a bowl.  The escargot was bland, but not bad.  My wife's beef wellington was spot on, nearly as good as Ramsey Steak.  My rabbit was also bland, and the presentation made it hard to eat- I did eat it all, but I won't remember it next week.  The banana souffle was amazing, best part of the meal.

The service: Perhaps it was because we were one of the last tables of the night, but the servers were TOO attentive.  Always grabbing things off the table, moving our bread plates, trying to take pictures.  I am all for good customer service, but even for a high-end, high-service restaurant this was borderline intrusive.  Sometimes, less is more.
