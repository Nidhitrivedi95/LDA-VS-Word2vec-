4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Delicious parisian food and great atmosphere.  I've eaten here twice now, both on a beautiful evening.  The food is delicious, portions on the smaller side but there are buffets for gorging, and the view of the Bellagio fountains is wonderful.  Sometimes it can get cold if you're not directly under the heater lamps.  Otherwise would totally visit again!
