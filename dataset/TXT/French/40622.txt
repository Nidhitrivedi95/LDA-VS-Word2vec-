KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA Really love this place,  the atmosphere is unique. The food is miles above most restaurants in the area.  Friendly staff. All around great place to have a meal. I have one request for the chef. I humbly ask can you please put the pot roast sandwich back on the menu? Or maybe make it a special or something. I absolutely love that sandwich, nothing like it in all of Vegas. Or at least I haven't found and I've been looking. Many other great things on the menu, just miss that sandwich. I used to drive from rainbow and 215 at lunch to get that sandwich. I hope maybe the manager or owner might read this and bing back that tasty wine drenched oh so soft pot roast meat with the sautéed mushrooms. Oh my god my mouth watering just thinking of it! 
Thanks a loyal coustomer.
