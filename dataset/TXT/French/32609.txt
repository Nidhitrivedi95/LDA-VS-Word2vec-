gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg I give this place five stars just for the beer battered maxi fries. Nice selection of beers and I liked that they gave pairing recommendations for each menu item. We got their flatbreads -- I highly recommend the artisanal meat one. Overall, tasty and filling food, fair prices, and great service.
