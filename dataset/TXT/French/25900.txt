We only went up to visit the lounge. One big downside was the cover charge ($20 each!) that we weren't expecting but we just treated it as an entry fee as if going to a viewing deck ;)

The drinks were nice and the bar was starting to get a bit busier as we got there. But the main thing we went for (the view) was well worth it - especially at night looking right across the light beam coming from the pyramid below.
