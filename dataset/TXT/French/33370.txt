hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA What a find!

First let me say that the owner of this place is just delightful. He takes so much pride in his work and in his food that he is genuinely sad when you tell him you are taking the order "to go".

He really wants you to stay and enjoy yourself.

Great vegetarian/vegan options. I tried the Moroccan Sandwich (forget what the actual name was) - and it was amazing.

The coffee - well of course it was spectacular too. 

Great area for outdoor seating, and also a lovely cafe feel on the inside. Prices reasonable, and portions very fair. 

Will definitely return to try the rest of the menu, and will plan to hang out for a bit longer as the vibe and energy here was just wonderful.
