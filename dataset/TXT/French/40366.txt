This is possibly one of the most obscure dining destinations in Las Vegas , but well worth the trek off the strip and into suburbia.  Located on the banks of a man made lake in the West side of the Valley, and well hidden.  If you don't know where this is, you will never find it.  Best part is my mother, age 79, had this in her bag of tricks.

You enter into a wine store replete with rows of wine bins and, I must say, a fairly nice selection of wines and affordable prices.  

Now, the great part.  You exit the back of the store onto a large dining patio that is terraced to the water, fireplace, lakeside etc etc.   Very nice , beautiful and comfortable.    Our server, Kelly, a Los Angeles transplant, was knowledgeable and very informative.  We started with a Napa Silver Oak for $95 then on to Prisoner cab for $65.00, nice glasses and presentation with a serene view of the lake and sky.

The bad part :(.  Food is not worthy of the ambiance and wine selection.  We had the upgraded wine and cheese platter, which included two pate (one pork and one pork and chicken), a lobster salad (not good) Quince jam, apple slices, very fishy Salmon and some very fatty and warm salami.  We gave it another chance and ordered the escargot (flavorless) and the mussels.  Mussels were tender but not much flavor.
