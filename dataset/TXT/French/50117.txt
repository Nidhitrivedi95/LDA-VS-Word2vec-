OVrNItYaf-AWNGgeJA1Tsw Interesting little find tucked away in a friendly family neighbourhood. Reservations needed for inside dinning room while bar and patio is good for walk-ins. Glad that was the case as we stumbled upon a very busy restaurant in time for a sitting in a comfortable backyard patio. 

The food is pretty good. Presentation very good and the service was also very good.
