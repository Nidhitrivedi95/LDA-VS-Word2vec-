It's been around for a while, and definitely has that late '70s vibe that hasn't been updated, but that's part of the charm of feeling like you're in a restaurant that's no fuss, no trends, just good classic food. The warm goat cheese salad and the duck rillette were great appetizers. The bread was perfectly chewy and crunchy, and the classic Montreal spread with the jar of gherkins and mustard were surprisingly delicious. The quail entree was fantastic- juicy, crispy skin, chewy black rice, and a beautiful presentation. My family also enjoyed the ravioli and the steak frites. If you like French food, I'd recommend this restaurant for sure.
