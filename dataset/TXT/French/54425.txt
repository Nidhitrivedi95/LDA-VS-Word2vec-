rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw Had the buckwheat king crab crepe with apple slices and mushrooms, which was a great mix of flavors.  Followed it with the oak-smoked pork chop, which was a large portion and probably the best pork chop of my life.  It had savory, smoky flavor with just the right amount of fat, was cooked perfectly, and was complemented by the sweetness of carrots it was topped with.

Service was attentive and speedy.  Overall a top-notch meal... although the price tag matched. :-)  I wish I had room for dessert.
