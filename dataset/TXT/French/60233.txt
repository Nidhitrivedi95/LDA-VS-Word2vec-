SBnpT6JDbah-5l_52GM5sw The acoustics are horrible, unless you're in the bar area or patio.  The food is pretty decent- well thought out.  However, I don't eat pork, and there are very few dishes available porkless.  The Valentine's Day specials menu was fabulous- as there were Camembert Croquettes- really wonderful, on a bed of sauteed greens with (I believe- it was dark) cherries, grapes, walnuts and a mustard sauce.  Very good- I wish it were a regular on the menu.  I'd have a go to thing to order.  Otherwise, not much for me on the menu.  Nice wine list.
