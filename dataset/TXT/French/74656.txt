xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g This was my second time going, and I want to say overall, the experience was pretty good. 

I ordered the "queen" steak, but both the times I got it, it was pretty tender and cooked well to the degree I wanted it. My party had the lobster dish and it was pretty scrumptious. The portion was enormous. It surprised me actually. The other person in my party got the Dover sole at the recommendation of the server, and that was also amazing. 

We didn't really get a good seat to see the Bellagio fountains but I guess that is to be expected since we didn't make a reservation.

Didn't have the desserts this time, but when I had the soufflé and it was delicious. It's definitely worth a try... and the 40 minute wait. 

This place is a great place for visitors who want a fancy dinner and with a good view, but a reservation is probably recommended.
