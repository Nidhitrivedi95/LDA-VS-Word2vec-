28rRiCNsqRf95R6jj3ENcQ Before I put in my 2 cents in without considering that I was in fact, in another country, I will review about the food first.

-Crepe: I had the ratatouille with mushrooms, egg, and tomato paste. It is wrapped and presented in the most beautiful way. The taste was not so great, but this could have been a result of me eating it cold on my drive back down to NY so I will forgive and forget.

-Desserts: I cannot list all of the desserts I have tried here, because that would be an entirely long list. Just as delicious as they look, they ARE in fact, delicious. I am not a big fan of desserts that are too sweet, so I had to appreciate the lightness and subtlety of the fruit tarts. 

Perfect for bringing back gifts for family and friends.

Service is a hit or miss depending on the waitress. Bear in mind that they take orders, prepare the food, AND serve it. I initially wondered whether the mediocre service was because of cultural differences, but I just realize that it wasn't and that this place is just poppin' and busy as can be. 

No doubt about this though...people are nice and helpful in Montreal..a very nice change from the city life.
