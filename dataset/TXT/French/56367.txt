What they say is true about Bouchon and Thomas Keller.  It's amazing!

I read from other yelpers that dinner was not worth it, so instead, I took my friend for lunch/brunch for her birthday.  We both loved our food!  Even though 2 of our friend didn't get the food and taste that they were looking for, but I thought my Croque Madame was the best I've had!  Really reminded me of my visit in Paris.  The other really awesome dish was Chicken and Waffle.  I would totally go back for them again.  Portions were generous.

Our waitress was really friendly, and the decor is amazing because it's inside the beautiful venetian.  Overall, just a relaxing atmosphere for a Sunday to end our trip.
