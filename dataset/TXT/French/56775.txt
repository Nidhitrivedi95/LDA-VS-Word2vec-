rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Bouchon was the absolute perfect place for a classy Saturday brunch before getting down and dirty at the Lavo day club later on in the day.

They do not take ressies for brunch, but was told that if you arrive pre 11am, or post 1pm, you should not have an issue getting a table; just be seated before kitchen closes at 2pm and you are golden. Given my love for brunches waaaaay late in the day, obvi my group of 7 and I arrived a little after 1pm and only waited 5 mins for our table to be ready. 

The atmosphere is light and airy - reminding me a bit of Balthazaar in the city. The menu was extensive & everything sounded amazing, but I knew I HAD to get the chicken & waffles [$25] as well as the croque madame [$19]. A few of us started with some coffee which was rich and aromatic. 

They began by placing 2 "branches" of olive bread on our table. They legit looked like branches! Super cute - we all just grabbed a "leaf" and pulled. It was like having a wishbone moment at Thanksgiving, except we were all winners! ;)

The plates arrived soon after, and the portions were very very very generous. My friend and I split the C&W and CM and could not finish our meal at all. The CM comes with like 5lbs of french fries! I was pleased to read that the C&W was not fried but roasted, as I had given up fried food for Lent. The chicken on that dish was SOOO succulent, moist, and tasty. It came with gravy, but was juicy enough to eat on its' own. Each dish comes with a dark meat and a white meat piece - both of which were amazeballs. The waffles are infused with BACON(!!) and chives, and had the right amount of crisp in them. The CM was good, but nothing amazing. I did enjoy the slippery egg on top and the perfectly runny yolk.

The other girls ordered the Salmon Baguette [$16] (which you have to assemble yourself - cute, but I like my food done for me, thx), pot of mussels [$25.50] (lots and lots of lots and mussels!), and the sourdough waffles [$12] (the girl who ordered this is a waffles fiend, so she def liked it =D)

Such a great meal w/ my best girlfriends. Would definitely return if I'm ever back in Vegas (psh, if? More like when...)
