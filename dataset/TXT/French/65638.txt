U4e-0KtL2aPURQwbefjF3Q Hidden little restaurant in the "Yellow House" on Bay & Gerrard. I was not expecting this place to be this great! They have a large variety of delicious sandwiches and wraps, using what seems to be fresh ingredients every time. Don't let the low price lead you into underestimating the quantity either, because the sandwiches are huge! Always something new to choose each time, and I have yet to be disappointed.
