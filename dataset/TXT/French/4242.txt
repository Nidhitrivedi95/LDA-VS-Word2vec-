Technically, we arrived just after brunch service ended but there were plenty of menu options that worked for a brunch type meal so we were very happy.

Service is swift yet friendly. The decor is great; right out of Paris in the best possible way. I highly recommend making a reservation as they can get very business, especially on weekends.

The house made cornichons are a highlight of any meal here and be sure to peruse the wine menu for some great "biologique" options.

While it seems kind of "hypey" I'd say that L'Express is still a must try when visiting Montreal, I know I plan to make a visit every chance I get!
