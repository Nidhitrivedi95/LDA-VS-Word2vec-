fKDyiIcFLkl-_5d4JsvBXA With only one option being steak and fries this establishment is easy, simply and yet I enjoyed my meal quite thoroughly. If your only going to do one thing right do it well. The soup was delicious, the salad was average the steak was extremely tender and the dessert was rich and topped the meal off perfectly.

I highly recommend this place.
