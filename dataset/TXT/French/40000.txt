K67pkQljTFTW_P-7xUQrFw Can you believe L'académie has an astounding 9 locations in Montreal and the surrounding area? That blows my mind. I've only ever been to the one on Crescent so this was a first trying their St. Denis location.

Went with the fam jam as I would never have picked this myself. Honestly, I didn't even realize we had stepped foot into L'académie until it was too late. At least it's BYOB so grab a bottle of wine from the SAQ across the street and enjoy the nice breeze coming through the sliding windows.

Front part of the menu is starters and pasta. At least the pastas are cheap here ($12.95) from Sunday to Wednesday evenings and lunch time everyday. Gotta get people in somehow right?

There's also mussels & fries, poutines and chicken. Mussels and fries are on special for $13.95. Table d'hôte if you want a starter (soup or salad) and drink (tea or coffee). Back part is broken into veal, land, sea and desserts. Lastly, a separate dessert menu in case their massive portions weren't enough for you.

- Deinhard - my uncle grabbed this from the SAQ and it was really delicious. Light, crisp white wine that didn't break the bank. That's a win in my books.
- Buns - obviously, these are just filler but went well with dipping in the soup.
- Leek and potato soup - the potato and leek soup came with the table d'hôte. Not bad actually.

- Lasagna pasticciata ($12.95)
- Tortellini rose ($12.95)
- Provencal mussels and fries ($13.95)
- Linguini con gambrel ($16.00 table d'hôte)
- Veal scallopini with wild mushrooms ($16.00 table d'hôte)

Let's just say this was my only dud during my trip of amazing eats in town. I'd only come here if you want to take advantage of the BYOB but why would you do that when there's so many other BYOB's in town with amazing food?
