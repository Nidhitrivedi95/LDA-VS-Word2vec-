gxMa7j1LXIUxxBoP0osDpA Before going to Montreal for the weekend, my husband did some research for a place where we could bring our own wine. O'Thym was recommended by several people. 

We arrived about 45 minutes early and thought we might be able to be seated early. Little did we know "2 seatings per night" means one starts at 6 and one starts at 9. We had to come back. Which was fine because we had the chance to explore the "bohemian" neighborhood where O'Thym is located. 

Just before nine, most of the earlier customers had left and groups of people started pouring in for the second seating. The waitresses methodically opened bottles while describing the menu items. The small staff of 3 worked the room with precision and pleasantries. 

The food was new French with many of seasonal and local ingredients, but prepared with a freshness leaving some of the richness of traditional French food behind. 

I had zuchinni flowers stuffed with mushrooms served over a bed of sweet peppers drizzled with a red pepper sauce. My main course was bison steak and served with too many supporting dishes and flavors for my liking. (a small portion of potatos gratin was so cheesy that the cheese took over the flavor of anything else with it).

My husband had ceviche for his entree followed by a filet mignon which he found to be cooked perfectly, but a bit rich for his taste. His meal was served with the same host of side dishes. 

There was a nice surprise - a palate cleansing course of melon sorbet served in a martini glass splashed with vodka. MMM!

The place had a good energy. We would go again!
