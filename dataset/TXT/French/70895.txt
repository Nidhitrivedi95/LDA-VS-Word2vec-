xBxDMEkFK5GBhiy-8gGE9w Went here on the suggestion of my cousin that lives in Montreal.  Was unable to get a reservation online, but was able to secure a spot at the bar by stopping in at lunchtime to ask if there were any openings that evening.  Tip: there were many open tables in the restaurant that evening.  Don't rely on the Open Table saying that they're booked as I believe many people had multiple reservations and then make a game time decision.  I had seen the Anthony Bourdin clip where he tried the mushrooms with soft boiled egg, so I knew that I wanted to start my meal with this.  It was divine.  For my main course I chose to get the salmon tartare.  It was wonderful.  I opted for the salad instead of the fries, but wish that I hadn't.  The mixed greens were in very large pieces that made it difficult to eat with any sort of grace.  The dressing was also a bit bland given the bitter taste of the greens.  The fries that I spied on another diner's plate looked delicious.  My husband was less happy with his salmon that had been steamed and is served at room temperature, but the fennel that was served with it was fantastic.
