Everyone enjoyed their food and liked that we had the option of ordering from the regular menu or the set course that they were offering. We tried the fried asparagus, seafood chowder, cod, steak frites (love their skinny fries), and macarons from the Summerlicious. From the brunch menu, we got the burger (which was huge and delicious) and the pork banh mi benedict (which was good but felt like it needed more pickled vegetables and pate to make it taste more like a banh mi). Overall a great experience and we will be back.
