rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A The service at this restaurant is impeccable. From our wonderful server Julie ( asked to be seated in her area, she's very knowledgeable of the menu and the food preparation) to even the guy that brings the amazing bread! We had an amazing time, amazing food and drinks! We had the fried pig ears and the salmon rillettes as starters and I finished with the truffle pasta and the berry pavlova for dessert. A must, if you are a jack Daniels whiskey drinker, is to try the very unique bottle of the JD Sinatra edition whiskey, pricey at $40 a drink but insanely good!!
