Let me first say that our waitress was AMAZING.  I think her name was Cara.  She was extremely helpful, funny and genuine.  She was on top of refills and did not rush us out when it was clear we had finished our dinner.

Second, the food was quite good.  I had the ahi tuna salad.  The tuna was perfectly seared.  I loved the avocado and pineapple.  The only note I have on the dish was that I was given greens the size of a half head of lettuce!  It was just too much lettuce.  I felt wasteful.  I suppose some people can eat a huge salad, but I left most of the lettuce on the plate.  

I like the ambience here.  The noise level was appropriate.  We were seated near the bar and we were able to have a perfectly good conversation without trouble.  

A lot of the patrons seemed to be male, with many appearing to be discussing business or having just come from work.  I'd like to visit again at happy hour and see if the mix of people changes. 

I would make a drive from Ahwatukee to eat here again.  I guess that means I like it!  :)
