QeEQXdto_4wFRaNKyIygRA A friend and I stopped in here earlier this year during a festival uptown.

The place was packed but it was sort of between shifts so we were seated quickly.  Our server was great and very efficient.  

The food is typical bar/pub fare, nothing I would really consider to be associated with the real French Quarter but what we ordered was good food but nothing you couldn't find any any other neighborhood pub.  But the prices are very affordable here, even for the drinks are affordable and they don't try to be pretentious here like many other places uptown.
