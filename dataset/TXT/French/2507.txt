0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g We had dinner the day after Christmas, 2011.  It was a great meal.  Prix fixe menu of either 4 or 5 courses.  You do not have to order the same number of courses, which was a nice option to have.  My choices on this day were: quail salad; Kobe beef spears, Wagyu short ribs and panacotta for dessert.  They were wonderful choices.  The portions were generous.  Of the four courses, the Quail salad was my favorite.  Four hearty portions of quail pieces and some greens to accompany the dish...it is usually the other way around at other places.  Equally impressive were the Picasso paintings on the wall coupled with the Bellagio water show you can see outside.  But it is pricey.  With wine, it could set you back $150/person.  So win a lot of money at the gaming tables before you go.
