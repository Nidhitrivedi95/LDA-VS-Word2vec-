4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Incredibly friendly and professional wait staff. (Had a younger woman waittress around lunch time, wish I remembered her name!) She was so nice and helpful!
It was hard to even make a choice as far as menu options because everything sounded equally amazing.
Just wanted to give them the positive review they deserved. I had the french onion soup, open faced tuna sandwich, and an awesome chocolate mousse dessert. I will post pictures of all!
Thanks for a great lunch :)
