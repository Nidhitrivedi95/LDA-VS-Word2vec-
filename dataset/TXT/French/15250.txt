6FAi8I02ebfThz00QpTbkQ I really wish these guys these best but I have to keep it real and bump this down a star based on my last experience. I ordered the fish and pasta main and it was quite expensive and I found it fine, but not mind blowing or delicious. Not a big deal. When the owner asked how I was enjoying it I said it was fine and instead asking any follow up questions he was shocked not to receive pure praise and made fun of the use of the word fine. Just a small moment but a bummer and it came back to me when I walked by recently and asked myself why I had stopped frequenting the establishment. I think the last thing people want or deserve when they are spending their hard earned moolah is to feel mocked or like their tastes don't matter or their business is unappreciated. 

Anyway, everything i said before still stands I'm sure! Cute place that seems to be doing well and i wish them only good things.
