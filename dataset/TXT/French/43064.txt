LQ_gYNs5E10IGFE0NOyD7A The chef Chris and the manager Phil and our server Quinn were phenomenal. The atmosphere was so amazing! And the food and wine was divine!! For only being open for 4 months this place takes the cake. We are on our long weekend away celebrating our 15 year anniversary from Reno NV. And this place would fit right in to our amazing Midtown area. Thank you!   Mark & Jen Gardella.
