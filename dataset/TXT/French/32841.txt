H2mDO9cvF-WLvyZexCyvZw This is the original Andre's restaurant not the one in the Monte Carlo.  Andre himself prefers this location.  The decor is very simple and as another reviewer accurately describes as "country french".

Our server was excellent and the sommelier was very helpful selecting our wine.

The food while very good was not good enough given the price range of the restaurant to give it 5 stars.
