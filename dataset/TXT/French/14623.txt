5fquJHY2hMX9tPRD5s0t5g I would eat here once a week, maybe twice if I lived in Charlotte! Everything was delicious and the service was fantastic.  I had a mixed greens salad to start, gnocchi with duck sugo and a side of creamed turnip greens. Can't remember what my husband had but he loved it all as well.  We were way to full but we shared dessert anyway because everything was so good.  So glad we did.  The coconut cake was amazing with creme anglaise and  chantilly cream!!
