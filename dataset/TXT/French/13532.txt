4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw This is a very, very tardy review of one server only.  She is Server No. 44 (that's the tag she wears), and her name is Tammy. 

 If you read my review from September 2011, you already know I'm as huge Tammy fan for her awesome service.  Fast forward to May 2012 and we're having brunch at Mon Ami Gabi.  A nice fellow is waiting on us....and I have to pause to say that every server we've been in contact with here has been super professional and on top of it...just first class.  Anywhoozle, we start in on this guy about ordering our London broil benedicts.  He goes back to the kitchen and asks if they can make this, and as the story goes, Tammy over hears him.  She says to him, "Is it a couple...did they order bellinis?"  Next thing we know, here come Tammy to our table with a super nice little surprise for my wife!  She remembered us from before and just came to say hello.....are you kidding me!!!!  She remembered what we ordered, where we sat, and that the other customers ordered the same brunch after seeing ours.  Ha!  Fantastic!!

Tammy, you are awesome......and we will ask for you when we're there for brunch in February.  Don't bother bring menus, you know what we're having!  :)
