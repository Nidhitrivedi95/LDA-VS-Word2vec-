Yp9w4nhUowBU_IS_StFXbQ Three words: BEST FRENCH TOAST! Okay, maybe one more word: EVER!!!! Seriously the best French toast I've ever eaten, and worth all twenty dollars! My mouth salivates as I write this review because it's that divine! I would return to Vegas JUST for those heavenly pieces of French bread with bits of orange baked inside, submerged in a delightful white chocolate batter then grilled perfectly to a nice golden brown. DEEEEEEELICIOUS!
