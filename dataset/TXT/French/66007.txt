The restaurant was originally a jewelry shop back in the early to mid 1900's and while they have revamped the interior into a modern vibe it still holds some of the old school style and flair. They have 4 tables that are actually inside what used to be the vault room.

The servers are incredibly kind and knowledgable about the menu, the city, and willing to engage in colorful conversations (should your dinner guests not be entertaining enough).

Their Vegan offerings, in particular, are top notch. The Tournedos of Seitan is the second best Vegan dish in Cleveland but only because the Stuffed Cabbage they make here is clearly #1.

Perfect place to dine before checking out a performance in Playhouse Square or celebrating a rare Browns victory in style.

There are two outdoor lots that have parking for $5 within 2 blocks and several parking garages $10-15 within a 7 minute walk and valet is available!
