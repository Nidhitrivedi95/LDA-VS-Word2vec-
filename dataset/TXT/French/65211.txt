u-SvRRAfYgpbXZRfQgcTzA I went here once last year with a group of 15 people (friends @ work) and we really go a great service and good food. 

I came back this year for my bday, mid-september. We were four and loved it too.

First time I came here there was a lot of noise. (Thursday) There is this environment where the waiters yell to each other (in some asian I guess It's japanese). Of course you have to add-on the Shots : the famous Sake-Bomb so if there are quite a lot in a row that are ordered, it gets pretty pretty noisy and it's hard to have a conversation. 
If you do not go as a group, you might be sitting next to strangers, like in Asia ! 
This year we went on a Monday : it was much better for the noise level ! 

The food is really tasty and yummy. We love their sizzling beef, the really tasty pork belly skewers, the fried chicken, etc. With a good bottle of SAKE !! 

We always had good service even when we were the group of 15.

This is good restaurant for groups and for sharing food !!
