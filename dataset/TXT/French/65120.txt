tpOStoyngCFJYGtyvxOPmA Disappointing tonkinese soup:   3 slices of overcooked beef, sprinkles of green leaves, 3-4 forksful of noodles and a bowlful of broth made out of powdered beef stock.  After eating the noodles, there was still a full bowl of broth left and was still hungry.   The tonkinese soup didn't in the least look and taste the said famous soup. 

 After reporting my disappointment, I was offered a free of charge tonkinese soup but still it didn't meet my expectations.  There were more noodles but the both was lukewarm.  I think they took back my broth n just added the noodles n a few slices of beef n gave me back.  In the end I did not eat the soup they brought me.

No stars for this place.
