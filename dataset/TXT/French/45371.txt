mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q Typically when I head to a fancy french place in vegas, I have to throw on my one of my nearly-never-used fancy outfits just to sit down. L'Atelier has the same fantastic food, without the snooty "up-scale dining" crap. And the prices are very reasonable.

Because we are foie gras deprived in California, we ordered all 4 foie items on the menu. The unanimous favorite at the table was Le Burger, an incredibly juicy beef slider toped with foie gras and caramelized peppers.

If this place was in my neighborhood, I would certainly frequent it!
