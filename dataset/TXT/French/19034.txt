ANHCo9X7zu0LdYecc9fk3Q Avoid this place. I ordered soup and rice. After 15 minutes of no food I went to ask where my food was. They said they were out of soup. When I asked if they were ever going to tell me another guy said what do I want. I said my food and he proceeded to drain the soup dregs into a cup. It only got worse from there. (This is the short version) Finally the manager stepped in to give me a refund, never apologized once, but only gave me the cash for my soup. I then had to point out that they never gave me any food at all! Finally when I went to their corporate website, this location isn't even listed. Which makes me think that mismanagement must be company wide.
