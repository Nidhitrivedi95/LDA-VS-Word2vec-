XZ7eQLjyGXf6y69UT4SGhg I visited the place for the first time today and I am delighted! I tried the croissant, the almond croissant and the chocolate brioche (I believe that was the right name). Everything was amazingly delicious! The service was great as well. There are limited pastries options but they are fresh and yummy!
