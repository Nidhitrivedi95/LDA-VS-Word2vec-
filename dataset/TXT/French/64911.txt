TI8BCPSStuOgnqBHyTtG9Q one of our favorite hotels in the whole entire world.  great location, especially if you're there for the fringe festival, and room size and furnishings were closer to a westin standard.  as usual of all starwood hotels, the beds were heavenly.  the hotel designer must've had fun with the bathrooms, which are set off with smoked glass...bath tub, separate shower, mood lighting (purple, red, green, plain).  i won't tell you which color we chose.

the bar has a variety of scotch which was fun to sit ourselves down for a tasting after a long sightseeing day.  we ate at the bar a couple times and the food was really good - we missed american classics like a solid club sandwich and caesar salad.

we went last spring and the hotel is still on our mind.  i think they just went through some major remodeling so can't wait to see how it looks this summer when we return.
