ZuYsZvJ5r32Fs70vPXbRgw I visited here for a friend's kid's 1 year birthday party. Out of prefix menu choices, I had the calamari salad, red wine reduction steak and crème brûlée. Firstly, I'm not sure what the issue was but the service was very slow, although the servers themselves were friendly enough. Calamari salad was decent but the steak was quite terrible. It had this fishy taste to it, as if either the steak was sitting in some sort of fishy liquid or as if they put in some fish sauce. It had a very pungent fragrance and fishy flavour. I'm not sure if this is on their regular menu but if it is, then I highly recommend that you DON'T get it.
My crème brûlée was pretty good but for others who had the same thing at my table, it came out too watery. 
I don't think I'll be going back.
