vKlfioFE5L-ZSUIbg0NY3Q This place is fabulous.  I was taken here for my birthday last February, and everything about it was 5-star quality.  The atmosphere is cozy and intimate - there was a guy playing acoustic guitar quietly which was a nice touch.  

We started with a bottle of Reisling which arrive chilled and in a bucket on ice... then tried the goat cheese appetizer witih mangoes... YUM.  I had stuffed peppers for my entree and they were amazing... tons of veggies, rice, and slivered almonds ensconced in yellow peppers, topped with melted parmesan.  

Finally, the waitress brought me a creme brulee for dessert with a candle in it - on the house!  I hate drawing attention at restaurants, but free dessert?  I'll take it!  

Also, very reasonable prices for top-quality French cuisine... I'd be back if I were still in Madison for sure.
