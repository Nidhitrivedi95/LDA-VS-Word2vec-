zw4Legbcu018p5WcZ74iWA The restaurant is small but good. All the staff were very friendly and price was reasonable. I just ordered one classic poutine to go. The food was made freshly and gravy was hot enough to melt the cheese curd. However, it seemed to be a little salty for me. Maybe it was not my dish. I preferred some kind of creative-style poutine~ I found that many customers chosen their burger. It looks good too.
