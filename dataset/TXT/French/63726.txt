T4g4k2OhCTsiqcP-ZXElHQ Good restaurant for a week night  or casual friday. Atmosphere is very warming and the waitress was very knowledable. Usually busy but not overly which helps make the place more warming of a dinner

The food is 3.5 starts and great but not great however its comparables in the walking distance area ie. Marben, le select bistro are more expensive mind you and maybe I have simply develop a flavour. Order the special shrimp and scallops which were both well done, well cooked and had that green onion taste common slightly north on spadina which was nice to add to the food given the location of the restaurant on the south end of spadina. Great job! The veal bone in was also delicious and I recommend. The frenh fries are mcdonalds fries and I wish they were different for somethin in this area or at least a different option. All in all good though.

My only downer here was the wine menu which jumps in price  drastically between bottles and of course the cheapest two (tables choice not mine) were sold out so you were stuck jumping up. Other than that great all arouns meal and restaurant.

Recommend: group's of 4 to 6 casual dinner and drinks. Jeans and a dress shirt or nice shirt. Youll be in good hands
