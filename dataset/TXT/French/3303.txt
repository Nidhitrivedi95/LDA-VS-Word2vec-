1cGyzWtfOoDiE8V0OR85yA I would give them four stars for their savory crepes (which are amazing - so if you're reading yelp to get lunch instead of sweets, do go!), but they only get a meh three because of their sweet crepes. I also might have given them more stars if their name didn't involve Paris, but since they're trying to say they are Parisian Crepes, they just don't get that fourth star. 

The crepes in Paris were light and fine and warm and just sweet enough and simply perfect. The butter and sugar crepe here lacked in the following ways: 1) granulated sugar instead of powdered sugar, 2) folded into an untransportable square, 3) dripping in butter, 4) practically fried in butter so the sugar caramelized. Again, it was tasty indeed. But if you are expecting to get Parisian style and quality crepes, this is not the place :(
