cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg Oh My Goodness!!!!  I have tasted heaven.  My wife and I spent a few days in Montreal recently.  Whenever we go anywhere, we dine at all the best recommendations made to us by the concierge.  Every restaurant we ate at was fantastic.  Europea, l'Epicier, Milo's, etc... but Au Pied de Cochon is in a league of it's own.  This is some of the best food I've ever had... anywwhere... Miami, NY, Paris, Tokyo... anywhere. Their specialty is Foie Gras.  I like foie gras, but with other options on the menu, I usually go for something else.  However, this is not your ordinary Foie Gras.  We had the Foie Gras Poutine, which included potatos, gravy and cheese.  Wonderful... but nothing comparted to the one the server recommended to us, which was a spectacular blend of Foie Gras with canadian bacon, sour cream and cheese on a pancake, topped with maple syrup.  Holy Jesus!!!!!  When you put that in your mouth, prepare to be blown away.  What a combination of flavors.  

I didn't think anything could beat that, and maybe it didn't, but the rest of the food was also amazing.  And finally, the dessert.  Wow.  I'm not a big pastry dessert guy.  These people know how to make a pastry.  We had an upside down creme brulee tart with berries.  That was simply one of the best, if not, the best dessert I've ever had.  To top it off, the bill was very reasonable.  It was actually the least expensive restaurant we tried during our entire stay in Montreal.  5 stars.  I'd give it 6 if I could.
