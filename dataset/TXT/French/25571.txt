Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA Maybe I'm not cultured enough to enjoy this place but I was soooo annoyed this night.  I think with all the gambling losses, the walking around aimlessly trying to find this place just pissed me off and the fact that they were going to charge me if I didnt show.  I spent about 30 minutes walking aimlessly asking mandalay bay workers where this place was and NOBODY KNEW.  The elevator up there was pretty cool and the place itself looked beautiful.  Also some of the best service I've ever had, very attentive.  But very pricey and what I had was just ok.  We had the tuna tartare (must have), fish and pork belly.  The main dishes were just ehhhh...  THe caramel sundae I had for dessert was pretty delicious.  Again, very pricey and I'd rather blow it gambling.  =)
