Fantastic patio spot for lunch that's mostly local young professionals.  Great wines by the glass.  I had an amazing duck confit sandwich with thinly sliced celery and apple on sliced bread that I believe had chestnuts in it.  Really unique and delicious.  

Did I mention the duck fat french fries?
