aervNtqzrKf0CGrFo4xfKw Great cozy atmosphere.  This is one of our go-to date night venues.  In the winter they sometimes have cheese fondue (my fave).  My go to main is the steak au poivre which is to die for. It is all I can do to not lick the plate.  And a must have is the pouding chomeur.  My mother-in-law always makes me order one to go for her as compensation for babysitting.
