Unable to resist the allure of a three-foot-long Baba Au Rhum, no matter how full from a several course feast at Veranda, it was up the exterior facing glass elevator that myself and two friends ascended to Alain Ducasse's soon to reboot MiX and meeting two more at a ten-top table in the center of a cascade of glass bubbles it was in conversation and desserts that we partook, another double espresso over ice at half the price of the Four Seasons Lavazza proving a perfect accompaniment to the four-plate proceedings.

Truly one of the most stunning rooms in Las Vegas, with nearly panoramic reviews of the Strip and beyond, it was entry that we saw the object of our desire and admittedly having experienced the dessert several times in the past in locations from New York to London the tableside preparation was slightly less dramatic than that at the others while the choice of rum was a well-culled trio, myself opting for the lightest option while others veered spicy - all with stellar results over the apricot glazed cake with plenty of cream.

Deciding to also invest in a shared soufflé that proved an impeccable display of rich dark chocolate amidst an ethereal base that found much needed levity in a quenelle of pistachio ice cream, it was next in six sliced balls of crispy pate a choux surrounding smooth vanilla that we indulged and topping each one with thick chocolate fudge the third Ducasse classic was perhaps the best version of the dessert I've tasted to date - a compliment of questionably equal applicability to the hot-from-the-pan Madeline, a lightly crisp edge over delicate sponge that was delicious on its own and all the better when dipped in a sidecar of warm hazelnut spread.

Advertising, to some degree, that the whole three-foot baba would be served at a cost of $12 one rationally assumed that deal was too good to be true, and instead charging $12 per person for what would amount to perhaps a two inch slice the portion was still quite generous considering the version in London goes for about $26 per person - though with far more pomp and circumstance.  Truly a beautiful space it will be interesting to see where the Delano takes Ducasse and "Rivea," but as long as they keep the signatures there is no doubt it is a space worth visiting, even if only for dessert with a view.
