WOd8tWsh2Yt_osHv-ngx_w Oh man, this place was great.

Talk about a filling breakfast! I was not expecting the amount of food I received, and everything was delicious. The place was packed to the gills, but we only had to wait 5 or so minutes to get a table on a Saturday morning.

I couldn't recommend this place more highly.
