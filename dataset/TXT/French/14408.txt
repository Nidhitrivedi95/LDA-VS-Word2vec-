5BAdubSKMARs3qYRHGaClA I love a good terrasse and since my boyfriend and I had coupons for free drinks we thought we'd give it a try.   It comes with great views of Old Montreal.  The terrasse alone makes this place worth visiting.

The clear sangria is definitely a must try when visiting here.  They garnish it with grapes and litchees and it's quite strong.  They also have a small food menu so if you're hungry you can grab a bite.  I went for the ribs and they were tender with a strong meat flavour in that the sauce wasn't overpowering everything.  The coleslaw that they came with was a little boring but that was the only part that kind of disappointed.  The fries were crispy and salty.

The prices are a little high for alcohol but the cocktails are fairly strong and I guess it is Old Montreal so that is to be expected.  The service was also quite good.  It was quick and our server was very friendly and helpful.
