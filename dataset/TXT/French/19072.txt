ANHCo9X7zu0LdYecc9fk3Q Next to American gate 19. Cafe Madeline chicken, mushroom and broccoli bow tie pasta with a light cream sauce made to order with a fresh hot bread stick for $11.50. Tasty and a good value. Nice manager offered me a free drink because they were out of the chicken breast with rice and broccoli that I wanted.
