R3uWM4Yyrlz3eifRX4IErw recently dinned here for the first time earlier this month and enjoyed everything from the delicious vegetarian pasta the chef created, to the cozy, romantic candlelit ambiance.
Aioli is a little hidden treasure in the east end, I cannot wait to return.
I especially loved the fresh, warm bread with the olive? dip.  I don't even like olives but I really loved that dip!
the staff, including the chef, are very friendly and courteous.  The restaurant is clean and quaint.
you would never guess such a lovely place existed on the Kingston strip.
