jLxeBgWhLRbII2ACkgH1Sg Ask for the Wi fi code!! It was eatmorebread in Oct 2014. Also, read about what they do to their water for purification. Please open one closer to McCarran (don't really because I would eat there everyday)!!

Food: Almond croissant and plain croissant for sharing. The almond croissant was flaky, light and had almond flavoring throughout the entire croissant. One of the best we have had! The plain croissant had a light buttery flavor and was so airy and delicious I didn't want it to end.

Poulet quiche and side salad and the breakfast sandwich also with the side salad. The quiche had great flavor and the hint of goats cheese was a nice touch. The crust was perfect and flaky and the quiche was light so you didn't feel weighed down. Husband enjoyed the breakfast sandwich and the bread was so fresh it was hard not to go back for more. 

The coffee was fine and had a unique taste (maybe their in home water purification). Be sure to glance one more time at the goodies in the window and fresh breads behind the counter before leaving as you may want to continue to enjoy the LBT experience at home. We WILL be back to visit.
