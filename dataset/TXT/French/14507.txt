5EIuCcoHY2evAhFMBV6G6g I arranged and attended a corporate dinner here for 20 or so people. I worked with Victoria and was very pleased. Also the staff, Kathy and our servers were all excellent. 

Some things I particularly liked about this place:
1. The menu options were good. We offered a salad, soup or mussels, scallops, pork cheeks or Ribeye and dessert. They prepared a special soup at our request and it was a great option. everyone in our party really enjoyed the food. we offered several desserts but people were pretty full after the dinner. 

2. Ambience was great in the private room and we even had a private reception area which made our party even better. On the "needs improvement" side, I wasn't crazy about the entry or the interior of the rest of the restaurant. Our guests didn't really see this so it had no bearing on our event. 

3. They were also very accommodating to late comers and folks who left early. Someone asked for something off the menu and they were accommodated with no fuss. 

4. We had nice assistance with the wine selection and were able to take away the unfinished and even a few extra to help meet our minimum as our crowd was on a non-drinking kick. 

I would recommend hosting an event with Pinot Brasserie for the skilled staff and nice presentation. If they are full or you need another location check out Postrio. They have a few private rooms that are very pretty.
