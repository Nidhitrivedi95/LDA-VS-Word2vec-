sAOgSr6suAE4axjIFSbtLQ I visited the Wine Cellar last week while waiting on a friend. I give this location three stars because the wine I ordered from the menu of wine by the glass is no longer offered by the glass. The bartender did have a recommendation for me to try that would be just as bold as what I initially chose. I was very happy with the recommended selection and will return here again if I am in the neighborhood.

PS--I love the walls! They are super fun and the texture gives a great dimension.
