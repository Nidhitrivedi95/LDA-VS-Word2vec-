L6RxkP8dneVGelDLUhjCug Great Vietnamese Cafe/Bakery Fusion place on Spring Mountain!

Based on my 2/26/16 - Friday visit. The Banh Mi was delicious and fresh. I was taken by surprise because it wasn't the traditional baguette that you come across in most Vietnamese cafes. The bread was light and fluffy in the inside and right amount of crispy texture on the outside. The almond croissant was very tasty and consistent throughout and it wasn't dry. Iced coffee was great since the sever informed me if I wanted it to be stronger or sweeter in taste and he was able to accommodate my preference in a stronger taste.

Overall the customer service was great with no issues and I will be coming back for more.
