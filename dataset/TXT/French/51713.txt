PlYrlj86zAYljZTRCBSZ3A Wow can't believe so little people have reviewed this place. My favorite poutine in the city. Made after you place your order. I've found Smoke's can taste a little stale as if the fries have been sitting around awhile. They are a great price and huge portions.

Selling out of a little shipping container wouldn't expect such tasty food. I love this place.
