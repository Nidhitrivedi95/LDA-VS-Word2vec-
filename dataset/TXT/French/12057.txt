4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Mon Ami Gabi used to be my go-to place for brunch before we depart Vegas. What's not to love? Awesome view, delicious food, affordable prices. Not many of these on the strip.

I love the the crepes--small but savory. The french onion soup is an eruption of gruyere cheese goodness. The steak frites are bizarrely addictive. If steaks are your preference, there's a vast selection here, but it's hit-or-miss. My recommendations are the bone-in ribeye (at 22oz, it's for serious eaters only!) or the filet mignon.

Most people fight for the patio seats, but I actually like the pavilion because it's shaded and slightly cooler. Vegas can scorch when you're under the sun! Neither area can be reserved via Open Table.

Unfortunately, my most recent visit was disappointing. The portions are noticeably smaller and the quality is slightly off. Still decent, just not as overwhelmingly perfect as before. However, Mon Ami Gabi will always hold a special place in my tummy.
