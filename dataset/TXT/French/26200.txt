d482l58ho0_IMdFkXX1F5Q In few words: the food is 4 stars, service is 2 stars. 
I was staying at the Venetian with my parents and we saw an extremely flattering and convincing commercial for this restaurant in our hotel room. We decided to dine here for dinner and I was extremely excited to have a paycheck's worth of an entree lol
Anywho, my father has a thick Spanish accent and the waitress had some difficulty understanding him. My dad has no shame in asking questions and the waitress would lean in and answer dramatically slowly, which I found to be rude and belittling. I usually step in and help translate or formulate the words my dad is trying to conceive, but they were both getting passively aggressive in their tone. My dad agreed that she was a bit hostile in explaining the different types of sauces that go with his $60 steak. 
A steak that he admits was one if the best he's ever had. My mom also enjoyed her prawn linguini, and I had a blast devouring my roasted chicken. My roasted chicken was a bit dry, but the bed of roasted vegetables added juices and jsatisfied my taste buds.
