hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA This place is nice. It's hidden in a Business Plaza. The place looks authentic in all senses and the food was good. The cappuccino is illy and very very good. The food was also up to par. 

So why 3 stars? 

The service was horrible. 

I waited ten minutes in front of the register to order my food and it was my turn. 

It took them for ever to bring my food. And they brought my food and my wife's drink. Making her wait and have her drink cool down. 

They were horribly understaffed. 

If they fix this it will be a five star place. 

Would not recommend this place to my friends currently.


Update :

So it's mlk day and I'm guessing the owner didn't expect to be so busy. He was kind enough to bring a dessert for free and apologized sincerely for the way our morning went. We never complained about it so he was aware of it. 

So I have given it a 5 star. The food and drink was amazing after all.
