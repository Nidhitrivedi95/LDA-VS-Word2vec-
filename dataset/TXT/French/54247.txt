We were excited to try their king crab crepe and $25 bottomless rose deal, but we arrived at the restaurant to be told the exhaust hood over their stoves wasn't working, and they were cancelling all remaining reservations. The manager walked us over to Herringbone (also in Aria), explained the sitch to their manager, who said they would seat us and honor the rose special...nice touch! We enjoyed a fresh squeezed greyhound at the bar, before being seated in their outside patio, where we had a fabulous lunch. When the check came, our server told us that Bardot had covered our rose tab....WOW! Having to shut down dining on a Saturday afternoon is a restaurant's worst nightmare, but they still went the extra mile to make it up to their inconvenienced customers...definitely will go back next time I'm in Vegas! And Herringbone was awesome too!
