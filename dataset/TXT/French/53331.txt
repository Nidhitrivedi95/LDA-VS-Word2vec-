QEgfK_TKY8bwK-YzKDdkGw So we came here for a friends birthday. I would like to think of myself as a foodie but the truth is my tastes just don't quite reach that level of out of the box eating (for an American). I will say this is a great restaurant though. I was not overly fond of the menu, but the food I ate was really good. I started out with an endive salad that had a cave aged thomme dressing on it and had prosciutto, candied walnuts, etc. I liked it a lot. Then I had the Texas Wild boar Chops which came with lobster mac and cheese and pork belly topped with roasted pear. I'm not a big lobster person but overall the mac and cheese was really good. The chops were cooked to my specifications and were tender and the pork belly was a nice touch as well. They brought us out a starter of lobster bisque and a cheese biscuit in the cutest teeny tiny mugs. They also brought out a brioche bun. The food is pretty classy I have to say and the glass of wine I had was nothing short of perfection. So if you are into French food and foi gras, and sweet breads and that kind of thing definitely check them out. I probably won't be back just because it's not my thing, but my friend said it's his favorite restaurant that he's tried recently. Oh side note it's pricey but I think anyone reading this probably knows to expect that and the service and staff here are absolutely some of the best I have experienced. No snobby people here!!
