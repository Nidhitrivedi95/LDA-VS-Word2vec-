gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA My husband and I dined at Alize to celebrate our anniversary.  I called to request a window table and they said there were no guarantees, but if we came early we would have a better chance.  We did get there early and taken to a table where one seat faced a wall.  When we asked for a better table, they put us in the middle next to a couple with their poorly dressed and obnoxious kid (not the restaurant's fault that parents don't know how to handle their kids).  At that point I did not care so much about the window, I wanted away from that kid.  A window table came available and when we asked, we were kindly (and understandably) moved.  We ordered the tasting menu which was delicious top to bottom.  We added the caviar starter which was great too.  A couple of cocktails and glasses of wine and the evening was turning out lovely.  Service was OK (I had to tell them to slow down, we were not in a hurry) until the ultimate disappointment at the end.  I had called a couple of days before to order (and pay for) a $65 4" cake.  I spoke to the manager the day before to make sure the cake was going  to be served as it was a surprise for my husband.  Well, dinner was over and the bill came, no cake.  I got up to remind them and the server said "Oh yea, I saw that back there".  She brought it out and asked "is this the one?"  It too was quite good, but I would expect a restaurant like that to handle such a request (and purchase) a bit differently.  So in the end, the food was good, but don't assume you will get top notch service.
