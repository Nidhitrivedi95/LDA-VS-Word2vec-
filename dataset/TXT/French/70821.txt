xBxDMEkFK5GBhiy-8gGE9w We went there the other night and had a great time.  We got a solitary table by the glass but still inside which is the way to go around sunset.  We could see people needing to adjust outside in the sun.

We started off with a glass of the viognier bubbly which was crisp and refreshing.  For dinner we had a nice sicilian red which wasnt too heavy.

We kicked it off with the fried cheese which was a nice small plate go start.  Very salty but yummy.  Vicki got the goat cheese gratin with beet sauce.  She liked it but thought it had a bit too much goat cheese.  I had the lamb carpaccio with a mayo drizzle and grilled veggies in the middle.  The lamb was actually cooked but was very good nonetheless.

But the best part was the main.  I had the flank steak.  Not too big a piece of meat and perfectly cooked at medium.  But the absolute highlight were the fries.  These may have been the best frites we've ever had.  Crisp, tasty and well sized we would go back just to get s side of these...and we just might.  Vicki was very happy with the merguez which had citrus roasted peppers and onions that were quite unique and delicious.

Our waiter was attentive and made good recommendations.  It should be in a montreal rotation without question
