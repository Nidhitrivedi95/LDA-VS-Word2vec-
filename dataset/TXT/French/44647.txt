mnn--vaYHtNyBNYFYBFIog Service was impeccable, food was delicious. The pace of the meal was slow and steady which gave us ample time to discuss the dishes and the experience. This was a great date night; we felt special from the second we walked in the door. Definitely go here if you can swing it, you won't regret it!
