rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Visited on a Saturday morning with a group of 4 to order breakfast before our drive back to California. 

We were seated within 15 mins or so in the outside patio, which was very nice. It was the perfect temperature with a beautiful breeze blowing.

Ordered an ice tea, which had great flavor (I know, what makes a great ice tea??) and dug right into the bread. As instructed, we added butter and jam, which is super delicious! 

We also ordered Beignets du Jour, which conveniently came with more jam and Nutella. These were yummy!

Now that we were sufficiently stuffed with bread, I made my order of  Oeufs Benedict; two eggs poached served with smoked salmon, country bread, sauce Hollandaise and mixed greens.

The food came out in just the right amount of time. Smoked salmon was delicious - great smoky flavor which mixed well with the eggs/bread. I wasn't a huge fan of the Hollandaise sauce, it seemed a bit bland (maybe the smoked salmon overpowered it). 

Our server was ok, not very personable. Didn't say much the entire time but delivered everything, so not a big deal. Sometimes you get a server that goes over the top and chats you up/shows enthusiasm. 

Wonderful experience I will definitely revisit again when back in Vegas!
