FRuuIDOd21pTJHvEGIt1Gg Came here on a Friday for lunch while on a business trip to Montreal. Given that it's in the financial district (Old Montreal), the crowd felt appropriately corporate. The ambiance was lively and the service was prompt and accurate.

I had the Beef Cheek, which was excellent. It was served on a bed of mashed potatoes and haricots. The sauce was a bit too savory, but didn't overpower the meat, which was so tender that I didn't even need to use my knife. Overall, my palate was pleased.

This is a good venue for business meetings and casual meals, but wouldn't be my first pick for a romantic night out.
