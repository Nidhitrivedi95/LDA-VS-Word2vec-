jalA5zHW8ZfY3RSPG7oDxQ I rarely walk away from a restaurant and feel the sense of overwhelming satisfaction with the entire experience that Cafe Du Jour provided.

The service was excellent, and the food was absolutely amazing. It's such a small, unassuming place, but the flavors coming out of the tiny open kitchen are top-notch. 

Combine the great, cozy atmosphere, beautiful patio (although it wasn't open when we were there), phenomenal food and service, and a chef that thanks you as you walk out the door past the open kitchen, and you're looking a perfect dining experience. I can't wait to go back!
