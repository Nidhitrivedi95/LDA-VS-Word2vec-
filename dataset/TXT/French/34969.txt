HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw So where to begin.......My wife and I arrived for dinner at 8:15 on a Wednesday night.  The place wasn't that crowded at that time.  Our very nice and pleasant waitress took our orders around 8:30.  So by 9:00 I began to think it was taking a little long for our food, but I was ok.  By 9:15 I thought maybe by" fresh" that my mussels were literally being fished at that moment. Our food didn't arrive until 9:40.  When it did finally come, the mussels were about as dry as can possibly be and my wife's pasta was average at best.  Seeing the disgust in my face, the waitress brought over the manager.  The manager needs to work on his customer relation skills.  When I said that the mussels were dry he looked at them then asked me "so they're dry you say?"  He just repeated back everything I said to him.  In a city with so many dining options to choose from, I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.
