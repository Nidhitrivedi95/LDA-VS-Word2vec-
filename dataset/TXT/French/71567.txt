XcWlBj5oQgzKhR7Cxovj3w As any frequent flier, I keep my expectations for airport food at a reasonable level. I am perfectly set with a protein bar, very happy with a Five Guys burger, and thrilled with Rick Bayless's place (thanks O'Hara!). All that said, I was shocked at the food quality at ZINC in the Phoenix airport. I had the pork belly appetizer and it was on par with Michelin star restaurants - perfectly braised, perfectly fatty, perfectly meaty with an unexpectedly delicious fig mostarda and a side of arugula for a sharp finish to a perfect bite. If this is the new way airport food is going, bring it on!
