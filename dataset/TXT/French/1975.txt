0KbcIOCoDrIaBPx9hfoXcQ Years ago, this place used to be a Scandinavian café that I loved. Then it closed and I was so sore at Beaufort.Turns out, they have kept some Nordic dishes (meatballs, gravlax, smorrebrod) but broadened the offerings. The decor is a bit darker then it used to be, which is too bad, but then they added some tables on the sidewalk which is pretty awesome when the weather is good! It's still a lovely, airy, neigbourhood café.

The menu is simple and under $20. There is a table d'hote if you're feeling fancy, and it includes an appetizer, a main dish, and a coffee (no dessert!). I got the gravlax plate, served with a very sauced up salad. It doesn't look like much, but it is very filling, the salmon is super fat - in the best way. The meatballs are also deceptive, you only get 3, but they are heavy, and actually spicy! Only con: service is a bt slow. I should hang out there more!
