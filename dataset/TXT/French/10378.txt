4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I love this place, me and the gf went here and it was awesome. We sat inside and the atmosphere was crazy. Just buzzing. We both had the classic steak frites and it was an awesome piece of meat. Next time I would love to sit outside across from the Bellagio. I put in the reservations that we were celebrating our anniversary and the waiter gave us a free cheesecake. It was an awesome experience.
