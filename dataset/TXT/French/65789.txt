ucgzkl7atsBMGu4gGpmHfw I don't have a clue why this place has only 3 1/2 stars on Yelp as I write this. My wife and I had brunch there today and we could not have enjoyed it more. The food was excellent in quality, taste and presentation. We can recommend the scrambled eggs with lox, Marscapone, delightfully crisped capers, and crusty toast. Also, the scones with homemade mixed-berry jam, the fresh-squeezed juices, and more. The service was excellent--friendly and efficient. Every staff person we dealt with - - four in total - - couldn't have been nicer. Even though they were busy, the wait for the food was not long, and no one made us feel rushed. All-in-all, a five-star experience.
