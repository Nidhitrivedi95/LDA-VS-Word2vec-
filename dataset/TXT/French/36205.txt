hzyvL2v97xLzLbLXcdi1uw I tried the ham and swiss crêpe and a cappuccino today. They were both okay, but I wasn't overly impressed - the cappuccino was not one of the better ones I've had in the area, and the crêpe had a big thick (1/2 inch?) slice of ham in it, complete with gristly bits which were hard to cut. At other places, it's usually thin sliced luncheon meats which I think works better in this scenario. The side salad it comes with was fine, but not especially exciting. On the plus side, they have a couple of outdoor tables which work well on a pleasant day, and the interior has an appealing cozy ambience. The service was also prompt and friendly.
