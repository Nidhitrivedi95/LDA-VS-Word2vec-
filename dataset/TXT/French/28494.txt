EG3drsohiIrBewmOYMNEuA I had the Grilled or poached salmon served with rice, vegetables provincial tomato and dill sauce.  The menu said grilled or poached, they didn't ask which way I wanted it cooked.  It seems like the default cooking method is poached.  There is a nice casual atmosphere and a decent mix of items on the menu.
