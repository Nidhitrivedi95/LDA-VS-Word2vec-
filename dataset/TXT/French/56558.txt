rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A My wife and I went here for breakfast while staying at the Palazzo. We didn't get a chance to smear at the Bouchon in Yountville when we went so we weren't going to miss Bouchon a second time, and we are very glad we didn't. She has amazing eggs benedict and I had a very good croquet madame that came with a mountain of delicious pomme frittes. The pastries also looked amazing but we were too stuffed to try them.
