vLkKorA1gPS97Zj0_WKA0Q I honestly can't say enough good things about this restaurant. The food was on point and the service was even better. Anthony was amazing and was truly an ambassador for the restaurant. He guided us through each course. The langoustine app was amazing, the foie gras was excellent, my scallop entree was delicious and my boyfriend's duck was wonderful as well. Every dish seemed like you got more than you bargained for in the best way, really challenging your perceptions of each ingredient. Thank you for the amazing anniversary and we hope to dine with you in Vegas again soon!!
