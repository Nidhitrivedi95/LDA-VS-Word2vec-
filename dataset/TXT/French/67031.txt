USleI8g1UVN9-9jm-b4uIg I really don't understand all the rave reviews for this restaurant.  Some of my favorite restaurants are prime steakhouses like, Del Frisco's and The Palm so maybe my standards are a little high but I do like trying local independent restaurants so I thought I would give the Fig Tree a try.  

The menu here is very diverse and contains items you typically will not find in most restaurants like Ostrich and Elk, however, the quality, in my opinion is average at best.  The starter salad did not taste fresh and was very bland.  The Elk was so tough I had to ask the server to bring me a sharper knife so I could cut into it.  The two sides served with the Elk were strange and also very bland.  

The atmosphere and the service was exceptional, however, because of my food experience I will not be dining at The Fig again.
