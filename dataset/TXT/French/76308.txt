Yp9w4nhUowBU_IS_StFXbQ What a wonderful experience we had on Sunday for breakfast. Amanda and Elizabeth went above and beyond their kindness and my family and I will never forget. Believe it or not it was very chilly outside and we hadn't made reservations for breakfast which I knew you need for lunch but I didn't think for breakfast . But they took great care of us and helped us get inside after they saw my sons were shivering.
And the breakfast was of excellent quality.
