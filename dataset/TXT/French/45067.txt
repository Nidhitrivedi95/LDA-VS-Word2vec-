mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q I was so disappointed about L'Atelier... Maybe I'm comparing it to Alinea and it does not even come close (I know Alinea is double the price, but still). The three of us got the Seasonal Tasting menu (10 courses). The Amuse-bouche -- foie gras parfait, was really good. Then from the 2nd course on, it just went downhill for me. The 2nd course was this cold dish -- celery mousse with a beef gelee. I felt like I was eating the congealed fat of a beef stew my mom would make. I was so grossed out that I had to return it and have the chef make me something different, which was better, but not amazing. Next was the sea scallops, which was so bland and tasteless, that I had to ask for salt. (And if you know me, I rarely alter food by adding more salt or sauce) It was only the beginning of my meal, and I was already disappointed. Every course after that was just mediocre. Nothing really stood out... Except maybe the dessert (which I liked), but still don't really remember it. Meh...

The only reason I'm giving L'Atelier 3 stars is because of the restaurant layout and the head chef. I liked the open kitchen so you can watch the chefs cook right in front of you (we sat at the bar area). The head chef really took a liking to my friend that was dining with us. He gave us quite a nice portion of seared foie gras (not part of our tasting menu), and that was, of course, really delicious. After our meal, we also got a private tour of the back kitchen and also the adjoining Joel Robuchon kitchen and met their head chef! My experience was good, but the food definitely was not...
