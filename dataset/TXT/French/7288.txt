4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw My bf and I decided to eat dinner here this pass weekend. The appetizers were amazing.We ordered the baked scallops and a Cesar salad. 
 We also ordered two fliet mignon they were delicious. We would definitely come here again. The price of the food was totally worth it. :) This restaurant is a gem in Las Vegas.
