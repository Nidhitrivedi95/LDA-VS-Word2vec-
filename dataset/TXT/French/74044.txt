xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g I'll have to write an update to this place once I actually try the food here, so my 5-star rating may or may not be slightly overstated. I've been here precisely three times, but only for dessert items and dessert wines after dinner at other places and to enjoy the view of the Bellagio fountains; what a lovely view by the way.

They have a chocolate mousse cake for the chocolate lovers that's really great--not too strong of a flavor such that it gets caught in your throat but will definitely satisfy your sweet tooth. I've also tried their lemon-raspberry treat on another occasion, equally as good with a raspberry sauce that compliments the dessert just like you'd expect. All downed with a Moscato and all is well with the world.

... and the view of those fountains just makes for a lovely evening.
