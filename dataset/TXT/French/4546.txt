2gUbgbdJ7IFSbicBXlSchw Thank you for taking the time to read my review.  I had great expectations for the restaurant, food , staff and ambience.  Unfortunately, none of the above delivered.  The best was the expensive bottle  of Bordeaux that I ordered and had to pour for myself.  Stay away from the Crostini with the goat cheese salad, you need to have a direct line to your Dentist so that your teeth can be fixed after eating in this restaurant.  Govern yourself accordingly.

Do not look for the staff to ask you how your meal is, it doesn't happen.
