MdjIl105vqCYUGKFSUVytA Went for the Sunday brunch buffet. We had a reservation and it's highly recommended that you make one. The variety would appeal to anyone and they had a nice amount of fresh seafood to choose from. Lots of salads and hot items such as eggs benedict with a really amazing hollandaise sauce. I wish we caught our servers name because she was excellent which always adds to the experience.
I would definitely go back.
