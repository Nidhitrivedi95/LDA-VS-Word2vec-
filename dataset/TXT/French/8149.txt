Both dishes were amazing but the French toast was certainly memorable, it had a buttery crust with amazing whipped cream and blueberry sauce really complimented the whole dish. The Benedict was great too...especially as the lamb soaked the gorgeous yolk and you took a bite of it with the mushroom....mmmhh.
