4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Went twice for breakfast - much easier to get in early.  The patio seating in nice - especially for people watching, but a good meal can be had anywhere inside.

The eggs benedict and steak and eggs were huge, and the muffins are pretty tasty and filling too.  The make-your-own Bloody Mary's is a fun diversion - you're your own best or worst enemy there.

Friendly hostesses and servers, lots of life and activity.  Great laid back restaurant.
