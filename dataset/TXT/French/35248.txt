Ht-_i0UAq7YDBaqJwcQMdQ I ate here over the summer for the first time and the food was like art on a plate! It's very pricey and the portions are small but the food quality and taste was excellent. The menu choices were pretty limited so to start i went with the seared scallops, they were perfectly cooked and tasty but it had a sweet sauce that i was not too fond of. As a main i had the surf n' turf which the server recommended. It was delicious! Lobsters claws with a nice juicy and tender fillet mignon. One of the best things I've ever eaten! *I have photos :)
