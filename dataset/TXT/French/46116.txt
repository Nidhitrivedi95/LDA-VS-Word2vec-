On my one and only visit here so far, the service was definitely above average (when compared to other restaurants that serve a similar customer base). The dining area is pleasantly warm and inviting.

There is plenty of variety on the menu, so you'll probably find a burger that suits your tastebuds without too much deliberation. The Boheme was a delicious choice. The french fries could possibly be improved, but overall the meal was quite satisfying.

Must-try item: The milshakes are absolutely amazing here and are enough to bring me back.

One of the bonuses of this Queen West gem is that you can dine in and enjoy the licensed bar, or take your meal to go. The classic burger will only set you back $7 (takeout only). This is one of those places you can bring friends to, or better yet enjoy all by yourself. The burgers are substantial and made very well. It can get a tad pricey but they're definitely worth a try.
