xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g This has been on my excel document of go to's for a long while now and was finally fulfilled last year. 

It was dinner time and we took an elevator up to the level of the restaurant and once you get out, there is a hostess waiting for you. You see the kitchen immediately and the hostess brings you to your table. We didn't have to wait at all. 

Just as I hoped for, we got a table right by the window. Perfect view of the Bellagio and their water show. The only thing that ruined the view was cloudy sky. But I wasn't going to let that ruin my dinner.

The waiter was on top of everything and our glasses were never empty. I ordered the Baked Alaskan Halibut with vegetables and a side of potato gratin. I ordered the side because I had a feeling the portions would be small, but boy was I wrong. The fish was huge and the sauces so delicious. 

For dessert we had the chocolate souffle, which I must say, is DELICIOUS! I still remember the sweet warm chocolate melting in my mouth. Ah, I'd definitely just return for dessert.

The only reason why I am giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is for one thing. When I took my first bite into my fish, there was a bone in it. And that's just not right. At least it was the only bone in my fish I found.
