-gSmWgHBhIU-l7GFs1C7ew This places does it right.

I spent 6 months in Montreal gorging myself like some fat Roman senator of old, and this is one places that stands out in my mind for a few reasons.

First, it's small and intimate, the kind of place that locals know and introduce each other to. 

Secondly, the staff are friendly, efficient, and very knowledgeable. As odd as it may sound, they know their food. 

Thirdly, they support fair trade, which isn't something I've seen in a restaurant before. It may be just the coffee or it may be more, but the fact remains that they seem to have a social consciousness about themselves.

And the food is simply delicious. I had the horse tenderloin and it was fantastic. The duck is also amazing. 

While a little on the pricey side for the food, the cost is more than made up for on the BYOB side. Bring-your-own places should become more popular as it allows a greater focus on quality food.

Next time I'm in Montreal, I'm definitely going back to Les Infideles.
