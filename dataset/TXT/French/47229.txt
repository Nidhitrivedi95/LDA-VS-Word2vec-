O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q Enjoyed our lunch here today. Probably more like a 3.5 star but I'm rounding up for good service and a great outdoor table- love eating outside. Onion soup was perfect, salad Nicoise was tasty. Got the artichoke flatbread which was a special for the artichoke festival (?) and that was just ok.  Happy hour 2 for 1 well drinks all afternoon were a nice
Bonus.
