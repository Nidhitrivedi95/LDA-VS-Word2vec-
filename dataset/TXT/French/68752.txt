All seasonal and mostly local ingredient are made from scrap in the kitchen. Eat healthy and in season if you called yourself " eating healthy "

Slightly Baked Pear salad with blue cheese and nuts on top...it's almost a warm salad. Very soothing and welcoming for a Sunday brunch. Sweet, juicy, with note of blue cheese add the layer intensity. 

Beef Tongue egg Benny...you heard me right! Sliced beef tongue with egg Benny, just go an try it. Lobster egg Benny is overrated, and salmon egg Benny is always classic. 

My love  is the Pork Belly little Pasta with Porched egg & parmesan cheese ...Pork is Roasted perfectly that taste almost like steak. Fresh made little pasta( I believe it's a homemade pasta, if you ever made a pasta by yourself, you can taste the super freshness and chewy texture in it) and caramelized onion all together with beautiful onions petals & Porched egg on top! 

Coming back already
