hvjgF-vnPw2jyL5DBuB0qg I've eaten here before and we loved it, however this experience was completely different. We had a reservation for 8:45, and when we showed up at 8:47 were told that our table had been given up to another group because we were late and they hadn't been able to reach us. We honestly thought she was joking because it seemed so ridiculous. Apparently we had one digit  wrong in our phone number and because we didn't call to say we'd be late, and "15 groups hadn't shown up all night" they decided to give our table away. The hostess was dismissive and unapologetic and blamed us for being late. We are really easy going and reasonable people but it was so frustrating and upsetting to be treated so poorly. We know the food is good from previous experience  but the service was really really disappointing.
