FRuuIDOd21pTJHvEGIt1Gg The Yelp Reviews Did Not Disappoint Our  Expectations. As Soon As You Walk In You're Greeted and Immediately Seated. Love The Floor Plan, Atmosphere and Music Playlist. If You Like Red Meat, May I Recommend The Hangar Steak. The Duck Confit Is Another Favorite, The Meat Was So Tender and Delish. For Those Who Love Raw Fish,  The Salmon Tartar Is Another Must Have. Our Server Was Friendly,  Courteous and Outright Professional. Holder Resides Between The Finl District snd Old Montreal.
