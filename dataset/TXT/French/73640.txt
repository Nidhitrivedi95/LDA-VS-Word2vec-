xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g Went here for dinner one night while in Vegas for vacation. I didn't know my boyfriend was going to propose to me here, and I must say everything was amazing. They accommodated us with the best seat in the house, the service was wonderful and the food was absolutely delicious. I would highly recommend this place to couples looking for a romantic dinner on the strip.
