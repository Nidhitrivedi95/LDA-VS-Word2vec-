sphMzEIqY1I2Dzv3zLZY2g My wife and I brought my father to Global Restaurant for his 75th birthday. We all loved it. The food was amazing as usual (my wife and I have been to global a couple of times before). Bernard is a wonderful chef, prepare to be impressed !! The live music was great !! The service was outstanding !! Great night !!
