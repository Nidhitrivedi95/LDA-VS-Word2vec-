2gUbgbdJ7IFSbicBXlSchw I have been wanting to have a meal at L'express after reading all these Yelp reviews. I guess setting my expectation too high left me a little disappointed. 

Making a reservation using Opentable was just so convenient. I was though really surprised  that the restaurant was not busy on a Sunday afternoon. 

But I doubt I going to have what we ordered for lunch regularly as I can feel my arteries clogging up... 

Bone Marrow, Veal Kidney, Croque-Monsieur were all quite heavy and I was ready for afternoon nap after my lunch! Those pickles on the side though was delicious as it helped with my digestion and I just couldn't stop eating those!

Service here was excellent. The deco and vibe is classical French Bistro.

But I just not feeling it... maybe I was just too full after all these eating. Or maybe I should go all the way and order foie gras instead!
