SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA Great place to get some french cuisine. Went to L'Albatros with a couple of friends and got after it with trying a little bit of everything. Was really digging the charcuterie platter and the french toast appetizer really got the taste buds firing. i could go for some more right now. All and all great place to eat, nice dining area service was solid.  I also like the fact of how much pork is on the menu. Pork is gods animal.
