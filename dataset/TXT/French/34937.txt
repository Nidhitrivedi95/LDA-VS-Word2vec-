HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw Even though the foie gras ban was lifted in CA right before my trip, I was still in Vegas to eat foie! A bunch of my friends had been to Comme Ca and enjoyed the foie, so I wanted to try it. Unfortunately, the day we went, they didn't have foie on the menu. After drooling over all the pix on Yelp, I was so disappointed. Luckily, I asked our waiter and he in turn asked the chef. The chef made me a special foie appetizer! Yay!

*Cardamom & fig old fashioned: house made cardamom & fig infused rye, brown sugar, aromatic bitters ($15)
I really enjoyed this. Sometimes old fashioneds can be be a little too sweet for me, but this was nicely balanced.

*Board of the beast: mustard fruits, grilled country bread ($22)
This is huge! The roommate loves charcuterie so we normally order it if a restaurant serves it. A nice variety of meats. Also, you get pickles with this, so no need to order the house pickles if you get the charcuterie. (Can you tell we were going to order it?! Lol!)

*French onion soup: sweet onion, melted gruyere cheese ($12)
This was slightly too sweet for me. The soup had great flavor though. And the melted gruyere was nice and cheesy!

*Frisee aux lardons: 7-minute egg, crispy pig fries, warm bacon vinaigrette ($14)
Okay, this was just plain bad. The egg was super salty and the frisee didn't taste dressed. The salad needed some kind of vinegar or citrus to cut into the salty egg and bacon. This was definitely the worst dish.

*Bone marrow & oxtail jam: parsley, shallot, lemon ($16)
The bone marrow was delish! Soft and buttery. They give you a lot of oxtail jam. Not sure if this was meant to be eaten together, but there wasn't enough bone marrow to eat with all the oxtail jam.

*Beef tartare: olive oil poached egg yolk, house pickles, grilled country bread ($16)
This tasted fine, but I had a texture issue with the tartare. It was chopped a little too fine, so the texture was really mushy.

*Foie gras torchon & Seared foie gras: app special ($30)
I ate this whole thing all by myself! I told our server I wanted a nice seared foie app. Imagine my surprise when I got both seared foie and foie gras torchon! I was super happy!

So in all, without the foie, I'd probably give Comme Ca 3 or 3.5 stars for the food. Some dishes were good, but there was no excuse for that awful salad. Given I got my foie fix, 4 stars it is!
