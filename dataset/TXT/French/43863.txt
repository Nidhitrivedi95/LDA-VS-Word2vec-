I've been there twice:  The first time, I was so excited to find a creperie here but was disappointed in how rude the owner/waiter was.  The second time was because I was trying to give him the benefit of the doubt and a second chance.  But never again!  On the second time we went there for breakfast, before I could even finish my plate, the waiter/owner came up from behind me and grabbed my knife by the blade and grabbed my plate.  First of all, it was very obvious that I wasn't finished yet.  Second, he just grabbed it without asking if I was finished or still working on my food, as common courtesy dictates.  He just came up from behind me and grabbed my silverware and plate before I even realized what was going on.  It was actually my friend sitting across the table from me who stopped him and said I wasn't finished yet.  And when she did, the guy just dropped my knife back on the plate (the knife which he held with his hand on the blade--not the handle--the blade, dropped the plate back in front of me, and walked away without apologizing or saying a single word.  It was so disgustingly rude!  I never went back there again, and I never will.  There are so many other great places in Scottsdale to which I would rather give my business.
