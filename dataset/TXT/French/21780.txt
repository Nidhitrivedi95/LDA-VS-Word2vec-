Bf-yMQiSmDZyqfGyFKQ0bA Found this place by accident and loved it! Cool venue, Pittsburgh centric, non-chain.
Really fresh food...hot pastrami and bbq port tacos were perfect.  Great onion straws, light batter and not overly greasy.
Best part,  infused vodkas and gin for 1/2 price martinis on Sunday.
Will definitely go back.
Good beer selection, no crap, as their sign says!
