UpEVdq_euH-5mqCIgUAd2Q Been there many times and always enjoyed my meals and the exceptional service. Today, I've decided to take my friends from out of town to try their brunch...utterly disappointing!

I ordered the Crepe with salmon...came in quick however was super dry and the salmon was tasteless. Also, the service while ok is not what I came to expect from them. The server was passive aggressive and our table of 5 felt restricted and dumb when asking questions about dishes they wanted to order! 

I couldn't complete my salmon crepe and had to sent it back. To be fair, they did remove my order from the bill and while I appreciated the gesture, I left hungry and disappointed.   

I'm not sure if I would ever go back for brunch, obviously it's not the same kitchen or service staff that I got accustomed to.
