9ot8oInkYZTt6wkkGe__vQ Came here for the Winterlicious lunch menu. Left quite disappointed. The service was undeniably slow, the entire lunch service taking just over 2 hours. The entrée, a beef hashé, was badly botched. Of the five guests at our table who ordered the hashé, the meat ranged from rare to well done even though it was all intended to be cooked one way. I'm not sure how this even happens. 

One of our guests waited 5 minutes for cutlery while the rest of the party ate. Eventually she had to get up and ask herself. It's surprising for this to happen at an expensive place that doubtlessly prides itself as a best-in-class service establishment. In all, a very disappointing $40 lunch. Maybe they just don't care about Winterlicious guests. Why take part, then?
