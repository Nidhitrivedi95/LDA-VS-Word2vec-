RfsMUrGUJdrpfrU54rmEsQ My girlfriend took me here for my birthday and it was perfect! The atmosphere was great! They had live music, friendly staff, and the food was amazing! We started with the chorizo app (so tasty) and some drinks (beer & wine only). I had the duck breast & was extremely pleased with my choice! My gf had the filet mignon, which was the best tasting steak I can remember eating! The whole experience was amazing. We will be going back!
