0B_aEPeZjrXs6T7vS3arrA I've eaten lunch at Sophie's several times and have always been impressed.  What this restaurant does with an omelet should be patented.  That said, my  experience with dinner is not so favorable.  My wife and I recently joined friends for Sophie's prix fix dinner with wine parings.  The meal started with fried sweetbreads.  Frankly, sweetbreads are generally too delicate for frying and this was certainly the case with our meals.  Chewing and tasting of frying oil, they were the worst sweetbreads I've eaten.  To top it off, they paired the dish with a cloyingly sweet rose that tasted more like Two-Buck Chuck than a serious wine pairing.  The meal did not improve any with its scallop or short rib courses, both of which were paired with equally unctuous wines.  The coup de gras was the gelato dessert, reminiscent of cheap raspberry sherbet.  Sophie's can do better.  For almost $80pp, they darn well better start soon.
