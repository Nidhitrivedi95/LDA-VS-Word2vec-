ysJo5Jdo29XOBCnKrbUKWg I've been to Paris 66 4 or 5 times. The first couple times I dined here in mid 2012 were fantastic. The food was authentic and prepared well and the macarons were the best I'd had anywhere (yes I think they're better than Laduree). The macarons still are the best, although you now have to buy them at Gaby et Jules in Squirrel Hill up the street. Anyway, the last couple of times I went here, once in early 2013 and now in early 2014 were just ok. The service and decor are awesome and very charming, but the quality of the food has really taken a dive. We all started with french onion soup which was very good and I would highly recommend, but all of the entrees were mediocre. Two of us ordered salads and the lettuce was wilted and didn't taste fresh. My husband had veal, which was cooked to the point that he could hardly cut or chew it. I had salmon that was so undercooked that I couldn't eat anything but the edges (I ordered it medium). I want to like Paris 66 so much and there's a ton of potential there, but they need to step up their food game. Charging $20+ for so-so entrees isn't going to fly for long.
