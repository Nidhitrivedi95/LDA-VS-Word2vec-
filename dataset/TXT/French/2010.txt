0nddnkjG1RV8hdFdy_wCMA Let me start off with what I love about this place. For me, it reminds me of those charming little bakery/cafes sprinkled across Montreal. Really, you can just step into Pain Perdu , order some pastry and a cafe au lait, sit back and pretend you just took the VIA train from Toronto to Montreal. To make the experience even more believable all the staff are French and even the radio is tuned to a French station. It's all there to be soaked in, right on St. Clair Ave W., Montreal here I come.

OK, about the croissants...They are really good. In my top three for Toronto assuredly. I'll have to go back to try out their other offerings. As for the coffee well...It's OK but not the greatest. Perhaps I was underwhelmed as I had briefly stopped at Cafe Noir for a delicious espresso shot before coming to Pain Perdu.

As I mentioned, I need to go back and try more of their food and pastries to give a proper review. One thing I did notice that was rather odd was the fact that their croque-monsieur is prepared ahead of time and then rewarmed to serve. Literally I see a stack of them behind the counter glass, already cooked, just...Sitting their looking most unappetizing. For a place that specializes in fresh baked bread I find it strange that they wouldn't make the croque-monsieur to order.

As for service it is quite good, very attentive.

I'm giving the place 3 stars for now and will update my review upon subsequent visits. 

Worth noting is if you are on the hunt for foie gras they got it.
