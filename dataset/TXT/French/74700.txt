xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g Nice view of the Bellagio fountain show. Great ambience. Awesome service.  Wasn't too impressed with the food though. It was decent but too pricey for what it is. I must admit though that the creme brûlée was delish!

I will not be coming back again. There are so many other restaurants in Vegas that offer better food than this place.
