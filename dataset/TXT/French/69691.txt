WOd8tWsh2Yt_osHv-ngx_w JJ and I woke up early one day in Montreal to find snow gently beginning to fall, so we stayed close to the hotel for breakfast. We walked into Universel shortly after it opened, so there was no crowding at all. We both got coffee to get us going before settling on what to order. 

I liked the wide variety of eggs Benedict and omelets offered on the menu and it took me a while to decide. I ended up having the smoked salmon benedict, which also came with a cup of fresh fruit and home fries. Everything was really good--the salmon wasn't too fishy, and the home fries were really well-seasoned. 

All in all, this was a great start to the morning--we didn't have to wait for a table, the service was fast, and we ate our fill before heading off to start the day's adventure.
