I've been twice. Once for dinner with a girlfriend and the other for Thanksgiving my freshman year of college. I can't remember what my girlfriend and I got and this was only a few years ago, but not to the food's detriment, only to our detailing, because we always remembered it as being delicious and very well done. Plus we were really drunk. We definitely had no complaints, but we were not as picky then also. 

Thanksgiving dinner was really good. That in itself is amazing, considering it was a fixed menu night and everyone in the restaurant was eating the exact same plates. It was not as I expected, a basic substitute for not eating home cooking. Not at all. It was worth being away from home. Granted the turkey was the blandest thing on the plate, but it was a beautiful bland. The sides and fixings were each equally satisfying. If you're traveling here during the holidays, I'd suggest this restaurant for sure. 

Service, ambiance and presence match the price. Can't speak for much else. Will definitely go back and update this review.
