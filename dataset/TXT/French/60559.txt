SCklYa_jhihWAcfIn-_chg We had: 
croissant: I don't see this place having the best croissant in Toronto. It is good, but not stupendous. Just normal.
Brioche: dry. The crust makes it taste like the same dough as the croissant. Their brioche makes me feel bad for paying 1,90 for it.
French toast: shameful called as French toast. A chocolatish bread that they did something (??) and dropped some fruits so they can charge 10,50 for it. Tasteless unless you cover (more like soak) with the syrup. The crust on the top of the bread (probably 5% of the slice) is ok, but that is it.
Cappuccino: average.
We also paid additional 50 cents for the butter, a shame triangular unsalted measuring approx 2cm x 2 cm (isosceles) that we needed to ask 4 times to get.
We almost walked away for the waiting time (and the place is not full), and we should have.

My advice: if you are following the lists of "places to try" and are willing to pay for anything, go ahead. If you want the best food, look elsewhere.
