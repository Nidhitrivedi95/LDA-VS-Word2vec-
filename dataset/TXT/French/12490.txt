4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw The first time I went was with a large group and we all loved our server and the food. And the Bloody Mary bar. The second time I went with a small group. Hated the flavourless cold soggy steak sandwich and the totally clueless server. Everything he described - based on which we ordered - was just wrong. Not even close to real. I'd say skip it and find someplace else.
