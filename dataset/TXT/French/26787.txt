Da6eZFThE9xanUAGNpZxAg The summerlicious menu was good! My husband and I thought the best choices were the fried artichoke (appetizer), the pork jowl (main), and the chocolate mousse. We also had the game meatballs, fish main, and the panna cotta, which we didn't think were nearly as good as the first set of dishes I listed. However, it was about $74 (after tax and tip) for two people.
