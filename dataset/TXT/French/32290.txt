Walk past everything on the casino floor to the elevator up to Alize and take in the best view of Las Vegas while experiencing one of its best gastronomic performances.  If you can snag a window table, and there are many, you will never forget the time well spent.  Service is attentive and informed, wonderful wines, sublime menu, and a hearty check.  Loved it.
