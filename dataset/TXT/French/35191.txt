hsJ0Ma7RB_dmzAY8H0mu7g This comfortably elegant restaurant is well worth the trip to a somewhat isolated part of Ste Catherine, well beyond the buzz of the Village. We were group of twenty who sampled all over the menu, from arctic char to black pudding. Food was consistently excellent and beautifully presented. Servers were somewhat overwhelmed, but I'd guess that with a smaller group or a slower night, they'd do just fine.
