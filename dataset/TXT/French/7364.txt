My fiancé and I shared the special, open face lamb sandwich , and the salmon and spinach salad. Both were amazing! Rosa suggested the sangría as a great compliment to our food and she was right. We also ordered the fruit bouquet and for desert the blueberry crépe for him and the strawberry cake for me. May I suggest, sharing deserts, they are huge! We didn't finish. Definitely try this place when you're at París, Las Vegas.
