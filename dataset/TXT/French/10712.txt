4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Super affordable place inside Paris. They have steaks, salads, wines, desserts and more. I ordered the salad with the bacon and poached egg. Super yummy. My girlfriend ordered their french onion soup and said it was really great as well. My favorite had to be the baked brie appetizer. SO delicious. It had honey, garlic, and chestnuts in it. What a concept. 

We didn't have a reservation so we sat at the bar tables next to the Christmas tree. It was actually super pretty. I didn't mind at all. If you want a table though, better make a reservation in advance, especially on weekends. 

Service was friendly and helpful. There are also vegetarian options as well. Would definitely recommend!
