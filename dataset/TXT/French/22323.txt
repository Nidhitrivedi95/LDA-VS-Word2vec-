BSmqxPbQglQwP2R56OqOag It's hard for me to really say what's wrong with local now... Its hard because one year ago this wasn't a bad place. The owner has cut corners big time and the business is suffering. 

With Spiga so close and North killing the game, don't waste your time here. Local's quality has gone down big time and the staff turnover is unbelievable. 

Go somewhere else.
