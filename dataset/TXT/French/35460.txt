htQgj-ANQpZGpIpkkrEmyQ This is my go-to place for friend dates and date dates...but make sure to call ahead. Don't expect walk ins. I've been turned away 2-3 times because of waits over an hour. The INSP burger and pulled pork fries are my fix. I'd say inspire is probably the best fusion restaurant in Markham. I'm glad there is somewhere to go after living in Chicago.
