4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw What an adorable place for a lunch or brunch! If your timing is good or if you're willing to wait, the patio is the perfect place to enjoy your meal. Unfortunately, the patio was closed for a private event when I was there. 

My family and I stopped by for a Sunday lunch/brunch. Their menu has a good variety of items so everyone should be able to find something they want. That morning, the warm chicken and brie sandwich was calling my name and I had to answer. I loved my sandwich! It was warm and creamy from the brie, sweet from the caramelized onions, and a bit tart from the green apples. I think I may have to re-create this combination at home! Accompanying my sandwich was a cone full of their fries. I'm not sure if I'd call them fries though. They were flat and wider than other fries which made them crispy in some places. It was more of a cross between a fry and a chip, a "frip" if you will. 

I also sampled the croque monsieur and the chicken and mushroom crepe from my family members. Both were tasty as well! My one complaint is that the butter that came with our demi baguette was cold. Why was it cold? The bread wasn't warm so the cold butter didn't make sense. 

For a nice restaurant on the Vegas strip, the prices seemed pretty reasonable. The space was a bit cramped though. Be prepared to potentially bump elbows with the person at the next table.
