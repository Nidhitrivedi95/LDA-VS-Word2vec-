BSmqxPbQglQwP2R56OqOag I took my friend here for brunch for her birthday. Plus they had unlimited mimosas. Lol

I ordered the wild mushroom omelette. This comes with mushrooms, white wine cream sauce, Gruyere and a side of potatoes. They weren't kidding about wild mushrooms. Because this was smothered in mushrooms. I think they went overboard with it and should've added more veggies. However it white wine cream sauce was excellent. The unlimited mimosas is quite a steal. $12 on Sundays with penny refills. Unfortunately I only made it to three. Lol

Our waitress was very attentive and always made sure we were taken care of. I loved the ambience of the restaurant. I felt like I wasn't even in Arizona. It felt like a restaurant I would find in la. I'd like to come back to try their dinner menu but it's quite a drive for me.
