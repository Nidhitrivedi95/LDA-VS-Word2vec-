HOev_2CifUcfIm9xDL_uaw Great discovery. My romantic husband knowing how I long to visit Paris found this cafe to take me for Valentines Day. We went for breakfast. Delightful atmosphere, loved the artwork and decor. My husband chose the almond croissant, different than expected but delicious. I loved my cafe latte and I chose a crepe special, had just the right amount of jam inside 2 light crepes, also included scrambled eggs, so fluffy and perfectly seasoned with pepper, and 2 pieces of delicious bacon. The owner is very friendly and welcoming. Prices are very reasonable. Can't wait to go back!
