SBnpT6JDbah-5l_52GM5sw This is one of our favorite spots for meatless Fridays:  a great selection of seafood on the menu, and additional special entrees.  Arrive between 4 and 6 for the happy hour oyster special (there are two east coast and two west coast every day).  Also one of the best Sunday brunches around (can't go wrong with the omelet and frites).
