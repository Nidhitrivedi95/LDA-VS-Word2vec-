xaqW4NkmUCGRRjmLxiFJ6Q Saw the great reviews on yelp and had to try this place out.  Always a bit skeptical when you see this many great reviews for a place, but after trying it you can see why.

Great service - especially when you say it's your first time.  These guy definitely kill it here! 

Great food

Great customizations

And, fantastic Cane Juice!

Only downfalls are:
- hard to find location, but it seems the best places always are, so that they can devote more profit to the service / quality of food
- no vegan cheese or vegan mayo based sauces (I.e. Vegenaise and Daiya cheese).  Suggestion:  carry it and charge a premium, but at least have a comparable vegan option).
