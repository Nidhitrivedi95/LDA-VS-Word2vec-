s1NqIkLMCFX6PuTk6wt6QA Dinner spot in the Plateau. I went there to try their brunch but was not offered during the week only in the week end. It's sad because it will be a great idea to propose breakfast everyday and we were not the only one in the restaurant interested by that. They proposed omelets but that's not my favorite option. So i'll probably come back. During the week they propose a comfort food menu, with several choices of poutine, salads, sandwiches and burger. I took the Club sandwich, a huge portion, really well done and well presented with the salad. The service was nice, warm and efficient. I loved the place so cute, I might changed my rating after trying the brunch .... :)
