1ThbwFVBL9YA2oOM11iO7g Delux has been my favourite regular place now for several months if not a year now.

The place has a beautiful vibe and feel, and my partner and I take family and friends here with confidence. The staff really make the experience, they know how to tell you about the food, what to expect, etc. They've been helpful in picking wines--btw the Hungarian (not sure if it's available still) was a great find.

The steak frites is a favorite. Scallops are beautiful. 

Deserts ... the crème brulée is a superlative. Not on the menu any more, but there was an exquisite pastry desert.

Unlike Boehmer across the street, Delux is a little more in tune with the Ossington/Queen W vibe, if I can put it that way. Not trying quite so hard (and by that I don't mean working hard, just, cooler).

Btw.. the bread that comes with every meal is, I believe, house made, and has a beautiful unique texture and flavour.
