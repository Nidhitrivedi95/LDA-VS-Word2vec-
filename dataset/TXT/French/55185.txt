rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Perhaps one of my favorite places in Vegas. Thomas Keller's restaurant really blows me away as some of the best food I've had in Vegas.

They also let my scraggly ass in when I was hardly dressed for an outdoor club let alone a decent place like this. Granted it was the late afternoon so I wasn't sticking out like a sore thumb in a crowd of nicely dressed diners, but that still gets this place bonus points.

Hint: If you're on a budget, come here anyway and drop 8 bucks or whatever on the french fries. They are easily the best I've ever had.
