hvjgF-vnPw2jyL5DBuB0qg Having been a Chuck Hughes fan ever since his first season on The Food Network, I had the biggest expectations going in. Truthfully, those expectations were far surpassed. 
I got the chicken dish of the night and it was just pure heavenly bliss on a platter. 
The inside is very hip and fun. The real bonus of the night, was the super attractive staff......
For desert we had to get the deep fried mars bar, and I don't know the last time I had ever experienced such a perfect taste. A super simple concept, but oh my dear dear lord was it wonderful.
I just can't wait to go back...!
