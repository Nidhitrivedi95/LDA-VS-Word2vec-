ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug I was with a couple of friends who were starving at 4am (lolz) and we thought of this place, open all night! :)

It took us awhile to be seated even though it was 4 am, hmphhh. The menu looked promising, though expensive. I wasn't super hungry, so I just ordered the Clam Chowder, which was suprisingly delicious! Lots of clams and not too many potatoes (I HATE when there are too many potatoes) AND it wasn't too heavy. My friends also seemed to enjoy their food. It did take awhile, but I guess that makes sense at 4am.

The waiters were nice enough, but I feel like it was difficult and took forever to get our check. We were all really sleepy, as it was very late at night and we had eaten until our bellies were full, so this was a great annoyance.

Overall, the food is decent, expensive (but what isn't in Las Vegas?), but the service was a little shaky. I appreciate that this place is open late, but I think I'll be trying some other restaurants the next time I venture into Paris.
