Fd25lEnclIwyWlSRgkbRfg Being a south side resident, I hadn't tried this place out until last night. It was an amazing meal and good experience overall. I don't know much about French cuisine so didn't really have any expectations. Our waiter seemed like he was plucked from Paris the night before. He was very knowledgeable and friendly and patiently explained the menu items to us. He also provided recommendations which were helpful. 

The bread is really tasty and freshly warm from the oven. My boyfriend ordered the Bistro salad and we split the scallop appetizers. The scallops were served with a leek cream sauce and were made to perfection. 

We both ordered Steak Au Poivre, which is served with a dijon brandy sauce our server made in the dining room over an open flame. Steaks were cooked exactly as we had hoped and the sauce was delicious. Served on the side were frites which we dipped in our steak sauce. Yummy.

The server suggested that day's special dessert, which I'll never remember the name of but which he described as "egg whites and candied fruit, put in the freezer for 2 days'. It was incredibly light and served slab-like. 

The owner came over to our table multiple times to check on us. He introduced himself by name and shook both of our hands. 

Overall - very impressed with the service and food. The price was reasonable. I'll definitely be going back!
