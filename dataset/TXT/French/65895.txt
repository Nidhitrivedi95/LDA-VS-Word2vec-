Ud5FqhVC8AdZg9RLzNW_Wg What a lovely new place in the East end of Toronto.  The vibe is relaxed and the service was exceptionally friendly.  My group of 5 girls enjoyed the escargots, duck confit, and fish specials.  We're a diverse group so having us all agree on the great service and food is truly rare.  I finished off with a latte and the rest said they enjoyed their desserts of cheesecake and creme brulee.  We're def going back when they start serving brunch as well.
