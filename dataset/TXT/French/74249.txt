Service excellent. Attentive but not hovering. 

Our food sub-standard for the price and the main reason I gave this restaurant only 3 stars. 

I had the venison which was dry and tasteless. Only saving grace was the sauce they provided with it. Not worth a tenth of he $65 they charged for it.  The view beautiful, though. 

My wife had the duck which was tough and chewy. Again, the sauce made this bearable. Did I mention the view?

Okay soufflé dessert was good, so I'll give them that. 

Overall, with all the quality restaurants in Vegas, this one not worth the money. View nice, however.
