YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g The $35 "Fleur Burger" was good, but somehow did not live up to the "hype" that it received. Perhaps it was because I was sharing the burger with my boss who was complaining how expensive the burger was? Perhaps it was also because it did not come with fois gras and truffles and you have to ask them to be added to your burger? I don't know. I would have to try to get this the next time someone else is footing the bill again without complaining about the hefty price.
