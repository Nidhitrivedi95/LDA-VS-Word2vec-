58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw This is my go-to brunch place. My boyfriend and I are here almost every weekend, without fail, and the staff knows us. The portions are large, the quality excellent, and the service fast and friendly. The line can get a bit long, but usually with a party of 2 the wait is no longer than 10 minutes. That being said, the wait feels fast I because the walls are covered in exotic chocolate and there is the little market in front with gourmet goods. I always enjoy browsing this section when we're with a bigger group and the wait is long.

In terms of best menu items: the latte bowl is a must! No weekend is complete without it. The hot chocolate is also extremely delicious. My favourite brunches are Brunch Sante and Atlantique, but my boyfriend swears by Le Cartet brunch. To be honest, you can't really go wrong here. I highly highly recommend it.
