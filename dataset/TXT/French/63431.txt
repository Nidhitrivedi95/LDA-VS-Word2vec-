So many courses I can't even. The ham in homemade donuts, the omelet covered in deep fried Parmesan cheese, the squid ink pasta with boudin, these were just a few of the memorable standouts. Our table, knowing this was likely a one-time thing for us, opted for the $70 additional tourtiere, which is a crazy thing to do, but was swoonworthy. After the first few courses we took smaller portions and started filling up the to-go containers which was the right move, because you need to leave room for dessert. 

The frozen maple yogurt was tart and amazing, the banana cake was dreamy, and the optional flaming maple absinthe was the perfect digestif. 

One hour out of town into the country, a $60 flat rate made this a very different experience from the downtown Au Pied de Cochon, less fancy and for me more fun and more worth experiencing. But I couldn't look at the leftovers the next day, my friends through them on the bbq and I had a salad. Very fun to experience, but likely just a one time thing for me.
