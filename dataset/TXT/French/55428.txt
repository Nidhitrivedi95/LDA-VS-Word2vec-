rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Bouchon baby, you rocked my world.  

Before going there, I already reviewed the menu, like, 10,000 times, drooling over the descriptions of its amazingly sounding dishes.  

And the date has finally arrived!  Hidden all the way on the 10th floor in the Venetian, getting to Bouchon was quite a trip.  The decor is reminiscent of a typical Parisian bistro/brasserie, dim light, long bar counter, and checkerboard tiles.

Perhaps my little note to the maitre d' through opentable.com actually worked (that it was my bf's birthday and we'd like to have some privacy), we were the only 2-person party sitting in the leather booth that night.  

And the dinner went on:
1.  Petite Plateau (1/2 lobster, 9 oysters, 3 shrimp, 3 clams, 6 mussels): Heavenly.  How can anyone not like this?  When the seafood platter is bigger than my face, I am definitely smiling.
2.  Apple and Celery Salad: Knowing that Bouchon was only the first stop for my Vegas gastronomic indulgence, i opted for the healthy special of the night.  What a simple concept, celery and apple--- yet what a refreshingly delicious combination.  Both the fruit and vegetable were shaved into thin strips, dressed in a perfectly balanced vinaigrette, with chestnuts to garnish.  It was the most refined health food I have ever had.
3. Duck Leg Confit: The French can do ducks, that's all I have to say.  Cripsy, rich duck flavors, sitting on a small side of beautifully sauteed mushrooms.  The mushrooms were woody and intensively flavorful--- so good that it was not just a B-rated sidekick to my duck leg, but a star-worthy cameo. 
4. Bone in Ribeye with Truffle Risotto: Both mah man and I agreed--- it was the first time we wanted the side just as much as we wanted the steak...  While the bone-in ribeye was so amazingly good, the side risotto absolutely blew our minds away!  

To polish off a wonderful dinner, our server was just as delightful.  Warm, funny, attentive, he was another 5 stars all by himself.
