X8lYvkI2Yv7f96cz4uE9LQ Christine and I had one of our best meals ever at Les Deux Singes de Montarvie on Weds. night, our final night in Montreal.  Our table had my name on it, indicating the care that each set of diners receives from an outstanding service staff.  The food, from amuse-bouche to dessert, was excellent -- artfully prepared, creative, beautiful to look at, and, of course, delicious.  I would have liked a bigger piece of sea bass, my main course in the Pescetarian tasting menu, but otherwise the portions were good and I left feeling very content.  Christine had the vegetarian tasting menu, which was outstanding as well.  We didn't opt for the reasonably priced wine flight ($30), but would definitely try it next time.  The wine by the glass selection is small but also reasonably priced and offers a good range of rouge and blanc.  Loved the background music and the whole vibe of the place, which is intimate but never crowded or loud.  It is the type of restaurant you feel good about choosing after scouring all the reviews and one you want to visit again as soon as possible (and once they change the tasting menu, about every 3-4 weeks).
Just go and enjoy!
