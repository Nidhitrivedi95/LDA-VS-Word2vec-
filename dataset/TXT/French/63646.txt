t1mR_Zff6Dqv1TueE2JLEA We totally enjoyed the meal, ambiance, and entertainment. We shared our meals so we could taste a little of everything.
The salad was tasty and fresh, and the dressing was not overpowering. The Chèvre brûlée and hummus were our second courses, and they were very tasty. We especially liked the chèvre brûlée and the jam that came with it. A very rich combination of sweet and salty. 
The braised Lamb meal was fabulous and the meat fell right off the bone. We also had the salmon, which was tasty as well, but I must say is was a tinge on the dry side.  That is a minor complaint, if you are a salmon fan - go for it!

The crime brûlée for dessert was good as was the carrot cake. The carrot cake is different than you would expect, slightly on the heavy side, still acceptable.

Go and enjoy!!!!
