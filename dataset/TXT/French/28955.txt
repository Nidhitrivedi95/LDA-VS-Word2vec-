Eoj4-cffvbIQxLTO-C_K0g A rare find in the City of Toronto. A place that actually got it right. Unfortunately it is only open for lunch, two hours a day.  Everything from food to service done to perfection.  I'm looking forward to experiencing more from this place. Unfortunately it will be closed for the summer. I had the seared salmon on greens with cherry tomatoes and the desert was a rhubarb tart with strawberries and ginger ice cream (not too sweet).
