RoGeo_pQ1TQc6Lyk4CSDgw Came to Table 51 for a quick lunch on a Friday. I had the steak salad and my husband had the reuben sandwich. His reuben sandwich was ...... no Schwartz sandwich but it was tasty though really really greasy. I am biased as I appreciate hearty sandwiches minus the grease. His accompanying kale salad was awesome! Generous portion of kale with slices of cheese drizzled with a vinegrette, it was above my expectations for a side. My steak salad was tasty as well, romaine leaves, I think there was swiss chard in there, fried onion rings, goat cheese, cherry tomatoes, the flavors were delicious. My only complaint is that they were a wee bit stingy on the steak portion. But I also had the same complaint with my baton rouge steak salad, maybe I should just order a whole steak next time :) Between the steak salad here vs the one at BR, I'd go for this one. We also had the lobster taco, it was delicious! Lobster filling with mayo and mint I'm guessing, lobster was fresh and pairs nicely with mint. Small portions but it's an appetizer. Prices are ..... high. But the atmosphere is nice, chic and hip. I guess that's partly what you're paying for. Service is fair. I want to give this place a 3.5 as I didn't find it super esp when you compare the price but there's no half measure.
