jfOyDJ-W4lV47Y61pPcMfQ Went there last night with my Parents.  Recommended by the concierge of the hotel we staying at.  Not in a touristy part of Montreal, but we were at the Botanical Gardens that was not far away.  I think we were the only tourist there.  I liked the restaurant a lot.  Service was good and the food was very good too.  I liked the way the menu was done, no meal would cost more than $40 a person for the full courses.  We had the scallops and foie gras for appentizer and they were great.  I had the Lapin (rabbit) was was good.  My Parents had the veal and cod which was good too.  Since this is a BYOB place, they do not sell any alcohol at all, so bring your own.

I do recommend this.  May be out of the way for tourist.  Seems to be a great neighbourhood restaurant.
