mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q Where to begin? Saying this restaurant is a dinner and a show is an understatement. Getting a seat at the bar is an absolute must!! Watching a kitchen work in perfect harmony is an absolute treat while you enjoy your meal. The people working in the kitchen are less chefs and more artists. The service was quick, but not so quick you felt rushed, and all of the members of the staff were extremely friendly and accommodating. The meal started with an amazing amuse Bouche, and that set the tone for how delicious the rest of the meal would be. The chef's special, the quail, words do not do it justice, and the sliders, do yourself a favor, just get them, you will LOVE them. For dessert I suggest the mango sorbet, it's like eating a mango flavored cloud, it is absolutely delicious.

I would also like to give a special shout out to our Matride, Paul, and our waiter Blair. They were without doubt two of the nicest, and most attentive restaurants employees we have ever met. They went above and beyond to make this arguably one of our best dining experiences of our life. If you are lucky enough to have either of them as your servers, I promise you that you will not forget him.

This was a truly wonderful dining experience and I am already excited to go again the next time I am in Vegas.
