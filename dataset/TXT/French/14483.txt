5EIuCcoHY2evAhFMBV6G6g I have never returned food back to the kitchen until now. 


Upon walking into the restaurant, there was a lot of empty tables and my reservation was at 6pm, it was sign #1 that  I should have never come.

My friends and I ordered the french onion soup, lobster bisque, chicken and foie gras with scallops. 

The french onion soup was okay, we all have had better french onion soup.

The lobster bisque... just wow, I have never tasted anything so salty in my life. It was so unbearable we had to send it back to the kitchen. And the tiny lobster piece in the middle of the dish was just sad and cold.

My friend was really unsatisfied with her chicken because it was really chewy, and so she sent that back to the kitchen as well. I didn't try a piece of it but honestly, how can you mess up on a chicken?!?

The foie gras with scallop was horrible. My foie gras was burnt and the scallops was undercooked; I can see my fork inside the transparent scallop. Only half of the dish was edible. What a waste of foie gras and scallop, they should be ashamed of themselves. My friend's foie gras was a little bit bloody too. Shame.

To make up for the disappointment, the restaurant offered us creme brulee... and it was horrible! "This is my favorite part!" as my friend proceeded to the crack the sugar layer with the back of her spoon but then it just bounced back. WTHECK. The sugar layer was so thick and burnt, and the custard inside was cold, forget this place. Don't come here. Even their "sorry, our food suck" dessert sucks.
