KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA We had a 5 course tasting menu while dining at Marche Bacchus. Our first course was a seared scallop with caviar on top and a micro green salad on the side. It was so sweet and delicately cooked to perfection. Our second course was a duck done 3 ways dish.  On top a very generous portion of foie gras that was crispy and so melt-in your mouth soft in the center. Third was the meat course, I'm a beginning eat meater for my filet was a little under done but to everyone else it was cooked well. Lastly they brought out an espresso cake with liquid chocolate ganash on the side to pour over it, it was perfection.

We found a couple of bottles of wine and that my partner said were very well priced to enjoy over dinner. Great selection of wine by the glass along with their bottles. The manager was very well knowledged and didn't pick out the most expensive bottle when we asked him for suggestions, but picked out bottles that best fit the description of the wine we wanted to purchase.

The wine shop offers *FREE* wine tasting on Saturday mornings from 1130-230.  It's never really crowed, but  a good way to get people interested in the restaurant and wine shop.

Can't wait to eat there again!
