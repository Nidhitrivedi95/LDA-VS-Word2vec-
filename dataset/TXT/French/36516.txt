i5vxtyiHKYnRcJ0p9N7mLw Was looking forward to trying this place, walked in 20 minutes before close and was refused service by extremely rude and abrasive staff stating that they were 'closed'. I understand coming in last minute- but 20 minutes? With the open sign still illuminated and everything? They need to treat their customer base more respectfully and learn how to pre-close in a way that they can still offer service! If you want to get out early at least lock the door and turn off the light so we don't have to deal with the nasty attitude. Very, very disappointed. 

Update: owner contacted me defending his restaurant and countered this review with a positive one, which sounded more like a cheap advertisement and could easily have been substituted for an SNL skit. Wouldn't even hear me out or offer a solution, just wanted to make sure he didn't lose business. Not the type of business model I'd like to support.
