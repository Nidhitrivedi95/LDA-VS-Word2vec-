kcF-en40P3J9L8nLy5lKqQ I went there for happy hour tonight with some coworkers and it was really great. I love how it's so airy and modern. I had the Mac n cheese and it was delicious. My coworkers had the pesto chicken pizza and the mushroom risotto and both thought they were great. We will definitely be coming back for another happy hour.
