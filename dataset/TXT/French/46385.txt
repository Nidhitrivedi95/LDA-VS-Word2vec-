Ncvd4l3zo72FUK5kovQhYQ What a huge disappointment this place is.  The only thing "French" about this place is a lot of pictures of the Eiffel Tower. We went there for breakfast and got two different omelets. The omelets were bland and uninspired. I got the side of roasted potatoes. They were made with that gross processed garlic in a jar, and judging that they were nuclear hot inside and cold outside they microwave them to heat them up. Wifey got a side of baked apples which were good, but its pretty tough to mess that one up.  It's a sad day when I regretted not going to eat n park.
