4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Been here twice. This review is for my latest visit. It was not good. First of all my burger was pretty dry and the vegetables looked like it was pre packed the night before under a blow dryer. Second, how do you make a caesar salad taste bad? After telling the waiter that it was disgusting and we did not want it nor a replacement he complied and removed it from our bill. When the bill arrived all the items totaled up were completely off. They tried overcharging us by at least $9. I pointed this out and after about 15 minutes of waiting they came up with the story their computers were messing up? Really? C'mon get your act straight. This was a must go restaurant for me to go to every vegas trip, But Id rather settle for in n out now
