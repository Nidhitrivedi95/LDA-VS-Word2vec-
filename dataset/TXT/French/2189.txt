0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g Where else can you dine. wine, AND take photos of Picasso paintings?  While I am a lover of all kinds of food, from hole in the wall $1/meal stands in Asia to Michelin star restaurants, I can't say that I am an expert in critquing courses of this caliber.  

Two months ago was my second time dining here.  The first was when I was a mere teenager and unaware of degustation menus.  Now as a proclaimed foodie, I'll have to say that this restaurant made me loovee foie gras, pigeon, 30 year old dessert wine, and fine dining even more!

If anything, sitting feet away from the Bellagio fountain and Picasso paintings make the $200/person meal almost worth it!  Sorry that I am not more descriptive of the food but I sure am a sucker for the ambience.  The highlight was being able to take photos of Picassos!  No museum in the world would allow you to do that with flash...
