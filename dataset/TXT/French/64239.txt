tCSlpwJQ4CZsUEMZeH2SFg We went for our first time this weekend and loved it! It was a rainy Saturday so the "french bistro" atmosphere seemed perfect. We got a table quick and had a very attentive server who gave us the full rundown of the best items on the menu. 
Outside of the cute set up - the food was amazing! Zero exaggeration - the best French Onion soup I've tasted to date, and that's saying a lot. My bf had the french dip sandwich and it was perfectly cooked in every way. Hot with melted cheese and just the right amount of au jus. I had the banana flambe nutella crepes and they were excellent. They also had great looking pastries and every kind of coffee you could think of. Overall, great place with great service and great food. Will definitely be back!
