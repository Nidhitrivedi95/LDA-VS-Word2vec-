mnn--vaYHtNyBNYFYBFIog Hosted a large client/prospect luncheon here last week.  The food was amazing.  Squab liver pate plate surpised all with the clever use of apple and lamb shoulder melted in my mouth.  The only reason I took away a star is because of the wine offering and the handling of the questioning of the wine with the sommelier.  Simple questions about the choice of table wine with the use of unfiltered gamay turned into a challenge of my wine knowledge.  Fortunate enough to have had most wines of the world, but found this selection fell way short of the caliber of the meal.  Check the attitude in the future and offer an alternative the first time I ask.
