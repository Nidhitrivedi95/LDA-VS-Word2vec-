uP3H5bcsiTXM0k0xQhRndg We came here for dinner on a weeknight. We only waited about 10 minutes cause it was only the 2 of us. A party of four behind us were told their wait would be about 40 minutes, so I guess you should take into account the wait time when going to this restaurant. So... onto the food. We shared the beet salad, which was average. We ordered the mac and cheese and the pizza. Both were really good. The portion size for the mac and cheese was huge. We could not finish it so we took the rest home. The service was really good. They were prompt and always ready with the water. It had a lively atmosphere. The only weird thing was a large tv screen that was showing a sunset and then a campfire throughout the evening. It was such a random decor.
