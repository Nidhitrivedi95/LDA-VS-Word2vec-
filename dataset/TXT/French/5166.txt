3FlWR_osNPb8dcqLgHebHw I have to say I didn't miss coming here. As you walk in the hostess doesn't even greet or smile at you but wait for you to approach them. We asked to be seated outside and we followed her but she just stood there and stared at us. So, we supposed to guess if she'll sit us or we sit ourselves? We sat down and waited for a server but the table next to us that came after us got served first. Food is cold and my guess is that it's been sitting for awhile under the heat lamp. All in all service here is awful.
