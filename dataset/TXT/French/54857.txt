But the fact that I called yesterday to make reservations SPECIFICALLY for a table at their patio, and was assured I would have one -- and then learn upon arrival that their patio is closed -- definitely doesn't put me in the mood to spend my money there or to recommend it to anyone.  Not to mention that the weather was perfect, and all around it people were enjoying food and drinks on the patios -- why would they even close the patio?  But -- why not tell me that upfront rather than acquire an angry misled customer?  Beats me.
