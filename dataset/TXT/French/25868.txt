Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA I travel to Vegas for work a lot, and this is by far, my favorite bar on the strip!  It's never too crowded, the drinks are awesome, and the views... breathtaking!  I esp like the bathrooms... how often are you happy to sit in a stall, doing your business with a full wall of windows overlooking the skyline right in front of you???
