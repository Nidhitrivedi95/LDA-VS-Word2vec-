AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw Due to rough scheduling, I went off on my own to find something quick to eat while staying at Caesar's. I just wanted a simple snack that didn't put a dent in my pocket or take up too much stomach space, so I opted for something hopefully reasonable at Payard, which is well known for their lavish desserts and chocolates. After having a mental breakdown at their standard-sized $9 crepes, I opted for a sandwich, which was terrible and cost me $10. I figured it would be something simple and filling (not to mention edible), but it turned out to be a cold, pre-premade sandwich with sad peices of iceberg lettuce and a desperate splash of Italian dressing. I'm ashamed to say that I threw most of it away, for fear of food poisoning. Maybe another time for one of their desserts.
