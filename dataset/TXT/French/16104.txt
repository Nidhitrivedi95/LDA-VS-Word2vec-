78TC3sZSYBzBsSJ0z5pyhw Met out of town family for dinner.

We ordered 
French Fries (which had to be sent back, it was the one item that was requested to be crispy "standing at attention crispy and hot")
Calamari (good, but did not come with normal lemon or cocktail sauce)
Fish (good)
Prime Rib (very good)
Shrimp Scampi (terrible very salty and cold)
Cheese Cake (which crumbled each time you put a fork to it, never seen  
that before)
Creme Brulee (good)

It was pretty empty (6:30pm on Thurs), we had some very specific request and the waiter was visible frustrated when one item was sent back.   I really wanted to send back my plate, it was over loaded with salt but the it was not worth the waiters response.  When we ordered dessert and coffee it took forever to come.  Will never go back too many place to eat in this town.
