rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w An experience through and through!  I love feeling like you disappeared into a different world, especially when you walk thorough a casino to get there.  Our first stop in this over-the-top, circus theme decorated restaurant, was the beautiful semi-circle bar with the inviting striped high chairs.  We ordered and enjoyed our drinks while waiting for our table to be prepared. Once ready, we were whisked away to our table in the intimate dining room with the circus tent above.  Since our dinner here was a few months ago during summer, I can't/won't go into detail on the dishes we had.  But I can tell you that we both ordered the LeCirque Tasting menu, and enjoyed just about every dish that came our way.  We did the wine pairing as well, and the wines were exceptional.  The sommelier provided stories, laughter, and a good education on the wines that were served.  Depending on your table location, you may also have a nice view of the Bellagio fountains through the restaurant windows. We loved the experience, it was just fun.  And I like when a fine dining experience can be fun and not just stuffy.
