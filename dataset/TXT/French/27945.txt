dW9cPsvOGwlOpiz3wEBgiQ Had dinner here this evening. This was our first time here. Even though we  are locals, we have never eaten here until this evening. What a pleasant experience. The wait staff are all so friendly. We were seated immediately. Started out with the Onion soup. I must say, this was the best onion soup I have had in years!   I ordered the petite filet trio. It was perfectly prepared. So tender, and still hot when  it was placed on the table. Very flavorful.  Waitstaff checked on us often, our glasses were never empty.  Dirty plates were removed quickly.   We were treated like VIP's, from the time we walked in the door, until we left.  I will  definitely be back! If you are looking for a pleasurable dining experience, give this place a try!
