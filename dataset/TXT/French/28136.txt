E9HkUYYO_-5vKjvBwLuDIw On the way out from starbucks with an empty stomach, you glance at the menu on the glass wal from the french restaurant next door. On the background, there's an aesthetic chandelier upon the bar and variety of wines on the container. There are people-mostly couples- with smiles on their face, like they just got engaged near the Eiffel tower shines its bright and romantic beams. You enter the restaurant and the dark, private atmosphere surrounds you. Trying to pronounce the french menu just makes you cringe a little. As an American, skipping the small talk and going straight to entrees is a norm and proud of it very much. Bavette à L'echalotte's medium steak with the scent of red wine enlightens your tongue like a french revolution. There's no extraordinary experience as this you can find in Summerlin. Later in life, you find yourself counting on here as a special dinner place, an exclamation point!, for your next important dates. Memorable places filled with memorable taste stay within the core memory of your relationships with people that you had dinner together here.
