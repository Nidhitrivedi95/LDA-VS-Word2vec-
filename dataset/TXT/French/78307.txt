YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g Great Caesar salad with white anchovies.  Ahi tacos were fresh and delicious. Soups are good and fresh, we love coming here, Hubert's restaurants are the best...one complaint...veggie burgers are not house-made...looks like Boca burgers...please develop something that is to the Hubert and my standards next time
