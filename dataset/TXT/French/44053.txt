MdjIl105vqCYUGKFSUVytA I went to Colette for lunch last week on a weekday. 

My friend and I loved the decor, very french and feminine. We also really enjoyed the food. 

The buffet had shrimp, a variety of sandwiches and wraps and salads as well as cured meats and cheese. For around $25 (all you can eat) this is a great deal!

I had the shrimp cocktail, which is not such a great deal as it is the same shrimp as the buffet and was like $16. But my club sandwich was PHENOMENAL. There was the usual chicken bacon and cheese but there was also a tomato sauce so it was like a cross between pizza and a club sandwich and it really worked. 

The service was a bit on the slow side. It took the servers a while to refill our water and take our order. 

There are beautiful looking pastries in the adjacent bakery. We didn't have any, but I'm sure they're delicious. 

I will definitely return to Colette.
