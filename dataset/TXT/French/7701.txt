4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I came here for Easter Sunday brunch and it was nice, the food was yummy. My friend got the seafood crepe and I got the beef bourge bene which was so yummy and tasty. 
Our server Cheryl was really nice but geez the staff at the hostess stand had a snappy attitude. Overall a good experience. If you intend to sit at the patio you have to join the waitlist they don't take reservations for that area. Best to make a reservation if you just want to try the food anyway.
