Yp9w4nhUowBU_IS_StFXbQ F A N C Y!!!!!  Want to impress someone or maybe spoil yourself?  Then this is the place to go!  Make sure you ask for a purse cart so everyone in the restaurant can be in awe of it!  I have no problem paying a lot for a meal as long as it is worthy of it's price tag and this place definitely is worthy!  I had 4 kids in tow and they were happy to share two orders of the banana pancakes ($17 per order of 3 pancakes) and the staff had already split them up onto 4 plates before delivering them to the table.  The service was impeccable!  My very favorite moment of this experience was when 5 waiters/waitresses brought out all of our meals at the same time.  Perfection!
