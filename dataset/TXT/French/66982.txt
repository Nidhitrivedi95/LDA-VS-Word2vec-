USleI8g1UVN9-9jm-b4uIg My sons 10th birthday wish, since he wants to be a chef, was to go to some fancy restaurant that has an involved menu. SO we went to the Fig Tree. Although pricey it met all our expectations. The staff was SUPER. They were very attentive and helpful and answered all my sons numerous inquiries. The food was absolutely great. We had all the odd dishes too: Octopus, Fois Gras, Elk, and Ostrich. The ambience of the old house is also very nice and we find it especially neat that it is named teh Lucas house because that is our last name.
