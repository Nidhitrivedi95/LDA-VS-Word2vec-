I have been to enough michelin-rated places to come to expect a minimum level of service. Daniel Boulud did not come close. At first we thought it was our waiter or just our table. But the more noticeable things became, the more we noticed that other tables had similar issues. Several of our drink orders were forgotten and had to be requested for a third time. The table next to us with a different waiter had the same issue with another glass of wine. Half of their table was sharing a bottle, and they were refilling glasses themselves as no staff was around. The food servers did not know the order of the plates. You would think that they would be good enough to rotate one place once the first plate was wrong. But nope, they couldn't do that since the plates weren't brought out in order anyway. Went something like seat 1, then 4, then 3 and back to 2. Ridiculous. No simultaneous plating. Another table was sharing the steak for 2, and it wasn't cooked to their request. My water glass remained empty for half the meal and I had to request a refill. Then the server comes back and starts to refill my wine glass with water. And makes a joke that it's the third time it's happened that day. Maybe it wasn't and he was just being funny, but by the way the service was up to that point, I'm pretty sure he was serious. 

If this were a lesser establishment, maybe I wouldn't expect near perfect service. But if you receive a michelin star and promote yourself as a fine establishment, your staff should at least be competent.
