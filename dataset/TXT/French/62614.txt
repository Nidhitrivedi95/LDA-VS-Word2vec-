SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ Love House of Tricks.   Been here many times for lunch.  Took some out of town guests here for dinner.  As usual, they did not disappoint.   We started with drinks,  I had the Lavender Dog, so good.  It was so good others ordered one after they finished their first drink.( Would love to have the recipe).  I ordered the Pork Chop very tender,  full of flavor  and the bitter brussel sprout leaves were a great counter balance to the sweet tart chutney.  One person got the Mahi Mahi,  she loved it.  The other at the table got the Filets and again they all enjoyed it very much.  We ended the night with night caps,  I got the Toasted....excellent.  Thank you House of Tricks for always making meals so wonderful.
