YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g Came here before goin to Lights in Mandalay Bay and utilized a $50 Restaurants.com gift certificale (Totally Worth it, because if we had to pay full price, this review would be a lot lower)

That being said, the food was fine, nothing really blew us a way. We tried the Burger, Fried Trufffle Mac and Cheese, the Filet Mignon and Foie Gras. All were standard and not really worth much hype.

We even got a free dessert which was nice, it was a chocolate pudding thing with passion fruit on top but the thing was, the passion fruit on top was DISGUSTING. Who thought it was a good idea to pair those two because it was TERRIBLE. They should just QUIT AND GO HOME. Because it was TERRIBLE.

That being said, the bread was good even though it cost AN ADDITIONAL CHARGE AND..BTW...TAKES 30-40 MINUTES TO COME OUT. We got the bread after we got our food. Who does that?

In any case, will probably not revisit. TOTALLY NOT WORTH THE HYPE.
