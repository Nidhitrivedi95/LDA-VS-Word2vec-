w2tr0PA0b3tg8pId0kjM-A Perfect for gifts of treating yourself once in awhile! Everything there is made with so much care and it shows in the quality of the pastries! I've only tried a handful of the macaron flavors but all have been great and tasty so far. The white chocolate basil is my favorite, with the rose at a close second :) They typically also have a monthly flavor that is fun and new. The small pastries and cakes they offer are also beautifully decorated and extremely tasty. Got a white chocolate pear cake for my birthday a few months back and I almost felt bad digging in because of how perfect it looked! 

One of the best things is taking someone from out of town here for the first time and seeing their face light up with the "wow" factor as soon as they walk in. Also gives me an excuse to splurge on a big box of macarons!
