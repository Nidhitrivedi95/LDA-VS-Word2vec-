came here for my birthday dinner. hostess was very rude, told us if we wanted to sit at this other table it would take 15 min wait, at the door, when we saw another waitress clean up that table in 2 minutes. My friend was bothered by how the hostess was so rude to me, that she talked to the manager, and they agreed to move us to another table. Reserved hours in advance with a note saying that it was my birthday, and waiter didn't bother to ask me about what they offered for birthdays. Everytime we had a inquiry or request, it would take the waiter 20 min to get to us, and it was not even busy, given it was a wednesday night. Ordered medium rare steak with my friend, turns out they mixed up our order with another table, and then had to wait another 20 minutes to get our actual order. Didn't bother to bring us a steak knife even though we ordered a steak. Steak was burnt as well, and had a funky smell to it. FINALLY, asked the waiter for dessert options for Birthday, and he proceeds to ask "well what do you want?" How am i supposed to know what you guys offer, as he did not offer me a dessert menu. After he gives us the cream puff, bc thats what he recommended, he did not proceed to tell me there is hazelnut in there, which i was allergic to. I should have mentioned that I had nut allergy, however he did not provide any ingredients or ask me in the beginning. A  1 hour dinner turned into a 3 hour dinner with bad service. Wouldn't recommend this place.
