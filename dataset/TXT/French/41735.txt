KNBHGY4rQVuoHxZf_6ANuw I had a lovely stay here; nice spacious corner room on the club lounge level.  Quiet, great view, and large bathroom.  I missed the usual Intercontinental slippers though!  Bathrobe was there!  It is borderline dated, but very clean. 

I found the front desk staff to be really friendly.  But, my favorite people were the Club Lounge staff.  Franco, Rick, and there was a woman that worked a few mornings were outstanding.  They also provide room service, and so they are constantly running around.  I'm not sure why such a nice hotel is so short on staff, but you need to give these people a break.  They should be attending to the lounge and all the people sneaking in.  Which, is a big problem.  The lounge is located just off the lobby, and many non-paying guests were helping themselves; just easily sneaking into it when the doors opened.  It needs to be more closely monitored.  Some guests took advantage of the space and the food.  It was a little disturbing.  

I did not love the bar in the hotel.  Service was friendly, but not that great.  And the food was not good at all.  

Location is great.  Very close to old town, and for me, within walking distance of the great shopping and museums (if you don't want to walk, you can Uber it for less than $10 to just about all the sites in town).
