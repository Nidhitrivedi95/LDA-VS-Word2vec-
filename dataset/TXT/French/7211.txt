4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw We came here for breakfast around 9 am on a Saturday. We were seated within minutes and was able to order our food in a few minutes as well. The service was excellent despite the fact that it was a full house.

We ordered a Ham, Egg, and Cheese Crepe and the Blueberry Waffles. The Blueberry Waffles were amazing. They are served as a plate miniature waffles topped with fresh cooked blueberries and a whipped cream sauce. The waffles were buttery crispy and warm and fluffy internally.

The crepe was soft and hot served. The sauce that comes with the crepe is great! They really know how to pair foods with sauces at this restaurant. I would come here for breakfast every morning if I was staying at Paris.

If you want to sit outside with a view of the strip, I would recommend making a reservation, because that part of the restaurant was full. It also looks like a nice setting to enjoy some waffles and a glass of mimosa!
