4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw over 3000 reviews and a full 4 stars.  i was expecting good.  what i got was borderline mediocre and whatevs.  it started with our server who was more interested in the table of middle aged women next to ours decked out in gucchi from head to toe.  straight up housewives of las vegas status.  whatevers, i'm not hating on the women, as much as i am on our server.

he came to our table, introduced himself and said he'd be right back to tell us about the specials.  he did not return for another 10-15 minutes.  strike 1.

we ordered a variety of items.  i got the chicken and apples sandwich which was delicious.  the fries on the other hand.  meh.  

corn beef hash - he said the eggs would come out poached.  they did not.  it was fried.

full order of mussels.  i found it a little fishy, but gf's said it was good. 

salmon salad.  what a sad, sad salad.

it took us about 20 minutes to get our check even after we had finished our meal because our server was busy talking to the ladies and showing old photos from when he was young.  he then proceeded to go to a new table, use the same line he used on us, and then walked away even after seeing we were done.

i think we were visibly annoyed, but if he caught on he showed no signs.  just went right back to chit chatting with everyone else.  first time ever where i have only tipped 10% on a meal.
