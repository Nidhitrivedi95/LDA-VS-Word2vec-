ZdaZwXC0FByDY3EwNELphw Probably more like a 3.5 to 3.75. I had the sticky ribs. They come on a bed of black kale with carrots on the side and caramelized tomato/bbq onions on top, and the ribs were delicious, but honestly, what I'm thinking about the day after are the carrots. They were prepared simply, just with butter and salt, but I couldn't stop eating them. My friend had the whitefish and holy hell, it was good, as were the baby shiitakes he got on the side. (So good he got a side order of mushrooms, though they weren't as good as the mushrooms that appeared on his original plate.) As is my wont, I got the grapefruit cocktail. It was kind of cloying and a little bitter, but what else do you expect from a cocktail with Campari in it?  

Atmosphere was really nice. It's cool and quite beautiful in there, and service was friendly though it took a while to get our bill (it was Friday night and busy).

Two mains, a side, two cocktails and a beer got us to $110 before tip. Cocktails here are expensive, about $15 each, but that seems to be a new normal.

I'd probably go back.
