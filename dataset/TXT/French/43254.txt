lsfPvV4iZop_rA3PUZeZJA We went to this restaurant during MTL a Table and I have to say, I'm a big fan of the decor! It feels like a cosy log cabin, which is perfect for cold November evenings. 

Their cocktails are original (and have the best names), but there's unfortunately not a very extensive choice of beer. I found it odd that a restaurant priding itself on featuring Quebec delicacies would not have more local microbrewery beers on the menu (especially considering Dieu du Ciel is not far away).
Seal tataki was cooked perfectly (just raw enough), but poorly seasoned and poorly trimmed. I had a huge slice of 100% seal fat. In contrast, the trout was very good; loved the multicolored veggies accompanying it, it was simple and efficient! 
The brownie was (of course) to die for, a perfect way to finish the meal. However, I think the best surprise was the nougat! I could've ordered a second one, it was delicious! 

Good choice for a casual night!
