x1bjSvpIJTN1KBFhUjOU_g Food was amazing. I've been here three times now. 

The restaurant brings out a lettuce salad with a mustard dressing, and olives with bread to start. I've ordered the steak tartare as my main each time, as this is the best I've ever had.  

The only issue is space. This time I was tucked away into a tiny corner surrounded by other tables. I could barely walk through the tables to exit without hitting someone with my purse.
