58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw I really liked this spot - it reminded me of a modern café in the financial districts of San Francisco or New York - modern and a bit minimalist with tall ceilings and a somewhat industrial look.

We were here for brunch and I thought it was excellent - I had eggs with goat cheese and while it sounds simple, it was such great quality and cooked so well, that it was something special.  We also had some good hot chocolate.  

There is a section of prepared food and everything looked great - we took home some pastries and everything was very good.
