ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug We went to this cafe for lunch, I have got to tell you the food is AMAZING! I got the turkey on a croissant roll with chicken noodle soup and it was to die for! 
The staff is a bit slow (Took us 20 minuets to get the check) but the food makes up for them, IF your in las Vegas go to this restaurant!
