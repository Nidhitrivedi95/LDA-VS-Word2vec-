4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw More like 3.5. Here's why:

4 stars for St. Germaine spritz:  Worth it if splitting between friends. Light and sweet, simply delicious.
3 stars for frangria: a little too bitter and not as tasty as I anticipated.
4 stars for onion soup (a must) and escargot (garlicky goodness)
3 stars for classique steak frites: overcooked, overpriced, pretty bland.  A couple gfs got the burger and steak sandwich and thought the burgers were ok and steak sandwich was good.  
4 stars for service: I believe his name is either Noah or Gary from NY. Tall, middle aged man with great conversation, charm, and service. 

Ambiance was nice and quiet.  Perfect after a night of partying or to get away from all the Vegas noise.  I'll be back...
