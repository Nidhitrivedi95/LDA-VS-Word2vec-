KBSCJcWGk9QNPX9MTSlM3Q 7.50$ for an awesome eggs benny and 3$ caesars and mimosas. The hollandaise here isn't the thick, congealed stuff you get at a lot of brunch places. It's light and doesn't smother the eggs. Eggs were poached perfectly (in my opinion), with not too much runny yolk.

The 3$ ceasar had a house-pickled asparagus spear, yum.

I've also been for their 10$ burger & beer special, which I enjoy. The fries are top drawer.

Also, one of the very few places in the city with Left Field on tap.

Service can be a little slow, as there's usually only one person working the bar, serving and bussing, but I've had longer waits and at least you don't feel rushed! I can't believe this place isn't busy all the time.
