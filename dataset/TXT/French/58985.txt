rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w Way way over-priced

The meal itself is good, but I could find similar dishes in LA or SF with a much more reasonable price, under $100.

I like their monkey plate, very cute. Uni is awesome, foi gras is awesome, presentation is awesome. Don't try cocktail. Meat were cooked too rich.
