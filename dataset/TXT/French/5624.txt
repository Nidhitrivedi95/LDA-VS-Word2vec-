They had amazing appetizers-- salmon tartare I believe and the best desert samplers.   I loved the lemon tarts. They were zingy tasting.  And  the chocolate desert was to die for.   I met many interesting Yelpers and I was proud to tell the Montrealer all about our organization  Friends for Mental Health.  I am planning to go there for dinner some time soon.
