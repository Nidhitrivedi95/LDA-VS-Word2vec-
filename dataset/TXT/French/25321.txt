Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA I went to mix restaurant this past weekend. My girlfriend and I had a great experience. The restaurant is located at the very top of The Hotel at Manadalay Bay. The entire restaurant is white. When I first walked in I was initially disappointed in the view. I had expected a lot more, but as the day turned to night, the view was actually pretty nice. The food was VERY good. We ended up order the chef's tasting menu. Our meal started of with a lobster salad....yummy. We then had buttered Cod, followed by a exceptionally soft tenderloin. The chef was kind enough to replace the duck dish with the beef tenderloin, because we did not feel like duck. My overall experience was great. You can never go wrong at a restaurant that has a Michelin Star.  Also, the environment didn't seem at pretentious as other upscale restaurants I have eaten in.
