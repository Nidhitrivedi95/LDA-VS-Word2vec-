4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw My fiancé and I came here for brunch based on a friends recommendation. The food was delicious, service is excellent, and the views are nice. I got the smoked salmon eggs Benedict and my fiancé got the turkey and cheese omelette. My plate was delicious but my fiancé didn't care too much for his omelette. 

Only tiny complaint is the glasses are really dusty and I'm just drinking grapefruit juice and dust but I didn't want to complain over something so minimal. 

Overall, it's a good restaurant to try out.
