It was quite crowded on a Monday night, and while there were mostly elderly people, I found the place great for a quiet evening with good service and food. Excellent service - attentive without being obtrusive. Food - we all enjoyed the dishes wed had ordered and the deserts were fantastic too. The spiced lamb sausage dish was good as was the pasta with pesto. The wine selection was good. We wanted a rose wine, and while it wasn't on the menu, they had a couple of bottles tucked away, which were great. Fine dining without the hefty pricetag, and not very hoity-toity. The only reason for the four stars is the size of the portions - they were a little small for the young men in our group.
