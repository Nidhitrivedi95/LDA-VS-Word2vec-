8ciT6qjI18x9EPtOb-gqYQ My husband and I decided to book this restaurant for our 5 year anniversary.  We had an amazing night with the service, the staff and especially the food!  We could not stop raving how amazing the fish and chicken dishes were.  And the tart for dessert was even personalized for our anniversary.  So worth every penny and more!
