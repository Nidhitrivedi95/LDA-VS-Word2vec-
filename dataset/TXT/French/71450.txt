xcmmTXhuMx2fZF2Bt69F4w Was visiting family in Pittsburgh and came here for lunch with the girls. What a quaint little corner Cafe. The decor was spectacular and the service was fabulous. We enjoyed some Frites, Salad, Mussels and the Monte Cristo. Each plate was delicious. Looking forward to returning upon my next visit back to Pittsburgh.
