The server is not very attentive but i think that it is good in a way since, I would like to apend time enjoying the atmosphere and the nice view of the Bellagio's fountain.  I ordered a cream of corn soup, which is really good.  Got the duck breast as the main entry and that didn't disappoint me either.  Overall, great atmosphere and great food for fine dining.
