_eNeiqWPt1MPLFF6DEIJeA Roxu is one of my favorite spots!  I've visited on many occasions, usually order something different, and have loved everything I've tried! The ambiance is very chill, some people are dressy, some are super casual, and I like that I can drop in and usually be seated very quickly. I love the chalkboard tabletops, it's fun to doodle and draw as I eagerly await my steam buns! haha! The staff is always personable and well-informed on the menu and are able to answer my questions. Chef Rob has truly found his calling, as his creative and delicious concoctions are so pleasing to all the senses with amazing flavors and beautiful and fun presentation. Whether you want something rich and indulgent, or lighter yet satisfying, seafood lover, meat, or vegetarian alike, there is something for everyone, and plenty of options! Roxu offers great happy hour specials, daily food specials, once a month or so prix fixe menus with cocktail pairings with a fun theme and sometimes live entertainment,, and Wednesday sushi night!
