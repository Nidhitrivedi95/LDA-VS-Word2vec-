4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Never disappointing. Best roast chicken, cooked just right. Love their bread and that special spread served with it. Lovely décor. Service has always been excellent. This is a great place for first dates, family dinners, and special occasions. Reservations are recommended to avoid a long wait. This is my oldest son's favorite restaurant (he's 23, with an exceptional palate).
