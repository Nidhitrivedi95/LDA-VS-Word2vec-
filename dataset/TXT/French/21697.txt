Bf-yMQiSmDZyqfGyFKQ0bA Service wasn't very good, and I honestly don't expect much at tables in a bar.  Friendly, but slow service (because inefficient, not because he wasn't around much).  Forgot drink order and waited 30 minutes total before getting a beer, even though the place was barely half-full when we got there.

This is a bar, the food we had was quite unremarkable.  Turkey Rueben at $10 should be high quality meat, high quality bread, etc.  It was el-cheapo thin rye bread from the grocery store, dry bland turkey and cheap dressing on top.  This was a $4 version.  I order this sandwich (or the original version of it) many places so I'm no stranger to it.

Cool atmosphere, good beer selection, good vibe.  Go for the beer, skip the food.
