SCklYa_jhihWAcfIn-_chg I've been meaning to have a meal at Bonjour Brioche for many many months and finally had the opportunity this past weekend after participating in the 50km ride for heart charity bike ride. After waiting 20+ minutes in line to get seated (normal for a well hyped brunch spot in leslieville on a weekend afternoon), we immediately ordered drinks and an appetizer so we can munch on something as we decide. Very shortly after we received two iced lattes with Bailey's and a butter croissant with jam. Delicious. Once they brought these, we ordered two specials. One was a bonjour benny with salmon and the other was a brioche. 

This is where the experience gets very sour. We had to wait 1hr17m to get our COLD meals. In this time, parties to the left and right of us had been seated, fed, and checked out twice over. But not us. We repeatedly had asked our waiter on the status and he assured us the kitchen was busy and it's coming. 

It safe to say that I will not be going back to my local breakfast spot and I will preach the terrible service they have.
