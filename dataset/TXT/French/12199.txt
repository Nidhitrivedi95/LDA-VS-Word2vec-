4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw When in front of restaurant, we are reluctant to enter because sign show us they are French stake restaurant. Lately we are eating stake a lot. But French word make us try to eat.

There are some delicious seafood!! And taste so good!!! In addition to it, they have good mood!! 

I recommend Asian people because size of dish is small compared with another restaurant, but it is enough to share with 2 people.

I like oyster, sermon, and shrimp cocktail.
120$ /2 person with above dishes and 4 grass of alcohol.
