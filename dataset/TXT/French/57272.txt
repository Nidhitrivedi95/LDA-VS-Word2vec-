rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A If you've been to the one in Yountville, this one is definitely worth going to. 

I didn't like it the first time I went, but definitely this time I enjoyed everything. The highlight, for me, was that I could get foie gras here, which I can't do back home (stupid CA laws!). One thing to watch out for: it's VERY hard to get reservations during large events like CES, which is when I was there last. Get yours ahead of time or expect to eat dinner after 9pm.
