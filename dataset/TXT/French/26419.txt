Everything a true food enthusiast can ask for- the food is innovative, yet still real; healthy and delicious. I have a football-player appetite so I ordered the kale salad which was fresh and bright, the venison tartar French style- perfection!, and the venison sausage with some kind of slaw perhaps- a perfect dynamically contrasted masterpiece!  I can only hope for the opportunity to return, soon!
