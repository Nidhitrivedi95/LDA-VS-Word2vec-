oPGUbqBpHNZvVu9gAFJbMQ We were a group of 6 and were guided through the menu by our waiter who was not always the most attentive. They apparently had ran out of clean cutlery when I asked for another fork!  
Food quality was great very fresh.
Some of the info on portions was way off and my husband had to order another entree... but in all the food was good.
Nothing exceptional, simply put standard fare for the price.
