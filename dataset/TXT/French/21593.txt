bEVWHtBRYVwqaaNF4mWNYg I've been to Coquine many times and I've never had a bad meal here. The service is excellent and it's always nice to dine in a friendly place where the owner and staff remember you. 

Everything on the menu is amazing, especially the chicken, salmon and croquettes, and steak frites. The roast Brussels sprouts are worth the visit alone!

And for the gluten-free people out there, they have a flourless chocolate torte that is simply to die for. All around, a great casual dining spot deserving of its reputation.
