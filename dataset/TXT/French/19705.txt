aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw I was staying at the Palazzo and i saw on yelp there was a highly rated bakery next door at the Venetian.  This location is right outside of the Grand Luxe cafe in the Venetian.  

I ordered the Vanilla Macaron, Almond Croissant, and Blueberry Muffin.  The macaron was really big and really bad.  It was cold, chewy, and i felt like i was eating something that sat in the refrigerator for a week.  I took one bite and threw it in the trash.  I eat Macarons all over the United States, and a normal macaron is room temp, not chewy, and usually has a nice soft texture to it.  Avoid this Macaron at all costs. 

On a better note, the Almond Croissant was and Blueberry Muffin were both OK, but nothing to write home about.
