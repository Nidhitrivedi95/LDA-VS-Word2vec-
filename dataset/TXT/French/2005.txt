The croissant are all very good - the plain and the Jocelyn (maple and raisin) are my go-to-girls. I try not to think of how much butter was sacrificed for the cause. The pain perdu, which is the French toast, made with egg bread and topped with creme anglaise is sinful. The croque monsieur is satisfying as well. 

There tends to be a crowded jumble of takeout and eat-in customers on weekends who inevitably need to pay all the same time in the tiny space which means I stand at the counter wistfully trying to catch the eye of someone behind the counter while all four staff bustle around getting orders for the sit down customers wow this sentence is a crowded jumble.  

Depending on the croissant style, four of them will set you back about $9.  Yes, you can get cheap croissant by the clamshell at your local grocery store but you won't want to call them croissant once you have Pain Perdu.
