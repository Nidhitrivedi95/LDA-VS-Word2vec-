YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g We originally had a reservation for 12 but only 10of our guests would attend dinner so we decided to change the amount using the open table system. Upon arriving to the restaurant no reservation could be found. It wasn't long until we realized that the date had been changed when we changed the amount of guests. This could have been terrible, however, it wasn't. The hostesses, and manager worked together to put something together and they did! We were seated on time, the food was delicious and the presentation was beautiful. We had tickets to a show afterwards, which we made on time, thanks to this great team. I'd definitely recommend this place.  Be sure to order the oysters!
