hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA I am a fan of the pressed panini. To me, it's a bit pricy for an every day lunch spot but the portions are good and salad is great. Also amazing illy coffee.   They also have an outside seating.  The owner is very personable and staff are really friendly so it make it even more enjoyable lunch time.

Note: Get there early if you do not want to wait on the long line! It's worth the wait but if you have limited time to grab a bite get there early or order by phone before heading over.
