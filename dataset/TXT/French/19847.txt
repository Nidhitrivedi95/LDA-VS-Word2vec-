aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw The raspberry macaroons are the REAL reason I go to Las Vegas every year.

(OK, my boss pays for the trip under the pretense of sending me to the Consumer Electronics Show- but he's really just making an effort to keep me on staff by paying for me to get my Bouchon macaroon fix.)

It's a little bakery stand in The Venetian.  You'll find a couple of locations scattered around.  There are two (one upstairs, one downstairs) up on the north end where there's a raised walkway across the strip to TI & Mirage.  I tend to go to the upstairs one, as it's on my walk over to the Expo center, and the CES shuttle busses to the LVCC.

I've seen a few walk-in closets bigger than the stand I frequent- but as long as it's big enough to hold the macaroons (and an attendant to sell them to me, along with a cup of coffee), that's all that matters.

The macaroons seem a little high-priced (but what in Vegas isn't?), but once you take a bit, you'll know instantly that you would pay more.  They're delicate and chewy all at the same time.  Not overly sweet, but sweet enough to satisfy a bakery craving.  The outer shell crumbles nicely, and the core is creamy and firm.

I dream about these macaroons.  You need one.  Go get one- or a dozen.
