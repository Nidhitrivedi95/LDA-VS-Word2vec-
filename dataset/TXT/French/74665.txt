xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g This place was EXTREMELY overrated. The "window view" we got was less than ideal, and we could barely even see half of the fountain show. The best part of the food was the crab appetizer, but other than that it was sub-par and WAY overpriced. The cheapest cocktail on the menu was a Not Your Father's Root Beer which I payed $10 or $11 for. The main course was chicken, which I would NOT recommend to anyone. The waitress was nice enough. Overall I was very disappointed and would never go here again.
