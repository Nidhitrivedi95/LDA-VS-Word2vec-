SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ Horrible service. Waiter passed by our table and would serve others but never came to check on us after he got our order. We waved him down for check, once my food was cold and I was trying to get something different because it was the driest chicken sandwich I had ever had, no cheese on it despite cheese being on the description. Meatloaf wasn't so good. Only thing I could eat was the fries and the server did nothing about it but ask if I wanted to take the dry sandwich home because they are usually dry according to him. 

Would not recommend this place. 
Maybe trying something different could change my mind but for now, for a slow afternoon, it was poor service.
