m9aFZk1f8tSv248YErbpQA I came with my Mom, and we are both french. We were expecting a lot because we know how good crepes are in France. 
First, the welcome was so-so, just came in and a guy told us "hello, sit down where you want", leaving us abandoned in the middle of an empty room (all the other customers were outside). The second employee was so rushed, expecting for our order quickly. 
Then, the food. I chose the salade nicoise, nice but unexpected ingredients inside. Never seen potatoes in real french salade nicoise. I had to order more dressing because the tuna was a bit dry. My mother took a crepe "brittany", with chicken, tomatoe, cheese and bechamel sauce. The crepe was gray instead of brown in France, the side salad was awful, just a slice of tomatoe and the green salad was not fresh at all... So bad !
The creme brulee was nice, but too much sugar on the top. 
Fortunately, the expresso was wonderful and delicious, the best drunk in Arizona !
