xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g Hubby and I enjoyed a lovely dinner here on a recent Monday night.  I was a bit apprehensive - you know when you have a great experience at a restaurant and are afraid it can never be as good the second time?  My sister and I dined here last year and the food, service, and ambience were off the charts good -- and we had just gone up without reservations one night when we realized we were starving and managed to snag a great table.

Well my second visit was just as good.  From the moment we entered we felt welcomed.  Our lead server John Paul was everything you would hope for - efficient, helpful, friendly, there when you need him without hovering.  All the other staff were top notch, too.

Everything we had was delicious and beautifully prepared.  For example, I chose the vegetarian entree because it sounded so yummy.  It was.  Delicate crepes were filled with artichokes and walnuts and sat on a bed of the most delicious tomato coulis.  MMMM.

The view of the Bellagio fountains certainly adds to the overall experience here, but I think Eiffel Tower's food and service stands on its own even without the spectacular scenery out the window.
