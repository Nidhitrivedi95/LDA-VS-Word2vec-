ucgzkl7atsBMGu4gGpmHfw I ordered the eggs benedict with peameal. I love my poached eggs soft/runny. I'm not sure if it was intentional or not, but it was the runniest poached eggs i've ever had. even some of the whites were still runny. tasted delicious nonetheless. Salad tasted fresh and healthy but didn't taste bitter. the hashbrowns were pretty cool.

my friend's croque madame looked delicious too.
