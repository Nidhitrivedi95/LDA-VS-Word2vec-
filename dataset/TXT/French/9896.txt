4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw This is consistently a great restaurant to go to on The Strip: the service is great and the food is fantastic.

The typical thing to order are the Steak and Frites, which are always a great option.  There are plenty of great steak options and all are great quality beef.  Even the bread that arrives with dinner is fresh and steaming and perfect when you add the butter to it...the bread also arrives with a brined/pickled carrot slaw/salad that is surprisingly good - tangy with a bit of spice and perfect with buttered bread.  The wine list is great and one can find something that suits their palate - I had a Pinot Nior that was delicate, but stood up to the strong flavor of the beef.  The desserts are also really good - profiteroles, chocolate cake, bread pudding.
