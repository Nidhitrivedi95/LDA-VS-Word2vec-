Yp9w4nhUowBU_IS_StFXbQ Great food, high quality ingredients (even homemade ketchup), attentive and friendly service. I'll call out our waitress, Brandy, for being especially awesome. Often times, restaurant staff mills about mindlessly but not so here. They are very aware of what's going on and they aim to please. Normally good service blends into the background but I really noticed how attentive and on top of things they were here. I had the salmon Benedict, which began was fantastic. For breakfast or lunch, this would be my go to restaurant at the Wynn/Encore.
