Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA We went up to Mix about 9:45 one Friday night for a drink.  We did not eat here but after my one visit up to Mix, I am dying to go back and dine.  The view was fantastic and worth the 11 dollar Grey Goose and Soda.  They even let us sit at a table without trying to pretend like it was "Reserved" for bottle service like most other lounges.  We really went for the view and it is worth 45 minutes of your time.  It is best to go before 10pm to avoid the cover charge.  Also, they had a line waiting to get in when we left...even though it was not crowded inside.  It is that "our bar is so cool, it has a line" line.  

Anyway, THEHotel looked pretty cool, but I will never go back to gamble at Mandaley Bay.  The dealers are asses.
