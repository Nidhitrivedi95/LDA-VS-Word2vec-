AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw Had brunch here and everything was amazing...

...Except the service. Our waiter spilled coffee on me twice, was barely paying attention when he took our order and we kept having to repeat ourselves, and the food, while delicious, took forever to arrive. It's a small place, we didn't order anything complicated (pastries, french toast, eggs...your normal breakfast foods) and you'd think they'd want to turn over the tables quicker, but no. It took over 20 minutes after we ordered for us to receive our food.

So I give 4 stars for the food and place and 0 for the overall service.
