Yp1swb-8pO8i-6-jaK2tsA Wow, I ordered Cesar Grilled Chicken Salad and the server came with a plate that I was not able to see the chicken, I after digging under the cheese and founded 4 pcs of chicken, well I looked at the server and asked her are you kidding me and I was told the regular portion is 4 ounces and if I wanted more chicken that will be have to pay extra for the chicken that should be there to begin. 
Well I'm not afraid to speak my mind so I told her to take back I don't want this, if wanted a Cesar salad without chicken I'll had order that. The manager on duty come backs few minutes later while my wife was eating her Tilapia dish with another Cesar Salad but now they were 7 pcs of chicken chopped in small squares still was no more than 4 ounces and again I told her take back. 
Well my wife was so hungry from waiting that she did not mind eating the Tilapia dinner that was served for  small child portion. At this location serving are small but their price is very deep.
The server are the worst ever, you have to remain them to refill your drinks. Don't expect any good customer service at this location, I believe they don't know how.
Manager at this location gets an (F) from me, after waiting for over 30 minutes to get serve and all she can say to me if you want to see the chicken you have to order extra meat at an extra cost.
I been to this location once before and the previous time was not as bad as last night.
Dinner for 2 average prices is with non-alcoholic drinks is about $50.00.
Mimi's Cafe where is the chicken? Are customer are so Idiots that you get away with serving them this way?
Well after my wife finish her dinner at your place, we were still hungry so we went to I Hop Restaurant down the street and got so overwhelm with the chunk of chicken on the chicken Cesar Salad. Mimi's can you guess what?  We pay a lot less and got excellent service?
