t_1myTZfYeEQ07Jr8JEF5Q I've been to the apple harvest season the last two years and both previous  years were exceptional and absolutely blew me away. I don't know what happened this year but I found the first entree, a a salad overly drenched in a salty fishy caesar house dressing on regular lettuce (if it was romaine it was the poorest variety is ever seen throw in some big ass croutons with chunks of what I'm guessing to be smoke cured ham, couldn't really tell because of the over powering flavour of fried smelt and salt.... And every dish there after felt as if I was a contestant on fear factor... Yeah, there was a couple decent cream sauces here and there but nothing compared to the years before. It felt like there was no continuum to the plates being served. Just a repetition of pick the bones out of your fish and let's throw some food gras on top to make it fancy.... I won't waste my time or gas or sleep going back.g
