nkHaix6KenApS8M-liZsCQ BFF and I had a night out after our workout at the Village and chose Christophers, I and my other girlfriend were immediately turned off when we were greeted or should I say ignored by the host/owner of the lounge, she checked us up and down and we assume she was offended and judgemental that we would have the audacity to not dress to the nines to dine in her restaurant.  We were there to eat enjoy each other's company, good wine and spend money, the place was dead it was a monday night big deal if we were wearing workout clothes!!  After getting over the snoottiness of this woman, we actually enjoyed a delicious dinner among some of our choices were sweetbreads, the cheese tray, duck pizza, and the lobster pie.  The waitress was outstanding, had an amazing knowledge of wine but to tell you the truth I never got over the weird feeling I got from the owner, to top it off, my BFF even commented that the chef owner was there as well and as we all were walking out of their empty restaurant not one of them had the class to say goodnight or thank you.  Really cold atmosphere!  Dont think I will be running back, we all agree we will support people who actually appreciate your business.
