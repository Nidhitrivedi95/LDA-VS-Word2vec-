aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw I love macaroons so much, I spent $17.50 on 6 macaroons. That was probably the most I spent on anything my entire weekend in Vegas aside from my flight and hotel. What was I thinking?! Well let me tell you... it was DELICIOUS and worth every penny I paid. I think I will go back for another 6 the next time I'm close to a Bouchon bakery. 

I enjoy their macaroons the most because they're sweet, but not over the top. I get a great taste without the pure sugar overpowering the flavor of the macaroon. I tried the pistachio, chocolate, lemon, vanilla, and coffee. Pistachio and chocolate were my favorite.

Their chocolate croissant was delicious. Buttery, light, and flaky. I LOVE flaky croissants even without reheating it! AH HEAVEN. 

I also got myself a "forgetaboutchu" (?? I forgot), which was alright. It was chewy, salty ,and sweet... Caramel, chocolate, nuts, sea salt. Meh, that $3.25 coulda went towards another macaroon.
