XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q This is truly fine dining at its BEST!  Everything from the atmosphere, service, food presentation...and of course, the food its self.  I think when dining at a French restaurant, one really needs to appreciate the details put into the presentation.  Did the tasting menu and everything was just remarkable.  Might set you back $500/person, but if fine dining is your thing...then I would definitely say give it a try.  As always, my opinion is just that.  Please visit and decide for yourself!
