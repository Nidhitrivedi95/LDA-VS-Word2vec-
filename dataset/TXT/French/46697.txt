nkHaix6KenApS8M-liZsCQ Another addition to "Pissed at myself for not trying sooner". I think I had't been to Christopher's sooner because of it's location. I'm usually at the Biltmore shopping and spending too much money at the Apple Store. So I usually walk on by to head home play with my new toy(s).

So I finally made a conscious effort to go and I was pretty sure upon walking in that I would regret not coming sooner. I had a few drinks at Crush lounge and though tiny, it fit the bill for an actual lounge. So many places call themselves lounges when they're just a bar trying to glorify themselves.

Crush is a true lounge-a small scale version of what you might find at a boutique hotel:intimate, dimly lit, good music and private spaces to enjoy a cocktail with someone special. I have to make it an effort to come here for cocktails more often because the vibe here is usually what I'm looking for-mental note made.

After drinks we took a seat at the Kitchen Bar, where it was awesome to watch Christopher and his team at working creating culinary works of art. I went on a Monday where I was able to take advantage of one of their specials: grilled tenderloin with au gratin potatoes for $20. SCORE!!!!! It was served sliced up and served with a Cabernet reduction which was delicious. I also got to try some mushroom and arugula pizza which was served on such heavenly crust. Everything was c'est magnifique!

I really have to applaud them as well for a top notch wine list. I LOVE South African wine and there are very few places in the U.S. that  feature on their wine list. So as if I wasn't happy enough with my meal and the experience this little extra plus is what earned them five stars in my book.

This is a very nice place and I can't wait to bring my family here. I'm sure a lot of folks may overlook this place if they're busy shopping. If nothing else, stop in for lunch and see why you need ot make it back for dinner.
