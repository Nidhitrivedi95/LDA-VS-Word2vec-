4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw We ordered steak, sea scallops, oysters and mussels. The food was OK, but not out of this world. We waited almost 2 hours. We have had much better food than this. But more than the food alone, we enjoyed our dinner in the patio watching the fountain show at Bellagio. Perfect location for a romantic dinner and people watching. French waiter was also entertaining to interact with.
