3jKUbhGSjFTv5jZ0wnW0xA being in montreal, i decided it was finally time to try a french restaurant. i have no standards of authenticity or any of those claims to stake down while i write this since this is my first and only time to have ever dined at a french restaurant (thus far.)

i went on the recommendation of yelp reviews that i should try two things: french onion soup and mac and cheese (preferably with duck confit,) and thus i did.

french onion soup: delicious. the whole thing was wonderful. i've had french onion soup before but not like this. i think particularly is was whatever kind of charred flavor was brought out by burning the cheese. it was pretty amazing though. i would have went back for this alone.

mac and cheese w/ duck confit: it was like swimming through a sea of cream and pasta. it was so thick it could stand on it's own. the cheese on top was another 1000 calories of yum. i couldn't finish it though. it was far too rich and the serving, enormous. the duck confit on top was a nice touch -- a kind of dry yet savory morsel. went well with the m&c.

also, i would recommend the warm goat cheese salad. good starter. seating is TIGHT despite the multiple floors of this place. getting here early might get you a seat, but the service goes down hill the busier it gets. there were only three in the waitstaff the night we were there. they were SLAMMED as in literally speed walking.

tip: do not overload on the bread. the servings are american-sized portions.
