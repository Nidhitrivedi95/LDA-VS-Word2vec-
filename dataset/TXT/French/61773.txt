sphMzEIqY1I2Dzv3zLZY2g I was very impressed with both the food and the service.  When I come to Charlotte I usually have my daughter choose where we will dine.  She was in the food industry for many years and always finds interesting new places for us to try.  Chef Bernard didn't disappoint.  Our waiter was attentive and considerate.  The food was perfection on a plate.  We chose the lamb, duck and corvina and then shared the dishes.  Each one was presented in an artful way and combined surprising flavors which pleased all of us.  Don't miss this little gem.
