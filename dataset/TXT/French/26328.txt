D7CnTsm8SCmbQghz1ioPdw L'Orignal has done me and my friends so wrong.  I don't know where I can get the same quality and delicious of a meal back home.  The restaurant is on a cellar level, hidden yet present on the streets of Montreal.  The inside is cozy and romantic, with a great emphasis on game-to-table type of food.  This was no doubt the best meal of our weekend.

To start, our table ordered the Bison Tartare (game is game, right?).  This appetizer comes with a touch of Middle Eastern style - the way they separate the different ingredients - onions, cheese, pickles, meat, sauce with a fried pita bread.  We all enjoyed the game meat, just a tad different from what we normally eat.  Next, we ordered their special appetizer - salmon salad.  Raw salmon, with cucumbers, peppers, capers, and acidic goodness.  It was a salad not to be missed.  After that, they sent us a "complimentary salad".  What came out was two huge plates of salad, with kale, carrots, cucumber, pumpkin seeds, and more.  The dressing was good, making the salad amazing!  The appetizers didn't stop there.  Next, we ordered the beet risotto with walnut pesto.  Another creamy creation.  Moving on, everyone settled down to their own plate of entree.  My friend and I shared the special entree - I can't remember the specifics, but it was a trout or some kind of white fish.  Steamed fresh, took a while to cook, and decorated with tons of delicious greens.  The fish was meaty and tender.  If they keep this special entree up, you've got to try it!
