However, I found the rest of the dishes to be very, very oily.  The duck in a can was a fun concept, but way too heavy for our liking.  We also thought the chicken burger was fun since it came to us in a fast food paper box, but again, it was so oily that the paper surrounding the sandwich was soaked through.  Biggest mistake was I ordered the fish n chips b/c I'm not the foie gras fan--my husband is.  I blame myself.  Why would anyone get fish n chips at a Canadian French restaurant that focuses on foie gras and meat? The sturgeon was so fishy, I couldn't even finish it.  They were really nice about it though and let us replace the fish with something else on the menu.
