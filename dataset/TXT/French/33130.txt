HHvO4MgBFabsmlInou6viQ I am going to chalk this disaster of a brunch to growing pains of a new restaurant. A bunch of friends and I went for brunch about a month ago.

First off, the coffee is dreadful. Food is a bit all over the place. Within our group, we ordered the Atlantic farçous, Le Baratin Ploughman, and the baked French toast. The farçous was dry, and the house-made gravlax portion was exceedingly pitiful (which might have been a blessing because it was salted to high hell). The ploughman portions were also on the skimpy side. The baked French toast was passable, good taste with lots of fruit, but again, would have liked to have more toast. 

As summarized by one of my friends: just all around not great. On the plus side, their decor is quite quaint.
