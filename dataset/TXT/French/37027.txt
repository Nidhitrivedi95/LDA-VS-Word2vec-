in3zjiaLpNzr9G3K35gAJQ I am a Francophile and this is Phoenix's most authentic and delicious French bistro. I've been here dozens of times and probably have tried just about everything on the menu. My favorites are the pork loin, beef bourguignon, or any of the daily prix-fixe menus. The plates are a modest size, so I recommend the prix fixe menu or an appetizer salad if you are starved. Before you order, the server brings you a plate of buttery homemade croissants. After every meal you are given a complimentary dessert. Frankly, if you're on a budget, you can order just a main plate (with the free croissants and dessert) and you will leave the Bistro full and satisfied with a $15 ish dent in your wallet. On the other extreme, you can have a decadent 3 or 4 course meal with a bottle of French wine and easily pay upwards of $50 a person. The food is all served on beautiful vintage Villeroy & Boch china with whimsical patterns of flowers or horses. The space of the Bistro is intimate: tightly packed tables, no hostess stand, low ceilings. I love it. The customers here tend to be a bit older and I've never seen kids at the Bistro.
