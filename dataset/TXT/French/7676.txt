4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I really wanted to come here after reading some friends' reviews on yelp.  It was nice that we made a reservation ahead of time so we could skip the wait line, but the wait didn't seem that bad either on a Sunday brunch time.  We got the quiche, a blueberry muffin, and a lobster roll.  The blueberry muffin was okay, would have been better if it was hot.  BUT, the quiche and lobster roll were bombdiggidty.  Large portions too.  Wish I took a picture of the lobster roll, but it came in a "brick toast" with a little pocket at the top with lobster filling stuffed inside.  It was certainly unique and definitely delicious.  Lots of people were ordering the standard ham and cheese sandwhich that you would normally order at a french brunch place, and they looked to be enjoying themselves as well.

Can't wait to return!
