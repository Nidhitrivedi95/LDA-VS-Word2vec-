XI3iNUgChOfJk5ppjKVEQQ What a wonderful spot.  I've been here a couple of times and been fortunate enough to get seated without a reservation, which frankly seems like a miracle, I would recommend making one.  Great food, great service and a great atmosphere.  Getting the one outside table they have in the summer time will forever be one of my best memories of Montreal...  sipping on  glass of wine, eating excellent food and watching the world go by is one of my favorite things to do...  even when the world is speaking French.
