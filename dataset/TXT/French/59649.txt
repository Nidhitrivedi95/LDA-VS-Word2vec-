s1w-XoUJ2wuK9OJ7ivpi3Q Bernard's Bistro was my favorite restaurant in the Las Vegas area, and I am happy to report that CB Legacy follows in that tradition. I have already visited Legacy twice, even once before its official opening, and I plan to return many times.

Yes, I know about the Strip. I've heard of their Michelin rated venues. I understand they are supposed to be the epitome of service and class. There are many restaurants on Las Vegas Boulevard that I love, but as a local, I want to enjoy dinner at a place with classic service and excellent food, but more importantly, that place needs to feel like it belongs to me. 

CB Legacy captures that atmosphere, as did Bernard's Bistro. The cosmetic changes have only enhanced that style to more closely follow a classic vein. When visiting Legacy, I am reminded of the fine restaurants of my home on the East Coast. They serve generations from the comfort of an unassuming neighborhood location. Restaurants in towering hotels and casinos? Those will come and go with the waves of fickle tourists. As its name indicates, there is a Legacy to honor here.

The food itself is an elegant fusion of French and California cuisine. Refreshing yet savory with a subtle artistic presentation, you will have fast favorites, and if you return, you will have too many favorites to count.

CB Legacy is the kind of place you want to tell all your friends about, while also keeping it an absolute secret. You'll be damned if you recommend it to someone who lacks the appreciation. 

Compliments to the new management lead by Chanthy, who had the great insight to keep the menu virtually unchanged. While visiting, I also met Anthony Cortez, who assisted Chanthy in adding the new black and red color pallette. Black napkins, my friends, that's how you know you're talking about professionals.
