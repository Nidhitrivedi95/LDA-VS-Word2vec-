gh6__q2WXFuyN8gt6VAnWw If you want a good dinner without the pretentiousness of the strip, this is a great place to be! This food surpassed my expectations for a strip mall restaurant. We had oysters-so fresh! And shrimp tails, as well the lamb shanks. The owner came out and talked us thru the menu, and described everything to a "t". I will be back to try other menu items. I was very pleased
