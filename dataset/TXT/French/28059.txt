- rabbit tartine 
- Roasted squash salad 
- Foie Gras
- Braised Lamb

Overall, a very good restaurant.  Because I had heard such great things, perhaps my expectations were overly high, so I wasn't wowed but can certainly appreciate the attention to detail on the plates and services wise. A bit too pricey, though, for what it is. 

The restaurant is very quaint and got definitely want to sit on the patio in the lane way if you are able to. The foie Gras and rabbit terrine were tasty starters. The rabbit was the winner of the two. Also, the roasted squash salad was fantastic. Very refreshing flavours and the squash was definitely the star...it wasn't drowning in greenery 

The lamb was cooked perfectly. But nothing novel about the preparation. 

Service was fantastic. Our waitor was attentive, made good suggestions and checked in with us the right amount.
