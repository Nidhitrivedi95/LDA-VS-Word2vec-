YH8Bn-7pLR-SFR8MCgQj1w This place has the best croissants in the city!  I've gone to a few bakeries in search of the perfect, flaky butter croissant.

The coffee is not great, the seating is cramped and tiny tables (4 tables stacked against each other on the south side of the establishment). They also have a "bar" stool long table .

It's worth coming for a coffee in the morning on the weekends, just to enjoy the croissants!
