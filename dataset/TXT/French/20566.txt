AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw If you would like a decadent breakfast but don't want to wait in the line for the buffet, you won't go wrong coming here.  We split a quiche and apple crepe and a chocolate croissant and they were all delicious.  The staff could have been a little more attentive as I had to return  to the counter for the water I had asked for with my order and to fetch some silverware which was out. 

If this were a local cafe, I would probably find myself here on occasion getting breakfast.
