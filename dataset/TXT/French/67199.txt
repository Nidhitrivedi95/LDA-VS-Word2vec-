USleI8g1UVN9-9jm-b4uIg 4.5 of 5 stars (excellent fine dining).

What to wear: a jacket would be nice, maybe a tie (if it's a special occasion).

What to take: a thirst for wine.  The Fig Tree has some awesome prices on more expensive bottles.  For example: Joseph Phelps
Insignia, 2006, Napa Valley cab.  Price?  $140.  Total Wine sells the same bottle for $150.

If you have mobility problems, be sure to insist on being seated downstairs for there are some tables up.

Want to give them 4.5 stars because they don't do the little extras as the best 5 star places (e.g., amuse-bouche, palette cleanser, etc.).

In a lovingly refurbished older home.  Well-trained staff.  Simple, uncluttered menu with enough choices for all.

About $60 per person, no dessert, no booze, gratuity not included.

About my ratings:

Only fine dining establishments can garner five stars.  Until yelp realizes that a fast food joint cannot possibly be ranked equally with a $100 per person place, I need to draw the line somewhere.  If we were only talking about the quality and presentation of the food, it would be a different story.  But, as we know, yelp's rankings take into account the entire dining experience.

Therefore, I divide restaurants into three categories (and I wish yelp would do the same):

1) fast food (no table service)

2) casual dining (table service)

3) fine dining (linen napkins, no plastic cups, no TV's in dining room, typically more expensive than casual dining)

Fine dining can earn a max of five stars.  Casual dining can earn a max of four stars.  Fast food can earn a max of three stars.
