They offer omelettes, waffles, salmon, roast or prime rib, salads, vegetables, fruit, desserts, mimosas, etc.

I stumbled upon this gem and am so glad I did.  I got to eat before hiking Mount Royal and it was exactly the kind of food I needed.  I could've spent more time here it was that enjoyable!
