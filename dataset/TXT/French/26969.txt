Dcj69NZJnbJhK-YHP_nULA We really like this place  My wife and I had dinner here on Sunday night. I had the pheasant and she had the scallops. Both meals were excellent. The pheasant was moist and the skin was crispy. The sauce, vegetables and sweat potato that accompanied it were perfect. Sunday's are half price bottles of wine and we had a good Cote Du'Rhone. We split the chocolate yogurt desert which was also very good. Our waitress was very nice and polite and she spent some time with us explaining the menu and dishes. We will definitely go back here the next time we are in Madison.
