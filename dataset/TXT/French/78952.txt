ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug OMG. Over priced food... Please walk to Denny's and buy yourself the $6 grand slam instead of paying $16 for it here!

Horrible food.... OK service... sticky tables... the list goes on. 

Anyways, don't waste your money here! Go down the hall and go to the buffet... same price, all you can eat!
