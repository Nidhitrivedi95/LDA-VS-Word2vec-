z6ZPIpO_1Rx69k9y2DQ7Bw I attended a pre-opening event for charity, so for the sake of full disclosure the meal was free and the staff was still in training. Because of that I'll update my review when I go again after it opens on 12/3. I think if it keeps up this way with the full menu I'll go 5 stars.

The food was delicious and presented well. My table had Quiche Lorraine (which I missed snapping a picture of but it was delicious), a custom crepe, and Crepes Romanoff. The presentation was nice, and the service was also nice. Even though this was a free meal they accommodated a custom order graciously, which says a lot. We shared all of the food so everyone at the table got to try everything ordered. It was all really good but the crust on the quiche was so beautifully crisp and flaky, not the anemic yuck you sometimes see on quiche. For me that was the first wow. We also got croissants before leaving, which were very well made. I had the plain croissant and both taste and texture were spot on.

All in all I can't wait to go again and try it. This place is definitely worth visiting. I'm looking forward to trying the lunch and dinner menus in future visits. I'm also looking forward to trying some of the other breads and pastry.
