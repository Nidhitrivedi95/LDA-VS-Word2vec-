Ykxnrs6TkoWQPsStMwPseQ Went there for a group dinner. The staff was really friendly and service was great.
The food was good (I had the cod as the main course). Prices were fair. Around 45-40$ for the entrée, main course + side dish + dessert. 

My only complain is that my plate was a little bit cold but other than that it was #1.

Would go again.
