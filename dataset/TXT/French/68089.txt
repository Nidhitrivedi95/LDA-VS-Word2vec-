Bonus is Cheap Date Night, the first Wed of every month that offers a couple a three-course meal + one beer/wine choice for under ~$75 at an upscale bistro. This regular event forces you to wander outside of your comfort food zone and try dishes you normally wouldn't choose, but we're always surprised at how well composed they are. Desserts are on point, too. Service is polished yet unpretentious. And the space has an understated elegance to it that makes it special. Parking is suboptimal with the removal of the surface lot down the road just past Tamarind, but keep circling the blocks...Legume is well worth the aggravation.
