myJ6pgIhN42EQh2sAVXKoQ Although prices were pretty high even for a gourmet burger place, I really enjoyed my food here. 
I had the "Wild Life" and my husband had the "Dream Come True". The burger patties were very moist, well cooked and tasty. The truffle mayo was an interesting touch to my burger, I felt like I was eating a really fancy burger. My husband's burger was very meaty and tasty...if you love anything pork (pulled pork and bacon), then you'll love this burger! We also shared a "Toma Poutine", which covered the fries in truffle oil, cheese curds and bacon..and omg it was heaven! I regret not ordering the larger size instead if the small.


Ambiance was quite classy for a burger place. Nice booths, modern decor and dim lighting. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive. No complaints at all.

I think the prices is still a bit too high for what you get. Yes it is a gourmet joint, but still it's not a 5 star restaurant. But other than the prices, this place gets a deserving 4 stars! I'd come back again
