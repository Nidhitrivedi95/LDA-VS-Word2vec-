QeEQXdto_4wFRaNKyIygRA Recalled how great their Thursday lunch special was so called in my order for pick up.  Crowded as usual which is fine...used to that but got dark meat instead of what I had requested and potatoes were not great...felt like someone new is in the kitchen.  Too much sauce on brocoli.  Maybe it was an off day...sadly I can't make it there often so was disconcerting.  Good price and very sweet tea.
