rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A We had been looking forward to Sunday Brunch at Bouchon for weeks and were pleased that we didn't encounter a long wait when we arrived. Got a seat on the patio with a view of... well, middle aged women in one piece swim suits? WTF? I tried to focus on closer surroundings. 

I had french toast - a very unexpected presentation. A cylindrical tower of brioche, custard and apples. Very tasty and quite filling.

My wife had the most excellent Croque Madame. But as far as I am concerned, the star of the show was the French Fries. Possibly the best I've ever had.

Service was perfect. All and all a perfect Sunday morning.
