JxtwVeuCBX99KEciymlYXA Country French cuisine served in a neo-industrial setting in waterfront Old Montreal? Throw in an expansive outdoor area, fantastic service and one of the best restaurant musical selections I have heard make this a fantastic experience.

Simple elegant cuisine (salads, pates,  cured cheeses, beautiful breads, roasted meats)

I feel horrible for forgetting the owners name, as he was exceptionally gracious. 


Great bar as well.

My only regret is I didnt have time to come back.
