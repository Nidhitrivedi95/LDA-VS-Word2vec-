We were staying at Bellagio and seeing "O" that night, so it seemed like a perfect restaurant for that night. My husband ordered the Black Truffle Menu and I had the Vegetarian Menu. The service was good, the first couple of courses were great, however when the main courses arrived, we were very disappointed. My husband's filet was under-seasoned and didn't have a crusty sear and the plating was extremely unappealing. My plate of steamed veggies was under-seasoned and boring. We noticed as we were sort of pushing our dinner around our plates, we were being ignored by our waiter for about 30 minutes. Neither one of us finished our dinner. For $450, for two people, WITHOUT ALCOHOL, we were hoping for a much better experience and while we don't regret trying it out, we do wish we had complained IN PERSON, but we had to get to the show. We expected a lot more out of such a well-reviewed restaurant. Maybe they just turn it on for the critics.
