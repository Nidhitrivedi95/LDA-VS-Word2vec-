An_U8woQkFVsMqVblkImZQ Went on Sunday early afternoon for some brunch with a friend. Atmosphere was great, love the windows letting all the sunlight in. Food was great, we had the three cheese quiche and some blood orange tea. We stayed for around 2 hours and I have to admit service is a bit spotty, and didn't get better as people started leaving around 3PM. 

Overall great place and would go back for brunch sunday or lunch on weekday.
