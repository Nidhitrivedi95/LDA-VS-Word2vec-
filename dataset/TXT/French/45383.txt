mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q This place is beyond good, it's INSANE! By far the best meal, service and overall experience I have had in a restaurant that I can remeber. Extremely friendly and attentive service aside from food that is a gastronomic orgasam! Love Love Love this place! BTW, ask for the server Eric, he is easy on the eyes and gives impecable service as well as all of the staff. Extremely Pleased and I will be back next time I am in Vegas!
Suggestions, chef's tasting menu and wine pairing! Not inexpensive but well worth it!
