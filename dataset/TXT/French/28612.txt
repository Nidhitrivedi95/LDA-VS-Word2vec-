eJ9L40jm5VOXCIq7xs9kQw I cam here to try something new, since the reviews were great. It was kinda of disappointing. The food is good no objection there, however the price is way over the norm. Minimum of 40$ per person just for the main dish. 16$ salads? really? We were a group of 4, and the final bill did really shock us. 

The service is average, nothing extraordinary and in need of some improvement, waiters do need to be polite to their customers and not give attitude when you ask questions about items on the menu.

The restaurant is a nice decor. It has the vision of the Old Montreal area.

If you have the wallet, I do suggest you try it. However I shall not return for a average quality meal at the price they are charging.
