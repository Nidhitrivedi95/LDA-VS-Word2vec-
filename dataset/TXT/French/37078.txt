IQ5TkJX2Hin9O0uJNDoyZw I was hesitant to eat there because the restaurant was empty. But it was freezing and I really wanted to eat Vietnamese. I got the chicken vegetable soup. Delicious and freshly made with grilled chicken and crushy veggies. Loved it! I hope they had more choices and more traditional vietnamese meals.
