LQ_gYNs5E10IGFE0NOyD7A The service was brilliant and the food was pretty awesome. We sat outside and right away the manager rushed over to make sure we had an umbrella over us to create shade. He promptly brought over a water bowl for our dog too (without us having to even ask). Our server Kevin was fantastic. He made some great food and drink recommendations. We had the captain crunch pancakes (amazing) and the pork chilaquiles (solid). We had a regular Bloody Mary and a Bloody Mary infused with cucumber gin (which was out of this world). I probably would have had another 5 of bloodys if they were a little cheaper. Overall, a little pricy, but hey its scottsdale. We will for sure be back.
