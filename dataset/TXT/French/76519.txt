Yp9w4nhUowBU_IS_StFXbQ Sundays are for brunch and what a pretty place Tableau is ! Unfortunately we were not able to sit outside since its 47 degrees outside and they are doing some work on the pool area which their patio is facing but nevertheless it a great place for brunch. Vegan pancakes were delicious and orange zest fresh squeezed juice was a nice addition. Good cappuccinos, purity juice was excellent too and acai booster was a true booster. I guess we are on the health track... for a few hours... until the next amazing restaurant in Las Vegas !
