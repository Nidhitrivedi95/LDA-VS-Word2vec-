gISrxk4A5dfrjDivkC-L-Q Love this place. Everything was so delicious and decadent. We had some canelés and the famous Hot chocolate. They service was great friendly and helpful. Nice quiet place to chat with a friend or for a meeting but also had a constant stream of people in and out so you know it's a popular place. We had some allergy concerns and the staff were very helpful showing us the information sheets for each pastry so we could be sure there would be no problems.
