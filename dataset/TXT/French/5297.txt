3FlWR_osNPb8dcqLgHebHw It's been quite a while since we went to Mimi's.  I recently signed up for their club, so since we had a BOGO, we decided to go back to one of our original haunts when we first hit town.  Not much has changed at Mimi's since then, except that our more sophisticated palates, the plethora of restaurants we now have to choose from, and the quality of the newer offerings make Mimi's seem like a throwback.

I ordered the salmon.  I almost never have that unless it's wild salmon, and this was Atlantic, but all the other offerings seemed too heavy.  The menu stated that it was "with a light Chardonnay Dijon sauce, but I was dismayed to find that this was a cream sauce, which I avoid like the plague.  That wasn't explained on the menu, which is glaring, IMO.  I'm not one of them, but there are many lactose-intolerant people who need this information.  The waitress offered to change it, but there wasn't anything else that piqued my interest.  The sautéed garlic spinach and roasted potatoes that came with it were delicious, and I had no complaints about the salmon itself, which was properly cooked.  My husband had the pot roast and he was satisfied with it.

Service was very good, efficient but a bit impersonal.

Overall, Mimi's is okay, but nothing that sings to me and makes me want to rush back.  With so many terrific restaurants in our town, this one will remain an afterthought.
