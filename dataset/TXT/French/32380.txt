gxMa7j1LXIUxxBoP0osDpA We stumbled onto this place after a long day of show during Jazz Fest.
Unheurseument nous n'apportez pas notre vin mais c'etait bien! (They don't serve wine/alcohol so you need to bring your own.

Anyway, I remember I had the duck breast and it was fairly succulent. Don't remember what the lady had but I think it was pasta which fairly good too.

Service was fine but I really liked the decor - simple, modern, understated but cool all the same.

I wouldn't mind returning here next time around.
