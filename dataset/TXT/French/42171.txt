kYATtIsqVEoawS47UcSlDA I have a simple argument for why you should stop what you are doing right now and go find this food truck.

Duck Fat Fries!

Yeah, I'm sure I can stop right there.  Game, set, match!  You lose the debate, but win the lottery in taste.

You need more convincing?  Blasphemy!!!  But okay, how about I blow your mind with a single word.

NUTELLA!!!

Oh, hey I'll wait a minute so you can recover your senses.  That's right, low and behold they made nutella, banana, pecan filled crepes and it was good.  Damn good!  Push your mother over and step on her neck to get the last one good.

My sister introduced me to this food truck at which I hold worship every week.  And for this I owe her a kidney.  RUN! don't walk to this food truck.

P.S. - Tillamook cheese rules!  And if sweet isn't your thing because your mother smoked when she was pregnant.  Than they have you covered with their mouthwatering savory crepes too.
