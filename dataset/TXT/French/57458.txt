rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A This was the highlight of my week long stay in Vegas.

I will agree with other yelpers, the restaurant is great because it's far enough away you forget you are in Vegas.  YAY! A+

My friend and I met for breakfast with no reservations.  It was relatively early for Vegas (9:00 AM).  We were told it would be a 25 minute wait.  As we were there for work and needed to get to a trade show, this was not good news for us.  Boo! C-

Ten minutes later we were fetched, a table had opened up earlier then anticipated.  YAY!!  A++

Coffee?  Not bad.
Quiche?  Pretty good.
French Toast with a side of sausage?  EXCELLENT.

I'm still dreaming about it.  I love the ambiance and the staff was so friendly.

I can't wait to go back.
