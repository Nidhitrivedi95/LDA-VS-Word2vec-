aSC-WLyJptVpziJpR98Ykg We loved this place! The ambience is so nice and we really loved the wine. The beef tenderloin entree was incredible and definitely not too small, as I have seen in other reviews. The garlic Rosemary butter that came with the bread was so good too!! Staff spoke great English and was very nice, even though we were late to our reservation.
