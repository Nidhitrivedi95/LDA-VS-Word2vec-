Unfortunately the tasting menu was a huge disappointment for me and my guest, who found all the food too salty, and didn't appreciate the excessive repetition of dashi broth, winter melon and soft tofu. The fish quality was mediocre at best, which was a huge shock. The Yunaghi Caesar beverage was easily the worst Caesar I have ever tasted. The fusion of French and Japanese has potential, but Yunaghi didn't achieve it.  I mentioned this to the restaurant but they were dismissive and trying to turn my table so they can "process" the next couple with their fast food fine dining experience. It was all too formulaic and distracting - really a very poor experience unbefitting sophisticated Toronto diners. Save yourself $300 and rather go to one of Toronto's many other options that are vastly superior.
