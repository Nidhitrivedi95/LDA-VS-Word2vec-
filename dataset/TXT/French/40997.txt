kcF-en40P3J9L8nLy5lKqQ We went here tonight for my sister's birthday dinner and the meal was amazing, I am definitely a fan of Central Bistro!  The space is beautiful inside, but I do think it is bit noisy inside, between the music playing a bit too loudly and the high ceilings, but I the food and service is excellent!

We had the Vichyssoise to start, and the cold soup on a such a hot day was just perfect.  We also had the wood fired artichoke, which was seasoned really nicely and then taken to another dimension when dipped in the aioli dipping sauce.

My sister and I both got the scallop risotto and it was AMAZING!  The scallops were perfectly cooked with a nice sear on the outside, and then the risotto was filled with flavor from the bacon, corn and peas...it was a match made in heaven!  I also thought that the price was really reasonable, at just $18 for 3 large scallops and a huge portion of the risotto.  We had some key lime pie to finish the meal, and it was the perfect ending.

The food will definitely keep me coming back....I need to try their brunch sometime soon!
