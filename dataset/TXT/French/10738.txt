4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Best breakfast in Las Vegas. We loved it so much we had breakfast there two days in a row. Also, they serve Intelligentsia coffee (our favorite) and that just sealed the deal (after looking for good coffee for two days - this was an amazing discovery). If you don't get the berry waffle, you're not doing it right.
