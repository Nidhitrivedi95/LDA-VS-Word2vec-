COgwFthJpS4We16W5Gf4lw The fresh basket of veges were really unique and delicious. Love the yummy olives that came with the bread. We had the french onion soup and the other appetizer we had was really delicious. But the entrees were not as good as we expected. But chocolate lava with house made vanilla ice cream and the mint tea for dessert were amazing~! The service was great and the staffs were welcoming.
