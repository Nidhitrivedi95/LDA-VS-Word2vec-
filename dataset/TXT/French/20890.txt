AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw Was so excited to try this little bistro, it was right in our hotel and passing by everyone's good looked so tasty.  We were there celebrating my friends birthday and Bachelorette so we stopped in here for a brunch and the service just started off so terrible.  The hostess up front was so rude so that should've been our sign and we should've just left.  We stayed and the server took forever to get over to us.  Food after ordered probably took over 20 minutes to come out cold.  My friends had ordered the lobster bisque soup and said it tasted like watered down fish soup.  The eggs I ordered were overdone and potatoes were too salty.  When we told him the soup was not good he didn't apologize and just said I'll take it off the check but I probably won't be back for a while I'm busy.  What?  Where and what profession is it ok to say that to someone?  I would def not recommend this place all the way from the food to staff.
