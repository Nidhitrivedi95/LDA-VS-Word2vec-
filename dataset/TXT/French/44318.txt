ME6D5nLlfG0xZCtICOYDuw The atmosphere was great for brunch! Busy but not too busy. We definitely got our moneys worth on the $12 bottomless mimosas. Service was pretty slow on the drinks, our server seemed very frazzled. The buffet food was good, but not anything super impressive. I think that's always going to happen with buffet-style. 

It was a fun experience for brunch so I would go back again!
