oPGUbqBpHNZvVu9gAFJbMQ Excellent service and excellent food. Attentive wait staff. We enjoyed the oysters and scallop ceviche  for starters. The waiter brought us a complementary third starter to share that was just as yummy. Our son loved the frog legs, the first time he has tried them. I have never seen such a large dish of mussels and they were delicious! Definitely recommend this restaurant.
