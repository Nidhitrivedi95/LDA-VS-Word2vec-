K2C8dSx9215LLcIzHL959Q My girlfriend and I went here for Valentine's day.  It was a fixed menu for 85$ each (as you can see elsewhere magnificently described), and we had a few glasses of wine for a grand total of 200$.

We both enjoyed every piece of food that was prepared regardless of our normal preferences.  For me, at this price point it is the service that stands out, and the Chef and staff stood out.  It's often difficult to find good service in Pittsburgh, but this place is not lacking.  Each staff member was personable, courteous, non-intrusive, responsive, knowledgeable, and engaging.

To date this was the best restaurant experience we've had in Pittsburgh.

Thanks Twisted Frenchman - we will be back
