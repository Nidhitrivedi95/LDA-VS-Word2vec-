O3OH5IEFMPtz7mPKakPZ3Q In need of an entertaining night and awesome food at a good price? Head over for their late night happy hour and sit outside on a cooler night, request the blonde waitress (she's hilarious and makes the best recommendations), order one of each taco, get some gyoza, and yakiudon or the fried rice. Don't forget to save room for dessert! 

And for those of you with a million food allergies/intolerances, just let them know! They're super accommodating!
