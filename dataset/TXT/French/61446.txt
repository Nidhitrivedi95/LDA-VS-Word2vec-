SJo_IjvzdRtCvZVN0cbrRQ I love Blue Door. Whenever I have loved ones come to visit, I make sure to take them here for breakfast. Everyone I've had the pleasure of introducing Blue Door to has loved it. The food is innovative, fresh, and outstanding, the service is always helpful and efficient, and you can tell that the owner and cooks are so passionate about what they do. If you love quality and aren't opposed to spending a few extra dollars (which it's totally worth it, in my opinion), Blue Door is the perfect place to go!
