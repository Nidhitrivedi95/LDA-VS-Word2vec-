HojKatUfX4UHWaPqtl63NQ This is another beautiful restaurant with fantastic views and a very cool vibe. The service was ok but it looked like the server had too much on his plate. Had to ask for lemons three times and he only had one chance to stop by the table. The food was very nicely presented and the flavors were right on.
