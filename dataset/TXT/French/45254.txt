mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q I know it has been almost a year since we had dinner here but I still dream of this food! We had the Menu Decouverte (tasting menu) and I would recommend this to first timers or sheltered West Texans like me.  It left me knowing what I would order the next time we visit. La Caille (quail stuffed with foie gras, served with whipped truffled mashed potatoes) was outstanding. Le Crabe Royal was divine as were the baby Kusshi Oysters in French butter. The latter is exactly what good food means... two ingredients at their finest and the taste is exceptional. There is way too much to mention but I now know that I'm overdue to come back and that, if this meal was any indication, I must eat at Joel Robuchon next door once before I die.
