j0baDQfMAGDm_QGdFMmb-Q My husband told me about this fantastic restaurant and finally he took me for my birthday. It was amazing! The onion soup was the best soup I ever had and it got better when I got my Brochettes de filet mignon, my husband got the Lamb with lots of flavor. 
This is totally a 5 star place!
