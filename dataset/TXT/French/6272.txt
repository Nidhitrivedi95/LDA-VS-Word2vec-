Was celebrating my birthday and staff signed a card and made it very personal for myself. I believe he is the GM but he visited our table numerous times and was very personable...not all about business but engaged like he knew us for years. Waiter was fantastic. Aaron made suggestions....which we took...especially the curryacki....or however you spell....curry and teriaki suaced combined.....WOW....great with all food. Aaron was not pushy...we ate at our own pace and had a fantastic night and my birthday was great"
