nkHaix6KenApS8M-liZsCQ 1st time we went we tried the 4 course meal @ $45 + $15 wine pairing a great meal and a great deal.
So of course we went back to repeat the success, just to learn that now it was $65 + wine, not sure why that increase that and the choices were not that exciting. We ended up picking from the menu. I ordered the chicken my husband the steak. Steak was great sauce was cold. The side dish, risotto with vegetables was the best of it all. My chicken was extremely disappointing dry and nothing special for $26. Finally the server came around asking if everything was ok, my husband was done with his meal at that time and I informed her about the chicken. We ordered the mousse tower which was just ok, tasted like store bought mousse and not home made.
We are not gong back.
