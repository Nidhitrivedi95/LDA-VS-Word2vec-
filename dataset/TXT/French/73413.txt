xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g 4.5 stars. The food was just amazing! I had some club sandwich and it was just wonderful! The view was just amazing and worth the extra cost for the food! I was hoping the water show across the street would be going on during the day, but no dice.  The staff was very friendly and had no problem getting my lady friend a shaw since she was cold. You take an elevator up too the restaurant, which is really cool. I recommend going in the day time if you want to save some cash. Probably a great place to take your lady to if you want to be romantic. Would not recommend doing this on a first date though as it would probably be a bit much. Minus half a star for SLOW food. I was thinking to myself, "Is the chef cooking the food in Paris or what?" :-)
