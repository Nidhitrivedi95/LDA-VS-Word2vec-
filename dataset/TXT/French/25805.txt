Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA This is an amazing restaurant with an amazing menu.

We have eaten at Alain Ducasse in The Dorchester London and whilst it was lovely the menu was super dooper fancy which doesnt suit me. The menu here was much better in my opinion although still of an extremely high standard.

The service is impeccable and they are really friendly but dont bother you. we ordered the tasting menu paired with wine and they accommodated a few little changes we requested with no problems whatsoever.

The bill came to over $300 so this is certainly not an everyday restaurant but I would highly recommended for a special occasion.
