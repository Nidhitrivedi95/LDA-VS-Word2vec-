K64Uw3a2Enh2MznpwRHWKQ For months my love has been planning an epic date night for us to come here and let me tell you, the experience was worth the wait. 
We opted for the Chef's Table/counter experience where throughout the night Chef prepares small plates for you until your belly pops or you say when! 
This is a very interactive dining experience where not only is each dish explained to you in detail but Chef Razz also mingles with you while you're indulging in some of his most delicious creations. 
We cleared seven courses each plus dessert, as well as a bottle of Spanish red. The entire experience was nothing less than amazing! 
A perfect five star, " one for the books" review of Razz's Restaurant!
