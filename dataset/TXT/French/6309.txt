4e8NoMkYUXDfy5plSZI1Dw We came here for a late lunch during the second day of our Montreal adventures.  I love the street Moutons Noirs is on--lots of adorable shops and eateries.  After noticing the shockingly reasonable lunch specials, we knew that we needed to try this place.  

Upon entering, we took note of the trippy art throughout the restaurant.  My favorite pieces were the painting with the symbols and characters from playing cards and the red pillow made to look like the devil.  Edgy but not overly so.  For lunch, I had a salad with grilled salmon which was very large and delicious especially considering the price.  The service was attentive and friendly, and the ambient French music created a relaxed atmosphere.  

While I do warn you that this is a BYOB establishment, in case you were looking for a place to have drinks with dinner, I am sure you would otherwise not be disappointed.
