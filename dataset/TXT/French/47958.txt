O3OH5IEFMPtz7mPKakPZ3Q Wow we found our new favs resto. This place is amazing. The appetizer menus are ok bit the specialty food and dinner food is out of this world. We order the black cod and the bone marrow with beef. Wow wow wow. The toro with uni and salmon sashimi was awesome. Definitely coming back to this place to try the different menu items. Food is a little pricey but all worth it.
