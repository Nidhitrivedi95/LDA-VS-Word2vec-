LUd3UdlUvCr54H-7ttm0TQ One of Montreal's hidden gems. Little cozy restaurant that uses local and organic ingredients. My friend and I sat at the bar and it was really cool to see what went on in the open kitchen that was right in front of our eyes. There were 2 members working in the kitchen as well as another staff member who seemed to be working both inside and outside. Each dish was prepared with patience and precision. We got the velvet of squash soup and mozzarella de bufflonne to start with. The soup was perfectly seasoned and smooth. The mozzarella de bufflonne was comprised of many interesting items, the tomatoes were fresh and moist, squash puree was a nice touch, pickeled squash added a nice hint of acidity to the dish, broccoli was nice and crisp, and mozzarella was decent. For the mains we got the canard and spaghetti maison. The duck was cooked beautifully, nice generous portions, and the gnocchi, parsnips, broccoli were cooked to perfection. The spaghetti was also impeccable. The sauce was flavorful, nicely seasoned. Spaghetti was cooked nicely. The apple pie dessert was a great way to end the meal. My friend and I aren't usually fans of apple pies but they nailed it. Unlike most american apple pies, it wasn't too sweet and the pastry was baked to a light crisp. Overall, great food, great service, nice atmosphere. J'aime!
