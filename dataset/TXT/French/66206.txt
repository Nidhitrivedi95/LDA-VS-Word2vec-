Nice zesty lime, satiating salsa verde, savory refried beans, decent scoop of guac and properly poached eggs. Everything came together nicely. They also had a nice hot sauce on each table. I didn't indulge but the sweet brunch offerings looked and smelled off the chain. I couldn't issue the full 5-stars because of my exquisite Mexican brunch at 'El Pocho', but this is a great restaurant.
