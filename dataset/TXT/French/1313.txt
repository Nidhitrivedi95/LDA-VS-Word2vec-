_T7f2wUgNlJqxsR-cR89SQ Everything about this place was great except the other restaurant guest. I have never eaten somewhere & felt so uncomfortable with all the staring & whispering going on. I am from Florida & maybe there is such a thing as Southern Hospitality. The servers were very kind & friendly as well as knowledgable. The food was delicious! We had the lobster bisque soup. The gnocchi app & we each had the lobster as our main course which was wonderful. Of course, thanks to all the reviews about the coconut pie we had that too & it was all that people have made it out to be & more! Save room for the pie people! I can't fault the restaurant for their rude guest therefore this place gets 5 stars. I walked out with a full & happy stomach but an uncomfortable vibe!
