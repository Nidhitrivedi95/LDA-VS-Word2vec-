kGOr_D-LNpgZ2M9N8TT4QQ Totally re-done space where I used to get my dim sum fix downtown if I didn't want to trek North.

The infamous stained glass is impressive. A very cozy french bistro , almost as coziness as Balthazar new York but close second.

The food fare was above average, quality steak frites and decent portions.
