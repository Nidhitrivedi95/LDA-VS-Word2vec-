mnn--vaYHtNyBNYFYBFIog I wanted Toqué to be the next addition to my top 5 tasting menu experiences - so I went in with no bias, only the highest expectations, and to celebrate a special occasion. Here's why it gets 3 stars:

Food: My partner and I had the 7 course tasting menu. One of the beginning courses was interesting - sea scallops served in oyster shells, cucumber juice and a dash of rhubarb. One of the 2 desserts was also interesting and scores fairly well- chamomile sorbet and foam , with a custard like roll and buckwheat crumble. Everything else was regrettably forgettable. In addition their approach to accommodating my partners pescatarianism was appalling for such a well rated restaurant - they merely substituted dishes which contained meat with a piece of fish. Having been fortunate to have had some really stellar meals in my life, I think I can safely say that a chef worth their salt wouldn't simply replace fish in a dish built around a piece of meat. Food gets a 3.

Service: We waited about 5 minutes before anyone even approached us (after being seated). That aside service was good - efficient and friendly. (Some evidently still in training servers could use some more training but that was more endearing than annoying). Service gets 4 stars.

Decor: To each his own but for me the decor was in poor taste and a little confused in parts - large awkward wine cellar like structure in the middle, a wooden reindeer of sorts in one corner, and mirrors above some of the seating. That said the room was large and didn't feel crowded or sound noisy which was nice. I give decor a 2.

Overall (mostly weighted on the food): I wouldn't recommend the tasting menu for the price or the experience. It wasn't bad, but that's not what you look for when you shell out the $$$.I can't speak for the a la carte.
