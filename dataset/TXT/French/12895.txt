4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Mon Ami Gabi is a nice little place located right in front of the Bellagio under the eiffel tower.  The interior is decorated with beautiful, dark wood that mimics Parisian cafes.

It is perfect for brunch. We went a little before ten and we're thrown off by the huge line in front of the restaurant. But the line moved very fast and in a short minute or two we were at the front. The outside seating was full but they sat us inside right away. 

The eggs benedict was deliciously crafted.  The muffin was crunchy on the outside, giving the dish an interesting texture. The waffles my sister had were also just as delicious: sweet and decadent!

For brunch,  the prices were completely do-able compared to other places in Vegas (40$ breakfast, I think not) and the food/ambiance were very nice!
