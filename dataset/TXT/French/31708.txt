gpY1RzC3aAPTqsx27GMtsw My favorite thing was the name....that is all. 

No, but seriously the service and atmosphere are nice. We felt like we were tucked in a small brasserie in Paris. 

The bad...the meal unfortunately nowhere close to the dedicate flavors I would expect from a French restaurant. The ravioli was very garlic heavy and the Bavette was very salty. It was just not very good. For context it was 9:30 when we arrived and the kitchen closed at 10:00 so maybe it wasn't there best night because they wanted us out, I'm not sure.

The reason I gave it 2 stars versus 1 star is it has potential and maybe they had a bad night. Otherwise I would give it 1 star. If you go, play it safe with drinks and sides as snacking food versus a dinner.
