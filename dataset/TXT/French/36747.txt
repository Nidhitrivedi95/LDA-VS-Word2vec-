iEsNloJgy-MyA-_wqeB6jg Love this place! The food was excellent, the atmosphere quaint (kinda like finding a mom and pop place in Europe) and the service was amazing!! And yes, as many have mentioned, the soufflé was amazing!! The owner/chef came out and greeted us and ended up spending some time telling us the story of the place! Been open 21 yrs! We will be back!
