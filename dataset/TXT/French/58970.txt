Great way to start off our Vegas vacation. After reading reviews online, we decided to try Le Cirque in the Bellagio. We were seated on time and promptly welcomed by the wait staff. 

We both decided to get the Prix Fixe menu ($105/person), which includes an appetizer, entree and any one dessert. The Sommelier assisted us in picking a bottle of wine in a friendly and informative matter. 

We were provided an Amuse-bouche of salmon, which was fresh and delicious. The meal only got better. Each course was described to us and was as delicious as they sounded. The escargot was amazing - as well as the lamb. 

Save room for dessert as well, the souffle was great, as well as the chocolate sphere. 

Definitely would recommend for a nice dinner in Vegas!
