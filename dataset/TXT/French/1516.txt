0B_aEPeZjrXs6T7vS3arrA I don't really have to much to say about Sophie's.  The food wasn't bad, the service wasn't horrible... it's just that my overall experience wasn't what I'd have expected from a restaurant that touts such an amazing reputation for fine French cuisine.  It's not often I leave a place so hungry for the experience I didn't get to have.  . Again, the food was not bad, but I'm not sure If I will ever be back.
