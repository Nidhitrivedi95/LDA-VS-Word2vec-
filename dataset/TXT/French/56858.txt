rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Excellent, excellent. This place is great. Once you enter the restuarant from the private elevator, you are greeted with the fresh, crisp atmosphere of Bouchon. 

The food, cocktails, wine staff and service was excellent!

Once seated after a quick cocktail and appetizer at the bar, we were presented with a neatly folded paper menu with french bistro style fare. 

The seafood appetizer of fresh shrimp, oysters on the halfshell, crab and lobster was elegantly presented in a four tier iced platter. The sommeiler was well informed and very professional. Main course was excellent with the special of the day (fish) was cooked perfect. All other dishes where perfectly presented and very tasty.

The service was excellent and left you feeling like a millionaire -- even though you just lost $200 at the craps table before dinner...

Definitely a place to visit again when in Vegas.
