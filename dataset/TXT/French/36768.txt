iEsNloJgy-MyA-_wqeB6jg Went here for my birthday and wasn't disapponted.  The place is small and quaint, but with old-school waiter service rarely seen anymore.  We started with the escargot for me and watercress soup for my hubs.  Both were phenominal.  I then had the seafood trio (lobster, scallop and shrimp) flambe tableside which was also very good and a generous portion.  Hubs got the veal marsala which was ok, and a small portion (good thing I had seafood to spare).  We finished with a strawberry tart for him and cheesecake for me, both were great and I'm not a huge cheesecake fan, but I finished all of this one!  Cons for us was that for a french restaurant the wine list was small and uninspired, the vegetable was preactically nonexistant, and the bread was pretty blah.  Yes, it is pricy, but good for a special occasion and something different.
