4O8fzz9F-XEsQ-gTMgkiyQ We stayed in a Hotel on Rue Saint Paul We passed by Les Pyrenees a few times.  In the late 70s I travelled  quite a lot to northern Spain so on a whim we gave Les Pyrenees a try. Boy were we disappointed. I had the seafood soup which pureed. Total lack of seasoning or seafood taste. My wife had the scallops which were presented well but lacked any flavor. We finished with the Paella. One beautiful langoustine  which was so over cooked I could not extract the meat from the shell.The rice chorizo and various seafood was extremely greasy.
Way over priced. Only good thing we found sandwich shop next door where we bought fare for our trip home to Toronto. Best baguette and ham I have ever had outside Paris and an incredible staff.
