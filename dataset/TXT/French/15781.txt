6GCbZASjMnAPYBWLc_z30g I used to really enjoy Mimi's but then they changed the menu.  No more Albacore and Avacado sandwich..  :(  Had the streak salad instead and it was a disaster.  Who puts deep fried cheese balls on a salad?  They do now.  Service was also one step behind Denny's.  

Another restraunt who switched from good food to cheap food and kept the prices high.
