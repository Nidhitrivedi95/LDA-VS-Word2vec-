hzyvL2v97xLzLbLXcdi1uw Cafe moulin was pretty tasty but overpriced. I ordered the walnut street crepe which I enjoyed and my husband ordered a savory crepe that he said was okay. The trick to the best deal is to come here when you're craving a sweet breakfast I would say. The Nutella hot chocolate was sinful. I will definitely be going back to try some more!
