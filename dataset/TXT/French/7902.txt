4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw There's really one thing that makes this place - the patio, which is right across the street from the Bellagio. It's a perfect dining spot. The one thing to keep in mind is that the patio is first come/first served, so you may want to stop by just before (or as) they open if you don't want to sit around waiting.

Fortunately, the food is also very tasty. Both times I've been there I had some form of a steak, which, of course, is served with fries. The fries are cut very thin, very crispy, a tad on the greasy side, and oh so very tasty. Spend the extra few dollars for the filet rather than going with the normal strip steak they serve.

The service is very solid - very good, quasi-high class but not snooty.

And for the location and food I think the prices are rock solid. Just a few dollars more than the Outback down the street.

Whenever people ask where to have dinner in Vegas I always recommend this place.
