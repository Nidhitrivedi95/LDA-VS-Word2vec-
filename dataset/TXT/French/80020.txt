ZuYsZvJ5r32Fs70vPXbRgw So this is my first review on my new account..last account got lost..don't ask. Anyway, Celestine. .great little place nestled in an old bank on Mt. Pleasant road.  French style bistro and a great menu. I tried the braised rabbit and it was great! Just the right amount of cooking  made the meat nice and tender , our party also had the meat and cheese platter to finish. Wine selection is good but where they really shine is the cocktails. If you like your coctails, you have to try the  sazarac.  Great place for a date or a nice dinner but you don't have to fight the traffic downtown. Cheers!
