Tl2nqtPXlLbAG3qkUYVM2g Amazing... Totally amazing. The raisin bread and croissant were two of the best breads I've had. Wonderful scallops. Soup wasn't listed as cold and although the taste was good I didn't like the temperature. Service was amazing!! Desert was to die (we had ice cream in some type of bread). Only 4 stars because there were no vegan or vegetarian entree options.
