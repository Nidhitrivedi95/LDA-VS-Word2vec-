Onions? sure, they have them, sautéed in pork fat and slathered in butter.
Potatoes? yep, a decent amount of them as well, covered in gravy and mashed with...bacon grease? butter? I'm not entirely sure, but it's something delicious. 

Foie gras aux pommes ($26): amazing. Although I prefer my dishes a little more savory, the flavors mixed together sublimely, and the balsamic reduction paired like heaven.

Carpaccio de canard (I think around $14): also delicious. Mustard + raw duck + green onion + olive oil = nom. 

Potée du PDC ($22): dear lord. one human being should not have access to this much pork. Or to this many forms of pork. Fantastic, but seriously sweating pork for the next few days.

Tarte de boudin ($17): I ate ONE slice of the boudin that night. Not to say it wasn't good, just by this point I had OD'd on pork. We took the rest home, and it made a wonderful snack on the train the next day. The boudin itself is melt-in-your-mouth soft, and the mustard that they both bake into it and garnish it with is divine.

So glad they had beer ($5ish a pint) to wash down all the grease!
