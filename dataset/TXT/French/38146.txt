JezHN-9KKLTMbojq00VP0g Sunday Morning we call the restaurant we speak to a very nice lady that tells us to come in just two in our party she said should be no problem. We arrive the tall guy says to us sorry we are full you can come back at 11:45, when indeed it was clear to see their were 10 tables open and  no wait line. A bad call indeed a great way for customers never to return! Shame on you! I gave one star for the nice lady on the phone, however, they should hang a sign that reads "reservations only for breakfast, any empty table means it's reserved!"Your loss!
