P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ It's been quite sometime since I've ate here (probably about 2 years).  But it is one of the most epic meals I've had.  My parents brought me to this place for a birthday.  We had the pre-coursed meal... Everything was amazing.  Probably the best french restaurant in Vegas.  Just wishing he would open a joint near me!
