6fPQJq4f_yiq1NHn0fd11Q Fast, friendly service and a little crepe stand inside the Paris hotel. Good amount of sweet and savory options. Cute chalkboard menu to peruse. Reasonably priced, for the portion you're getting. And when plated, it looks beautiful and decadent. Can get a small discount if you're a Total Rewards member.  Everything fresh and made to order. And a large and very filling crepe! 

Hazelnut/banana - I thoroughly enjoyed this hearty crepe and by the time I finished, I was stuffed! Full of banana chunks and generous layer of Nutella. Every bite was oozing with it, and the light, airy cream complimented the crepe perfectly. Comes with candied hazelnuts but I nixed that. $11

Blueberry lemon - giant blueberries on top of the crepe! Looked so fresh and delicious. No mushy blueberries here. But my husband was not a fan of this crepe, because of the lemon curd filling. There was no texture, and to him it seemed a bit gooey. He said the crepe itself was tasty and was not overly sweet. $11.25

We took ours to-go. The girl taking our order was very pleasant. The girl forgot this, but easily popped a lid onto our plate. Utensils and napkins to the side! 

If there was a small line, it often moved very quickly.
