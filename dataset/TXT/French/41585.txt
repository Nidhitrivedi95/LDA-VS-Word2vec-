kKC7UTcHZM3zLfT97x3msg Definitely a spot for special occasions, unless of course if you've got the dough.

We were late half hour for our reservation (*rolls eyes*), but they kept our table and was very nice about it. We just had to eat fast.

- homemade bread and hummus dip - Amazing! the bread was fresh and warm. hummus was oily and flavourful. I hate it when place give out gross store bough hard bread.

- corn soup with goat cheese fritter - YUMMY! The fritter of course. The corn soup was just OK.

- two courses down and we haven't even ordered anything yet.
  We got a bottle of McMannis Pinot Noir... received a bottle of Cab Sauv instead. The bartender should really pay more attention next time....

- finally, real food: appetizers:
1. tuna tartare: Good. Fresh, tasty. Worked really well with the avocado and a side salad. 
2. Lobster ravioli: DELICIOUS! big chunks of lobster, simple yet tasty tomato based broth. one of the best ravioli i've had.
3. oyster rockefeller: can't come here and not try it. It was amazing! Though I knew with all the hollandaise sauce it's probably a very fatty dish, I was enjoying it too much to care. 

- here comes the sorbet between our courses. Nice and cold and sour.....

- main course:
1. I got the lamb. It was good! very tender. but nothing too special about it. 
2. No he didn't! ..my friend got another dozen of the oyster Rockefeller! LOL. SO GOOD!

- dessert: chocolate cake and i had the black plum tart tatin with chai tea ice cream. It was really good. many different texture from the cold ice cream to the warm fruit. YUM.

- last but not the least, how can we forget the homemade  chocolate truffle that came with the bill? :)

Will go back for sure.
