b3wgQ6CccBO8fgvlbS0M1Q Took my mother newly in town to check out Morning Squeeze Saturday morning, but was expecting the line that we saw out front. Decided to look elsewhere but as we turned the corner, voila! A little pastry/breakfast place, and got rock star parking. Only two of the dozen or so tables were occupied. Although I am not a big fan of the over-enthusiastic greeting, I would have liked a little more "thanks for coming in!", but we were sat promptly. Coffee was good, omelette was DELICIOUS, fresh fruit and berries topped with just enough whipped cream and powered sugar, and the almond croissant was the best ever. You have to request water, though. I would definitely go back here anytime. A  secret find! Tell your friends, excellent pastries to go. Looks like they have a wine license as well.
