EukD4hlPZXgSMpeya5iX2g We are new to the neighbourhood and tried Chez Laurent on a recommendation. A cozy little war home on Yonge Street (we are told, the only house on this section of Yonge), it really feels like walking into somebody's house. Not a great place for big gatherings, but perfect to share an intimate meal.

The service was reasonably good, and the owner was present and attended the table often. We ordered wine at the beginning of the meal, but it never came and we felt bad about demanding it and were largely indifferent to having it. I brought it to the owner's attention at the end of the meal and she was extremely apologetic and accommodating.

As for the food, it was spectacular. I had the french onion soup, which was unusually sweet, easily had a whole spanish onion sliced into it, and lots of melted cheese. It was delicious, but was nearly a meal in and of itself. I had the veal cannelloni, which was the pasta dish of the day. It was very good, but a bit dry inside. The pasta was homemade and fantastic though, and the sauce complemented the dish very well, but I had just enough for one of the two pieces.

For dessert, we shared the lemon ice cream, which was light, but substantial, and entirely refreshing, with a crispy, crumbly crust. I would highly recommend closing the meal with this refreshing treat!

I will definitely return, but would try a different dish, and likely pass on the overly filling appetizer.
