jLxeBgWhLRbII2ACkgH1Sg This is my favorite place for breakfast pastries. I'm a fan of almond croissants and the one here is the best I've had. The chocolate almond croissant is even better if you've got a craving for sweets like I do. It's got enough chocolate to satisfy that morning craving, but subtle enough so you won't regret it. The pain au chocolat ($2.70) and apple turnover ($2.70) are great too -- light, buttery and flakey.

I'm not as crazy about the sandwiches. The rustic sandwich was too much bread and not enough filling. It was pretty good on that rare bite when you get the perfect ratio of ingredients in one bite, but more often than not each bite was nothing but bread.

Still, I love this place. It's the best spot in the area for a quick morning bite.
