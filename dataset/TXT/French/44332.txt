ME6D5nLlfG0xZCtICOYDuw Dinner for four during restaurant week went quite well. She crab soup was quite good as was the braised short rib entree.   Would have tried the beet salad but was not on the fixed menu.  Service was excellent.  Rock music in the background did not quite fit the decor or clientele.
