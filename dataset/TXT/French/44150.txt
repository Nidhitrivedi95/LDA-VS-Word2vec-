MdjIl105vqCYUGKFSUVytA I had reserved this restaurant on Opentable weeks ago, to celebrate a special occasion with my family. We arrived at our reservation time of 12:30 on a Sunday.  I was told by the hostess that our table would soon be ready.  I sat down with the other members of my party and waited. After 15 minutes the manager came over and apologized but did not suggest how much longer we might be waiting--no offer of a glass of wine, prosecco or anything while we waited. I asked if I could have a coffee--never came. Another 10 minutes passed and my adult daughter went to the hostess and asked when we would be seated and they said we were next on the "list"! My daughter rightfully angry, replied that we should not have been on a waiting list-we had a bona fide reservation. We could see a table for four that was empty and was being cleaned and still held a hope that they would tell us that we were to be taken to the table imminently.  Instead they had the gall to seat a newly arrived group of 3 people who arrived around the same time as my daughter's complaint. At 1pm, outraged with what had occurred I stopped at the hostess desk on my way out to complain and she said that she had to do what the manager told her to do.  He was nowhere in sight as we departed, but I did return in a few minutes later when I saw him at the desk, to let him know how pathetic his management was. 
He returned a very feeble apology and promised to seat me THEN???! 
I think not, I think never.
