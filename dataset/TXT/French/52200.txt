Considering this was during a slow lunch, waiting 10 minutes for the server to come over and introduce herself was a bit ridiculous. We ordered the calamari as an appetizer, which comes with a tomato sauce on the side. When we finally got our appetizer, there was no sauce. I asked the waitress (who I will not name) if it came with the marinara sauce. She gave us a curt, "no, it's not served with anything." And then asked if we would like ranch to dip the calamari in. I grabbed a menu, just to make sure that I hadn't read anything wrong, and sure enough it says that the calamari was served with a warm pomodoro sauce. I got another waiter's attention to get the sauce (after ours ignored my attempts to get her attention), and our waitress got very snotty and butted in. All we wanted was the sauce that was served with our appetizer... The salads we ordered were good, and after we got a little rude with the waitress, she spent the rest of our meal trying to make up for her rudeness. 
I will not be returning to this location.
