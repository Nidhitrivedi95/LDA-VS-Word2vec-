8ciT6qjI18x9EPtOb-gqYQ We would consider coup des tartes one of the best restaurants we have been to in phoenix.  

The ambiance is charming, the service is unobtrusive, a wonderful place for date.

We have been three times and never left disappointed.  Anything with a tart will be amazing (both sweet and savory).  The lobster parpadelle was fantastic and brie brulee is a delicious meal in itself.  The other entrees we have had were defitely above average.

We love the byob aspect, but in reference to a recent post, I belive the corkage is not $18 but $9.

I would highly recommend this place to anyone.
