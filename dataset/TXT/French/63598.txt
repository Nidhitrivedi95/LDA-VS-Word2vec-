t1mR_Zff6Dqv1TueE2JLEA Arrived for dinner in the early evening. Waited approximately 20 minutes to receive proper menus, after deciding to forego the Summerlicious prix-fixe menus. Waited nearly about hour after finishing our meals for the bill. Though our table was on the main thoroughfare of the restaurant, our server was seemingly actively ignoring my table. None of the servers were cheerful, and indeed it seemed some were participating in heated exchanges in the kitchen, as seen through the kitchen doors.

Our table, the dishes, silverware, and decor were all covered in varying levels of muck, that was readily apparent by sight or touch. Restaurant is rather dimly lit, with too many pillows, curtains, and other decorations strewn about. Our table featured a severe wobble and nearly resulted in spilled drinks multiple times. 

Dishes came out in reasonable time, tasted okay, and were an acceptable size. Altogether not worth the hefty price asked.
