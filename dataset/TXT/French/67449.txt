UWupVhvb1qWZh8rNowJliQ Went for a celebratory dinner - service and food were very good. We started with cocktails, following with a nice red wine. Both of us had appetizers and mains - neither I nor my sister had any complaints. Food was flavourful, well presented and I don't think either one of us had anything left on our plates. I highly recommend Woods!
