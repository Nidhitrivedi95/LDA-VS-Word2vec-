rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w I have always heard of the Le Cirque in NY but haven't gone yet. The one in Vegas was A+! The decor of the dining area was beautiful, the ceiling has pieces of colorful fabric artfully draped on the ceiling, meeting in the center. You have a great view of the water show that goes on every 15 minutes in Lake Bellagio. The food is divine and they give very generous portions. I was full after my lobster salad appetizer. Which was so delicous I inhaled it. I then had to try to dig into my beef tenderloin with foie gras on top but I could only manage to eat half of it. It was good, big piece of meat, I was just too full. But I had to make room for dessert. We all got different items. The best one was the tropical one served in a coconut shell. The flavors in there were just so well married together. It was bursting with flavors and just so pleasing to the palette. I have never tasted anything like it before! We had an exceptional meal here. It was definitely memorable and now I can't wait to go to the one in NY!
