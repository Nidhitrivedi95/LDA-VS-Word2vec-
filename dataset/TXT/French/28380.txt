EEIz44ewHhOKmfTloAK13g There is a review here by Keith C where he refers to a "heavier set Indian guy who is always eating by himself" every Saturday night - Not true, I'm only here about every three weeks or so :)

Absolutely superb - I've had dinner both in the dining room (once, and then again at a private wine tasting event), but all other times at the Chef's counter.

I rarely, if ever, rate a restaurant at 5 stars - however, Alo deserves it for every facet of their execution.  The service is superlative, the food is inventive, delicious and the ambience is perfect without being neither overly casual nor stuffy.

I always do the wine pairings and the wine service - right from the beginning with Anjana Viswanathan (who opened the place), then Toni and Christopher - is always interesting and well matched.  A superb match that has not changed much from the start is the Pain Au Lait (milk bread) with fleur de sel matched with Madeira.  That is a match made in heaven.

Patrick Kriss (Chef) and Amanda Bradley (GM) have created a gem of a place in the unlikeliest of places.  Kudos on a superb job.
