4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw How can you not love this place??!! This is in my top three restaurants in Las Vegas. We have eaten here maybe 5 or 6 times and each time has been wonderful. Some of the best service we've had. Last time or server was a older gentleman with a heavy French accent. Very friendly and accommodating to some things that we ordered that were not on the menu. 

We've had steaks, white fish (light breading), salmon, crepes, salads, and this last time an omelet. All of it has been great. I'm not a big "Frites" fan and so I usually substitute mashed potatoes. I learned this last time that the potatoes are so good because of all the cream and butter that goes into it. Good for you....No. Great tasting....absolutely! 

The atmosphere is fantastic with the Bellagio fountain show directly across the street. At night you can see the shows every 15 minutes. The restaurant itself is very classy looking and romantic. It has the look - and location- of an expensive place but the prices are surprisingly moderate - steaks in the low 20's, fish in the high teens and lunch crepes with a salad for about $12.

Oh, and not to be gross, be sure to check out the restrooms just behind the restaurant.  They have a recording playing of pick up lines and things you'll hear at the Paris.  It's English, then translated into French.  It is quit funny and amusing.  I learned how to say: "If you were a sandwich, you'd be a Mc-Babe with Cheese." and "Your father must have been a baker, 'cause you've got nice buns".  So, if I ever go to France, I'll have some French under my belt.   Hey!! That sounds like a pick up line right there!!
