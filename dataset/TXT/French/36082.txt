hzyvL2v97xLzLbLXcdi1uw I came on a Tuesday morning. There was no wait and the service was very attentive and friendly. The atmosphere was nice, they were playing jazz music which I enjoyed. 

I ordered the Bristol crepe with the sausage on the side. It was very good and filling. My latte was amazing!

Next time I will try the Turkish coffee, my waitress offered to read my fortune in the espresso grounds :)
