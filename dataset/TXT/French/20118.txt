aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw Just like Fauchon in Paris (France, not the hotel in Vegas).... Bouchon in Vegas has proven itself to me the company's true understanding of fine bakery/patisserie.  

It could be as simple as a plain croissant and a cup of coffee.  They know how to do it right.  The melt-in-your-mouth texture of the croissant had me go back to Bouchon twice within the span of 3 hours.  THAT good, yes.  

Also, props to its convenient location - just at the entrance to the adjoining Sands Expo Center.  A great quick stop to start off your full day at the conference/convention/etc with a lovely breakfast.  Also great for snacks and quick, grab-and-go lunch fixes.  


Now, I just need to fly out to Paris to revisit the exquisite Fauchon....
