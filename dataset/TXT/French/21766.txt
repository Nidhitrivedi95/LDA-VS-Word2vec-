Bf-yMQiSmDZyqfGyFKQ0bA Stopped in before a concert in Homestead. Met by friendly server who told me about happy hour (half off draughts!)
Despite getting busy, server was attentive, friendly, on top of drinks (beer and water refills) and the food was pretty good!
The beer selection was incredible and the prices were reasonable for the quality of the beer. Then, there was the happy hour so it was very inexpensive. Incredible first experience there, will be heading to Homestead just to go there.
