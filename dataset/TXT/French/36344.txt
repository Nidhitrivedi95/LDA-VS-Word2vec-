I2LcbNXGsMb6zxh4-gmVHw Surprisingly delicious and authentic. I had the roast pork sandwich. The pork was appropriately fatty, sweet, flavorful, and had enough tooth to make the sandwich a treat. The veggies were well pickled, perhaps cut a bit large, but the homemade mayonnaise brought it all together. The non-Vietnamese sweet potato fries that I chose as a side were well done and were well matched with a chile/aioli (??) dipping sauce. The bread also was well done, fresh and crunchy without being crumbly. 

The ambience is a bit less Asian themed than one would expect, way too loud and cold (I suspect they decided they could do away with meat coolers if they keep the temp at 37), but the staff was very attentive and pleasant. 

Turn down the house music a bit and I'd happily return with coworkers for lunch.
