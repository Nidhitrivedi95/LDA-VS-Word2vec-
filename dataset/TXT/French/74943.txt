Xz2GP6UPMQu22EB_76nZKw Decent prices, decent selection of beer accompanied with a good decor. The dance floor is a bit cramped up but they made a good use of the space available.

Avoid Fridays at all cost. FILLED to the brim with 18-19 year old obnoxiously loud and clumsy Abbott students.

Avoid one of the bartenders as there are some that are apparently pricks and will treat you like garbage because he disagrees with you on said-and-said subject, like for instance giving a tip only if the service is appropriate. Apparently you must give a fat tip to a server (or in this case a busboy) even if the quality of the service provided was garbage. Don't believe me? Have some proof:

I will not be going to this pub anymore as this is not the kind of service I desire.
