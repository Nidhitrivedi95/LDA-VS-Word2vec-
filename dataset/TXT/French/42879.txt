LnSjzFXh1GrOObsRP6LhBQ I go to Brioche 1-2 times weekly, it's pretty close to my work and offers up a pretty decent latte, and really good lunch options.  Their Beet and Goat Cheese salad is amazing and actually quite filling.
3 stars because:
-the customer service is quite poor, no one is particularly friendly or helpful, a lot of the time one will direct you to another staff member, who will just stare at you until you talk
-the food is very pricey for the portion size
-the line-up area is very confusing; if you just go in for a coffee and go right up to the till, there's a moment of awkward limbo between you and a someone who is waiting for their food to be plated, but is ready to pay.
After visiting Paris last fall, it was neat to come home and see Brioche, as it is like 'the Starbucks of Paris'.  They do prepare the food almost in the exact same way, which was quite nostalgic.  Over all, very tasty, but could use a bit of work!
