Kut9tVbDX_f7qKMRRoXg3w I love this place.  The only things that are keeping me from giving it 5 stars are that they've cut down on their portions (especially the sides) and how cramped it gets inside.

The food is to die for, I make a point of coming here every time I'm in Montreal.  It's best for breakfast on off-weeekends, because it just gets too busy.

The croque madame and monsieur are worth every cent, they are so fresh. 

The decor is super cozy and warm, I love the atmosphere and ambiance.  

Never had anything but excellent service.
