If you come during peak hours on the weekend, expect a long wait for a table, hurried service, and feeling like you're being rushed to get out of there. However, come during off hours on a weekday and you'll get a relaxing meal in a great atmosphere

I've had both the savory and sweet crepes here, and particularly love the Black Forest one. This is a great place to come with a friend and split two crepes to get a taste for both the savory and sweet ones. The portions are fine for someone my size, but can see them being a little underwhelming for someone with a big appetite.

All in all, a good choice on Craig Street. Just try to avoid it on the weekends
