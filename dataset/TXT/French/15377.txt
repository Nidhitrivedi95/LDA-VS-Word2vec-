6fPQJq4f_yiq1NHn0fd11Q Crepe again?  What is wrong with me?

I went to Paris hotel to try its crepe.  I remember getting the crepe many moons ago but it was just okay.

Got crepe toulouse.  It's crepe with marinara sauce with sausage and some other meats.  It was good.  

3 stars!!

La Creperie is kinda yummylicious!!
