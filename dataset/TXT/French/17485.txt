9mG2yOnHtxVPEM1p8FqycA I used to come to this restaurant a LOT when I attended Marianopolis College and McGill U, from 1978-1983. This was my go-to place for croissants and coffee back in the day, when it was called "La Croissanterie" (no "Figro" in the name). I was SO relieved to see that the place was still here, on the same corner, with the same kind of Parisienne vibe, and the same cute outdoor terasse. 

The interior has changed somewhat (I remember it being larger, and more open, but hey, we're going back over 30 years). The food is as wonderful as I remember! Brought my kids here today and we sat outside. The kids had croissants - one regular, one chocolate. They were both in heaven. One kid had a pot of tea and the other, hot chocolate. Again, both were very happy with their beverages. I ordered quiche Lorraine and man, it was good. Can't really get legit quiche in Seattle, and it was a real treat for me. My kids tried it and loved it. And I had my old Montreal standby: cafe au lait, in a bowl. Man, it's good to be back home! Don't want to leave....  (It's really good to have some things the same, as I remember them, as so much in the city has changed, and not all for the better....). 

Our waitress we had was lovely, and she was happy to speak in English to us.

Note: the bathroom in the rear of the restaurant is beyond tiny. Cute, but if you need any room, for any reason, forget about it.
