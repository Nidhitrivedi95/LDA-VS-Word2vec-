u-SvRRAfYgpbXZRfQgcTzA Incredible space and pretty good food. I've got to admit that the ambience in this place is electric - it's noisy and face-paced! One thing you can always count on is the constant banging of tables for the sake bombs. This place is great for groups or parties. The food is pretty good but not the best Japanese food that I've had in Montreal.

Go for the black cod, dumplings and shrimp! Avoid the noodles - they are nothing special and my group was slightly disappoint with their lack of flavour.
