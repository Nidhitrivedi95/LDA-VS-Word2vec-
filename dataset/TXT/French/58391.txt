rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I would say that my experience was somewhat disappointing. It's not bad, just not Thomas Keller quality. 

The atmosphere of this place is just swanky. Glossy tile, brass, and wood. That's my favorite part!

Came here for brunch yesterday by myself and sat at the bar. Bar was more interested in opening than acknowledging me, and the rest of my experience came across this way, save one of the girls that refilled my coffee (which is really great coffee, by the way.

Ordered the Croque Madame as everyone suggested. I'm confused why everyone adores it so much. It's a $19 grilled cheese with an egg on top with some nice, crisp frites.. It was burned around the edges (not toasted... Downright charred), and the bartender tried justifying it as "well done." It was good, not great. 

I would come back here though for dinner to give them a solid college try. The atmosphere is whimsical and great, and sitting on the patio is a great idea.
