FJMMPL3pxAPYGEPB0Hwlhw I came here last weekend for the Sunday Buffet brunch. Service was great, they refill your unlimited Bellini/ mimosa constantly (+1 bonus point)

The antipasto and seafood bar was fresh, if you love oysters, you'll be in heaven. The cheese bar was lacking.The pastries looked store bought/dry. The pancakes were delicious, very fluffy.
Cold appetizers - unique and tasty, presentation was nice but i wish there was more variety. The hot entrees ...not my favourite section - chicken was dry and tasteless, the fish - same thing. The dessert section: the creme brulee and pana cotta was delicious!! Macaroons didn't taste fresh.

Overall, i don't think i would go back for a while. The food was simple, there were a few unique pieces but i couldn't get over the price. After tips and tax, you're looking at over $100 per person. Maybe if you stuff yourself with 100 oysters, it's worth it.
