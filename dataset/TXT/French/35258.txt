Ht-_i0UAq7YDBaqJwcQMdQ A terrific experience! An unconventional space with a unique decorating style, but overall great food in an unpretentious environment.

The service was stellar - our waiter was friendly, helpful, and extremely knowledgeable. Also quite supportive with the somewhat intimidating wine list. The entire team worked together well, and it's clear that the staff enjoys their work.

Our meals were nothing short of fantastic - the food was fresh and ingredients delicious, and the combination of tastes were well considered. The presentation could possibly have been more attractive, but in all, there was nothing to complain about with this meal from savory start to sweet finish. The recommended wine was a perfect choice based on our food selection - kudos to our waiter for his suggestion of an organic French Pinot Noir, delicate but delicious. Thanks as well for the gratis taste of a plum brandy after the meal - a very nice and unexpected surprise that added another great taste to the experience.

The music was perfect and added to the overall vibe - dub and trip hop - lending a somewhat dreamy atmosphere to the windowless but cozy den of a dining room.

I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for excellent food in an unorthodox but comfortable and easy-to-enjoy space.
