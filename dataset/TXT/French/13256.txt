4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw This place is perfect! We ordered the original steak herb and butter with mashed potatoes instead of their fried potato strings at no extra cost. The steak was seasoned and cooked perfectly. The view was a great compliment to the meal also. Everyone was very polite and made sure our drinks were always full. The only thing i noticed was that they forgot to give us the balsamic vinegar and oil for our bread but it really wasnt a big deal. I'm really suprised about the price for our meal, it wasn't ridiculously priced at all. Usually you get what you pay for but in this case its not true. Definitely going to be a regular for us!
