jLxeBgWhLRbII2ACkgH1Sg I stopped by to grab some latte before work and some cheese Danish. Even grabbed a few canele's for some coworkers. 

Wish they warmed the Danish, but that's alright. We have a microwave and I'm sure if I didn't take it to go they'd warm it up. 

That Danish was sweet and scrumptious! It was pretty large in size too. YUM. The caramel latte was perfect and the canele was fantastic. 

This was just a quick trip and I'm convinced I have to try other noms there! There was so much to choose from that it took me a minute. Next time I go there, I want to try their quiche and their crepes. *heart eyes*
