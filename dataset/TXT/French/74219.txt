xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g Was there on the Fourth of July, the ladies upfront  could be friendlier, but I loved the food and our waiters.  Especially the beet salad.  It was excellent!!! Dessert was great, out of all the restaurants we went to in Vegas this one was my favorite.  If u r in Vegas, don't miss out.
