ZdaZwXC0FByDY3EwNELphw I ordered the frittata for brunch, it is an Italian egg based dish similar to a quiche. It came on a bed of salad and a hash.

I didn't really enjoy the frittata; I think the chef may have put a bit too much salt in my dish, because it was very very salty. It was interesting because the top part of the frittata was delicious, but the base of it was too salty. I also like how there were some jalapeño slices on top of the frittata to give it another texture as well as taste. I thought the hash was made perfectly and it tasted really well, and the salad help accompanied the frittata.

My friends ordered other dishes (such as the Benny) and really liked it. I will consider going again, but will not be ordering the frittata.
