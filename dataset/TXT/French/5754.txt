3jKUbhGSjFTv5jZ0wnW0xA What a lovely bistro located in a very quaint street...however, parking was a b*tch though as it's really close to the residential area...don't forget to read the parking rules, or else you'll get a ticket.

Walked in on a Friday evening and was promptly seated by Camille, who was also our waitress for the night. A big shout out to Camille who made our evening so enjoyable. For appetizer, the hubby and I ordered the escargot (a bit bland) and foie gras (yummy!!!!). For entree, he had the flank steak while I got the duck confit. Oh my, my duck confit was cooked to perfection. Just the right amount of flavor and the meat is falling off the bone tender. I really liked it that the entree also came with a salad which helped cut down the richness of the meal. I am normally not a fan of potatoes (except for fries) but the scalloped potato accompanied with the meal was just out of this world. I ate every piece of it. Portion size is generous. I loved my dish so much that I didn't even taste my hubby's steak (which he said was really delicious). We were too full for dessert so I just had my chamomile tea to round out the night. A very reasonably priced restaurant, will definitely be back on my next trip to Montreal.
