htQgj-ANQpZGpIpkkrEmyQ We came here for friend's birthday dinner. it is my first time here and I was surprised to find a cute little asian/fusion restaurant located in markham Mainstreet. It is not really a 'stand out' kind of restaurant when you pass by. It is quite small when you go in. it has 2 large table for bigger parties (we had a party size of 7) and a few small tables on the side. It is no wonder you'll need reservation because this place will get crowded. 

As a usual yelper, I would read all the reviews to see what to order. 
My review is based on my own personal dishes that I ordered (Which I absolutely enjoyed). Other dishes were complete misses for me --- so I probably wouldn't come for awhile

I really enjoyed the UDON carbonara - it was chewy, flavourful and very filling. 
Enjoyed the duck fat fries! Who doesn't??! 
Also enjoyed an appetizer we shared, the Scotch egg! REally lovely batter surrounding the egg and a nice way to share and start the dinner. 

Since it was a birthday gathering, we ordered all the desserts to try. Some were beautifully and creatively plated and served. However, I don't remember too much about the overall taste.

I did not like the chicken and waffle. The taste of the chicken had a hint of spices that reminds me of curry. It is not the typical flavour of chicken and waffle that makes it go well together. It was also very dry chicken as well. A little too dry for my liking.
