gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA Amazing views! Maybe the best of the strip. Alize is located at the top of the Palms. 

I had the Ahi Tuna (which was amazing), but the Dover Sole was the plate another guest got and it was even better! Salads were incredible. Escargot was great! 

The area had a relaxing and pleasant atmosphere and the service was great!
