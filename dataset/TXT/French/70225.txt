x_1Yo9ArcbitR6NQC7tOUA Cute little restaurant along the Bloor strip. Decided to walk in for brunch today after discovering massive line ups at our usual spots. We sat right along the window which is great for a coffee and people watching. Server was friendly but not overly attentive. Ordered the pulled pork hash and was sadly disappointed. Portion size was good and potatoes were really tasty however just found the dish dry and a little bland. Wish I could say better things about this little cutie but unfortunately this place won't be added to the brunch hot spots.
