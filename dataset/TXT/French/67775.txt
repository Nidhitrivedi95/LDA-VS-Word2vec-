UxWH8zRYIBgs6Q2oykvRdw enjoyed a lovely lunch - the starter "warm squash salad" is delicious, needs a more evocative name!  Very attractive in its presentation as well.  The lovely staff treated me to a free dessert with candle & decoration in honour of my birthday -- that was SO NICE!  Decor is interesting, lots to look at, not overdone.  and at lunch, the acoustics were GREAT ... had a good conversation.  My one mistake - I didn't try the frites, which looked delicious at other people's tables.  Gotta go back!
