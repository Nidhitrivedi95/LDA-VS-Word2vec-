1aj4TG0eFq6NaPBKk6bK7Q Delicious food, beautiful atmosphere, reasonably priced and friendly staff. I highly recommend! The hours of operation are the downfall. I want breakfast before 11 a.m. on the weekends. It also closes too early on weekend nights. I live within walking distance and I'd love to walk there with my neighbors/friends weekend mornings or evenings, sip bottomless mimosas, Bloody Mary's or wine, eat a delicious breakfast or dinner, and enjoy conversation.
