4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw We have been here about 10 times and it is a must when we are in Las Vegas. Yesterday my wife had the seafood crepe and I had the steak sandwich. both we excellent as was the service. The steak sandwich is actually roast beef that is quite tender and the bread it is on is to die for. Sit on the patio, it is worth the wait.
