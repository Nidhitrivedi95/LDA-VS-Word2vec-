This is the 4th French restaurant I tried in Montreal, and I do think it's the best one, at least out of the 4 I tried. I really like the ambience and setting of this restaurant, given the location in Old Montreal. It really does give the French-style dining feel that's quite common in these kinds of restaurants. 

There are three types of menus here: A la carte, table d'hote, and the tasting menu. Unlike many reviews here, I actually went with a la carte...not a fan of the whole tasting menu concept, and I do have an okay idea of what to expect for French cuisine.

My family ordered the french onion soup, lobster bisque, smoked duck breast, escargots, vanilla flavoured shrimp, rack of lamb, and the veal chop. We finished off with a chocolate chip soufflé and a cheesecake.

Where do I start...for the soups, the lobster bisque is definitely strong in the lobster fragrance category. I felt the taste was a bit light, but nothing too terrible about it. The french onion soup isn't the type with baked cheese on top, so do keep that in mind. I'd stick with the lobster bisque next time. Smoked duck breast, escargots, and vanilla flavoured shrimp were all uniquely presented and equally delicious. The rack of lamb was grilled perfectly, while the veal chop was a little bit more rare than what we requested (medium rare vs. medium).

The desserts are a must here. Both the cheesecake and soufflé were some of the best I had; I definitely recommend the soufflé at the very least, even if it's a 15 minute wait.

Service is excellent, all servers are bilingual. Of course, as common courtesy, do attempt to at least speak a bit of French.

Will definitely recommend to my friends!
