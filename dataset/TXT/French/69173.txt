w2tr0PA0b3tg8pId0kjM-A Gaby et Jules is a great French boulangerie and patisserie. Note that I didn't say "French-style" or "French-theme." No, this is the real deal or rather très authentique! My wife and I lived for a couple of years in France and frequented local neighborhood/village stores for bread and tasty pastry treats. This place is exactly what you'd expect to find tucked away on a chic little side street in Paris or on the fancy main street of the nicer villages and towns of France.

Gaby et Jules has perfectly replicated the in-store experience and, most importantly, the taste and quality of the products. We tried a baguette (which was about half-eaten by the time we had walked the 10-minute walk home!), croissant, and a pastry called Paris-Brest (a circular choux pastry, sort of in the shape of a donut, with hazelnut cream sandwiched in between). Everything was delicious and authentic.

The service was good. Efficiency is what you want in a busy store like this, and the staff moved things along quickly, even though other customers seemed to have many questions that needed to be answered.

Perhaps the coolest part of the experience is looking through the large glass panels to the kitchen where the head pastry chef (a French guy who has worked at some of the best patisserie in Paris) and his team are hard at work. 

This is a great addition to Squirrel Hill. The best part is that it isn't an American bakery pretending to be French with substandard products. This is the real deal. Think what you will of the French and their often peculiar ways, but they do know how to make a great baguette (and macaron, croissant, etc, etc). Having something like this in Pittsburgh is great to see. Merci beaucoup Lori et Frédéric
