qr3iie2aA1ddJasU-6N1gQ Had an amazing experience at Mimi and Coco! From the Octopus and Potato appetizer to the incredible Barramundi and side dishes everything exceeded our expectations. Probably the best restaurant in Lake Las Vegas! Service and lake view are unbelievable.  Congratulations to Allessandro, the owner, who hit it out of the park at this fabulous Lake Las Vegas new restaurant. Can't wait to go back!!!
