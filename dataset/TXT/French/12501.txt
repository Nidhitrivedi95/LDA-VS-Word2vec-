4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Strangely enough, I have been here twice (once each) of my last two trips to Las Vegas.  The first time I went with three members of Team Vegas and we all got steaks.  The steaks were perfectly cooked and very flavorful.  The sauces were equally satisfying and priced very well for being on the Strip.

Brunch was very good, as well.  Had tasty mussels and took a trip or two to the Bloody Mary bar.  

There is a large patio and an atrium that is full of light on a sunny day.  

For a mid-priced meal that has exceptional quality, Mon Ami Gabi is a great choice.
