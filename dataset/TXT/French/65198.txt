TXuhhudKvAb3JIYD_wELhg I was highly impressed with La Garrigue. The onion soup was the best I've been served in a French restaurant in Edinburgh. We had an issue with their coffee, so shared our review with the restaurant. Next day they commented on the blog to say that they'd spent time re-training their temporary staff, who were working when we were there, to ensure that better quality coffee was served in the future. I don't think you can ask for more responsive service than that, so well done to all concerned.

Overall, we said: "On a rainy Edinburgh day, La Garrigue offered heartening dishes, and sent me nutritionally and spiritually restored to face the slings and arrows of outrageous afternoon fortune. I'd heartily recommend that you pay it a visit, to sample its good quality, well-presented dishes."
