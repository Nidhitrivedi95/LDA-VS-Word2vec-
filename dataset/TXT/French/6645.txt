4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Took my girlfriend on a date here thinking I was gonna be somewhat impressed. I was dead wrong! Food is alright, but mediocre for the price. Probably the worst service I've had in a while. Seated right behind Screaming drunk people. Thrown in the corner, wasnt asked for a refill or how we were doing one single time. Also made reservations but we still had to wait 20 minutes to get a table ready. I'd much rather spend my money on a Brazilian Steakhouse or something. If you're a local I suggest you avoid this place.. crappy service, mediocre food, loud obnoxious atmosphere (I was thinking this place might have been a little more romantic maybe my fault for assuming that). I could maybe see myself enjoying brunch here in the day but then again not really...
