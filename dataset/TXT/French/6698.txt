4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw So disappointed.  There were five hostesses standing around as we showed up ten minutes early for our lunch reservation,. We were seated about 12 minutes after our requested time.  Once seated we waited forever for a server.  The entire experience was just SLOW.  My meal was just average, the salad was overdressed and we had to ask for water and more drinks.

I was glad I did not suggest this restaurant since everyone in our group was let down
