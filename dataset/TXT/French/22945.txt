bzbNGyrTwWHAgg1CqkSgeg It is very disappointing to give this place one star because, the food is very very good! However, the last THREE times we have dined here have been disastrous each time. The hostess is unfriendly and cannot quote a wait time properly, the waiters have no sense of urgency and all seem unhappy and other employees seem miserable too. I ordered a fruit platter which was missing coffee cake and half the fruit, our French press only filled half of each coffee cup and we were charged full price for both of these items... we didn't want to ask for anything extra because it was so busy!! Previously we had dined here and service was exceptional along with food quality but they have taken an unfortunate turn for the worse. Despite the great food and dining here more than ten times we will not be returning.
