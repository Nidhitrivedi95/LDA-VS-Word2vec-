3kaTKUBEoZf-J_AbKdt8NA My husband and I are regulars but last month's visit was by far the best......soup, veal carpaccio, guinea foul for me and fish for him and we were in heaven. I believe these items are not on the regular menu and were specials for the week but if you have a chance to try, please do so. Service is always pretty slow so not recommended if you are in a time crunch but the food makes up for it.
