LQ_gYNs5E10IGFE0NOyD7A I haven't had a fabulous meal out in several weeks, but decided tonight I needed to break my dry spell. Arriving at Upton we were quickly greeted by the hostess. While we hadn't made a reservation (a must on Saturday night) we were offered a place at the bar. After being seated we were quickly waited on and provided with a menu. The specialty drinks looked amazing, and made it even more difficult to pass up as I watched  the bartenders prepare the drinks. As I'm not drinking for now, I quickly moved to the food menu. I was immediately drawn to the duck confit wings with Sriracha ranch dressing. The meat on the duck wings fell of the bone and was rich and succulent. For my entree I had the steak while my friend had the salmon. The steak was cooked beautifully and was juicy and flavorful. The Salmon was fresh and a perfect pink color. We shared an order of the fries which may have been my favorite part (I'm a sucker for fries). The service was outstanding, we were checked on several times by various staff other than our bartender/server and our glasses were never empty. The prices were reasonable and for the two of us our bill was under $50 (without alcohol). Looking forward  to another great meal!
