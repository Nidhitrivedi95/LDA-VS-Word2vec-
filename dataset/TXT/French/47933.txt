O3OH5IEFMPtz7mPKakPZ3Q This place was outstanding!  We went for dinner last night with a party of 5 and were able to get seated right away.  The waitress was fantastic, it was like she was spring-loaded to our table, and was very helpful.  My son and his wife ordered the special 7 course meal for 2, and the other 3 of us ordered ala carte.  We got the miso soup (excellent), rock shrimp (nice), black cod and sashimi butter lettuce wraps (excellent), salmon and tuna lotus chips (great), tuna and salmon tacos (good), beef kushiyaki (ok), land and sea tobanyaki (outstanding) and Japaneiro special yakiudon (good).  The main course on the 7 course meal was the bone marrow filet mignon with foie gras (possibly the best fusion dish ever).  This was by far the best Asian fusion meal I have ever consumed.
