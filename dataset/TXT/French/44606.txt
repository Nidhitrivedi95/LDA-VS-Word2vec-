mnn--vaYHtNyBNYFYBFIog I went to Toqué with my parents during a recent trip to Montreal. The service was excellent from the moment we walked in. Our server was incredibly attentive but not burdensome. The food was wonderful and of course had gorgeous presentation. My only criticism is that some of the prices were a bit unjustified even considering the rank and of quality of the restaurant. For example my pasta with mushrooms and meat jus was $44. It was out of this world (and ultimately worth it), but on principle alone the prices were a bit crazy. Overall a delightful, unforgettable experience.
