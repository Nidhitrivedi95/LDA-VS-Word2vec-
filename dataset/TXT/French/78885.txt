ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug We were in line for the Paris Buffet for about 10 minutes, but guess what?  We weren't.  We got seated for this joint.

I had a cobb salad.  Standard stuff.  The Bachelore had chicken fingers.  Eh.  My other bud had breakfast food.  He got served pancakes instead of the french toast he ordered.  Bonus.

The waiter was a nice guy in a ho hum place.  

Bottom line:  Walk all the way to the back of the hallway for the buffet line.
