HiMb8cwGsnFVwYxt1h0RCg I don't get why I didn't submit a review for this gem up until now. Go-to place for brunch for the past 2-3 years, I've introduced friends to the place many times and it still amazes me at how underrated the place is. Low-key attitude, pretty good service and consistent good food. Plates are huge by the way, good thing Park LaFontaine is right across the street for you to crash while you process all the deliciousness from Tôt-ou-Tard!
