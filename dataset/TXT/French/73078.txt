XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q All the good things everyone else said about the food, ambience (especially the vertical garden) service, etc.  

The only thing I didn't like what how stuffy it is.  Felt too much like a museum/library and I like being able to laugh during dinner (especially one that lasts for 3 hours).

But this was definitely a meal/experience to remember for a long time.
