Zl6csaZ5HBka3SKBphHXrQ We went for dinner after an AGO Exhibit on a Saturday.

Food: not fresh, frozen vegetables, slimy fish

Service: Unprofessional: waitress made intrusive comments to my husband and I. We were both taken aback by her unprofessional behavior and felt very uncomfortable afterwards.

Ambience: Besides the underpar food, and rude waitress  (inappropriate conduct), the deco and design of the place was cozy and quaint. 

Will not go back if it was complimentary or recommend this place to anyone. Too many good restaurants in TO that serve decent food and have pleasant servers to waste your time and money at MIDI BISTRO.

I give it a 1 star for ambiance. The food and service get a ZERO rating.
