XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q This is one of the 2 best meals of my life (I'd give it 10 stars if I could). 

Been here twice for an 8 course tasting menu in the tasting room. The tasting room decor is dark, intimate and fantastic, but you're only getting in there if you go with a big group, which I highly recommend. I also recommend getting there a little early before your meal so you can enjoy a drink in the lounge--it's like being in a friend's very fancy, yet very comfortable, parlor.

The food cannot be described as anything other than pure perfection. The taste, the presentation, the service, it is all exquisite. Trying to select the best dish of the meal is like trying to pick your favorite child. But if I had to choose, the 1st course caviar with crab meat and fennel cream would be the first-born, medical school-bound, 3 sport athlete son of the group.

The Michelin guide got it right, this place is absolutely deserving of that exclusive 3rd star.

PS: apparently yelp etiquette dictates that I add my lifetime Michelin star count?  In that case, Joel Robuchon = Michelin stars: 13-15 & 27-29 for me.  (I'm not being sarcastic, this is actually a great thing to keep track of...I'm going to put them all in a chart on my tombstone.)
