ggIWkJtgXHKnhdxRu338AQ We came just for dessert, seeking out their creme brulee, but learned that they had sold out earlier that night. He lemon tart was good,though the crust left something to be desired. Oddly, the music did not match the fine dining decor. Instead it was Simon and Garfunkel and some other oldies. The menu did look good, and we would certainly return for a full course meal. Wait staff was very friendly too.
