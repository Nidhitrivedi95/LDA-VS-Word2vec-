SCklYa_jhihWAcfIn-_chg My entire experience at this little resto was less than pleasant. The food was not great, the service added nothing positive to the experience, and the management was rude. Coffee was not refilled - which should be somewhat of an expectation when ordering drip coffee at a breakfast/ brunch joint. I wouldn't come back - do yourself a favour a don't bother either. Also I'm still hungry :(
