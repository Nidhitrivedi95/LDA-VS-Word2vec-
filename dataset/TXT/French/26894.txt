Dcj69NZJnbJhK-YHP_nULA My friend Paul took me here and raved about the quality of the restaurant. Call me skeptical but open-minded. He was right, though!!! The cheese plate was amazing, especially the sharp aged cheddar (10 yrs I believe)?!  I also had some appetizer I forgot (but it was great) and a BURGER, which was delicious and one of the best I've had in Madison. It's pretty busy, but we had no problems with seating at the bar, and they opened a second "wing" of the restaurant recently.
