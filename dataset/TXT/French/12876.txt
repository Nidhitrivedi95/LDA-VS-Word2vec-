4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw This is the perfect location for people watching and front row for the Bellagio water show. The food is expensive but it is the best seat on the blvd. The three of us ordered the seafood crepes, the eggs benedict and the quiche and salad. Everything was yummy and the servers were professional and attentive. Very francais~~~~
