rSiSZlTzHi4Ox_rFHe9CdA Oh Taqueria... I tried, I really did. I've bought nearly every dish you guys sell, but, alas, it was not meant to be.

The location is gold. That is why I kept coming back and giving you all those chances. I'm sorry to be comparing you to big guys like Chipotle, but honestly... this is supposed to be mexican food... The first time I had one of your burritos I thought it was a fluke. I thought it couldn't possibly always be THIS BLAND. I've given you guys many many chances afterwards to prove me wrong and become one of my regular lunch spots. 

Every other dish after my first burrito was bland as well. The portions were good for me (I'm a small gal that doesn't eat that much), but I'm just missing that kick of flavour that you expect out of burritos and nachos..

Overall, very disappointed and will not be back. I hope you guys will take a better look at your recipes and throw some flavour into your food sometime soon. Until then, ta ta.
