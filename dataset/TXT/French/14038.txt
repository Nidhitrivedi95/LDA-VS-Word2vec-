58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw My boyfriend and I came here for brunch on a Sunday afternoon. We waited on line for a total of maybe 10-15 minutes and was luckily seated at a two-person table. You WILL get seated next to strangers at a larger table (especially during busy hours), so for those who find settings like that uncomfortable, I would recommend you tell the hostess first thing. I can't exactly remember the brunch combo I ordered but it consisted of a bagel with CC and smoked salmon, some scrambled eggs, a sweet potato pie cake, along with fruit on the side. The combo plates are very big and are served in appropriate portions so you leave feeling satisfied in all aspects. My boyfriend ordered the crepes and really enjoyed the little pastry served with applesauce and blueberries. Brunch also comes with unlimited coffee and fresh orange juice. Overall, a great brunch experience and highly recommended.
