ufwkkMd9yr9cFU1R5ONArg I love this place. The staff are always friendly and the food is spectacular if you're looking for a good Mexican breakfast/brunch. I've gone here a few times with my girlfriend and have never been disappointed. Get the chorizo with anything you get, it's amazing, and they do a good smoothie here too (Mango is the winner). Definitely a great spot if you're feeling a hangover too, but be warned it can get quite busy on a Sat/Sun morning so be prepared to have to either wait a bit or be turned away! Worth a 10 minute wait though!
