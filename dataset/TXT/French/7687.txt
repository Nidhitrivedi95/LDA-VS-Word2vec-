4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw After reading others reviews about the steak frites and location we decided to give it a try. It has a great location where you can watch bellagios fountain show If seated on patio. We were seated quickly and orders taken quickly. The baguette and butter is really good although we would've loved french cultured butter for the bread but it was still good. We had the country pate for appetizer which was a healthy portion size with onions and cornichones and toast yummy. For mains we ordered steak frites which was well cooked,a nice portion and tasty, hubby had moules which he said was very tasty with lots of sauce, og portion as well. Overall a nice experience we would return as the servers were attentive and food flavorful and plentiful for price.
