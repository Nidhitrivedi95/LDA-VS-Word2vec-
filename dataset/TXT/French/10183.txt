4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw This was my first experience at Mon Ami and it was okay I must say. Yes, just okay.. The food was edible. Nothing to tell your friends about. Hostesses did not acknowledge my party of two. We decided to stop at the bar before being seated and she was a charm. Great conversation as well as delicious drinks. I recommend ordering the grape specialty cocktail! So we're seated and we get greeted by a wonderful Albanian server. She makes the experience better, we order, watch the beautiful view of the Bellagio Fountain Show, and end our visit. Overall as I said it was okay. I wouldn't come here again nor recommend this restaurant to anyone.
