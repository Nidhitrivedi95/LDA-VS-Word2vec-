50-xiTYmE6NERi-yJ6NvHw This is a lovely restaurant, good food, great service and wonderful ambiance.  it is a little bit pricey but the quality of the food and overall experience certainly makes up for it!  My colleagues and I enjoy coming after work for drinks and $1.00 oysters.  We tried the charcuterie & fromage - it's $38.00 - manageable for sharing!  I definitely recommend splurging and trying this restaurant for an elevated dining experience and expanding your palette to new flavours.
