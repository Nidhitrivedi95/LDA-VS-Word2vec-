YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g I can appreciate how difficult it must be to create a menu but this place needs to work a little harder. Went here with 9 others and only 2 of the entrees and one side was average or above. The other 7 entrees and multiple sides didn't get finished. Too many other, better places in Vegas. Don't waste your time on this, hoping you pick one of the acceptable meals. They get one star for effort, and that's being generous.
