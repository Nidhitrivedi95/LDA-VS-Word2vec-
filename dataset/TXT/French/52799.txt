qCSyiWDbjks5OeWHlLqd7w This place is amazing! After dining at so many restaurants in Montreal, I think I finally found this one, well priced and great taste! It's a BYOW place, take advantage of it!
We were here on Valentine's Day. We love the atmosphere, cozy and not pretentious. The pre-fixed menu is $66 with 6 courses. 
I love that the bread served here were warm, my favourite type and the butter was airy and fluffy. 
We got started with beets cappuccino with caviar. The chef was brilliant with this idea of combination, it was amazing. 
Then, horse tartar. It was exotic and not a dish you can get anywhere else. Again, great play on combination of flavour. It was great. 
I love the squid ink pasta the most! The texture was a little chewy, exactly the way I liked. The mussels were so fresh. 
Bison steak main course was tender, juicy and the sauces (red wine and butternut squash) were awesome. 
Dessert was not bad, chocolate mousse. 

The service here is not the best, they only have 2 server in the entire restaurant but they still took the time to answer questions and make sure we are enjoying our meal. 

Their food was absolutely stunning, they make really unique and creative dishes. The chef is a genius that creates amazing taste palettes! This is a hidden gem in Montreal and deserve more fame!
