AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw Overpriced yes, but it is a fine breakfast and brunch place in Caesar's palace. When you are hungover and want food this is your place. Order their coffee or smoothie (10$ btw) and a crepe and enjoy it. You pay 10$ for a smoothie but you get fruits and sorbet and yogurt in a glass :) the Nutella and banana crepe was yummy and so was the berry crepe. They have reasonably priced coffee however. The service is okay; they are always very busy!! If you want to sit down and have food make sure to have a reservation. Or pack your stuff and sit at the food court a couple feet away.
