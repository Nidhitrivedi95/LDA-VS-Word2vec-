xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g Romantic?  A resounding YES!  Tables for two around the perimeter, all with beautiful views. The service was impeccable, our waiter very knowledgeable and friendly, but not so friendly as to be annoying.  The dinner itself was delicious, dessert was amazing and the ambiance was exactly what we had hoped for.  Worth every penny.
I've said it before, yet I feel it bears repeating - leave your children at home, this is a place for adults.  Nothing spoils a beautiful romantic dinner like children too small to behave or appreciate fine dining.
Guys, you should suit up for this restaurant.  
A lovely place to dress up for, enjoy the food, gaze at the fountains across the way, hold hands across the table and sip a martini.  Everything I expected and more!
