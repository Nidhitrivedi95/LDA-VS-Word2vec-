DJcvnN7BCiqOUAra35xYuA Rice Paper is a great stop for lunch (or Happy Hour) in your central downtown Phx area. They used to be Bonjour Vietnam, but have changed for some reason. 

The venue itself isn't too huge, but is decorated in contemporary design and has add'l tables/seating on patio area.

Service has always been very friendly and helpful. I haven't tried too many items on menu but do recommend the Ahi Tuna (raw) salad. Yum! I had the Filet Mignon Pho for lunch and it was delicious, however, I wish the meat was on the more medium to rare side. NOTE: Cilantro sprigs aren't served by default; if you need this to add to your soup, just ask! :)

Spring Rolls (I was eye-balling with envy) looked tasty too. Next time.
