This inside is dark and very bar like, yet hip & comfortable enough. The outside patio is nice, lush and well done, but both areas are very small. We had to play musical plates, glasses (well everything that was on the table) as we were being served our main course. There is just not enough room on the tables and they have gigantic plates - not much thought put into that one.

But in general it was nice, the food was good (not great) and the prices were not too crazy - although paying $10 for a "large" avian water is totally ridiculous!

If you go, sit on the patio. It is a pleasant experience. They have mirrors, plants, misters/heaters and candles everywhere - really nicely done and has a romantic ambiance.
