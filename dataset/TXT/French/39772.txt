K2C8dSx9215LLcIzHL959Q This place was phenomenal! My fiancé went here for Restaurant Week, which offered a 3-course meal. Presentation of the food was awesome. What I thought was really cool was they put liquid nitrogen on certain drinks and foods, which created a fun effect. They used it on The Frenchman drink and chocolate mousse to freeze their "frozen chocolate." Everything we ordered was delicious and unique...smoked salmon, white bean soup with soft shell crab, the duck, and gnocchi. The staff was friendly and gave a short explanation of what was on the dish that they put in front of you. The chef even came out to present the desserts to us. I would strongly recommend this restaurant for fine dining. The restaurant is small, so I would strongly suggest making a reservation.
