rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w Five stars for the Foie Gras dish here. Perfectly executed and generous portion, unless you're doing tasting menu, it's half the normal size. The other signature dishes, the lobster salad, the rabbit stew, and chilean seabass were not outstanding. In fact, the duck and lamb dishes outshined the signature dishes. I would do the $98 Pre-fixe dinner over the tasting menu. The main dining room is stunning, with the view of water show. Be sure to request during reservations or risk being seated outside the main dining room near the entrance. Service was good but they do not fawn over you like in finer restaurants. Overall a good value and solid French food in Las Vegas.
