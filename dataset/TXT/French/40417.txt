KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA Marche Bacchus has a very special place in my heart... the site of the 1st "romantic" date with my husband.  We had a lovely dinner with soft live jazz playing nearby, then a walk around the lake.  The moments dreams are made of.

These days, there is not much I enjoy more than sitting outside on Marche's patio, enjoying a glass of wine and splitting a cheese platter or a bowl of delicious mussels with my friends and family.  Pure Bliss!
