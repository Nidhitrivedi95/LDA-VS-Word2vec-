lkY7son6wZKZ-eoR2HVxKg I was here when the exchange rate was a bit more favorable, so my excellent experience was had at a steal.  The atmosphere was polished, and, strangely, quaint, the service was very attentive, and the price was quite reasonable.

My flank steak, cooked on a bed of fresh spinach leaves, heaped over potatoes, was cooked exactly as I asked (med-rare), and the portions were generous.  The chocolate mousse was rich and delicate, and the whipped cream was, of course, homemade.

What really stood out here was the coffee service.  Never in my life have I had a better, or more memorable, coffee experience, while dining.  For under $3, I was brought an apparatus- the only way I can describe it.  

OK, to be more specific, coffee was served in a brass coffee brewer that operated from a candle, and, over the course of 10 minutes, brewed, filtered and poured (by front spigot) 3.5 mugs of fresh coffee, right at the table.  The coffee was accompanied by an entire tray of accessories, including three types of sugar, homemade whipped cream, two typed of shaved chocolate, etc.  As someone who usually drinks my coffee black (if the quality warrants it), I couldn't help but try some of everything.  It was exquisite.  The complementary chocolate truffles were a nice finishing touch (though, there were so many of them, I might have skipped dessert, had I known).

This restaurant will always be on my to do list for any trip to Montreal.
