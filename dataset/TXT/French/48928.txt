OkC86YtZ0Nm19my5F4GGrQ Tartine is one of those cozy, elegant places that reminds you of a hidden Parisian bistro.  The owner, a happy man with a comforting presence, walks from table to table to make sure everyone is doing fine.  My first trip here was for Valentine's Day, very cliche but I'm not one to care.  We had the delicious mussels in a smooth white bean and wine sauce.  The plump mussels were the star of the bowl, unlike most places that drown out the taste with garlic and butter.
The salads are the perfect appetizer side and always come with crisp, fresh ingredients.  The steak is fork tender with a peppercorns and roasted potatoes. 
Interesting enough, I've never had a tartine here.  The specials always look so good.  That's my next trip though
The desserts tend to change but are always good.
The prices are good, the food is amazing.  You can't help but feel you just took place in something special.
