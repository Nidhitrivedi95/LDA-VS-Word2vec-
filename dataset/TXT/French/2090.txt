0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g The best restaurant I've ever been to in my life. Both times I've came here, I still havnt changed my mind. ESP their 150+ extra filet mignon.. pure amazing. I thought nothing can beat Mastros steak, but I was wrong. The filet here kills all steak in the world! Everything else is absolutely amazing as well. Even the raisin and bacon bread is bomb!
