hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA I can see why this place gets great reviews. From the moment I arrived I was treated as a friend by the staff. When the server found out it was my first trip to the Cafe they gave me a quick run down on the menu and the daily specials. They were very helpful. I had the turkey baguette, side salad, iced tea. They all were very fresh and tasted great. The prices  were very reasonable. The service was quick. This is definitely going to be a regular stop for lunch. I can't wait to try some of the other items on the menu.
