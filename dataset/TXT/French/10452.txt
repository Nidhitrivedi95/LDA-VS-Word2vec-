4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Heard good things about the blueberry french toast and crepes! Was so excited to come here! Location was awesome! Right on the strip and across the street from the Bellagio! Saw the show from our table. Blueberry French toast was good, but nothing to write home about. Service was good. Would come back for the location but try something different! FYI: guys, wear a shirt!!!! Me and my boyfriend wore tank tops.... They gave him a free white t-shirt to wear, but allowed me to wear mine!!! So lame!
