4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I'm addicted to their brunch - especially their daily Eggs Benedict special.  A favorite was the lobster benedict.  I've always been waited on my a kind and courteous staff.  And when the hostess says "inside or outside" she really means "outside", not a fake vegas "outside" with clouds painted on the ceiling.  Outside is strip side view right across from the Belagio fountains.
