uBXEI3Vq8ZSQkhkgN5z6aQ The food here is spectacular. Waiters are also attentive. Be warned that this place is a byob, which is nice, but plan ahead. The reason that I rate this place a 2 rather than a 5 is because at the beginning of your meal they will sell you a soup and dessert for $5; however, when the bill comes they add the price of the dessert to the bill and claim that the included dessert is a lesser dessert. It would not be a big deal except that they do this in a very deceptive manner (i.e., they do not tell you that you should have gotten a specific dessert until the bill arrives).
