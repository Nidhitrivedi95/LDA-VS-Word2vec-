One thing to bear in mind for the American tourist is that Montreal is very smoke friendly and although they can't smoke inside any more, you will see smoking on patios and decks. I saw an American girl at an adjacent table bristle when the occupant of the next table lit up a ciggy.

The baked brie appetizer was good, but the service was slooooooow. Also, the tables were so close to each other that I was literally sitting at the next table. 

I love the line that the greeter gave us when we sat, "You can sit here, but if it rains you are SOL" - it sounds so much better in French though.
