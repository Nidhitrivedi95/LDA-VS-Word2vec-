K64Uw3a2Enh2MznpwRHWKQ We were celebrating our December birthdays and wanted to try something new.  We had a Groupon so we decided to give Razz's a try.  Bottom line - Excellent dining experience.  Bread and water was on the table as we sat down.  The waiter was fantastic - attentive, but not overbearing.  I had the Sea Bass special and it was one of the best I have had.  My wife had the pork tenderloin which she raved about throughout the meal.  The only downside was the noise level, but that was more the result of a large table of diners next to us.  We were able to tune them out eventually.  We will definitely visit them again.
