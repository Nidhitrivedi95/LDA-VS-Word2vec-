HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw Having tried two other french bistros in town - Mon Ami Gabi and Bouchon - I'll contrast against them.  The setting in Cosmopolitan is great, amazing view of the Strip through large picture windows so everyone feels like they have a good table, it beat the crammed Mon Ami and is just different from the quiet courtyard setting of Bouchon.

The food is good, but not extraordinary, the Steak Tartare at Del Frisco is much better, the foie gras was okay, quite a small portion, and the bone marrow and oxtail were as good or better than at Blue Ribbon Sushi.

The steaks were all good, completely unsalted, french fry portions were large enough for three though and not that good.  You would hope they could make some good pommes frites, the quantity did not compensate for the lack of quality!

All-in-all, would not go back, just too many better choices.
