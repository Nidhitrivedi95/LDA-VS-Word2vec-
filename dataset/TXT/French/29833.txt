FJMMPL3pxAPYGEPB0Hwlhw TOCA is a welcome addition to the entertainment district. I haven't been for brunch (yet!) but I've heard good things. Dinner was very well done. I don't have much to say that hasn't been said before but it justifies it's price and has a great atmosphere. The food is consistently delicious and waiters are always helpful. Phenomenal wine list as well! The food is pleasing to everyone, making it a great spot for a group celebration. Ingredients always taste fresh and prepared artfully. The Ritz as a whole is a winner for its restaurants, and TOCA is no exception. Absolutely recommend!
