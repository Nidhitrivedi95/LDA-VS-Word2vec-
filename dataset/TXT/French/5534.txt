3jKUbhGSjFTv5jZ0wnW0xA I was nervous when we got there because the French place next to it was packed and this place was pretty empty.  Yet,  I found out later that the other place was BYOB. We were blown away by how perfectly cooked our meat was. We had a filet mignon and another cut I can't remember. The potatoes we had on the side were a gratin that was incredible. 

On top of it all, the restaurant is located on a quaint street good for people watching. Especially if you want to try something different than Old Town. We felt that compared to many of the places we looked at that this was very reasonably priced Appetizer, steak with sides, and a bottle of wine for about $80.
