sARavfidmIS878q5BtlyVQ I want to thank Stephanie and the other "Hosts" for making our experience at "E" a truly remarkable and once-in-a-lifetime experience. Mia and her team of chefs were incredible as well. The teamwork everyone exhibited to ensure we had a 5-star experience was incredible. We were a group of 8 (we had the entire "restaurant" to ourselves). It was a birthday celebration and there is no other place I can imagine that would have been more perfect than this.  

Ok, so.... the food.......    The food was fun, whimsical, creative, entertaining.   To me, this is more about the whole experience than it is about the food (I don't want to be negative, but don't go for the food.. go for the service, the experience, and the interaction with the chefs).  The food is good, but it does not warrant 5 stars.

Overall, I would absolutely go back. The experience was stellar!
