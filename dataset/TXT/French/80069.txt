zv92BYJH09YjFQOtSyYp-A We had a really lovely meal here on our first night in Montreal. The cheese plate was delicious and HUGE, the wine we ordered was very good, and we ended up going with the special they were running that night for our entree. I had vegetable soup and trout, while my boyfriend had salad and steak. Everything was really good, and the service was perfect. 

There seem to be a lot of poor reviews for this place, but my experience was lovely, and I would absolutely return. Also - get the creme brulee! It's delicious!
