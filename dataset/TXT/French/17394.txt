I came on a Sunday afternoon.  My first course was a glass of house red and Quiche Lorraine.  The wine from Chile was a good choice and opened up with time and a bit of warmth.  The quiche was a bit perplexing.  The crust was like some kind of industrial pot pie crust.  The filling -- while very good -- did not have authentic ingredients or presentation.   A tad disappointing from a place that bills itself as a bit of Paris in Montreal.

Desert was much better.  Cheesecake -- not your traditional French fare - was stand up and take notice good.  So good you slowed your bites to make it last and to enjoy the perfectly balanced flavors and sublime texture.

All in all, the place is worth a visit and I will be back to try the famous croissants.
