xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g This place was amazing. We came here to hang out after the Backstreet Boys awesome concert. 

Staff is super nice, and we got our own table. Service is great. Great music lots of dancing and it happened to be a warm night out on the strip so stunning views. 
Will come back here to hang out and just get my groove on in the future.

Call in advance about the dress code. We got in with jeans one night but not the next.
