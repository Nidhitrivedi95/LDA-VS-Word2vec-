iEsNloJgy-MyA-_wqeB6jg Since moving to AZ, I have actively been trying to hunt down a really good traditional French restaurant somewhere in the valley.  I was hoping this place would be the answer, but I found myself disappointed again.  We started with the escargot appetizer, which was decent.  Not outstanding, but probably slightly better than average.  For my entree, I ordered the Seafood Newburg.  While it was not outright disgusting, it wasn't even close to being on par with some other French restaurants I have dined at.  Dessert wasn't bad, but certainly not noteworthy.  I had a chocolate covered pistachio cake.  In regards to the atmosphere, I found it to be a bit run down and shabby.  Not at all like the romantic classic bistro feel like many other French restaurants I have been to.  In my opinion, it was just okay.  My overwhelming feeling as I left was that it was fine and edible, but I have had much better elsewhere.
