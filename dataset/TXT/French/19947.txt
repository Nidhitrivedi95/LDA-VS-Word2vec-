aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw Holy Baked Goods, Batman!!!  This place, OMG, I mean, wowzers.  There really aren't words available to properly describe the tasty goodness that is Bouchon.  On my recent trip to Vegas, I had pastries, macarons, coffee and cookies from this place every day.  The cheese danish was killer!  It is a good thing we don't have one of these in Phoenix because I would probably weigh 300lbs if I had easy access to this place.  The macarons are a must, just do it, and if your me, get your macarons with a side of cheese danish - yes, I'm that girl.  :)  Enjoy!
