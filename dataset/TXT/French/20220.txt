aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw My boyfriend and I came here every morning during our 4 day vacation in Vegas. However, the first morning we mistakingly went into the Bouchon restaurant. When we got there i told the hoestess that I had thought that Bouchon was just a bakery not a full fledged restaurant and she replied oh no we are a full restaurant.... Yeah not sure why she didnt tell me that the bakery was just downstairs.... 

Anyways i had tried the chocolate almond croissant and the pecan cinnamon roll when we had breakfast at the restaurant which was really good but pretty expensive.... typical Vegas... The pecan roll was just okay but the chocolate almond croissant, i fell in love with. I proceeded to get one every day we were there after that.... yeah its that good. I really wanted to try a macaron, but i like the very clever, atypical flavors. They only offer the very standard vanilla and chocolate kind of flavors, so i opted to pass.
