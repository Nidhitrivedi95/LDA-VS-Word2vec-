AHosGBveeXx9YjsQvdJgeg My wife and I went tonight as we're moving away from Charlotte and wanted to have a nice dinner beforehand. We ordered the Queen Charlotte Salad, very tasty and fresh though the dressing was a bit too overpowering for my taste buds. We continued with the Chateaubriand for two. I was a bit skeptical as the tenderloin is not usually as flavorful as other cuts of beef. But this was amazing, cooked as ordered with an amazing sauce. The side items included asparagus, sautéed mushrooms, potato dauphinoise. I'll note that the asparagus were cooked to perfection which is not always the case. Anyways, back to the beef. It was as tender as anything and just spectacular, despite not being labeled as prime on the menu. We did had dessert, the creme brulee, which was good. The service was outstanding, our drinks were never left to empty which is a great indication that they're on top of their game. Moreover, the head waiter turnover is minimal, if non existent, assuring consistency in the experience. Coupled with the view and intimate atmosphere, this is hands down among the top restaurant experiences in Charlotte.

The two negatives I see is that the table top cooking is really more for show, as the Chateaubriand and the rest of the meal were already cooked, the table side cooking was just to make the sauce and slightly brown the beef. If advertising as table side then they should stick to it. The other negative is that this is not really a French restaurant, more like an American restaurant with some slight French inspiration. But all said I will note that what they do they do really well. Definitely worth the time and money.
