oJZNHz5UUVUgrZwVBVlpYw I think I will just stick with the Baccarat Bar in the Bellagio instead of Petrossian. At least there wasn't mold in my raspberries and the server was better. Not sure why the cocktail at the Petrossian was priced a bit higher than the one at Baccarat. 
I'll just have my Bella Peach cocktails minus the mold at Baccarat, which also has a live pianist.
