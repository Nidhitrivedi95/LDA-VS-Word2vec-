wuuJhxMDAj5gGVdvobGHJg Three of us ended up in Les Trois Petits Bouchons for our 3 days trip to Montreal.

Definitely recommend you to make a reservations as the restaurant is small, cozy and intimate.. it was even quite busy on a Monday night.

Meat lovers heaven and you definitely have a taste of food sourced locally. 

Our waiter was really helpful, cheerful and eagerly explained what they offered for the night.

We ended up sharing Bouchonnailles ($20) as our appetizer, which has assorted of cured meat and sausages (I think I need to start taking notes of the things I am eating!) perfect portion for the 3 of us...

For main we all have a taste with wine pairing suggestion from our waiter:

Pintade Tortellini ($28) 
- Guinea Fowl in creamy sauce was just a tad to heavy for me... 

Tartare de Veau ($21.50)
- Veal tartar was fresh and have a great texture... 

Confit ($18) for my non adventurous friend that always want buffalo wings
- A little too try but taste wise was rich and comforting...

For Dessert we shared

Chocolate Chaud ($7)
- Dark Spicy Chocolate Rum "Soup"... kind of like a hot chocolate ...
- perfect for a cold winter night... I can have the whole thing all for myself....  (stop rolling your eyes!!)

Thanks everyone at LTPB for their hospitality.... wonderful food,  service and companion!
