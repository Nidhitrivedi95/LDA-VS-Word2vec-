oPGUbqBpHNZvVu9gAFJbMQ came here for my bday.  we were greeted at the door and our jackets and hats were quickly taken for us. our server spoke great english and the wait team was very nice. we have a new version of the old classic French75 which was very good. we shared two starters and both had fish. both prepared with love. the halibut was like a pillow, moist and tender.  we shared two desserts and both were fantastic. what a great find would love to come back with friends or just to sit at the bar for drinks.
