4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw We had an amazing breakfast at Mon Ami Gabi....so good that there was no question we would return for breakfast again the next morning! I used the Open Table app on my phone to make reservations and it was easy to alter them if we woke up earlier or later in the morning. I do recommend reservations or going before 9am to avoid a wait. Sitting outside is great, but there are also lots of seats on the patio where you are still basically outside. The inside decor is a little dark so it would be fine for evening dining, but not ideal for breakfast. There is no wait for breakfast inside though so if I was hungry, I'd go for it!

I had the scrambled egg platter both mornings. Eggs cooked perfectly, shredded hash browns, and toasted thick bread. One morning I had bacon, which was the thickest cut bacon ever and was delicious. The other day I opted for sausage, which was great too. My husband had the Quiche Lorraine and an omelet on our second trip and was very happy with his meals too. 

Service was excellent from the hostess to the manager, servers, etc. Everyone was incredibly friendly. The coffee mugs were tiny, which concerned me, but our mugs were literally refilled every few minutes....it was amazing! I felt the prices were reasonable for Vegas and for the two of us we paid $30-$40 total. If we had been in Vegas longer, I would have loved to try their lunch or dinner.
