XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q Definitely worth every dollar and this place definitely costs a lot of dollas! 3 Michelin star does not disappoint. 

We were lucky and got a reservation here since we have been talking about dining here for a long time. We opt for the 6 course meal for $250 each, definitely on the pricey side of all the 3 star restaurants. We also were not told about the complimentary limo service provided by the restaurant & drove ourselves and had to pay valet.

The interior decor was very grandier, traditional, tasteful and bright. We were seated in a corner booth in nice coushy seats. The plate setting was perfect, so was the service, military precision. There were more service staff than customers! Silverware replaced and table cleaned after every course.

The food was amazing of course but the highlight of my meal has to be the as assortment of sweets and candy provided at the end of our meal. I got really greedy and asked for one of each and was having a total blast riding the sugar high for a while. Great meal and lovely staff.
