jo4KmAqlZ7vxjHIP7IIkAw Came here with a large group of friends (12 of us) for the Summerlicious dinner menu for the first time. I had a curry lentil soup to start, seafood pasta for the main, and crème brûlée for dessert. I couldn't order any of the starters with the soft cheeses so I settled for the soup. It was surprisingly good! The pasta was great and the portion was pretty big. The dessert was good, but the top was slightly more burnt than I expected so it was rough to chew and got stuck in my teeth.

Overall, we all loved the food and the atmosphere. We were seated on the back patio and got to enjoy the perfect weather. The staff were super friendly and cheerful. We will definitely be coming back again!
