nk9lP-iXi7xklwN3VYf6Ew Winterlicious Lunch 2012 ($25 tax in) was not bad... but something definitely missing at Sen5es.

Services was excellent by the way. The manager even came to check my winter jacket and our waitress was really attentive and polite. Our water glasses were never empty...

But the food?! The food I found it a little bland and not interesting.... I do know it is a Licious experience...I have high hopes for their desserts but even that was not one of the best I had during Licious. 

I tried:

Seafood Croquettes / Cucumber & Seaweed Salad / Roasted Red Pepper Tartar Sauce
- The sauce has saved this dish. The croquettes tastes kind of bland but the sauce has good flavours and with just a little kick of spice in it

Citrus Cured Salmon / Warm Lentil Salad / Baby Shanghai Bok Choy / Braised Endive / Herbed Oil
- Cooked well, with the outer layer crispy and the inside moist
- if you like fish then you would enjoy that

Orzo Pasta / Mushroom / Baby Spinach / Fine Green Beans / Pearl Onions / Baby Carrots / Spiced Red Pepper & Tomato Sauce (vegetarian)
- only order it if you are vegetarian.... my friend definitely did not enjoy that too much as we try to convince each other to have some more :)

Warm Calvados Scented Apple Crumble / French Vanilla Ice Cream 
- Though it is not the best Apple Crumble, but definitely the best part of the meal
- Maybe of the Calvados, an apple brandy?! Sweet smell of liquors..... 

The dinner menu for $45 has really similar dishes aside from the appetizers. For $25 as a get together with my Best friend at Soho is worth the price tag, but I definitely don't think it is for dinner!
