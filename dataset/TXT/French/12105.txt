4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Had the Moscou Mule and the Wild Boar Ragu. The mule was delicious as well as refreshing. The Wild Boar Ragu had beautiful pasta as well as tender pieces of boar, bacon and cheese. The pasta noodles were cooked to perfection and the boar was juicy and flavorful. Recommend highly.
