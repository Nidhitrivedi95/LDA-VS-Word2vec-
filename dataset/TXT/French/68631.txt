vLkKorA1gPS97Zj0_WKA0Q The best French restaurant I've ever been to. Love the fact that traditional French cuisine is served in such a modern setting.  My colleagues and I all had different dishes and we all end up sharing. Order anything on the menu and you should not be disappointed. Kudos to the pastry chef too because our meals finished off nicely with a his surprises. Sure they are pricey but we were well fed. No one left with an empty stomach.
