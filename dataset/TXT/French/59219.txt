rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w The quality of food, service, ambiance you get at Le Cirque is world class.  I think if I may dare say, had the best meal ever at Le Cirque but it may have been the beautiful French accents from our wait staff and the view of the Bellagio fountain right next to me that was doing the trick... From the minute we entered this restaurant, I knew we were up for an amazing experience.  The level of attention you receive from the host, bartender, sommelier, manager, and waiter all at once is overwhelming yet flattering.  I loved their accents...My friend and I honestly couldn't get enough.  We chose the Tasting menu with the premier wine pairings. Amazing combinations, one by one explained to us in detail by the lovely sommerlier.  Some of my favorites of the night was the lobster salad.. a must try! fois gras was the best I've ever had...perfectly done, and the risotto! AMAZING...the sea bass which was paired with a Red surprised me but I later found out that it was because the sea bass is cooked in Pinor Noir sauce...AH.... i wanna go back! The damage was done after having our last course, the Souffle! chocolate souffle!  Had a bite and we were done...not because it wasn't good but our stomachs were maxed out...i think a box of biscottis packed in elegant le cirque boxes were a nice touch!  The bill came out to be just under $800 for the two of us...I know crazy... we did drink alot and besides Bellagio comped for all our meals...can't wait to go back!!!!!!!!
