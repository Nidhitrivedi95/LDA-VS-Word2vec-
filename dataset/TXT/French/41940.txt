We had a large breakfast  so we only wanted to get the french staples! We ordered the escargot and a mixed meats and cheese plate.

Escargot- $9 highly recommend one of the best we ever had! So cheesy and lots of delicious garlic oil with parsley. 

Meats + cheese plate - we added foie gras so it was about $30! Wonderful we could not finished and took it to go and has it as snack later with some wine in our hotel room!

This can very well look like a tourist trap as it is in old Montréal.  However we found ourselves enjoying our time here and really taking in the French Canadian cuisine.  We were seated close to the back area. The only thing that bothered me was my eyes due to the smoke so the ventilation needs to be better.
