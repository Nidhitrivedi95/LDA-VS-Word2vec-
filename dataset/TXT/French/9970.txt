4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw The place was packed. I made a reservation was told they were running 10 mins left. Fine. 

I ordered the country pate for an appetizer. It was so dry. The baguette was burnt. 

The salmon baby kale salad was eh. The salmon was done right but the amount of dressing placed on the kale was overbearingly salty. 

The French onion soup was delicious. 

The creme brûlée was okay. The inside was good but the brûlée was burnt hitch took away my enjoyment of the dessert. 

Nevertheless, I won't be back.
