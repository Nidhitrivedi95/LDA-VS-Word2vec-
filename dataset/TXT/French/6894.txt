4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw We chose this establishment for my Birthday due to the advertisement for Steaks . I ordered the Filet Mignon Medium rare. When I received my steak it was medium well. My husband brought this to our waiters attention and he was non pulsed so he spoke to the Maitre'd who was kind enough to remove it from our bill, however, the reason for this review is the waiter. He came back with the comment after we thanked him that "It was the lighting causing me to think it was medium well" He treated us like country bumpkins that didn't know the difference. Out of all the wonderful restaurants in Vegas I picked the most condescending arrogant snooty place I could find and I guarantee we won't be back. Big goose egg's to this place
