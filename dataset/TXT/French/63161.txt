SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA You honestly can't go wrong with this restaurant! I've been here multiple times over the years and they truly never disappoint! 

Mushroom soup with sorrel purée and chives- wonderfully flavored and mild. The sorrel really adds a bright, citrus and grassy flavor that compliments the mushroom so well.

Salad with radish, beets, Camembert style goat cheese, and truffle vinegrette- the dressing was KILLER and the cheese was incredible.

Striped bass with red pepper purée, asparagus, ramps, peas, and mushrooms- the bass was nicely seared, the veggies were great (you can't beat ramps) but the sauce made the dish! It was sweet and bright and really just blended perfectly with the dish.

Cheese plate- I've never found a better cheese board selection outside of San Francisco. The server presenting the cheeses was super knowledgeable and the options were great. I LOVED this! 

Overall, I've never had a bad meal and certainly didn't today. The service is terrific, wine list epic, and ambiance is modern and cool. I'll definitely be back, if only for the cheese!!!
