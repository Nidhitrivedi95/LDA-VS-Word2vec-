FYI we booked through opentable but the restaurant did not seem to have the reservation. Although the server and staff were extremely accommodating given this fact, I recommend reserving through their website rather than a third party like opentable just in case. 

The ambiance is perfect for a group setting or a romantic evening. Out of the four restaurants we tried this week, this was the first one where 2.5 hours relatively flew by and we didn't feel like we were waiting for service or the next course. I think it's because our amazing server "checked in" on us often and refilled our waters without us noticing we needed anything. 

The short rib and salmon tartare were amazing. I believe they're both on the regular menu so we will definitely be back to order these items again.
