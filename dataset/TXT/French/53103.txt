QeFsIMcIFIJcOrpthYL8jg We were here last week.  Our last day in Montreal and we stopped in for some lunch. The food was good and the service was excellent. When we were leaving it started to downpour which forced us to take up a seat at the bar and have another glass of wine.  The bartender was very nice and helped us with directions. It's a bit off the beaten down tourist trap path which makes it extra nice.  We saved the best stop for last in Montreal.
