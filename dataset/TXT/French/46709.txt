nkHaix6KenApS8M-liZsCQ I admit it: I have a horrible bias against any restaurant located in a mall.  I assume that all mall restaurants are either a franchise of some awful chain or some restaurant corporation's lowest common denominator cuisine.  Well, I couldn't be more wrong about Christopher's located in the Biltmore Fashion Park Mall.  Everything I had was great:  lobster bisque, duck confit salad, lobster pot pie, and a vanilla soufflé for dessert.  The prices are most reasonable, and there's even a happy hour from 3-6 pm.  Best of all, everything I had was real food, that is, food made from scratch (nothing frozen, out of a jar, can, or plastic bag) from fresh ingredients.  Also, the service was friendly, attentive, and very professional.  I can't wait to go back!
