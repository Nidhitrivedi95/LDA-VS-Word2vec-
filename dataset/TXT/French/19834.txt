I love carrot cake and I love dessert you can eat with your hands. This fulfills that criteria and therefore equates with a pleasant eating experience. 

Look for the bakery under the escalators, near the guest elevators, on the casino level of the Venetian. They had soooo many other things I wanted to try, but I stated my reasoning for ordering what I did and it was satisfying indeed.
