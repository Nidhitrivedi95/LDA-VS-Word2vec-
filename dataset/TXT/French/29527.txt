f4vb5tv60WaBcwzRhKpANA My boyfriend and I stopped in earlier this morning and got an almond croissant which was great. He's not really a pastry person so I was surprised at how much he loved it. There ended up being some chocolate in the middle which he liked even more. So much that we had to go back a couple hours later and get three of them. They didn't end up having the chocolate in the middle like the first one we had though. I didn't mind but my boyfriend was a bit disappointed. We noticed the pastries of the day and decided to get one of those as well. There was an apricot pistachio and a fig one. I let my boyfriend decide and he chose apricot pistachio even though I wanted the fig one haha. The cashier, who I think might also be an owner, must have overheard me because she ended up giving me the fig pastry to try for free! I haven't tried the pistachio yet but the fig was amazing. Safe to say we'll be back not only for the pastries but the great customer service(they're extremely sweet and welcoming when you enter the store so we're not only coming back because they gave us a free pastry). We've already decided to have the French breakfast and the Italian sandwich on our next visit.
