JezHN-9KKLTMbojq00VP0g I had read all the reviews on this place and really wanted to try it - so talked a friend into going today.  I ordered a savory crepe with egg, brie and mushrooms (the crepe was buckwheat - which was a nice touch).  Problem is there was sooooo very much crepe and sooooo very little filling it that all you tasted was buckwheat.   The crepe came with a side dish of white beans and I think it was lentils as well.  But that's just what they tasted like - cooked lentils and beans - not dressed at all - not seasoned - just sorta there and unappealing.

My friend ordered the french toast on raisin bread - it came with some chevre (not much), sliced strawberries (not man) and real maple syrup.  I must say, though, that even though I would have liked to see the french toast more lavishly presented with fruit and chevre, the flavor was great, unlike my crepe.

All in all this was a disappointment for me.
