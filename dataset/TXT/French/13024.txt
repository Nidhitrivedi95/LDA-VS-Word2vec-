4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw We made a reservation for 6 and were brought to a table within 10 minutes of our reservation time.  The restaurant tables are jammed so close together you can barely walk by them and many tables are so on top of each other that its like youre eating dinner with strangers.  We had to change tables because our seats were so close to the next table we could barely move.  We were moved to a table with a bit more room which worked out fine. 

Fortunately the food made up for the atmosphere.  Starters of onion soup, goat cheese and escargot were all excellent. 

Entrees of sea scallops were excellent, Steaks were all very good, as were most sides. String beans and mashed cauliflower were very good. French fries were standard fare.  Waitress recommended mac and cheese was less than average. Not creamy but rather clumpy and dry. 

Overall the food was very good, the only big negative was the loud crowded dining room .We would return for the food.
