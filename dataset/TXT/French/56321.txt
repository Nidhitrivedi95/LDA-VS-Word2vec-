rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Whenever I go to Vegas, I make it to Bouchon. It's my favorite place to get dinner or breakfast, so I often go more than once.

The seafood platter is exceptional, the breakfast "fruit croissant" the best I've ever had...but what really makes Thomas Kellers Las Vegas location stand out is the phenomenal service. 

I've realized over the last few years that the staff doesn't seem to turn over...as I've had the same servers for dinner and breakfast year after year. They love their jobs and it shows in their work. Add this level of service to already stellar fare and you end up with a dining experience you'll remember.

Oh...and their "Bouchon blend" coffee (made by Equator coffee) is amazing, and you can buy it for your home too!
