OmFXBWLv1DoFelP2-RLqFA We came here as the one fancy dinner for my buddy's bachelor party.  Although the food was great and the service was polite, it took forrrrrreveerr to get our food.  We were in this restaurant for about a total of 2.5 hours.  About one hour of that was waiting for the food to come out and between dishes.  

I've only added pics of the dishes that I loved/remembered.  This place knows steak.  All the red meat we had was perfectly seared.  The scallops were also perfectly seared and I loved the seafood mac n cheese.  Everything else was average.  

If it wasn't for the scallops, steaks and polite service, this place would only get two stars from me.  

I wouldn't return, but I would recommend for groups of four or less.  Stick to the steaks, seafood mac n cheese, and the scallops.  Don't let them hold you up for two hours though.  Time is expensive when I'm on vacation.
