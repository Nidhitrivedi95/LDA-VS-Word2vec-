KNBHGY4rQVuoHxZf_6ANuw I've got major beef with ANY establishment that charges $16/day for WiFi. It's 2013, people! C'mon! You can do better than that. I've stayed in cheap motels that offer free wifi. Especially for an international traveler, wifi is super important, and paying $16 per day for something that *should* be FREE really grinds my gears. Now that my rant is out of the way, the hotel was decent. Nothing special. The concierge desk NEVER picked up the phone when I called from the room which was semi-annoying. But overall, not a bad place to stay in Montreal.
