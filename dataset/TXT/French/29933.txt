fKDyiIcFLkl-_5d4JsvBXA This place is just perfect ....
I really crave their steak and fries from time to time ..
This place has only one item in the menu ...
It is a meal that starts with a nice soup then a really weird salad that I eat every time and promise myself to skip it the next time ...
Then comes the great steak and fries that is to die for.
You will end the meal with a nice piece dessert.
The ambiance and the staff reminds me of the beautiful 80's .
It is a place that you must visit if you are coming to Montreal .
