mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q I went there for my birthday this year with three friends. We ordered the pre fixe. The food was just okay, not exceptional, which is unacceptable at their price point.

Sadly, the bread was one of the better offerings. We had to wait so long in between each course (15-20 minutes) and needed to repeatedly ask to get our water refills. We asked for the bill a few times and had to wait 30 minutes. We were so tempted to walk out.
