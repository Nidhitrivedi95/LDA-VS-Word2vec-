MdjIl105vqCYUGKFSUVytA Colette is a little piece of Paris hidden in the streets of Toronto. 

If you're longing for an authentic macaron or a beautifully curated selection of teas and decor, Colette is your destination. Every time I'm looking for a quick coffee break, meeting place, or a place to de-stress Colette is on the top of my list. Their desserts and cappuccinos are beautifully made and the staff are extremely friendly and welcoming.

They often even remember your order if you happen to strike a conversation or two. 

Highly recommend coming here for a couple coffees or cocktails with your friends. Don't forget your camera.
