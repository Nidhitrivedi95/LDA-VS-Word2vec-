gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA This is my new favorite restaurant!  The view is romantic, the service is great, and the food was amazing!  My salad had so much flavor I almost wanted to order another one.  I like red meat but often times find that Filet Mignon a bit too dry and tasteless, this one was delicious... and the sides that came out with with it were SO good too!  The negative would be the awful dessert.  I never had a square, light yellow, spongy, bitter and very egg tasting souffle before, I couldn't eat it.  But although the dessert was bad, the appetizer and entree were so over the top good I have to give this a 5 star!
