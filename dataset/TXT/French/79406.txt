Zl6csaZ5HBka3SKBphHXrQ Great little gem! I came in with my co-workers for summerlicious lunch. We got seated in 5 minutes. They had a strange waiting area inside by the washrooms. We liked the choices and the food was pretty good. We didn't come in with very strong opinions but the restaurant turned out to be a great choice. Service was very nice albeit slow. I felt sorry for her as she was the only one serving the entire restaurant! (Including bartending)
