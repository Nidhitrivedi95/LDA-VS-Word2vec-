A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g This is one of my favourite places to go in Las Vegas. I LOVE the sandwich and quiche section in the back, having been to France several times it reminds me of a cafe there. Except although the ingredients are as high quality, the portions are American sized. Go for the all day special which gets you a quiche or sandwich, a side of soup or salad (made in house) and a drink, which could be a cappuccino. Where else can you get all that for $10? Amazing. Their sweets are great too but I'm not much of a sweet tooth, I'll go for the croissants
