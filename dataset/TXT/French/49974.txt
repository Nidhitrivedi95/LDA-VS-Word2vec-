oS96aJIHFWcFAlGHKKXjaw Loveee! I've been here about 5 times and everything here is amazing. I ordered the "fraisier" cake for a birthday party and received tons of compliments.  Their pastries are to die for...not too sweet and buttery. I even tried their sandwiches which are also delish...especially the prosciutto sandwich.(love the tiny pickles)  What is there to complain? MAYBE...the size of the place is extremely tight with little room to sit to enjoy their baked goods.
