Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA Beautiful strip views. This is a great, great spot to stop for a few cocktails and enjoy the sights. My sangria was delicious and the rest of my group seemed to enjoy their drinks. I was a little disappointed with the apps selection and thought the food was just OK. The bathroom views are absolutely INSANE. Come for a drink on the outdoor patio, and make sure you go to the bathroom. Enough said.
