nkHaix6KenApS8M-liZsCQ If you like French food this is THE place to go in the valley. My wife spent many years in France as an exchange student, and she absolutely loves this place. French food isnt for everyone, but if you like it this is a place you need to visit.
I was educated on the whole wine/cheese thing the last time I was here. It was hard for me to figure out how the wine/cheese pairings played together, and I tasted what the big deal was with the appropriate pairings.
We typically go for the big 5/6 course tasting menus or special dinners they have. 
The service and food have all been excellent every time we have been.
