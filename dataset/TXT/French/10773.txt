4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I came to celebrate my friends birthday here with Norma Jean O. To really experience this place you HAVE TO SIT ON THE PATIO. It just brings a certain ambiance to it, and I can't deny, if they replaced our eccentric tourists with more sofisticated strollers, I'd be as close to the look and feel Paris as I can get. The view is worth the seating and price, and it really sets the mood for something intimate or toned down. Definitely an atmosphere to easily strike conversation.

I had the All Natural Chicken Breast with Frittes. It was a great dish, but the only thing I was really dissappointed about was the fact that the dish was nothing special. Nothing that makes Mon Ami's chicken breast different from any other joint that serves chicken breast. I'd expect a 5 star quality chicken experience for the price you pay for. The chicken was very tender, and it is a big portion of chicken so that made me feel a bit more satisfied. I watched my friends eat the escargot for appertizer. Honestly, it smelled delicous and sounded delicous, but my heart wasn't ready to try it so I passed on that one. But, if you have a strong stomach and heart, and have the courage to try it, I WOULD suggest to try it. I heard its amazing.

We pretty much knocked down a bunch of desserts in the end, but what I loved and remembered was the banana bread with ice cream. Soft and delicous, and it had that light crunch due to the walnuts. Yay!
