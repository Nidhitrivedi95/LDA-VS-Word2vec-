rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A If I could afford to go to Bouchon frequently, I would! Every bite of my food was heaven. For dinner I had the salmon (I don't remember the exact dish name) but it was so so sooo amazing. My friend got the steak and fries, which she loved! And goodness, they were not shy with the FRIES! For dessert we of course got to the Pot de Creme in coffee flavor. Sooo creamy and delicious. We got it again the next day for brunch haha.

I wish I could go into more detail, but it's been a few months since I last went. I'll have to re-review when I go back! WHEN I go back!
