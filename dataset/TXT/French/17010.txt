9ET_RUNztevq4_OLAX80Gg Had such a great time here this past weekend. 

We ordered the Canadian oysters, fries and Beignets de Calamar to share and everything was fantastic.  The ambiance was great with both the waitress and the bartender taking special care to make sure everything was to our liking.  The waitress was also very knowledgeable about the food she was serving us and explained how the sauces were made.  The view was great and the decor was perfect for the space. 

The drinks (our main focus) were delicious! The led zeppelin was great and the other drink i ordered was the most beautful cocktail i have ever been served (cant remeber the name sorry!)
