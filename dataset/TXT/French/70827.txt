xBxDMEkFK5GBhiy-8gGE9w I will leave it to others to give la Brasserie T more than 3 stars. I is a nice place, modern and elegant, and somewhat affordable. But I think it is overhyped and overpriced; for my own taste at least. I can imagine why many people would love it though. This is the place to go for a 100% safe dinner, if you are willing to pay 10-15$ too much for it. You are 100% sure to have a good service, fancy food well presented and a clean ambience. 
Maybe for a date, to be sure to feel comfortable, safe. Not for the adventurous. 
In my opinion, there are many restaurants in Montreal where you can get better food for a cheaper price; in a less 'sanitized' environment.
