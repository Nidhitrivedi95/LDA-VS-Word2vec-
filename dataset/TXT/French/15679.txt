6fPQJq4f_yiq1NHn0fd11Q Paris hotel's eatery specializing in made to order crepes. For $6.95 you can get a huge dessert or savory crepe...and you can watch it being made. The savory filings weren't that good though....too much egg in mine and too much prosciutto made for over saltiness in the other. Drinks are limited to bottled water, sodas and SoBe. Seating is right nextdoor.
