Yp9w4nhUowBU_IS_StFXbQ This place kind of sucks now. I have been coming to Tableau at least twice a year for a long time, and the last three times have been really disappointing. I went most recently in the second week of May 2012 for breakfast. I remember coming here and getting awesome, elaborate breakfast items that were meticulously prepared and completely delicious. Now you get pedestrian choices that are pretty "meh." 

I told the server that I had had a crab benedict there that I really enjoyed, he asked the chef if he could accommodate and the chef agreed. I got my crab benedict. It was a very boring and normal-looking eggs benedict but it had some wet crab meat slopped on it. Blah.

Service is amazing as always, everyone knows your name right away, and fresh squeezed orange juice is delicious of course. But the food, repeatedly, has been very meh. Las Vegas is not a city to be a "meh" restaurant in. On top of that, Tableau is retardedly expensive - two orange juices, a crab benedict and a regular benedict, tax and tip - $80.

I notice that for guests of the Tower Suites at the Wynn, all the food at Tableau is free.  I don't know how long they have been doing that, maybe it has contributed to a decline in quality as hitting food costs may no longer be relevant. I also understand that a new chef recently took over, which makes me even more sad, because at the beginning of a new chef's tenure he should be producing outstanding food to build a reputation. This is not really happening. Guests around us slogged through their overpriced breakfasts with blank, apathetic expressions. 

Tableau closed, then changed names, reopened, then changed names again, then got a new leader. Not surprising the food got left behind. Two stars for overpriced meh breakfast.
