A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g I. LOVE. This. Bakery.

----

I have an unhealthy obsession with French macarons. Whenever I come here, I order typically 10-20 at a time...just for me. They are just THAT good. Eating the macarons here just cheers me up and instantly makes my day better. 

One macaron is $1.25 I believe, and each one is made in house. The macarons here are large in size and have the perfect amount of cookie crunch balanced with flavorful, creamy filling/meringue. Every other bakery or café in town has generic, standard macarons (I'm looking at you, Sambalatte) that don't have that special homemade touch. 

They also have an incredible assortment of macaron flavors here as well. I have tried every flavor and my favorites are:

1. Pistachio (light, flavorful, and the pistachio meringue is divine)
2. Mango (perfectly crisp cookie with a melt-in-your-mouth mango fruit filling)
3. Rose (pink, girly, floral goodness)
4. Salted Caramel (it's salted caramel --trust me, it's good)
5. Everything else

Beyond the macarons, the other offerings this bakery has are lovely as well. My boyfriend loves their chocolate beignets and likes their eclairs as well. Their assortment of pastries differs slightly day to day here. 

Whether you're a macaron fiend like me or just want authentic French pastries, Manon is the place to be.
