0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g Disappointing. Unfortunately not worth the hype. The food was good, but nothing that I would remember. The service was what made it worse. It was Saturday night and we went for Menu Dégustation, with lamb choice for me and halibut for my wife. First, we waited for almost 20 minutes until our server came to explain the menu, and he didn't even mention there was another choice for the main course which wasn't on the menu- the duck, which we heard about from the neighbor table after we already ordered. After the first two courses we waited for at least 30 mins for the next one, and it came only after we explicitly asked about. The lamb and halibut were the biggest disappointments on the menu - both were just OK. My wife doesn't eat gluten/dairy, so they didn't have any desert options for her on the menu and the best they came up with was a bowl of berries. And they forgot to bring silverware for the desert, so we had to ask again for that. 
I expected so much more from this place but it wasn't the case, there're certainly better options on the strip.
