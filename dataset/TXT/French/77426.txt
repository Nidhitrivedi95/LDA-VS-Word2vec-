YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g Buddy and I had drinks and ate at the bar.  It was a Friday night but a little early so it was fairly quiet.  My buddy had Meesa wings and Sliders which he said we just OK,  I had caesar salad and gnocchi, both were just average.  Not good considering the tiny portions and slightly high prices.  Not that it affected my rating, but to make things worse, both my friend and I had upset stomachs the rest of the night, while he actually had bad diarrhea through the next day - let's just leave it at that.  I will say the bartender was really friendly and made us some good drinks.
