gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg Came here when the place was not busy. There were plenty of tables near windows and booths available. Couldn't get any of those nice tables for whatever reason. 

Instead were seated in some dark corner near the hall (alternative was to sit near a table with a large group of people). 

Left without ordering the food and will not come back.
