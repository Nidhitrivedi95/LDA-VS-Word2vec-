SCklYa_jhihWAcfIn-_chg Still searching for the best brunch in Toronto...and Bonjour Brioche has been the best thus far!  (I'm reserving my 5 stars for when I blown away!!!).

The spot is really cute -- we had a lovely seat on the side patio, which was quaint and perfect for a Sunday morning. The smells that are coming out of the bakery are just divine....and everything that is being served by the wait staff looks amazing!

The quiche was excellent!! Served with a cute bed of yummy greens, I have to say that the quiche was one of the best we've had in a while!  My partner-in-crime had eggs benny, which came out lovely as well.  The fresh veg/fruit juices complemented the breakfast perfectly, as did the hot cup of fresh coffee.  We couldn't resist having one of the sumptuous desserts after seeing them in the bakery window -- the lemon tart was very yummy and tasted exactly like you'd imagine buying one from a small little patisserie in France. MMMM.

YAY for Bonjour Brioche.  Still on the search for the best brunch in TO, but you're a memorable meal as the search continues.....
