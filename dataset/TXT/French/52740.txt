Tati was the perfect antidote to a snowy and slushy January day. I was immediately struck by their signage, which displays a part of its charm. Inside, it's all of the European bistro cliches you can think of: quaint, cozy, and warm. Because it's a small place, we were seated in the middle of the restaurant. I wouldn't normally like this but it worked. A note that it was a bit drafty inside. Bring a sweater! I really like the bar area as well. It's minimalism works. 

WE ATE 
I'm a sucker for French onion soup and Tati's didn't disappoint. It was all of the onion-y, salty flavour you could ask for. And they put plenty of cheese on top. I had the steak frites for my main. The steak was medium-well, juicy and tender. It was sizeable and I couldn't finish it. The accompanying fries were plentiful and a good mi of salty and savoury. At $31, I thought it was a bit pricey for its value. A Syrah was a good accompaniment. 

My dining companion had the beet salad and the sweetbreads. The salad was a very large portion and looked delicious. I had a taste of the sweetbreads and they were a bit meaty for my taste but she seemed to enjoy them. 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
Tati's unassuming nature and solid menu makes it a refreshing place to have a meal. It's a great date place but I feel like there was something missing in the food to make me a super fan. Nonetheless, I'll be back.
