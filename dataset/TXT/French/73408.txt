xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g I wanted to find a nice, romantic place for anniversary dinner with my wife and oh my goodness did I find the right one.  From beginning to end dinner at the Eiffel Tower Restaurant was perfect.

It starts with the private elevator from the hotel floor up to the elevated restaurant part way up the replica Eiffel Tower at the Paris hotel.  The elevator doors open up to a great view of the working kitchen and a friendly hostess there to guide us over to check-in.  The view is the first thing you notice as the walls are all windows and overlook the strip and particularly the Bellagio lake / water show.  Particularly for couples, all of the two person tables are right up next to the windows with amazing views.  The layout and settings are all beautiful and classy French steakhouse style.  The service, from beginning to end, was great as well.

The big surprise, for me at least, was that the food was amazing too!  I expected good food amplified by the setting and view, but the food was good enough to stand alone and even justify the hefty prices (at least along the strip).  I had the NY steak, which was one of the best steaks I  have had in a long time including some of the best steakhouses here in Los Angeles, and my wife had the Turbotin (fish) which she raved about as well.  Side dishes, souffle dessert, and wine/drink selections were all great as well.

Bottom line, if you want to splurge and have a really great dinner in a beautiful setting, this is the best place on the strip to do it.
