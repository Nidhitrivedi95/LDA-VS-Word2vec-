xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g It was our anniversary and Valentine's Day so we wanted to have a memorable, romantic dinner.  We chose the Eiffel Tower Restaurant with the ads promoting the view of the Belagio fountains and the sunset.  We were greeted by 3 hostesses and were seated immediately.  I had requested a table by the window and expressed that a few times.  However, we were seated at a table not only away from the windows but, with huge steal beam to look at.  I told the hostess we did not want to sit there.  We were seated at a table without a steal beam.  Other than that, the evening was perfect!  There was a prix fix meal which was 3 courses, delicious each one and presented to perfection. The service was impeccable and flowed seamlessly. We both were studying the wine list obviously trying to decide which wine we wanted.  The Somalia apparently saw that and came to the table to help us out.  Very observant..we liked that!   The wine he suggested and brought to us was a perfect pairing with our meal.

 I was able to see the fountains go off several times and people that did get to sit next to the windows had no problems with me standing behind them taking a few pictures.  We so enjoyed ourselves and certainly had a memorable and romantic dinner!  We  have now put the Eiffel Tower on the list of restaurants we must return to on future Vegas trips.  

There was one other little issue:  my husband's chair had no padding in it anymore.  He was squirming in his seat and finally told me that his chair was like sitting on concrete.  I told him to say something but, he wouldn't.  We looked at the chairs next to us and figured out that they need to be replaced.  They were pretty much showing a lot of wear and tear.  For not the fact that we were seated in front of a steal beam when asked several times to have a table with a view and the worn out chair, I'd give this restaurant 5 stars!  : )
