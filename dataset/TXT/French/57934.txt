rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Lovely atmosphere and French bistro setting but service and food not up to the hype. Server was rushed and obviously trying to turn over table quickly. No time to relax and peruse drink menu, asked us about dessert before dinner plates even removed. Check brought before one bite of dessert even eaten. I got roasted chicken which was overly salted and had me reaching for water rest of evening. Expensive and overrated in the end, would not return.
