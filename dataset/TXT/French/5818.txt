3OCooCzHgsS2xHdN-dNVXg Decor is amazing.  Scallop is huge and cook perfectly.  Fois gras is great (sorry duck, I just want to give it a try).  Seafood risotto was disappointing.  It' boring in term of taste and presentation.  Service is a bit slow, considering that there were only a few tables at the time.  Over all, I enjoy it.
