31KfCljxlb6zRS8r00lm2w After a visit to Oratoire St-Joseph, our party wanted a place to relax and have a coffee. A nice lady on the street pointed us toward the French flag - and we invaded!

There were 7 of us (which included 2 children) - and we wanted a seat on the patio. And wow, did these folks accommodate. They moved around tables and chairs, and even made some poor guy reading a book switch seats so we could take over. I felt a bit guilty about this, but they seemed happy to make us feel welcome.

We had already taken a look at the sweets inside, so we pretty much knew what we wanted. The waiter came and sat down to take our order - someone asked for a menu - he said, "I am the menu!" Very sweet.

The macaroon I ordered was dry. Everyone else enjoyed their desserts. It cost more than our lunch. This is the only reason I don't give the place 5 stars. Otherwise, really enjoyed the place!
