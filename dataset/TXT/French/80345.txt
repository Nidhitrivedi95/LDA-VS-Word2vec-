zYmbEXJb-VZ41GOTGSxjIg Happy to have this little bistro so close to home :)
Everything I ordered was delicious. Crab cakes are really good and I especially liked the green apple slaw that it came with. I tried the Mac and cheese, beef and salmon tartar. The only thing I wasn't too into was the shredded hard boiled egg on top of the salmon tartar. Tartar was good I just felt like it cheapened the taste of the dish. This was all take out so I will def take time to go dine at the restaurant one day soon.
Hopefully this restaurant sticks around as up to now the only restaurant that has succeeded in this location is Mundo which has grown and is now on St-Charles.
