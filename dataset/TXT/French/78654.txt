ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug After playing poker until 1:30am...my hubby & I went to look for a place where we can get some chow before going back to our room in Bally's.  We found this place in Paris and I ordered Steak & Eggs.... I can definitely say that anything and everything tastes great when you're tired, hungry & sleepy!

If you're not too sleepy, then you'll get to notice all those young people that are so wasted and can barely walk or eat.... it woke me up from my sleepy mode...as if I'm watching reality TV while eating! LOL!!!!
