Very casual and relaxed vibe, with a sensational cocktail menu.  The waitress that helped us was very friendly, and the bartenders were very knowledgeable and accommodating to creative substitutes.  The bar seemed to be located in a quieter area though, which made it a tiny bit uncomfortable to get to from our hotel on Sherbrooke on a very cold winter day.

The Tic & Tac Sour changed my life, and all of their other drinks were just as wonderful.  It was one of my favorite stops in Montreal...I just wish it wasn't so far away from me (as in, another country)!
