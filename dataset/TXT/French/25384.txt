Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA Probably one of the worst lounges/clubs in Vegas!  First, you have to wait in a huge line to get in AND out of the place because of the elevator.  Second, the drinks were crap and overly priced for a place like this.  Third, the staff was very rude to both the ladies and men in our group.  Fourth, the music SUCKED ASS (TOTAL GHETTO MUSIC!!!).  Lastly, the vibe is horrible because of the decor.  All black everything.  

I guess this is where the old, ugly, fat people go.....
