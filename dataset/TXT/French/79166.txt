ZdaZwXC0FByDY3EwNELphw - everyone who has written a review talks about the elk sliders. yes, they are damn good. bambi is delicious.
- will have to come back again for the sticky ribs, as they were all out by the time our group arrived.
- ambiance here is great, and it was pretty busy for a tuesday night. (must be the half price bottle of wine special they have going on)
- our server was very attentive, and although she didnt know what amaretto was (maybe they dont have it in australia), she did pour up a seriously good caesar. habanero (sp?) and soy sauce made this thing realllllly good. #2 in the city, in my opinion.
