ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug The food was good and has a nice atmosphere but the service was bad.  No one was at the entrance to greet and seat you, when I was seat no one came to my table.  No water, no bread, no waiter.   When the waiter came, he was very nice but the process was slow. Long wait between bread and meal. No one notice I was finished eating. The entire experience was tainted. Too bad.
