eUjDWzbQ6eLZy0uELEOa9Q The interior design is the best part of the experience here-- we chose on of the tiny pine booths perched like a line of love nests. Acoustics for conversation were nice. 

The maitre d' was professional.

Points of contention:

- Our server sneakily upsold us into a 1/2 liter of sauvignon blanc that cost more than buying by the individual glass...hm. Economics 101, anyone?

- My cod was OK, the beach mushrooms were delicious, but overall the dish was so salty that my engagement ring won't fit on my bloated sausage finger tomorrow, for sure. Salt and butter taste good, don't get me wrong. 

- I told the server of my gluten intolerance, and yet I was served an encrusted amouse bouche-- sketchy! He seemed to forget of the wheat allergy when offering table bread and during our dessert ordering. Given that the place was half full, it could hardly have been too much to remember. 

My fiancee's pork chop with caramelized onions was yum and served with a hot pot of adorable gnocchi that were almost too cute to eat-- I just wanted to coo at them and how chewy they looked. "Sigh, gluten!"

The bill was over $150, and I didn't even have a starter. And we both had only 1 glass of wine. I suppose we paid for the atmosphere.
