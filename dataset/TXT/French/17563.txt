9OaeSZ-JqYSnOTWP3GD2rg We had a wonderful lunch today, get there before noon as this small resto fills up quickly. So much fun to watch the chefs working behind the small bar cooking interesting and inspired food. 

My tip centers around the wine selection. One of the partners is a private wine importer and has a good selection of natural wine, currently becoming very trendy in Paris. These hard to find, small producer wines go beyond just bio and include all facets of the production and vinification of wine. Can't find any of these in the SAQ, at least not intentionally. By the glass or bottle treat yourself to something new.
