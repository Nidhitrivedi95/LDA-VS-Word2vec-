YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g Wow ... truly a must experience. I got chills three times while eating here. Once for the ahi Tartar, twice for the filet mignon and third for wrapped. Chorizo ... which I did not know was French but I guess after Mexico's defeat of them they retreated back with a little recipe. Either way I loved the atmosphere and attentive staff.
