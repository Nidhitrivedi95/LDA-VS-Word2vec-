lcTa0q9Wo4wNyLCIgWFRUA Came here while on vacation, it happened to be restaurant week. Easily made a reservation via email, and was really excited to come. 

We arrived around 6, a little earlier than our reservation and the place was EMPTY. We wanted to leave but there was no going back as we were ushered to our seats. We were nervous to say the least. Why was it empty?!

Cool atmosphere. 

The waitress initially seemed like a stuck up snob, but by the end of the night (2 hours) she was actually pretty awesome. Fast, nice, eventually willing to communicate in English with us (I know, it's your country and you speak French there. Awesome, but help a girl out. My French only goes so far). 

It's hard to talk about the food. We've never had this type of cuisine before, and I think we just didn't appreciate it. It wasn't great and I left hungry and disappointed. Again, I think it's because I've never had bone marrow, fore gras....If this was a type of food I liked, maybe I'd have been more impressed. 

The drinks were tasty and awesome. I liked the Kungfu Girl Reisling, but was rather bummed that I learned how cheap it is outside in the real world- I definitely got ripped off at La Societe. 

The dessert was AMAZING.
