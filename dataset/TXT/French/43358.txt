LtDYRcMJbJPhXPEklT29Fw What an amazing concept for Cleveland!  Edwins is not a name - it stands for education wins.  It is a place for "second chancers" who want to learn culinary arts skills.  
The building itself is rustic looking and very romantic.  It fits the mood for french cuisine.  Even the TV was in black and white the night we dinned.  
Our table had filets, salmon, market fish, seafood sausage and lobster bisque.  Not out of this world,  but great quality!  The sever was Very attentive and served our Very yummy meals.  
The dessert course was outstanding.  The creme brûlée was delicious and the most light preparation I've ever had.  Really good. 
The bananas foster tableside was also excellent. Nom. Nom. Nom.  
Great concept, great ambiance, great food.
