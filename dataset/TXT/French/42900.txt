LnSjzFXh1GrOObsRP6LhBQ Went there few times, the pear almond tart is amaaaazing, the prices can be too much for sandwiches or pastries. The soups are very good. Why not 5 stars? the customer service is not consistent. You can be served by a rude person and another time by a friendly one. On sunday the team is more helpfull even if it s busy. One sunday they didn t have black chocolate for a mocha. the barista (with a funny french accent) gived me a white chocolate to try. What a good surprise!! Now i am crazy about white mocha!
tips: go on sunday or before lunch. broccoli cheddar soup and onion quiche are amazing and for only 11$ you have your combo.
