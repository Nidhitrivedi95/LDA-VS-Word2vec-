qmh6zxtJ8C8-YiUPv7ySlw Not the best Michelin Star restaurant I have experienced.

We celebrated our bdays here and sat outside on the terrace with a great view of the waterfall. They had some waterfall shows, some of which were whacked. I mean, seriously, a chick's head coming out of the water, mouthing "Oh yeaaaaaaaah" with splashing neon colors was more distracting than it was entertaining. It was an acid trip and a half. Not an ideal romantic setting. Steve Wynn, you can do better than that.

My friend ordered the DB burger ($32) and I ordered from the prix fixe menu: pumpkin soup, steak frites, and ice creams ($48).

- Pumpkin soup - it reminded me of Trader Joe's Pumpkin soup in a box. I am sure it was fresh, but it wasn't that great in flavor. Maybe adding ginger and doing something more Michelin-ratish would help.

-Steak Frites - the steak was sirloin cut. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't memorable. The french fries were ok, nothing compared to McD's.

- Ice creams were my favorite. The coffee and pistachio flavors were fresh, flavorful, and creamy. Fantastic.

Service was superb, meals were prompt, efficient, and the staff was friendly and down-to-earth. Not a "stuffy" place at all and my family appreciated that. 

Next time, I will book their prestigious restaurant, Alex.

But I was NOT impressed here.
