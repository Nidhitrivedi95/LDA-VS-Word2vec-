SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA Okay, sorry not too impressed.

The atmosphere is cosy.  The service was attentive, and genuinely friendly...
I think most folks here want something genuine, not pretentious, and I can attest that this spot should get high marks for the atmosphere and the staff. I do appreciate that the servers were professional, courteous, and had a nice sense of humor.

I was just disappointed with what we ordered, and was hoping for more from a special night out.  The mussels and pomme frites were over-salted, though the mussels were tender and cooked well.  The pizza we ordered was a little ridiculous.  It was pretty comical when they placed a plate down, with what turned out to be just a gooey mess of cheese that you might expect to be a 3$ item from a food truck.  Dessert was okay, not great.  Yes, we were just there for drinks and snacks, not dinner.  But we were pretty incredulous that our food was so expensive... and not too sensational.  I went in with high expectations, and went home a little bewildered.  If you work hard for your money, you might want to skip this place.
