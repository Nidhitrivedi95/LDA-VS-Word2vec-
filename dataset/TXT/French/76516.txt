Yp9w4nhUowBU_IS_StFXbQ Like other restaurants at the Wynn & Encore, Tableau has vegetarian & vegan menus. It is an elegant but casual restaurant with nice decor & lots of views outside so you get light. Service is very good. I was offered a complimentary newspaper after being seated for breakfast. Food is expensive, but falls within Las Vegas strip range. The food, however, is very good. I had the blueberry pancakes which were vegan along with vegan sausage. I have posted a photo of my meal & the vegetarian breakfast & lunch menu. They are very good about also telling you what is vegan.
