qltrxd6_usFu1Q0mM5ZCNQ After walking up and down Rue St. Denis, I chose La Fabrique because it seemed like a local place and the food looked good from the window.  Menus are available in French and English.  Selections were innovative, including one allowing the chef to make something of his whim.  I had a hard time deciding on several possibilities, but was happy with my choice of beef with scallops, herb gnocchi, some perfectly cooked zucchini strips and olives in a well flavored sauce. What was nice about the restaurant was the complimentary special touches, like the warm toasted peasant bread with chive spread, large jar of delicious homemade pickles, and even pink cotton candy for a special ending.  Although my entree was more than enough for me, I wanted to try the french fries fried in duck fat.  The waiter accommodated by giving me a small sample in a little container.  Absolutely decadent!
