rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw I had an absolutely delicious meal here. We arrived a little early so we grabbed a drink at the bar. Attentive bartenders and a great selection of liquor. The hostess came by to grab us when our table was ready and almost immediately our server arrived with a bottle of water. We opted for the Summer in Provence tasting menu and the wine pairings. We both selected the tuna tartare, the scallops, sea bass, and strawberry pavlova. The alcohol pairings allowed for either a wine with each course of cocktail/beer. Our server was incredibly accommodating and said it would be no problem if I wanted to try the cocktail with my first course since I really wanted to try "And God Made Woman." 

First, the food was amazing. The portions were good and the wine with each course was delicious. And damn if that "And God Made Woman" cocktail wasn't worth asking the server for a sub. Seriously, get a glass, it's awesome. 

Having never had strawberry pavlova, I was super surprised by the presentation and now I'm going to research how to make it at home because it was just that good.

Hands down one of the most expensive meals we've ever had, but we both agreed we'd come back. I mean, I don't know what else to say, it's just really good. Also, say yes to the bread when they ask.
