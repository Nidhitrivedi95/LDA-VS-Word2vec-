h_ypoQ2rmwX8UGSmohsGiQ I have searched for love and I have now found love. I have tasted its intoxicating, delicious fruit. I am walking on clouds from its weightlessness, And like any budding relationship, I must protect us. I must protect it from glomming over it. From nauseating insecurity and selfishness. I must give it room to breathe and grow and evolve.

I ate the lavender, blueberry loaf and it is moist, heavenly and absolutely delicious. It is not a heavy slice of cake. The lavender icing is a touch of heaven! I felt so relaxed as I enjoyed each morsel. Letting the blueberries explode in my mouth. Letting the lavender caress my lips.

At a little under $4, this is a treat to be enjoyed sporadically. That and the fact I want to keep my waistline.
