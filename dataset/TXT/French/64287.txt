tCSlpwJQ4CZsUEMZeH2SFg I knew I came to the right place with the crowd flowing in on a rainy Saturday afternoon. We were lucky enough to beat most of the crowd and immediately started off with the beignets. Light, flaky, warm - perfect snack as I debate the many options on the menu. 

I ended up going with the short rib sandwich - the nasty weather left me wanting something warm and rich. This sandwich delivered; tender short rib bathing in provolone alongside sautéd mushrooms and onions with a garlic aioli, topped with arugula to cut through some of that richness. 

Others at my table ordered the tuna melt, chicken salad, and BLT. All received top compliments.  

Service exceeded my expectations, especially for the lunch hours. Our server knew the menu down to each ingredient and made great recommendations. 

I am looking forward to trying the rest of the menu.
