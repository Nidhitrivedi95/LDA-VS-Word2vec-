cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg My family took me here for a belated birthday years ago, and I still can remember that meal. 

I just remember that we had a lot of foie gras dishes and duck. I believe the best was the Foie Gras Poutine. I can drink a gallon of that gravy. 

Usually duck and foie gras are not exactly my cup of tea, but it was amazing here. 

I was just watching Anthony Bourdain and he just mentioned foie gras, so it triggered my memories in Montreal. Definitely would come back and eat here again... and again... and again.
