xcmmTXhuMx2fZF2Bt69F4w Just had the most awesome lunch at this small, friendly cafe in Pittsburgh's charming Point Breeze neighborhood. Flatbread with a carrot-ginger puree, creme fraiche, fresh berries and watercress. OMG so good! And unusual. Hubby raved over the daily special of seared scallops over warm watercress salad. Point Brugge is very popular, and there is often a wait. (They do not take reservations.) If you are in a hurry, this is not a good choice. It's more of a take your time and relax kind of place. Okay for kids, but not kid-oriented. It's an adult kind of venue. NOT wheelchair accessible; there is a short flight of steps, often clogged with people waiting for a table. Specialties are the double-fried, ultra-crispy, Belgian-style frites (worth every hyphen), the mussels in a variety of sauces, and a wide variety of yummy Belgian beers. There is a small outdoor seating area on a relatively quiet corner, so when the weather permits, you can sit outside and eavesdrop on the people standing around waiting for tables. Did I mention it's popular? We live four blocks away, and we only go at about 3:00 in the afternoon when it's raining, which it was today, otherwise I'd have missed that awesome flatbread!
