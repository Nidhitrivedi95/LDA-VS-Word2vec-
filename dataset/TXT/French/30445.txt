FUX9h1a37GJn9ge1baiNuw I don't consider myself an expert in French pastries by any means, but these were the best pastries I have ever had. I had a macaron, which was perfectly made and absolutely delicious, and a tarte au poire (pear tart) which was fantastic. I also took a fresh baguette home & can't wait to try that as well.

The owners speak French, but even with the language barrier (I know some French but am not anywhere near fluent) they were incredibly helpful, friendly, and really fun. My mother in law says their croissants are the best she has ever had, but they were out of them since we came so late in the afternoon. I would recommend getting there in the morning to try one, we will definitely be doing that ourselves. 

In addition to pastries they also have a large selection of sandwiches and quiche available if you would like to order lunch, as well as coffee and espresso drinks and other beverages. It was so worth the drive from Verona! We will be coming back!
