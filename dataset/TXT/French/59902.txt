Crazy creative and most of it works incredibly well.  Pricey, but better food, show and experience than the other 5 stars in Vegas.

Lesser known, but you can bring your own wine (Corkage is steep) and enjoy a bottle you know you love with this awesome meal.  Brought a mag of '99 Insignia and had the meal of the decade.
