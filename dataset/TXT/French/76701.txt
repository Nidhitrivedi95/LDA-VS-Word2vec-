Yp9w4nhUowBU_IS_StFXbQ Loved EVERY thing about it.  I am not a big meat eater but my husband and I decided to have their burger for lunch.  It was huge and amazing.  The decor and atmosphere was just beautiful.  The staff was sweet as pie.  I also had the carmalized yams.....Yummy!!!  Worth every penny.  Sure $16 for a burger is a bit much, but when you on vacation and you are in Vegas, who cares.  Life is short so spend it if you can.

I will be back in Vegas in a couple of weeks and will be trying the breakfast.
