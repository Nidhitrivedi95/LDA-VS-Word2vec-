MhFoFpLBx_Fy8gs9dlwtGA I had been hunting for a reasonably priced French restaurant to visit while I was in Montreal and Yelp came to the rescue.  Au Petite Extra is just a short walk from the very popular Plateau and Latin Quarters and worth the trip.  The decor looks very traditional French with bar seating if you are dining alone.  Attire ranged from casual to dressy, like much of Montreal you can pretty much do your own thing.  

We were given some time to look over the menu and after placing our order I asked the server to help choose between two wines for our meal.  The one she suggested (a shiraz) was excellent.  The food prep took a while so we had finished half the wine before our meals arrived.  What came out was excellent though, I had a grilled fillet with a sideof frites.  The only minus on my meal was the dip for the fries, it was a little bland.  My companion had the smoked pork which was also very good.  The aromas coming from other tables were quite appealing, if I visit the city again I hope to return here.
