T2leBbQ41BEHVJxxhkt_FA Two friends and I decided to try the new French bistro in Henderson. We're glad we did because we loved it. Done or one ordered. An appetizer of chive cream cheese wrapped in salmon that was absolutely delicious. So was the yellow lentil soup  ($6) with the puff pastry rolls on the side. Diner two and I started all with a delicious cheesy French onion soup  ($8)  then ordered  the chicken Cordon Bleu ($15) which comes with a delicious Lemon butter  sauce -and a little cup of extra sauce. The chicken breast was on a bed of creamed vegetables nestled in a puff pastry square.  A little side salad with terrific raspberry vinaigrette was fresh and made this an excellent choice  
Service from our waitress,  Ruby Tuesday, yes that's really her name, was spot on. She stayed with us to make sure we didn't well taken care of without being intrusive and she had a great bubbling personality. We loved her.  
Yanni was closing tonight for about two weeks while they revamp to add a Greek  menu along with the delicious French cuisine.  Looking forward to that because we all love Greek food.
The menu is small but that was OK because we had a tough time choosing between three or four things that sounded so good,  but fortunately we live in the neighborhood can return to try the rest of the menu.
Do give this new place a try. I think you'll like it. It's located at the far end of the Kmart shopping plaza on Eastern and Coronado Center Drive.
