cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg I pied my cochon the food was do dam f'n good.  I poo'd my cochon being so bloated after the meal.  All jokes aside this dinner we had was fantastic. From the foie gras Poutine, foie gras burger, and the Duck in a can. They could not have cooked the food any better. Service did not exceed my expectation, but I was too busy and happy stuffing my face in foie gras. &
