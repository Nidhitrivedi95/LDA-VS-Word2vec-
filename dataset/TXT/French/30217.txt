FRuuIDOd21pTJHvEGIt1Gg We came here for a meal with my grandparents and had a lovely time. The staff were attentive but not bothersome. They kept the water and wine glasses filled so we could enjoy our evening together. We managed to sample a good chunk of the menu between all of us and it was absolutely delightful. 

It was an enjoyable evening, with great ambiance, courteous and unobtrusive service, and tasty food--everything I could ask for when taking my grandparents out in Montreal.
