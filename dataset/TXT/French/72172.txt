XKPosZx2j4RHcZ8Ewdwj0A Good enough. A - OKAY

In a city like Montreal where the food standard is very high, Lemeac is a 3 star joint to me. 

If Lemeac were in another town, like in the prairies or midwest USA, it would be 4 or 5 stars.

The food was good. It wasn't bad. I didn't have complaints. The atmosphere was fine, although I found it to be slightly boring.

It didn't impress me much, but if you feel like going somewhere with a solid selection of food that is decent, go here.
