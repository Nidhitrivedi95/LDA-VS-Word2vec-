SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ I would normally give this restaurant a 5 star but not now. 
I would go there in the evening but never for lunch for the next two years while a Multi story apartment building is being built across the street. The noise is Beyond belief. 
My advice is stay away during lunch and only go at night.
