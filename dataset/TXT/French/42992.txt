LQ_gYNs5E10IGFE0NOyD7A I like this place. Small but comfortable. My colleagues and I went there for a quick lunch. They have a power lunch menu which has a balanced selection of items. Power lunch suggests quick preparation and delivery to your table . . . They did a nice job!!

I ordered the bistro steak over a salad . . . Flavors were amazing and I absolutely loved the raspberry vinegarette. My colleagues ordered a kale salad with a side of salmon and seemed very happy with their choice. One of our colleagues is a "meat and potatoes" kind of guy and ordered a sandwich that he did not eat. The server quickly came over and asked him if everything was ok. He also asked if he could get him something else. The sandwich looked amazing, but our colleague is a very finicky eater. The server removed the sandwich from the bill. I loved the way the server handled it, he seemed genuinely concerned. I love great customer service! 

Great service and the food had very nice flavors. It was quick and delicious.

I highly recommend Upton for a nice lunch and creative menu.
