jLxeBgWhLRbII2ACkgH1Sg When I think of a good Sunday breakfast or brunch I always start craving French cuisine. We have eaten here a few times and every single time we dine I am blown away by the flavors that dance on my tastebuds. My favorite dish is the salmon and brioche, it is a buttery and beautiful creation that takes me straight to France.  Such a great place!!
