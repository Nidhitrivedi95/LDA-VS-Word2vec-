HL6ZzGF7V-KDaU0zziHyEA Fancy brunch spot - beautiful space and garden - grub is just ok.  If you order the buffet, you'll practically get everything on the menu - but it is not that spectacular and pastries did not seem fresh.  The 2 eggs special with bacon or sausage was fine.  The goat cheese n fig quiche was a winner for the buffet.  I was expecting more from a Boulud resto. The Mimosas made the experience divine. Service was swift and everyone very accommodating. If you're feeling fancy after you've checked out of the Ritz, Boulud might fit your bill. However, it would probably be better to take an Uber to one of the many little bistros that this beautiful city has to offer.  Would I come back for a $200 brunch for 3? Prolly not , but I definitely see myself drinking mimosas in their garden again! Merci for that!
