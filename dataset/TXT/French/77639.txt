YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g fleur de lys was delicious! i had the 4 course tasting menu and everything was good, from the little amuse bouche (a tiny piece of fried cod with a tiny taste of potato salad) to the dessert, which was my favorite part. (the tiny peanut butter shake was more peanutty than peanut butter itself, and so cute!) the truffled onion soup was also fantastic. i can't actually remember what i had for the second course... i'm sure it was tasty, if, apparently, rather forgettable. third course was the filet mignon; very good as well. the service was excellent and the restaurant itself was a super cool space with big, tall ceilings and a warm, comfortable feel.

i would suggest that you allot plenty of time when dining here; the pace is relaxed, which isn't a bad thing and gives you lots of time to savor your meal; i just wish i hadn't been so stressed about making it to the tour we had reservations for after our meal.
