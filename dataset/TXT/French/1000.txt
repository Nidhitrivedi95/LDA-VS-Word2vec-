_cjPEH9wXhKS-HQe_U3M4Q This place is so perfect! Came here with my parents when they were in town before the Jays game. Made a reservation for 11 and we sat outside in the front. It did fill up by the time we left so definitely make a reservation. Food was delicious, I got the cheese omelet. They have a back patio as well. Overall, very nice, classy, relaxed place. Will definitely be back to sip some rosé and enjoy delicious French food!
