EG3drsohiIrBewmOYMNEuA This restaurant was recommended by our concierge on our first night and I have to say, I was disappointed.  My friend had the calamari and shrimp which was tasteless.  The escargot was not what it should taste like and was covered with oil and baked cheese.  I ordered a chicken dish with rice and salad which was also tasteless.  I do have to say at least the chicken was not dried.  But not a fan.
