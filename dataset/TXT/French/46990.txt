nWW6fBfBljiRFa4sG7TyxA The Event Booze and Burlesque is what we were hired for, From the entry to the restaurant the atmosphere was just right with all the staff, The drinks were phenomenal the show girl was particularly our favorite. They were tasty but strong and we are not complaining about that for sure!.. The food taco wise was heaven the pork belly was delish and we would have just eaten all the tacos if we could have but we had work to do... We really liked that place and will come back for more!
