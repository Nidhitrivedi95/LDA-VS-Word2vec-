ovtlrcsVRlgZZQUlHs_ovw Simply needed a night out of the house and refused to cook, so Vouge being "that go to place" in Surprise I ventured out to try it again during the week and not on a holiday.... I tried the Salmon with an poor excuse of some greens plated next to it... The salmon was good enough but not a wow. Mac and cheese for my lil one was more the palatable for him. I also sampled the meat loaf (nice, lil on the dry side for me) I asked for my favorite Congac that they didn't have. The waiter recommend Kelt Congac  (never tried before ) let me just say, I heard the angels sing people!..... What a great Congac! (Kelt XO).... A must if you love perfection.....  Again, the atmosphere is a wow! Staff a wow! Come on Chef. .. do your thing! Show surprise the wow factor! Please... Surprise needs a wow!
