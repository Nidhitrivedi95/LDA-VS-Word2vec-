Dcj69NZJnbJhK-YHP_nULA Excellent Wisconsin Belgian beer & fare delight. Atmosphere was cozy, classic/elegant with a twist of sophistication. The pommes frites were some of the best I've had as well as aioli. My friend got the an amazing salad that he couldn't finish (really- it was deceptively large!) and I tried the gnocchi (larger than usual) with mushrooms and cream sauce that was delicious. I wish we were more in the mood for beer tasting since the listing was impressive...
