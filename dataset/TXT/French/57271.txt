rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Best restaurant in Vegas! I came here with my boyfriend for his birthday. We've heard great things about this place and the recommendations were on point. I order the seafood tower, the pate, salmon spread and the French onion soup. The seafood tower consisted of 1 lobster,  raw oysters from both coasts, raw clams,  mussles and shrimp. The oysters and clams were briny and perfect. The shrimp was half the size of the lobster tail. The pate came with roasted bread, radishes, spinach leaves and mustard. The salmon spread came with toasted baguette slices. It was thick like cream cheese but smooth when gliding on the baguettes. Talk about two savory spreads.They did not need any sauces for flavor. The Great service and ambiance. Will definitely come again!
