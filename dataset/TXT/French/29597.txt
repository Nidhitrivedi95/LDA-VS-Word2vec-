FChZqoNWuLZr5Lj28Cq7yg Had breakfast here this morning and was super excited to try this cute place out. Atmosphere and interior is adorable so I was looking forward to a similar food experience. I got the spinach, tomato, mozzarella quiche with scrambled eggs on the side. Maybe I didn't order the right thing but sadly I wasn't impressed at all :( my friend ordered the goat cheese and leek quiche with a waffle on the side and I tasted both of her items. The quiches were tasty but nothing out of the ordinary. The layyonaise potatoes that are included with every dish weren't that great either. Potatoes and scrambled eggs had no other seasoning besides huge pieces of black peppercorn, which can be very overpowering. The liege waffle was decent, but a little bit on the dense side, I have has better. And finally, their dessert case only had 3 items in it and none of them were calling my name :/
