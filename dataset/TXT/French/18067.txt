A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g Man oh man, do I wish this place was closer to me. I guess, it's actually a good thing it's not, or i would be going there almost every day. 

Aside from the most recent time I went, service has always been great. Always friendly. Never too long of a wait for food. 

Man, their quiches are so damn good. I get so angry at them every time I eat one of their quiches because mine just never quite measure up. i don't know how they get them so perfect every time. From the crust to the filling, everything is just so damn tasty. I will say though, the only one I've tried that I haven't been a big fan of is their chili one. I didn't quite like the how the quiche was kind of liquidy because o the chili. They do have a quiche special, where you get a quiche, soup or salad, and drink for only $8.95.

Cassoulet & Beef bourbignon are also two things that should be checked out. The cassoulet [ i do hope I'm spelling that right], is mainly pork, with sausage, bacon, and white beans served with a couple pieces of bread. The beef bourbignon consists of beef [duh] , carrots, onions, and pasta also served with a couple pieces of bread. You get this cute little pot full, all for 9.95 ! 

they have so many pastries there, it's ridiculous. I've only tried a handful of things myself, but most of it was pretty good. I was a little disappointed by their eclairs, but that was no biggie. 

All in all, a great place to go. I'll never get tired of eating their quiches.
