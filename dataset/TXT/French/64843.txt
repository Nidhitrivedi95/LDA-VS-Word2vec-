TgjgHz-QRrv60QKYZ-qmMg While visiting Montreal, we ventured from our nearby hotel to catch some food and drink in a busy part of town. The atmosphere on the patio with nearby bars and restaurants make it a wonderful spot to visit. The food was excellent and the home make brew/beer is just as good! This is a great spot to people watch on a hot summers day!
