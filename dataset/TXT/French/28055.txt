DZkl5MleRKh0isxj1Y2Abg We had dinner for the first time at Chabrol last night and I will be sure to return for another close encounter.
For starters, I had the Riesling poached Foie Gras, which was very tasty and my wife was thrilled with her Cured Trout, which melted in the mouth. 
I was blown away with my main, which was what the chef calls Ttoro; the best way I can describe this dish is the very best Bouillabaisse I have ever had. Period. The broth was so delicious that I would have been very happy to have it without the accompanying fish and seafood. It was that good. The fish was too, by the way. Would have made any decent chef in Marseilles proud to serve. My wife had the braised lamb with fennel, which she enjoyed very much. Not a speck to be found on either plate as they made their way off the table. 
We shared a tart tatin for dessert., which was bathed in a most ethereal cream sauce, and it still retained a very nice crisp texture on the pastry.
It was all produced on a two burner cooktop by the chef alone. No sous chef in sight. Really a treat to watch, which you could do from every seat in the house.
Very attentive staff, and a bartender who pours a great martini!
