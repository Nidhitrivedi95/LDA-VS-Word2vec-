rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I've been here several times over the last couple years. I going to review my dinner and breakfast experience. Even though dinner can be very good I think their breakfast is exceptional. Pricy, yes, but about as good as you can find anywhere. 

Dinner last night was good but not as good as it has been in the past. The small seafood platter was excellent with high quality raw oysters and clams from both the west and east coasts. Two beautiful jumbo shrimp half a lobster tail and plump black mussels were also very very good. The sauces that accompany the seafood were just ok so I stuck with the horseradish and lemon. The steak frite was disappointingly tough with tough grissly parts and the fries were cold and hard. Sautéed spinach was very good but the garlic confit was not meltingly tender and rich. It had a slight bitter edge. I still ate everything and enjoyed it. The martinis here were good not great missing one of our requests. The house haut medoc Bordeaux by the glass was much better than expected. Great service rounded out our meal.

I must say, breakfast was perfect. Their American breakfast is perfectly executed and I feel it's a bargain. Attentive service again at breakfast was appreciated at the early hour we were there.

Dinner 4 stars
Breakfast 5 stars
