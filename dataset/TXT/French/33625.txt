From the subtle wafting aroma of fresh bread , To the beautiful display case featuring hand crafted pastries and  delicate morsels of pure bliss. The service was kind and professional, and I was reminded of  the well mannered nature of people from the south of France. Please, I encourage all foodies and those that desire a formidable dose of opulent cuisine at a very reasonable cost. Visit this cafe, you shall NOT be disappointed.
