rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A We tried to go to Bouchon for brunch the first day we were in Vegas but they had stopped serving, so we decided to go for dinner instead. Wow what a good idea that was, we defiantly chose wisely. First off our waitress was excellent, and the decor is lovely. By far the best thing about this restaurant is the food, and isn't that what really matters!
my husband and I shared our appetizers, we got the lobster tart which was a daily special, and the fresh and smoked salmon rillettes. The tart was great, but the rillette was so good I could have taken a bath in the stuff and been very happy! The rillette comes in a small mason jar and my husband and I polished off the whole thing. Our main dishes were also fantastic. When we found out that there was also one in Napa we were very pleased, as we come from the Bay area. The next time we go wine tasting we will defiantly try the Bouchon there.
