I even like ducking in and sitting at the breakfast bar for a quick brunch.  The place is packed on the weekends.  My favorite breakfast dish there is a riff on eggs benedict; crab cakes (instead of an english muffin), topped with spinach, a poached egg and hollandaise sauce. It's served with red potatoes or fruit.  They also have a really nice oatmeal served with brown sugar, raisins, nuts - a high water mark on the comfort food chart for me.
