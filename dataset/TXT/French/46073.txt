MxHZ5XwIQWnJFTw9gZxAIg This place is wonderful!  The food is delicious, the staff attentive, the decor is beautiful and they were also wonderful with our young child.  What a lovely find in The Grassmarket; a more trendy young atmosphere.  The only strange thing is the smell that sometimes comes in from the cheese shop below.
