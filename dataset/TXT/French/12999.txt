4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Good restaurant. Party of 2 went just before brunch ended on Friday morning. We had about a 15 minute wait. Perfect day to sit on the patio facing the Bellagio. French toast was good and so was the croissant. The portions aren't too big so a little pricey for the amount of food you get.
