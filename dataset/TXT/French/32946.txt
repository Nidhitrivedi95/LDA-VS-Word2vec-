OMG I just regret to eat poutine at the old montreal area which somebody recommend at a travel book. It was so expensive and they served normal fries which is same with Mcdonald's french fries. And I paid $18 included tips. And I was disappointed about poutine. But I just change mind. It was good poutine I ate at 5am this restaurant. I just stop by montreal to go to mont-tremblant. I serched yelp then I found here. It was good and  I will recommend to my homies.
