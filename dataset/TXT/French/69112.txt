w2tr0PA0b3tg8pId0kjM-A Gaby Et Jules is a pretty good bakery. It's very striking and modern looking compared to the rest of Squirrel Hill. The selection inside is small and the prices are high. I bought a box of macarons and I enjoyed most of them. The lavender was my favorite, the salted caramel was okay and the white chocolate basil was the worst of the seven. The girl working the counter was very helpful and gave me some pretty good suggestions. Not bad but not my favorite.
