t1mR_Zff6Dqv1TueE2JLEA Decided to try out this restaurant for a different experience and it did provide that, and also had a great ambience as so many other reviews pointed out. The customer service was good for my experience but I can tell it could easily slip as the communication between their staff was so-so. 

The food was average and they didn't really explain via their website, or up front when you get there that it's a fixed price menu on the weekend, it was only after I asked why is there not any prices next to the food. 

The price of the food was a bit steep for the quality of food and are probably just playing more for the "belly dancer" show, which I would admit was entertaining for sure, which last about 15mins.

So if you're thinking about this place its really just a one time place that you should check out but it won't leave a lasting memory that you can't stop talking about.
