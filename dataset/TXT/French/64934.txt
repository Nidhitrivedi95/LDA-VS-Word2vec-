TI8BCPSStuOgnqBHyTtG9Q Very nice hotel for a Sheraton. Service is very good here and the rooms are fantastic. A truly luxurious place - but also the prices.

I didn't like the lack of SPG recognition. Being a Platinum member, no word of it was mentioned during Check-in. No upgrade, no question whether breakfast or points. I did get Cub access, though. And the club is worth its name: They serve delicious afternoon snacks and drinks. Always a good spot to catch some interesting people.

Breakfast in the main restaurant was good but far from excellent. A standard selection of things that didn't change over the course of one week!

Food at the hotel restaurant was pretty standard, too. No surprises, and just what you would expect from "hotel food".
