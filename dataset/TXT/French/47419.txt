O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q I went to Morels for brunch on a Sunday and it was very good. I sat outside and had nice view of the strip. I ordered the waffle and bacon which were very good. I'm only giving 4 stars because the hostess was not very friendly and I received my food but no silverware or napkin. I took the napkin and silverware from the table behind me because my waiter took awhile to return. Other than that nice restaurant and I will defiantly return:)
