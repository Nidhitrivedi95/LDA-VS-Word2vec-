4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I remember liking this restaurant the first time I went there years ago. This time we went on a busy night but had reservations. We went right in. There were lots of people and I found service to be fast and good considering the amount of people there. My fiance's steak was Ok not good but not horribly bad. I would def. not order that again. My scallops were good-but would not really say it's worth the money. The french onion soup was very good. Overall they have a nice view, good service, overpriced (but expected on the strip), portion size is decent, but food is nothing special. I don't think I will be going back.
