SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ SO many reviews already I'll try to keep it short and Sweet!

Food~ I've only been for lunch, is Always Delicious, price, quality and quantity wise.
Some of my favorites include Quiche of the day served with salad and fresh fruit, The Grilled Salmon and the Chicken Shawarma Salad (see pics) 
The desserts Ive had are also mouthwatering, although they cost almost as much as any of the entrees I've named above. Angel food cake with berries and creme anglaise or the White Chocolate Banana Bread Pudding were both out of this world (see pics)

Service~ seems like a chore to the college pukes who work here, be lucky if you get served at all. 
Most recently I watched our waiter through the window completely ignore us the entire time while he drank wine and chatted with some slob at the bar. 
I have however been waited on properly, maybe suggesting a female server might help. Bad service has always come from the male staff.

Ambiance~ Love it, inside a cute old house or outside on the Lush and maturely landscaped garden patio.

*Notes*
~Make reservations for lunch or dinner just to be safe
~Bring at least $2 in coin for the parking meters
~Dinner prices are near triple the lunch prices for the entrees
~Ask for a bread and butter basket, chances are you'll be here awhile

**parking meters have an 80min. time limit, mention this if you are having SLOW service

I  have to give 5 stars for the food
