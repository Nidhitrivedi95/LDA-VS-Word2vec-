Yes, it's affordable for the Strip, but I wasn't blown away by any means.  We were upstairs at one of the private rooms, which did have a nice view of the casino floor.  

Service was just fair--they seemed bewildered when I didn't want the creme brulee and asked for a fruit cup instead.  What's the prob?
