Other reviewers are right, this place is LOUD.  The food was nicely presented and tasted good.   Although I wasn't a fan of the Salmon and lentils because the lentils had a very meaty taste that did not mesh well with the fish.  I had the unlimited rose wine for $20 - they aren't stingy and I left quite tipsy.
