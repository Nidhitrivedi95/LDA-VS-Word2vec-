STX8NfaW_xP6YZq-wERHYg We ended up here unexpectedly when there was a 2 hour wait for brunch at El Dorado... what a pleasant surprise. The place was pretty packed, so we had to sit three to a table for 2 and interfered with traffic. Other than that, I thought the place was great. We all really enjoyed our entrees. The coffee was excellent. The two individuals that I was with really enjoyed their champagne cocktails. The food seemed like good quality. The salad greens were really fresh and I could tell the gruyere cheese was high quality. The portions weren't huge, but I was happy that I didn't feel stuffed all day. I will be headed back soon! I was really surprised at how many French speaking customers were there too.
