gh6__q2WXFuyN8gt6VAnWw Living in Rhode Island and being surrounded by East Providence and Fall River establishments, this place in Vegas can definitely compete with the likes of Madeira, Sagres, O Dinis, etc..

The chourica bombeira was superb, hot, home made and just enough spice. The Bacalhau Assado was one of the best salted cod dishes ever. ...and lets not even bring up the 'agua dente'...it may have been Bulgarian, but it tastes just like the shut mybfather introduces to me in Hartford, CT at Cafe Ferro Velho back in the 80s.
