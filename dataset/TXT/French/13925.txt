50-xiTYmE6NERi-yJ6NvHw The oysters are disgusting... Don't go for cheap oysters.. They stink and smell like dead for years... We had to throw away at least 5 of them...
Didn't say anything until paying the bill cuz we didn't want the waiter to feel embarrassed; but after we brought it up in a friendly way, he didn't feel sorry at all and didn't even ask us why we said so, but just said they can't be any fresher for THREE times.
Btw no bread was served until we asked for the second time, and it was not even busy at all.
No comment. Will never come back again.
