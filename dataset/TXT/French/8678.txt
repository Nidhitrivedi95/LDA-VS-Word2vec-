4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Very good place to eat.  Food was terrific but a little spendy, but again it is Vegas right?  I ordered there special which was the sea bass.  It was cooked to perfection and the freshness and flavor was out of this world.  We also had the Baked Brie with honey and roasted pecans.  amazing!,,,  you have to try the mango sorbet'. Really really good :)
