eJ9L40jm5VOXCIq7xs9kQw This place is a gem, and even with a touch of attitude, I'm still giving this restaurant 5 stars, and here's why...

The food, ambiance, and service is stellar. I went with my family for a celebratory dinner when I was back home and I'm thinking about this meal months later. Two of us had the table d'hote, one a la carte, and my sister had the tasting menu (we all got to try her dishes to help her out). Every single dish was prepared as requested, seasoned well, and came at a leisurely, yet not too drawn-out pace. My parents had been here several times before but I had always declined because I assumed it would be stuffy, but the location in the Auberge means that the clientele is of all ages - some clearly younger than myself so I didn't feel out of place. If you love dessert soufflé you should make sure to get it here, it is divine, I only wished that I had ordered it myself and wasn't limited to tasting my dad's! He got the Grand Mariner one, but there is also one flavored with Calvados, or a chocolate chip one if you don't like the taste of alcohol.

I'm going to try very hard to visit again when I am back in town next.
