The service was good. We started off with the SEA SCALLOPS GRATINÉES which were awesome and then had the MUSSELS MARINIÈRE. The mussels were a great choice as well. Each dish had a lot of flavor which complemented the seafood of choice. For my main dish I couldn't decide on a steak but ended up with the STEAK AU POIVRE which was prepared perfectly. it was a nice large and flat piece which was so tender. I don't know how they did it but I get hungry thinking about it. Their frites were just as good. Mixed in with a couple glasses of champagne and wine and we had a perfect meal. The dessert was so so. We had the creme brulee but it was missing the vanilla bean flavor that I like in most creme brulee dishes. 
A must try place if you are in Vegas.
