rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A My friend and I went to Bouchon for Monday Morning Breakfast.  Our waiter was Matthew who was very nice.  In the beginning, he took the time to explain all of the french menu items.  Then his section began to get more and more full and we got less and less attention.  I hate that I had to flag him down to ask to add another dish and then once again for the check after we had been sitting with empty plates for quite some time. At such a distinguished place, he should have been checking on us a little more frequently.  

The Lyonaisse potatoes are a must have! So good.  They had carmelized onions which had a great flavor. I definitely recommend them.

My friend had the french toast which was made like bread pudding.  I tried it but was completely impressed (probably because I'm not a bread pudding fan).  He said it was delicious and the best thing he ordered.

I enjoyed my soy milk cappuccino.  It was made well.  My friend Kose said his cappuccino was just ok.  The cheese danish pastry was also just ok.

I'd like to try their dinner.  Breakfast was good but I wasn't majorly impressed.  The ambiance is nice though.
