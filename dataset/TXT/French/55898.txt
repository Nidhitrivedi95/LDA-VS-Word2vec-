rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I love this place. I rave about it to my friends and really anyone who will listen. I don't normally order chicken and waffles, but my waitress recommended it, so I gave it a try. Amazing. So full of life and flavor. They brine it for 18 hours and roast it. It is served with a Chaucer sauce (correct spelling?) which to me is basically the most tasty gravy I have ever had. The waffle is a sourdough (though not overly so) waffle with bacon and chives in it served with vanilla butter. Very light and fluffy. I enjoyed it so much I came back the next morning to have it. I tried to order it a third morning, but it was Monday and alas they only serve this piece of perfection on the weekend. The coffee is also a standout here. My wife said the pastry she order was really good as well. The service was on point every visit and the decor was tastefully done without being overbearing. Another plus, they kept space between tables so as not to leave you feeling bunched in. Not the case at a few other restaurants we tried. I pay to eat cattle, not be treated like 'em.
