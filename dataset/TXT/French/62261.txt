SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ It has been some time since my last visit to HoT.  I recall it being very good and I had even recommended it to others.  Not so much anymore.

The food quality was very average.  I had the foie gras starter.  This was so disappointing - it was not a nice piece of fg, it was drowning in an odd sauce and the bread was hard and just not good.  

For main course I tried the osso buco, while not bad it was definitely nothing to write home about.

The worst part for me was the service.  The server was unfriendly, cort and seemed to want to rush us away.  At one point I snapped at him because I had enough.  

I don't think I'll ever return now.  Kinda sad it was so bad.
