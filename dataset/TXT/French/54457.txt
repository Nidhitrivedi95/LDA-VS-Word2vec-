One of my biggest complaints is the prices for what you are getting. I mean I work in fine dining and totally understand having to charge top price for quality ingredients but this place seemed to have just randomly started assigning outrageous prices all over the menu. Not to mention I felt guilt tripped by the server for not wanting to order a bottle of wine, like I'm sorry I wasn't looking for wine tonight I'm just as pleased with my beer and my bfs cocktail stop asking me if I'm sure. And the sommelier was rude, if u are going to ask how a meal was at least pretend to even listen to the response before walking away. Now onto the food cuz as I said I work in the industry and respect quality food at a high price, but even there the food was lacking. We had the oysters, good standard oysters nothing too special. Then we had the escargot which I wanted to love, but honestly wrapping them in the pastry totally took away everything and that's all you could taste, very disappointed. I had the NY Strip which was fine, once again nothing special or stand out about it and mine seemed a little too fatty, a good 1/4 of my steak was all fat which I know creates flavor but when you are getting a 12 Oz steak and at least 3oz of it is straight fat it's disappointing. My bf had the lobster which was good except the fact the bernaisse sauce overwhelmed the dish so much he couldn't even enjoy it. Plus is side of polenta with mushrooms and peas was so under seasoned we each took 1 bite and pushed it to the side to never be touched again. Overall a disappointing experience, neither of us wish to return again and defn will not be recommending this place to anyone in the future. With so many great restaurants in Las Vegas this one defn should be skipped.
