DJcvnN7BCiqOUAra35xYuA Food was decent. I ordered a small bowl of shrimp pho and it was good, and the serving was more than enough (I took some to go!), but the limes were dry and so I asked for more and some of them were dry too...
I also order a Spider Spring Roll, that was pretty good, but a lot of lettuce and only like two pieces of shrimp... Might as well had ordered a lettuce wrap.
Total for two things and a fountain drink was about $23... Seems pretty pricey for it, but I guess it's okay.
The server was nice, but not once did she stop to ask how everything was, if I needed anything else... The servers were also being very loud, which wouldn't have been a problem, but when they're yelling at each other (and throwing around a few curse words here and there) across the restaurant, it's a bit obnoxious and uncalled for.

TL;DR: 
would come back for the pho, but the service makes me iffy on coming back.
