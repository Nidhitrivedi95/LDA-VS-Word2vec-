Sr-DO1Nt8X4I4Pjxapwz-g Beautiful setting on the patio. Service is a little slow. We like to be seated and then have something in front of us, be it water and menus or drinks. We ordered the soup of the day, tour de france with sides of sweet potatoe tots and house made chips. Waited quite a while then everything came at once. Beautifully presented.Would have liked the soup first.  Bean soup was a little thin, sandwiches were great and sides were ho hum. Dessert platter was overly sweet - sickly sweet. Iced teas were also very sweet. Portion sizes are a little on the small size but prices were very reasonable. Wait staff was friendly. I'm not sure we would go back but will recommend it
