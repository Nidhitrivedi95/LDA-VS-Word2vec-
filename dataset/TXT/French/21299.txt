B56AYe5GNuavMDtwFsXqzA I went for brunch over Labor Day weekend. I had always been a fan of Tapino - but more for the patio than the food honestly. Wow was I surprised at the level of flavor and quality of ingredients at Chef James' newest endeavor. First of all, the atmosphere is unexpected for a Scottsdale restaurant. Small, cozy, earthy but sophisticated. I had the quiche and the flavor was something to savor. Just the right size portion at a great price. We also had the homemade donuts with Nutella - eat them while they are hot! The homemade sausage and sauces were truly decadent and delicious. My only negative comment.....we were the only diners at the time and Chef James was sitting at the bar but never came over to welcome us.... I don't hold it against the restaurant but it certainly would have made the experience that much better had he made that personal connection with his guests. Will be back to try dinner soon.
