jLxeBgWhLRbII2ACkgH1Sg In a word, amazing. I enjoyed the Croque Madame and chocolate almond croissant. So much food -- if you're a light eater or not terribly hungry, split something! My friend had the crepe with goat cheese, chicken, onion and spinach. Both dishes were excellent. Highly recommend!
