Beautiful view of the Vegas skyline, has a outdoor seating area, amazing decor,a club, great service, drinks were pretty strong, great fresh food, dessert was amazing (chocolate  souffle ).

Pretty pricey is the only con, but you gota live it up in vegas and I'm glad I had a great dinner here
So far the best experience dining on the strip
