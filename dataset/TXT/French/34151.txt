hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA Great spot for a slice of Paris. Staff was so nice and friendly, very accommodating and downright inviting, as if I was a guest in someone's home. This is how all cafes should be. 
Had the quiche Lorraine, quiche Curry chicken, chicken pesto panini, tomato Beet bisque. Everything was delicious and served promptly and at the right temp. The coffee was wonderful and the watermelon lemonade was very refreshing. I so wish that the clam chowder wasn't sold out when I visited. Will definitely be back the next time I'm in LV.
