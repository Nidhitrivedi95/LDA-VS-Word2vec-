Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA This is an upscale french restaurant at the top floor of Mandalay Bay's "The Hotel". We had attentive servers who were eager to please. 

The potato gnocchi with mushrooms had a tasty, earthy, smokey flavor to it. It was a very unique dish. I had the scallops topped with american caviar for the entree. I'd say scallops taste like scallops, but the caviar added a hint, aroma and taste of the sea. The ribeye was well-prepared -- it was cooked even all throughout with the done-ness done accurately. It had a good sear and crusty char on the exterior which I like. It was tender like prime steak should be.

For dessert: nothing unique. ice cream, profiteroles, with options for different types of sauce topped things off nicely.
