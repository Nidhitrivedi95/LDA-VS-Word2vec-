htQgj-ANQpZGpIpkkrEmyQ I came here for an anniversary dinner with my husband and enjoyed the food. I highly recommend the INSP burger because it is one of the most creative, delicious burgers I've ever had. The servers were excellent and were very friendly. This place is a bit small but very unique and artistic, with different walls of artwork and relaxing music. 
The INSP burger had pork belly, taro chips, egg and a huge piece of meat that I must say is better than Burger's Priest. You could order duck confit fries which has a delicious mayo with it as well. The fries are the stringy kind that I love and the portions are very generous. The fries were a bit dry when I went though this time around.
The Udon Carbonara was freshly made, the sauce was very delicious and I liked the texture of the udon. It was very filling and tasty, but I think that the burger is the best thing offered at this restaurant. The price is also very reasonable for a high quality fusion restaurant in Markham.
