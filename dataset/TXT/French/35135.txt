HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw Brought two friends to Comme Ca yesterday and we had the five (5) course pre-fix bistronomy menu based on the recommendation of our server - Rebecca.

1st course was a really nice lobster bisque (the seasoned pumpkin seeds made this dish)
2nd was an extremely flavorful venison carpaccio (really enjoyed this dish, I am not a venison fan usually) 
3rd was an amazing bacon wrapped swordfish (hands-down the best dish I have had in months - highlight of the meal for me) 
4th was the "baby pig" (good pork belly but it wasn't overwhelmingly creative)
The desert was chocolate beignets (nice rich chocolate flavor without being over powering).

Overall a fantastic meal and dining experience!  The staff (managers and servers) were very helpful and attentive as they explained the items, the flavors, and wine pairing options.
