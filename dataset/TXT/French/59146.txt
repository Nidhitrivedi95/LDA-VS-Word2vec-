rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w Ate there last night.  Staff was clearly unhappy and that set a poor tone. Kinda snooty.  Good was very good with the notable exception of the Wagyu steak.  I was very disappointed in the quality. No where near the quality and taste I've had in other restaurants.  Definitely not worth the extra $175.
