SCklYa_jhihWAcfIn-_chg I grew up in France so I understand the value of a good croissant. That being said the lineups here are absolutely mind-boggling on the weekend. Best to just head through the front door and grab some baked goods from the counter. Food is nice, but nowhere near worth the fuss.
