xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g What a wonderful experience!!!
My bf and I came for dinner to celebrate my birthday early. Mon Ami Gabi is my favorite restaurant in Vegas but I might have to change my mind! The Eiffel Tower was incredible. We didn't have a reservation but had no problem getting a table. It was so nice to find a place that actually sticks to it's dress code. I hate being the only patrons dressed appropriately in an upscale restaurant. We were seated close to the window so we could see the fountains. It's actually pretty brilliant the way the dining room is laid out so everyone can get some sort of view. 
Anyway, we started with the sea scallops which were divine! Cooked to perfection, melted in your mouth- but you are only paying for 2 so be aware. 
Our server made great recommendations. My bf had the halibut and could not stop raving about the flavor! I had the red snapper and it was brilliant! I wanted to order more! Unfortunately the portions are a bit small for my taste but that was to be expected.
And now comes the best part of the meal....They have like 5 or 6 types of souffle! We opted for the pistachio souffle and I kid you not, IT WAS THE BEST THING I HAVE EVER PUT IN MY MOUTH!

Yes, this place is pricey but worth every penny! The service was great, the food was wonderful and the view unmatched. I recommend going around sunset and watch the strip come to life!
