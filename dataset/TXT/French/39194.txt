JsAjP49bCk9KjJmmmjyM4w I've been "hearing" ( reading on yelp) so much about this place and its delicious croissants that I just had to have one and see if they really were worth all the hype. 

We came here on a beautiful morning, and it was still early enough that when we arrived there was still a good amount of croissants and pain au chocolat left. 

In addition to the croissants and Clafouti they also have croissant sandwiches (chicken Dijon, turkey and brie, tomato,basil and cheese, etc...), and croissants with cinnamon and brown sugar, fig, peanut butter and chocolate, almond, almond and chocolate,and a few more that I cannot recall at this moment. What I do remember however is that everything in here looked absolutely delicious. 

We decided to get a couple of the butter croissants, a cinnamon and brown sugar croissant and a pain au chocolat, as well as a couple of lattes. We took our purchase to Trinity Bellwoods sat down on a bench and indulged. 

The butter croissants had a nice shell to them, and a buttery but maybe too chewy inside. They were very good, but I would have liked them to be more flaky and less chewy. The pain au chocolat was meh. I didn't particularly enjoy it, however the cinnamon and brown sugar croissant was absolutely, frigging delicious! I loved it! It was worth every single one of the billion hip creeping calories I'm sure it had. The coffee was good, but not particularly so. All in all, I was satisfied with the croissants and can't wait to try the almond or fig ones. 

We were later meeting up with my bf's mom for lunch at her place so we decided to take her a croissant so she could try it. She said it was a bit soggy, and from looking at it, I could tell she was right. I guess these are better eaten fresh and don't do well when taken for a walk in the park before consuming. I'll remember that next time I buy some to take home. :)
