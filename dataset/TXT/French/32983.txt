h5nqSouJ2cIVXDIIs_V5Pw We went there based on Yelp's reviews because we were staying across the road at a beautiful luxury holiday apartment. 

The food was good, not cheap but ridiculously small portions. Like they served at the height of the silly nouvelle cuisine movement in the early 90's.

I had a good hamburger down the road at Wannaburgers afterwards and I am not a big eater. 

We were served good sized portions at all the other Edinburgh restaurants we went to, while staying there.
