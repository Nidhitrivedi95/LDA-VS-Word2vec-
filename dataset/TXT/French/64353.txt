tCSlpwJQ4CZsUEMZeH2SFg Food is ok. I had risotto and that's hard to pull off. The flavors were off and it was bland. I feel like the food is well cooked but not flavorful everytime Ive been there. The deserts are perfect so just for coffee and tea it's fine. I felt like I was under dressed and I was wearing a skirt and cardigan...it was lots of stuffy old ladies who lunch and I defintely felt a little up turned nose my way by the wait staff. The menu is puzzling because of all the Italian food on a French menu. Wtf? I did enjoy it for my couponed price and might be back for carrot cake but maybe to go.
