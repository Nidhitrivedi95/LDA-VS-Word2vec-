s11Ym0QX2Am2uwtnyou4GA I went back for brunch! Great spot and nice to not have to worry about lines. The space was also nice because one of my DC's was bringing along a 2 year old and they were very accommodating. They have highchairs and our server brought paper for the kid to draw on. 
They have lots of specials, but we had to try the brunch platter for 2. For $45 you get poached eggs, pork belly, chorizo, crayfish (!), rosti potatoes, a tossed kale salad, AND 2 mimosas. A very filling and tasty brunch and a nice change from your usual brunch offerings. We also sampled their omelette special - chorizo, kale, and cheese which was delicious and came with roasted potatoes. Another DC had the salmon eggs benny. The yolk was nice and runny as it should be. 
The chef himself came out and went around to tables to see how we liked the food, which was a nice, personal touch. 
I'm adding this to my rotation of 1) special treat brunch spots and 2) places to take out of town guests/bigger groups (one of the few places to take brunch reservations, but if you arrive before noon you shouldn't need one).
