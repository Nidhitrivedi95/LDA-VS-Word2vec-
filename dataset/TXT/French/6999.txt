4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Not a bad choice I made for dinner, if I do say so myself.  Directly across from the fountains at the Bellagio,  inside the Paris casino, it's about as European as you can get in Vegas.  It's dark, romantic, and seductive, the waitstaff (or at least our waiter) has excellent manners, and the busboys refill your water regularly, and the prices are very reasonable for the level of service and quality.  An excellent, well-organized, French-style restaurant.  They made a little boo-boo on my girlfriend's order, but from my standpoint it was just about perfect.  Oh, and Betty H. just reminded me of how they put a mini baguette right on the table in the bag - a classy touch, and fresh, tasty bread to boot, with your choice of whipped butter or whipped carrots.  I chose . . . both.

You might think that a vegetarian foodie (some of you don't understand that there is such a thing, but I'll let you catch up) wouldn't be able to find anything at a French restaurant, but au contraire, mon frere - they have a vegetarian sampler that is anything but an afterthought.  Garlic spinach, some spicy lentils, asparagus, potatoes au gratin, green beans, and whipped cauliflower . . . it's like someone made your vitamins delicious . . . and I thoroughly enjoyed every bite, and my beat-down-by-Vegas body was reinvigorated.  The wine selection is good, but I opted for the brewed-in-Quebec triple Belgian beer, the Fin du Monde, and like Frank the Tank would say, "It feels so good when it hits your lips . . . so good!"

One word of caution, though - the bathroom is out the door inside the casino and around the corner, so depending on where you're sitting, it might be a hike . . . and the water and the wine keep coming . . .
