YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g My husband and I went to Fleur a few months ago.  As a result, I cannot remember all that we ordered but I mention the highlights below.  I have wanted to go to his restaurant in SF but not ready to commit to the price point yet. I thought, why go to SF when I can get a restaurant.com gc for his Vegas place?

First off, our server was amazing! He didn't give us any crap for having a restaurant.com which some nicer places tend to do.  Second, he was funny and checked in the right amount of time.  Food had good timing- we were able to enjoy a couple plates at a time with the next sets coming out right when we were ready for them.  Also, dished had great presentation. Some come out on dry ice which is always fun.

The food- we had the fleur burger 5000... Yeah right! While it would be funny to use a coupon for that, there is no way I would order it!  

Croque Monsieur- thought it was going to be croquettes (that's our fault).  It was okay but not what we expected.  The waiter asked if we liked it and we told him it was not what we thought it would be. He took it away and took it off the bill.  We replaced with the chicken croquettes which is what we originally thought we were getting.  They lacked a little bit of flavor- guess I just like the ones I make at home a little bit better.

Risotto- freaking awesome.  I love Parmesan in my risotto and this did not disappoint.  Very strong, bold favors.

Tuna tacos- these were pretty good.   Not disappointing, but nothing extra special about them.

Ceviche- really enjoyed this one.  It was nice and light and had great flavor.

Chocolate souffle- yummmmmmmmmy!

Overall, we really enjoyed the overall dining experience and ambiance.  The price point might be a little high without the restaurant.com, but it is typical Vegas prices.  Stop by the happy hour if you can and catch a good drink special!
