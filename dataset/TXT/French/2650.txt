0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g Just went on Monday for a fantastic dinner. We had the Vegetarian Menu which was absolutely amazing. First the chef sent out an apple and crispy potato amuse bouche. First course was a creamy but light ajo blanco, followed by a second course of a stuffed eggplant. Third course was amazing sautéed asparagus with mushrooms (my favorite out of all the courses) and the fourth course was a vegetable ragout on a cauliflower puree I believe. For desert I opted for the poached pear on an almond frangipane, while my boyfriend had the tres leches. Oh, and they bring out a wonderful little assortment of sweet bites (ours was a pomegranate truffle, a mint meringue, a berry pate de fruit, a lemon bar and a strawberry chocolate tart)  Even though it's not listed I recommend asking for a custom wine pairing to go with the vegetarian meal - they have an impressive wine list and this way you get to try a bit of everything.
