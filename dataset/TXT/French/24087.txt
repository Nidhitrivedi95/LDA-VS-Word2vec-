cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed Au Pied du Cochon. I'd even go as far as recommending it to anyone visiting Montreal. I don't regret eating there - but I wouldn't be upset if I never ate there again.

Au Pied du Cochon is a culinary experience unlike any I've ever had. I'm not sure it's counterpart exists in the US. It's pure gluttony. The menu doesn't have much finesse - it punches you in the face with flavor and foie. I enjoyed every dish we had, but wouldn't rave about any of them. The duck in a can was good, the duck carpaccio was better, the tuna belly was tasty, but none of it blew me away. Most tasted good for a bite or two, and then wore me down with its richness. Especially the beef osso buco, which was the thickest osso buco I've ever tasted. 

I enjoyed eating at APdC. It's an experience worth having while in Montreal. The service and ambiance are awesome. But would I put in the same sentence as Joe Beef? No, definitely not. You want to eat at Joe Beef every weekend - you want to eat at APdC once, and then go hibernate for a year.
