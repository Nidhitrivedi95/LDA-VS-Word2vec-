For someone who loves burgers and fries, I can't believe it took me 8 years to try Patati Patata. In my defence, Pitarifique is right across the street. But needless to say, I'm now hooked. 

Breakfast, lunch or dinner, you can't go wrong with this spot. It's a bit cozy, and you may wait for a table, but it's totally worth it.
