OYHpqY6-3C-wXR-uPbHhwA I love supporting local businesses....in fact, I make a point to spend my money at local places.  So, when I saw this new cafe coming on my side of town, I was thrilled!  I was very hopeful it would live up to its great name!  It turns out it was a 3-star experience.

We stopped in on a Saturday morning early. The location is conveniently located in a strip mall right off 215.  It has several outside tables, which is perfect for dining outside when the weather is nice.

The inside of the cafe is quaintly decorated with warm inviting colors.  Their set-up is a little awkward because their display cases are so large it doesn't leave much room for ordering, using the condiment station or making your way back to the restrooms.  I can't imagine how hard it will be to move around once it starts getting crowded.

Here are the pros:  friendly wait staff, ease in ordering, interesting menu, good coffee and comfy seating.

Here are the cons:  long wait to get your food, inconvenience of getting your coffee condiments if you seat outside, and average food.

I thought their prices were a little high for the quality/quantity you receive.  Their brisket wasn't very flavorful and had large pieces of grissel.  The veggie quiche was flavorful though...but pricey at $7.95 with no sides.

Their desserts looked good, so we might be back to give those a try.  They offered an assortment of gelato, macaroons and cakes.
