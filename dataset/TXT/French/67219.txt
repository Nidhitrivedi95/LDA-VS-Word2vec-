USleI8g1UVN9-9jm-b4uIg A cheese plate featuring 100% water buffalo cheese, elk chops, and the cayenne pepper triple chocolate cheese made for one of the best and most unique Charlotte meals I have ever had. My only criticism, however minor, is the music: "It's Beginning to Look a lot like Christmas" and "Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer" played on a loop can get absolutely maddening through the course of a one hour dinner service. That should not deter you though as The Fig Tree is now in my Charlotte Top 3.
