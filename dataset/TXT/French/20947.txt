AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw This review is for the sit down part of the restaurant (not the express to go area). We wanted to eat some place different for breakfast, the food here is good ( we didn't eat from breakfast buffet), I had a classic croque, which this toasted bread that had this buttery flakiness like a crossiant, ham/cheese that came with a side salad.
It is pricey here, since for a glass of OJ (happens to be fresh squeezed) is $6. The service was prompt, friendly, it was neat to watch the chefs cooking since there kitchen is in a circular shape.
