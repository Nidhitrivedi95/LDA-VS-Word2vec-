Dcj69NZJnbJhK-YHP_nULA The beer selection is wonderful. The food....   truffle fries were the best I've ever had. The summer v burger was small and not worth $12. I want to mention that the two other people we ate with were happy with what they ordered and didn't share in my bummed attitude. In my personal opinion, this place is great for drinks or starters. If you are HUNGRY.... Don't go here.
