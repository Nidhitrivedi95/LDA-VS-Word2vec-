nkHaix6KenApS8M-liZsCQ Had another perfect celebratory meal at Christopher's. Our waiter, Phillip, was friendly, knowledgeable about the menu, and his service was exemplary. From the foie gras and mushroom soup and foie gras petit plate, to the deconstructed lobster pot pie and the veal sweetbreads, the entire experience was everything we have come to expect from this fine restaurant. Dessert of Gateau Marjolaine and Christopher's unique cheesecake, along with a good stiff espresso were our conclusions, and after bidding au revoir to Chef Christopher Gross and his marvelous staff, we left a very, very happy couple. More celebrations to come at Christopher's and Crush. Best French food in the Valley.
