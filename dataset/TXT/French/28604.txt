We did the 7 course tasting menu which was delicious and for only $68 a person total. Maybe I'm used to NYC prices too much, but it seemed entirely reasonable for a romantic French restaurant's nicest possible option. I had the escargot (yes, snails --- but yes, delicious!) filet migon, and they brought a mini array of desserts. Also, we had our hotel make our reservations, and told them about the birthday. They reserved the nicest table on a raised platform over a window, secluded from the restaurant with a nice view of the little street in Old Montreal. Perfect evening, delicious food, excellent service.
