A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g If you happen to stop by Vegas or you're just in the mood for a little pastry to...THIS IS THE PLACE. It's originality and taste will definitely keep you coming back for more. The best thing I like about this place is that it's simple. All the pastries are made and you are able to see how they make them too! That's my favorite part. Anyways, if you haven't gone yet, GO. You won't regret it.
