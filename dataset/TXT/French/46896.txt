nm4abb_14L3y0TBizNgq7A First off, I must say the atmosphere was so delightful.  Warm, cozy, intimate.  Would make a perfect date night place.  We got to choose our table.  Very friendly staff.  They actually spoke just French but had a waitress with some English.  We managed to figure it out together along with bing translator.  We started off with the mussels with smoked salmon.  The broth was heavenly.  So lite and delicate.  The full size was huge.  The 3 of us split it.  I had the duck burger over salad.  It was served well fine which was disappointing since I Love my Burger and duck more rare.  It was also dry.  My daughter got the Mexican burger with salsa and guacamole.  She said it was ok.  My husband got the stuffed salmon  over rice. A little on the small size, but it was moist and good.  It lost points for the over cooked duck burger but the service made the night.
