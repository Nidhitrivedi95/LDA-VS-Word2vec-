SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ This little gem off of Mill Avenue in Tempe is such a delight. The two houses merge together with a lovely tree-shaded patio. It's perfect for groups or couples. Our party of three sat outside watching the revelers attend the ASU/Stanford game as there was a private party going on inside the houses. No matter, the weather was perfect and the heaters were warm enough. Our service was fair, to be honest and I would have preferred a little more attention and information regarding the menu. The food was amazing though. The filet actually melted in our mouths and was perfectly seasoned. It sat atop a delicious mixture of cheddar grits and veggies. The halibut was also nicely done and very flavorful. The best part of this meal was the amazing bread pudding dessert. You cannot skip this one filled with apples and the flavors of fall. The red velvet chocolate mousse cake was also good, but the bread pudding was better. Very nice wine list accompanies and the cocktails are quite good - try the salted old fashioned for a unique twist on the old favorite.
