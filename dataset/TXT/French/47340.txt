O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q Went twice for lunch on my recent trip to Vegas. Both times were very, very good. Prices were a little on the high side for lunch but combined with the pretty dining room and great service was well worth it. Will probably be back the next time we are in town. I especially liked the table side Bloody Mary preparation.
