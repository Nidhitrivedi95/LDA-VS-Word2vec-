8ciT6qjI18x9EPtOb-gqYQ I had been wanting to try Coup des Tartes for a long time and was VERY disappointed! 

First, kudos to management for their flexibility in allowing me to make a reservation for a date past the expiration date of my Groupon--much appreciated! Service was very good. 

FOOD: Bread was plentiful and good. The appetizers were WONDERFUL--the brie was very good (love the candied apple) and the onion tart (while a bit small in portion size) was over the top delicious! The entrees, however, were fair. 

My husband ordered pork tenderloin which wasn't particularly tender and was bland in flavor. I ordered the much ballyhooed lamb shank and found it to be lackluster--the sauce was good, but the lamb was just OK and overall it lacked flavor. I've had much better lamb elsewhere.

I was VERY surprised, given the many raves here on Yelp! The entrees were especially disappointing given they were rather expensive. Lots of other restaurants at this price point and below with much better food than we experienced.  Unfortunately, I didn't have time to try dessert. But I won't be going back. :(
