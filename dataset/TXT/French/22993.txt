bzbNGyrTwWHAgg1CqkSgeg I am incredibly disappointed to give such a poor review. I was so excited to try this place, especially the crab cake blt. I do have to note that the flavors of the dish were fine, not wonderful, but good enough to pay for. However my mother found two short black hairs on her plate. Neither of us have short black hair. The inexcusable part was the manner in which it was handled. The server was rude and unapologetic. And shockingly only half of the cost of the meal was removed from the bill. It is pretty standard in my opinion that when a dish is deemed inedible due to sanitation issues, it should be completely taken off.
