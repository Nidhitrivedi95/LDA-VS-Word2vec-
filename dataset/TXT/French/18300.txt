A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g Best french bread in all of Vegas. Desserts are so reasonably priced.  Bakeries in Chicago cost 2-4 times more and their product stands up to the best.  Great place to grab a sandwich and some desserts.  Dine in, take out, or pack away for a picnic at super summer theater.  Just take note of their hours sometime they are closed when they go on a well deserved vacation.  So happy this place is a part of Summerlin.  If you have never been you are truly missing out.
