-4TMQnQJW1yd6NqGRDvAeA First time diner with the best experience. I was visiting friends in Paradise Valley and the last day we were there we came here for brunch. The outdoor ambiance was posh but still very cozy. I was blown away by the food and bottomless mimosas ; our server made them just the way I like them...lots of champagne and a splash of Orange juice. However, the thing that stood out the most to me was in the beginning when my friend finally joined us and she sat down at the table, placing her purse on the ground next to her and the server came by, with out even asking, and placed a napkin out to set her purse on top of it.

Love this place.
