Long review: I'm very happy Vi Pei Bistro opened in Stouffville. This restaurant fills the gap for a family-friendly restaurant with a menu that will please many palates and prices that won't break your wallet. 

Came here for brunch, lunch and dinner; each time was a good experience. Service is fast and friendly. 

Their kids' menu is great. Healthy options such as pasta and salmon along with the usual breaded chicken strips. The portions are big too. 

Desserts are made in-house. Tried the rolled crepe, it was delicious! The caramel sauce was sweet (as a caramel sauce should be) and fragrant.
