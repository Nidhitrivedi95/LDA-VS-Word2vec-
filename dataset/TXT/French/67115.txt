USleI8g1UVN9-9jm-b4uIg Dined here for my lady's birthday in late February and enjoyed everything from start to finish. The food was outstanding and the service was great. We have driven by here so many times and always planned to dine here, I'm glad that we finally did. I had the stuffed calamari and the amazing elk chop, the birthday girl had the beet carpaccio and the scallops and enjoyed both. Can't wait to go back
