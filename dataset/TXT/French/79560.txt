zqNgwQjj0_XAll-neGikIw I have a silly little obsession with French cafés and this is the closest you are going to get to a truly French café in South Scottsdale. First and most importantly, the croissants are fantastic. Be sure to go in the morning because they do sell out sometimes. The coffee is strong and not-at-all bitter and it great hot or iced. My children love the macarons and we get a pack each time we eat there. 

So far The kids and I have had the omelettes, the waffles and the crepes. I think next time I will have a croque monsieur. It all is amazing!

The decor has a rustic/industrial feel and is absolutely photogenic and fun!
