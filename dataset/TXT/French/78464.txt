yXXsAwDHAh86RYwvLsSaZw Stopped by for lunch while at a client site nearby and took their Grilled Sesame Beef.

What I got was I paid for. A few 'slices' of Beef with some sesame seeds and a few side orders. All in all the food was plain and uninspiring.

I'd recommend going for their special signature meals rather than their extended menu. I know I regretted it.
