Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA GREAT SERVICE! Spectacular VIEW! Good food!
Had the ribeye, lobster au curry, mac n cheese,  too bad no room for dessert. 
Ribeye(med-rare)- perfectly pan seared
Lobster au curry- party in my mouth, DELICIOUS.
Mac n' Cheese- way too cheesy! Consisitancy made it seem like they melted some cheese in heavy whipping cream, but went cheap on the quality ofcheese, the bits of ham were just weird.
drinks- green tea, surpisingly served at the right temperature and LOOSE leaf, no tea bags here, wait staff even told me to wait a few minutes for it to properly steep (brownie points), & Seirra Nevada, nice pairing with  steak for non vinophiles.
2nd visit Still 5 stars. This time it was a toss up between lamb and braised wagyu. I got the wagyu on waiters suggestion, it tasted like pot roast, oh well. Steak was again perfect. I finally got to try the lemon verbana tea, excellent. The mix candy bar itself tasted like a freshly made kit kat, mixed with the lime sorbet, it becomes that perfect NYE kiss. Service was on point.
