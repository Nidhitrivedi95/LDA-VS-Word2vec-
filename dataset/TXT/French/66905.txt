VIBE 
The renovation of Frankly Eatery into Glas was a great idea and I think the space works way better as a wine bar. It's a small intimate space with the kitchen right next to the dining area. It's a great spot for a date and to come with girlfriends. 

Chef Danny really welcomes you in as if you were walking into his home. He speaks with everyone and is just a really generous guy. 

THE GOODS 
I like that the plates are small so you can share them. If you're looking for appetizers, I really liked the soup (I think it changes regularly) and the crostini with cheese and tomato drizzled with olive oil. It was very fresh! 

The mains are also small. I had the Nova Scotian Sea Bream and it was the perfect mix of saltiness and crunchy texture. There was an almond sauce that accompanied the dish and the sweetness worked with the saltiness of the taste. 

The wine selection is small for a wine bar but I like that it's not an overwhelming list. I also like the options of Canadian selections. I had the Riesling but with the sea bream, I'd pick the Pino Grigio next time. 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
Usually, I'd be sarcastic over the mis-spelling of the word "glass." But if Danny named the bar, "glass" it would sound aggressive right? That said, the food, wine and atmosphere is worth the missing "s'! 
Nice addition to Leslieville and I hope it lasts longer than Frankly Eatery!
