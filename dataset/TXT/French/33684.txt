It's in a business complex away from the strip but we make our way here at least once (sometimes 2-3 times) per trip.  Everything is made in house.  The croissants are buttery delicious, the different tortes are delectable, and the sandwiches hit the spot without being heavy in the stomach.  The drinks are great as well.  We really haven't had a bad thing yet.  Add the consistent great service and friendly personality of Olivier, his mom, and the rest of the staff and your day is made.  Today I came in for their bread pudding and it's become my new obsession.  It's a must try.
