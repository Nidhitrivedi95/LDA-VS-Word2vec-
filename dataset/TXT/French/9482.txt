It was stupid because he told us what he wanted to order too! I don't really understand why we couldn't be seated? Anyways, he made it so we got seated outside.

I would definitely recommend getting seated outside. It was super nice and relaxing rather than the really fancy place inside... My friend and I split the sea bass, which was a special and it was okay. I wouldn't recommend it and it was over $30.

I DEFINITELY would recommend the french onion soup. That is why I am giving this place a 3 star WITH the view from outdoors and the ability to people watch (I mean it is Vegas after all....)
