jaSowNITPRRCYpPb3_pjdA We were big fans of Andre Rochat's namesake restaurant at the Monte Carlo, so it was bittersweet when we heard of its closing. But the opening of Andre's Bistro & Bar in the far southwest corner of the valley is much more than a consolation prize - it's pure Parisian bistro fare in a contemporary setting, with neighborhood prices. It blew our minds how inexpensive the entire brunch menu was, with nearly everything under $20 and most entrees in the $10-12 range.

We started with an order of three beignets, served hot and pillowy with a dusting of powdered sugar. With a crusty exterior and an almost crueller-like interior, they were a perfect way to start the meal.

We then moved on to the pastry basket, which included a croissant, chocolate croissant, almond danish, raspberry (?) danish, and something called "Mr. Sunny Side," which was a pastry with custard and apricots arranged to look like an egg.

Choosing a main was a difficult decision (thankfully the prices and location mean we'll be back early and often!) but I went with the smoked sausage, gruyère, and caramelized onion omelet, and it was perfect, all of the elements complimenting one another in one big eggy umami bomb. I did swap out my breakfast potatoes for frites (I mean, it's a bistro) and they were exactly what I was hoping for, crisp and flavorful.

Other entrées ordered at the table included a sausage platter, served with a warm potato salad, and a smoked salmon benedict. I didn't try either of them but my dining companions looked pleased with their orders.

Amid a flurry of great new restaurant openings in the Southwest, Andre's Bistro and Bar is poised to become a neighborhood institution.
