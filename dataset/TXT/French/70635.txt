xaqW4NkmUCGRRjmLxiFJ6Q I had never reviewed a single restaraunt before entering muncheez deli creperie restaraunt, because non left such a strong impression on me. I had ordered the Philly cheese steak and it was one of the greatest things I had ever tasted. Typically, I would never expect to experience such an extraordinary service and taste from a restaraunt that is this affordable, how wrong was I. If you're ever in the area, make sure to pay this place a visit and your respect, because you will possibly never experience such an amazing service and food from such a talented staff and at such a low cost ever again.
