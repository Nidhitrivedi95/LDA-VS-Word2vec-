4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw We found this restaurant through yelp and were able to make a reservation that same day.  Although the restaurant was very busy when we arrived, we were seated immediately. The atmosphere is amazing, mood lighting, but not so much private (we were in between two tables) One side is a booth, and the other side is chairs so there is a long booth with tables split with a space wide enough to allow you to sit down on the booth.  Although there is some indication that this restaurant is not kid friendly, it completely is.  They have a kids menu and crayons, which was enough to keep our kids entertained.  My son loved the pizza!  We also had a very patient waitress. In addition, I have a gluten allergy and they provide amazing gluten free bread before dinner and are very careful with the allergy. A little pricey, but you get what you pay for! I highly recommend.
