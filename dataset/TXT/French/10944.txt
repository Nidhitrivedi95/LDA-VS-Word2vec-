4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Taking price into consideration, the food here is nothing exceptional...greasy French bistro stuff. But the view from the patio is exceptional for people-watching! It faces right out onto the Vegas Strip, so you'll get an eyeful of the wacky passers-by and street freaks, with the occasional spouting of the Bellagio fountains across the street to liven things up.

If there are no seats available on the patio, however...no dice. The food isn't worth coming here without the view.
