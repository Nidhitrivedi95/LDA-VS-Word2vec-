rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A We came here for brunch one morning after staying up all night for a friend's bachelor party. Brunch was really good. We had a bunch of the pastries to start out. I ordered the Chicken and Waffles and it was fantastic. Going to hit this place next time I'm in town for dinner for sure.
