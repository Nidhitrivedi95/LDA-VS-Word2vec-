Yp9w4nhUowBU_IS_StFXbQ Went there on 12/22 for lunch on the recommendation of a friend.  It has a cheerful but relaxing atmosphere with plenty of light even though it was overcast and raining some.  While it has a dressier atmosphere, it didn't require you to dress up necessarily, just wear some non-raggedy half decent clothes.  It's located in the hotel area after you walk through the entire casino if you park in self parking.

The hostess and server were pleasant so it set up for a relaxed lunch.

I got the:
- Pan seared fish (for the life of me I can't remember the name of the fish, but it was a smaller white fish)

while others got:
- Napoleon of savory tofu, dressed with a mirepoix-like spicy ratatouille and fried eggplant
- Kobe burger
- Roasted chicken

The fish was well prepared with the outside a light crispness and the fish moist and soft.  Not overly sauced or seasoned.  The fish flavor was the main event just how I like it.

I was also able to taste the vegan Napolean which had a light but nice flavor with the combination of the tofu and more flavorful eggplant. Although I'm no vegetarian by any means, I love eggplant and better quality tofu so this may be an entree I choose next time if I'm feeling like something light and healthy.  The server told us this was what Steve Wynn gets every time he comes.

The Kobe burger was just another disappointing Kobe burger.  I have never liked any of the Kobe burgers I've ever had as they are more expensive and very average tasting.  American Kobe beef just isn't that good.  I've had a 100x better burger for $4 in Carbondale, CO at Fatbelly Burger where they serve natural grass fed beef burgers and of course in Japan where some places actually use real wagyu (Japanese beef).  That'll run you about the same price or more though as an American Kobe burger.

This is a place where you can kind of escape the lights and noises of Vegas to have a pleasant meal in a pleasant atmosphere.  I'll keep this one in my pocket as an option for lunch and maybe breakfast/brunch as that looks good too.

4 stars all around for ambience, service and food.
