uP3H5bcsiTXM0k0xQhRndg Wow!  Worth what ever time you have to wait in line outside - no reservations taken.  The fresh and ample salad complemented possibly one of the best meals that I have anywhere, any place, any time, period.  Yes the Mac and cheese is crazy good.   This is not really Mac and cheese.  It is fresh pasta, in a complex creamy cheese sauce with layers of flavor, and smoked ham that pushes it over the top.  That was not even the best dish, we had tonight.  The pork belly, and accompanying sauces was simply mind blowing.  Not only was this meal an outstanding value, I would challenge you to find something better anywhere in this city.  The atmosphere is very casual, the service was also great, and the food is prepared with passion.  Definitely a must stop!
