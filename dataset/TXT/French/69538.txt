WOd8tWsh2Yt_osHv-ngx_w Went at about noon on a weekday, with a baby and a stroller, and they were very accommodating and welcoming.  They even gave me a 4-person table so that I'd have lots of room, even though I was the only paying customer at the table, and the restaurant was full and busy.

The staff were friendly.  My fruit crepe with custard hit the spot.  

My only pet peeve: I ordered a tea, and they brought me a cup of hot water, with a tea bag on the side.  Restaurants need to know: the tea just doesn't brew when you have to put the bag in the tea.  It is a way better cup of tea if you pour the water on the bag.  So either bring it pre-poured, or bring the water in a little teapot, so that it can be poured over the bag into the mug.
