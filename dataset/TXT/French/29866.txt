FJMMPL3pxAPYGEPB0Hwlhw I came here on a date for a dinner tasting experience and we had an amazing time. The food was absolutely delicious: the foie gras was to die for, it is a must try! The restaurant has a beautiful ambiance, with little touches such as cute painted plates. And of course, the service was impeccable!
