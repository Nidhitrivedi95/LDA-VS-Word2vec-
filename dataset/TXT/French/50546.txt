OYHpqY6-3C-wXR-uPbHhwA Great coffee, sweets, and quiche! 
I never noticed this place until Yelp so we went to satisfy my quiche craving and ended up with a Danish, steak and eggs, and super yummy home fries! Also a cappuccino and regular house coffee. I would love to come back and try their fruit tarts and they even have gelato ! A great little place here on the north side
