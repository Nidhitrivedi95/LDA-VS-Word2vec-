s1w-XoUJ2wuK9OJ7ivpi3Q Once again I had a delicious meal at CB's.  I also learned that they are now opened Tues.-Sat. from 7 a.m.-2 p.m. for $5.00 breakfasts and $6.00 lunches......and INCLUDES coffee and/or beverage.  Besides being such an attractive room to dine in, the food is really excellent.  Weekend Brunch Menu is still served on Saturdays and Sundays (sometimes along with guest entertainment).  What a great addition to the restaurants in Henderson!!
