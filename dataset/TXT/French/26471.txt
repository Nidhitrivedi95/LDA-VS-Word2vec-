D7CnTsm8SCmbQghz1ioPdw So I don't like game meat much and I refuse to eat anything that contains blood.... Even if these thing are present on the menu, the few choices that were left were absolutely amazing!
Homemade pasta with wild mushrooms and poached egg... Delicious!!!!
Summer salad... Original,refreshing and delicious!
Half smoked chicken served with poutine... Decadent and again, delicious!
The decor is great and cozy. I went with a two year old boy  and they made me feel super welcome, which is very nice for a restaurant of that caliber.
Owner is very friendly and so is the staff. 
Highly recommend. Enjoy!!!!!
