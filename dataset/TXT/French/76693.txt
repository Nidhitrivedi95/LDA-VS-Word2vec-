Yp9w4nhUowBU_IS_StFXbQ This restaurant definitely represents The Wynn well.  Very classy...and immaculate quality! The coffee is smooth and the juice is fresh! (cold pressed fresh orange juice for me this morning) you will love it! Just make sure you bring your wallet with your appetite... :)

The chef even came out to my friend with a gluten allergy to let him know he recognizes that he has the allergy and it will be well taken care of.  We didn't even ask for that or make a deal of it.  The server did it on his own.  Beautiful ambiance as well....they make you feel like royalty. 

Well played Steve Wynn...well played....
