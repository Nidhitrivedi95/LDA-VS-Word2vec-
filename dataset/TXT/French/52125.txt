pmrHuQiy25xKB86tbOLBlA My fiance and I headed here for restaurant week excited to try a new place in the area that looked to have a unique menu. However, I was even hesitant to make a reservation as the man on the phone was not very welcoming and acted as if I should be lucky to get a spot during restaurant week. All that aside, we made a Friday evening reservation. 

Downtown Matthews is a cute, quaint area and the restaurant fits right in...from the outside. Walking in you feel like you're walking into someone's dining room unexpectedly. We honestly thought we came in a side door. The reservation I made was apparently put under my last name, which they could not find. I understand my last name isn't easy, however if that is what you are to note it under then ask me to spell it or clarify. 

Atmosphere: The waitress was extremely nice and welcoming. However, the table we were sat at was right next to the "bar". The bar consisted of one of the owners sitting and yelling orders, moving stuff around in an already loud and dark setting.

Food: The menu set much higher expectations than what came out on the plate. The presentation was great. I ordered the steak, medium, but got rare. The flavor was good so I was hoping to eat more but couldn't get past the mid section that was dripping inside but burnt outside. My fiance got the mushroom parmesan crusted chicken which also had good flavor, but a soggy skin ruined the texture and removed most of the flavor once you got to the meat. Dessert was supposed to be a flour less chocolate cake that appeared to be quite fluffy and moist.

If you are looking for quality and a nice relaxing meal I could not recommend Sante. Gordon Ramsey would certainly have a lot to yell about here as well.
