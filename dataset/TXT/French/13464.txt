4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw One of my lovely coworkers brought me here for breakfast and we were seated on the terrace overlooking the strip on a warm sunny day. The atmosphere was wonderful! 

We both had coffee and shared a coffee cake. They give you a generous piece which makes it a great item to share as it's delicious with the coffee.

We were both in the mood for eggs benedict, so my coworker had a regular Eggs Benedict and I had a Crab Cake Eggs Benedict. The food was fabulous. The quality of the food for the price is great, especially considering the location!

The reason I didn't give a 5-star review is because of the service. It wasn't bad, it was just too casual for the restaurant and the waitress seemed rather unprofessional.
