rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A We had the pleasure of dining at Bouchon recently and found it to be an incredible experience.  The mussels were amazing... so plump, juicy and fresh!  Had a half order as an appetizer and it arrived with a huge cone of frites.  They were so wonderful.  McDonalds fries pale in comparison!!!  Wish the waiter had warned us about the fries, because we had also ordered steak frites.  So many delicious frites went to waste.  The endive orange salad was divine, as well as the succulent lamb.

The waiter was good, yet crafty... had us order a carafe of sauvignon blanc when a glass would have sufficed.  It was a big up charge.  And it was incredibly floral, when he said it would not be.  We also had to flag someone down to get the wine when our appetizer was already there.  When will servers realize that the wine, or cocktail, comes first!!  That is soooo irritating.

Wish we had room for dessert, but ended up coming back for beignets  and cafe au lait on Sunday morning served by this delightful girl (wish I could remember her name) who always works the weekend brunch bar.  It was wonderful sitting in this beautiful sunlight room dipping the delicious beignets into the warm nutella.

I was fortunate to have dinner at French Laundry once and thought it to be a excellent experience, but the food at Bouchon is just as memorable, even though it is not at the same culinary level.  It is just as delicious, fresh, and well prepared as the culinary haven in Yountville... all at a quarter of the price.

Why 5 stars with the sub par service?  Because the food, host, and management levels were above and beyond most restaurants anywhere.

Having dinner Saturday and Sunday brunch at the bar end of July, and I can't wait!!  Maybe I will remember what's her names name this time.

Eat here, you will love it.
