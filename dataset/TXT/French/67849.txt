V0iYi5OjdRcz82m95jV7vQ This bakery is soooooo awesome! Food that has layers of flavor and is capable of awakening all your senses is what you find here!! I can only think of the movie Ratatouille and what the joy of good food can be. I tasted their "Opera" cake today and all I could do was say "Yumm" It was that good. I was without words. I typically do not write reviews, as I find a lot of food just adequate. In the case of Renaissance Patisserie, it is delightful! Joyful! Bravo!
