YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g Great food, good ambiance (if you get seated in the back) and a reasonable price given the sophistication of the food and the preparation. 

The staff can be a bit uppity and the wait staff in particular is hit or miss (like many restaurants) but the food is almost always outstanding. 

Everything I've eaten at Fleur was prepared well. A few times the food was not as warm as I'd like but they were busy. Lunch is a particularly good value here.
