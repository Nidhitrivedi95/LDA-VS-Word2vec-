xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g I don't have the Joel Robuchon dollaz quite yet but I still wanted bougie food to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday. Most of Yelp's reviews are good, praising the food. Any bad reviews are attributed to bad service. I ate there on a Monday night (7/5) and the service was great! When we first got there, the table wasn't ready, so we waited in the bar which was dark but I felt sexy just sitting there. We got seated in front of the window, the Bellagio fountain show is great for filling awkward silence. Our waiter greeted us and he was very friendly, although he started out with an Irish accent and by the end of the meal it was Van Damme/George St. Pierre. 

We ordered: 
-Foie Gras with braised bing cherries
-Sea bass with tomato quinoa (I've never had quinoa so delicious)
-Beef wellington (good sized portion, we left with take home)
-Crispy Pomme Dauphines (the serving size is a lot for 2 people)
-chocolate souffle for dessert

We also ordered 3 cocktails and our bill came out to about $180. Considering it's Las Vegas and a bottle of water will cost you $2.50, our bill wasn't bad. The food was good, the view was great, service is friendly. The only thing was we didn't get a special birthday treat for the birthday boy so I'll knock off a star for that.

Don't forget to:
-Dress up
-Make reservation
-Order a souffle in the beginning
