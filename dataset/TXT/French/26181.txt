d482l58ho0_IMdFkXX1F5Q The 7 ounce flat iron was possibly the best steak I've ever eaten. Let's put it this way, I gave a bite to my wife who is not fond of steak, and she wound up having many bites after that. It was cooked medium rare, to perfection, tender with a phenomenal taste. My wife had the herb crusted halibut and it was very good as well. Yes the entrées are pricey but our meal was worth every penny. Excellent attentive and pleasant service, even though we arrived just before closing.
