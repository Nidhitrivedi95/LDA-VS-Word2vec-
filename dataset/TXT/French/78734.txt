ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug Pretty good experience overall. The wait was a little much for a Monday morning, but no where as long as all the rest. Bloody Mary's were pretty darn good, but lacked that real tomato-ey flavor I crave. I really enjoyed my corned beef hash, my partner enjoyed her oatmeal, dad liked his omelette and mom loved her quiche. We would definitely go back if given the opportunity even if it was a little on the pricey side(but what isn't anymore, in Vegas?).
