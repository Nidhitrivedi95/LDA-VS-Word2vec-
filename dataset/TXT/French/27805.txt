dU7SLTS6_HWo1YPHZ4DmOw We visited L'avenue Bistro on a weekday with a groupon which comes with a bottle of wine and a 3 course meal each for me and my fiancé. The interior of the restaurant was full of personality and we loved the decors. Service was not too bad and the restaurant filled up quickly for dinner service. On the other hand, food was a hit or miss. Complimentary baguette slices also came out cold so the bread was a bit tough to chew on. We ordered the salad and the escargot for appies from the groupon menu which we enjoyed eating. The downfall was us ordering the moules et frites in addition to the groupon dinner and the mussels were awful! The mussels tasted incredibly fishy as they were not very fresh. We couldn't even finish the mussels as it give off a slight ammonia scent. The entrees were Beef bourguignon and steak, both were very good. Dessert was pistachio crème brulee which we thought was subpar as there were pistachio chunks that have softened throughout our crème brulee. Shiraz wine was great, no issues with that. Wished we never ordered the mussels and chose another dessert!
