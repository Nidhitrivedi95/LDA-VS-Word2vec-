50-xiTYmE6NERi-yJ6NvHw I really enjoyed both my visits here. They have a $35 set menu that's delicious. For the set menu, I had the beef bourguignon and the romaine salad. I was shockingly delighted by the salad. I thought it was a simple caesar salad but there was a tanginess to it. When I read it, it turned out to be something else (cannot recall), but even my friend who hates anything cheesy or creamy thought the salad dressing was well done. The fried onion was a nice touch as well. I really liked the beef. It was really tender, and although it was not in the traditional beef stew form, I enjoyed eating it with the gnocchi. I also had the duck, which was on the regular menu. It was very good, cooked medium rare, perfectly, and seasoned well (asian food is very flavourful and so I do like my food on the well-seasoned, salty end). My friend had a special the second time I went, it was parpadelle with beef tenderloin, I believe. The parpadelle was made in-house and was amazing. The beef was good as well, overall a very good dish.

Some problems my party faced was with the chicken and fish. The chicken was a tad pink inside, but the waiter explained to us that it was cooked a certain way that leaves the colour so. He assured us that the chicken was cooked. I tried it, and it was certainly cooked, but the colour definitely bothered my friend, who has a sensitive stomach and was worrying about her stomach the rest of the night. The fish I tried was a bit overcooked on the inside, but seasoned well. It came with little bits of duck confit, and so it was a bit too rich for my cousin's taste. Besides the sorbet, which is really good, the dessert was mediocre, which was a disappointing. 

The service was good both times and I will be going again.

P.S. They have $1 oysters after 5 p.m. I believe. Not the best oysters, but a good deal for oyster lovers.
