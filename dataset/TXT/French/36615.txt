i5vxtyiHKYnRcJ0p9N7mLw I've been excited to try this place out based on reviews and it didn't disappoint.  Authentic Italian delis are hard to come by in the East Valley and this one measures up to my favorites in New York and New Jersey where I grew up.

4 of us split two antipasto salads and a large #2 which is to die for.  A large sandwich made on their homemade bread is really two full small sandwiches.  Plenty of food.

Run, do not walk here!
