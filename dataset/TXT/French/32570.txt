gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg This Brasseurs is just as crowded as their other locations. Service was fine.

Ordered their blonde (L3B) artisan beer. A half pint was only C$3.75. Not bad, and quite swiggable. Of course, I got myself vodka and Red Bull - Canadian Red Bull (called "Base"), that is.

If you want a drink, and want it dependable, stop in. Still, there are better places in Montreal.
