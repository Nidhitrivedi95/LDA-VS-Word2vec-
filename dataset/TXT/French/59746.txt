When one goes into the building you can be overwhelmed by the opulence and obvious in your face glamour of the place. However this does not mean its all high prices and poor service.

I had a very nice pot of coffee with a scone etc and my fellow business visitor also had a similar light tea from the extensive menu. It came to less than £10 and that included a service charge of 10%. Everything about the place was clean and attention was given by the staff to anything you asked for.

Downside was the attitude to being offered a debit card for a bill less than £10 which only shows the owners have not checked around the market for less service charges on their merchant account (something I know a lot about).

So if you want flash along with good service when in central Edinburgh try this place. If you want higher prices in less clean and pleasant surroundings there's plenty to choose from near by.
