nXlKHnArL3_vugmnytsEYQ Crested Duck Charcuterie is an AMAZING restaurant.  Kevin, the owner and chef is such a nice, talented young man with great ideas.   The food is very fresh- in fact, some of the freshest food you'll taste in Pittsburgh. They source locally.  They are a tapas style restaurant, which is great because you can practically try everything on the menu.  They are also a BYOB, bonus points! You can tell that Kevin puts in a lot of thought and care into his dishes. This is definitely a place for adventurous foodies!  We will definitely be back for the spring menu. This place is going to do really well.
