Edulis does not try to impress with fancy decor or colours and shiny objects. Rather it puts all of its efforts and focus on what matters, the food.

Each dish is meticulously crafted to bring out and compliment the natural flavours and textures of the seasonal ingredients.

Delicious, simple and memorable. My wife and I went all out and got the 7 course with white truffle for our anniversary. The element of surprise, not knowing the menu made the dining experience a lot of fun and special.

We were there for 4 hours, but they flew by, like nothing,

The only dish that was slightly below fantasticx was the aged duck breast, which was a little cold and chewy.

Yet everything had a delicious earthen flavour, all lead by some delicious root, be it an onion, leek or garlic, sometimes pulses, and greens.

One of the standout dishes was the soup with foie gras and an old hen broth... I had no idea those menopausal birds had such delicious bones... (kudos to the knowledgeable and friendly waitstaff)

Can't wait to go again! (Albeit, not anytime soon, without selling an arm/leg)...
