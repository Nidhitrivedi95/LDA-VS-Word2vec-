JFfZDmNAoa_MHG16K2BY6A We celebrated an anniversary at Loire and the manager/ waiter went out of his way to make the night very special.  We shared an appetizer and each had a main, which were superb, every last bite.  The wine was incredible as it was one of the last left of an exquisite batch, and they may even hold on to the last few for us if we return!  I will definitely be back, not only because of the fond memory of the evening, but the service was great not to mention the food.  If you can afford to splurge every now and then, make Loire one to try...
