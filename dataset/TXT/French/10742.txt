4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I love the location first and foremost. Directly across from the Bellagio fountains!! Prices are med range for the strip and service has been excellent every visit! Not part of total rewards though as I recall.   As always, they start you off with a warm baguette and whipped butter which you can definitely fill up on. We then always start with the Three cream cheese w/ roasted garlic and mushrooms. I love it. The salmon salad is delicious and the steak is the bomb!! Try finishing with the lemon creme brulee! Exellent place to people watch, prices decent, and the fountains at night are beautiful.
