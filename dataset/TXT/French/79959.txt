ZrHU8ZzwZQjTRpB1K_8JTQ I was looking forward to trying this place out since the review in the paper sounded promising.  I was sadly disappointed.  First off, the reservation system needs work.  If you reserve online, you may need to call to make sure they record it.  Second, the upstairs back room is cold and loud.  There are many stairs, so if you have limitations be sure to remain on the main level.  Third, the bar area is very small.  Don't plan on having a drink before dinner.  And lastly, the Friday fish fry was a bit bland and everything was room temperature.  The fish was no where near the temperature it should be. 

On the plus side, our server was extremely nice and accomodating.  She was attentive and tried to correct any issues we had.  However, only one piece of fish out of twelve managed to be hot.

In an area where fish fry's are abundant and well done they really miss the mark.  At the price point they're at I expect much better.  Unfortunately I cannot put Stamm House on my list of places to return to.
