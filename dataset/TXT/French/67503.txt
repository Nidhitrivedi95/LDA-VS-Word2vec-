UxWH8zRYIBgs6Q2oykvRdw Had very high hopes for this stunning, French inspired bistro. The decor is absolutely regal and spares no expense. I was ready for Classic European brunch! 

Perhaps it was too soon into their opening for a visit as many of the service glitches have not been ironed out. We ordered french press coffee and water to start...and waited for nearly half an hour to receive it. Then we ordered brunch...and proceeded to wait nearly 45 minutes until receiving 3/4 of the order. My partner ordered the pastry basket (the only thing not prepared) and this arrived well after most of our party had almost finished their meals! As well, a server took away my half full coffee press; at almost $5, I'd like to finish that! They kindly brought a fresh one free of charge. 

The food was stunning! However, some of the hot food (frites, eggs) was tepid. Despite  service glitches (having to ask twice to pay, never receiving water until when paying the bill), I would certainly give this bistro a well deserved second chance. The cuisine and decor are far too promising!
