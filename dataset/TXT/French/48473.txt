The short ribs are fantastic... meat falls off the bone. Trout served skin side up and a bit crispy-delicious! And the fries are always amazing. Chef has different specials daily that are worth exploring. He's reinvigorated this place. Excellent! Worth noting, the drink menu and wine list it great, and it boasts one of the best patios in town.
