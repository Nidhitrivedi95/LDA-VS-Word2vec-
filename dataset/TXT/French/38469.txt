JJ1Ruu37kn66YSWUmCKNCw I was pleasantly surprised. The ambience is ideal. The food isn't bad. The pasta was very tasty. I agree with others, the calamari was mediocre but overall it was a good experience.

I feel bad about the workers there, we were a group of 15 or so people and only one girl was there serving us.


Update (September 2017): Went again, had the same pasta, still as tasty as I remember. 

FYI, kitchen closes around 10pm but the restaurant closes at 11:30pm.
