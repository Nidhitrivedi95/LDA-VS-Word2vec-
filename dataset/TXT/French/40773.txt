kcF-en40P3J9L8nLy5lKqQ Like others in the area, we waited and watched as this space developed into Central Bistro.  The atmosphere is delightful, albeit loud.  With the windows open (gotta love Phoenix this time of year!), it was glorious.  I do wonder what the sound level will be like once the windows are closed.

Food is delicious.  Service good.  One Big Problem - on 2 visits we observed bartenders prepping garnish with bare hands.  I mean, peeling an orange with juice running down his hands and arms, then slicing it up to use in drinks.  Last visit we observed a bartender putting his hand down into the olive jar, grab a handful and put them in the garnish tray.  I immediately took the olives out of my martini!

Please - to the wonderful people at Central Bistro:  Get it together before Maricopa County comes to visit.
