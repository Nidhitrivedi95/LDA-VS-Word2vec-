-ClafaRWkSRTfieIzO4r3Q I'm giving this place 1 star because the food was the only decent thing about the whole experience. We went here last month and the service was awful ! I arrived before my friends and asked for a table and the lady who did not so much greet me told me it was a 45 minute wait or I could sit outside. So I said okay I'll go outside and then she said alright and walked away (I thought she was going to grab menus and lead me outside) but she went to go serve a table. 

I sat outside for 10 minutes and no one came out to see if I needed anything or if any other guests had arrived. After my friends had arrived (going on 20 minutes) a guy came out twice to check on other tables (even passed ours and said nothing). In all fairness he may have thought we had been served, but no menus or drinks on the table should have been a clue ?
After 30 minutes when we really should have left we flagged him down and he apologized and said he would go grab the server. 
Of course our server was the lady who told me I could sit outside and walked away. We ordered drinks and had to wait to order food because she finally brought menus at this point. After that it went more downhill, along with another 25 minute wait for our food, it all came at different times so we couldn't even enjoy our meal together. Also one of the sides I had personally ordered just never came! 
At this point we had been there for an hour and a half and we had to go inside to ask for the bill. There was only about 6 people in the restaurant at this time and it would have been nice to be told that there was inside seating available after asking for it in the first place.
Moral of the story there is great places in the city with southern food with fabulous service. Sadly this place does not offer both and not being able to support a local business really sucks.
