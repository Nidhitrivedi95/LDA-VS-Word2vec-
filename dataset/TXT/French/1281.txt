_T7f2wUgNlJqxsR-cR89SQ My lovely boyfriend took me here for our Anniversary dinner. I'm reading all these reviews about Lobsterlicious - which I'm sad we missed!

Regardless, this restaurant encompasses why we pay more to eat at a fancy restaurant. The service is impeccable (5 stars).

It's unfortunate i can't seem to remember what the appetizer I ordered was called but it was amazing. It was off-menu/special of the day. It was a light pasta with pesto and tomato and onions and mushrooms, etc. My main was the Patridge - which was mediocre as I felt the meat was really bland/flavourless. Regardless, I still loved this restaurant!

My boyfriend ordered the soup of the day and the Lamb. He loved it! Oh and for desserts we got the Coconut Creme Pie and Creme Brulee - amazing! 

The view is nice added touch too :).
