The folks at the table who got the chocolate dessert seemed happier with their choice.    If you go before sundown, make sure that you don't sit facing the windows as the sun reflecting off the windows across the street is blinding.    The servers were clearly aware of the problem but had no fix except to tell us to wait 15 minutes until the sun went down (!).    The servers were otherwise properly attentive but not overbearing for a high end restaurant.
