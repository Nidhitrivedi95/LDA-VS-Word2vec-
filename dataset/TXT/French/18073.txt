A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g I bought mango slush the server gave me a cup of to go Coffee , they run out of cup for slushy drink. She didn't even ask me if it's ok to put it this cup. Not even a straw just hand it and said we don't have cup that's why I put it in a togo coffee drink cup which is a not even large cup size . And she insist it's the same cup for large. So disappointed to this place. Making decision if it's ok to me. Worst customer service ....
