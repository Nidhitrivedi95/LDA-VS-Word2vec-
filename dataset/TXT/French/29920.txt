L'Entrecote St-Jean was founded by a French immigrant who opened its first restaurant in the Vieux Quebec in the 80's. Then came down to Montreal to put foot on Peel street in the heart of downtown Montreal. The restaurant has a nice feel to it. You are greeted warmly upon your arrival. It definitely resembles the French bistros in Paris. Their menu is very simple you either choose a striploin or a sirloin with salad or soup. The concept is very singular but I guess it's a Steak Frites and I shouldn't expect more. They have a nice wine list with few reserve privée. I was not wowed by the soup and lacked flavor. The salad was extremely oily and so very vinagery (my own expression ) I chose the striploin which was very chewy with lots of veins. I have to say their secret sauce as they call it was good. I didn't take any desert that evening because of too much  which by the way was fresh and kept coming. The coffee was not the best I have tasted. So, the place looks really nice but the food is disappointing. I am sure with the price they charge they can get better cuts. I am not sure if I would be back.
