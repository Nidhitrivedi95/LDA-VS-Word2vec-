AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw Came here for brunch by myself. I ordered the salmon eggs benny. I love how they used a croissant rather than an english muffin. It seemed a bit lighter because the croissant was buttery and flakey. Egg was perfectly poached.  I requested my sauce to be on the side because sometimes I feel like salmon can be a bit salty. I will definitely come back here for a quick bite. Excellent customer service.
