Yp9w4nhUowBU_IS_StFXbQ Located in the Wynn Casino, came here especially because there is something for everyone.  If you have special dietary needs, ask for one of their allergen or vegan menus.  I have heard that Steve Wynn was vegan for a period, and makes sure there is vegan options available in his restaurants.  I saw on their website that Wynn and Encore have teamed with vegan chef Tal Ronnen to offer unique and healthy alternatives any time of the day.  This made it an easy choice to come here.  I thoroughly enjoyed my Orecchiette with wild mushrooms, asparagus and fresh tomatoes!  My friend had the salmon burger with French fries and house made ketchup.  He raved about the ketchup, and so I tried it out with a French f.ry.  The ketchup was so good, I almost wished I had something to put the ketchup on!

The service was impeccable, the atmosphere was charming with cozy comfortable chairs. They even had these cute little purse stools, for your purse!  I'm planning on another trip to Vegas in October, definitely planning on returning then!
