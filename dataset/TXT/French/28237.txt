E9HkUYYO_-5vKjvBwLuDIw Oh La La is exactly what Las Vegas needs - a French restaurant that feels like home, where you feel comfortable coming in to eat delicious food on a regular basis. Service was impeccable and friendly. Pellegrino with lime was served upon being seated. Olive oil & herb bread came shortly thereafter. My hubby ordered French onion soup which tasted homemade. My salad with encrusted goat cheese was the perfect combo of tangy, fresh & savory. Hubby had the steak with frites, which came with an onion jam to die for. I had the French version of shepherds pie, very filling and seasoned nicely. Richard, the owner, sent out a crock of warmed goat cheese with caramelized onions & honey. I will be dreaming about coming back for that dish, as well as for the tiramisu, seriously the best tiramisu I've ever had. Richard recommended our wine, which comes from the region in France near Provence where he was born. Great recommendation!  We will be back!  Fantastic!
