8nWjW3T35-Mw0tcffe1KIg Food was marginal, service wasn't bad, prices were high.

M'lady and I had an appointment for 5:30, which turned out to be when they opened. We got there at 5:15 and waited in front of the venue until 5:29 P.M. to have the door unlocked.

The appetizer included with the meal was 4 slices of white bread. M'lady and I shared a veggie poutine appetizer, which we rather enjoyed. I had a lamb meal that consisted of beans, beef, and a potato slices and stacked. I found the meat to be rather chewy and the sauce to be a tad sour. The potato was really nice. For desert, I had a blueberry crême brulée which was unevenly torched at the top so there was some untorched sugar in some parts. I did not find its taste very appetizing either.

The service all-in all was OK. No table checks, but I personally prefer having more time to spend with m'lady. The waitress did spill my water at one point on the table by knocking my glass to the side with a plate, and never came to clean it up.

I wouldn't mind trying the Sunday brunch at some point, although this venue is a bit above my usual spending range. I'd also likely come back for the poutine, however the rest of the meal I wasn't a huge fan of.
