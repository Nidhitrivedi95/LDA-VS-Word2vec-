SJo_IjvzdRtCvZVN0cbrRQ NOT your average breakfast!  It is awesome--they make bacon and eggs that are out of this world as it is very flavorful.  Other options are the house made granola with locally sourced milk and yogurt.  The one time we were able to order the quiche, before it disappeared, it was really good.  Recently tried the apple cider and of course, it was awesome!

Wes and the gang do a fantastic job!
