rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A What we didn't like is the lack of vegetarian selection for savory items on the breakfast menu. My husband switched out the ham for slices of tomatoes and mushrooms and got charged extra, which is odd. I had the smoked salmon with the baguette. The Salmon was fresh, but nothing was extraordinary. The service was a little slow- took awhile for us to get our food. 
What we did like-  great coffee ( I had 3 cups) and a really yummy brioche, which means I will have to try their pastries next time- perhaps it would be better than the savory breakfast items.
