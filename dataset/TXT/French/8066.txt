4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw The best bread and butter anywhere on the strip! Took me back to living in France and stuffing my face silly with fresh baguettes. The pickled carrot dish that comes with the bread was also very delicious. The desserts are phenomenal-- my friend said the chocolate caramel tart was "the best dessert of her life."

The hostesses at the front were extremely rude but our waiter couldn't have been nicer. I hope the hostesses can learn from the waitstaff and be a little nicer to guests.
