jT-KFrbwr5iE-_vrVLpmiw Food was really good but they lacked in service. We got there on a rainy Sunday morning for brunch.  We walked up to the cash register line to order for food and since it was our first time we just looked around and ordered whatever interested us. Apparently some things were unavailable because it was on their lunch menu which wasn't available yet at the time we got there. ..but no where on the menus said that. Speaking of menus, they only had drinks menu clearly visible, food menus were on a few tables,but that's pointless when we're suppose to order up front first at the cash so we many of us in line didn't realize til after we ordered from what we saw on display through some struggles.. anyways after we told a lady what we wanted as we approached the cash register two customers in front of us were complaining as well about the service that it was slow and unorganized. When it was our turn the cash lady couldn't find our order that was done ..poor communication between the staff themselves. 

I'd still give this place 3 stars despite the unpleasant service because their food was good, you can tell their ingredients were fresh and presentation was nice.
