xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g This was the perfect restaurant for our big night out. The wife and I had an amazing time here. I am from Las Vegas but never get use to how breath taking the lights can be. The view of the Bellagio fountains here are amazing. The food from appetizers to main course were spectacular.  The carmel soufflé was spot on. It would also like to say that our waiter was very knowledgable of the cuisine and always there for us. It was worth the money for such an important night.
