ovtlrcsVRlgZZQUlHs_ovw I love this place! 

First time I came here was not long after they opened in 2008, we just happened to stop by because I was pregnant, it was late, and I was dying for something other then fast food.  The place was dead and I had never heard of it before so I didn't know what to expect, but there was a goat cheese and beet salad that sounded good so I went ahead and ordered it.  Let me tell you, it was one of the best salads I have ever had in my life! The plate was beautiful. there were 3 types of beets and the goat cheese was to die for, and topped with what tasted like a reduced balsamic dressing.  
My second trip there was more recently in May of this year, the only reason I hadn't been back was because of having a baby and losing my job so my wonderful sister took myself and my husband for our Anniversary. The place was much busier this time, and did not disappoint. We started with the herb and goat cheese flat bread along with fresh raw kumamoto oysters, the flat bread was delicious and beautiful. The oysters which are very hard to come by in there area were tender and very fresh. My entree was the cedar planked salmon, the salmon was perfectly cooked, moist very flavorful. I can't remember the sides since and all I remember is drooling over the salmon. Coming from the Northwest it had been a long time since I had salmon that tasted that fresh.

To sum it up, this place is not "cheap" in any way, if you want Red Robin then go to Red Robin, but if you want top quality elegant food with an amazing staff then you must try Vogue!! Hopefully it will be in surprise for years to come!
