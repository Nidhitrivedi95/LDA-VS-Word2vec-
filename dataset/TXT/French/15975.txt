There was a bit of a questionable moment in the beginning, as I walked in and there was no one to great us. I had to stand by the door for a good 5 minutes before anyone saw us. It might be because of the configuration of the house, since it isn't open concept and the server had to move from room to room constantly during the night. 

I had the Salad Bowl, which was a mix of a bunch of greens with nuts and black rice. A good texture combination and one of the lighter options available on the menu. I'm not sure what about this place makes it 'French' though, since most of the menu items can be found in most restaurants. Also, I would have given the place a higher rating if it wasn't for the price. My salad without any protein was $15, while a burger can easily be $20. That is easily more than most restaurants in downtown Toronto. A good place to come if you want to treat someone, but definitely not for the everyday meal.
