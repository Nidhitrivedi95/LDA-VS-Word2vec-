rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I had just come from Bouchon Napa, so I had pretty high expectations for this place.  The venue has the exact same feel, plus an outdoors pool/fountain area.  No complaints there.

The sommelier was extremely helpful in picking a red and a white for the table.  Our waiter was more than knowledgeable, reciting the nightly specials like telling his life story.  He really does know the list forwards and backwards!

We started with a dozen oysters for the table, three of each kind.  It came with the cutest little bottle of Tabasco, which we promptly finished.

I shared the halibut and the trout, which were both excellent.  But honestly, I was sold at haricot verts.  It's the simple things.

And for dessert, we must have ordered half the menu.  The profiteroles, pot de creme, and all three of their dessert specials.  Talk about fatties!
