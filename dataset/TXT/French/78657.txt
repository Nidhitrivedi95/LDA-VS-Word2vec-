ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug One afternoon we spent a few hour's walking around Paris.  This cafe is located right next to the casino.  It is so pretty with outdoor seating, just like a a real cafe on the streets of Paris.

We sat down to order some lunch.  Oh look Keno.  I so enjoy playing Keno, my brother in law and I decided to play ten games, as we waited for our lunch. We started with a cheese platter with a fresh baguette, and fruit.  The fruit was very fresh especially the strawberries and blueberries.

I ordered a salad and half sandwich for lunch.  My salad was crisp and good but my sandwich was cold chopped up chicken, in which I do not like so I did not touch.  My fault I should have asked if it was grilled chicken.  No biggie I filled up on salad. My sister and brother in law both ordered mushroom crepe's in which they said was very good.

Neither one of us hit anything on Keno, bummer.  Lunch was OK,  it was as if we were dining at a diner.  Not to far in the shopping area there was a small cafe that we wished we would have ate at, they had fresh sandwiches, salads that looked incredible and cheese platters with some amazing looking desserts.

Service was slow and not very friendly here.
