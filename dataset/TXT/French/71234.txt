xcmmTXhuMx2fZF2Bt69F4w Before this trip we've never been to Point Breeze before.  It's a really nice community and the Point Brugge Cafe just happens to be rightly nestled in this cozy neighborhood.  We had a short wait as the place was very busy.

We had come on Sunday so we went with the brunch.  We each had the prix fixe.  My wife had the 20 dollar version with the Grand Marnier French toast, potato strudel and Bloody Mary.  I had the 24 version with the Benedict on crab cakes, apple smoked bacon and a Bloody Mary as well.

The Eggs Benny were good.  It was really different having them with crab cakes as it's not something I eat very often.  While I enjoyed my breakfast I really liked what my wife had ordered over what I had.  The French toast was simply amazing.  It was baguette and not too eggy and not too sweet but it was simply perfect in every way.  The toast was toasted just with enough crunch with the egg and cinnamon.  It was really very good.  The potato strudel was a dense and creamy and a nice savory  complement to the French Toast.  

My wife ended up ordering a coffee and I ended up having both Bloody Marys.  They were really nicely spiced, just the way I like them.

The service was friendly and staff were attentive.  

Overall this was a wonderful brunch.  I'd like to return for another meal on the next trip... wonderful place!
