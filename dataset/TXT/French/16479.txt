8BT-nH2aWf6nyIdK797OHA We are usually not steered wrong when a restaurant has an average 4 star rating. But we were sorely disappointed. The small restaurant was quite full and busy (although we began at 8 pm so most dinners were on dessert/ coffee), and we had the last available table. There was only one server for all, and one person in the kitchen. We found the server curt and abrupt. The cold avocado-cucumber-mint soup was underwhelming; my wife found some piece of organic, inedible, wood-like material (the stem, perhaps). The poached pear salad would have been nice: but came with a very disappointing amount of goat cheese. The menu described our main "with greens". I assumed that meant cooked rapini, broccolini or Swiss chard, but instead was simply romaine lettuce and arugula. We left without dessert.
