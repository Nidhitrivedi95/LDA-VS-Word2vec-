A8yIKHSI5LFYZ6_H8dZBcg Went here to eat tonight after reading some of the reviews on Yelp and Urbanspoon.  I am from the Caribbean and have a hankering for good oxtail and jerk chicken once in a while that is not by my own hands or that of my kinfolk.  

Chefydrew's does not satisfy the palate.  My companion had the lukewarm oxtail and it was just ok.  Missing was the cloves and pimento for added taste, slow cooking till the meat fell off the bone, and the butterbeans near the end for finish.  There was no love put into the oxtail.

My jerk chicken didn't fare any better.  Again, lukewarm chicken drowned in a spicy sauce.  The same jerk sauce you can buy at any grocer and cover your baked chicken with at home.

The rice and peas were "brown rice and three peas", then an assortment of brightly coloured vegetables on the side.

Even the introductory garlic bread that Chef Drew himself raved about and gave us was lackluster and I wasn't inclined to have more than a few bites.  After all,  I didn't go there for garlic bread.

Overall, a good place to eat if you don't know any better, but we are STILL on the hunt for a restaurant that serves awesome oxtail, and jerk chicken under one roof.
