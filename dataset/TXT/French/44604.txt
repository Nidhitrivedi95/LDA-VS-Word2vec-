mnn--vaYHtNyBNYFYBFIog High end, upscale french restaurant with professional service. It was my birthday dinner and we decided to go for their famous 7-course discovery menu. 

The restaurant is elegantly decorated but not extravagant. Typical french restaurant with beautifully presented bite-sized food in small in a large plate. Classic martini was well mixed with a balanced taste. 

I really like the sea urchin, lobster and the magret de canard (duck breast). The raw foie gras did not impress me. There was a pre-dessert and a dessert, both of which were pretty delicious. 

The whole dinner experience was more than 3.5 hours with each of us only had one cocktail. If I were to go back I would probably go a la carte instead of the tasting menu.
