4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw We've started coming here for the last 3 years based on a friend's recommendations.  The first couple visits the filet mignon with Merlot butter sauce was to die for.  Every visit after the steak has come out with a large pat of cold Merlot butter on top that we've had to send back.  Either that is how it was always supposed to be or there is a new cook in the kitchen but for what I'm paying and to keep coming back here, I expect the sauce to be properly melted, not a cold stick of butter.  The waiter also couldn't have cared less when we pointed out and had to be told we wanted this fixed.  If you don't know how this dish should be prepared it's not a problem, if you've had it as it should be prepared, it is.  

That being said, we'll probably still come here just because out of towners want to come when visiting, but we will not be making reservations anymore on our own.
