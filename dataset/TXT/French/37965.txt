Jbl6p9CVkfCB8fWYFd2-Qw My friends and I came for a birthday lunch and were pleasantly surprised by the decor. The room was big and airy and full of great lighting. But that's pretty much where the pleasantries end.

The waiter was unattentive and frankly quite rude. The first incidence, he forgot my water when he served everyone else at the table. I chalked that up to a large number of people. Forgivable. Second time, he didn't take my order and proceeded to snatch my menu from me. Rude. Third time, he walked away as I handed him my check. Well, I thought maybe bad service was getting my meal comped, but apparently it's just a show of how bad service really can be. 

You would think that if you forgot a customer once, then twice, you might become a little better the third time around. Apparently, that's a no for Isabella staff. Business was not even booming, they were just not good! I was not the only one in my group to feel this way. When we first asked for our checks, our waiter stared at us and said, "that will take me a while." There was only one other table in the restaurant. 

The food was alright but not worth the price. I basically got three fish sticks in tortilla for 15 dollars. Oh, they also threw in some apple slices. I think you could probably get almost anywhere else.
