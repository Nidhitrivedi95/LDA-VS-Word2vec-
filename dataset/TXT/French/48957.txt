OkC86YtZ0Nm19my5F4GGrQ We started sitting outside sipping cocktails and moved on to dinner.  We had the makers mule and a cucumber gin cocktail, both strong but tasty!  
We started with dates and they were great, but the other reviewers are correct... Sweet! The bacon is salty and just almost balances this app out.  
The onion soup is mild and light.  The cheese is creamy.  It makes for a different experience that I highly recommend!  Sitting outside in the summer this was the right version of French Onion. 
Next we had the duck tartine and a special Korean BBQ short ribs. The short ribs were a soft beef jerky smokey treat of an entree!  The duck confit tartine was incredible for the price.  The cheese was so creamy.  We also had some brussels as a side which were good, but no better than what we make at home. We have a killer version.
So after great music, great atmosphere, great company (that part had nothing to do with them) and a great meal - we ordered the flour-less chocolate tart with sea salt Carmel to go! 
A wonderful night out in River! I was giving them a strong 4 and then Georgia by Ray Charles came on and pushed this southern girl right over the edge.  Well played my friend Tartine, well played!  Enjoy the 5!
