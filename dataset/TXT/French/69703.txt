WOd8tWsh2Yt_osHv-ngx_w If I'm too lazy to leave my lil' downtown nook and I'm craving breakfast or brunch, I'll come to Universel. It is by no means a favourite of mine, but definitely not bad either. There's nothing particularly special about this place and the food is just in the 'fine' range, but the place itself looks nice and is never quite empty so it offers a decent ambiance, a reasonable price, and is within proximity to everything downtown. So it's okay, I guess, meh.
