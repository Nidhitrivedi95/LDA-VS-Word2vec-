JsAjP49bCk9KjJmmmjyM4w Guys, these are the best croissants in the city, bar none. Always fresh and warm. Great friendly service. The place is cute and tiny and oh so charming. 

Their clafouti is also amazing, if you can resist purchasing a croissant. 

The coffee is horrible (burnt, always burnt, I hate balzacs) but that's not why you come here. YOU COME FOR THE CROISSANTS!
