hsJ0Ma7RB_dmzAY8H0mu7g my buddy, my fiancee and i came here for dinner recently.. i usually plan everything on my trips but since my buddy did all the research on montreal.. i let him steer us around for dinner.. 

needless to say.. his choice in cuisine is quite impeccable.. 

we grabbed a bottle of beer cultivated by the master chef  (ferran adria) and my fiancee got a glass for wine.. we started off with a wild mushroom pie and the escargot.. both of which were quite good.. although there could have been more escargot.. 

my fiancee got the duck confit which came out looking like a fried duck burrito.. it was pretty disappointing.. 

i got the surf and turf black pudding.. it came with 3 large scallops which were cooked perfectly.. the black pudding was really rich and definitely one of the best things i had during my montreal trip.. 

i forgot what my buddy got.. but i believe it was a beef dish because i remember it not being as good as the beef cheeks i had holder the night before.. 

for dessert.. we got the sugar pie which was really really sweet (yeah.. go figure).. i wasn't exactly a fan of it but we finished it pretty damn quickly.. 

of note.. this place is about a 10 minute walk from the metro
