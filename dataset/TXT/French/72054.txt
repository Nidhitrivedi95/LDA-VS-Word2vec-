XKPosZx2j4RHcZ8Ewdwj0A A truly astonishing classic bistro meal.  Don't go expecting much outside of the classics usually served at a bistro - - if you're going to be disappointed to not see something new & exciting on a menu, this might not be the place for you.

I recently went on a trip out of town.  Went for a (very) late lunch - 3:30 pm - & the restaurant was empty.  We ordered 4 appetizers/entrées (depending on your language of choice) - Calamari with Zuchini, Mushroom Ravioli, Salmon Truffle Tartare, & Steak Tartare with Fries.  

All were truly top-notch, & there was much jockey-ing between the 2 of us to grab this plate or the other.  We were in general agreement that although all 4 were great, but that we weren't sure we'd ever NOT be able to order the 2 tartares if we went back ... they were both truly amazing, & the fries that came with the steak were great too.

we were going to order a creme brulee, but ma copine suddenly asked for the french toast / pain perdu.  despite my initial worry at straying from the classic menu, this desert, as other reviewers have noted, was truly astonishing.  a 4 inch tall piece of unbelievably crusty on the outside / soft on the inside brioche topped with ice cream and caramel - do it, but consider splitting it 2-4 ways !

oh!  & this came as a recommendation from a friend who teaches at The Culinary Institute of America, who advised me that it was the best steak tartare he'd ever had.
