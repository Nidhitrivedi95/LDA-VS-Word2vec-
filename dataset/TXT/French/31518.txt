gjCmXkMNVE0JSk8puUwv6g I LOVE this restaurant!
it's almost like going to an Étoile Michelin!
Staff is very pleasant and professional. 
The food is just delicious, tasty and well presented.

I always order the tomato mozzarella ( REAL mozzarella) and the Mozarella tartine!
the smoked salmon bites is delightful.

Delicious oignons soup!

Their desserts are amazing too!
very "raffiné". we always order the tiramisu, the pana cotta or the little green tea desert. i am not big on sweet but their dessert are so amazing!

the restaurant itself is spacious and well decorated. Modern and sober. Still cozy and lovely  to me 

Perfect place for a date night
