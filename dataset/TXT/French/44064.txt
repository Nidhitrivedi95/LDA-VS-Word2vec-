MdjIl105vqCYUGKFSUVytA I use to frequent Colette when it first opened; loved it just as I love The Chase. We had a horrible experience one night, so we left after appetizers and decided to go to Patria, where they treated us incredibly (as always.)  I haven't been back since and truthfully; with the amount of amazing restaurants in Toronto that understand how important great food and impeccable service is... why would I choose to go back to Colette? My reasoning for the 2 star rating is because the Parisan interior of the restaurant is absolutely stunning, and the sommelier is very knowledgeable. Also, the food is decent but very overpriced for what it is.  If you need a last minute last resort dinner option this will do the trick, just don't expect anything incredible. But with all the new places in Toronto opening up and all the great places I already frequent, I most likely won't go back
