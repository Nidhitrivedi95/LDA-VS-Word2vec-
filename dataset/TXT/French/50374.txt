ovtlrcsVRlgZZQUlHs_ovw I just returned from dinner and I was fairly impressed by Vogue Bistro! My great aunts took me out to dinner and they decided on Vogue because they had heard so many great reviews by word of mouth. We had relatively early dinner reservations and were seated immediately (the place was busy - I would definitely recommend reservations). Great atmosphere - a little on the schmoozy side, but definitely appropriate for a group of friends having dinner or even an intimate date for two. They offered an extensive wine list and the main entrees included a variety of gourmet cuisine which included dishes such as filet mignon, duck confit, and rabbit civet! I ordered a delicious roasted chicken entree and my aunts both ordered the duck special of the evening and were thoroughly pleased. I peeked over at table next to us to see a platter of oysters that looked absolutely scrumptious! Next time I'll surely order that! Aside from the fantastic food, the service was pretty good.... although I will say the busser could have waited for me to put my fork down before asking if I was finished with my plate. Besides that, I enjoyed my dining experience very much!

NOTE: Their cheesy website does NOT do Vogue Bistro justice! I say check out Vogue in person :)
