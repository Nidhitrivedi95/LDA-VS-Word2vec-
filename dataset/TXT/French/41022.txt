Hop on the front of the bar
Let the good drinks flow in your mouth
With a menu like that and so I smile so bright
Oh, you're killing me, you know it ain't fair, yeah
Ride on through the middle of the night
Let the HH drinks kiss my lips
When you cook like that, your service so right
Oh, you're killing me, baby do it again

The Central Bistro, and my mind is on the Central Bistro
And I can Yelp cause it means a thing to me, to me, yeah
The Central Bistro, and my mind is on the Central Bistro
And I can Yelp cause it means a thing to me, to me, yeah yeah

The Central Bistro is located offsite from the hectic Biltmore traffic which I can appreciate.  I love coming here I guess that's what I'm trying to say.  Never too crowded and the food is awesome.  

I always come for HH or as they like to call it "Social Hour", great drink and food specials and they even do reverse HH or reverse "Social Hour"; whatever!  Never the less, it's sweet!  I love the proscuitto melon pizza here!  Not too cheesy and just the right amount of blend or salty cured meat while the melon mellos it out!  At half price during "Social Hour" -- POW! Give me 2!

Drink specials are generally $1 off beers and assortment of small bites.  Perfect for any budget you're coming with.  Again, if you miss our early for Social Hour.  No worries, Central Bistro opens late for reverse Social Hour!  Yah for Social Hour! -- Enjoy!
