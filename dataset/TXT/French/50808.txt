oZHbPhIj01_31jqD053a_Q This was a true "foodie" experience: great service and delicious food from start to finish.  We had a table at the top of the stairs, giving us a view of all the action - including all the dishes as they came up the stairs!  Without repeating the other reviews, my wife's lamb was succulent and sweet - amazing.  I had the most unbelievable deer chop; thick, moist and super flavorful.  With the amuse bouche, breads, intermezzo, and appetizers, it's basically like having a "tasting.". The wine selection was top notch, and the server suggested great choices (by the glass) for each part of the meal. This meal exceeded my expectations in every way.
