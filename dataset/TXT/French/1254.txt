_pUSVvU43NkI8cMAzENCKg We selected his restaurant because it was close to our accommodation.  We noticed that there were no recent Yelp reviews but decided to take our chances.  The restaurant had a few diners when we entered but was clearing out because we were entering during the tail-end of the dinner hours around 8:30pm.  The decor requires a make over.  My adults kids (ages 25 and 23) said that it reminded them of their grandmother's house.  The music was loud and oddly matched to the restaurant; some of it was just unrecognizable, then mostly Michael Jackson's Thriller on a sound track that skipped. The restaurant has a prix-fix menu.  We all enjoyed our starters (soup of the day, goat cheese app and salmon blinis) and they were very accommodating to special dietary requests.  My daughter's chicken main dish was advertised as battered chicken was essentially chicken nuggets with French fries. It looked like something you can order from a children's menu in the States.  My husband's rib eye did not look like any I have every seen.  It looked more like a thin sandwich steak. The first one was burned to a crisp.  The waiter knew it and asked my husband when he saw him taste it.  The waiter was very sorry and rushed to make changes. He even gave us another bottle of wine.  He was trying to make up of the the quality of food.  We even heard him arguing with the chef when he returned the food.  Overall this place seems like it has seen better days.
