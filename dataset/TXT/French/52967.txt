QeFsIMcIFIJcOrpthYL8jg Modavie, known for its lamb dishes, excels in other plates it has to offer. We had steak and wild mushroom risotto with duck confit. Amazing! Dessert on the menu was tiramisu (classic, and well done!) and chocolate molten cake with a scoop of ice-cream (melts in the mouth... love it!) highly recommend!
