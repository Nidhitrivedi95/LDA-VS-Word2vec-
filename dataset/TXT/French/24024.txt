cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg Amazing meal was had here. Great for big parties. We ordered everything with foie and I had one of the most memorable dishes ever! A whole pig head! The gelatinous and meaty nomz that kept me eating for hours. Everything was good except the poutine with foie think because I'm not a poutine fan. We had leftover to nosh on the next two night back at the hotel. Taaaaaaasty!!! Would love to go back again next time I'm in Montreal!
