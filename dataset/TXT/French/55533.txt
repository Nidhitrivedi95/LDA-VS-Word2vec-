rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Loved the breakfast here. We sat outside ... due to the shade and the constant cool breeze from inside the restaurant, we didn't feel hot despite it being 100F temperature at 10am.

Food:
- Beignets: amazing, yummy, potentially second only to NOLA beignets.
- Croque Madame: haven't decided whether I liked the actual croque madame more or the amazing, crispy fries.
- Lamb hash with sunnyside eggs: wonderful flavors. Very hearty and delicious.

Of course, the service was spectacular as well.

Definitely coming back.
