S5gtq6g6dIfyaFvyPYyzkg Whenever we have visitors from outside Edinburgh we always take them to the Dome to experience what must be one of the most beautiful bars in the world (and yes I've seen a few).

It can be described as being more of a tourist attraction than a local.  You can spot the tourist's as they are either looking up at the Dome in amazement or taking photo's.

Staff are friendly as well as very formal.  Serves lovely (expensive) cocktails and champagne.

All in all a must see bar if you visit Edinburgh (even if it's only for a coffee).
