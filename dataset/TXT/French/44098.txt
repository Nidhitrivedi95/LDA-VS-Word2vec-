MdjIl105vqCYUGKFSUVytA Needs to train their staff on service. Food came lukewarm...Sommelier and waitress couldn't pour wine without spilling some on the table... Asked for additional stuffed zucchini flower and were told it's not possible. Ordered a double espresso and a single was delivered. That's how they treat a seating of two that ordered a $300 bottle of wine and Champagne for cocktails... For a total bill of over $500 this was a deplorable experience!
