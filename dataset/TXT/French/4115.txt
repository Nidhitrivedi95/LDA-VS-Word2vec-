be sure to be adventurous and try out their specialities.

my father and i enjoyed the following at lunch:

1. the roasted bone marrow - topped with a delicate lettuce leaf, each selected bone was a different height.  
2. the mustard celery was fantastic!!!! thinly sliced and "pickled" with mustard, i devoured this right up.
3. the veal kidneys with mushroom and house potatoes were excellent!  rich and filling.  this is a must try.
4. the veal liver with perfect fries and homemade mayo is not for the faint of heart.  this was quite a generous portion.  it would be something that i normally would not try but now, i would order it in a second.  the dish was packed full of flavor!

for dessert, we enjoyed a giant but light serving of the floating island - a lovely confection of whipped eggwhites with a sugar caramel crust topped with almond slices and floating on a sea of english cream.  it was the best one that i have ever sampled even compared to all the restos in paris.

fast and friendly service, this is a definite stop for anyone - local or just visiting.  be sure to look around as you may spot a local celebrity or two.
