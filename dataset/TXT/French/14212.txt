58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw Le Cartet is a mix of a chic boutique and a lively brunch house. Long tables that are shared amongst customers take up majority of the space. At the front of the business, one can find savory quick-meals or snacks to go, like sandwiches, salads, chocolates, muffins, smoothies, and so much more.

Peak hours can cause a long and tedious wait, but it is so worth it, especially when you get to feast away on potato wedges fried in duck fat aside creative and unique variations of eggs, french toast, bacon, and whatnot. Moreover, the coffee is freshly brewed, and the juice is squeezed on the spot. 

A local hotspot that is not overpriced, but reasonable in regards to its location in Old Montreal. Definitely worth the visit!
