KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA I have had 4 friend gatherings here!   We did wine pairings every time.  When their are 4 or more in the party, you can try several items on the menu.   We have had everything including dessert.   I Can say, without hesitation, that every single item we ordered was prepared to perfection and with beautiful eye appeal.  We were a little disappointed that one time they were out of the trout but the server suggested another fish and it was a hit!  I really appreciated that they remember us when we return and they let us order apps and wine without hurrying us into the entree and dessert.    The service is exceptional, the view magnificent and the food fabulous!!! A great date night or special occasion dining experience or friends for wine and dinner!
