ZrHU8ZzwZQjTRpB1K_8JTQ Went in for starters and drinks before a movie. There was a wait so we sat at the full service bar. Starters were fantastic! We ordered cheese and charcuterie tray, beef tartare, warm autumnal vegetable salad, and the parker house rolls. Usually there's a miss but essentially everything was great minus the chicken gallantine on the charcuterie tray (they were out of the rabbit terrine :-( ) I would order the beef tartare and rolls every time and would love to try the other salads if they are as good as the one we got. I can't wait to go back and check out the entrees!

Only quibble was the bartender was pretty slow even when we were the only ones at the bar and wasn't especially friendly compared to the other wait staff which was surprising as a bartender. Interested to see how service is when we go and are seated at a table.
