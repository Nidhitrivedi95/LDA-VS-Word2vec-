KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA Marche Bacchus has a gorgeous view, but the food does not stand up (as is often the case).  The quality was average at best.  The lobster croissant that everyone raves about was terrible- a stale croissant unnecessarily toasted and filled with lobster meat that tasted fake.  It was shredded and almost had the texture of "Krab".  Very unappealing, and a very poor rendition of a lobster sandwich.  The signature bread pudding was also sub-par, burnt on top and dry throughout.  Definitely not worth the pre-ordering and 20 minute wait.   Service is disappointing, however the wine store is lovely and has a nice selection at reasonable prices.  The view is great and they have misters (major bonus in summer time), but next time I will be trying Garfield's next door in hopes of a better meal.
