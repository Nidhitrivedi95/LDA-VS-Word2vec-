4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I thought this place was fine, it had its high points so I am ok with 3 stars.  The wild escargots in a good garlic parsley sauce was quite tasty, though nothing like the puff pastry version at Bouchon.  The fresh baguette and butter were ok, not nearly as good as Bardot.  My lamb had a good rustic flavor but was cooked medium well when I asked for medium. The chimichurri sauce was tasty but the ratatouille was bland and boring.  Mashed potatoes were ok, but they are not a pomme purée as stated.  Service was good, atmosphere fair.   I won't be back.
