4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I was not really sure where I wanted to go for dinner, walking along the Las Vegas Strip, one was spoiled for choices.  After watching the fountain's display in front of the Bellagio, we stumble on Mon Ami Gabi, it was a rather warm night, but it still has the heater outside.  As it  gets chilly really fast I decided to enjoy the last bit of the fresh air and use the heater if I needed to.  Plus the menu looks appetizing.  I ordered a Grilled Salmon with Spinach Salad, it was delightfully light, with walnut, grapefruit and a lovely light vinegar dressing.  My other half ordered a Steak Classique, it was done really well, a real medium rare.  The dessert of chocolate mousse and Creme Brulee was also great.  The wine is not cheap, but sitting in the balcony you can watch the Belligio's fountain display. What else do one want?
