O3OH5IEFMPtz7mPKakPZ3Q Pretty presentations and tasty food but barely any of it. Was shocked at how tiny the portions were. 7oz of NY Strip came out looking like 2, MAYBE 3 oz. Staff was nice and eager, but not easy to understand, so we ordered things we thought were included with the meal only to get the bill and find out they were all add ons...and we didn't even get the side that was "supposed to be" included. Menu  is very brief and doesn't explain what is what. Still cant believe how much we paid for such a small amount of food. We won't be going back.
