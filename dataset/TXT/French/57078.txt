rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A We made reservations for dinner a few weeks out and I didn't know what to expect, given that we are fans of Mon Ami Gabi at the Paris and are fairly well-versed on French food, having vacationed in Provence twice.  I've read lots about Mr. Keller and had big expectations, and for the most part those expectations were met:  service was great, dinner was excellent, and ambiance and decor were spot on.  I had the lamb and the wife had the gnocci.  The only complaint I had was dessert:  if you are going to offer/serve a "special" vanilla creme brulee and charge 10 bucks for it, it better be good:  problem was, it was not.  The creme was more like sugary pudding, and I'm not even sure egg was used at all in the recipe..gross.  We left half of it uneaten and made a hasty exit after paying our bill.  Nonetheless, everything else was great and I give it a solid 4/5 stars.
