5fquJHY2hMX9tPRD5s0t5g Winner winner chicken dinner!!  I came here with a group of friends before a show and it was great!  It was a week night and the first thing you need to know is the after work scene is poppin in the ground floor bar area.  It was packed!  But i was here for dinner and went upstairs to the more low key dining area which was nice.  The food was tasty!  I had a quarter chicken with BBQ sauce on the side.  That chicken was roasted to perfection and juicy!  The spinach was tasty, succotash, delish but the potatoes au gratin were dream worthy!  The up side to going with a large group is getting to sample a bit of everything and is was good!  I think we shared a bread pudding for dessert that was delicious and I'm typically not big on sweets.  The service was quick and kind which was a plus and I can't wait to go back....when some one else is paying because it ain't cheap!
