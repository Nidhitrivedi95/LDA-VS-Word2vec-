K67pkQljTFTW_P-7xUQrFw A great apportez-votre-vin pre-going out dinner spot. The food can be hit or miss. The moule are usually my option of choice.  Try to arrive early, as they don't take reservations. With a large group, you can spend a long time hanging around, drinking your own wines and get the bill just in time for the clubs down the street to open up. Classic french cuisine at cheaper than expected prices.
