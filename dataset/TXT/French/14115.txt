58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw I randomly decided to check out Le Cartet last Saturday morning. It's a pretty bustling place. Lots of people and lots of conversation but it's definitely a spot where I could sip something nice and vibe out to a good book.

I ordered a small cappuccino (because I'm obsessed) and loves every ounce of it. Shortly thereafter, my scrambled eggs with goat cheese showed up. To my surprise, the portion was huge. There was fresh fruit on my plate. And, the smoked salmon that I ordered on the side was perfect (yes capers!). Everything that came out of the kitchen looked great and everyone in the establishment looked to genuinely be pleased. The staff was also super friendly (that always helps!).

Honestly, I was pleasantly surprised by Le Cartet. I will definitely have it firmly on the itinerary the next time I'm in Montreal.
