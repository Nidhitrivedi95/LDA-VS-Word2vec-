aaWhSHpsE285eaSTzDxAMA Just had a wonderful dinner at Bistro 185.  The menu is varied,  the wine list is impressive and the service is impeccable. The food is amazing.  The chef trained at the Culinary Institute of America in New York and it shows!   We had the bacon-wrapped scallops with risotto and the meatloaf with caramelized Brussels sprouts and mashed potatoes.  Both dishes were delicious!  We also appreciated the great blues music playing in the background.  We'll definitely go back many times!
