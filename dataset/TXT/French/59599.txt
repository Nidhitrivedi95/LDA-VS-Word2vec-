The service was good and happy it was crowded. Hopefully service will be equally great when it does get busy. 

We had little fish for starters. It was delicious, not greasy, the greens that came with it were complementing it very nicely. I prefer this over the fried snacks at Hoof Raw bar, those were just way too greasy compared t this.

 The lobster kale salad was yummy. The peaches that came with the salad could be better. I don't know how, it was plated nicely, just it wasn't ripe enough? or it could use a bit of light dressing to tie into it more so? 

Dessert, cookie plate - skip it. Cholocate cake was better, but not a must. I wish spent more on decor or at least drywall the ceiling. If it weren't for the dim lighting, I might have walked out on this place. 

Enjoyable, but it doesn't make me want to go back right away.
