E9HkUYYO_-5vKjvBwLuDIw One of my favorite new finds...Right next door to a Starbucks! I've been hearing about this place for quite some time now and as French bistros go it really is top-notch ! My friends and I had an excellent lunch there they had already been there previously for dinner and were raving about it! Very reasonable prices and a great wine selection.
