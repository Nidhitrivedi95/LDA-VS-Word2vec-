LtDYRcMJbJPhXPEklT29Fw Edwin's is a treasure. Celebrated mom's birthday here tonight. Gerald was fantastic as a waiter. We wish him well as a chef in the coming weeks. Our Grouper was superb (we all ordered it based on Gerald's recommendation). The cheese selection is beyond anything this side of the Atlantic Ocean!! Bananas Foster made table side was a spectacular end to a delicious meal. The details from the setting, the music, the attention to diners... all intentional to the dining experience was appreciated!! Good luck to all in this endeavor. I hope more follow this lead.
