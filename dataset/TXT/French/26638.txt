D87tFO-R6U8f4-e0r4Zq_g Very tiny place with even smaller crepes! The waitress was very nice but the place was not organized at all. Also the lady making the crepes was a bit rude to my friend, he was ordering 2 crepes and she refused to take the order saying that it is too much and he wouldn't be able to finish it! Even after he said he really wanted both crepes she kept telling him to pick one because she would not make both for just him? 
We finally insisted that she makes them and lied saying the other crepe was for a friend. 
Yeah my friend ended up eating both of them in the 15min walk home and was STILL hungry. I had 1 crepe with nutella and strawberries [with barely any strawberries in them] and it was tiny and barely filling. Definitely not worth the $8 it cost. Maybe as a dessert after a meal but certainly not brunch worthy in my book.
