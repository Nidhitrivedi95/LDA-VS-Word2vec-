3jKUbhGSjFTv5jZ0wnW0xA pretty good here! very small and romantic. near all the fun places in the city.  their escargots, hanger steak, beef tartare, and french onion soup is really good.  MUST ORDER THE FRENCH ONION SOUP. its sweet, and not salty at all.  usually french onion soups could be really salty, but their is perfectly seasoned, and the onions are more on the sweeter side. the croutons/bread in it were cripsy, but perfectly soaked in the center.

recommend making a reservation.  the place is 3 stories, and the stairs and the seating area are a bit tight.
