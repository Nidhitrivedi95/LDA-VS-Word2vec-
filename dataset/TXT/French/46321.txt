n4uDGwRGtJ3vW2Adbha_wg We had a large group (18 people) birthday dinner here while visiting Montreal in mid January. I had worked with the staff (Marie) via email and phone to plan the meal which was prix fixe ($45 CAN) for app, entree, and dessert. They were very responsive and cooperative in planning everything. We got a long table near the open kitchen and it was a really cool space. There were a few tables nearby but we were mostly in a section alone which was great. The decor was modern and elegant. 

They agreed to print a special happy birthday message on the menus for the table as well. The food was excellent and the service was great. No one rushed us at all. I think we actually were there a total of 4 hours! Given the great exchange rate for USD right now in Canada, the overall cost per person for dinner was extremely reasonable. And they agreed to print separate checks! This is the most annoying part of group dinners and they made it so simple which was awesome! 

At the very end, we wanted some group photos and the server graciously offered to take them, she even was directing us to make sure everyone was in the shot. 

Overall, I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND this restaurant, especially if you have a large group for a special occasion!
