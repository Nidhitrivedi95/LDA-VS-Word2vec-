hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA It was my first time visiting Baguette Cafe today. It is a little bit hard to find as you can see the sign from the 215 going west,so you have to actually exit durango and make a right on sunset. It is located at the end of some office buildings. You can also access it from the frontage road and make a right. The owner,Olivier is very charming and will recommend you what to have if you are unsure. I had a Cafe Mocha which was served in a big porcelain cup and was very delicious. They serve Illy cafe which is an excellent espresso. I took Olivier's suggestion and ordered the chicken curry sandwich.I asked for it to be a little bit spicy. I was not disappointed at all as the sandwich turned out to be one of the best chicken currys i've had. I would recommend you sit outside if the weather permits. 

Overall great experience,great staff,excellent food and drink selection!
