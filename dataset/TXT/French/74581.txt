xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g We stopped in for a drink while wondering around the strip.  Its probably a lot better to eat here then to come sit at the bar.  The tables are situated by the windows to give an amazing view, but the view from the bar isn't as good.  The service was really good.  The drinks were good but expensive.  I would come back in the evening for dinner as good view of the fountains could definitely make it worth it.
