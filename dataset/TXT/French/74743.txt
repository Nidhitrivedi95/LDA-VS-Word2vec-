xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g My boyfriend and I came here on Valentine's Day. 
We were accompanied up the restaurant by their front guard. The kitchen view is what greets the guests once the elevator opens.  

We were led to the check in counter inside. We were 15 minutes early despite the traffic that day. We waited to be seated at the bar. We both ordered Nitron beer and watched the cool bar tenders mix drinks. 

At exactly 4:45pm, the usher led us to the booth near the bar where our backs would be turned away from the Strip View which we requested upon making the reservation. We understood though that the area was still occupied by guests who were there earlier and haven't finished dining. The lady brought us to an elevated portion of the restaurant that was farthest from the window that they thought had a better view. The area felt like we're outcast so we looked around and checked out the available tables.  We chose the one almost at the center of the restaurant it was a great spot. We had plenty of room around us.

Our waitress was excellent.  She had a great energy in serving and checking on us. We loved all the food except the fish dish. I wished we ordered two steaks instead for the main course. The first time I stood to use the restroom, a waiter escorted me. And when I came back, I got a new table napkin. They changed it like 3 times as many as my trips to the restroom.  It's the 2 bottles of beer and 2 glasses of water! 

We took our time eating and enjoying the $480 dinner plus tip. Overall, the service was excellent and for a romantic evening like that, I would say it was worth it. 

We took home with the table roses and souvenir photo.
