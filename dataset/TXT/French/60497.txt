SBnpT6JDbah-5l_52GM5sw Food quality was OK, but The dishes are over priced. The service was mediocre; you would expect much better service for the price you pay. Looks like they don't put much effort in their dessert and coffee; they just focus on main dishes.

The duck confit was supposed to be wam, but was cold and the meat was very dry! I thought duck meat is tender and has fat. My mom had the beef cheeks and she liked it; I tried some; it was good! The lemon tart had an artificial taste: too citrusy and sweet at the sane time; not sure if they made from scratch. The parts with whipped cream was better because it balanced the taste. We also got an appetizer, melted goat cheese and toasted bread which tasted good but was a bit too heavy for an appetizer.

Location wise, the lake view is nice! And the ambience is OK! It was cold inside; so we were cold the whole time. Outside was chilly too, so we couldn't switch our seating area. The server brought ice water, we had to ask her to change to water with no ice. Its good if she asked in advance so wouldn't be a hassle for her.

Don't order coffee at this place, you will be disappointed! My mom ordered coffee and they gave a her cold coffee from a container! She asked the server to change it; the second time it was warm, but not freshly brewed!
