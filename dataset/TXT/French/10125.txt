4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw The steak I had here was probably the best steak I've ever had in my life. It was perfectly and savory. I remember that "Ratatouille" moment, like in the movie, where my brain just release so many endorphins and I went back to a scene from my childhood. This was very nice and had an amazing view of the Vegas Strip. Highly recommended.
