He was smiling and humming to the music while he worked. The lady behind the counter gave us several suggestions based on our requests. We chose the mascarpone and butternut squash ravioli with butter and sage which was delicious! The owner asked a server to bring over a plate of green beans with tomato and garlic sauce (on the house)! She also brought over the plastic silverware as we forgot to grab ours. It was fresh and tasty. The dessert counter looked appealing so I ordered a carrot cake to take home to my husband. It was fantastic! I will come back based on fast and friendly service, flavor and location. There isn't a lot of indoor seating. My only small suggestion is that several tables hadn't yet been cleaned. I guess that's only a testament to how popular they were before we arrived.
