lcTa0q9Wo4wNyLCIgWFRUA Pretty solid food, I had the Tuna Tartare and the French Onion Soup. The French Onion soup was thick, and the cheese was good quality. Has a very nice rich taste, very heavy. The Tuna Tartare was interesting in that you crack a raw quail egg into the tuna, and mix it around. The bread could have been better, and I thought the tuna tartare was a little bit too mild and mashed, good quality but didn't have much flavor. I would only eat here again if I was too tired to venture out of the hotel..
