xeFVRUjxorxjO_qjX8FNdw I came here thinking it was a cafe, but has so many dinner suited options. I was so pleased with the quality of the food that I decided to write my first review on a restaurant. The dishes were all freshly made, and had the perfect amount of seasoning and were served marvelously. This cafe surely provides quality over quantity and I will definitely be back for more! The smoked salmon was to die for. I also really liked the portobello mushrooms with goat cheese.
