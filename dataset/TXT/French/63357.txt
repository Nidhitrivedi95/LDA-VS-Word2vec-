SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA From what I can tell from everyone else's reviews I'm one of the only people not in aw of this place. 
It is nice, really really nice and has the low lighting for ambiance. The type of place where everyone is dressed very nicely.
With that being said our table was so close to the one next to ours I minus well have been on the person next to me's lap. Any conversation between my table and the next could of all been had together. I get it, it's popular but all that romance for what when you have no privacy. Food taste wise, not overly memorable especially for the price. For a date or special occasion I would recommend somewhere with a little more privacy and more memorable food.
