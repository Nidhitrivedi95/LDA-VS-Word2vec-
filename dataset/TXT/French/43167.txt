lQ9VmIWvM6v-rONPkYX8aQ I read somewhere about Chef Alex saying that he wanted Alex to be your favorite French restaurant. To be honest, Alex is one of my top 3 favorite French restaurants. I highly recommend dining here at least once. 

When I called in for reservations, the delightful Wynn customer service rep. took down our information and also noted that we were celebrating an anniversary. I mentioned to her that I had a wonderful chocolate cake a few years back to celebrate the hubby's birthday and was wondering if it would be available again. I have to admit, the information that is saved on the Wynn's customer service database is not only detailed, the staff knows how to use the information. After all, what's the point in saving information when it won't be utilized? Upon our arrival, the staff greeted us and thanked us for returning. I was a bit surprised when they mentioned us dining here for hubby's 40th birthday. Even if they were reading it off the database, it was great to feel remembered. Nice touch - the Alex staff is expertly trained. 

Since we were celebrating years of coupledom, Hubby and I decided to try the tasting menu with the wine pairings, six courses with six different wines - which I have to admit - even for a wine lover as myself - that's a heck of a lot of wine for me to drink ... but, hey, we're celebrating, right? We usually order a bottle of wine to go with our meals, but decided to live dangerously and drink what the sommelier has paired with our meal. Speaking of the sommelier - I forgot his name, but he was once again, very lovely and recalled speaking with us about Napa Valley wines on our last visit.  

Our tasting menu brings back wonderful memories:

- Heirloom Tomato and Octopus Carpaccio with Parlsey Puree, Brioche Croutons and Osetra Caviar
- Butter Poached Maine Lobster with Sweet Corn Custard, Chanterelle Mushrooms and Coral Butter
- Dover Sole with Artichoke Puree, Fresh Black Truffles, Crispy Potato Cake and Lobster Red Wine
- Veal Sweetbreads with Puff Pastry, Swiss Chard, Fresh Plums and Toasted Almonds
- Japanese Wagyu Strip Lion with Pommes Dauphine, Wild Mushrooms and Sauce Bordelaise
- Coconut Tapioca with Tropical Fruit
- Toasted Vanilla Custard with Maple Poached Peaches and Creme Fraiche Ice Creme

Upon ordering our tasting menus, I asked if I could replace the veal sweetbreads with something else ... our server graciously accommodated my fussiness and allowed me to have the foie gras on the regular menu. 

The star of the meal was the lobster with sweet corn custard. Oh my gawd! This dish gave me an foodgasm that had my toes curled and eyes rolling to the back of my head. It was paired with white wine from Camp Four Vineyard that amazingly augmented the dish into the heavens above. Alas, I cried, can it get any better than this? I know wine and food go hand in hand, but never in my life had I experienced such a wonderfully exquisite moment that left me speechless. Hubby joked with one of our lovely servers, Ryder, asking for more lobster. He was joking, of course, but if more were available, we would have definitely jumped on the opportunity. 

The foie gras dish was sublime. It was paired with a sweet Greek white wine that cut through the rich fattiness of the dish and cleansed my palate in preparation for the next exquisite bite.  

I was extremely tickled when our server brought out the mini chocolate cake that I had fallen in love with on our first visit. What a beautiful way to end such a lovely evening. 

Alex isn't cheap - almost $300/per person for the tasting menu with wines, so save it for when you have something to celebrate. But seriously, this level of food, wine and service is worth it. You're paying for an experience, not just a meal. Great food, awesome wines, beautiful decor, and excellent, well-trained staff make Alex a great destination point that you have to experience - at least once or twice in a lifetime.
