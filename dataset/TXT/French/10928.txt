4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Ate here with the boys on our trip to Vegas last weekend. Changed our 7pm reservation to 8:30 with no trouble (via Open Table). Waited at the bar for less then 2-3 minutes while they prepped our table. For the price, the food was unreal. Us Kansas boys know a good steak when we see it, and the filet & hanger cuts we ordered were cooked perfectly (love that merlot butter too!) and were the perfect portion. Waitress was very friendly & helpful with wine & appetizer suggestions. Were there around 2 hours total, and were never given the feeling of us needing to be rushed out of there. Highly recommended! Great date or group spot for dinner.
