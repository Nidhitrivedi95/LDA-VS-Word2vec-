SCklYa_jhihWAcfIn-_chg I got dragged here and didn't expect to enjoy it since it isn't my kind of food but it ended up being delicious. I didn't have a bad experience with the waiter but it definitely seems like no one there enjoys their job. It doesn't surprise me that there's so many negative reviews about the service.
