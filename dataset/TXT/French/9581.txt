They served this amazing bread with pickled olive dish as I sat down which made me instantaneously happy.   Vegas tends to do that: they make you instantaneously happy or sad...and instantaneously broke (rarely rich).   

Fries were unique and I really loved it (pretty addicting).  My ribeye was cooked more like a medium than medium rare and though it wasn't the best ribeye, it was good enough.

not worth mentioning: not-so-great oysters and descent spinach/garlic dish .  Wait...I feel like I forget to mention something.  Oh yea, please treat yourself with their French Onion Soup and the white bread pudding!

Wait can be long.  Make sure to have reservations.
