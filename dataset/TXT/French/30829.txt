fyJAqmweGm8VXnpU4CWGNw My husband and I came here recently on a rainy day and were pleasantly surprised. The inside is cute and quaint. Half of it is like a grocery with a large selection of beers/wines, some small goods, and a cheese counter. The other half is a bar, a pastry counter, and a place to order food/drinks. Tables are sprinkled in-between both sections making the place flow.  Since it was after lunch, we looked at the pastry display case and drooled over the delicious looking cakes, tarts, and other goodies. The menu board had a few specials of the day and announced fresh, made to-order beignets. Our decision made, we ordered beignets and two vanilla lattes. The lattes came out first and were delicious. The espresso was strong and flavorful, not bitter at all. The vanilla was sweet but not overpowering. (The lattes were so good, I ordered another before we left.) Shortly after the lattes were delivered, the beignets followed and were huge, hot, sugary puffs of deliciousness. Three beignets come to an order and they were very filling. I would definitely come back for the beignets and I would love to come back and try some of their other items.
