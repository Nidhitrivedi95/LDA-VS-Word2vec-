i5vxtyiHKYnRcJ0p9N7mLw Went for the first time yesterday. The door was not half-way shut before I was given a friendly welcome by Carlo. I was shown the special and soup of the day, but I came in with my mind set on a chicken parm sandwich. I ordered it with Carlo's bread. The size and quality were both well worth the $9 for the sandwich. Everything about it was super-yummy: great breading, chicken was good texture, sauce was flavorful but not so thick as to mask the flavor of the chicken. It was also obvious that the Carlo's bread had been made fresh that morning. LOL the only downside is the sandwich was so good, it may discourage me from trying the other things on the menu.
