UxWH8zRYIBgs6Q2oykvRdw After roaming around during our visit to the Toronto Christmas Market we decided to go  eat at Cluny.

This is our second time to come to this place and honestly I like the food better the first time we were here.

We noticed they have also changed  the menu and increased the price but the quality of the food is now lacking.

They still offer you the freshly baked bread with butter but that's the only thing I enjoyed. We also ordered Cocktails - Bulldog Francais & Mojitos but there's nothing spectacular about it.

For food, we ordered a small Cheeseboard, Cluny Caesar salad and Coq Au Vin Poutine - all mediocre!  The Coq Au Vin has more fries than braised chicken and for $18.95 this is pricey.

I have recommended this restaurant to families and friends before but after dining tonight I don't think i will be doing the same thing.
