D7CnTsm8SCmbQghz1ioPdw Happened upon this place by chance and what a treat!! Everything was perfect and is hands down the best place I've been.

The decor is perfect, raw stone and wood, and although not large the place could accommodate quite a few larger tables without disturbing those wanting a more intimate setting.

After some good cocktails we began with the duck smoked meat and for mains had the venison chop and boar shoulder.  Everything was perfectly proportioned to ensure most normal people could make it to dessert...which we had the bruele.  The meat was sensational, great mild seasoning and sides so you could still taste the fantastic cuts of veal and pig.

Service was perfect as well, personable & knowledgeable.

Will definitely be heading back to this place next time I'm in Montreal...and there are a ton of good places already, but this beats them.
