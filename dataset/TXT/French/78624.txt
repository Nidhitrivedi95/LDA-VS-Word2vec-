ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug bad service, the only smile I get here is when I'm going to pay. and once I say I don't like the service at all, one of the waitress turned to a cold face again. the food is just so so. but the attitude is so bad that I'd rather you guys who are looking for even a quick bite avoid this place.
