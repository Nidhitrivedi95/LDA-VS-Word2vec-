rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A We were with a group of people who were guests of the Executive Chef. Mark Hopper. Let me say this was probably one of the best dining experiences I have ever had. I have eaten all over the US and in MANY countries throughout the world...WOW. Mark took great care of our table and later in the evening came out to talk to the table. He shook hands with everyone at the table and thanked each of us personally for coming. He was genuinely charming and enthusiastic about his rest. and food creations. We had corn soup with currants and chive oil, figs with pepper gastrique and sweet peppers, oysters on the 1/2 shell, endive salad with sweetened nuts, a mushroom filled ravioli, fillet, the pork special, dark chocolate moouse and mint chip ice cream. I am obviously not describing the food to do it any justice....Sorry Mark. Everything was BEYOND DELICIOUS. The flavor of the mint chip ice cream was like sipping fresh mint tea...so refreshing. If I could Yelp more than 5 stars I would. I will probably never yelp 5 stars again after this meal.
