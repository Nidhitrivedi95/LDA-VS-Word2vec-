SCklYa_jhihWAcfIn-_chg To be clear i only came there to test their croissants as i am still searching for the 'best croissant in Toronto.'

Theirs are tasty and quite buttery.  Unfortunately, the inside--although chewy as needed--is not light and fluffy as though it were slightly undercooked.  
Cakes and quiches look interesting although ranging in the standard fare in terms of choice.

Would i go back?   If I'm in the neighbourhood, looking for croissants, thats probably the place I'd go to as others nearby are terrible.
