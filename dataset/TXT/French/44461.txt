ME6D5nLlfG0xZCtICOYDuw I met a business associate for a very nice dinner. The staff were responsive to our needs and very personal-able. I had asked for a more private location to enable our business discussions. The staff accommodated my request, found us a nice private table, and continue to cater to our needs. The food was excellent. I would highly recommend George's.
