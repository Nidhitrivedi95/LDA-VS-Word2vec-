8ciT6qjI18x9EPtOb-gqYQ After reading all the reviews, I have to say I was not all that impressed.
I am from NYC and lived in Los Angeles, so I am always looking for real food experiences here in Phx. This fell short.
The positives:
Servers were attentive
Dining room was clean
The onion tart was great- but NOT worth $12!
The negatives:
Mediocre lunch menu
Moroccan lamb sandwich - other than the chutney and the natural gaminess of the lamb, the sandwich had no flavor. 
Pomme frites- overdone potato wedges I can make at home
Onion tart- as stated above, not at all worth $12 for a slice of quiche. $6, maybe $7. But $12?!! The crust was too sweet. 
My friends had the ham and Brie, sliders, and salmon tacos. All were mediocre tasting and unimpressive. Shocking that all are so expensive.
Lemon tart dessert- gross. Pale custard looked like vomit in a small crust. Again flavor was not impressive. 
So perhaps this place is great for dinner, and I may come back to try that- but for lunch, no way.
