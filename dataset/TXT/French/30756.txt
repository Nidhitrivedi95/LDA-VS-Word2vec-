fyJAqmweGm8VXnpU4CWGNw It took me a while to finally try French Grocery, and overall I'm glad I did. 
We were here during dinner and were right away confused by the concept. My boyfriend and I weren't greeted or told to seat ourselves, the staff didn't seem to notice us at all. Once we were seated, the server seemed rushed and frustrated. 

We ordered French onion soup to start, Steak Frites, mussels, and an IPA from the grab-n-go fridge. All of the good was super delicious, no complaints whatsoever. 

Bottom line, the only thing keeping this from being a 4 or 5 star review is the service. They may have better luck with a fast-casual format, easier for the customer to understand and the staff wouldn't have to be juggling kitchen and serving duties simultaneously. But we'll be back for the food.
