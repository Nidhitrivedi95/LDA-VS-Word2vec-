Located inside Paris and across the street from the Bellagio, it offers one of the best views of the fountain show and is a fantastic place to people watch. Even as the crisp winter air approaches Las Vegas, there is no excuse to not dine al fresco as the million heat lamps are out in full force.

I made a reservation through open table for 815pm on Saturday and had no trouble changing it last minute when I realized there was no way I was going to make it. I love technology. Made another reservation for 9 and waited an extra 10 minutes (aka .53783 second in Vegas time) for patio seating. 

I ordered the salmon and my friend ordered the steak merlot and daaaaaaaaaaaaaaamn I'm hooked. The food came out perfect and I was practically drooling by the time it was in front of me. The salmon was flaky, hot, and the bed of quinoa was just the right consistency, something a lot of restaurants can't seem to manage.
