Nf9YGbWIwNMEv41J52g3tQ My mom and I met here for lunch when she was in the area for work, it was a great Yelp moment since she'd had a mediocre lunch the day before and was delighted to discover this tiny spot tucked right around the corner from her workshop. It was cozy, there was even a lovely fireplace (though not a real wood one.) The service was incredibly warm and friendly and the lunch specials were affordable and tasty. I loved the cream of vegetable soup, especially the presentation in the jar with the tasty scoops of cream on top, and my smoked meat pastry lunch done tarte tatin style was super good. My mom had a hot healing stew that didn't change her life but I think made her pretty happy. I'd come back here for lunch when in the area for sure.

One thing - they had a vintage poster on the wall with a caricature of an African man eating a banana that made me kind of uncomfortable, seemed fairly racist to me, though I wouldn't be the right person to fully determine that. I just know that it didn't seem right.
