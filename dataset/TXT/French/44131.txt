MdjIl105vqCYUGKFSUVytA Came here with my girlfriend for the sunday brunch. The food was spectacular! It's an all-you-can-eat style buffet, yet one with the freshest food. As they are pretty busy, food gets demolished and replenished timely. 

They did a roast (beef?) and salmon wellington, it was delicious, and the amazing staff was able to cut me a small sliver as requested so I can sample more of their food (which i really appreciate)! 

They offer a crab leg seafood salad, probably one of my favourite items they offer.
