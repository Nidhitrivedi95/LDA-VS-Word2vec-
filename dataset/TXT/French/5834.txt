3OCooCzHgsS2xHdN-dNVXg Disclaimer: This was a tough choice between 2 and 3 stars for me, but because the food WAS actually delicious; I opted for the 3.

La Maquette is a place I've been wanting to go to since I started at GBC, since it's just a short walk from the college and has so many awards for "most romantic restaurant in the city" on display. It seemed like the perfect opportunity to go when a Groupon-like deal came up in 2010...

Fast forward to 2014 when I found the deal I had printed, noted that there was no expiry and made a reservation ASAP.

When I made the reservation I noted that we wouldn't be ordering off of the Winterlicious menu because we had the deal; they assured us it would be no problem. When we arrived, I again mentioned that we would like the full menu; the staff were very concerned and had to speak to the kitchen about what was actually available. It turns out the thing I wanted (quail) was not, but with a heavy heart I searched the menu for an alternative. We ended up with an appetizer (which of course I can't remember), and mains of salmon and bacon-wrapped scallops. 

All the food was absolutely delicious; though it did take absolutely forever to come out. I wish they had told us it would be hard to accommodate orders off the regular menu; we could have easily come another time. 

So keeping our delicious food in mind; here are the drawbacks (some are nit-picky, I can't help it):

- Decor: this place looks like it was probably the most romantic spot ever in the early 90s, and the decor hasn't been updated since. It's so olllllllld. Why are there so many china cabinets? It's weird. Your table cloths are yellow. Update. 
- Service: certainly sub-par. It was slow, they never came by refill water unless we flagged them down; and they all had an annoyed look on their face
- Set-up: we happened to be sitting in the sweet-spot downstairs where you can hear the main floor live musician AND the upstairs musician - an acoustically strange experience 
- Water jug: I already mentioned that they didn't come by to fill up water; but when they did, the water was in one of those plastic beer pitchers. It just doesn't fit! 


So overall, what do I think? I think if I wanted to go somewhere nice with my grandparents I would suggest La Maquette. But otherwise, there is too much else to experience in the city for me to come back any time soon.
