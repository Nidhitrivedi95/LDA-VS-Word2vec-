cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg This place is ridiculous in the best way possible.  It's so rich and filling, I could barely eat the next day.  I could have totally sufficed with the appetizers, which were an incredibly good duck carpaccio and venison tartare in some insane Japanese presentation.  Both were very rich and rich in flavor.  The foie gras was excellently prepared, and the main taken "Pied de Cochon", aka pigs foot, was enough to feed at least 6 people, comfortably.  It came in a sauce that reminded me of extra good French onion soup.  The desert which was a dense white cake in an extra tasty maple caramel pudding was fantastically decadent.  I could not believe I could actually eat it, but it was so fantastic, I could not stop eating it.  This place is a true experience.  A mix between Quebecois and Decadent French food.
