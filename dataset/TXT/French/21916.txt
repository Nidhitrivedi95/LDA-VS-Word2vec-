bMiyGPaMqF0svjseW1UR_g Had a late dinner on a Wednesday night after arriving from Montreal.  This restaurant is a 10-minute walk from the Intercontinental Montreal through quaint and safe streets.

The ambience is awesome-- little French bistro, and pretty full even for a Wednesday night at 9 pm.  I started with a glass of rose, very refreshing, then onto a salade Lyonnaise with bitter frisee, lardons, and a poached egg.  There was WAY too much of the lardons on the salad, but be it far from me to complain about an excessive amount of crispy, smoked, fried meat. . .  Besides this, it was delicious with a runny egg and sharp vinaigrette.  I ended with the most delightful little cake with a maple cream sauce.  It came with the de rigeur but superfluous half-ripe slices strawberry and mint leaf, but I forgive them for the trite garnish.  I'm still thinking about that maple cream sauce.

Overall, a wonderful little gem for good-- not great-- food that hits the spot when you need a fix of old-world charm and classic French bistro fare.
