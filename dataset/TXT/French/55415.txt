rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A It's not good to go to a restaurant hung over.  It really destroys the experience and affects one's choice of food.  

I should have gotten so many things but I opted for the omelette (the choice that day was garden veggie) with sausage.  The omelette was just fine though the veggies were tasty.  It just didn't have enough of the veggies.  And the sausage was weird. I'm pretty sure it wasn't pork.  The best thing about my breakfast was the light and airy toast.  

My friend's sourdough waffles were fantastic.  And my other friend's scallops were pretty decent.  I had serious food envy.

Service is WAY TOO SLOW.  But I'd probably go back for dinner when I'm not in so much of a rush.  We were there for almost two hours and I spent the time wondering why the host's pants were too short and what drugs our server was on.
