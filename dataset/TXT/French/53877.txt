qnFdBp12seAxwe2_iHM2bA My partner and I went here on Saturday night based on the Yelp reviews.  We were somewhat disappointed.  

While nothing was horrible, it was certainly not outstanding.  We had escargot for an appetizer.  It was just okay.  Maybe it was a bit chewier than others I had.  

For the main course I had the Duck Confit.  It was decent, but nothing exciting.  Potatoes were alright.

My partner had the Filet Mignon,.  It was cooked to his liking, but it was a bit tough.  It should cut like butte, but it was a bit hard to cut.

I would maybe consider coming back, but my partner would definately not want to go back to this one.
