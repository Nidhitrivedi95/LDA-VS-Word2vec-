BSmqxPbQglQwP2R56OqOag We saw Local Bistro in the neighborhood and thought it looked inviting so we booked a reservation for dinner. The bar and restaurant were full of people and the atmosphere was lively.  We shared a Greek salad which was a great portion for a starter; the flavors were fresh and worked well together. We ordered wild salmon and substituted the saffron risotto. The food definitely deserved 4 stars very tasty but not exceptional. The service was excellent from our waiter, Ryan. Several of the management staff came by to thank us for coming to the restaurant and also brought a complementary dessert which was very good as well. Our only complaint (although hardly worth mentioning) was the very small bit of bread to be shared between two people. All in all we would definitely come back and enjoyed our experience.
