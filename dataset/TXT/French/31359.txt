gh6__q2WXFuyN8gt6VAnWw found this nice little Portuguese restaurant and the food was delicious tried the soup it was a large bowl of Caldo Verde ( Potato, kale & Chlorizo )  Then I had the seafood Pasta , It had Plenty of calamari, A couple of nice chunks of Lobster, some Mussels & Clams in a cream sauce  with a couple of cans of soda & the price was under $30. the food was not cheap but it was delicious with large portions well worth the price. & Luby the owner was very nice will be coming back again.
