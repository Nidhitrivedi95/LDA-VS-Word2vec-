mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q I was excited to finally try food from one of Joel Robuchon's restaurants. And while I thoroughly enjoyed it and felt it was worth the money, I will probably spend the extra to go next door if I have the opportunity.

The atmosphere is pretty interesting. The dining area is quiet and dark, but from the bar you look from your shadowy seats directly into the bright kitchen where all the action is happening. 

We did one seasonal menu and one menu B. Just enough food for two people. 

Their mashed potatoes (duh) and duck are AMAZING. These were my two favorite items of the night. I've heard that in the mashed potatoes recipe, the ratio of potatoes to butter is 1:1 so of course it's heaven in your mouth. 

The duck was perfectly medium, juicy, tender, just the right amount of salty, and so flavorful. It was cooked so perfectly that when it came out I thought it was steak. I'm not a huge duck fan. I am a steak girl all the way, but this duck has forced me to reevaluate my past misconceptions about the bird. 

Other items were good, but I wouldn't necessarily go back for them.
