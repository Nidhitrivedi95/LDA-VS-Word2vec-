My boyfriend and I recently just went here to celebrate our two year anniversary and I'm really glad he picked this place. Great steak and a huge selection of wines, What more can you ask for? 

We both got the steak frites which was so delicious. A 4oz steak piled high with caramelized onions. Aka foodie heaven. He got the red pepper soup to start and I got the salad. Both were pretty good and left us feeling quite full at the end of the dinner. 

The service was also really great. Everyone there was very friendly and helpful. Over all it was a great night out. Woo anniversaries!
