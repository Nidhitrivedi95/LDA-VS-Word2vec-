rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A This is a review for Sunday Brunch:  I really hate to give another review from my Las Vegas trip low stars, but they really deserve it. 

Upon arrival we were asked to wait 10-15 minutes for a table.  I enjoyed the space and the service/ cappuccino at the marble bar. (Moving forward I would recommend this portion for drinks only!) However, while we were at the bar, no one ever came to inform us of our table. My bf asked the host and there was no record of our name!  

When we were finally seated, we ordered two breakfast entrees and a beignet starter( i was envisioning tasty puffs with powder sugar- like new orleans). The "doughnuts" were an inch round, undercooked and there were 3 on tiny plate for $8! boo.  When the meals arrived our table was still packed with plates and appetizer mess.....which was originally ignored and forced onto our cluttered table anyways.  It wasn't until I spoke up and pointed that we had no room to eat, that any of the wait staff saw it necessary to remove anything.  The food was very bland and unimpressive once we dug in- I had the boring waffles that sound fancy with vanilla bean butter, and my BF had the croque madam with is really just a plate of french fries and a burnt sandwich covered up with a salty bernaisse. 

I really feel like a tool for picking this restaurant as I have been a fan of Thomas Keller for quite some time. The one thing this place does have in common with a French Bistro is the snobby 'tude and "our food is the best in the world" mentality, when it clearly is not.
