mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q Good, but not great.  I went here based on the reviews and wanted sooooooo much to love the place.  After all, it received a Michelin star... so what could go wrong, right?

Well, several glasses of wine later and several hours later, I tried my best to enjoy their Discovery Menu, but just could not find the "wow" factor I was looking for.  This was back in Spring of 2009, so I will defer to other Yelpers around that time for the details of the tasting menu... and boy do some of them go into detail.

Suffice it to say that I was accompanied by 7 other people that were also not blown away by the food.  Maybe it was a bad night, maybe I just need to realize that my expectations were too high.  

Nevertheless, I must say, the service was fantastic and they did introduce me to unpasteurized French butter... which is phenomenal!  All in all, I probably wouldn't go back. After all, there are so many other places to go in Vegas.
