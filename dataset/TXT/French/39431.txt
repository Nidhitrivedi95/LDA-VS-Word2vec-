jSfnItqaOnEp2nenVF7fCg It was a Saturday lunch, the place was packed.  We grabbed the only available table outside.  One older waitress explains to us the BYOB policy when we asked for the wine list. Then she says "I take it you have never been here before?"  *walks off giggling*  One of my girlfriend walks to a pharmacy near by (recommended by old  waitress), and when she returned with 2 bottles of wine our new waitress tells us "Oh, well, you can't drink that on the patio!"  After some disucssion, and our new waitress going inside to talk to the manager, they allowed us to drink but said it would only be this one time.  Later other patrons next to us began complaining where we could hear them "Why do THEY get to drink on the patio?"  Needless to say it was a VERY unpleasant experience, and I will not be returning.  From now on I will happily drive to downtown PHX from Surprise to meet my girlfriends for lunch where I know where to find this same quality of food but far superior customer service.
