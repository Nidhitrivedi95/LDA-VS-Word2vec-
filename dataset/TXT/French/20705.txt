Review is strictly for the French Macarons.

My BF purchased me a box of 12 for $30.  A little on the pricey end and I was fairly satisfied.  The box came with the following flavors:

Passion Fruit - Pretty good but not into Passion Fruit
Lemon - Yuck, I didn't take a second bite
Coffee - My favorite one out of the bunch
Strawberry - Super yummy and my other favorite
Vanilla - Yummy too!
Blueberry - OK but nothing to rave about

The texture is actually what I"m looking for.  The outside shell of the macaron was good; light flaky crisp cookie.  But when biting into it I was expecting a chewy, fudgy center, but instead, it was cake like.

Good taste, but I expect a better texture. I'm in a hunt for the best macarons in Vegas :)
