Bf-yMQiSmDZyqfGyFKQ0bA Finally made it to this gem by the Waterfront - formerly known as a culinary wasteland of chain restaurants and long lines. After a soul-crushing time slogging through the Waterfront parking lots, this watering hole on the other side of the tracks is an oasis with its plentiful good beers on tap. I was surprised by the lack of burgers, but if you're in the mood for a meaty sandwich the brisket sandwich was devoured by our neighbor at the bar. We opted for the nachos and pork tacos for an abundance of good bar food with a highlight of clearly home-made salsa. The name of the game at Blue Dust is "home-made" with their jars of treats sprinkled around the bar from cherry peppers stuffed with cheese and soppressata to bacon-infused vodka. 

The atmosphere is bright and clean - with lots of windows and plants - not common for a bar. The bartender's laid-back joking attitude dressed in a floral Hawaiian shirt really set the tone. The crowd for a Saturday lunch was a friendly mix of regulars from all walks of life and ages. Overall, this is a great little neighborhood spot in a struggling neighborhood.
