rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw EXCEPTIONAL from start to finish this restaurant did not disappoint. Went there for weekend brunch, staff was very friendly and the ambiance is just beautiful. Peach Bellini was perfect, warm baguette with butter to start was delicious. We ordered the Nutella sticky bun which was outstanding and not overly sweet. The roasted hazelnuts on top were a tasty crunch. My wife had steak and eggs and I had the lobster scramble. Both dishes were excellent. I was surprised with the quantify and quality of the lobster - no skimping here. Plus the light touch of caviar on top really set this dish apart. Highly recommend this place! We also ate at another French restaurant (not to be named) but in the vicinity across from the bellagio hotel. It was also very good, but the Bardot is in another league.
