ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug Walking through the Paris Hotel, you can't miss this Parisian style street cafe with its large "outside" patio dining.

There was no wait when we walked in for lunch and we were sat quickly.  The decor is cute and if you don't pay attention to the nearby sounds of slot machines, you might feel like you're in France.

I had the Soup/ Sandwich combo ($17) with French onion soup and half a turkey croissant sandwich.  This hit the spot. The soup was tasty and had that perfect gooey cheese/bread on top. The croissant sandwich was fresh and the applewood bacon made the sandwich that much better.

Our server, Dennis, was the icing on the cake. He was incredibly friendly from start to finish and continuously checked up on us throughout our meal.  He reminded of a cool grandpa who would pull a coin out from behind your ear.  I would come back just to say hi to him.
