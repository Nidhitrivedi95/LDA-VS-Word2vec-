USleI8g1UVN9-9jm-b4uIg If you're in Charlotte, go here. Seriously, dismiss the objection that just bubbled up in your mind, and go here. Amazing food and great service. When something didn't come out quite right, they fixed it, let us enjoy our meal, and then proceeded to comp THE ENTIRE MEAL. The elk chop was hearty and delightfully tender, and the chocolate and graham tart was the perfect size and was composed perfectly. Highest recommendation.
