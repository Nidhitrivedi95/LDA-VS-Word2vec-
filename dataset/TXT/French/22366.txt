BSmqxPbQglQwP2R56OqOag Love this place! My family had dinner there right before Christmas and the food and service was outstanding! From our cocktails to after dinner drinks, our evening was extremely enjoyable! Our evening began with our waiter, Jonathan who was so knowledgeable and could not have been more accommodating. He really made our evening so much more fun! Lots of excellent suggestions and we loved all of it! Would definitely go to Local Bistro again very soon  and request Jonathan!
