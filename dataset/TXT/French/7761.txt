My only two complaints are that my steak entree came with steak frites but when I inquired about that when ordering, I was told that everything was al la carte. Additionally, the steak was butterflied to my surprise. I'd always rather be told if my steak is going to be butterflied... Sometimes I will change my order when knowing that. But, the Roquefort was delicious none the less.
