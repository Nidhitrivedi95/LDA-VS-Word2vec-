Having said that, it is not a romantic place- the tables are set too close together, it is a very loud place and the menu choices are very limited and rigid.
This establishment requires reservation and we got a table at 9:30 pm. I hate going to restaurants after 8pm as the servers seem to be exhausted and over worked and it seems like a task to ask them questions about the menu or wine! Plus the best desserts are sold out!!
Anyhow, we were there- shown to our table which was soo close to 2 other tables. We had 3 servers- one to take our order, another to serve and refill bread, butter and pickles ! And another one to get our food. 
There are not many vegetarian or chicken based options here. So we ordered a spaghetti, a soup and a thai cauliflower dish. Lets say, we were hungry and the food was hot and the wine was good!
I have had better food at other places in Montreal and this place just did not cut for me, inspite of all the hoopla!
