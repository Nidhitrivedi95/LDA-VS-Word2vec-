rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I come here every time I visit Vegas.  The food here is incredible. Every time we spend a while here, enjoying a number of courses.  

For brunch I had the Chicken & Waffles.  Every part of this is delicious in it's own right, and then also amazing combined.  

For dinner I had a series of appetizers and the Gigot d'Agneau (Lamb).  I can't remember this one so well, but I recall that I was very pleased.
