rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Bouchon is located on the 10th floor of the Venezia Tower so just go up from the Guest Elevators and go across the walkway! The restaurant is right next to the beautiful garden and pool area. The interior design of the restaurant is really pretty and definitely a romantic ambiance for a date!

They don't do reservations for lunch so our wait time on a Sunday was about 20 minutes, which isn't too bad. Plus, they have free pastries out to nibble on while you wait. 

My boyfriend and I got 1 pastry and 2 entrees and we were stuffed by the end! 
- Beignets du Jour ($8): These were made perfectly! Crispy on the outside, super soft on the inside, topped with cinnamon and powdered sugar. You can dip these with their homemade strawberry jam or chocolate. Just thinking about this makes my mouth water! Seriously so delicious. 
- Chicken and Waffles ($27): The chicken is roasted, unlike the usual fried chicken from Roscoe's x) This is their most famous dish. My boyfriend said it was just regular roasted chicken but I appreciated that they didn't make it dry. We both really liked the brown Chasseur sauce it came with - it really made the chicken more tasty! The waffles were really good as well but I usually get tired of eating any waffle after a while.
- Croque Madame ($19): This was the first time we've tried this dish and we both loved it! The only complaint was that we wished the sandwich was bigger!! It was super delicious. My boyfriend usually hates cheese but he loved this dish because all the flavors and ingredients blended in really well. The ham was really great quality too. Definitely recommend this dish - it ain't no regular sandwich! It also comes with A LOT of fries - wish they could use some of that space to give us more of the sandwich :p

I would rate my experience 4.5/5. I had no complaints with the service or food except that I want more of their beignets! My only gripe is the price - it's a bit expensive ): but definitely not as ridiculous as other restaurants in Vegas! The ambiance and quality of the food make up for the price though!
