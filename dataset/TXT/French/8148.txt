4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Such a lovely visit!   Have been in the past and finally got back on this visit to town.   Thank you to Debbie for making our anniversary lunch special with a comped dessert and candle!!!   The food was wonderful - the bread so good (!), the service was great and it was a busy afternoon - and the outdoor setting was just what we were looking for that day.   We will be returning again!
