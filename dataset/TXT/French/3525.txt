1LELXxqe2IM2opJbi4dcaA Just ordered from this place, it took over an hour for the food to be delivered. the food was cold and my drink was warm. very upsetting for the price, my friend asked for an iced tea but got a sprite. i got the tandoori sandwich, it was decent, but the fries were soggy and cold. i will not be ordering from here again.
