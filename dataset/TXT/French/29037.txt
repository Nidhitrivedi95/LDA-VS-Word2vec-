EPb3FWs3mxQLUjGeMNP0SQ One of the few outdoor rooftop bars in Montreal and is was a hit in my book.  

My wife and I came here with another couple for drinks around 10pm.  We got a great table, ordered a bottle of champagne, and had a great time.  The service was very good from the hosts in the lobby that directed us up, to the hostess on the roof, to our server.  Our server was friendly and attentive.

The music was good and not too loud, the clientele was definitely upscale, but not pretentious in any way.  It was also not too crowded.  

If you are looking for some over the top, LA / Manhattan rooftop craziness experience (we were not) - go somewhere else.  This is purely an upscale chill spot to go before you go somewhere else to get your night started off right.
