oS96aJIHFWcFAlGHKKXjaw Recently had wandered in to pick up some macarons. I did get there late in the day so very few were left (hence only 4 stars), but what they did have were giant (twice the size) raspberry and lychee macarons. They were cooked PEREFCTLY, had a great balance between the sweet lychee cream, raspberry cookie and fresh raspberries in the cream. Tremendously delicious. I highly recommend this French bakery, but suggest not waiting for the afternoon to roll around.
