ucgzkl7atsBMGu4gGpmHfw Great little bistro in Toronto. it's cute and quaint, but seating is a bit scarce, and the hours are a tad limited. We came here for brunch, though, and loved the food. The menu is constantly changing, but this ensures everything is made with fresh and local ingredients, so don't be afraid to be a little adventurous! Just be warned; the place is cash only! This almost caught us when we went here, so be prepared. Overall, however, it's a great little place in Toronto that I recommend.
