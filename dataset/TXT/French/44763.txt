Mqsb3Tzabaq95yQIWTuQtg Glad to see good reviews for this restaurant on here as its little known outside Newington (which is often avoided being considered too studenty). I used to live round the corner from here as a student but found Wild Elephant to have a wide mix of clientèle. It was one of my favourite places for takeaway and the food was always fantastic and reasonably priced
