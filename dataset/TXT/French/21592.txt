bEVWHtBRYVwqaaNF4mWNYg I had the pork belly and Florentine eggs Benedict here. The pork belly was delicious and I recommend it! I've had better eggs florentine as the spinach was a bit overlooked and there wasn't much salmon..the potatoes that came on the side were well season and tasty. The service was great, our waiter was humorous and very friendly!
