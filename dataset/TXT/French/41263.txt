kGOr_D-LNpgZ2M9N8TT4QQ I went on a Wednesday night for drinks / snacks with a buddy to check it out (it's across the street from my house). I wasn't really expecting much since most restros in Yorkville are overpriced / nothing special. In terms being "a scene", the crowd seemed like wealthy Rosedale folk in their late 40s and up. Hopefully younger people pick this place up and it becomes a little more cross-generational. Anyhow, I had a glass of wine (The wine menu is awesome - get McMannis by the glass), Steak Frites (the fries were super skinny and the steak had a slab of butter on top - exactly how I like it!), and the Creme Brulee (i wasn't a dessert person but i think i am now). It was such a great experience (both the food and the service), that my friend is already booking all his clients there and i'm most likely going to head back tonight.
