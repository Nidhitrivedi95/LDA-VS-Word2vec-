Zl6csaZ5HBka3SKBphHXrQ Have been here a few times and each time and more impressed. We've never needed to wait for a table for dinner (probably because baldwin area is busier during lunch hour). The food, wine and prices are fantastic and the service has always been effecient and friendly. Favourites: midi salad, escargot (the four of us were fighting over the last one - and I dont usually even like escargot!!), the MUSSELS (must try - so many good flavours, best I have had in Toronto), cinnamon salmon, beef stew...and the DESSERTS!!!! Must try the apple tart with homemade cinnamon ice cream and the walnut chocolate cake!!!
