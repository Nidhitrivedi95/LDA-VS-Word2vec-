Bf-yMQiSmDZyqfGyFKQ0bA Short version: Cheap, delicious, friendly, unique. Get the crab curry soup.

Longer version: Oh sweet, loving, though possibly non-existent God; this place is unfortunately hidden yet wonderfully comforting. I wish I could try everything. My only option, obviously, is to go back in order to try everything.

I went with a few friends on  Tuesday night after having to go to the Verizon store at the Waterfront and not really wanting to eat at Red Robin (nothing wrong with Red Robin, though). They had 25 cent pierogies on special--obviously, we had 25 of them. They were perfectly browned, crisp on the edges, and after a little searching we managed to find the pile of onions that they were cooked with. The spinach artichoke dip was equally delicious, leading me to have faith in the other appetizers as well.

For our main course, we all ended up splitting crab curry soup, fried zucchini, and the surf'n'turf (half of a crabcake sandwich and half of a house-smoked brisket sandwich). They had a sweet collection of craft beers on tap and the dude who served us was probably the nicest person I've ever met within the food industry. The crab curry soup was simple and exactly the dish I'd go back for.

I can't wait to go back and explore the rest of what Blue Dust has to offer.
