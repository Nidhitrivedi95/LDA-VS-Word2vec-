The service is impeccable - someone greeted us immediately, and the timing throughout the evening was perfect. Our waiter, Guillaume, is clearly a pro who loves what he does, and we had a lovely nerdy conversation about crumbers and the logistics of importing wine.

We went for the 2015 edition of Montréal à Table, which was a slightly reduced price for a three course meal including items already on their menu with one special exception - a mousse de foie de volaille that knocked our socks off. The smoky beets with root chips were also incredible and a surprise: I'm so used to every restaurant serving beets the same way, with goat cheese and acid, but these had an earthiness to them which gave them depth. The duck with risotto was very rich and we enjoyed it, but the Arctic char was a bit of a miss, lacking originality. That said, we probably wouldn't have chosen that particular dish had it not been one of the options for the evening's special.

Dessert knocked our socks off, but we couldn't even finish it. Absolutely must try their Crémant de Jura if you like to start with a glass of bubbly - we loved it and may order a case of it thanks to our server's wealth of knowledge and advice! (Fellow Yelp-ers, feel free to contact me about ordering cases of crémant to share!)
