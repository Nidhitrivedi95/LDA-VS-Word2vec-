kGOr_D-LNpgZ2M9N8TT4QQ I've written two previous reviews for this restaurant, both very positive, and I stand by them for the upstairs/inside restaurant and kitchen. Unfortunately, the high quality of food and service that I've come to expect from this place did not hold in the new patio area, which has a separate menu (and, I assume, kitchen). This review is only for the patio area and menu- I would still highly recommend the food served inside.

It's a shame, because the patio is beautiful, with lots of potential to be the setting for a great dining experience. I ordered the green tea mojito and lobster watermelon salad. The mojito, while tasting nothing of green tea, was very nice, if a little bit sweet for my taste. The salad was a disaster. The lobster was rubbery and tasted... a little off. It had me thinking, "this probably won't poison me, but it tastes like it's been dead a little too long". The nicely shredded cabbage was ruined by a dressing that tasted like lightly watered down mayonnaise. The slice of watermelon, which I was counting on for a fresh hit of fruit, was unfortunately soaked through with the water/mayonnaise horror, and so the salad was left without a single redeeming feature. Strange lobster and bland dressing does not a $24 salad make.

For dessert, I ordered a trio of sample portions: vanilla creme brulee, chocolate something or other, and a mixed berry compote trifle. The creme brulee was very good, the chocolate was fairly good, but the trifle had a strange, almost yeasty tang. I was finished with it after a single bite.

The hostess/waitress/bartender was friendly and pleasant, but seemed very inexperienced. She mixed up my mother's salad order and dessert order, and seemed somewhat bewildered throughout our lunch.

Overall, a disappointing experience at a usually excellent restaurant. I would suggest that you avoid the patio and stick to eating inside.
