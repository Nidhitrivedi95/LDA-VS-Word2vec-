ME6D5nLlfG0xZCtICOYDuw I was very disappointed with my dinner at Georges Brasserie, as were the other five people at dinner that night.  When I first walked in I had high expectations!  The restaurant is gorgeous and hosts a classy, fun atmosphere.  The service was also wonderful--quick, courteous, and professional.  We were all getting excited about our food...until it was served.  Nothing was awful, but there much left to be desired.  I ordered a shrimp appetizer and snapper, but wasn't tempted to finish more than half of either course.  I was with a group who plays nice and shares, and I didn't feel my friends' meals were any better.  I did enjoy the creme brule, but not enough to redeem my meal.  My husband says he actually did enjoy his meal but felt it was slightly overpriced given the quality of food.  After dinner we took a quick poll and 6/6 agreed we wouldn't be back.
