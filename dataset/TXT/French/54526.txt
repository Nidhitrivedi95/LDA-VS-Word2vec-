rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw Bardot is beautiful. The food is fantastic. Go there wearing your fat pants. The end.

Okay, so obviously reviews need a bit more detail but that's the gist of it. Bardot stands out in a city overwhelmed with French restaurants both on- and off-Strip. It's great for a business meal, a date night, a special event, or even just sitting at the bar for dessert to treat yourself. So far my visits have been limited to a networking event with passed appetizers and seafood and a group brunch, but I'll definitely be back for dinner soon.

Standouts include their cheese (duh), charcuterie, fresh oysters, escargot, and any incarnation of terrine or foie gras. I'm sure their entrees are great, but I'd go wild with multiple appetizers instead. My next visit will include the beef tartare and onion soup for sure.

You can't go wrong with their brunch options. Mussels have a great, complex broth and a massive mountain of a portion. The giant French toast is amazingly light with a great vanilla mascarpone and the world's fanciest granola bar garnish. The Hunter's Waffle with duck confit was a nice balance of sweet and savory. It took all of my self control not to run off with Cint B's Short Rib Croissant Benedict.  

Just go, tout de suite.
