vg55SAkrEmuHpWfIMtJjBQ Excellent service, atmosphere, and food.  Started at the bar and had an excellent whiskey sour.  Made with an egg white and topped with bitters it was excellent.  We had the tasting menu.  One vegetarian and one non vegetarian.  Each course was tasty with excellent presentation.  Plenty of food but not so much that we left stuffed.  The wait staff knew the menu well including ingredients and preparation.  We will be back for sure!
