i5vxtyiHKYnRcJ0p9N7mLw Nice going you guys! The vibe reminded me of the Italian delis back in Little Italy in the Bronx where I used to live: small but welcoming with all my favorite recipes written on a chalkboard behind the counter. I ordered the spaghetti bolognese while my wife ordered the antipasta. Both portions were large. The salad was fresh with plenty of salami and cheese. My spaghetti was excellent. It had a generous amount of hamburg and the sauce was very tasty. The server and the owner Carlo both came over at different times to check if we enjoyed the meal. We will be returning there soon.
