Da6eZFThE9xanUAGNpZxAg My friend and I came here for Summerlicious, and you wouldn't find another place that gives you THAT much food for the price. It was unbelievable! Don't bother going to the fancy restaurants that give you minimal food for $45. The food was one word - AMAZING. Would definitely come back here after Summerlicious. 
The meat and cheese board - amazing. The mussels - amazing. The short ribs - amazing.
