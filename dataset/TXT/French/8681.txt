4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I was FINALLY able to make it to this restaurant after numerous times of being envious walking past of all the people enjoying their meals on the patio! I came here for brunch on Saturday & was lucky enough to get a patio table for 2 people in a little less than 30 minutes!

I was starving so of course I ordered way too much food, but it was all great! I started with a Fruit Salad & the Onion Soup Au Gratin. The Fruit Salad was pretty standard, fresh & came with a side of yogurt & brown sugar. The Onion Soup Au Gratin was as good as it looked! The melted cheese on top was the best part! I also had the Quiche Lorraine which was delicious! The crust was perfectly crisp & baked flawlessly! The Quiche Lorraine has bacon, jarlsberg cheese, & caramelized onions.

The serving staff was friendly, but the hostess weren't as much. Had to ask for my second drink a couple of times, but my dining experience was great. You can't beat the view of the Bellagio fountains & people-watching pedestrians right on the Strip. 

I would definitely recommend this restaurant for Brunch on the patio or any meal of the day! They seem to have a great menu to satisfy anyone. I can't wait to return when I'm back in Vegas!
