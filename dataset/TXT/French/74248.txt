xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g The best piece of meat I have ever had!!! This filet mignon melted with the plunge of the fork and then in my mouth. Asparagus al dente - perfect.  Any dessert is so good it is almost perverted. Service is good but dont expect california fakeness or ignorant drivel. Just get to the business of eating a fabulous meal.
