Had pan seared scallops and it was a good size portion. The warm baguette with sumptuous butter was to die for. Prices of bottles wine, though a bit limited in choice,  are extremely reasonable. Tarte tartin a la mode ended my dinner on a high note! 

The service was impeccable and extremely friendly. This is a family business and one would always feel welcomed! Two thumbs up and would go back anytime!
