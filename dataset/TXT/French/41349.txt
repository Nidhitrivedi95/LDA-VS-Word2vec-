kGOr_D-LNpgZ2M9N8TT4QQ Been to la société a couple times- once for dinner and recently for brunch.

I have to recommend the dinner hour. More dynamic menu and a quiet ambiance... Parfait pour se détendre.

 At brunch I had the steak et frites. Lovely steak, fries a bit too oily, but la mayonnaise maison saved the day. You have not had mayo until you've had it house (or at least French) made.

For dinner service, I highly recommend the seared foie gras appetizer, and any of the main entrées. The Duck confit and rainbow trout were both satisfying. 

I RECOMMEND- Their glass of rosé with brunch. Mimosas are so overrated. 

EXTRA TIP- the Sunday brunch hour dies down by 1pm, so no reservation is typically needed past 1:30pm.
