4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Still awesome ! Went there this weekend and had the baked goats cheese appetizer which is awesome and I had the shrimp cocktail ( clean and good) while my daughter loved the classic steak frite.This is the best place to grab a great meal and people watch- while also catching the bellagio  fountain show
