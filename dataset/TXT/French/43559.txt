m4PW-GMc8JOU5nmMYncu-Q THE BEST COCKTAILS EVER!!!

My friends, I do not kid you when I say this... I love cocktails and have tried many places and this place wins hands down! If there is any place from my recent visit to Montreal that will make me come back for more, it's this place!

Le Lab has the retro-cool vibe as soon as you enter. You can see a vintage cash register and some other cool stuff lying around. The place was super crowded but I think we got lucky and found a table pretty quickly. The place is very dimly lit and we did have to use our phones to read the menu. My favourite drink was 'lemon in the sky', it said in the description that it was like a dessert drink and yum it was. It wasn't super sweet but it came with vanilla cream on top and the cream was so creamy, it was the creamiest cream I've ever had, that's how creamy it was! Just writing this review is making my mouth water for the drink. There was not a single drink that any of us ordered which was below par, each drink was fantastic! Next on my list was a flaming shot that came with marshmallow. This again was superb! My final drink for the evening was another shot called 'Kiss me baby' and boy did I want to be kissed again!

All of us had 3 drinks each and everyone loved their drinks. We may have sipped each others first drink but after that everyone was pretty protective of their drinks. 
The DJ here was fantastic and the performance by the bartenders was so much fun! 

Hats off to the bartenders for creating one amazing drink after the other and to all cocktail lovers out there, you need to come here ASAP!!!

PS: This place may turn you into an alcoholic.
