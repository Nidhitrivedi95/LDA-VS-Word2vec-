pmoIMK8zGWvKsVOPDBYfzg The service was superb.  The decor is tres chic!  I love that there is this elegant, not HUGE (like everything else in Vegas) but perfectly quaint high quality restaurant in the middle of a Casino/Hotel!  Our waiters were amazing - the provided us with extra attention - we never wanted or needed for anything - and the truffles they provide at the end of the dinner were AMAZING! Also - look for the Travelzoo - that is how we did it - sooooooooo worth it.  The chocolate soufle'e is the bomb!
