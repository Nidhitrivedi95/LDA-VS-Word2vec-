jA3xcba82t8x06H8NzG4VQ Wow!  A group of us headed over to the Black Pig for brunch.  We loved everything about the place.  The outside sign is awesome.  The entire staff was very welcoming and friendly.  The atmosphere is great.  Each of us ordered something different off their brunch menu.  Everything came out amazing!  I ordered the Black Pig Burger that comes with shallot jam, mushrooms, brie, and aioli.  AWESOME!I love a good burger and this place has the best burger I have ever had! We were grateful that their portion sizes are large so that we could all sample each of our brunch choices.  When we are all back in town - we will definitely be back!  I know that their menu changes because they get local, seasonal ingredients, but I sure do hope they have that burger when I come back.
