_O12nlv3sISPfiNAQVLM4Q We had an office across the street from this restaurant and I had a funny experience I wanted to share.  The restaurant looks like it hasn't been renovated since it was built in the 70's so there's an interesting old school vibe here.  That night there was a "celebrity" chef on duty who was this little only man (probably all of 4' tall, 5' with the hat) came to our table to present his menu.  Being the only non-French speaker at the table, I relied on my colleague to assist me in my entree selection.  All sounded good until I asked why the chef emphatically suggested his Boeuf Bourguignon...

She was in mid-conversation (are the French ever not? I love that.) and simply motioned to me by tugging on the side of her mouth, smiling and saying "oh, la, la".  - all suggesting to me that either she wanted to dance or that this dish was the most succulent beef this side of the Rhone.

So it would appear that I'd be a complete fool, a dumb American, perhaps even the dreaded horse's ass to not order the Boeuf Bourguignon.   So I did (for myself AND the honor of my country).

Being an American, I typically enjoy looking at my beef in either hockey puck patty or steak format (anyone with me?).  Upon first examination, what arrived on my plate was pretty close so I dug in....and it was indeed d-e-l-i-c-i-o-u-s.

About half way through my dinner, I observed my two French colleagues (from Paris actually) giggling and looking in my direction.  Typically this means that I've either something sinister hanging from my chin or they have a plan to stick me with the bill.  However, when I inquired, they responded "we're just proud of you for being so adventurous".  

Adventurous?  I asked. 

Adventurous.  The chef's specialty was in utilizing lesser known "parts" such as the neck, cheek and, um, jewels.  

...and so my adventure began.
