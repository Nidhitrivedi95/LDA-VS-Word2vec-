B56AYe5GNuavMDtwFsXqzA Wow ! It's like eating in Paris without the rude service and people speaking French . Delicious foie gras , with bananas and Carmel popcorn side - perfect combination of sweet and savory . The bouillabaisse had a nice  blend  of seafood complemented by an amazing broth. I had the sorbet for desert , but it had a touch too much ginger . Ask for the perfect wine parings .... Service was sharp and atmosphere excellent . Definitely bookmarked and on the list for my next trip to Scottsdale .
