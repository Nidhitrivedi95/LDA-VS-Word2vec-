We knew it wasn't going to be gourmet, but we did not expect it to be repulsive.  After hunting down the server to finally take our order, we ordered drinks, our entrees and nachos as an appetizer.  The nachos came out and there was a grey curly hair melted into the cheese on top.  It was gross, but I know that sometimes things happen, so I tossed that chip aside and went in for another.  Under the top layer of chips was another hair, but this one was long and black and completely melted into all of the chips.  There was probably even more hair under that, but we did not dig any further.  We called the server over and asked her to cancel the entrees and to bring us a bill for the drinks.  She refused to cancel the entrees because they were almost done.  When I showed her a chip with melted hair on it, she just yanked the hair off the chip and ignored it!!!  Then the manager came out and also refused to cancel our entrees.  After 10 minutes of arguing with multiple staff members, our server finally agreed to cancel the entrees and gave us the bill for the drinks and told us, "YOU'RE LUCKY we cancelled the order".  I do not understand how it is lucky that we got hair-filled food and horrible service!!  I assume that most restaurants do not treat tourists as well as regulars, but this was awful.  I do not know if I am more repulsed by the food or the way we were treated by the staff.  If I could give this place less than 1 star, I would.  DO NOT EAT HERE!
