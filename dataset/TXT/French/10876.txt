4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw When it comes to food in Vegas, the options are aplenty, but I find myself returning to Mon Ami time and time again. A reasonably priced restaurant with delicious French cuisine right on the Vegas strip? I couldn't have dreamed up a better place myself. Been here for brunch and dinner on multiple occasions, and they were all were fabulous. Favorite menu items here are escargot (you just have to at a French restaurant, right?), skate wing, and beef wellington, which was the daily special on either a Friday or Saturday. Foie gras was also delicious, even though I don't love foie gras. I just had to order it because it's been outlawed where I live. Yep.

The service is friendly, and the ambiance is perfect. So much so that when you leave the restaurant, you may be confused as to why you are in the middle of the desert, and not in fact on the streets of Paris. The outdoor seating is definitely the way to go if you like to people watch (which is on another level in Vegas), weather permitting. If you didn't manage a reservation, you can still sit really close to the open patio and feel like you're dining outside without the commitment of actually being outside.
