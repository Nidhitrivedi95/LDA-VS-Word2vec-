rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw Went there for Sunday brunch our last day in Vegas.  Even without reservations we were seated in under 30 minutes.  Our server was great and brought out bread and butter promptly.  It would have been better if the baguette was warm.  Had the bloody mary which was a featured drink, nothing special about it.

We started with the escargots.  Honestly, was a bit disappointed as the order only had 4 escargots and previous pictures on Yelp showed 6.  They were tasty but very small.  For our main course we ordered, the croque madame, nutella sticky bun, and French toast.  The egg on the croque madame was perfect, runny and warm.  The French toast is huge.  It's definitely a dish that can be shared.  Really liked how they were able to keep the inside soft and custardy and the contrast of the almond brittle and vanilla mascarpone was perfect.  My favorite dish was the nutella sticky bun.  A little pricey for one sticky bun but well worth the calories and very memorable.  We'll definitely be back.
