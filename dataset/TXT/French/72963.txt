XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q In May my husband and I went to Las Vegas for the Uncork'd Las Vegas event.  While there, we decided to tack on an extra day specifically so that we could dine at Joel Robuchon.  We are both dedicated foodies and while far from experts, we truly appreciate a good meal.

The dining room at Robuchon is exquisite, with purple velvet sofas, coordinating chairs and yellow and white flowers.  The chandelier over the main dining room is divine, and I couldn't stop staring at it.

The menu is divided into number of courses.  You can order a 2-cours, 4-course, 6-course and the entire degustation.  Typically we would have ordered the 16 course degustation, but decided it was cost prohibitive being that we had already spent a considerable amount on the event that we were attending.  Instead, we opted for a 6-course menu.

The food was very good, notably my husband's Langoustine Ravioli.  I was also impressed by the bread cart, the cheese selection and the mignardiise selection.  It was lovely to have so many choices.  We also had 2 glasses of wine each, one to compliment the earlier, lighter courses, and one to compliment the later, heavier courses.

I won't describe each course as many have already done so.  Suffice it to say that Robuchon mostly lives up to it's reputation.  But overall, I would say that The French Laundry is better, and RM Seafood.Tru and Charlie Trotter's easily come to the same standard - and for less money.  Our bill was just over $1000, compared to the $800 we paid at The French Laundry for more courses and what I think was better food.  Given the choice to do one of the two restaurants again, The French Laundry would win, hands downl
