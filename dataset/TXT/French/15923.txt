6t7U64hS_cBZtVKSP-q5Ww 0 stars. We asked how long it'd take to get our food since we wanted to take it aboard the plane. The order took longer than the reported time. We then asked if it was possible to take what has been prepared to board the plane but the server/hostess made no effort to accommodate. We ended up forgoing the food to board our plane. This is our first time at this restaurant, and we had expected more based on the cost we paid (for food we never received). We are very disappointed. We will never visit this restaurant again and highly recommend avoiding this restaurant.
