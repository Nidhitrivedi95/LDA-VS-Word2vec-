4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw What a joke. Ordered the blueberry waffles. Comes with blueberries on top must have come out of the freezer so needless to say waffles cold. 2nd order comes out, blueberries on the side still cold put some butter on it and it was whipped butter it didn't even melt.  But the date glazed bacon was good !!
