mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q We made reservations here as our special meal in Vegas for our honeymoon. We are both familiar with Joel Robuchon's reputation and were excited to dine here based on reviews we had read and the fact that it has a Michelin Star. 

Unfortunately, it did not live up to any of the hype for us. 

Service: This was mostly fine. Our main waiter was very kind and acknowledged we were celebrating a special occasion upon arriving. There was a gentleman, perhaps the general manger or sommelier, that really put a damper on the meal as he scowled at us and other customers and hovered around behind the bar for our whole time there. He was very nice and inviting to a couple next to us which made us feel like we were less valued diners. 

Food: Uninspired and underwhelming. We did not do the tasting menu, maybe if we did we would feel differently...but to be honest nothing looked that special or need-to-try on the tasting menus for us.
We tried a few dishes including the seared foie gras, sweetbreads, langoustines, and steak tartare. The langoustines at $60 were the biggest disappointment of the evening--three langoustines fried in wonton wrappers with a few dots of pesto. 

Overall, pretty disappointing. We were so excited to try it out, but the meh food and weird sommelier made us feel like we should have eaten somewhere else.
