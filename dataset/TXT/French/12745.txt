4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw The top 3 words to an ideal property is location location location!!!!! Mon Ami Gabi has completely captured that. Not going to lie, but even if the food was bad, people would still come in, watch the Bellagio show, and probably leave a little unhappy but still glad they got a pretty good seat.
But here's the thing - they serve GOOD food.. great food I would say and at completely reasonable prices, not to mention the free music / water show across the street. 

We were able to make reservations for 9:30 after the Chris Angel show at the luxor, and although the patio is first come first serve, it happened to open up before our inside dining room table was ready. The waitress was patient, polite and helpful. We all got a great view of the bellagio which was breathtaking.

I ordered the salmon that came with a bed of orzo. The portion was extremely large and the salmon was cooked beautifully. The orzo was well seasoned and I enjoyed every last bite. Watching my friends - their dishes were huge, including the size of mussels which looked like they had doubled in regular size. The fries ordered were unique, skinny and flat, something I've never tried before.

No one's bank was broken after this as prices ranged anywhere from $ 15 - $25 dollars.. and a bit more expensive for the dishes that were out of the ordinary. Everyone was completely satisfied and the hot heat just made it a perfect night to site outside.

I know people who have rituals to eat here everytime they come to Vegas. I would like to start this tradition myself the next time I come back!
