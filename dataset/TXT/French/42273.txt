L3VlGzHgsbmaZ5oUnWvINg Riverside is like many early relationships. In the beginning, you are excited to have found a gem in the sad state of bar affairs that is Kent. You see a wonderful patio with a river and train tracks. You see an adorably decorated interior.  You see an awesome menu of wine and a great seasonal beers.  ...And then you think, I have found the one.

Then you go on many *dates* with this restaurant and the shininess fades and it's true self shines through...and you are disappointed  all over again.  Riverside on the outside is so enticing, but the more you attend, the more you see the flaws.  The staff is hit or miss -- I've had good and bad service.  The wine selection doesn't often change for buying by the glass -- and the flights are incredibly overpriced.  The corkage fee is also a giant downer.  The food is decent (though I'm pretty sure they buy the hummus from the store and take off the top, but the pita makes up for it) but also quite pricey.  The owner is very stingy on samples and service. You often have to pay a dollar to try a sip of beer -- and the wine tasting Saturdays are not as good as a value as many other places.  I've also heard the owner yelling at his staff on more than one occasion.  

Quick anecdote: We asked the server to split our check once (right down the middle w 2 credit cards).  The server said he could not because he does not have a calculator...

All in all, I return when my friends and I want to class it up and pretend we are somewhere nicer - but lately I leave feeling underwhelmed and out a lot of money.
