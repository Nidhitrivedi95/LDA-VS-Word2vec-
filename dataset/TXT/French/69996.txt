wrZOLGBk5kLs4mnEijSEZw Food: The duck confit sandwich was moist and flavorful, seasoned perfectly. The crunchiness of the toast, the tenderness of the meat and the rich smooth flavor of the cheese, all combined to create a mixture of different textures which is amazing and a surprise for the palate with each bite. 

Service: Staff are friendly and joyful~

Value: $8 for a sandwich with duck confit, I would say it was somewhat reasonable~

Ambiance: Visited their stall at Bouffons Montreal. One of the best stall as they installed comfy couches for customers to enjoy their meal comfortably.
