The atmosphere was upscale and clean. The music was at a nice level, not too loud. All of the staff was very professional and attentative. Not much bad to say about Bistro 57 besides its location and the fact that Aliante Casino has the tightest machines outside of the strip which keeps the casino kinda empty. In Summerlin, this place would be packed on the weekend. The place looks too fancy for the area and I figure most people walk past it heading to the buffet, Friday's, or the food court.
