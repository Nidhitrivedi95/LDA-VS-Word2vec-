hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA I was staying in Vegas for the weekend and wanted to find a hidden gem that was not on the strip. I came here because they were on Yelp's top 100 places to eat list and I can clearly see why. 

This cafe is hidden on the side of a few business buildings, but it was not hard to find at all. The staff were super friendly and I can see that everything was prepared and baked fresh daily. Another plus was the patio area they had for seating. It was very clean and had just the right amount of shade. It is a great setting for casual brunch with friends. After debating between a lot of great choices, I ended up getting the Croissant, egg, and ham sandwich. You can either have this just with egg or pick a protein of choice. And I have to admit that this was the BEST croissant sandwich I have every had. I recommend this to anyone to comes here! The croissant was extremely fresh and flaky, and I really liked the sauce/dressing they added into the egg. The sandwich was also paired with a nice salad on the side and I also order a fresh orange juice; both of which were equally enjoyable as well. I will definitely be back to try the other baked goods next time I am in town!
