O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q We have gone twice this trip for cocktails, late night bite and lunch. The cheese platter was the best I have ever had. The French onion soup was good and had a tomato bisque stock to it which I enjoyed. Something different for a change. I had the mussels which were amazing in a white wine not over garlicky taste. My husband had the turkey avocado blt which was delicious. The avocado was perfect and the bacon was thick. Their drink variety, especially scotch is one of the best. We sat at the bar both times and each bartender was friendly and professional but down to earth. The managers that we spoke to because he likes to come out and get a vibe of what's happening is very professional and friendly. They go above and beyond at this establishment.
