My friend and I were part of the VIP group for SPG and TotalRewards.  We were treated to a complimentary brunch at this restaurant right on the Las Vegas strip!

It was a seat-yourself event where any table left open was yours for the taking.  The tables were already prepared with a delicious cantaloupe bowl of fruit with sides of brown sugar and mint syrup and a plate of salmon.

The entrees were fantastic.  I thoroughly enjoyed the bananas foster french toast - with just the right amount of creamy goodness!  My friend enjoyed the Eggs Benedict, which we read they were known for.

I don't even know what to say about the delicious chocolate mousse.  I mean really - it was melt in your mouth chocolate with the addition of what tasted like the chocolate crunches in ice cream cake formulated into a little ball and served over the mousse.  Texture perfection.

The mimosas served were also quite large - I mean, hey, it's Vegas.... 

Service was great.  Very polite and accommodating for a large group event.
