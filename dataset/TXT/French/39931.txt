K64Uw3a2Enh2MznpwRHWKQ This is a good restaurant in most ways. The entrees and appetizers were very good. The wine list was decent by the glass and amazing for higher end wines. It is expensive to dine here: soup and salad over $10 and appetizers mid to upper teens with entrees mid-twenties to upper thirties.  If price is no object this is the place to go. Neither we nor the couple we were with are price sensitive so we were happy when we left. We split the bill so I signed for half of it and added a 25%+ tip. Later when I checked my credit card, as I do daily in these paranoid times, I realized I had been charged for my half plus the full bill so I had been triple charged. The person I talked to at the restaurant wasn't overly impressed about my concern. He pointed out (correctly) that the debit will eventually be removed. My problem is one that we don't think about a lot: every time you hand the server your credit card you trust them to use it appropriately: not only no fraud but also no carelessness.  I take them at their word that the charge will be reversed. That being the case, I would hesitate to hand this restaurant my credit card again. Somebody isn't paying close attention to credit card use.
