5fquJHY2hMX9tPRD5s0t5g Went here with a few co-workers after a conference on the first night of Restaurant Week. We came in with six diners without a reservation around 6:00 and were told we could be seated but we'd have to be out of our booth by 8:00. I've never had a restaurant tell me that my booth was pre-reserved before but considering we were in a big leather booth near the window I guess it made sense. Unfortunately, when we were told that the RW menu had to be eaten by the whole table instead of just by the people who wanted it our numbers dropped to four as two people left to find more casual dining elsewhere. Rooster was worth sticking around for- I got to the RW in Providence and Boston every year and their menu knocked almost everything else I've eaten up north out of the water. I got the heirloom tomato salad, steak, and creme brulee and it was totally worth paying full price, never mind $30 total. Convenient location, incredible food and good service (except for our waitress forgetting to explain the RW stipulations before we ordered drinks which confused things a bit when folks tried to leave). Would definitely eat at Rooster again the next time I'm in Charlotte.
