Ok
I love French food.
I love cajun food.
Thus, I love this place.

I came here for a Saturday brunch
Had the croque monsieur.

So good!

Unlike the croque monsieur's typically found in France, this one was served on a very thick French brioche type bread, and was filled with chipped ham and gruyere cheese, then topped with a bechamel sauce.

OMG.

Very rich, very unhealthy, very tasty.

To wash it down, I had some sort of champagne and elder cocktail.  Also delicious.
I also thought it was very reasonably priced.

I can't wait to come back and try more things at this place.
