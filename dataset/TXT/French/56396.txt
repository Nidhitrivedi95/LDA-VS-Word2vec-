rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A For once, something lives up to the hype! We were seated within 5 minutes on a Sunday at 11 AM and proceeded to order their breakfast americaine and the chicken and waffles. Our coffees tasted amazing (I went down to the bakery to buy the beans right after) and was possibly the best blend I've had. My friend's waffles came out perfectly (crispy with generous specks of bacon and chive) and her chicken was so moist. I loved the maple syrup and vanilla bean butter that came with it. The ligonberry jam and butter that came for my brioche was really high-quality (I noticed it and wouldn't normally notice my butter and jam!) and my eggs were the most perfectly fried eggs I've ever seen - evenly fried, not too greasy. Fresh grapefruit juice, 6 crispy strips of bacon, and two sausages later, I felt sufficiently but not overly full, and appreciated the fresh and expertly cooked taste of each item we had.
