Do not even eat here without a window table to see the view.

Every step of the service was flawless from the hostesses at the casino level who were very friendly and prompt, to the seating hostesses, the sommelier, etc.

Our captain was Alix Briand and she is a star.
What a pleasure to have a dining experience executed by her.

I had the salmon appetizer and beet and goat cheese salad, and veggie sides as I don't eat meat.

Guests had halibut, steak, and leg of lamb and all were completely blown away.

Wine, dessert, sorbet and cookies at the end were a special touch.
Save up your calories for this spot as it's worth it and a must eat on your Vegas vacation.
