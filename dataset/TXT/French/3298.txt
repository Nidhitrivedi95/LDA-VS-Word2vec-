1cGyzWtfOoDiE8V0OR85yA The crepes here are AWESOME.  The place is pretty small so keep that in mind when going.  Also, you have to put in your order prior to sitting- some people try to do otherwise and save tables beforehand, which isn't allowed.

Both the savory and sweet crepes here are good.  I usually go with someone and we both get savory crepes and share a sweet one as 'dessert'.  The mushroom, spinach, and cheese crepe with the house sauce my go-to choice.  For sweet, nutella and banana is always a safe default.  Hard to go wrong with nutella and anything!

Oh, also note that they only take cash!
