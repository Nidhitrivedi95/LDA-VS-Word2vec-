0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g If I had to give a rating based on food and pricing alone, I would have to give this place 3 stars. However, because we chose outside seating, we got one of the best views possible from any restaurant (Dare I say... one of the best in the world?). I would probably say it was worth the price just from the view alone- we had a front row seat for the Bellagio fountain water show, and eating in that atmosphere, watching the show and taking in the view of Las Vegas is an experience I won't soon be forgetting. 
The food was--- not up to my expectations. Maybe I had really high expectations because of all the 5 star reviews from yelpers and friends. We had the $95/person tasting course, and I have had better food at other restaurants that were less pricey. The fish all tasted a like, and the meat was kind of dry. The oysters, however, were fantastic. As for dessert... too sweet in my opinion.  The wines were waaay over-priced, but I guess that is what you can expect at this kind of ritsy restaurant. 
The service was okay as well. Of course, they never let your water glass reach emptiness, and they bring your food while it is hot. They smile politely and make polite conversation. However, it just felt like they were doing their job (which I am sure they were) and not really too "genuine" and warm. 
I am super-happy I got to have this experience though!.. like I said, the view from the outside balcony/courtyard (however they call it) is just delicious :).
