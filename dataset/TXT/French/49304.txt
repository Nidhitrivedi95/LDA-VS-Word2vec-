or4UVDjXEEjze3wNPjoAZA Got seated right away (had reservations)
20 mins to get drinks 
25 mins after that to get cheese plate
25 mins after finished with cheese plate to get soup/salad
18 mins to get entree after finishing soup.
Scallops came out cold.  They replaced it in less than 3 mins (food for me, bad for someone else).

Vegetarian option is 1 pasta dish or salad...no ability to make a veggie plate.  

Really need better wait staff.  Doubt we will ever go back.
