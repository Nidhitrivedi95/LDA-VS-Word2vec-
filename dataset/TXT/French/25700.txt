Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA This review is for the lounge only. With the way Vegas is hurting it was not a surprise we were offered  free coupon for a drink and entrance for this place. For a Friday night the crowd was thin. The view is pretty kewl as you get to see the whole strip in its glory from high up. We enjoyed our drinks with a cigar in the balcony and headed out. Not much else to say. Maybe the food is better.
