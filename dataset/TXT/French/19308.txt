aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw nom!!! we just checked in and first thing we got was .... 
macarons at bouchon bakery!! =)

yes, they are expensive at $3.50 a piece but they are also 2x the size of your regular
macarons. these are palm sized!! =) it's as if two macarons merged and formed voltron-macaron!

got pistachio and coffee -- both have great chewy shell, tepid to the touch (so not hard and frigid) and delicious lightly sweetened fillings. =) i think i may favor these over 'lettes! will have to grab more on our way out!!

*edit -- got more!!! we had 2 butter crossiants, the vanilla macaron and chocolate macaron. SO DELICIOUS that we made an extra trip back for this. ;) Favorite macaron was the VANILLA.
