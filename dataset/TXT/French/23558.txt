CJ0pTLbWP02jiirzuWJCKw Very busy bakery,deli and café, with lots of mainly hearty "go with your soup or stew" bread. Bought my usual breakfast bread,see how it compares with those from other places I favour,the cinnamon danish I scarfed down before work,was very fluffy and good sized, but without any pronounced cinnamon flavour. Not bad,but not great either, although better than the corner store variety.
