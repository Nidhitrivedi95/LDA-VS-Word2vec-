I came here for breakfast and was tempted by pretty much everything on the menu, but I ended up with the egg white omelet and sampled my husband's strawberry and banana big skinny pancakes.  Both were excellent.  I also had a ginger peach hot tea that smelled lovely and was very flavorful.  Our server was very fast even though the place was packed, so I was pretty impressed.  When I'm in Vegas again, I'll probably be heading here for breakfast.
