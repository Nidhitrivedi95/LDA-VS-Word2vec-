rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I really was looking forward to eating here because of the great reviews I have read on yelp. It was  a disappointment. The service was ok, I was expecting to get great service from the staff but they were not up to par. I ordered the trout which was the only tasty thing from dinner. I like how it was presented, the head and all. It was cooked perfectly and really light. We ordered the short rib and it was okay. It was a little dry and the sauce was lacking in depth. We also shared a salmon appetizer. It was basically smoked salmon in a jar and it was not that interesting. I don't think I will be coming back.
