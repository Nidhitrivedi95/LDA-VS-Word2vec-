4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Very disappointed! This used to be a favorite restaurant of ours. However, we just dined there last night. My husband is on very restricted diet and avoids carbs and/ or sugar. He ordered steak and salad which we dressed with vinegar and oil to avoid any hidden sugars in their prepared dressing. We asked that the steak not be prepared with any flavorings or sauces on it. This morning his sugar level, which has been consistent for weeks now, soared almost 30 points. I think that, in spite of our carefulness, the steak must have had some kind of sugar in the flavoring. I realize that there is a reason sugar diabetes is rampant in our country because it is so darn difficult to avoid unnecessary sugar in your food when you eat out or buy prepared food of any sort. Unfortunately. This restaurant is now "Off our List!" It's a shame.
