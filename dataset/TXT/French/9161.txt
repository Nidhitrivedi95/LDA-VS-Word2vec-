This is one of my favorite places to go to breakfast, lunch or dinner on the strip! Mon Ami Gabi is located in the Paris Hotel on the Las Vegas strip. This restaurant has both indoor dinning and outside dinning. I highly recommend sitting outside so that you can see the lovely Bellagio Hotel water shows. Not to mention the people watching. Never know what you will see on the strip! Mon Ami Gabi is very busy so we decided to go late (around 9:30pm) for dinner. When ordering drinks, our waiter informed us that they were out of Disaronno. We ordered the Warm Brie Cheese appetizer and Steak Au Poivre (brandy peppercorn sauce). The appetizer came out and it was unusually small. As I was looking around I noticed a table next to us had ordered it as well and it was equally small. I also caught the waiter telling the customer they were out of whatever it was that he had ordered. I must say that this is very unusual and I most definitely will not be going again on a Monday night. Our steaks were wonderful and I will go there again for not just the food but the atmosphere. Dinner and a show!
