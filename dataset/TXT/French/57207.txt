rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A My restaurant experience was, in one word, superb:

*Elevator from the parking structure directly to the restaurant is a nice touch, especially when you're hungry.

*Went there for Sunday brunch on Mother's Day, so we expected a long wait... and got it.  Was told 1 hour.  Nibbled on a complimentary pastry while we waited and were seated in around a half hour. (Read: don't get discouraged if your wait is long---it's worth it.)

*Stellar service.  It felt like we had 3-4 different people on standby just waiting to refill our drinks, bread, practically anything or ask us how we were doing.  Amazing, considering how busy they were.  The only thing we had to ask for was the check.

*The food took a bit long to come out (then again hunger has a tendency to slow time), but they kept us occupied with bread and this delectable peach preserve (definitely tasted like it was made in-house).

*Everything we had was fresh, expertly balanced, cooked perfectly, and just plain delicious.  You must try the RILLETTES AU SAUMONS (appetizer of fresh/smoked salmon with baguettes), MOULES AU SAFRAN (mussels in a wine/saffron broth), CHICKEN & WAFFLES (self-explanatory; far and away the best I've had).

*The prices were very reasonable.  Our appetizer was about $15 and the entrees were about $25.   

*The only down-side was that the tables felt too close together.  It was kind of distracting hearing other conversations loud & clear when you're trying to have your own.  An acceptable inconvenience once you get your food and you're too busy enjoying it to talk much!

(As an aside, the macaron from the bakery was a bit of a disappointment after my great experience here---see Buchon Bakery review)
