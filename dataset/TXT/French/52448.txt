q0n4I-zqiI47xispOqc1lA I wanted to try this place for a long time and went there on a Sunday for brunch with my girl friend. Initially was apprehensive to go in as the look of the building was bad. When I entered the people inside were very friendly and helpful. They have fruit salad, eggs, bottom less coffee and sweet crep for just 13.99. Can't get better deal than that
