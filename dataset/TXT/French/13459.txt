But the high wore off into a malaise as I got into the second hour. But is it the restaurant's fault, or my wife's?

We finished our breakfast, but as implied, my wife wanted more. Could the Brioche be better at the "Paris Las Vegas" than it is back home? Verdict: Brioche really not that good, really didn't melt in my mouth like really fluffy versions of it do. Not nearly good as good as Los Angeles or San Francisco standards. Plus, because of my wife, I had to wait 40 extra minutes for order, eat and exit. Drove me nuts. Is there a wisdom to be gained here? Such as: Don't let wife order extra meal. I dunno, I'm so over "Paris." But put on "Funny Face" (1957) with Audrey Hepburn on my DVD and I'm enchanted with life all over again. #crabbywhiteguy
