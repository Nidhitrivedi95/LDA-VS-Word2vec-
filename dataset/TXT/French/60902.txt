SD7vTf-H00J8BS3L-kt7jg Great architecture and trendy ambiance. 

Fresh oysters served with vinegar were tasteful. When it arrived, the braised lamb shank was cold. Miso cod, which came half floating in an asian soup was good. 

They offer an exhaustive wine list which is interesting. I had a delicious IP (private importation) white Marsannay. 

Service and food were in general good, not the best though.

Maybe a bit overrated?

I'd say 3 1/2 stars.
