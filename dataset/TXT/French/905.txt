_cjPEH9wXhKS-HQe_U3M4Q We celebrated my birthday at Le Select and the place lived up to the expectations. The food was very good, except for French Onion Soup that had excessive amounts of cheese, too much bread, and not enough onions. I also had goat cheese salad and Bouillabaisse, both were excellent. My husband had escargot in pastry and bison steak tartar, he loved them both. We both finished our meals with creme brulee - excellent. The service was fine, it was quick and friendly. Make sure to go to the washroom (even if you don't need to), you will see their kitchen - yes, they have french speaking staff there - and absolutely amazing wine cellar (see picture). Speaking of wine, they have crazy wine selection (300+), but everything is quite pricey. We noticed that the main menu also had few wines and these were a bit more reasonably priced, we ended up getting a bottle of Cab-Merlot for $50 (I think this was the cheapest option) but it was still quite good. The complementary parking at the back was a nice touch. Unfortunately, it was a cold rainy day so outdoor seating wasn't an option. Overall, we had a good experience and will likely come back, but we paid just under $250 for the two of us, so this is certainly a place for special occasions...
