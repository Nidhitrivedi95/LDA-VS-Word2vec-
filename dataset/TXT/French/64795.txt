teTQU7TIPE0O_B1zN_239w My second visit:
I was looking for a good place to have breakfast that was close to where I live since I had to go to work soon. I didn't know Mimis served breakfast so I thought I would give it a try. When I arrived at 7:25 am there was only one other party. I waited a few minutes for someone to seat me. I didn't see anyone so I thoughtI would peruse the menu while I stood there. Finally a server showed up and sat me. She took my drink order and soon brought my coffee (+water even though I didn't ask for water=nice touch) and took my order right then. Another nice touch, since I was pressed for time. Then a coffee warm up right away. I'm liking this visit so far. Good coffee btw. We'll see how the breakfast is....
Wow. I ordered the corned beef hash, potatoes, toast. After I ordered I decided I wanted a croissant. It was all good. 
My breakfast experience was much better than my dinner experience. I'll definitely be back!

Below was my first visit:
I came here wanting to eat something different and honestly thought the appetizers looked really good. I WAS going to get like 2 or 3 of the appetizers and thats it. Against my better judgment I decided to get a ribeye steak 'medium'. I should have realized that I wasn't at a steakhouse. It was kind of tough and dry. I should have stuck with my first notion and gotten the meatballs and the artichoke hearts appetizers. The staff was nice even tho they were kind of busy. Next time. Next time. ..
