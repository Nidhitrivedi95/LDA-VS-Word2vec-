grHISDkIGwttYthhW8DxCQ We had a ham and cheese crepe as well as a Nutella, strawberry, and banana one, and they were great.  The crepe was tasty and chewy, as well as the fillings.  Each crepe also came with a since sized portion of fresh fruit.  Worth a try if you are looking for a crepe near downtown.
