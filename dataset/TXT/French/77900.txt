YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g Tal K and I eat here almost every time we come to Vegas.  I know, I know, we live in San Francisco and why not try something new?  Because it still tops my list as one of the best restaurants ever.  I'm happy to announce that the service, the food, and the ambiance matches the quality of the one in SF.  

So, yes, I am super impressed with the vegetarian tasting menu, but I'm even more impressed that they had noted that I'm vegetarian from the last time we ate there and so was handed the vegetarian menu upon arrival.  No awkward questions to see what the chef might be able to prepare for me sans meat.  It was already perfectly planned.  And it was amazing, as it is every time.  Last night, they had a tapioca soup for dessert.  It was very unusual with so many sensations to tease your palate, different sizes of tapioca balls, tangy and tart passion fruit sorbet mixed with fresh fruit.  That's what I call real love, the chef is always creating unique dishes.  I have never been disappointed by the staff or my meal.
