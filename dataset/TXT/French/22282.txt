BSmqxPbQglQwP2R56OqOag This was my second visit to this attractive restaurant. The first resulted in long wait, poor customer service but good food.  We went back today and it was such a disappointment.  We arrived to a virtually empty restaurant although it was 2pm.  The hostess sat us at a small two top.  We got our beverages quickly but no refills on water, no requested lemon and after 25 minutes with no sandwich, we inquired about our order. The waitress who never smiled said it was coming out...I replied it was almost 30 minutes...she gave me a rude look with rolling eyes and said "it will be here". We left $5 for the iced tea and left - she yelled "have a good day ladies" when we left.  No training in this place for customer service.  Expensive and yet absolutely no idea how to treat customers.  Won't be back!
