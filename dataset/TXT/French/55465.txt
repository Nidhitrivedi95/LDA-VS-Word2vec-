rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Not cheep, but fabulous, fabulous, FABULOUS!!  Not only was the food  great and service top notch, but the staff really went out of their way to make it a special night for my girlfriends and I who were in Vegas to celebrate.   I had high expectations and they managed to exceed every one of them.  I just wanted to the give the staff a big hug when I left, it was just that great!
