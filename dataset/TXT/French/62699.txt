SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ Freakin' awesome. Best apology dinner ever!....just kidding. 
We started with something called "tombo" which was seared tuna encrusted with black sesame seeds and black pepper. I am a little squeamish about eating things that have mushy/gushy/floppy textures so I was scared before trying it but it was INCREDIBLE. We engulfed that immediately and only waited briefly before getting our meals. 
Not only were the meals beautifully plated but they blew both of our minds. I believe my boyfriend got the beef tenderloin with horseradish whipped potatoes, sautéed spinach, and bacon onion jam. The jam sounds...terrifying but apparently it was good. I ordered the Tagliatelle pasta with sausage, tomatoes, and goat cheese. Not being a big goat cheese fan unless I'm in Paris, the giant glob of cheese was a little intimidating but easily defeated. I looooove basil so it was a phenomenal recipe. 
I am so impressed with this place. Expensive yes, but you get what you pay for. Not to mention the patio and seating area is gorgeous. As I read in a previous entry--its the type of environment that could be perfect for a proposal or just having drinks with friends.
