SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ I was visiting from TX and made a reservation through yelp, and it worked well! We were seated right away, but it probably took around 15 minutes to be waited on--just to order some waters. Our waitress continued to take an extremely long time to come back with our bread, take our order, bring our food out, refill our drinks, and then bring us the bill. We wound up using whoever we could grab. The food was pretty good (had the meatloaf, pork chop, and the salmon), but the service was terrible. I will not return. 
Also, they have koi fish in a fountain that is way too small for them! They were trying to jump out the whole time we sat there. Sad!
