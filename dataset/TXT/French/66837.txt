UpEVdq_euH-5mqCIgUAd2Q We have been meaning to try this restaurant for 20 years now. The new location on Front St is warm and stylish with lots of character. Service was friendly, restaurant was moderately busy. Our apps and dinner was good! We had the the onion soup, caesar salad, steak with fries and salmon. 

Thank you for the nice evening. We will be back!
