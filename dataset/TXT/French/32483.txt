gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg Les 3 Brasseurs is a small brewpub chain in Montreal with about 5 locations, with a  new location coming soon in Toronto. They brew 4 main beers, a white, a blonde, an amber, and a brown. They also do quite a few beer cocktails. It sort of reminds me of a French-Canadian version of BJ's Brewhouse in the US. One of their specialties is called a "flamm," which is more like an Alsatian tart than a pizza. These are pretty good, with mostly local cheeses and fresh ingredients as toppings, and with a thin pastry-like crust. They also make dessert flamms. In addition to flamms they have bistro fare, as well as sandwiches, burgers, salads, etc. We stopped by their Ste-Catherine location for lunch one day and each got a sampler of their beers. Vince got a québécoise flamm and their house specialty beer-braised pork shank. I got an order of duck terrine and the mussels provençale. The servings were huge, so it was way too much food. It was all pretty good, but not remarkable. I did like the flamm quite a bit. Service was friendly, and there was a festive sports bar type of atmosphere. I don't feel the need to go again, but it's not bad for some simple, reliable food. I'd probably have given it 4 stars if it didn't pale so much next to all the other excellent places I ate in Montreal.
