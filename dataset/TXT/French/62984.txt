SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA Went to happy hour (only available in the bar area). The hostess was very accommodating and put a couple of tables together for our party of 5. The blood orange champagne cocktail was disappointing. We also ordered kir royales that were better but not on the happy hour list. As a group we tried most items. The goat cheese tart was more like a slice of frittata. I expected it to be more of a savory item but there was a strong lemon infusion. The fried cauliflower was huge but flavorless. Good reviews about the pizza and burger, but I didn't try these. The honey almond cake was more like a strawberry short cake with cream, the cake was dry. Gave it 2.5 stars for the ambiance and service alone.
