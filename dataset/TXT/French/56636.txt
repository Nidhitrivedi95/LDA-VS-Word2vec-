rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I am a person who really cares about location. The location was pretty puzzling and quite exclusive in my opinion. You really had to know where you're going to find this place. Had to go through a little maze (if you will) to get here. 

The atmosphere is nice and it is pretty loud and energetic. I enjoy a more peaceful brunch so it was not too appealing to me at first. The view from the restaurant is pretty great and it is the Venetian so the architecture of the restaurant was great.

Our waitress was unfortunately extremely unfriendly and did not offer the caliber of service I would expect from the hotel. Usually, hotel restaurants offer amazing service and crappy food and charge you $$$$ for it. Here, the service was definitely unacceptable, but the food was delicious. The sandwiches here are out of the world, the fries here gave me heart burn which means its awesome, and the potatoes are wickedly delicious. 

Will I come back? YES! I will be coming back to see whether or not they have improved their service because I would say that this would've been an amazing experience if not for the poor service.
