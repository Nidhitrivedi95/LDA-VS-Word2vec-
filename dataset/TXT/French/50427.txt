ovtlrcsVRlgZZQUlHs_ovw Went on a weekday around 2:30 pm. Place was completely empty. Nice atmosphere and attentive service. I had the bruschetta appetizer which was excellent! As a previous yelper wrote, it was just two pieces but they were great and the flavors were unique and perfect together. I'd get it again. 

I asked for a vanilla latte which the waiter said he could make even though it wasn't on the menu. It came with no vanilla. When I asked about it (new waiter since they must change shifts about 3:00) she said they don't have vanilla and she brought me sugar instead. Not a big deal but I wouldn't have ordered it except he said he could make it. The coffee is good but I'd be just as happy at Starbucks for the price and it was pretty small (I'm guessing 8 oz). 

Be prepared to wait a bit for your food. Not a huge wait but you wouldn't want to come here for your lunch break. 

The salmon was ok. Just ok. It lacked flavor and was chewy like chicken rather than moist, flaky and buttery how I prefer. I've had better salmon but it wasn't so bad I didn't eat it. The sweet potatoes that came with it were very good. Wish there were more of them. The salad was also excellent and I love the dressing although I'm not usually a vinegar fan. 

The creme brûlée was great! I'm picky about my creme brûlée and the top was glassy and perfect, the custard rich and smooth without being overly sweet. The chocolate cake is VERY rich; almost like a cross between a brownie and fudge. Very tasty.  The waitress brought fresh silverware for dessert...thank you!

Really...everything was fantastic except for my salmon. 

I would come back again and try something else. This place is certainly worth the second chance.
