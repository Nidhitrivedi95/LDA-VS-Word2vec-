KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA It was just ok.  Everyone goes on about the view and location, but honestly your view is of people's backyards and that was a turn off for me.  Also, it's in a strip mall.  
I ordered the Red Win Braised Beef with White Truffle Grits.  Sound good right?  No.  The beef itself was just ok.  Very tender, but it was missing flavor.  The grits were super grainy and had ZERO flavor and did not refectory white truffle at all...AT ALL.  I've had grits before and when done correctly is very creamy and should not be grainy.  

Overall, I wasn't impressed. It's good for a nice dinner and you don't want to leave your neighborhood, but I live in Henderson and I would never drive out that way just for Marche Bacchus.  Sorry.
