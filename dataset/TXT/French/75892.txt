ynYEgNimJOyb8dvyr9x0sA My in-laws suggested meeting here for dinner. What a nice surprise! None of us had eaten her before, so the menu was a bit scary at first. After talking with our server, Sam, she helped clarify things for us so we could try some things we might like. First off we tried the salmon "pizza" crepe. It was very good, as long as you like capers, which I do. Then we tried the the chicken and mushroom crepe, also a great choice! We felt pretty full after that, so we went straight to dessert... Carmel fondue. What can I say about this? Delicious!! 
What I liked most about this place is that it is so different from everyday restaurants. If you want a burger and fries this isn't the place for you. But if you want a nice atmosphere and something new, this is a place to try.
