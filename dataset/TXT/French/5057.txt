Our server was patient, and seemed to really enjoy what she did. Friendly, elegant and observant.  

Each course arrived in a timely manner and was well thought out and tasty. The cheeses especially were excellent, as was the port that was served with it. 

The decor was inviting and cosy, with beautiful flowers everywhere. A lovely jem on the west side of King.
