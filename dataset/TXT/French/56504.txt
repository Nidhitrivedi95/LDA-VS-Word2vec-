rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Let me preface this by saying I was expecting to have my tastebuds blown out the back of my head. I came here starving and psyched for pastries. My usual "everything is awesome" standards were as low as they get, and I was just selectively impressed at best.

The good: nice location, great beer on tap, IF THE FRENCH TOAST WAS A RELIGION I WOULD CONVERT. There was "a lot" of service, but they weren't as prompt as I would've hoped and forgot my beer list. They did scrape the crumbs off our table, which I guess was a nice touch. The mixed drink we ordered was also exceptional. 

The "bad": most of these things weren't terrible, just completely out of place at a restaurant of this caliber: The bread. The bread was tough, unflavorful and overall mediocre. And by this I mean the Baguette, the Croissant, and even the Beignets aren't the best I've had. I expected to be awed by the bakery confections and I was not. Bobby Flay's Mesa grill is a Southwestern Restaurant, their baked goods were dramatically better. The side bacon was solid, the salad my wife got was good, just nothing worth raving about.

I've had much better breakfasts for half the price. $120 for two after tip.
