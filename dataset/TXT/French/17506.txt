9n6BBipidP5Eyb9xGrS0Ww What's the deal with gluten free crepes in Montreal.... it was hard to find non buckwheat crepes. Anyway, there were 5 of us and we shared 2 crepes - one apple, pear, and caramel and the other apple maple...  it was weird, both fruits were mashed and warm (like applesauce)... not what I was expecting. The apple/pear one was by far the better choice due to the caramel. The crepes weren't the most amazing in the world, but if you're in the area, they aren't bad.
