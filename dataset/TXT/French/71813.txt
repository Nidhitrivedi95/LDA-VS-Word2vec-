The service was appropriately condescending for a French-styled place, but the ambiance is nice - a converted wine-cellar restaurant that has outdoor cafe seating in season and pleasant open high ceilings and wood decor inside. I can't comment on the entire menu but the starters we ordered were tasty if not transportive. Expensive for the fare offered, though, in my humble opinion; I'd expect three-star (Michelin-guide style) food for the five-star prices.
