jo4KmAqlZ7vxjHIP7IIkAw I haven't been here in years, I first discovered this place back when they were located in the heart of Kensington market with my friend Rick the owner of Boots Bar. Now that goes back a ways. I loved it then and I love it now. Very remarkable that they have been around all these years. They must be doing something right.
