And the inside , with huge tree and other slightly over the top decorations give the place a glamourous glitzy feel that you don't see too often. A great place to take parents or inlaws for afternoon tea after a bit of shopping as well as later in the day for a drink or a light meal. It is a must to drop in sometime over December just to admire the decorations.
