pKiSzUlBBRNEdTML24piXA Bad service.  We were two of four people in the restaurant and they took fifteen minutes just to serve us drinks.  It took almost an hour to get our food!  The food was not good!  EXTREMELY SALTY and the chicken tasted like it was the pre-cooked stuff you get at a grocery store.  Also, expensive for the portion you get.  Will never go back.
