kGOr_D-LNpgZ2M9N8TT4QQ We were at La Société this past Saturday for brunch. Things started off well as our reserved table was ready and was nicely located. We had a good view of the main room, which is sadly, the only reason to visit, I found. It took about 10 minutes for our waiter to appear, but that was fine, as we were 3 friends catching up on each other's news. A waiter did appear finally, and orders placed. Two of our group ordered the mushroom and cheese omelette, which was described as being accompanied by a pear and frisee salad. However, when the dish arrived, the "salad" was nothing more than a garnish of a few slivers of pear so small it was impossible to determine the variety, and a few sprigs of the baby endive on top of the omelette (it did look pretty!) The smallish omelette contained about 4 slices of mushroom with a bit of cheese. Otherwise it was nicely cooked, although very bland. Half of the plate was covered with potatoes too salty to eat. The waiter eventually reappeared for coffee but didn't ask how our meals were, and it was ages before he reappeared to refill coffee cups. I never did get more water to rehydrate myself after trying 2 or 3 of the potato bits. I certainly don't mind paying the prices asked for good food and good service, but La Société provides neither. It instead seems to be a place where you can be seen, and to say that you've been!
