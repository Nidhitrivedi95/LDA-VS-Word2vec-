XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q I've been to many Michelin star restaurants around the world and this one compares to one of my favorite ones in Paris. Being in Vegas, it's very close to home and a wonderful departure from many of the restaurants on the west coast. 

The Chef at this location was wonderful in accommodating my dairy free and gluten free needs without compromising taste. It was such beautiful presentation and did not lack in anything. I had to ask servers to refill my tea a few times and that shouldn't happen at any restaurant. 

Service at times was slow which was a bit unimpressive considering the price per person but overall what an experience. 

There are options where you can do $445 menu which is 17 courses and ranges all the way down to 3 courses as well which is around $150. 

We did the 5 course menu which was perfect and with the amuse bouche it came out to about 8 total courses which was over a course of 3 hours and with wonderful company, the three hours flew by. 

My counterpart had a meat centric meal which he loved and had dessert that looked like it was transported from space and each was better than the course before. 

Lovely place - just be prepared to spend some moolah and a lot of your time.
