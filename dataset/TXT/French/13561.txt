4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw This is one of my favorite spots in Las Vegas and have been here many time sometimes more than one time in a day.

This was not the greatest showing. We started with the scallop gratinee which is normally kissed by heat so that the scallops are tender and perfectly cooked. They were hammered. It was like they maybe sat under a heat lamp or spent too much time in the salamander. When we notified our waiter he then made himself scarce the rest of the night and didn't offer any resolution. 

Our next course was the kale and frisée salad with a poached egg on top. This was delicious. The salad has bacon, a small amount of refreshing vinaigrette that cut through all the fat. It was really delicious.

Our main course was the lamb t-bone. It was well cooked and the cauliflower gratin was amazing. 

When we switched between courses we switched wines and the waiter didn't switch glasses. It was disappointing. 

Hopefully this was an anomaly.
