_T7f2wUgNlJqxsR-cR89SQ A friend of mine included Scaramouche in his list of possible Michelin Star contenders in Toronto, alongside the likes of Alo and Chabrol. My expectations were set pretty high, and they didn't come close.

I'm giving four stars simply because I feel it's unfair to give any decent fine dining establishment a three-star rating. With that said, I wouldn't recommend it, nor was I blown away by the food or service.  

The venue and atmosphere, however, were impressive. It's in a very unassuming old condo building, so when you walk into the actual restaurant you'll be pleasantly surprised. 

Our server was, frankly, very poor. My sister asked to try wine that he recommended and he declined. I am flour free (not gluten free) and asked if there was a substitute for a specific part a dish, and he recommended another dish. He eventually made accommodations, but took awhile to understand. We also waited extensively to take our orders, and we weren't asked once how our meal was. He kept trying to up-sell us wine, and it just became awkward. Perhaps he was new, but these are the little things you expect at a fine dining establishment.

We had the lobster, the scallops, and the filet mignon. The lobster was a bit cold and not super flavourful, the scallops were nice but not extraordinary, the filet mignon was good. The potatoes with the filet mignon were outstanding, as was the sauce and beans. 

I'm aware I'm being very critical, but if I was the owner I'd want to hear about these experiences, and do whatever I could to improve them.
