htQgj-ANQpZGpIpkkrEmyQ I haven't a clue why this place gets such high ratings.  Maybe because it's in Markham, where it's food is unique to the area.  But the food is average at best.  The service is average.  They are overpriced and they nickel and dime you as much as possible.  You want extra mayo?  You will be charged.  They count newborns as part of the party, so the can auto gratuity you for 18%
