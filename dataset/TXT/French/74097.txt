xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g BEST restaurant-seating-view in the city! Went here for our anniversary trip (Christmas time!! The BEST) and requested a window seat. The food was fab (Chicken-Parmesan Dish) and the view was amazing! Got to watch the wonderful Christmas-Music-Themed-Bellagio Fountain show. Be jealous ;P
