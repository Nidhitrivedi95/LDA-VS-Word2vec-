LQ_gYNs5E10IGFE0NOyD7A After reading some great reviews, I really wanted this place to be amazing and expected it to be pretty good.

We came here on a whim late Sunday afternoon around 4 pm for a late lunch/early dinner. As soon as we entered, we were handed menus presumably by the manager and told they were only serving half of their happy hour items - the dinner menu wouldn't be available for another hour and the other happy hour items, they were out of. 

Since my fiance was absolutely starving, we decided that we'd stay and find something from the limited menu to order. 

From my 5 or so options, I took the the pork tacos, while my fiance took the ribs. We weren't impressed with either one. My pulled pork was pretty dry and lacked flavor... his ribs were about the same. 

Along with a SUPER limited food menu, the beer list wasn't anything impressive. I think I counted 8 beers listed.

We left regretting going there and didn't understand why the dinner menu wasn't being served yet. Most of the items on the dinner menu wouldn't seem to take a lot of prep work.. I remember seeing salads, simple burgers/sandwiches

We ended up eating somewhere else after we left for a real dinner. Won't return, but glad we tried it out.

My advice - if you're going to serve an already super limited menu, make sure the food tastes amazing. Otherwise, give your patrons options regardless of if they're dining at 4pm (when you open) or 9pm.
