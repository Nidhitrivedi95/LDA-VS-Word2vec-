rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Wanted to try this place for dinner but a stupid company decided to host an event that night and took over the entire restaurant, and ruined my plans. I can't name any names but it rhymes with Lymantec and they make crappy antivirus software.  I managed to eat breakfast the next day and ordered the croque madame which was very good. Next time I stay at the Venetian I will try dinner.
