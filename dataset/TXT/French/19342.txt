aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw My sister and I were in Vegas last weekend. I have to be honest and say this place was a let down. I'd read many reviews and looked over a lot of pics and got excited to try something sweet. The treats we bought did not live up to the expectations. 

We each got a macaron and croissant. The macaron tasted like it was stale. Like, the taste something gets when it's left in the fridge for too long and is an absorbent type food. I got the apple croissant and thought it was way too dry. My sister had the chocolate croissant and thought the same thing. 

It was kind of a pain to get to, so this is a spot I'll not waste time on next time I'm in town.
