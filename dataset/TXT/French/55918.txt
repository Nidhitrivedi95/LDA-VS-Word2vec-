rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Not impressive. Went for dinner maybe hats the issue. All the pics I see on Yelp were at brunch time. I was so excited to go to this Thomas Keller restaurant but everything was so mediocre. Snails were extremely small and the croissant toppers were stale. Salmon tartar was ok needed salt. Steak was ordered medium rare and had to be sent back. Chocolate dessert was too rich and not flavorful. So all in all a bad experience.
