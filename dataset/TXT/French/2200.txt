0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g Seriously - probably one on the best dinners my wife and I have ever had - seriously!

We chose the Prix Fixe menu that included the Lobster Salad, Pan Seared Scallop, Foie Gras, Colorado Lamb - all delicious - I could have had an entire plate of the Scallop and Foie Gras for dinner - they were that good.

Not only was the food fantastic - but the service was 5 star.  Our captain Roger was such a  knowledgeable professional.  He took us thru every wine pairing - explaining what accents/notes/flavors we should be looking for in the food and the wine.

Speaking of wine - Robert - the sommelier - was outstanding.  Helping us pair wines with the prix fixe - that were outside of the wine pairing option.  Everyone of his picks hit it out of the park.

All I can say is "fantastico!" - when back in Vegas - I'm coming back to Picasso.

My wife and I thank you for such a memorable night !
