nkHaix6KenApS8M-liZsCQ Love the food and the Ambience.  The staff is awesome...and really have a terrific sense of humor...along with the chefs.  I love sitting at the bar which circles the open kitchen and talking to the chefs as they prepare the food.  This is truly a mouth watering experience from beginning to end and they know just how to do it up right.  Now that we have been there several times...it's hard going anywhere else.  I love the way they do the roasted bell pepper soup...along with the duck and rib eye..and the raspberry soufflé....I can't resist going much longer than a week.  It's a totally hip little place with trendy jazz oozing from the speakers.  All  in all a great place to feel special inside and out with your squeeze.
