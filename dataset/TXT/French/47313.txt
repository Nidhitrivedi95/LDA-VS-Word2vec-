O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q Had a great meal in June 2008. So went back last Friday November 7th. Restaurant was only 20 full at 6pm. Waiter took over 20 minutes to bring our menus. Took drink and wine order. Then came back with another waiter named Jesus. Said he was leaving and Jesus was the best waiter in the restaurant. We gave Jesus our order. Salad and appetizer came....no bread....we asked for some...water glass empty...Jesus said I will be right back with water...15 minutes later we asked the bus boy for water...had to pour our own wine. Entrees came....gummy  fatty short ribs - horrible. Very good Mahi Mahi en cellophane...still no service...about 20 wait staff were standing around talking, restaurant had only 6 tables of diners on a Friday night. No excuse for this horrible service. Any hoo, our first waiter (thought he had to leave) came back to ask how Jesus had done (while I got the check for $185+ for two). I told him this was the absolute worst service I have EVER had in any restaurant in the USA and Europe and NO TIP was coming out of my pocket. I am a very loyal diner which is why I came back to Morels.. What a major and EXPENSIVE disappointment. I would never go back. There are a billion dining opportunities in Las Vegas. THE BEST VALUE IS LUNCH AT THE PALMS IN THE FORUM SHOPS.  Great value $19.50 for huge salad, filet mignon with mushrooms, fresh hot potato chips and hash browns and coffee. Served until 3 pm every day!!
