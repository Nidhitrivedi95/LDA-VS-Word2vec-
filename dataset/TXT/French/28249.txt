eb7wb5yABe12tSoeCpLSbw Top notch restaurant. My wife is a chef and we love finding great places to eat. The service here is impeccable and the food is delicious. The interior looks a bit dated and most of the customers are elderly, but those are stupid reasons to knock the restaurant. Our waitress Helen was extremely attentive and kind, adding a nice French touch to the evening. She even sang happy birthday to a customer with an angelic voice. I've been here twice and both times were excellent. Highly recommended
