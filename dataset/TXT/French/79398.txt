Zl6csaZ5HBka3SKBphHXrQ Came here for lunch today. It does not look like much but my pasta was fantastic! I had the seafood fettucini and the flavours were really good! Hearty, flavourful, depth, complexity. Seafood was also delicious. Serving was more than adequate. And best of all, the price was very reasonable, around $13. The Caesar salad looked amazing too. Would definitely come back and try more of their dishes!
