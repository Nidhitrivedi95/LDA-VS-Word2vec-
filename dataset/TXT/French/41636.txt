kKC7UTcHZM3zLfT97x3msg This was one of the best restaurant experiences I have had in Toronto in a long time.  Although the prices were high, every item on the menu was intriguing, which is always exciting when you want to try everything that they have. All of their ingredients are fresh and everything is made in house (including the pasta, which I had specifically asked about).  The servers knew how to cater to you and make sure it was an exceptional experience.  I had the lobster ravioli and for my main I had elk loin wrapped in foie gras and truffles.  It was absolutely delicious and rich.  For my cocktail, I had the Butter Rum Tart, which tasted like a butter tart and got me pretty tipsy and set me up for a fantastic meal.  The additional treats were the fresh baked rolls, the amuse buche (mushroom soup and a salsa with deep fried goats cheese), the palet cleanser (a sorbet of sangria), and the complementary desert of fresh donuts and chocolate.  There was nothing I could have criticized about this meal at all.  I was not expecting what was provided and that was also what gave this trip the five stars.  Don't expect too much and get blown away by the experience.
