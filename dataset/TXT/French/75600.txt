YDb78yqVp5Dyx7zVr4POvA We arrived early for our seats at the Kitchin and stopped on in here for a quick glass of wine. We had wished we had found this place earlier.  The interior was extremely comfortable and they had a fantastic selection of European wines. They also had a very quaint outside over-looking the river.  The staff was helpfully to assist us in picking our wines, since we are from the states and not versed in the region based naming of their wines. I noticed they had a selection of foods and desserts, but did not consider them since we were about to go to dinner next.  I wished I had more time in Edinburgh because I would have liked to ate here, so if I am lucky and get to visit Scotland again I will definitely stop on in.
