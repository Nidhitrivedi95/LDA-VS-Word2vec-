A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g Awesome Macaroons!!!  This local French bakery is one of my favorites in town.

They have a lot of great tasting pastries and baked goods.  The macaroons are the best thing there in my opinion, the pistachio flavored ones are great.  The chocolate pistachio, salted caramel, coffee, and chocolate flavors are good as well.  The strawberry and orange ones are a bit sweet in my opinion.

For cakes, they have a good Black Forest cake and Tiramisu that are good.  The chocolate peanut butter cookie is also a pleasant surprise.  They also have a good mini chocolate croissant.

Their restaurant section is also pretty good, but I recommend their baked goods.

Service here is great, during their busy times extra people from the back usually come out to help so you don't have to wait as long.
