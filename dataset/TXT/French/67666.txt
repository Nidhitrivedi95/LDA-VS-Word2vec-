UxWH8zRYIBgs6Q2oykvRdw We often considered Cluny but never officially stopped in until today. I was anticipating classic French refinement in a casual bistro atmosphere. My expectations were not met, unfortunately. The decor is great, the patio is charming, the staff are friendly, but the food missed the mark for me and my partner.

We had the Marrakech chicken salad (the highlight) the shore lunch (nicely battered and perfectly cooked white fish paired with cold, hard shoestring frites), and the beef poutine (just ok and waaaay too much cheese).  For the price and all the hype, I expected Le Select quality. This is not a true French bistro. I don't normally order poutine in a French style, nor would a proper French establishment ever put poutine on the menu, unless they were raising the "poutine bar".  I regretted my choice after the first bite. Coming from Quebec, I've had a wide range of styles and flavours, and this was just a big glob of gravy and cheese over shoestring frites. Not worth the money (or the cheat day).
