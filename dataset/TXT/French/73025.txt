XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q We had the most amazing 3 1/2 hour  dinner. 
I'm not a  French aficionado or a Foodie, but wow.
The King Crab and octopus salad was out of this world
I had a fish entree. cooked to perfection

I  think I enjoyed the desert the most . Just when you think that it's over a cart is brought  to your table and they offer you every imaginable truffle. So Delicious.

If you get a chance to have dinner here go for it  this is a great experience.
