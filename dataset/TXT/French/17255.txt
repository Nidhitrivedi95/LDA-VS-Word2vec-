Our waiter was very attentive and courteous. We started with the Escargot appetizer, which we were not impressed. We were expecting a parsley garlic butter sauce which is how it was served at every restaurant in Paris (if you want to be authentic) Snails were presented out of the shell. My wife had the steak tartare with a side of their frites (French fries), again not impressed. We were informed there were no quail eggs, or any eggs for that matter. Their was something off about the tartare maybe the pine nuts. I had the Moroccan Lamb shank which was pretty good. Meat was tender, sauce and flavors were well balanced. Overall not a bad experience. We would like to visit this place again, but maybe try something else next time.
