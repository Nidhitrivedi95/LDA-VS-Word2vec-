uP3H5bcsiTXM0k0xQhRndg This is amazing French cuisine! I went for the first time on a Wednesday night while visiting Montreal on business. Not too crowded and I waited perhaps 10 minutes to be seated. Service was quick though and very friendly. I had the Mac and Cheese with Xmas Ham and it was phenomenal. It is filing though and 3/4's of the way through I knew dessert was out. The Le Troudu Diable McTavish IPA was an excellent IPA. It's apparently from a local micro brewery. Wonderful food, good price, good service, would highly recommend.
