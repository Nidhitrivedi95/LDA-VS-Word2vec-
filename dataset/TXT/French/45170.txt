mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q Great meal with fantastic service! What else can you ask for? We were seated at the center of the bar overlooking the open kitchen. I would definitely suggest the bar for great entertainment value as you watch the chefs go to great lengths for perfection on a plate. I was impressed that they actually took out tweezers just to move one little crumb. 

My husband and I did the Seasonal Discovery Menu. The only decision we had to make was either quail or hanger steak for one of the courses. We got 1 of each and both agreed that the hanger steak was our favorite. His favorite course of the night was the seared duck foie gras. It was pretty dang perfect with the searing on the outside and smoothness on the inside. I absolutely loved the roasted king crab over spiced eggplant soup. Two of my favorite things in 1 dish is just heaven. We also got the wine pairing and I would highly suggest it as we had 5 wines throughout the evening with very generous pours.
