WOd8tWsh2Yt_osHv-ngx_w As a brunch person, this place was worth it. 

It was the last morning we were in Montreal so we decided to use the time to explore the area near our B&B before we drove off. We explored McGill, Mount Royal a bit and decided we wanted a decent place to eat. We didn't know the area so well and didn't want to settle for some food place at the university. Thank to Yelp, I found this place nearby with lots of great reviews! I can see why. 

If I was a student at McGill, I feel I'd be coming here for brunch quite a bit! The restaurant was quite busy, and we did not have to wait in line so long. Probably because people were leaving at the time we arrived. 

The portions were big (especially the salads so be prepare if you order one)! So much, we were not able to finish our meal. I really don't suggest eating before coming here. Service was great, despite the business and would definitely recommend it if anybody was looking for a good brunch place :)
