4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw We made it for my favorite time, BRUNCH!
   Anyways, we requested outside seating.. 35 min wait, no problem. We finally got seated but it was very tight. Meaning if u needed to get up and walk-by or scoot over, it would be a problem. It was very busy but a restaurant should never try to cramp up tables close to one another... Eventually the manager came out and asked if my husbands friend can move his seat because he is clearly in the way of all the servers, because they need to get through to bring out plates. 
     Our friend was completely upset due to the such request, while looking at other tables, there was a few that could've moved around to accommodate our needs, but instead they decided to single us with an improper demand. The manager said we can provide another table, in which we agreed... BUT we had to get up and wait outside or by the bar... Why? Just get the other table ready and then we will move to it.. we already had drinks and an appetizer out... It looked like she was bothered by the response and obviously my husband friend was not so happy. He became the bigger person and moved and we just decided to stay at our table where the sun was hitting 50% of our table. 
      The food food finally came out. I ordered the salmon salad. It tasted very plain, I wish it had a dressing to add flavor but it didn't , it was perfectly cooked though. My husband is a huge Benedict lover so that's what he ordered. He said it lacked a lot of flavor and he was not to happy that they pair it with sweet tomatoes for the side. It's weird that back then from looking through images for the side it was hash brown and veggies.. idk maybe they ran out and that's why he got that? 
      We enjoyed our conversations but it began to get annoying when we are getting looked at or asked if we need anything else when we are still working on our drinks.. like yes I know people are waiting but you still have customers eating and paying!
