UWupVhvb1qWZh8rNowJliQ Went here for my boyfriends birthday. Service was terribly slow. 
Food was ok. Small portions. I found the duck ($28) too salty. Steak ($35) was excellent. 
When I mentioned it was his birthday to the waiter he responded 'Ya' then walked away  he later handed us the desert menus. I asked for the bill from another waiter and told him about the experience and he brought us doughnuts and desert drinks to make up for it. Desert was really good.  

Overall, food ok (not worth spending the $ for a return) and service super slow but they tried to fix in the end.
