rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Bouchon: Poor Man's French Laundry. 
I dined here in hopes of tasting Chef Thomas Keller's creativity. But unfortunately, this is a French Bistro, nothing really gets to wild here. 
My motto for this place is "Simple Food, Cooked To Perfection". 
The food is overpriced, but in Vegas, all food is overpriced. 
The dishes were absolutely Delicious and seasoned to perfection. They were hardy cafe fare that would be seen in Paris. 

It's classy place with a Raw bar, where 19 year old culinary students shuck oysters all day. 

Recommended to all who have money to throw around on a good dining experience.
