Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA We stopped in at MIX on for my Bachelorette party.  This place was a ton of fun!  We danced and drank for hours!  The view from this bar was absolutely insane.  The pictures from that night were top notch.  Also to note:  The bathroom stalls look out over the strip which give a unique experience!
