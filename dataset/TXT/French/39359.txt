jSfnItqaOnEp2nenVF7fCg Lovely little restaurant, lovely little surprise.  What a nice way to have lunch after a day of exploring out west.  Although small and in a strip mall, once inside you are in a charming red "bistroish "  cafe. The style is warm and the food is delicious. 

I  highly recommend the Lamb Panini  super good, moist  and flavorful. 
The Fish And Chips special was tasty too. The fish and fries both appeared to be beer battered .  Generous portions and great taste. Can't wait to go back.
