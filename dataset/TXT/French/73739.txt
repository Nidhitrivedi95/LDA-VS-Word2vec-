xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g This was the best meal that I can remember! I brought my love here on a date while here in Vegas. I made the reservation well in advance a must for any of the nicer restaurants out here, and the only way to get a coveted window seat! I chose to have roses waiting for her at the table, which can be added to the dinner bill, and they were nicely arranged in a glass vase and sitting among a classy place setting. We had a beautiful view of the strip, the Bellagio fountain in particular. After we were served bread and a delightful fresh soup (chilled tomato with watermelon- I was terrified; but it was terrific!) She ordered the Beef Wellington with snap peas, I had the free range chicken with artichokes two ways, and we shared some potatoes gratin. For desert we had the pistachio soufflé. All of the food was perfectly prepared and gorgeously plated. The service was fantastic. The restaurant was beautiful and the view was stunning. I had an amazing time. The only caveat would be that it is pricey, but judging from my experience worth every penny!
