58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw I wanted to love this place, and based on all the positive Yelp reviews I thought I would, but it was mostly just average. 

We got there for brunch around 10:30am on a Sunday morning and the line was already well out the door for a table, so I would suggest getting there early. We got lucky and since all the people ahead of us were parties of 3 or more and we were just 2, we got to jump the line and only waited about 15 min total. 

I had the scrambled egg with asparagus and chedder on toast, with fruit and potatoes. The egg was actually pretty good, but the toast was a bit burned and too crispy. The fruit was fresh and enjoyable. As for the potatoes, I generally love potatoes made any way, but I didnt like them at all and only ate a bite. Im not sure why you would cook potatoes in duck fat, because it mostly left them just tasting weird and too sweet (to me, Im aware other reviewers loved them).  

Overall it was an acceptable breakfast, but I wouldnt go back. Breakfast is usually my favorite meal, and I love breakfast foods, but there just wasnt anything here to make me want to come back.
