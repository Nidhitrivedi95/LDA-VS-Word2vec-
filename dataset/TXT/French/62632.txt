SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ Everything about this place is amazing.  We were in town for the Ironman and decided to come here for dinner one night.  It's such a sweet place, beautifully laid out and decorated, lovely ambiance.  It feels small and cozy, but it seems like they have a lot of seating areas.  We wanted to sit outside, so we grabbed a table at the outside bar area.  Service was very prompt, and everyone was super nice and friendly.  Food was absolutely incredible.  We started off with the bread and ahi tuna, then had the tenderloin and poached ono for our main courses, and finished with the salted caramel bread pudding.  So delicious.  I kind of want to go back to Tempe just to go back here for dinner.
