P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ We dined at Guy Savoy in a group of 4, and we ordered the 14-course Innovation-Inspiration Menu. The restaurant has a very nice ambience and our waitress and sommelier were both very courteous and knowledgeable. All 14 dishes were very well prepared, but my absolute favorite was the black truffle cromesqui which was very rich in flavor. I would also recommend saving some room for the dessert cart at the end of the dinner as all the dessert dishes were absolutely amazing. Although I've always wanted to try out Robuchon, I was sure glad that we've dined at Guy Savoy during our Vegas trip.
