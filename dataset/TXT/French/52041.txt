The upstairs space is small--looking essentially like a converted private dining room--with a small bar at one end and probably five or six "table equivalent" seating areas.  The lounge was largely empty, with just one other group sitting down to enjoy some drinks.  One fellow even came in, was seated, and left after a minute because it was so dead and uncomfortable.  The environment isn't even as posh as one might expect from a Las Vegas Strip cigar and cognac lounge.  The addition of some high-backed leather chairs could probably give it more of "salle privée" feel, but it seems like the space is holding out for some dream of attracting a more raucous, "bottle service" type crowd.  Casa Fuente in the Caesar's mall has a much better atmosphere, albeit in less sophisticated surroundings.

On the upside, the collection of drinks is truly impressive and the display cabinet is worth checking out.  Service is extremely helpful and not at all pretentious: the server was more than happy to make some suggestions to a cognac novice and even recommend some of the value offerings (as it is extremely easy to get lost in some very large numbers on the cognac menu).  The friendly service and impressive drink collection are the only things that save the lounge from a two-star or even one-star review.  The ventilation system is top notch, preventing the room (if it ever did get crowded) from becoming too stuffy.  It actually might be too effective, as you'll likely either feel the air currents or at least see them affecting the smoke from your cigar.
