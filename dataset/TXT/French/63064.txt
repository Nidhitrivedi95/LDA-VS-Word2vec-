SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA Food was spectacular. The escargot was flavorful, the salmon was cooked to perfection and the mussels my girlfriend had have been on my mind since I took a taste. The mushroom soup on special was spectacular, too. My only gripe at L'Albatros is that the service, at times, can be a little over the top. That's not necessarily bad, but it just seemed as if every two seconds someone was putting more bread on our plate or filling our water. It's a little distracting if you're trying to have a conversation with a small group of people. That said, still one of my favorite spots in Cleveland.

Oh, and the maple nut old fashioned was great.
