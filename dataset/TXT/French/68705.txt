vna49NPM-7B11tcFPTgnsg Oh this place is more like a 4.5 stars! If only their espresso was better (it's a tad bit on the terrible side)... The food is amazing. The open kitchen is wonderful, and you have a front seat to the kitchen at the bar. We were there when someone was being trained, and it was nice to see a patient chef teaching someone his techniques. The dessert was not bad, but a little too sweet. This place is absolutely wonderful for a small romantic dinner.
