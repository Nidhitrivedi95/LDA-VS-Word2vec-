mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q An absolutely amazing, delectable, and gorgeously presented meal...

MENUS:
$78 which includes amuse bouche, appetizer, soup, fish or meat, dessert
$105 which includes amuse bouche, appetizer, soup, fish, meat, dessert
A la carte dishes also available 

I opted for the $78 menu and ordered:
*Chicken Egg on a crispy polenta galette & black truffle ($15 supplement) - Amazingly delicious and worth paying the supplement.  The polenta was crispy, topped with a runny egg yolk and garnished with thin slices of black truffle and parmesan.  A mouthwatering dish that had me wanting more.
*Lobster bisque with asparagus - So delicious!!  The bisque was creamy with a slight lobster flavor.  Chopped up pieces of lobster and asparagus could be found as you scooped up the soup. 
*Braised beef cheeks w/carrots & red wine sauce - Delicious and extremely tender.  Mashed potatoes accompanied the dish which I thought were good, but a bit too heavy and buttery for me.
*Ice cream & sorbet - The perfect sweet and tart ending to the meal.  A small scoop of pistachio ice cream, banana ice cream, and raspberry sorbet is served on top of a few small slivers of fruit.  

WHAT TO KNOW:
*Casual dining: jeans acceptable, but presentable shoes
*Sleek modern look with tables and counter seating and an open kitchen
*Reservations can be made on Opentable, however it told us there weren't any reservations available.  We were able to get a reservation after calling L'Atelier directly
*Portion sizes are on the smaller side so order an additional dish or load up on bread
*Three different types of bread are served with a delicious butter topped with sea salt.  My favorite bread was the round flakey one. 
*Choice of still (Evian), sparkling, or tap water

SERVICE:
Great!  We had a few servers: one that took our food order and others who brought the dishes to the counter.  Our main waiter who took our order was nice, friendly, and knowledgeable of the menu.  Everyone was friendly and we were periodically checked up on.  Dishes were well timed and for our four course meal, we spent a little less than an hour and a half here. 

I definitely can't wait to come back...
