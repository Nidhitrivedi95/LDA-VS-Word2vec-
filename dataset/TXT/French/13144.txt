4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I saw all the wonderful reviews and really wanted to come here for lunch, after we had settled in.  I ordered the ham & cheese crepe, which was bleh.  It wasn't as good as I had thought, and after seeing what my friends ordered, I wished I had ordered something else instead. My friends got the salmon and another ordered the seafood platter, which both are really good.  Service was pretty bad.  It took forever to get our check, but again, it was pretty busy at the restaurant.  We wanted to sit outdoors, but it was at least a half hour wait, and at that time, we were starving as we had just came to Vegas, so we opted to sit inside instead.  I may come again, but for either brunch or dinner because the pictures looked good and I was not able to try any of those items.
