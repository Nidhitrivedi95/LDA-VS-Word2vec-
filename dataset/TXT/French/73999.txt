xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g Little late on this review, we actually did Thanksgiving dinner here.  It was the best Thanksgiving dinner I've ever had (sorry mother!).  I went with a group and we all got the Thanksgiving dinner special.  I believe it included an app, main course and a desert.  I'm not much of a wine guy but we did get whatever pairing of red wine they recommended to go with the turkey, and it was very good.  The Turkey was awesome, cooked great, some light and dark meat, some awesome stuffing, great cranberry sauce/spread.  

The thing that stood out most in my mind though was the desert.  Best pecan pie I've ever had.  Hands down.  I will have to see if they have pecan pie available next time I'm in Vegas, if they have it when you're there, I'd recommend it.  Came with a scoop of ice cream, cold ice cream with warm pecan pie, delicious.

The service was very good, atmosphere of the place, views, it was a good dining experience.  If I had to pick something I didn't like it was the lady at the podium on the ground level, when we made a reservation with her a few days before she made some condescending remarks about our dress at the time which I thought were uncalled for.  I'm not counting that as part of the dining experience though, so 5 stars from me!
