pmoIMK8zGWvKsVOPDBYfzg I thoroughly enjoyed my experience at Andre's.  I actually used a Groupon at Andre's which gave me an incredible discount there.  I order the filet of beef and prime beef carpacio which was very tender and good.  I absolutely love the French Onion soup and their field greens salad.  I did not try any wine because they were a bit overpriced by the glass but had a great selection of wines.  I would definately go there again, maybe for a special occasion.. not for daily dining.
