4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw We are used to the great service here and today's serve by Samuel went beyond words.  Very,friendly and attentive.  Checking on us at the right time to make sure each serving was the right temperature and as we liked it.  Always with a smile and genuine.  Samuel is an asset you don't find easily these days.  WOW.
