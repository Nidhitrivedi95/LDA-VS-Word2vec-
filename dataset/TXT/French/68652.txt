vLkKorA1gPS97Zj0_WKA0Q This is probably one of the most disappointing meals we've had from a chef of this high caliber.

Perhaps because the restaurant is newly opened and the menu hasn't been perfected (well, that is still no excuse for overcooking beef)?

Unlike the other low rating reviewer - service was really good for us. ambiance and table seating and arrangement was also not an issue. The only problem we had was entirely on the food.

I like the different tasting dishes but some times it felt really disjointed and confused, as if it lacked something to tie all the small dishes together.  

The langoustine tasting was quite fun and interesting. While some of the dishes were  amazing, others were like, huh? And the sake shot? I was like..hum...not sure why they are doing a shot of sake when they just sold us a bottle of really expensive wine...didn't really enhance the langoustine or the overall tasting experience. 

My husband's steak was overdone. He ordered rare, and the beef came out barely pink. We didn't want to send it back and just decided to concentrate on my venison which was prob one of the best I have ever had. 

The dessert tasting was fun and exciting. It was like a flirtatious girl all dressed up ready for a night on the town. Lots of "bling" and once again, many of the components didn't really make sense all together.

This sounds really silly, but the warm baguette served before our meal was awesome (not baked in-house...but super tasty)!

I was really hoping for so much more...
