4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Their food here is to DIE FOR!!! 

Warning...make reservations!!! My bestie, boyfriend, and I spontaneously decided to come here since we wanted to have a nice fine dining. The wait can be almost an hour (we waited for 45 min). BUT!!! If you know how to utilize your time while waiting, it will most certainly be worth it. Since the casino machines are within distance from Mon Ami Gabi, might as well gamble, right? :) 

Once seated, we were promptly served with bread and some cherry tomato and something else toppings. It was really good. 

Afterwards, we all decided to have steak dinner...hey why not? It's Vegas! :D Under the steak frites category, I ordered the "Hanger Steak", well done. As my order came, I was also served with some hand cut fries. OMG!!! IT WAS DELISH!!! I was surely satisfied with their food. Once finished with our dinner, I walked out of the restaurant as a happy person. :) 

Overall, if you ever have the chance, try eating outside in the patio area where you have a nice view of the Bellagio fountains. It is actually better at night. :D
