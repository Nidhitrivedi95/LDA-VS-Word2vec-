t1mR_Zff6Dqv1TueE2JLEA Let me start by saying the food was very good...  The service on the other hand, was pretty bad. We walked in on a Saturday night without a reservation (party of two) and were told that getting a table would not be an option. Okay, understandable. We asked if we could eat in the bar and were told sit anywhere and menus would be right over. We never saw that person again. While we waited 15 minutes for menus, three separate groups of 3-5 people came in without reservations and were seated within 15 minutes. We moved to the bar to try to get some sort of service. During a 20 minute time there waiting to order, another group of 5 was seated without a reservation. The food when we finally got it was very good. I think there was some sort of belly dancing dinner show in the actual restaurant, that sounded fun, but my wife and I wouldn't know. My wife says that, for the cost, she would not come here again because the experience of a Moroccan restaurant was not part of the price of admission because we had to eat in the bar.  Overall, outstanding food, TERRIBLE service.  What a letdown.
