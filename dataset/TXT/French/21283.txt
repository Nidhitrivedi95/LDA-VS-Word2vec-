Located in a converted house in downtown Scottsdale, this easy to miss restaurant is indeed petite.  The inside had a cozy French countryside theme.  The menu was limited.  Noteworthy dishes we ordered include a foie gras starter, diver scallops served with bacon and mustard, and the souffle.  The souffle was amazing-very light with a citrus taste.  Although the onion soup was flying out of the kitchen all night, I found it just OK.  Service was good throughout the night.
