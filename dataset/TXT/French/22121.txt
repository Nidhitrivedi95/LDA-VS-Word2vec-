BSmqxPbQglQwP2R56OqOag First time here and with all the good reviews thought we couldn't lose.  Ordered a Caesar salad, fresh romaine but no other flavor to speak of.  

Entree had the mushroom taglattlla?  It was also very bland.  Wife had another pasta dish that had noodles that where way to big for the dish I thought it did have a better flavor than my dish.. 

A lot a wine choices, and a constant flow of people.

Happy hour only at bar or in lounge.


Probably will not return
