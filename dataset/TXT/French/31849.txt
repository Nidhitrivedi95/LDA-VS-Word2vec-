Gu-xs3NIQTj3Mj2xYoN2aw I was in the plaza here because of Bruno's and me and my bf were hungry afterwards.  The options, it appeared, were either a Japanese restaurant which the counter attendant at Bruno's said was not too bad, or Maxim. Well, we searched trusty Yelp and Maxim's was described as a Cafe serving French food. That was exactly what I was craving for and so we went in.

The lady asked me, in Cantonese, how many people and I was taken aback for a quick moment. I then realized this could be the same Maxims near my home...great for cakes, but so-so on everything else.

Service is awful here, in that it is very slow. They also do forget things. We came here Saturday around 3-ish so it wasn't prime time exactly. The food on the other hand was okay. I had the chicken which was covered in a great gravy, served with crunchy green beans (just the way I like them). My bf had the fish and chips which tasted like the best microwave oven fish ever! Crispy and crunchy on the outside, and fluffy white fish meat on the inside. The fries were yummy too!

Of course, we had the cakes for dessert and my fave is the Strawberry Meringue and Strawberry Shortcake:)

Overall though, I wouldn't recommend this place if you're hungry or if you're in a rush. The good thing is if you just want to be left alone and not have server's coming to see if your cup is empty or if you want more food, then this is your place.

They do serve alcohol (white and red wine) although there is no menu for it. Also, my bf originally wanted the kids menu fish and chips portion as he wasn't hungry, but they wouldn't accommodate which meant we got the regular serving (2 HUGE pieces of fried fish).
