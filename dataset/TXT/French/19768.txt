aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw The Bouchon Bakery is located just at the foot of the main tower elevator bank at The Venetian resort.  This is a great place to grab pastries, sandwiches, drinks, and sweets so you don't max out your hotel bill with items from the mini-bar.

I usually get the Grilled Ham and Cheese Baguette, which is delicious, or the Turkey Brio sandwich.  The service is very fast and the price is reasonable.  I usually grab something here before I head out for the day so I don't get stuck somewhere without food.  It is hard to find quick food like this in Vegas.  Sometimes, I just want a sandwich without a wait and this place fits the bill perfectly.
