u-SvRRAfYgpbXZRfQgcTzA My friends brought me here in Montreal.  

I would go here for drinks and food but if you're looking for a full meal I would look somewhere else. 

The food here is TASTY.  
- Grilled steak on a stone? Super cool and the beef just melts in your mouth 
- Raw octopus salad - was hesitant at first but the texture is super fun, you have to chew it thoroughly ! I would say octopus is an experience for sure.  This one came a bit spicy which is nice with the rawness.

The atmosphere is fun here for a night out.  Everyone is so cheerful and the staff are quick to get you anything you want.  They also cheer you on as you drink ! Gan bei !
