Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA This was the worst dinner we have ever had. So, needles to say that it ruined our Valentine's Day. The food was terrible and tasted like it had been sitting out all night. Also,, we upgraded to the Vip seating for a spectacular view. Well, we were seated behind a pilar and waitstaff station. Everyone else were seated along the railing with views of the strip. We were seated behind them along the wall. While we had only the view of their tables and the wall we still had to pay the same price as them. We asked for another seat but were told that nothing else was available. Never again will I pay for anything like this. I will definitely advise people to stay away from here.
