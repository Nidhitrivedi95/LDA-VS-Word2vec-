rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I had a craving for French cuisine while in Vegas and Bouchon did not disappoint. I was excited to see that the Croque Madame was available on the dinner menu, since I had seen the pictures on Yelp and had hoped to try it. The Madame was delicious!

Among the other dishes we ordered, the salmon appetizer stood out. The service was very prompt. We never had to ask for more bread to go with the salmon spread, it just continued to arrive. 

While I felt the wine list was a bit small, I was happy with the Chardonnay that we ordered. It was rich, buttery and paired well with the dishes we ordered. 

I would definitely return and recommend Bouchon to others.
