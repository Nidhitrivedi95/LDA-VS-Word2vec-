4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Had lunch here this morning with my girlfriends and 9 year old daughter.

Hostesses were okay; they never smiled. Our server was alright; she looked like she doesn't like people that much and the food was mediocre. The best part was having seated outside the Terrace. We had a great view of the strip right across the beautiful Bellagio fountain. 

I love salmon egg Benedict. Their salmon was thin, the bread wasn't fresh but the eggs were cooked perfectly, runny just like the way I like it but it was a bit bland.

My expectation for breakfast wasn't met but I would come back here for dinner, I heard dinner here is delicious so I'll give their dinner menu a try.
