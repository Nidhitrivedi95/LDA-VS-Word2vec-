aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw Danggggggg, a chocolate croissant and a PB&J macaroon for $8?!?!?!?!! you must be sh!tting me! I all of a sudden felt ripped off but am too embarrassed to say "oh, then I don't want the chocolate croissant"

so fine. I paid it. And almost instantly regretted getting the chocolate croissant. It tasted like it's been sitting there for the entire day and was hard to bite into. Definitely not what I had dreamed of...a soft, flaky, buttery croissant :(

Thank God the Pb&J macaroon was delicious! It was chewy on the outside, peanut butter on the inside filled with strawberry jam in the center! But is this worth $3? NO WAY, JOSE! I complain when I have to pay $1.50 for a small macaroon! Now, you're just pressing my buttons. This place is a one time only deal.
