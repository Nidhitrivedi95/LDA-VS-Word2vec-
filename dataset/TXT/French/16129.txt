Alas my Dad was dead set on going here bc of his grumbling tummy and dislike for walking anymore. Finally we get seated...scarf down the bread (which was pretty yummy - nice, soft and chewy). They had this special set menu which 2 people got (appetizer of soup or salad, entree of fish, pasta, or chicken, and a desert of sorbet and cookies). I just ordered the Nicoise salad bc I wasn't too hungry and someone else got the tuscan white bean soup and salad. The food wasn't mindblowing but the key here is I think I got exactly what I paid for - hence the A-OK. It wasn't expensive, the food was tasty (I actually really enjoyed the salad and wished it was a tad bigger, the soup was a bit salty, but the pasta was yummy and the salmon was cooked well), pretty good sized portions and service (after the line) was great. Our waitress was the sweet lady who midway through our meal turned into the singing waitress...a little odd I'll admit but hey, more power to her for getting her spot of fame even if it's in a little restaurant.
