cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg Went for a special occasion dinner. The space is very loud and crowded. As an English speaker I was a bit disappointed by the service staff's ability to explain dishes (the menu is very non-descript). We had a reservation and were seated promptly at the bar (be aware that a two top with a reservation may end up at the bar). The bar is very tightly sat - and there is barely any room behind you so those with long legs may be uncomfortable. Being at the bar means you're in the thick of it - lots of banging, broken glasses, people waiting to use the bathroom or register. 

The server recommended too much food - she specifically said that the portions on two of our dishes would be very small - they were not. We're used to high-end restos serving portions that are much smaller. So that is to say, their portions are generous - but we felt bad not cleaning our plates at the end of the meal. 

Drinks:
-Cocktails are tasty but too sweet - as avid cocktail drinkers it was nice that they had 5 to choose from but they were all sweet drinks and maybe only one featured whisky which is odd considering the menu. 
-Wines by the glass were pricey - but tasty.

On to the food:
-Pate de Campagne - typical country pate, similar in flavor to many others I have had. Nothing unique flavor wise but tasty nonetheless. 
-Fois Gras Poutine - delicious FG and gravy. Rich enough to share between 2-4 people with other small plates. 
-Venison Tartare - we're big tartare fans and the flavored here did not disappoint. However, the portion was larger than any I've ever seen. It was enough for 6 to 8 people to snack off of - not the typical app size dish we're used to - perhaps this could have been explained by the server when we ordered. The accompanying salad was pretty but too oily - I didn't get a chance to ask what was in the dressing but it needed more acid to cut through the richness of the oil/fat. Either way, it was too much food and we would have rather paid $10 less for half the portion. 
-Duck in a can - one of their signature dishes. It's rather novel to have the duck poured out of a can at your seat. Flavors were savory and warming - would have been a more appropriate winter dish. The huge serving of FG included didn't hurt. Again, by this point in the meal it was just too much - too rich, too much quantity. 

Overall, the flavors were great. We could have been served half as much food and been satisfied. The service was efficient but not warm. I most likely would not return if I was paying.
