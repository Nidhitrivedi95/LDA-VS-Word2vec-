4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw My Plus1 wanted steak. I go to YELP & there are lots of places listed for $$$$ & 3/5 rating. MAG has $$ & 4/5 rating. The rating should be higher than the $s, is how I see it. Plus MAG has that magnet patio and the weather was perfect for using it. We get in line & they give us a beeper. My Plus1 goes off to play the slots in Paris Casino. I go to the restroom. Beeper goes off in about 10 minutes and we are escorted to primo patio seating, hugging the rails separating MAG from the sidewalk. I feel GAWD D** lucky, like hitting big on slots or LOTTO! Lol

Plus1 orders Steak Merlot and I order Quiche w/bacon, 2 drinks(both for me) and Country Pate. The Quiche is perfect, light the crust barely noticeable. OMG! I get some steak from my Plus1. It's good. I take a few bites but prefer my deliciously light Quiche. Plus1 takes the steak back. :-)  No room for dessert. We finish lunch about 12:45. We had planned to eat dinner but lunch last us all day. I did not even snack later. Had a few drinks later but no more food for the day. So the $80 lunch bill does not so seem excessive at all by the end of our day. Having this experience, so cheap, made it so worthwhile. 

I "HEART" MAG!
