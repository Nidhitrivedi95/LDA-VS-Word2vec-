P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ I'm glad I got to eat here as this was one of the most memorable places I've ever tried. First, in order to find the massive wooden doors that marks the entrance to this gastronomical wonderland, you have to navigate through the labyrinth that is Ceaser's Palace. Ceaser himself, armed with today's latest GPS technology, wouldn't be able to find this place (or the bathroom, for that matter).

One thing that stood out for me (besides the small chair that they have for purses) was the CARTS filled with goodness. The bread cart towered far above the tables and contained a huge variety of endless bread (that I can't remember) that was freshly baked. The champagne cart was excellent and I enjoyed the recommendation that the sommelier has made. The dessert cart was similarly filled to the brim with all types of unique desserts, and at that time I was already stuffed from the huge meal we just had.

Some stand out dishes include:
1) Artichoke and Black Truffle Soup, Toasted Mushroom Bricohe, and Black Truffle Butter - A solid foundation for the our meal. Contained huge chunks of black truffles which really made the soup memorable.
2) Crispy Veal Sweetbreads w/ Petite Potato and Black Truffle Sandwiches - Delicious and delicate, and paired well with the glass of Cab that we had
3) Roasted Baby Chicken w/ Black Truffle Potato Puree and Winter Vegetables - at this point I was too full to eat too much of this, but it was a nice touch for them to bring out the pot for you to smell before it is fully cooked.

The Chocolate Fondant and the Textures of Blood Orange were both very good. If only I was born with a larger stomach, I could have fully sampled and finished all the dishes that were presented to me. This was, so far, the best dining experience I've ever had.
