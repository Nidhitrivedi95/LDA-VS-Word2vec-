WOj8nPos3R9IIf0Pyttd8g Top notch brunch.  The French menu with a Southern influences makes me believe in miracles.  I hear the duck confit hash can heal leprosy, but they're always out when I finally make it in.  

Pretty much everything on the menu is great - order the coffee and morning fries, you won't regret it.
