ynYEgNimJOyb8dvyr9x0sA Came in for desert after Sushi, sat in the bar area then asked if we wanted to pay a five dollar cover fee to stay and listen to an old-school band, no thank you.  Went in to  main dining room and ordered desert.  I could see that our order was up yet the waiter did not notice.  By the time he came and delivered it to us the ice cream and whipped cream were melted, his response "You should have picked it up, sorry, it will be alright.  Waiter left us and we asked chef for a re-do.  Fresher desert came and it was really not a worth it in my book.  Might be back to try the Fondue or maybe try the other popular Fondue place in town.
