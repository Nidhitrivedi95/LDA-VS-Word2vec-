SCklYa_jhihWAcfIn-_chg It is true, when I feel like going for breakfast I don't necessarily want to drown myself in a grotesque plate of bacon and eggs, while some guy at the table next to mine burps out his beer from the night before. 

On these occasions, Bonjour Brioche is a good brunch option.  The place is quiet, quality, and has a lovely European feel to it.  Unfortunately with that feel comes an unfortunate attitude carried by the staff.  It is as if its patrons are American tourists barging into its Parisian idyll.  

I think next time I go there to enjoy a lovely French breakfast, I will outsmart them by speaking French.  Most likely the only French word the wait staff knows is bonjour, I'm guessing they are hard pressed to figure out what a brioche is.
