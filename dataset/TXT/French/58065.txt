rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Yes. Bouchon is a 4 star in my book. I've been here multiple times, including this morning for brunch. We had a 500ml of wine, which was perfect for me and my mom to split. I lovvvveee their salmon lox, as well as the salmon terrine that I've had several times. 

Service is always very good, not incredibly engaging, but on point and never leaving me wanting.
