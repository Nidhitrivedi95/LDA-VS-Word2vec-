4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I went on a Sunday evening and sat outside with my girlfriend for my birthday. What a view! Right on the Strip across from Bellagio's fountains and next to but safe from all the Strip activity. The appetizer with goat cheese was decadent and just the best! They had 3 different Pinot Noir wine to choose from and let me taste each one to choose. So I loved the wine, the food and the ambiance. Will definitely be going back. But I recommend Sunday evenings if you want to sit outside without waiting 3 hours lol.
