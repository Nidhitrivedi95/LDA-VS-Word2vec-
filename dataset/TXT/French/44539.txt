MhFoFpLBx_Fy8gs9dlwtGA Everything about this restaurant is average, which by Montréal standards is not very impressive.

The decor is nice, standard French bistro. The menu is prettty much exactly what you`d expect to find similar French restaurants around town. The food tasted OK. It wasn`t bad, but it wasn`t great either. I had the bavette (steak) and a cake for dessert. They messed up the cooking of the steak (they got two out of four right at our table) and took a little while to bring it back.

The service was also just OK. Not terrible but also not particularly helpful. I will not go back with all of the options in Montréal and would not recommend it to anyone.
