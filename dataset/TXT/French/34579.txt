HojKatUfX4UHWaPqtl63NQ First time here and my first impression is that the decor is a bit odd. It doesn't feel like a French restaurant. But the food certainly is. The tables by the windows, with the great view have a HUGE overhead light that should be removed. Not only does it interfere with the view but it's just too bright for dinning.

Our waiter Bianca made our experience so much more enjoyable. What a lovely, personable and professional person. She made us feel right at home.

I recommend the stripped bass, it was outstanding!
