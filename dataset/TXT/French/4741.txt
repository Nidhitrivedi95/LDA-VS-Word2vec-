The last time it was a chicken breast.  This time it was pieces of chicken fatty...grissle..hard dried end pieces..it was disgusting like they ran out and just threw it together.  The lettuce was not fresh and thrown on in clumps.  They ran out of mayo so if you didn't want Chipotle which was hot or pesto you were out of luck.  The side salad was swimming in dressing making the croissant soggy. They normally have great ones..not this time. We didn't have time to change it or address it or we would have.  We ate what we could and left.  It was $19 for a terrible lunch.
