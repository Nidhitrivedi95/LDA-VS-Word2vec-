yAkT-tNGut0rbWlA7kjrdg Agree with the above- great addition to the neighboorhood. My dad and I went together- I had a perfect little lemon and meringue tart, he had a fruit tart with strawberry and pistacio cream. Both were super tasty, just like being in France. They have loose leaf teas, which I like too. Prices were very reasonable so will definitely be returning.
