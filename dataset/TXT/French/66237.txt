UL-FJ_EMbtjfoRNA7id_Ig If I could rate this restaurant higher, I would.  The entire experience was sublime.  From the service (impeccable...friendly, knowledgeable, unintrusive), to the food (good lord...my friend and I just about fell off our chairs) to the decor and music - beautiful, understated and absolutely perfect.

I could not have asked for a better evening out if I tried.  This puts all other French restaurants in Toronto to shame.  I am so looking forward to going back next week (it was that good I need everyone I know to try it).

I couldn't be more thrilled that we have this calibre of restaurant finally opening in the east end.  I look forward to being a regular visitor!
