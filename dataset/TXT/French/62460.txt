SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ I am picky so here's my review.  The scallop appetizer was very good as well as the fois gras.  The salad we had lacked much flavor but was really fresh.  The rabbit, which was highly recommended by the waitress was just ok.  Atmosphere outside was pleasant and inside was grandma-ish.  Overall a good meal but not sure if I would return.
