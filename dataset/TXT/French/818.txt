_cjPEH9wXhKS-HQe_U3M4Q UPDATE: No more Stuffed French toast !?  this made me really sad. The online menu apparently is outdated. Which is why I removed a star....Please bring it back!!!!!



Excellent food and service. The waitress had such great attention to every detail. The bouillabaisse was different from what we had expected but it in a good way :) (though I wish they put a bit more seafood and and a bigger scallop, instead of teeny one...) 

Was very impressed with the ingredients here. The unsalted butter was extremely fresh and creamy and the risotto (we requested it to have less cheese) was not too cheesy and perfectly brothed. You can tell they are careful with sourcing the ingredients as the veggies were extremely fresh and tasty. 

Dessert was something we weren't planning to have but could not resist the lychee sorbet, passion fruit and brandy infused ice cream all made in-house. 

I will definitely be back very soon. Can't wait!!
