C6hljmEZYZw4pA0OJaFOjQ Great French style restaurant - food is hearty french, rather then fine dining but portions are huge and even during December, a three course lunch festive menu was a great £16 for three (substantial) courses. 

I ate here with three friends and we are all coeliacs. Staff were knowledgeable and told us to order what we wanted and whatever on the menu would be adapted for us which was great to hear. Sadly, there wasn't much sampling of the menu as we all wanted the same things!

Starters of a goats cheese salad was lovely - great quality goats cheese, creamy but not too salty. Our main was venison daube with mash potato (sides included were green beans, broccoli and roasted potatoes). This was amazing! An absolutely huge portion of venison (I wish I had photographed it) with the daube including mushrooms and onions. Lovely and just the ticket on a cold December Saturday. Sheer gluttony meant we ordered pudding - again we all went for a lemon posset which was creamy and tangy but with a lovely moreish sweetness. I could only manage half of mine - again, this was a big portion.

I would definitely return to Cafe Marlayne - probably for dinner having starved myself all day so I can do justice to the portions. If you have a huge appetite, then this is the place for you - great hearty food, big portions and great prices.
