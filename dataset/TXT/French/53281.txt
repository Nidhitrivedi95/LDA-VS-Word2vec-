QeFsIMcIFIJcOrpthYL8jg Valentine's dinner was extra special here!  The atmosphere is wonderful--beautiful building with exceptional music.  We started with cocktails and the meat and cheese platters as starters. They were both excellent--the cheeses especially stood out.  The lamb chops and duck confit were our choices for the main and they did not disappoint.  Dessert was tiramisu and creme brûlée with lovely coffees and port. The service was extraordinary and we had a wonderful conversation with Lorenzo.  He exemplifies what restaurant ownership should be.  It is very rare to see this type of hands-on customer service in this day and age.  Try this restaurant if you get a chance--you won't regret it!
