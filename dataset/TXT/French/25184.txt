Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA We went to Mix for a drink and chat on a Sunday night.  I love the view and the atmosphere, plus the fact that it is quiet and you don't have to jump through ropes to get in.  It's a nice change of pace from earlier parts of the weekend when we were clubbing around Vegas.  There's a bullet elevator going up to the top; awesome view.  Some of the stalls in the bathrooms have floor to ceiling glass windows; it's an interestingly nice view :)

I would definitely go back next time and would recommend others to visit.

The restaurant right next to the lounge has a beautiful decor - the bubbly look is so cute.  Didn't go for dinner, however, so don't know how the food is, but we saw the kitchen and the chefs~ :)
