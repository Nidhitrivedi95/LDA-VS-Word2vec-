i2dnic7VdQ3NyiQQWUXHbA Loved the ambience here (and the fact that it was a 5 minute walk from my AirBnB!) The real stars here were the beef tartar and the cocktails. The rest of the food was good but way overpriced. Frog legs were forgettable, the steak and foie gras burger were nice (but nothing special) and the chocolate mousse was pretty good but the whipped cream on top most certainly came from a can. Came expecting to be wowed and was underwhelmed.
