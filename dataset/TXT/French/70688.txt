xaqW4NkmUCGRRjmLxiFJ6Q Best crepes I've had in the GTA!

We got savoury ones during our visit and I'm so sad I didn't take a picture of it to show you how stuffed it was with ingredients. Very filling and very satisfying. Will visit again and hopefully try one of their dessert crepes and their all day breakfast crepes. Also the staff is extremely friendly!
