hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA Wow, baguette cafe is definitely a new favorite spot in vegas! Wish we had known about it much sooner. First, Olivier is such a sweet man and is so warm and welcoming. The place is small, clean, and cute. The food is GREAT! Thank you fellow yelpers. 

We had the vegetable quiche with salad, cup of carrot soup, eggplant/prosciutto sandwich, and apple carrot juice. Everything was wonderful! You can tell everything is homemade, fresh, and made with quality ingredients. We hope to see this place continue to thrive, because we will be back anytime we are in vegas!
