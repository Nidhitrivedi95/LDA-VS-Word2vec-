rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Not a great place to come on a diet.
The (no bread) tomato soup du jour was delicious if a little salty, and the (no bread) salad with (no bread) goat cheese was good as well.
Aside from the gigantic, tempting tray of amazing looking pastries - croissants, beignets filled with jam, almond things, sticky buns, etc., I almost didn't even notice all the things I couldn't have (chicken and waffles, baguette with butter, jam and nutella, croque madam, baguette some more, quiche, more bread and pastries, french toast, sparkling rose . . . . . )  Service was swell.
