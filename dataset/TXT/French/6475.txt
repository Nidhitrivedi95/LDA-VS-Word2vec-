4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Best ribeye I've ever tasted.

Came here with the boyfriend for a nice dinner while on vacation and had my socks blown off by the ribeye. It was cooked perfectly, with a nice sear on the outside. The boyfriend ordered the beef wellington and it was incredible, as well.

Wish I remembered the name of our server because he was amazing!! Sent us a dessert on the house because he thought we were cute :) Too sweet!
