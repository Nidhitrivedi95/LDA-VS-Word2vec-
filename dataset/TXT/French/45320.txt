mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q This place was really soooooo very good.  Wow!  First, you sit around the kitchen at a bar. It is awesome! It is just like a sushi bar, but not sushi!  It was so much fun to watch them cook and put the dishes together.  We had the $75 tasting menu. A splurge...but a good splurge.  The amuse was good, although I don't like foi, so I am sure foi fans would be raving about it.  The first course was this lovely veggie stack.. The anti-eggplant only meh when it comes to veggies even loved it. Second course was a langostine -- it was a fried yummy treat.  Then the entree (salmon or pork belly). Next, really tasty cheese.  And then dessert.  Oh the dessert.  We had a choice and so we got one of each between the two of us. The tarts consisted of about 10 little slivers of 10 different tarts.  So awesome!! They were soooo good.  And the sorbets were 5 scoops of 5 different sorbets!!  Also so good.  

What a gem!
