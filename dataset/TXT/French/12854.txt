4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Great solid spot in the heart of the Vegas strip, loud and fast atmosphere without losing a nice bit of charm. Dimly lit inside with candles on the tables this is a great spot to get a steak and frites or any other bistro style meal. It's not a super high line restaurant but is a solid choice for a good diner where you leave feeling like you had a great meal. Not a gimmicky laced place, it's straight forward and nicely put together, a no nonsense place.
