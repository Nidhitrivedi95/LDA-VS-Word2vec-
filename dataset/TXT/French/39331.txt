jSfnItqaOnEp2nenVF7fCg Two stars for getting seated quickly and having the order taken and brought quickly. The food was not representative of good French food. The flavor of the traditional Benedict was only salty with no other discernible flavor and the hash Benedict had no flavor. The potatoes were dripping in grease and the beignets were over cooked. I'm picky though , so feel free to try and disprove my rating....
