ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug Don't come here, service was absolutely garbage. The hostess looked like she didn't give two craps about us, and sat us down without even trying to give us menus, because there were a handful leftover on the table.

The server took too long to arrive, looked pissed, talked too low, and seemed like his mind was someplace else. He then took entirely too long to bring us a couple glasses of water, and when I went to take a sip I had the most unpleasant experience of feeling something swimming inside my mouth. I spit it back out and discovered that it was bits of lemon that were littering the water in the glass.

Both glasses were filthy full of the stuff.

I was ready to leave but it was impossible to tell someone to not bother bringing me my Heineken. When our missing server came back, I told him to cancel it because we were leaving. His response was: "you want to leave?" And then he just left. No offer to do something, no questions about why, nothing.

Avoid this place like the plague.
