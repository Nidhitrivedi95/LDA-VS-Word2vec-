q7kbg_M3RMYKNFD5CMc4FA TWIGS (stands for Two West Island Girls) is a Cafe located in Ste Anne de Bellevue in Montreal, QC.

While I love Saint Anne's for several reasons and it is home to several good restaurants, this cafe is one of my favorites.

The atmosphere is always very cozy and the menu is simply amazing.  They offer a wide range of sandwiches, soups, drinks and desserts.

Drinks include lattes, teas, coffees and smoothies.  The menu is full of healthy options and choices offered for vegetarians.

While they have their specialty sandwiches, you are also able to make your own!  This is what I always do while I am there.  My usual order is a panini with chicken, avocado, brie cheese, mustard, hummus, tomato and spinach.  While the prices may seem just a bit high for some items, it is VERY worth it.  For my sandwich, the amount of brie cheese they use alone would cost the amount of the sandwich.  It is delicious and I am craving one as I type.

There are quite a few restaurants in Ste Anne's I would recommend however this one is perfect for a snowy day inside or a refreshing summer day.  I would go to TWIGS every day if I could.
