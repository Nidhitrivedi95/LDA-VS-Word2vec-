aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw Bouchon Bakery is one of the those considerate venues in Vegas that allow for "small victories". For little more than the average person would spend at Starbucks, you get to sample something that feels like head-mutha French chef of 20 Michelin stars spent quite some time devising.

The carrot cake-cookie that everyone raves about has a nice, subtle flavor and quite an appealing texture. Even better was the fruit tart here. Damn, that thing had a delicious crust! Hate how tarts are often soggy or stale from sitting out for too long in bakeries? For something like three, four dollars, Bouchon selflessly saves tart-lovers of the world from tired pasts of display-shelf deception and consequent grief. 

This humanitarian aid station can be found near the Venetian elevators to the guest rooms.
