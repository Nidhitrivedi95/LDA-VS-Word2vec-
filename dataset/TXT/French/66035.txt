udFcIcbWbxrO8uLF95WnQg Decent, but overrated for the price. 

The main seafood courses were good (I had cod, others had salmon). 

The bread was not warm. The salads were lacking and overpriced. Our waiter was uninterested (despite mentioning we were celebrating our Dad's birthday, he did not check in on our food, do anything special, and misunderstood his beer recommendation as a preference instead of giving a tasting as he promised). The crispy giant pork stack was too rich and fatty.

One time visit was enough. Nothing special unfortunately although we were looking forward to a special night.
