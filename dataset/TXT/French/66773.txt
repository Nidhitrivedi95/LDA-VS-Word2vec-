UpEVdq_euH-5mqCIgUAd2Q Came for winterlicious and found it to be of great value. They're in the $25 dinner range but the quality and service is above average. The portions are also pretty big - I left the restaurant stuffed. 

I would recommend going for the soup of the day because the other 2 appetizer choices are less than impressive. They served a sweet potato and apple soup on the day I went - I wish the soup was served a little warmer but it was still acceptable. Unfortunately I didn't taste much sweet potato, and the "apple" portion was definitely apple sauce. The soup was good, but for sure there's room for improvement. You can also upgrade to the French onion soup for $4. 

The lamb shank and duck confit were great mains! I was surprised at how tender and soft the meats were. Only drawback is that I wish there was more sauce to accompany the meat and mashed potatoes.
