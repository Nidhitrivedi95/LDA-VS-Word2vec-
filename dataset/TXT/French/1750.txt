0JGMKaKJGVuDus5WcJzvjw My family and I reserved months in advance to prepare for our trip to Montreal. Though we were initially shocked by the high prices, we were absolutely blown away by the food. We started off with foie gras, and were pleasantly surprised by how nice and smooth it was. Not the usual fatty foie gras you would expect. We had a basic salad as well. For our entree, we split up the Lobster Spaghetti ($50+) and Chicken ($45). The pasta was definitely worth the price, but we were surprised by the price of the chicken. After seeing that we may need a little more food, we added the brussel sprouts. Boy was that a good idea! Those were the highlight of the night!  We finished with two desserts, and our total bill was over $200. If you don't mind paying the big bucks, I HIGHLY recommend it!
