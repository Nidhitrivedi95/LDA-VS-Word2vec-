s-zwyD8YOm-y3AbRrsRx7w I wish i could eat at this place every day of the year but due to our hot summers Ive decided its a fall and winter spot. I love this place beyond words, the owner and his wife are great and all the staff as well. I know that they have been open for 100 years ( clearly not 100) but they still have the same recipe they did since i started going. 

Richard used to be my favorite waiter but since hes no longer with them i guess that my fav cosmos are being made by someone else :( 

I love the cheese fondue and most people will say its basic its nothing fancy but its great! Ive been to other fondue spots in Paris where cheese is their life and they nail it clealrly but so do these guys. I always crack pepper on top of the cheese to give it that extra flavour.

I think the best part about coming here is the fact that they always give me the spot in front of the fireplace and that they have a guy playing the piano on the weekends, hes been there for ages and hes always got a big smile on his face.
