I ordered the French onion soup and it has a good amount of cheese in it! For entrée, I had the Basque Croq, which is a sandwich with roasted tomatoes, spinach and Swiss cheese. I added ham and potatoes to it, and that was really delicious! The best was the dessert: lavender crème burlee. So good. Both the custard and caramelized layer were perfect.

Highly recommended for those looking for good a meal with cozy environment.
