aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw i was a macaroon virgin until i went to vegas and im SO glad that i got to try my first macaroon at Bouchon! albeit a bit pricey ($3.50) for a piece, id say that its good for a nice dessert or nibble while youre walking through the casinos. the exterior is a little crunchy and the inside is soo soft and chewy!! mmm! 

pistachio for the win!
