vna49NPM-7B11tcFPTgnsg One of the best meals I have had in Montreal.  We came early and sat at the counter to watch the head chef and I gotta say that guy's got his mojo on.  The food was precise, complex and delicious - and though it was a little decadent I felt perfectly satisfied after the meal. 
The weakness were the desserts, though made up for by their creativity.
