The service is on point every time. The employees are so genuine and they care about their job and it shows. That's really what makes Baguette Cafe such a success for me.
I usually go for their chipotle panini which was recommended to me by the gentleman working and it's dynamite, but everything I have had is delicious! I love the simple side salad, it's always fresh. 
The location is a little hard to find the first few times, but the owner has put up signs that lead you in the right direction.
