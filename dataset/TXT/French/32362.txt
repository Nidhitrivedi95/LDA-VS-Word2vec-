Again every bite was savoury; the vegetable root soup that was on the house, blood sausage with fois gras, she had a fish dish and I had a bison ribs dish along with dessert.  Just the thought of it is making my mouth water!  

Hats of to the chef!  Next time I'll be sure to bring a bottle of wine as they are a BYOB establishment; the first time I've seen such a place!
