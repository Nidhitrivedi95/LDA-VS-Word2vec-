I have to point out that there were some funny moments at the beginning of the meal, but some people may not find them very funny.  This was back in November 2009 and they had just that day painted the edges of the front door.  The paint was fresh and the insulating layer for the front entrance kept coming unglued and smacking people with wet white paint.  I saw a few ruined jackets that night, but it was almost comical as the waiters would run to the door as quickly as a patron had arrived, attempting to stop them from getting a splash.  In any case, I was sitting near the door and had an incident where I spilled water on my girlfriend - all because I was trying to protect a couple from getting a nice white stripe on their coats.

On to the food.  They had a very custom handwritten menu with specials.  It was very involved.  I stuck with some basics though.  Started with a seasonal butternut squash soup.  What I really wanted was the french onion, but they were out that night.  I'm not disappointed though because the butternut squash was more than a suitable replacement, it made me forget that it was a replacement at all!  Next was the Duck Confit (Confit de Canard) - mouth watering overpowering flavor - seasoned perfectly.  Made me forget about how cold and rainy it was outside.  I felt like I was in a comfortable Parisian cafe in the summer.

Service was excellent, friendly, conversational, yet prompt.  I guess if I was on the receiving end of the paint though, I might have dropped them a star, so consider yourself lucky, La Palette!  Haha.

One of the top-10 meals of my life.  Period.
