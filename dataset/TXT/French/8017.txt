4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Delicious from the first bite to the last! This is one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas because of the good food, service, and overall experience. My friend and I went in for dinner with no reservations and were seated immediately. Our waitress came by shortly after and was very knowledgable.

They served us a warm baguette (1 star goes just to having warm bread) with butter. We were also served a delicious carrot salad. My order of salmon with vegetables was perfect and was of a generous proportion. My friend also enjoyed her salad with salmon.

If we weren't so full and exhausted we'd definitely try their drinks or dessert...but now  it'll give us another reason to visit next time we're in town!
