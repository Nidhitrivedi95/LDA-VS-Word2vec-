37kk0IW6jL7ZlxZF6k2QBg Third time a charm? Unfortunately, it was abit of a disappointment. We had the 7-course dinner, and there were some definitely good dishes and misses. The main chicken & lobster was our least favorite. The dessert crepe was unappetising, the cake too wet with rum. While our overall experience, service, atmosphere was good, it wasn't exceptional like our first time here. Rated down to 3.5

Review based on dinner and Sunday Lunch with 1/2 price wine. Great wine recommendation.
The food was excellent, deceivingly simple but prepared well.  Space is intimate and cozy, service is the same. Its a special place, I almost don't want to recommend this place since its been so difficult to get a reservation here.
