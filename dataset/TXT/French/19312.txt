aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw Funny how I never made it to the one at Time Warner Center in New York even though I live there. Anyway I got a carrot cake sandwich, a TKO, and three macarons (vanilla, chocolate, coffee.) Macarons were good, but I actually thought they were too big, too flat, and a bit too crispy. They definitely weren't the best macarons I've ever had. I liked the cookies better. I recommend both. Overall everything was delicious, but considering the price I expected them to blow me away and they didn't. Doesn't mean I won't come back, but I'm not exactly having dreams about them as I usually do with newly discovered sweets!
