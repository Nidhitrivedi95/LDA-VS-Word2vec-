COgwFthJpS4We16W5Gf4lw I don't know why this restaurant has as high a rating as it does. First off the location on the wrong side of town, next to a tattoo parlor, makes you feel like you are going to get mugged getting from your car to the front door.  Upon entering, the stench from some sort of incense or candle is overwhelming. If you can get past that then you have to endure the run down decor and the slightly sticky menus. Needless to say, couldn't take the ambiance long enough to place a dinner order. Our waiter seemed genuinely upset about our leaving even though we left a 75% tip for the bottle of Pelegrino we ordered but didn't consume.  The experience we had was so awful it almost seemed like we were in the starting sequence of a B rated halloween movie. We didn't want to wait around to participate in the slasher scene.
