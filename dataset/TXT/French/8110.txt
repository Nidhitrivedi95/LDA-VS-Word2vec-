4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Cute french restaurant that my friends highly recommended in Vegas! 
Definitely worth going even for their house wine and baguettes!

As soon as we walked in, there were 3 hostesses, all on their phones and pretty rude. One of the hostess asked us inside or out, so we said "out". As we were walking towards whatever table she was going to sit us at, we noticed a room that was between being inside and out so... we asked her if we can actually sit in this area.  She gave us an attitude saying that the area is obviously considered "inside".  Well... ok?  We obviously knew that, but changed our minds. 

Brunch specials are only on weekends so unfortunately we missed out on that because we went on tuesday. So instead, we ordered their mussels, french onion soup, unlimited baguette and their Mon Ami Gabi white wine and red wine.  Everything satisfied our tummy! 

What I liked the most about this place was our server.  After that hostess ruined our view of this restaurant, it was good to have an amazing server.  She was so sweet and attentive. Thank you, Susanna for brightening our day with your kindness and service!
