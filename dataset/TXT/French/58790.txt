rSiSZlTzHi4Ox_rFHe9CdA I work in the area and I'm always looking for a solid tex-mex and this place has it.  

I tried the chicken burrito; the chicken was tasty and the ingredients were fresh.  The burrito itself was a substantial size and a great value when compared to the other similar restaurants.  The one thing that separates this restaurant from others was the fresh ingredients.

I would definitely visit this restaurant again.
