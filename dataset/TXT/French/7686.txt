4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Pros: Cool vibe, excellent service, quality drinks and close to Bellagio.

Cons: Food quality was a little suspect.

Be prepared to drop at least $50 per person (with one drink) at this place but don't expect the highest quality steaks.  The drinks are great as is the service and if it's not too hot, sit on the patio with a view of the Bellagio's fountain.
