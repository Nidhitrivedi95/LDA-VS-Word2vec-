_O12nlv3sISPfiNAQVLM4Q The reason why I'm not giving this place 3 stars + is because of the prices. Let's be clear m! I'm not cheap when I go out to eat but if I'm ordering basic food that comes with no sides I shouldn't be Paying that much money. Prices don't match up to the place. 

Moving along. I ordered the steak with home fries but instead got French fries.. whatever.. I was starving and ended up eating it anyway. The steak was really good and the fries average as any fries would be. I ordered my daughter chicken wings with fries (an order of 6 small wings was $16 & the fries came separate at an extra cost!! My cousin got French onion soup which she said tasted sour. The waiter was nice so thumbs up to him. 

Besides that I wouldn't go back here when I do make a trip out to Montreal again.
