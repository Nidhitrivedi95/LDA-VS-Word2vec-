4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw My boyfriend and I came here on a Friday night with an 8pm dinner reservation, and were seated within 5 minutes. (Reservation highly recommended as this place will get busy!)

The hostesses, bus staff, and our waitress were all friendly and attentive to us even though the place was pretty packed.

We ordered the escargot, scallops gratinee, salmon, and French green beans. All the dishes were fresh and tasty and came out fairly quickly. 

The pricing is great especially for Vegas, and the atmosphere is nice although it is a really dark/romantic type of atmosphere if you go at night. 

Would definitely go back to try more of the menu!
