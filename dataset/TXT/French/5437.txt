We ordered the steak tartare for appetizer and that was great. I ordered the duck confit and my bf ordered the hangar steak. Probably because we usually get much bigger portions in NY that we were surprised the portions were on the smaller side. The entrees weren't pricey so we were like okay, you get what you pay for. Both entrees were delicious. 

What took off two stars and made our experience unpleasant was:
1. There was hair on our bread 
2. The waitress only charged us for 3 glasses of wine rather than 4 and we thought she comped us because there was hair on the bread. My BF thanked her and she said "NO i have to take the bill back and recharge you again." This was after we got the bill and we were ready to swipe. It was only $8 per glass so nbd but the fact that she took it back after we were ready to pay made it seem very rude. We would've tipped her extra in the same amount anyways.
