rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A The food was so good I had to take pictures of all the dishes we ordered!

Be sure to wear something nice before coming here. I looked like a fool wearing shorts, a shirt, and sandals.

All the dishes were unique. I remember trying their escargot as well as some of the other well-known dishes like their white sausage. (Be sure to look at the pics I took!) 

Once you finish eating at the Bistro, stop by their bakery which is locate on the lower level of the Venetian. Their macaroons are the best and they have a greater variety than the macaroons in Manhattan.
