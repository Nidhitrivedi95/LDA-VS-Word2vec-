They've done a slight renovation, brightening the space with a coat of white paint, new lighting, and some tasteful splashes of colour.  The menu is tapas style-- we had mussels in a white wine broth, octopus in a tomato sauce, and fried artichokes with a puttanesca dipping sauce, followed by a small cheese plate.  The plates are larger than what you are usually served in Toronto tapas places, but the quality does not suffer: it was all excellent, as was the sourdough bread.  They have an impressive array of olives on the menu which you can mix and match. This is a great place for drinks and an elegant, informal dinner.  They have a nice selection of wine and beer, and some great looking cocktails (we stuck with beer and wine on this visit).  Staff at Nuit are very friendly and knowledgeable, and able to make helpful recommendations, without pushing you to order more as is sometimes the case in tapas places.  Owner Tino introduced himself and made some great wine suggestions; very likeable guy and I hope his little bar/restaurant is the success it deserve to be.
