1j9BbuiaVYQWyXyUjb3rHg Came here recently for the second time and the verdict is in...Maison Fou is an average-at-best restaurant with nice decor and good service.

The big wrench in the mix here is that this is one the only pretenders in the "grown up" restaurant category in the neighbourhood. As Bloor West is full of families with 2-3 kids under 12 and retirees who have lived here for generations, the day-to-day demand for a classier restaurant, brew pub or cocktail bar is either not here or extremely pent-up due to other factors such as exorbitantly high rents. Some of the reviews may skew higher because there are neighbours who desperately want some place to go that is not a kid-zone or chain pub.

For my appetizer I had a gazpach-fou soup, which was a few shrimp, avocado pieces, and cucumber pieces floating in some sugary water. I cannot imagine how anyone creating the menu tasted that and thought it was something anyone would order twice.

For my main I opted for the burger (I had a reasonably good gnocchi on a previous visit.) The burger was a good size (and also cooked to temperature) and the fries were ok. The problem was that it was too salty. I had to fight the urge to go to Yogurty's Froyo afterward because of the extremely salty taste in my mouth.

In conclusion it will be difficult to return. While it is nice to have an adult-only space for dinner, there are better options on the west side of town for the money.
