33Tr0eRki1Yamzleu4GMdw I really wanted to like this place better but I only found the pastries to be okay.  Okay by Vegas standards would be quite good in Hawaii (fewer bakeries than before) but there are so many other bakeries in the Vegas area that I salivate when I think about, it doesn't seem worth getting only-ok pastries.  Maybe I haven't tried the "right" ones on the two visits I made.
