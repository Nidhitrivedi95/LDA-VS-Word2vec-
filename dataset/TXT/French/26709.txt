Da6eZFThE9xanUAGNpZxAg After a long, but wonderful work day in the lovely city of Toronto, I found myself starving while every kitchen seemed to be closed. Lucky for us Nuit, hence its name, stays open after 10PM and serves up some seriously delicious eats unlike no other. 

It's discreet, dimly lit, quaint, and sexy. We each ordered a glass of red and I indulged in a huge, ridiculously tender, fall-off-the-bone lamb shank served over a savory version of mushroom couscous. Tino, the man who was serving us was exceptionally pleasant and hospitable. During the close of our meal, we engaged in conversation only to find out that he was the owner of this wonderful establishment. From his kindness to the quality of the food, the menu selection and the beautiful space, it was apparent that he took pride in his business and appreciated his patrons. 

Can't say enough wonderful things about our delicious experience here. Looking forward to visiting Toronto again, and when I do, Nuit will certainly be on my to-go list.
