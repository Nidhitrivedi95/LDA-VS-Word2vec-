SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ There are many tricks here,  a great garden patio and a fancy mystique. Some how this tricks people to over look the mediocre food and poor service.

I made a online reservation for Sat night, however upon arrival I found that was not necessary as they were not full. 

We started with the Ahi watermelon salad $13. It has 3 small slices of sashimi and 8 blocks of watermelon with some greens and a wasabi glaze. It was good but very very small.

For our mains we had a Potato chip wrapped wild sea bass on a plat of beans and sauce $30. The Fish was bit over cooked and too firm, the beans and sauce lacked much flavor. We also had the Goat Cheese veggie  Lasagna $20, While it did look nice topped with Julianned squash and a nice swoosh of pesto on the plate, it was nothing special. 

The bread comes with a sweet butter which is nice. 

We had some wine by the glass that was decently priced for the environment.

Overall it was an impressive place for a date however the food did not impress.
