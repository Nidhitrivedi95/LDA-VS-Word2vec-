gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA On our first visit to Vegas, we wanted to have a pre-anniversary wedding anniversary and after looking different restaurants we could have had our dinner, this restaurant came up on a small thread of comments on a Facebook page of Vegas and made reservations well in advance (2 months) and they did give us a table looking at the window and had a nice view of the strip.

The restaurant it located at top of the Palms Casino and Hotel, which is off the strip. For your convenience there is complimentary valet parking but it is nice to give them tip for saving you the inconvenience on going to find a parking spot on their multilevel garage.

Once you enter the Palms, you enter directly to the Casino (as expected) and we had to walk to staff to lead us to the restaurant desk. The hostess confirmed the reservation and led us to the elevator that took us to the top of the building where the restaurant is, so pretty much you cannot get to that elevator unless you have reservation to have dinner there.

After the elevator finally reached the top, we were immediately welcomed by the staff and took us to our table, which was ready for the occasion. We had the 7 course tasting menu and a couple cocktails. Even when every plate is a smaller portion, at the end of the tasting you are full.

Every single plate was so beautiful that it was heartbreaking having to eat it, they were just amazing and delicate.

Our waiter was just amazing, attentive, making sure we were having a wonderful night. 

The restaurant it is quite small (not tinny) but that makes the environment more intimate and you are able to have a nice conversation without the loud music than other restaurants (specially on the strip)

Highly recommended but yes, it is definitely pricey but absolutely worth it as the views, service, food and the experience itself is outstanding.

Looking forward to return to this restaurant on my next trip to Vegas.
