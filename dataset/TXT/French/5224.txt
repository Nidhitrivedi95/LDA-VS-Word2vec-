3FlWR_osNPb8dcqLgHebHw Horrible. Got eggs benedict. Hollandaise was separated and had the consistency of curdled yogurt. Huge eggshell in the "poached" egg. It was a solid boiled egg. Will not return. Cynthia, water, was very sweet and efficient.  She saw that half my plate was unfinished and didn't care to ask why.
