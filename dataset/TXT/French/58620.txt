RfsMUrGUJdrpfrU54rmEsQ Escargot is a must! The cheese board is a got to have, the wine is always on point. I have personally enjoyed the duck, salmon, a few different steaks, many different specials... always enjoyed every bite and always want to come back. Perfect for date night and also my go to spot for happy hour! Everyone there is fantastic and I feel so lucky to be able to enjoy coming here regularly!
