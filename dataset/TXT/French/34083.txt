hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA I Would give 4.5 stars if possible . This very French lunch sandwich bistro/ cafe is s very good . The French owners (I assume) who work there are friendly and efficient . I went during a busy lunch rush around 12:30 mid week and the tables were almost full . I had to wait ~20 minutes for my lunch from order at the register to walking out the door with my paper bag . 

The lunch itself was good . I had the Moroccan which was had chicken , goat cheese and some red peppers . The soup was broccoli cheese but was blended fully until green and a fully liquid texture . I will definitely be back and appreciate the great service and explanations .
