CrIQLWcvOYWDFAl-UWgkxw Nice atmosphere. I didn't love our waitress, rushing us to order. No cocktail list. Main courses did not come out all together so we sat and waited. I had lamb shank and it was alright, not as soft and braised as i had expected, and I didn't care the it's sides of mash potatoes and yam and lentils of some sort all soft and mushy no contrast in texture, I would have wanted green beans. The grilled octopus was small portioned and a little mushy. Not sure if I would visit here again. Difficult street parking and location in middle of nowhere on Yonge.
