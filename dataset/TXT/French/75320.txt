y6rN3pUCfOkq41_m3Bk2nw After Bachata at Babaluu in nearby Yorkville, we met up with Chef Benett at Brownes Bistro after close for a specially prepared meal that blew our taste buds away.  His specially prepared liver (that was easily the best liver I've ever had), ice blanched vegetables that had so much flavor I couldn't remember the last time I enjoyed eating broccoli this much, not to mention his melt-in-your-mouth mashed potatoes.  I don't know he does it, but he consistently out does himself every time.  The meal was paired beautifully with his house favorite Kenwood Merlot.  Do yourself a favour and check this place out; and tell Benett about this review, you will get a little extra something something. :)
