tCp1OkefhamXLeTnmEPUow Love the location (Bernard) especially the Terrasse, however, I always felt there is something missing. 

I mean, I go there to be with friends and enjoy the outdoor but not for the food. 

I had the Foie Gras (entree) and Ribs (main)...and a few pops to enjoy a boys night out. 

Foie Gras, very tiny portion, well cooked, a bit of "acidity" in the after taste...hard to explain...was just not on point.

The ribs...one can find better ribs at Madison, Baton Rouge alikes...

We had a blast with the staff tho...very fun night...real first Terrasse night out of the season with the boys. We will probably return for brunch or Sunday afternoon drinks, but...been there, done that ...and the long and the short is ...Les Enfants is not my first choice, but a semi good second or third choice for your outings.
