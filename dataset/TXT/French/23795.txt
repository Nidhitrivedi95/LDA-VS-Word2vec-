cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg Exquisite foie gras. The rest of the food was good. Feels a bit over rated. My main issue is that they served us creme brulee that was VERY brulee... so much that it tasted burned. They said that this is how they made it. Makes no sense. I think they burned them and decided to serve them nevertheless. There are many other restaurants in MTL that don't serve burned food...
