(Visit my page to read my other top 5 reviews!)

So many great nights spent here! This place is basically the Guu Izakaya of Montreal with a twist! Don't get your expectations up as the food is quite average. I would highly recommended the black cod. Trust me, this dish is a solid 5. 

This is a place where you pay for the atmosphere rather than food. Imadake never disappoints! I love how they have a blackboard to scribble on especially when you are drunk. Great place to take pics and laugh about the next day. 

Trust me you know it will be an unforgettable night when the "sake bombs" and "rainbow bombs" arrive. Highly recommended to go for the experience!
