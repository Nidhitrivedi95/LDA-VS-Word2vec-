The decor and menu is what you would expect from a French restaurant and there is an extensive wine list. The duck entree I ordered, which came with a mushroom risotto was ok only. The skin of the duck was very good but the duck meat itself was a bit bland, as was the risotto. The others also didn't seem to love their dishes, which made me wish we had dined elsewhere since we were only visiting Montreal for 3 nights. The fries that came with the mussels were good - the typical type of fries served at French establishments and it also came with a large amount of mussels that we couldn't finish.
