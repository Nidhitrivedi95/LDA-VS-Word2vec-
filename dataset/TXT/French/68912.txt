VwZhwflLnTq19aAeFLJHCQ This place made me feel like I was sailing on an antique ship. I feel like that's the vibe they were going for. Good food, decent wine selection, friendly staff. I got that chicken schnitzel dish and opted to have it with mashed potatoes instead of pasta the second time. Oh, cause I've been there twice now because it's close to me and I'm a hungry gal. I had it with pasta the first time and thought wtf, this should be paired with creamy heavenly mashed potatoes ya know? All the desert is delicious. I had the tiramisu with ice cream and I'd prob get it again. I think our party got a lil drunk and loud cause we're classy like that. Good time had by all.
