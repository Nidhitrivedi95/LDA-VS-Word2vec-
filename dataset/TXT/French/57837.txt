rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Oh Bouchon, I've heard so many great things about you and you certainly didn't disappoint. While I didn't think the service was particularly stellar (or bad) the food was certainly top notch.

We started off with a {CHEESE PLATE} all of these cheeses were delicious and included some fresh honey, that was really delightful. We ordered  {SALADE DE POMMES POCHEES} to share, which was pretty sweet, and more dessert like but we all still really enjoyed it but probably could be saved for a dessert course instead of a salad plate. For dinner I ordered the {STEAK DIANE} which was absolutely mouthwatering good, cooked to perfection is some "diane" sauce, I really want some more just thinking about it.

To round off dinner we ended with a {CREME BRUELE} and the {MAISON AU CHOCOLATE} with the perfect sweetness to end off the night.
