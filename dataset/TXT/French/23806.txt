cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg I'm so conflicted about PDC. 
Was it good?  Yes. 
Was it mind-blowingly amazing; a lavishly decadent meal guaranteed to make your own liver into foie gras from overconsumption of luscious aforementioned product (from a duck and hopefully not a human)? 
Ehhh. 

Maybe it's because I had super hyped it up on my own head.  Having learned of PDC ~10 years ago, it took awhile before I had the chance to visit Montreal again.  It also takes awhile to get reservations: I once found out that 1 month in advance wasn't nearly enough notice for reservations.  This time, I called 4 months ahead to nab the spot. 

The best thing about PDC for me was the service. Super friendly and helpful with recommendations.  I was planning to go on a foie gras bender, but the waitstaff gently recommended that I not make myself sick and hate foie forever.  With his advice, here's what ordered for the night:

- Foie gras cromesquis: tiny squares of breaded & fried foie gras, popped in one bite so the molten liquid foie spreads across your tongue in all its delicious glory.  Think sugar cube, made of foie. 
- Naked foie gras: Two generous slabs of foie that's been seared and covered with what I recall as balsamic reduction.  It was good, but I just thought there would be less "stuff" on it, y'know? 
- Savoury clams on the half shell: Raw pasta clams - I didn't even know you can eat these raw!  Less toothsome than the usual cherrystone variety and of course, much smaller given the nature of the savoury clam. The hubs found them fishy. 
- Duck carpaccio: A thin sheet of raw duck covers the plate and is then dotted with accoutrement like egg yolk.  Am sorry to say that I can't recollect much else of the dish at the moment, but I remember having liked it while the hubs found it "weird and gamey". 
- Duck in a can: Basically duck cooked sous-vide.  Impressive showmanship when the can is opened at the table and poured into the dish on front if you.  The duck itself is okay, but I wish the skin were crispy...also, this may sound ridiculous and bum-holey, but I thought it tasted very single-noted (like plain old duck).  There was a slab of foie gras encased in the can too, but somehow the duck itself lacked depth of flavour to me...yes, yes, warned you I'm going to sound like a bum hole!
- Braised beef: Promptly and voraciously devoured by the hubs, who echoed through the next week or so that it was the best plate of the night.  This was off the daily specials menu. 
- Maple pudding Chomeur: Super sweet bread-type pudding
- Crepes Suzette: Very liquored up, but set alight at the table to burn off the alcohol so only the taste remains

As far as restaurants go, I really did enjoy this place.  The conflict for me is likely more internal - I thought that PDC would have the best foie gras in the world.  And while it was certainly readily available, it just wasn't the *~OMG BEST!~*  I'd say keep your expectations in check then go to PDC and enjoy.
