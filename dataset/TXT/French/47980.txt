O3OH5IEFMPtz7mPKakPZ3Q My boyfriend and I decided to try something new by our house. Thank goodness we did!! Such a nice ambiance. Nice staff. The food is beautiful, not expensive and absolutely full of flavor!!! We will absolutely be back! 
P.s.
The Rock Shrimp was hands down the best shrimp I've ever had. From texture to taste. The best.
