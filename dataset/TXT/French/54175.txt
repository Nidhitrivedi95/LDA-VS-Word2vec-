rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw We had brunch here last Sunday. The ambiance is lovely and the servers are very nice. Unfortunately, the food was disappointing in a few instances. I ordered an Irish coffee which arrived cold. They took it back and heated it and it took way too long, and arrived barely luke warm. Hubby ordered the Huntsman Waffle with the duck confit and poached eggs, asked for the eggs poached hard, they came extremely soft so he sent them back. The rest of our group went ahead and ate, and it took a long time for my husband's meal to come out. No apology, no concession on the bill. Service was pretty slow also. However, the Nutella sticky bun is awesome, as was the smoked salmon starter.
