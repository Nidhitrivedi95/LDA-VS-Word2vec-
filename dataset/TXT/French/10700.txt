4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw What a find! I would venture that it's the only place on the strip where you can have such a great view and good food at such a reasonable price. The bread was delicious, the drinks were great, and the steak was gigantic, it could have really been split between two people. We sat on the inner patio and still had a great view of the Bellagio show. Service was good. And our waiter even spoke with a French accent (although I'm 98% sure it was fake to increase the ambiance).
