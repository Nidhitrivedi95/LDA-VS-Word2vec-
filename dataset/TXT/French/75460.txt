Ycp3Agr7dt71TZkeKV7jng Watch out - they will overcharge you!!   Their wall menu board say $2.00 for an Americana but they charge $2.80.  I confronted them and they said it was the new price for over a month.  They did not care that it was illegal to post one price and charge a higher one - told me to email the manager.  They also refused to charge me the posted price and the cashier just walked away saying it was not her problem.  Nice.
