rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A We came here for dinner on 9/20/2013 and perhaps, the kitchen staff was having an "off night" but I was definitely underwhelmed by Bouchon. 

We ordered the bone marrow (moëlle rôttie), pan roasted Idaho trout (trouite poelée), and the leg of lamb (gigot d'agneau). The bone marrow barely had the gelatinous fat while the lamb was less than mediocre. The trout, however, was decent. 

3 stars for the excellent wine and the atmosphere (we were seated outside by the fountain).
