Zl6csaZ5HBka3SKBphHXrQ I came here for Summerlicious and I found the food to be really good! I especially enjoyed my dessert - profiteroles with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce! There were a few things that I wasn't too thrilled about though - I found the restaurant to be very tiny and cramped. Conversations were somewhat awkward since I was sitting directly next to another customer. I also didn't find the risotto very filling which was a bit of a shame since I found it to be quite tasty! My overall take on Midi - good food with great prices!
