SBnpT6JDbah-5l_52GM5sw Food was on the heavy side but was nonetheless delicious...The reason why I marked off stars was bc of the service.  I called ahead twice to request a slice of cake to be brought out for my dad's 70th bday as a surprise.  When we arrived I secretly reminded the hostess about the surprise cake and also requested them to bring the check to me...basically so my dad wouldn't try to pay for the meal.  The exact opposite ended up happening!! As soon as we were done with our main course, they took our plates, brought the check,  and handed it DIRECTLY to my dad.  I was so annoyed.  Not only did they forget the cake, but they didn't even offer dessert.  I couldn't wrestle the check out of my dad's hands so he ended up paying.  Total birthday fail. Why would the staff do this?  I was so sad I couldn't treat my dad for his bday.
