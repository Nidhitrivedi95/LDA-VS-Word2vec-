or4UVDjXEEjze3wNPjoAZA I spotted Zinc Bistro while shopping at Kierland Commons and it reminded me of Balthazar in NYC, which I love, so I just had to come back back for dinner. From the beginning I really wanted to like Zinc Bistro however the service was pretty bad and the food was subpar at best. 

We came for a late dinner on a Friday night without reservations and were immediately seated at a lovely little table on the patio. The mood was festive and lively...so far so good. 

Unfortunately it all went downhill from there. Our server wasn't the least bit friendly, attentive or accommodating. The only times I actually saw her was when she took our food and drink order and dropped the check. She never checked if we wanted another round or how our food was. The food took forever after we placed our order, like 45 minutes, and once it was finally brought out it was not only wrong but cold as well. I was tempted to just leave and go a few doors down to The Greene House where I had a much more enjoyable lunch. 

Overall I wouldn't recommend Zinc Bistro for anything more than drinks and maybe a light snack. It has potential to be a charming brasserie but they really need to work on service and quality control.
