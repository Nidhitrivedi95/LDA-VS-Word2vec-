Yelp lists this as a "Gastropub"; based off of that definition and the consistent 4-star rating I was expecting much more.  The Tuesday night special $0.25 pierogis were definitely the highlight.  The other food I ordered ranged from not good to not great.  The arancini were extremely greasy.  The curry crab bisque was strange (and not a bisque by my standards,) and the salad was basically lettuce with some craisins thrown on top (no almonds as advertised.)  If I were to return, I'd get a plate of pierogis and call it a day.  However, it's unlikely that I would.  As I mentioned earlier, they have some really interesting infused vodkas so my recommendation would be to eat elsewhere and stick with the booze.
