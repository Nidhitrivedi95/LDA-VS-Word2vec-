4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Want to give a shout out to My T. on this one, because him and his wife Thao T. brought me here for the first time.  But Alcatraz is for locals too, so don't hate plaYa!!

One of my favorite brunch spots on the strip.  Actually I've been in Vegas for a little less than a month now, so I don't have too many brunch spots on the strip, but I still love this place.

Nice tip:  Also learned this from My T, when you're waiting for your table, there is a bar in the back in the outside area where you can hang out and people watch and enjoy a drink.  This is actually a crucial part of the experience here for me.  

Tip #2, you want a table outside.  Inside is a bit boring and I always see the younger crowds outside.

Good food (a bit pricey, but that's how the strip rolls) good people watching and other views like the fountains, this place is cool.  I still would give it 5 stars even though I feel the food is a bit pricey.

Recommendations on food are the salmon salad if you are gonna be a weenie and not want something greasy like me sometimes, or I would go steak frites if you wanna go big.  The fries are crispy which is too annoying.

I have yet to try the onion soup, everyone seems to be raving about it!
