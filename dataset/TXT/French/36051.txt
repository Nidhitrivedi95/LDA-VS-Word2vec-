HyKtNKSuxy9iCX2I7havKQ The ambiance is wonderful, inside and outside seating. 
Menu is a bit small and they were out of the mushroom bisque when I was there for lunch.
The salmon and the house salad were fresh and prepared just right. It seemed a bit pricey, but location and decor are really good. Lovely quiet French music, lake views, lovely.
I looked at the happy hour menu and I'll be back for that!
