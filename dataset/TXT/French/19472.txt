aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw Ughhh!! Why do all the good things have to be bad for me!?!? This place is so bad for my diet but...sometimes when you're in vegas...you gotta sin a little....(yes, i live here but noone has to know!) 

Came here with friends after eating at the Grand Lux. I had the Chocolate Mousse Cupcake...and oh man...it was rich and the mousse was totally yummy! The fruit tart was good...but I tasted one of the melon wedges and it tasted like a wet rag! It was such a turn off...but Rachel D loved it!! She has a thing for wet rags! =)

Anyway, would totally come back here. Aside from their awesome patries, they have quality napkins and plastic utensils! When you live in Vegas, you gotta advantage of all the free things available. That's including "shopping" for napkins and silverwares at casino hotels.You see...that's what I get for being Filipino!  =)
