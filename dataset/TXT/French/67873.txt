V0iYi5OjdRcz82m95jV7vQ Amazing spot with TO DIE FOR pastries. I just finished trying the chocolate almond croissant and the quiche lorraine and was so excited about this place that I had to write a review immediately after consumption. The atmosphere is wonderful, the staff is very helpful and friendly, and the assortment of treats (savory and sweet, best of both worlds) is superb. Their hazelnut latte was wonderful as well. Bravo, Renaissance Patisserie! 

Ps. Pro tips: their quiche slices are HUGE and only $5. Great meal to share unless you're feeling ambitious. The chocolate almond croissant was also $5 and worth every penny. The latte comes out super hot, I didn't see any coffee sleeves for the to go cups so you may need to ask or double up on some napkins.
