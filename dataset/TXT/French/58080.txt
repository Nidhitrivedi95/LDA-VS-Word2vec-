rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A It was probably a little early in the season to eat outdoors, but we braved it anyway.  It was very peaceful in the garden at the Venetian.  

We skipped starters and went straight to mains.  I had the salmon with peas and wild mushrooms, hubby had a croque madam with fries and sister had mussels with fries.  I have NEVER seen so many fries on one table - must remember never to order extra fries here! 

That said, everything was cooked beautifully and I enjoyed every morsel of my dinner.  

No complaints - it's a lovely place to eat in Vegas (and especially if you're staying in the Venetian, then it's very convenient!)
