_eNeiqWPt1MPLFF6DEIJeA Came on a Saturday night around 8:15, restaurant was half full.  Decor and layout are nice.  Menu was alright, some interesting options.  We ordered drinks, a duck wing appetizer, and entrees.  The duck came out and was presented well, sauce was good, but way too much and being sweet, it overpowered the duck which was unfortunate.  Entrees finally came around 9:30.... For fried rice and a soup entree.. A hour later.. The fried rice tasted like a bagged Asian dish from Sam's club, and the soup tasted like a Philly cheese steak over not fully cooked broth and a watery broth with no flavor.   Server never checked back to see how food was or to update during the 30+ minutes that passed from when we finished our appetizer to when our entrees arrived.  I could not recommend this place less.
