ucgzkl7atsBMGu4gGpmHfw Fact: I've been walking past this Queen Street bistro for years and stepped in for the first time,for lunch, two days ago: Wow...I've been missing out on the best quesadilla's ever (cheesy, steamy goodness? Check. Savory? Check. Ample amount of sour cream side-serving? Check). The filling of the quesadilla was so appetizing, the portion amount was substantial (enough to stuff me, and leave enough to doggy-bag home for my boyfriend....who raved about the tastiness of the leftovers) and the price incredibly reasonable. I noticed that the cesar salad my friend ordered looked delicious, complete with bodacious leafy greens topped with huge slivers of parm, and she remarked on the ample size of the serving. 
     Love sitting in booth's? Me too! Dating and single and looking for a casual, charming place to have a little "getting to know you session" over lunch or dinner? This place is it! The atmosphere qualifies as being definitively " cozy bistro" complete with a well-worn, much-loved vibe. Bonus: a cute outdoor patio, with the requisite amount of flaura and fauna, and the sounds of the city hovering comfortably over the fence. 
     So: judging from how my friend's were raving about their meals and the chattering of a packed Friday lunch crowd, I'm willing to bet the other dishes on the menu were equally as delicious. 
     In terms of service, our waitress, although obviously very busy, was polite, attentive and our meal was quickly served, the dishes all coming out together, in perfect synchronicity (awful, isn't it, when you're out eating and everyone's plates arrive, while you are left to chew on your own fist? Hate that). 
     Nothing communicates "successful restaurant" faster than a bustling, eating, chattering crowd of patrons, all smiling into their plates and eating like lions: this is the scene at Peter Ban Bistro: Go!
