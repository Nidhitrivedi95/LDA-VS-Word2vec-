XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q Food was great. Hubs and I both got the 4 course each. The amuse bouches that came out in between courses were delish. My fave was probably the Lobster Salad while the hubs enjoyed the Langoustine Ravioli. Each dish was artfully presented w/ flavors to match.

Great selection on the bread cart and the dessert cart was a feast for the eyes. The establishment was very Parisian chic.

We were running late and they were able to accommodate us. The only complaint is that we had mentioned that it was a birthday/anniversary celebration and unlike other places that gave us a dessert or something special, this place didn't. Another table celebrating a birthday received something.
