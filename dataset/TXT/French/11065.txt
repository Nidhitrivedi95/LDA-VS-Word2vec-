4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Amazing- we had a working lunch at an outside table with climate control. Our server, Ryan, was professional, knowledgable, quick, humble, confident, a great listener and had a fabulous smile; and he served us quickly. Ironically, they messed up my order (granted- I asked for subs) but he fixed it promptly and it was so good, I would order it again. In case your curious- I got the fillet of grilled chicken, Brie, Granny Smith apples and caramelized onions with butter lettuce leaves instead of bread and a side of mixed fruit. I pared it with cold champagne and it was fabulous. My colleagues loved their meals as well. The view of people watching and the Bellagio was super fun too. I would highly recommend this place.
