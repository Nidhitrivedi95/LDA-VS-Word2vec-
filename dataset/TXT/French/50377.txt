ovtlrcsVRlgZZQUlHs_ovw Great dinner.  The hamburgers and french fries were great.  People in our group also tried meatloaf and french onion soup.  Everyone really liked what they ordered.  The ambiance is very cool and interesting.  Our server was excellent.  It was a very good experience and we will definitely return.
