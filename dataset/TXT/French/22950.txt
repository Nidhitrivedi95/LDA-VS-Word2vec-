bzbNGyrTwWHAgg1CqkSgeg I have now been here for breakfast, lunch and dinner, and all 3 were amazing.  At breakfast, my party all tried a bit of everything...one dish was better than the next.  The pancakes were the best I have had in any restaurant in years and the quiche is beyond description.  No doubt why this place was voted best breakfast in Charlotte. At lunch, my dad had salmon with steamed veggies, which was a genorous  and very tasty lunch portion, and I had the hummus appetizer and grilled cheese.  If you enjoy hummus, this one is not to be missed.  Portion size was LARGE and hummus was delightful.  At dinner, we ordered from the Valentines price fixe menu; we each had crab bisque, filet mignon, lobster and dessert; all were exceptional.  Breakfast, lunch or dinner, you will not be disappointed....TRY TERRACE CAFE!!!!!!!!!!!
