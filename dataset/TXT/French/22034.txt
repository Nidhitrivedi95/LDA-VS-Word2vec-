bRmb81XDG3E2SOHARBLTog Went here with my boyfriend and best friend for her 20th birthday. First thing that I felt as we walked in, the servers didn't really take us seriously. Most of the patrons there looked a lot older than us(business folks). It took forever for our server to take our orders (even our drink orders) and the restaurant was relatively empty. 

When our food finally came, the portion sizes were on the smaller side. I was really shocked at the size of my boyfriend's steak though. It was minuscule! And to be honest, his plate didn't look good what so ever. Also, my paella was supposed to come with mussels but it came with chicken instead. Our server didn't inform me that they ran out of mussels when I ordered. 

The ambiance is really nice though.
