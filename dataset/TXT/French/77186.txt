YUFxSG6idHePsxOmnSHtpQ I was disappointed on my last visit.   The food was "okay", but I expect exceptional when I pay for a meal.  I was also surprised by the waiting staff.  They were not very friendly, and made me feel that I was taking too much time sitting at the table...even though there were numerous open tables available.
