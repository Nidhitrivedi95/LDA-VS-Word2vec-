My boyfriend and I went to celebrate a special occasion and we were able to bring a special bottle of wine we had been saving for such an event.  I agree that the food is a little pricey but I think it was very good.  I am not sure what Nita is talking about when she says its like deli food, I didn't get that impression at all.  I will definitely be back for another fun occasion or celebration when I am in Phoenix.
