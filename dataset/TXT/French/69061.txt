w1BbvLeKBSKBnlALLhPmGg I was expecting so much more for the price. The interior design promises so much more that is actually being delivered. If you look closely, everything there looks a bit tired. The floor look like is has been there since middle ages, chairs are falling apart, the tables are shaky and worn out . I do not even want to know how the kitchen looks like if that was the case in the public area. 
 
The menu was beautifully composed. I was very vast, with many options to choose from. It was nice to be able to compose my own dinner. The chef certainly knows how to cook a steak. It was really good. However again, the bill was definitely not proportionate to what we have received. The standard of food and service is far away from what it desires to be. 
 
Do not even get me started at the brasserie manager. 
 
The best advantage of Malmaison are little restaurants near to it. The Fishers, The Shore, even Granary, deliver far better food and service at proportionate and well deserved prices.
