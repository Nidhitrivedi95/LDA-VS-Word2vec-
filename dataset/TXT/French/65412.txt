u-SvRRAfYgpbXZRfQgcTzA I have been living in Montreal for two years and have lived in Japan for a year and a half. this is DEFINITELY the best, most authentic izakaya I have found. The food is exactly like I remembered it, the service is great and the prices are decent. The drinks are a little pricey but it is absolutely worth it for the atmosphere and the authentic food. 

So many food items are a must have, but I highly recommend the takoyaki (tiny pieces of octopus in a dumpling ball with a salty sauce) even if you're not a fan of seafood it is a delight!

The spicy ramen was equally delicious with the perfect cook on the boiled egg in it. Yummy spicy broth-y egg-y goodness! I wanted to eat 3 more bowls!

Their okonomiyake ( Japanese "pancake") was good, I'm used to the Hiroshima version which has noodles underneath but you could REALLY taste the pickled radish it it and it was delicious.

With echoes of Sake BOMB in the background, this place is great if you're looking for genuine Japanese izakaya food. Make sure to write your thanks on the chalkboard wall downstairs :)

GOCHISOUSAMA DESHITA!!
