aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw I had no idea this bakery was so revered...  This has been my favorite bakery/place for breakfast in Vegas since my first visit here.  Not surprised though - Yelpers know their shit and Thomas Keller is a god  :)

Best croissants ever.  Get them when they're fresh.

The macarons are amazing.  I always buy the gift box for about twenty bucks, and see if I can resist opening it and eating them until I get home.  Usually makes it till about the plane ride back.

More stuff you should try: the beignets filled with raspberry will put any doughnut to shame (and I AM an avid Krispy Kreme fan), the chocolate bouchons are heavenly, and as someone else said here, the best Red Velvet Cupcake I've ever had, in the world, ever, period.  Better than Magnolia Bakery.  Better than the ones I had in Georgia.  

Also, they make a damn good cup of coffee here.  Don't even bother with Starbuck's.
