4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw If you're visiting the strip, this restaurant has THE BEST LOCATION. It's perfect for catching the Bellagio fountain show, soaking up some nice fresh air, and people watching :) Food is pretty standard for the strip....good quality but over-priced. Good service!

I came here for brunch with some girlfriends, and I ordered the salmon eggs benedict. The egg was poached well and the hollandaise was light, but the english muffin was a little hard (like it had been sitting out for a while). My friends each ordered a crepe, which they said were tasty, and we shared a super delicious and creamy baked goat cheese appetizer.....drool! My only complaint about that was there wasn't enough bread for the cheese! haha

I've heard the steak & frites is good, so that's on the docket for next time!

*Tip: reservations are only for inside seating...if you want to snag a table outside on the patio, come early!
