gISrxk4A5dfrjDivkC-L-Q My sister-in-law was recently in Paris and highly recommended the Angelina's hot chocolate that is available in Toronto's Yonge and Eglinton district at Douce France (along with a zillion other rare French treats in-store). Today we stopped, sat at one of the pretty tables and shared the hot chocolate, following the instructions of the lovely Parisian shopkeeper. You pour the beverage into your teacup, add the fresh whipped cream with a spoon (no stirring), then drink up until you get a creamy moustache. Fun! It's thick and chocolatey but not too sweet, hot but not scorching, and very, very special. A nice change from everyday Tim Horton's or hockey arena hot chocolate. Everyone should try this treat at least once, and help keep this nice little local business ... in business.
