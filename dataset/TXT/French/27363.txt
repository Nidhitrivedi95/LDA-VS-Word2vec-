dDKhRQlw_OVsPLQAGAeNyA The restaurant must have been having an off night because this was my most disappointing French dining experience ever and I don't think I am that finicky. Service was on the slow side, although we were only 1 of  3 tables seated. Meager side salad. Fish of the day: cod, although flakey, was the most unimaginative preparation of baked fish I have ever had - flavorless, with bits of carrots and broccoli on top???  Chutney or a nice salsa on top would have been nice. Bok choy: overcooked to the point of mush - prefer my veggies al dente, thank you very much.  Bf was kind enough to give me a couple bites of his palatable manicotti to erase my negative entree experience :-(.   Dessert failed to save the day, as alas, even the carrot cake was mediocre.
