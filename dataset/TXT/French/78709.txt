ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug This was the worst dining experience I've had in a while. 
First, we got seated in the worst spot possible. Right by the door, near the kitchen.... there were a ton of open tables, ones with views of the hotel and shops, real cute, looks like a cafe on the streets of Paris.... not for us though.
Then, the service was sloooooow, took forever before our waitress even came by. 
I had to ask for water, and that took forever as well. 
She just threw a loaf of cold bread on our table. 
Husband liked the french dip... only thing that saved this.
Fries... it looked like the bottom of a chip bag, all the crumsb, only lacking any flavor! and cold.
The french onion soupd was ok, but sweet. 
Ceasar salad.... guess I shouldn't had ordered this since it was a french restraunt.... bland, and I didn't the chick I ordered. She then said "Oh yeah" came back and threw a plate of very cold bad chicken on the table. I couldn't even eat it. No apology either. 
Then the bill, she never asked for my rewards card. Charged me for the wrong items as well, which was twice as much than what I ordered. 
I went to complain, but husband was mad and stormed out, I figured it wasn't worth it.
Prices were average, maybe $40 for our entire bill? 
Not worth it, wouldn't recommed at all. Wish we went to Mon Ami Gabi, but husband wanted something plainer.....
