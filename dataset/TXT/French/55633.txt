rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I really dug Bouchon.  The setting was classy, the food was delicious, and ambiance really put it all together.  

Bouchon starts off the table with the classic: bread and butter http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A?select=fXfqzKdLWyLTFWk4sJ7HkQ

I usually gauge a restaurant by what kind of bread they serve.  It usually represents what is to come.  The bread was very fresh.  It was shaped like a wheat stalk, which conveniently breaks off to share.  The butter was soft, nutty, and smooth.  Pistachios were a nice touch too.

To start, I ordered the duck confit. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A?select=I9glHwUtGX9sGvokK4fPPg

This truly was the highlight of my meal.  There's something about duck confit.  The whole process changes the duck leg.  It tastes better than a normal preparation.  The outside was crispy and the inside meat was beyond tender.  It simple fell apart.  It came with some greens, peaches, and a sauce that perfectly melded the flavors.

For my plat principaux, I enjoyed a Croque Madame.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A?select=SR73vxNb49DOALh-gDtazQ

I've never had a ham and cheese sammie in such style.  The brioche was rich with a tender crumb.  The fried egg was perfectly cooked and overflowing with mornay sauce.  You're going to need a fork and knife with this one.  It came with a side of frites.  Nom.

I was able to sneak...I mean sample friends meals.

The quick notes: 

Steak Frites - I enjoyed it, but if your not used to a flatiron steak it's not for you.  My friend did not approve of this cut.

Saumon Poele - Great flavor, texture, and cooked perfectly.  Highly recommended.  

Gnocchi a la Parisienne - Best gnocci I have ever eaten.  Period

Eat here.  You need it.   You want it.
