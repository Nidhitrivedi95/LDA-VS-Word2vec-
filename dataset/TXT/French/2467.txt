0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g The BF and I decided to bring his younger brother here to celebrate his 26th birthday. I had eaten here a few years ago and I was hopeful that Picasso would be as good as I remembered. I was thrilled that it was every bit as good as I remembered. 

Since we were in a festive mood, we ordered the Menu Dégustation. They also offered a wine pairing and I must admit that every wine paired perfectly with each dish. This should really not come as a surprise given that Picasso boasts an impressive wine menu. 

Our meal consisted of: 
* An amuse bouche of seasonal soup 
* Maine Lobster Salad with Apple-Champagne Vinaigrette -- the flavors complemented, but did not overpower, the delicate lobster 
* Pan Seared Sea Scallops with Potato Mousseline and Jus de Veau -- the scallops were perfectly cooked 
* Sautéed "A" Steak of Foie Gras with Roasted Peaches, Vanilla, Muscat and Crushed Almonds -- the crushed almonds make this dish because they provide a contrasting texture; I actually preferred the taste of this foie gras dish to the one at Restaurant Guy Savoy at Caesars, but that one wins for unique foie gras presentation (see my Yelp of Restaurant Guy Savoy Las Vegas for more detail on that fab meal) 
* Roast Lamb -- the meat was perfectly prepared. They decided to serve a fairly tall piece of lamb on its end for dramatic effect. The server tilted my BF's plate before he set it down and the lamb nearly slid off the plate. I made a joke about it trying to run away and the staff went with the humor. 
* We added the cheese plate and they brought a nice selection
* The desserts were wonderful and this place employs a talented pastry chef. The server caught my reference during dinner that we had a birthday at the table and they had written Happy Birthday in insanely beautiful script in chocolate on the birthday boy's plate with his opera cake. The BF had the apple beggar's purse with calvados and it was lovely. I opted for the molten chocolate cake on our server's recommendation (even though I am SO over molten chocolate cake) and I must admit it was delightful. The center was like a molten truffle. It came with boysenberry ice cream and some poor soul in the kitchen was so kind as to separate out individual segments of fresh boysenberries to adorn my plate. 
* The post dinner truffles and other tiny bites were very good, but no match for the treat cart at Restaurant Guy Savoy.

The atmosphere of this place is utterly beautiful. Be sure to walk around the room and take in all the original Picasso masterpieces. The fresh flowers are gorgeous, especially the display on the large table in the main dining room. 

It's also a hoot to watch the Bellagio fountains spewing outside the restaurant's windows every 15 minutes. Before you leave, step outside on the lakeside patio and catch the fountain show from this vantage point. You really get a sense of how high that water flies into the air. 

Picasso remains a Las Vegas fine dining delight.
