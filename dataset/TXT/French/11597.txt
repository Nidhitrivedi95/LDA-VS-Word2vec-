4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw My Boyfriend and I decided to have a nice dinner on our last night in Vegas. We did not choose wrong. The restaurant is located in Paris right across from the Bellagio fountains. To start, this place is beautiful and sat us very fast. As we sat down a baguette and crab salad are brought to the table. My boyfriend ordered the muscle and corn chowder as an appetizer. This was detectable and hot. We both ordered the steak frites as our main course. This steak literally melted in our mouths. This is easily the best meal I've ever had. Our server was very polite and came around to the table the perfect amount. We had cappuccinos for desert that were velvety and delicious. 

Please eat here if you are looking for a nice meal and a French bistro.
