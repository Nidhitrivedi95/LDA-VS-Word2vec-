WOO81gScY3_VpaIfXFAKpw I'm shocked this place only has 10 reviews considering it's been open for years.  

I feel like I'm straight robbing this place but I'm happy to donate my $15 for a 5 course dinner to the aspiring students of Le Cordon Bleu.

I'm assuming the menu changes periodically but I had the following:

Salmon Tartar - Amuse Bouche
Cream of Mushroom Soup
Lobster and Duck Confit Endive Salad
Technique Salad (Avocado, Egg, Greens)
Filet Mignon with Bernaise Sauce with Poached Vegetables
Trio of Profiteroles

As you can see, it is a steal for $15.  For 3 dollars less you can get a 3 course dinner but even if you can't finish everything, why not get 2 extra courses and share with a friend/partner. Everything was really good.  I really enjoyed the soups and salads most.

I also thoroughly enjoyed making pitstops to the bathroom.  On the way, there is a huge kitchen where you can watch all the aspiring chefs preparing your food.  My party most have thought I had a tiny bladder because I went back 5 times to do what I do best - STALK.

As great a deal as this was, there were plenty of open tables.  

A part of me wanted to hold back from writing this review so it would be my little secret, but then again I have discovered many gems from other fellow Yelpers so I must help pay it forward.

Visit this place and support our future chefs - It is a hell of a deal!
