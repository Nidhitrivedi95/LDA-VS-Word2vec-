OZC42gnhlJ_auXduDRfMoQ I am going to update this review, because it really wasn't worth 4 stars simply for the good location and cool remodel. Truthfully, the food was bad and the service was bad, because there was only one waiter in the whole place. He was doing his best but it just wasn't enough. AND they ran out of croissants. What french place runs out of croissants? I'm still a little upset about it a week later.
