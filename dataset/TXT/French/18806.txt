ajjFfYbNbij-msLfX8KgLA Enjoyed our meal at the Paris Cafe so much signed up for one of their special events when I returned home. The service is spot on and our selections pleasant. We started with the Rabbit/Duck Liver Appetizer and it was more gelatinous and firm versus creamy and spreadable, but very tasty and subtle in flavor. I ordered the Crepes Collete. A chicken, mushroom crepe with a pleasant bechamel sauce. My companion ordered the Crab Cakes and they were nicely flavored. Just enough mustard etc., over a win. The bar drinks is also spot on. My only advics that during the winter, take a seat in the back of the restaurant because the restaurant though cute is shotgun style and when the door opens even the center seating will be blasted with cold air. Seating is also very tightly packed. Maybe a foot between most of the tables. There are a few with more space, so if yoh need space reserve a larger table area in advance. The restaurant was packed within twenty minutes of opening their doors! Recommend.
