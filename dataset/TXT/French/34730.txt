It was for a friend's birthday dinner and the manager okayed me bringing in an outside cake for the birthday boy. The hostess staff was very helpful. The server introduced herself to me that she'd be taking care of the big group I was with before everyone showed up and was very helpful with facilitating the birthday cake surprise after dinner. Her recommendations on what to eat was very helpful: the bone marrow and oxtail jam was the best! All in all: great service and very friendly staff.
