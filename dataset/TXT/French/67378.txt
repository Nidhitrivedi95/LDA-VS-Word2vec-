This place is wonderful. I've been a few times now and always found it busy, but never so busy they haven't got a little table for two somewhere. The staff are what I'd call modern French. Having lived in France for a while, the traditional french waiter is being replaced by young, lively, friendly types, great examples of which are found here.

Now for the food. I had coq-au-vin. Not just any coq-au-vin, probably the best coq-au-vin I've ever had. My mouth is still watering now thinking about it. It has that deep rich taste, perfectly cooked. top marks.

I had a glass or two of Cote du rhone which went perfectly and all for a respectable price. I've tried a few French places now in Edinburgh, still finding it difficult to find better than this. Allez-y!
