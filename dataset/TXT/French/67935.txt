v50-nvBCZNf7nCNbyUlQLw Absolutely delicious! Love the Icelandic smoked salmon crepe and the Nutella crepe. However, they are almost never open and the older gentleman (who I assume to be upper management) can be quite rude!

I have been there a few times and have no problem with the younger servers at all, who have actually been extremely pleasant and friendly. My biggest complaint is the manager/owner who literally hung up on me not but five minutes ago!! Had it not been for him, I would have given it 4 stars.

If you don't mind potentially rude service, I would recommend giving it a try. On the other hand, sometimes it's not worth it.
