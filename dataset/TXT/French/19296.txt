aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw Based solely on their macarons and peanut butter cookie sandwich this bakery has the BIGGEST Macarons I've seen and also the most EXPENSIVE!  Nested inside the Venetian hotel hidden behind its theater, this bakery usually has a long line and by the time you get to the front everything is sold out! Their actual restaurant location is near the clock tower--but I'm not sure if they offer bakery items. 

I ordered the salted caramel and chocolate macarons and would say they are comparable to Ginger Elizabeth in Sacramento--just two times bigger and more expensive! Not sure what all the hype is surrounding this place? Yes, their macarons are soft and chewy--but what macaron isn't? Their peanut butter cookies with cream in between was OVERLY sweet and honestly tasted worse than an Oreo. Maybe I ordered the wrong flavors but either way there was nothing AMAZING about this bakery. 

Overall, Bouchon is like the Chanel of macaron bakeries!  (Probably why they think it's Ok to overcharge everyone.)  While smaller, less famous, Dooney and Burke level bakeries, price their macarons at $1.75 MAX and taste exactly the same. 

If you want something MOUTH WATERING visit the French Laundry in Yountville! Same owner but the food there is to die for!! Definitely worth the money versus these small desserts!
