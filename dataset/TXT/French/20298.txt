atNpoWy_XrhT9EUIEP6azg I had bookmarked this place because I had read a review that said at the happy hour, which runs 3 to 6 p.m. including Saturday and Sunday, "Oysters are only $1 each and all wines by the glass are $2 off, but guests can linger of a complimentary cheese plate if they purchase a full-priced bottle of wine. And this is one of the best, biggest, most elegant cheese plates in the city. I swear I have tried most of them," which I incorrectly attributed to a fellow Yelper but, really, had read in a MetroMix post on AzCentral, so I should not be too surprised that the cheese plate was WEAK and IF I had paid for it I would have been VERY disappointed: 3 slices of smoked gouda, 6 slices of white American and two thin squares of Blue. There was a mound of fruit relish (I'm guessing currants, though our server never did confirm) and a splash of preserve (guessing strawberry, but it had no real purpose any way, except to decorate the plate). 

The toasted bread that accompanied the cheese plate was good and there were inexpensive options for bottles, which I had not anticipated. 

That said, the oysters really were only $1 each and though not a connoisseur, I thought they tasted fresh and delicious and that WAS confirmed by my happy hour companions who do consider themselves connoisseurs. 

So, my point: happy hour is good here. Go for the oysters. Skip the cheese plate. You can do better sampling at the deli counter at Fry's.
