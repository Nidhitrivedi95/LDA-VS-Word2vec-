Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA Came here to enjoy the lounge, drinks and view on an impromptu anniversary getaway. 

The view: awesome. 5 stars. Very few places in Vegas can give you this all-encompassing view (the only thing that screws it up a bit is the City Center blocking the Bellagio).

The drinks: expensive but tasty. We came here for the company, view and ambience, not the drinks. With that said, the drinks were tasty but both my wife and I are too cheap to buy more than 1 each (which we felt like would be the minimum). 

The scene: we came on a Tuesday evening knowing that it would be empty and quiet (which is what we wanted - we're getting old!) And I believe this enhanced the view and the experience. 

I can imagine this place getting really dense/tight/crowded on the weekend (I would probably stay away). But if we're in Vegas mid-week, we would probably come again.
