In the end we decided both menus were equally good and if we could combine the two, mix and match a bit, it would be even better!

Of course, I am sure the menus will change depending on the season and availability of the food.  

Our 2 favorites were:
Scallop from Chef's choice menu: the chef's creativity in pairing a strained lamg ragout with fresh scallop was the highlight for me.  

Veal from the tasting menu - best veal I had ever had. It was absolutely amazing. The sauce was complex, the texture of the veal was perfect and the taste was sophisticated which is not a word I would usually describe veal.

I can't believe other reviewers are complaining about the "tiny portions"...hum...that's what a tasting menu is!  We eat out at expensive fancy places all the time and honestly, I think this is one of the best. I love the fact that they ONLY have the tasting menus so that the chef can focus on perfecting these dishes each evening for his diners.

Whether you frequent fine-dining establishments or if you are up to try something new in Vegas, this is a good choice.  BTW, very romantic ambiance, overlooking the Bellagio's incredible fountain.
