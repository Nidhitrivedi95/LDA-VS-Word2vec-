SD7vTf-H00J8BS3L-kt7jg After arriving at the nicely decorated and boisterous room I was asked what I wanted to drink. I picked regular water and received a small glass of lukewarm water no ice though I noticed bottled water was nicely chilled. Hmm not a good sign but I persevered. Had a rather dreary and greasy burger which I could not finish, then paid the $25 tab vowing never to return. 
A very discouraging experience.
