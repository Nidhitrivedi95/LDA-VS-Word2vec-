hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA Love this place!

I've been many times and will continue to go. I love sandwiches and they have the best prosciutto sandwich! It was bits of walnuts in the mayo. The salads are good, too! I've been for breakfast and its a perfect amount. I had the croissant breakfast sandwich... I wanted to go back for seconds! I've had the quiche once. I love quiche but I felt their quiche lorraine had way too many onions. So that's off for me. But that's ok because everything else I've had is super good.

Their desserts are so yummy! I get the chocolate tart and its spot on every time! 

The owners are very friendly and happy to make suggestions. The guys are very good looking too with a nice French accent.
