SFnrHuVFSNiondFVUBLJZQ We ate here our  first night in Montréal.  We picked it at random and were not disappointed. The food was delish. We did cheese fondue, which was awesome!  They had lots of great dinner and dessert crepe choices. We came back for brunch and had excellent dessert crepes, and the French onion soup is a must! The staff was attentive and friendly, and the ambiance had a cute corner café feel. A gem in a bit of a touristy area.
