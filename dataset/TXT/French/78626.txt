ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug I had a great experience here for breakfast there was a line to wait for a seat but the line is deceiving. The wait was maybe 5 minutes to sit down. The staff was very nice, my waitress was Toni. Toni was super sweet and quick! 

I got the corn beef hash and eggs. It was awesome I enjoyed it and have no complaints!
