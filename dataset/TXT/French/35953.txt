hvjgF-vnPw2jyL5DBuB0qg I am completely obsessed with Chuck Hughes. Whenever he's on tv, I watch him. I've got a Google alert set up to read anything anyone has ever written about him. I've watched every episode of Chuck's Day Off, Week Off, Eats The Streets--religiously, hoping for the day that I'd be able to visit Garde Manger and possibly taste the famed lobster poutine.

According to the internets, you have to have a reservation newly a month in advance. I was traveling in Montreal sooo, so I took a chance and arrived at the restaurant right before 5 p.m., hoping to snag a table just for myself. The restaurant has no signage or street number posted on the door. It's almost as if you have to "be in the know" to know exactly where it is. Due to construction on the street to prepare for the 375th anniversary of the city, it was even that much more difficult to navigate past open holes in the street and narrow passageways to get there. Lucky me: there was ONE seat at the bar (where I prefer to eat anyhow) and the bartender took good care of me. I went in for poutine and stayed for the lovely, bustling atmosphere. 

There is one menu but it's written in chalk on two boards, in French and in English. I read Yelp reviews that said to stay away from the poutine because it wasn't worth the hype, but I didn't listen and I'm glad I didn't. It was one of the best dishes I've ever had at a restaurant. Being a Southern lady, I am well-versed in the language of gravy and the gravy is what made the poutine spectacular. There was PLENTY of fat, succulent pieces of lobster and the curds were melted just slightly under and on top of the piping hot pommes frites. I had a glass of wine and happily wobbled my way back to my AirBnB.

For anyone contemplating going to Garde Manger, do make reservations and do get the poutine. It says market price on the menu and don't let that scare you away. It ended up being ~$15 CAD.
