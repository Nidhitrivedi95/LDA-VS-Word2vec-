rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I normally do my rating based mainly on food quality but being that this restaurant is pricey, I believe we pay for the service too. 

Service: Horrible. I came with a bachelorette party. Our server was rude to us. He was being impatient. I think it should be expected that when we come with a group this large (16 ppl) it may take us some extra time to order. The server wasn't giving us adequate time and was rushing us. Also there was this negative attitude about the server that just dampened our mood. He made dinner unpleasant. Other than that, they had our table ready when we arrived. Everyone else did a fine job but it was just our main server we all had a problem with. 

Food: Everyone enjoyed their food and there were no complaints. 

- Seared Foie Gras: Great. Wasnt over cooked. It was super simple and placed on a broiche but that created a perfect blend. 
- Muscles:The muscles were yummy too. The sauce was perfectly creamy. Not too intense. The muscles werent chewy. However, the fries that came with it weren't the best. Seemed a bit too dry.
-Mushroom Side: The side of mushrooms were definitely addicting and the side was large enough to share with 3 people. 
-Salmon Tar Tar: I'm not a fan of salmon however their tar tar was just perfect. It wasn't fishy and I really recommend this dish to everyone. 

Summary, food amazing, service crap.
