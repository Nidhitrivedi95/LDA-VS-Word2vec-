YH8Bn-7pLR-SFR8MCgQj1w I came here to grab some pastries and was pretty disappointed when I walked into Jules Cafe.

Jules Cafe is a tiny narrow place that sells baked goods, lunch, candy; they also have a coffee bar and very few tables that are cramped together in the back. There was no board up or anything listing their goods or prices when I came here, which left me in confusion. Behind their glass counter there was barely anything left except for a few billion year old looking quiche slices and croc monsieur.

The lady here was very friendly and helpful. I was looking to get an iced coffee beverage as it was boiling hot outside, but they don't offer any iced coffee beverages. I ended up picking out a couple of danishes and a couple of almond croissants from a basket which barely had anything left. For these four small items it cost a little over $10, which I think is pretty pricy considering its size and quality. I've had better!

The blueberry and custard danish were sweet, flakey and good but a tad bit stale. The almond croissant was also flakey and had a nice sweet and gooey almond cream filling in the middle. Unfortunately, the croissants were a bit stale too. I find the staleness quite surprising because of the hype of their pastries here.

Overall, Jules Cafe Patisserie did not impress me. Their croissants and danish were not fresh, the place lacked goods when I was there, and the prices are a bit high at this place.
