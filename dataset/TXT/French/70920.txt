xBxDMEkFK5GBhiy-8gGE9w Great location right at the Place de Arts so it was fantastic to get to the comedy festival. Interesting design, kind of like a little glass box. Great views of the street life and the festival. Very friendly and efficient staff. We started with some New Brunswick oysters, the garlic sea snails and the chicken liver pate. All were very, very good. For the main course I had the beef tartare with frites and my wife had the special which was halibut topped with caviar and with deep fried clams on the side. Tried the Griffon white and red beers and both were great. Fantastic dinner on our final night in Montreal. Can't wait to come back.
