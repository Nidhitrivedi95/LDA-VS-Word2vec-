jaSowNITPRRCYpPb3_pjdA Andre's Bistro has finally hit its stride.  The food has always been good - we've been three times, but the service in the past was poor.  This last visit on Friday was outstanding.  The food was delicious and our server could not have been better (thanks Nathaniel!), along with the other help.  I attribute this to the review in the LVRJ newspaper that mentioned the poor service.  What a turnaround!  

As for the food, we had lunch - French onion soup (excellent), a chicken sandwich and a burger, with, of course, duck fat fries.  The chicken sandwich was declared to be delicious and my burger was one of the best I've had.  Perfectly cooked with great condiments.  The bread and butter are both wonderful.  

Overall, we can highly recommend Andre's Bistro.
