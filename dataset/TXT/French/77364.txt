YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g As a vegetarian, Fleur had a dedicated and appealing vegetarian menu. However, their dishes lacked salt and the service was a bit fragmented on a slow night. We had tarte flambé, rococo pepper, black garlic edamame. The tarte flambé was amazing (but then again is there a truffle dish that is not amazing?). The garlic edamame was nothing special and the rococo pepper could have had more seasoning. If you want tapas in Vegas, go to Julianne Serrano at aria.
