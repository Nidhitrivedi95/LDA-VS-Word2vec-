I had a rather disappointing visit to the Golden Steer, where the 22 oz bone-in Ribeye steak came out dry and tough.  At $55, I wasn't too happy about the experience.  That same night, made reservations for Mon Ami Gabi for the next day prior to flying out.

While perusing the menu, noticed the lunch menu only offered the standard steak-frites (3:00pm arrival) so I asked our server if the other larger cuts of steak were available, which they were off menu, hooray!  While I enjoy the steak used for this popular namescake, I prefer a little more thickness in my cuts.  I requested their bone-in Ribeye and let her know that I prefer rare but with a seared exterior, so she let me know that she would put it down as rare plus.  We were seated inside but right in the glass walled area so had great views of the Bellagio fountains and people watching, always a gem out on the strip.

When my steak arrived, I approached the cut with trepidation but there was no seeping of the juices, which meant the steak sat for the correct amount of time to ensure a tender cut.  Hooray!  It was charred perfectly on the outside giving it just enough roughness on the exterior but the rare on the inside was perfect.  The marbling was also not too much, but the adequate layers and crannies of fat gave the steak more flavor and texture.

I didn't touch the french fries since I had nibbled on their amazing french bread earlier and declined dessert.  

Overall, another 5 out of 5 for one of my favorite places on the strip.
