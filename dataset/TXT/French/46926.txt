noCKeynzdlWBQsVsAFZMpA We ate dinner here on 04-Nov-2017 and the experience was fantastic! While the food was delightful, the cocktails and wine were even better -- and the service was phenomenal. Our waiter (can't remember his name because of the cocktails, but he was relatively new to Pittsburgh from Denver), knew all of the menus inside-and-out, was enthusiastic about the choices, and gave us great advice. We loved every single minute here and will definitely be back.
