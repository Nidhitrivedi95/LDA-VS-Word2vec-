_cjPEH9wXhKS-HQe_U3M4Q Came to Le Sélect Bistro for a Christmas GNO dinner. We loved it!
Service was great and the food quality was good. For my friends that drove here, they complimented on the availability of parking space.

DRINKS:
MERLOT/CAB 

CONFIT DE CANARD (4/5)
(duck leg confit with crispy skin, served with veggies, potatoes au gratin)

Mm.. this was so yummy!! There's an option for one / two duck legs - I should've ordered two!! The duck leg size was not that big so if you're hungry I would suggest you order two duck legs. My friend and I grabbed snacks after dinner because we were still hungry.. but this duck confit was so delicious! I'd come back and order this again :)
