SBnpT6JDbah-5l_52GM5sw This is one of my favorite places for brunch. Dinners are quite good, generally end up ordering the steamed mussels or braised pork currently. Though in the past, their skate was incredible. My favorite dish on the menu is the charcuterie plate. Hands down, this is the best meat-centric dish in town (sorry Graze), mostly because of the duck liver pate. Desserts are also worth saving room for, especially the chocolate cake.
