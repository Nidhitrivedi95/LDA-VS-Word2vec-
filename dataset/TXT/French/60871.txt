SD7vTf-H00J8BS3L-kt7jg The food here was great, and the location is awesome, but sometimes when you start off on the wrong foot it's tough to give a great overall rating.

I was in meetings separately from my team that afternoon and asked that the team pick a place and make the reservations. So they did. I was first to arrive and said I was there for a reservation under the two names that could have made the reservation. The fact that I mentioned 2 names got me an eye roll from the bearded guy at the door (who at a minimum I would guess is a Manager / GM). I attempted to clarify by stating the time....blank look....until I was asked "for how many?"  I said "4 or 5" as I was not sure what the final numbers were because I was not with my team when they made the reservation. The response back was...."Well how am I supposed to know which reservation is yours?

Anyways - I got seated. From then on the rest of the evening was great. Our waiter was very pleasant and helpful, the cocktails were reasonable (I am a bit of a snob on that area), the wine list was very good and the steaks, tartares, and carpaccios were excellent. 

As the evening went on, the music started to get a little louder and more people were around the bar, so it had a great fun atmosphere, very lively.  Next time I will come a bit later and grab a spot with friends at the bar and I'm sure the rating will improve.
