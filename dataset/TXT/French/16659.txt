8ciT6qjI18x9EPtOb-gqYQ My First Date at Coup Des Tartes,
I can't give this restaurant the fifth star because of a few drawbacks.  3.5 star review if I could

I have driven by the restaurant many times and thought Coup Des Tartes sounds like a French restaurant, great, there are not to many in the area.  Then I read the yelp reviews and thought this was a great place to take a date.  Its small, with a home dinning area atmosphere, and the staff seemed very nice.  The date went well so I have to give the restaurant a thank you for that. My date and I overstayed our visit and non of the employees minded another nice note.  

Don't let the name lead you to think this restaurant is a French restaurant because it is not.  The definition of a French restaurant starts with French area ingredients and preparation.  Coup Des Tartes does not focus on  either. 

Overall a nice place for a small restaurant atmosphere and quality food.
