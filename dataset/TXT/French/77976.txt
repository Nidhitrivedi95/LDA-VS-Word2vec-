YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g Yes! Everything about this evening was amazing; I wouldn't expect anything less.  This was our splurge night with friends so we were 100% aware of price and cuisine. We made a reservation but didn't feel it was necessary - no one was there at 7pm on a Saturday; by the time we left around 9:30pm it was still empty. 

We picked 3 appetizers; beef carpaccio (we ordered seconds!); escargot; gnocchi & short ribs = all amazing.  

We then ordered 2 caesar salads & split them; definitely enough for 4 adults. The dressing was on point.

Entrees: Fleur burger (added f.g. & truffle) - "best burger ever" as described from our friend; scallops - cooked perfectly + beets (my favorite!!!); my husband ordered the beef cheeks - so flaky soft, the pieces melted in your mouth... if you're a skeptic, it was like a very tender stew, but 100x better; 8 oz hanger steak - cooked perfectly to medium rare, melt in your mouth... our friend had to force herself to stop eating so she could save room for dessert. Talk about self control!

I can't freaking remember the desserts. Oh my gosh. Whatever, they were good, lol! 

It's a treat to eat here and I'm glad we did, one more celebrity chef to check off my list. A+++++!
