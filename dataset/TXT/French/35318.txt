Ht-_i0UAq7YDBaqJwcQMdQ A charming old town restaurant serving fine  Montreal French cuisine, which typically tends to be laced with too much maple syrup. They do a better job of not over powering the sweetness compared to others in town. 
Exceptional food, extensive French wine list and service. I had two appetizers for dinner, hamachi tartar and smoke octopus served with fresh garbanzo beans. My colleagues had the duck, scallops, char, etc. The winning dish for me was the  piglet risotto with fois gras.  It was rich and decadent.  Will definitely be back for more.
