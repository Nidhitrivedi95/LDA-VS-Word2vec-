COgwFthJpS4We16W5Gf4lw Wwwwwwwwwooooooooooowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww!!  This place is awesome!!!  My wife and I went for our first wedding anniversary after such great reviews of this place and it was right on the $.  

We couldn't believe the nice place we walked into on that side of Sahara but it's like you're transported into a different place where no one is in a rush..a meal is a MEAL and it's first class all the way.  Our eccentric waiter, Keifer, was funny and entertaining although I am not sure how anyone remembers the specials of the day after 1 listen...so many to choose from!!

My wife and I both agreed the French onion soup was the best we've ever had!!  I never actually thought it could ever be this good!  We went with the specials for entrees.  I got the fruit de mare which consisted of pasta with shrimp, scallops and a lobster tail with lobster cognac sauce over the whole thing...unreal....and $29 to boot which isn't bad at all!!  My wife went with the veal and that was incredible.  Best veal ever.  

We also pre-ordered the amazing baked souffle and they also gave us a nice extra dessert for our 1st anniversary.  

All in all just a wonderful way to eat with the one you love.  Keifer suggested we come back for our 2nd anniversary but I honestly think we won't be able to wait a whole year to come back!!!
