4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw My first time in Las Vegas. I wanted to find a romantic place that was different, classy and fun. I found it in Mon Ami Gabi. My girlfriend and I took the slow gastro route and slowly ate and imbibed for over 2 1/2 hours. We never felt rushed and our waitress was awesome. Attentive but not intrusive. She would periodically come and check on us, top off our wine and disappear. Wonderful service. 

Upon seating we were topped off with water and brought a hot loaf of bread with butter and a dip that looked like carrot that was tasty and welcomed as we checked out the menu. 

We had escargot, and tuna tartar as appetizers. And shared the Hanger steak as an entree which was cooked to medium rare perfection. I would highly recommend this place to anyone but I would advise reservations and outdoor patio seating as the inside did not look so appealing due to the space, noise, although it was nice and dark which I like. Another added benefit to seating outside is you get to people watch (which is very entertaining on the Las Vegas strip) and you get to watch the bellagio water show.
