KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA We have been dining at MB for years, but the last few times have been so disappointing!  The most recent was this evening.  We had made reservations for 6 through Open Table, and when we arrived, they claimed they did not have the reservation.  This meant we would not be seated on the patio.  We waited for 30 minutes to see if they could accommodate us, the best they could do was to seat us inside.  The service was terrible. Everything from waiting way too long to take our order to not keeping water glasses full and even getting our entree order incorrect.  I'm not a difficult customer, but the service here has become insufficient.  I'm not sure what is happening at this place, but we have given them too many excuses... NOT going back.
