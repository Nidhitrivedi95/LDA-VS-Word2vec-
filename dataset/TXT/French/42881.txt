The croissants and pains au chocolat are really not so bad although not chewy enough on the inside.  
What i really don't like is the poorly planned seating area with communal tables and ugly chairs.  To me, it has an airport atmosphere and clearly you don't want to share a table with overweight Bridget Jones-like girls who believe they're having a French immersive experience by eating there.  
Take away your food.
