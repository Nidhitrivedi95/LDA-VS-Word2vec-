0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g Really wanted this place to be great, but it just wasnt.  

After checking out the various new Vegas options, my wife and I made our reservations at Picasso.   We arrived, and did have a great table against the window, with a view of the fountains.   We enjoyed the physical atmosphere, and yes, the paintings are nice, but that was all that got this place the second star. 

As far as the dining experience, it was rushed and unprofessional, with scattered presentation and even more scattered service.  We ordered two tasting menus with wine pairings, and were looking forward to a relaxed evening.  It was not meant to be.  The plates came out one right after the other; I could not believe I was being rushed through a $600 meal...    Half way through I mentioned it to the server, and he offered to let us have desert on the patio.  I dont know if that was supposed to actually make up for it, because it did not really  sound like a great idea to get wet from the fountain blowback.    

The sommelier was literally dripping with sweat, and when I asked him about one of the wines, he pounded out his note card version of his thoughts and ran to another table.  Needless to say, not that relaxing, and not worth the cash.    

The food, you are wondering?   Average.  Seriously, I have have been to plenty of fancy restaurants, and this did not make the short list of good ones.   

We were looking for something remarkable, and if you are too, look elsewhere.  (I was going to give 2 stars, but by the time I got to the end, I was irritated all over again, hence the 1)
