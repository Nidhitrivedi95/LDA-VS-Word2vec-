i2dnic7VdQ3NyiQQWUXHbA I was looking forward to brunch here after seeing it called a hot new restaurant on blogs. But I think I ordered the wrong thing. Against my better judgement, I had the blueberry ricotta pancakes. Now, I'm not normally a person who orders pancakes at restaurants. I make a killer buttermilk pancake recipe and no restaurant pancake has ever lived up to my homemade 'cakes, so I avoid ordering them at restaurants. But something about these pancakes called out to me so I ordered them... and they were just okay. They definitely weren't bad because you'd have to be a terrible cook to make bad pancakes. But they were just okay. Maybe they would have been better if they had come with more than a teaspoon of blueberries. On the plus side, they came with real maple syrup at no extra charge unlike most Ontario restaurants.
