zv92BYJH09YjFQOtSyYp-A Mistake one- not checking reviews
Mistake two- choosing the empty restaurant with the pretty hostess outside
 Sat outside- good " specials"
 menu (see pic) glass of sauv blanc
The salad is on the lean side- see pic
The bread was good- right to my as$
The steak- ordered medium- got it well- lil rubbery. 
Overall- PASS! 
The server and owner YES OWNER Erik- is cold/ distant / robot like. That's what happens when you're 50+ and hate your job- it shows. Never did a touch back or follow up. The host is more attentive. 
Oh well. Lesson learned. 
Is tip included? If not -here it is.... Pretend to care, maybe smile and maybe you would get a tip. Ugh
