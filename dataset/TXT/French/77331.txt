YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g I had an amazing experience here.  I went in to order the Fleur burger.  I ended up ordering 2 of their appetizer plates as well.  All of the food was just incredible.  I got the beef carpachio, the duck terrine, and the Fleur burger with the add ons of truffles and fois gras.  Hubert Keller even happened to be there and came by my table.  The whole experience was beyond my expectations.  I was even given a complimentary dessert from the chef.  It just made the night even more special.  The entire service was spot on.  My water was always topped off and my waiter was just perfect.  Thank you to everyone at Fleur for an incredible dinner!
