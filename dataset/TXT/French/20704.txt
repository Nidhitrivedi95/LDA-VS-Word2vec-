AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw This place makes awesome Crepes!!! They sell chocolates and pastries.

They have breakfast Crepes such as their Crepe Madame with Swiss Cheese, Ham and Egg to the more traditional fruit and chocolate Crepes. Since it is within Ceasar's Palace, they are on the expensive side, $11-15 for Crepes.

Their Espresso and Coffee offering are so-so, but their Crepes more than make up for this.
