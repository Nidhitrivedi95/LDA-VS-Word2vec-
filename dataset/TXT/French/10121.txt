4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Delicious! This place is good. I had the bacon & poached egg frisee salad and it is awesome but the star of the meal is the steak frite. I had the steak bernaise and it was perfectly cooked, huge portion and $23. I have eaten here a few times and it is consistently good. My sister took a few bites of my food and told me it's the best steak frite she ever had. I don't know if I would go that far but it's damn good. Service is friendly and fast. There are a ton of great restaurants in Vegas to try but when your looking for good quality at a reasonable price it's worth going here.
