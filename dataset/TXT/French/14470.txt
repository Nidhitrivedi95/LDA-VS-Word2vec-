We went here last night for Taste of Montreal event. Overall, it was an enjoyable meal with very innovative dishes that were like pieces of art. 

I ordered the pork, short ribs and chocolate cake. My husband ordered the scallop, arctic char and caramalized banana mousse. My husband actually enjoyed my entree and main morw than his. When it came to desserts he enjoyed them equally. I enjoyed my meal, but enjoyed the arctic char as well. It was like butter melting in my mouth. 

1/2 star was taken off due to minor hiccups.
