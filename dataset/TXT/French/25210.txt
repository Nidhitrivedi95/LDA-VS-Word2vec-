Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA After dinner at Mix we walked over to Mix Lounge. We were pretty worn out after dinner, but we enjoyed it. The music was so so, it wasn't very packed so we were happy to find a place to sit. My favorite was the view... The city of las vegas looks fantastic with all of the lights glowing!
