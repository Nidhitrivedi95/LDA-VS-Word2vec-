Le Love

The decoration, the feeling, everything about the ascetics is pleasing. The place is small but because the ceilings are so high, it makes the space look airy. The main chandelier inspired me (meaning I will be ripping it off).

The food is delicious. I've been here three times and I have been trying different things all the time.

1st --was the freshly made fig tart. The figs were fresh and tarty. The cream was not overly sweet, an overall lovely balance.

2nd --was the veggie quiche. This is nothing like the quiche you get at the supermarket refrigerated aisles. This quiche had fresh spinach, asparagus, tomato, and red onions. It was light, fresh tasting and evenly flavoured. (On that day they also had bacon quiche and salmon quiche-- my two friends got the other quiches and said they too were amazing). An order comes with a side mixed green salad and vinaigrette dressing.

3rd-- was the savoury crepe with ham and cheese. (I think it also comes with eggs, I opted out on that). The light sweet buttery flavour of the crepe was the perfect combination to the ham. I also ordered the butter squash ginger soup (I did not finish all because it was too much). This came with bread and what I think made the entire meal bomb, was the garlic olive butter for spreading on the bread. WOW!!! 

Because it is super new, the staff does not appear to have it all together as of yet.  BUT the food makes up for it. 

I cannot wait for my 4th.
