ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug Went in for breakfast the first morning we were at the Paris, and although there was a line to get a table, we were seated in respectable time.  That's about where the positives ended.
I ordered the fruit platter and bacon strips with a coffee.  Waiter never brought half&half even though I requested 3 times, each time he walked by to be exact.  Finally I had to ask a bus-boy for it, whom brought it promptly.  
The waiter had no idea what most of the items on the menu were.  My cousin asked about the beignets, he said he wasn't sure how they were. (no problem)  When it arrived, he brought out MUFFINS and when we questioned it, he said those were how they make beignets at this restaurant (apparently a French restaurant in a French themed hotel).  
After pointing out (via photos on our phones) that these are not beignets, he brings out a new dish, this time donut holes.  Cold ones, to be exact, with the center of the pastries still a bit uncooked.  No beignets, not once.  Coffee was cold, my bacon was cold.  Just all in all, food wasn't the best.  Maybe it was our selections by sour chance, because other Yelpers seem to like the other menu selections.
The icing on the donut hole came when we paid our bill with cash and the waiter questioned our tip to us.  Such lack of class, I would except better of a "sit down" "French" restaurant in a 4 star Vegas hotel, Center Strip.  Next time, use Yelp! and (if you drove your own car like we did) go eat off the strip, ESPECIALLY breakfast.  Or do a buffet.
