5Bp8rQlvD44_W2lkcCc2vw Our group of 6 adults and 2 kids went there on a Saturday morning for breakfast. Service was excellent and worthy of a Sofitel restaurant. We got pampered with white linen service, and the kids got to eat pretty much anything they wanted, even if it wasn't on the menu. Décor was modern and beautiful. Would surely have given this a five star rating, except it was pricey, so I equated that with the service, but took a point off for a lack of creativity on the menu. The eggs benedict I had was good but comparable to much cheaper places, the scrambled eggs my wife ordered was once again nothing exceptional. Safe to say its best to come here if you want to impress someone or have a quite conversation (our group was the loudest in the restaurant :) Would recommend this place on the mood of the day (do you want to feel like royalty for a couple hours or not? hehe), convenience i.e. staying at or near Sofitel like we were or just to say that you ate there :) Lunch and / or dinner may be quite different so cannot comment on that.
