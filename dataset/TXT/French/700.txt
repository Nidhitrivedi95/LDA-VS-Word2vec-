_cjPEH9wXhKS-HQe_U3M4Q why so many high ratings here? Ordered the onion soup, foie gras and steak, none of them meets the level of "tasty". In fact it is the worst foie gras I ever had. Onion soup tasted bitter and i dont know why. most of foods were left in the plate after the meal cuz i just cant enjoy them. Definitely never come again.
