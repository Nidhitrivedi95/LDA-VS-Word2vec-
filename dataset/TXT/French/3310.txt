1cGyzWtfOoDiE8V0OR85yA Great place for breakfast/lunch. The crepes are great and the coffee is what you expect at an independent coffee house (excellent)!

When in town I eat there at least once but, try to hit it twice. The atmosphere is great (good for all ages-- small children- business lunch- or to catch up with friends). 

Don't forget to take quarters for street parking. Pittsburgh has cash only parking meters. The meters on Craig St. have 1 hour max but, $0.25 does buy you half an hour.
