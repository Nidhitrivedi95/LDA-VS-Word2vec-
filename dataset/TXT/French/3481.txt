1j9BbuiaVYQWyXyUjb3rHg Went here for brunch. The food was overpriced and extremely mediocre - if you want to charge ~$15 for brunch, it has to be very good! My meal (mushrooms and egg on sourdough) looked like slop thrown together from cheap ingredients and was far from worth the price. The service was friendly at first - brought a colouring book and crayons for a friend's daughter which was wonderful - but after getting our food and half refilling our coffee (literally - ran out of coffee in the container she was pouring from and didn't bother coming back) we were ignored for the rest of our meal. We eventually had to go hunt down a staff member to get our cheque an hour later. Our server did apologize for having left us alone, claiming that it got too busy - but this wasn't the case until the last half hour of our stay. 

Also worth noting that the brunch menu was very pared down as compared to that advertised on the website. Many of the very attractive options were gone - there were really only run of the mill brunch staples that you could get better versions of elsewhere for less.

Some may appreciate their very family friendly policies, which was great.
