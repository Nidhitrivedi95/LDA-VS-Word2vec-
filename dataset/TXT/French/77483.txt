YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g Amazing. Simply amazing!!!! I went with a friend and her husband and we had an awesome meal. We started with a round of cocktails...had the Fleurtini with pomegranate juice and champage. Very yummy and fruity. The RSVP was at 8:30 but for some reason they didn't seat us until 9:15 but to make up for it, the chef made us an amuse bouche: deep-fried cod nugget over warm potato salad, and some kind of citrusy something....MMMM. They have a great bread selection...I could eat 4 or 5 of those pretzel rolls. Then for apps, we had the veal and Yukon potato ravioli, the beef tartare and the panko-coated egg with sweetbreads. For the entrees, I went with halibut and that fish was like BUTTER. the best fish I ever had. My friend and her husband ordered the rack of lamb and the filet mignon with foie gras on top and both were delicious as well. For dessert they had the chocolate souffle and I ordered the chocolate banana cake with the mini peanut butter shake (could've been colder) and a scoop of Bailey's ice cream. OH MY GOD. I'm getting teary-eyed just thinking about it. Best meal ever!! Totally going back someday!
