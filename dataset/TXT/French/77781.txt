YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g Here's the thing.  You're a "celebrity chef."  You're on TV and are brought in to judge cooking shows.  Maybe it's me but the food at your restaurant is YOUR FOOD.  Your name's on it.  Maybe you didn't cook it, but you sure as hell own it.  The food here is better than okay, to be sure, but maybe only as good as not bad.  Definitely not amazing, mind blowing or any of that good stuff.  We had the halibut, among other things that were much better, but that halibut was pretty bad.  That just shouldn't happen in a restaurant like this.  For the price and considering Keller's rep... it should just be better than it is.

LOVED the onion soup shots.  Those were definitely out of this world.
