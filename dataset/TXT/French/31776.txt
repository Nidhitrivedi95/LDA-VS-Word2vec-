grHISDkIGwttYthhW8DxCQ I just visited Montreal for a couple of nights and while I was there I wanted a real crepe since they just aren't as good in the US. On my last night in Montreal, I met up with a friend who has lived in Montreal his whole life and he recommended La Crepe 2 Go as his favorite crepe place. I am exceptionally glad that he did because La Crepe 2 Go did anything but disappoint. My boyfriend and I went there the following day, our last morning, for breakfast. For starters, La Crepe 2 Go is small, quaint, and a place mostly locals go to. I immediately loved it. We ordered two crepes. One was the traditional crepe with sugar and vanilla that we added bananas and strawberries to, and the other was a spinach, egg and cheese crepe. Both were phenomenal! We couldn't decide which we liked better. The strawberries and bananas were mounded atop the first crepe and the breakfast crepe was FULL of spinach, egg, and cheese and served with a little side of fruit! The owner was absolutely fantastic, and chatted with us about anything and everything while making our crepes. He checked with us a few minutes after we started eating to make sure we liked them. All of the ingredients are bought from a local market so everything is as fresh as it can get. The only thing ordered in bulk is the bananas because of the quantity they go through and the price point. Sure enough, while we were eating, a girl who works there came in to get her re-useable bags, and went to the market. Before we could finish our crepes, she was back with many bags that were FULL of fresh ingredients. I can't say anything better about La Crepe 2 Go!

The next time we go back to Montreal, we already decided that we are having every breakfast at La Crepe 2 Go!
