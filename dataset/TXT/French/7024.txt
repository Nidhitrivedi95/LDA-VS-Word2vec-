4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I really enjoyed the decor of this place and we got seated street side so it was a nice view... nice light on a nice Monday morning.  

The lunch was good but nothing spectacular.  However, can't go wrong with pate for lunch.  What made me really like this place is the look of it.  How much it made me feel like I was in some Paris cafe on a sunny day.  It just made me feel happy and relaxed.  

We were only there for lunch so the menu wasn't much to choose from.  Looking at their dinner menu though, I have a feeling I'd like that a whole lot better.  PROTEIN!
