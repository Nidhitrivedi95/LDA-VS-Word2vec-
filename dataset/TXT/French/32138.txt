gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA Absolutely crushing it in a beautiful space too. Impeccable service, and an outstanding experience all together. The cheese plate was perfect with the Pinot Noir selected.  The salmon entree was five stars (salmon prepared three ways,) and had an amazing soy sauce presentation to go with.  The Roasted chicken was moist, flavourful and went perfectly with the accompaniments. Yes, I used the chocolate dessert Yelp kicked us for checking in! five capital stars!
