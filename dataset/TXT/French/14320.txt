58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw My family and I went here for brunch based on the great reviews, and we weren't disappointed!

I got Le Sante as people seemed to be suggesting, and was quite pleased. The poached eggs were perfection. The mixed greens they lay atop were fresh and a nice addition to the meal. I asked for my pesto cheese on the side and didn't try it, so I can't speak for that, but I can only assume that it would have been phenomenal. The greek yogurt was topped generously with a sweet granola with fresh blueberries, served with honey on the side - it was the perfect mix of both tart and sweet! 

My other half got Le Nordique, which he thoroughly enjoyed...he was even kind enough to share some of it with me!

The parents both got the salmon bagel plate; they substituted a baguette for the bagel and loved every crunchy bite. Served open-faced with the cream cheese on the side, it was a lighter meal than the heavy brunch plates. 

The atmosphere was hip with long communal wooden tables, service was attentive but not overbearingly so. I'd definitely come back if I find myself in Montreal again.
