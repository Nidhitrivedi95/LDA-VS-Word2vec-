_cjPEH9wXhKS-HQe_U3M4Q Duck confit was on point and the "tendon de boeuf" - 72 hour slow cooked beef short rib was absolutely fall-off-the-bone delicious. We shared the pig ear salad. Very fresh. 

Mains were $25-$30 so reasonably priced. Ambience is classic French bistro. 

Will come back for sure
