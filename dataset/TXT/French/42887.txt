LnSjzFXh1GrOObsRP6LhBQ Used to go this chain often in Paris when my parents lived there. Anyway, I was excited to see Brioche Doree on King the other day; I had time to kill so I decided to drop in. It was quite busy with people stopping in to get a coffee for the go. Like the locations in France, they serve sandwiches, salads, treats and coffee based drinks. I'm not sure about WiFi, but there are heaps of outlets around the seating areas so this place would be good for getting work done. I had the Basque Cake and an Americano. Both of which were a-okay. 

Good for: coffee, tea, lunch
