kGOr_D-LNpgZ2M9N8TT4QQ Unreal dining experience here.  Fantastic service, great setting.. couldn't ask for more!  This place is straight out of Paris with the bench style seating and atmosphere.  We came for the Thursday champagne/oysters deal and my 2 guests and I were blown away.  Steak was amazing, frites were godly, and probably the best creme brulee in town.  Will return for sure to try the brunch or perhaps another bottle of Veuve on the patio in the summer!
