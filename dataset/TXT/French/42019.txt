Kut9tVbDX_f7qKMRRoXg3w Nice brunch spot in Old Montreal. Went here with a friend and we both ordered the Super Assiette which is really indeed super in terms of size and taste. We were both handed a plate with lots of fruit (cantaloupe/honeydew/pineapple/strawberries), generous amount of salad, deli meat, bacon, Alsacian style omelete, 3 small pieces of baguette, crazy good cheese (though I don't know what kind but man it was really good quality cheese), and of course I had my coffee. 

Now I recommend the super assiette if you're coming on a complete empty stomach and have not yet eaten a breakfast or anything at all. It is really filling but I took my time of course, talking a lot while throwing in bites here and there. The service was quite fast , and the waitress was very patient to have brought us 3 things that we wanted extra...like more baguette, more dressing and more coffee. I liked the decor of the place. Ambiance was warm and cozy. I also particulary liked the fact that it was not only a restaurant but a fromagerie and a boucherie. I was highly tempted to buy the same cheese that was served on my dish and bring it home....but alas I didn't.

If you're looking for something different for brunch and you are in the old port area, visit Marche de la Villette. They have so many different options to try like croque monsieurs etc.
