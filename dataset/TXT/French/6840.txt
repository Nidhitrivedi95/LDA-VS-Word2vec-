4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw We had reservations for 645PM and we were running late because of traffic on the strip and they still gave me my Opentable points... YAY!  I know a lot of restaurants who wouldn't do that.  My only complaint was that they seated us in the bar area of the restaurant which was really crowded with people around the bar, I would think they would sit us in the main room since we did have reservations.  The food was to die for.  The bread was super fresh from the oven... I wanted to eat more but did not want to ruin my appetite.  I ordered the Filet Mignon Au Poivre, medium rare... which was perfect and the creme fraiche made it all the better.  The meat was so tender and it melted in my mouth.  The pommes frittes were so good too.  Our server was really nice but a little creepy at the same time? haha, it's hard to explain.  All in all it was a great meal... my mouth is watering just thinking about the filet.
