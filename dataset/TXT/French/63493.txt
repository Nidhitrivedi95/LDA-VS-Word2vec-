t1mR_Zff6Dqv1TueE2JLEA What fun! Took my sister's bachelorette party here for dinner and the belly dancing was a total surprise for the bride! 

The environment was really beautiful and they were very diligent about getting everyone's order in before the dancing began, so you could just sit back and relax. We all ordered several options for the appetizers and were so happy with the multiple vegetarian selections that were provided. Yummy hummus, to boot! I wouldn't call the food earth-shattering, but it's filling and tasty. I had the lamb shank, and it was cooked very nicely, very tender. 

Around 9:30, the lights went low and the belly dancers put on an amazing show! It was astonishing to watch. They were wonderful at mixing and mingling too, so people in my party had fun learning some moves. 

Dinner and a show - a wonderful night!
