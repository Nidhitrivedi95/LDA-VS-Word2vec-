mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q I have been seeking out the perfect restaurant - I have now found it. 

Crispy langoustine, butter poached oysters, veal sweetbreads, foie gras torchon, red snapper ceviche. 

Typically I will say food, even at the best restaurants, needs a little x or a little less y - this was stunningly perfect. From the amuse to the final course to the service and ambiance. One Michelin star was easily deserved. 

Must try for anyone claiming to know food.
