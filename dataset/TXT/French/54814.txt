rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw This afternoon, a close friend and I enjoyed a lovely brunch. The food was great and the service was good. However, one employee went above and beyond the call of duty and I believe needs to be acknowledged. His name is Oscar. 

Shortly after receiving our meal, my friend wanted ketchup and orange juice. Our waitress was not around, so we asked another passing by. That waiter agreed to help, but never returned. Oscar passed by and was given the same request. Before he could return, our waitress showed up and we told her of the request believing that the others had relayed the information to her. Shortly there after, the waitress returned without the ketchup proclaiming that the restaurant was "out of orange juice" and that someone was sent downstairs to get more. However, less than 60 seconds later, Oscar arrived with both ketchup and a full glass of fresh OJ. Our waitress never returned to address this issue. 

While our waitress did a fine job, in general, it was Oscar who seemed to go above and beyond for a table that was not his responsibility. When leaving, we attempted to give him a separate tip, but he refused. He said that he loved his job and that sometimes it's just good to do the right thing. So, for that, Oscar is to be commended!  Great job and Thank you, Oscar!
