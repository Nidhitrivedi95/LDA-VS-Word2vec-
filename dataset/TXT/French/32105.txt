Their wine list is unlike anything I've ever seen or tasted. Dining at Andre's restaurants is always an unforgettable experience, but Alize is the jewel! Be ready for a unique experience from the time you arrive at the bar to the time you leave. We had great martinis at the bar served by Lisa. Alize's General Manager, Stavros, made sure that we were brought to our table exactly at the time of our reservation. The view of the strip from our table was stunning! Every detail in our dinning experience was handled with such precision. I started with the Foei Gras and the Phyllo Wrapped Pear Salad. The combination of taste and presentation left me aching for more. I chose the Dover Sole Amandine for my entree. The fish was absolutely delicious and moist. For dessert, I ordered the Grand Marnier souffle. This was the cherry on top. OMG... just delicious! 

Is it expensive - Yes! My sister and her two guests were so impressed. There is not enough money in this world to pay for the satisfaction of my lovely sister. Great Job Andre!
