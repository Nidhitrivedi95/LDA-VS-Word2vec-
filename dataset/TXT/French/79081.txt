ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug My husband and I had dinner here tonight.

We both ordered the 3 course menu $39 each

He got the wedge salad, mixed grill, steak, lamb chops and sausage with Yukon whipped potatoes, mac n cheese with cheese cake for desert he really enjoyed all parts of the meal, I even tired the blue cheese dressing (that i normally hate) and it was really good

I had the French onion soup, Filet mignon with the Yukon whipped potatoes, creamed spinach and chocolate cake , everything was great, I love french onion soup and try it every where I find it. My steak was perfect and both sides delish! The chocolate cake was rich and the mousse filling was awesome. 

We were seated right away, our server was attentive, drinks kept refilled and food served in a timely manner , starting with the wonderful french bread roll's baked together like a loaf of bread. I would definitely eat here again
