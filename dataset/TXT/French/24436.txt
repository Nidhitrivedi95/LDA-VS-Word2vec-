cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg We just dined here over the weekend. It was everything that people say. After seeing this recommended by the great Anthony Bourdain, it did not disappoint. If you like Foie Gras, this is the place. They had a menu of it with different combinations . In any form and we had about four different kinds to taste, all was delicious.  Either naked, baked, fried  or in a combination, all equally great. Every course had different forms of The Foie Gras and all was equally delicious.  We also had the Veal Carpaccio and it came with a duck egg to spread across the dish before eating. This was also amazing. Paired with great wine and really not too expensive  considering this is a Marc Piccard restaurant. Make certain you secure a reservation. Without one you will not get in.
