IZ0c8VGiDeURttERwuxuqg Sadly we made a reservation but never got a chance to experience the food. We made a reservation on open table, took a taxi a bit aways from our hotel only to be greeted by 1 waitress on the floor, holding it down, who told us they let in too many walk-ins and "chef" said no more people allowed. Clearly not prepared to do business. Appalled they allowed "too many walk-ins" mind you there were 3 tables sat with a whole restaurant empty, and would not allow their reservation in. Bad business bud.
