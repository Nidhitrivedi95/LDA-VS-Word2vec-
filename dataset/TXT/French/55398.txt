rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I love this!
My boyfriend and I came here for dinner.
We ordered steak which was incredibly delicious and meaty!
Everyone there looked really nice including the diners and the waiters. 
We had a great experience here. Loved the food, the atmosphere, and the service.
The oysters were amazing!!! I felt like swimming in the ocean while they were melting in my  mouth. YUM!!
Oh! also I had the bouchon martini and it tasted like straight vodka. If you can't take the alcohol, I recommend you don't order it. 
I was a little buzzed after the dinner. Loved it. 

Loved. It.
