Q8n1HaDyBKYUazQ108O5OA The Hotel Du Vin is located at the end of a beautiful tree lined col-de-sac in the West End of Glasgow near the University.  It's the best hotel in Glasgow.  It has charm and personality; great service; large comfortable rooms; delicious coffee and a wonderful in-house Bistro and Bar that is romantic; elegant and fun.  The food is delicious.  We both had the Dover sole with a side of wilted spinach, which was excellent.

Highly recommended.
