hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA These guys ROCK!!!

First, you gotta fin them and get to them. I think my co-worker was going kookoo when she was driving, which made it seem like a maze to get to them.

But once found, OMYUM!! I had the prosciutto sandwich and it was just SUPER yummy! I also took a bite of their chipotle chicken sandwich and that was YUMNESS too!  Each sammy came with a little side salad which made it a great lunch stop. They had these wedges of chocolate goodness sitting in the case that kept trying to get my attention. It was hard. Very hard. But I resisted the chocolate devil!!
