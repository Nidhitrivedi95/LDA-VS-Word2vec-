kcF-en40P3J9L8nLy5lKqQ I think this place is great for their happy hour plates and happy hour drinks. 
Oysters are really good I prefer East coast flavor even though their smaller. 
I also like how the pizzas are half price during happy hour. I recommend the vegetable board it's perfectly char grilled. 
I like ordering the well cocktails. 
I've tried an actual entree only once and it was tasty but the portion was way too small to share with someone else and I love sharing.
