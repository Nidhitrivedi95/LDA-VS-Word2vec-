rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A OMFG, hands down the BEST chicken and waffles, EVER. Now i know what you're thinking ... Chicken and Waffles at Bouchon? Trust me, just get it. Even if the chicken isn't fried, the damn thing was so juicy and the skin so crisp. Its served with a chive waffle (yes chive), and a vanilla butter, syrup, AND this BACON grease something something sauce. I think i should've just drank straight from the gravy boat how much was i was cover everything with it, and dipping my wife's fries in it.

The table also ordered the french toast(tasty), croque madame (tasty), and a special scallop dish (4-5 pieces) meant for the dinner service ($44), but served at a lunch time rate of i think $32. I didn't taste it, but it was gone faster than i could drink a cup of coffee, so it must have been good.

It was mother's day, and so they opened up the back private dining area to accommodate the extra guests, and we probably ended up waiting about 20 minutes to get seated. Our server was awesome, and knew what we were all about when we ran out of milk for our coffee and left the top off as if we were at a chinese place looking for more tea. Double thumbs up to him.
