sARavfidmIS878q5BtlyVQ I can't believe I didn't leave a review when I went here in 2014.  This was an amazing experience worth every penny.  I got extremely lucky with a last minute reservation for one and am glad I did.

This was the first time I ever had a "tasting menu" experience and ever since I have been seeking them out wherever I go.  And while I have found many gems none of them quite measure up to the style, flavors, and delight I was admitted to by this golden ticket.

The next time I go to DC I will be trying to get into Minibar for sure hoping to recreate this experience in a brand new way.
