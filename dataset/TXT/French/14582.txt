5EIuCcoHY2evAhFMBV6G6g One of the best value on the Strip.
I had the 5 course chef's tasting menu at $70. Which is probably at least $100 anywhere else on the strip.
The highlights of my tasting were the foie gras, the sashimi of kampachi on blood orange vinaigrette and the braised pork belly.
Great execution on all the dishes. The Patina Group from LA owns this place and they just have it down with clean, simple and bright flavors.
The service was great, too My wife had only 2 courses but our server made sure that each diner always has a dish in front them. Great job on pacing our meal.
This will be one my regular stops for a nice dinner in LV.
