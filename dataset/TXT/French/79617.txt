zqNgwQjj0_XAll-neGikIw Love this place! Had dinner tonight, I've never had the dinner, only breakfast until now. Our table got the mussels, beef special and salmon. Each was perfectly cooked and seasoned. We've had the award winning chocolate dessert so decided to try the strawberry cheesecake dessert, with a mix that also contained, as my wife said "the best white chocolate she's had." Great night, the chef is really nice and loves talking about food, cooking, and things on general. We loved scratch, we're excited Merci is open now and can't wait to go again for breakfast.
