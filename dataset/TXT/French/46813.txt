nkHaix6KenApS8M-liZsCQ Sat at the bar where they cook the food and that is the best seat in the house.  They have a pretty good happy hour, all of the food and certain glasses of wine are 50% off - good deal.

Food:

The happy hour menu is more limited but a good deal for the value.  Had the wild mushroom, fontina and argula pizza.  The crust was fantastic, the toppings were a bit bland and needed a little salt.  Also, shared the cheese plate with crostinis  - good, as expected.  The wine we had was fantastic.  They have a good wine list.  They were making homemade ricotta when we were there, which was cool.  

Our server was fantastic.

Atmosphere - good

As a foodie, the only thing that would have made it better is the cook being more willing to talk.  I asked her several questions about what she was making (when she wasn't busy) and she gave short answers and it was clear she didn't want to talk.  

I tried this place because the chef won the James Beard Award so my expectations were extremely high.  It was good but it didn't quite meet my expectations of five stars!

I would however go there again as the menu looked fabulous!
