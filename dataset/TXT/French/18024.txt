A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g I live in California and always looking forward to buy the french macaroon at this location.  Actually bought 50pcs today. Requested the male cashier to give me 3 smallboxes.  To my dismay, a female cashier answered back saying that she's running low on boxes.  I told her i'm willing to pay.  She answered in a very impolite manner saying that, "didn't you hear, that's all the boxes i have".  The male cashier pointed to the unmade boxes on the shelf, and the female cashier with an attitude tell him ok.

WTH!  You will really loose a faithful customer over a $1 worth of box!  I'm not even asking for a free box!  I was gonna pay for it!  

This female cashier needs to goto customer service 101!  I deserve a full refund on this purchase because of this poor customer service!
