rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I ate at plenty of restaurants in vegas, but this by far is my favorite place to dine.  And yes, it's worth the 20+ min wait time......waiting was not bad though because we had bloody mary's to keep us entertained.  OMG, they have THE BEST bloody mary's --- i had to order 3 (yes, 3 at 10 am... ahem, only in vegas?).  The service was great... i kind of forgot what i ordered but remember it was tasty.  :) (just kidding).  I ordered the hash brown and potatoes -- it was really good and fresh! would def order it again.  oh and their bread was amazingly fresh ---- mmmmmmm.  I want to go back to vegas just to eat here (again!).
