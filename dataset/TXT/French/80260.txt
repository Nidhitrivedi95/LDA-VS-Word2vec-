zw4Legbcu018p5WcZ74iWA Fantastic poutine! Ordered poutine, a pitcher of beer, and veggie burger. The veggie burger was so good I had to get a second. Overall, the prices are okay, but the portions are small and there aren't a whole lot of seats available, so I wouldn't recommend this for large groups unless you're doing takeaway.
