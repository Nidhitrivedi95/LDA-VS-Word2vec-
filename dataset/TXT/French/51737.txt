PlYrlj86zAYljZTRCBSZ3A Wow. The poutine here was everything you want poutine to be ... the portions are generous and very sharable, the food was fresh and delicious, and the services was friendly and fast. There is no seating, except for a couple of picnic tables out front, so you'll either have to grab-and-go or maybe make some new friends. Regardless, highly, highly recommend!!

BTW - no more crepes.
