hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA Baguette Cafe is a lovely place to frequent.  I am pleased to have found a great French cafe in Vegas-definitely reminds me of Europe.  The food and coffee do not disappoint, and the owners are charming and friendly.  Do check this cafe out.  I highly recommend it.  And Olivier is awesome!
