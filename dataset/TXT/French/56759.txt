rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Pros:
- Warm pistachios when you sit down
- Fresh french fries (yes, one of my 4 food groups)
- Steak anything. We had the skirt steak and it was incredible. Our neighboring table was exclaiming about theirs.
- Sexy cocktails 
- Fabulous ambiance 

Cons:
- My trout had too much lemon and I was too drunk to have the presence of mind to send it back. Boo.

The verdict:
How do you say bon appetit in French? Oh.
