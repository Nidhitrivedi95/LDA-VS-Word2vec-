hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA I will give it a 4.5 stars. We came in on Monday right at lunch time expecting it to be crazy, but it wasn't so we were able to order and grab a seat out on the patio. 

Olivier was ringing people up and he was super friendly. The cafe itself is small, cute, and clean. I loved the patio seating. Even though it's located in a business center, you don't really feel like it at all. 

I ordered the Blue Brie and leek-potato soup. My bf ordered he Moroccan and a smoothie. Everything was delicious! I LOVE the bread the sandwiches come on. I guess they make it fresh daily. It has a nice crisp on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside. It's just perfect for sandwiches. Both sandwiches were great but I preferred the blue brie. I really want to try the Chipotle the next time I go. 

The food is all very flavorful and tastes fresh. It's a great little spot and can't wait to go back.
