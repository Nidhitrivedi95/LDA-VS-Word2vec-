4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I have been meaning to write a review about this restaurant for quite some time now! This place is my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE brunch place in Las Vegas!!! If your in Vegas for the weekend you NEED to come here for brunch and sit on the patio. Sitting on the patio makes the whole experience. This restaurant is at the Paris Hotel and you can watch the Bellagio water show as you sit in the sun on the patio talking to friends. AMAZING! Have to always come here when I'm in Vegas.
