q0n4I-zqiI47xispOqc1lA My group and I always are looking for a new brunch spot to love. So we looked online for brunch spots ( we LOVE Coca Cafe, Gypsy Cafe, Square Cafe ) and found this GEM. It may very well be our new favorite brunch spot. Or one of them. It's SPECTACULAR!

My we shared so much stuff around the table it was unreal. The crepes were so yummy. I had the Elvis minus the bacon, bananas and peanut butter drizzled with maple syrup. So yummy, so good. Then my main course was the potato scramble. It wasn't a scramble in any way shape or form, it was an omelet. But it was one hell of an omelet. Cheese, tomatoes, and hash browns inside the omelet. So fluffy and so awesome. My good friend ordered the espresso french toast and said it was the best french toast she ever had. Drenched in a chocolatey gooey goodness. And had the perfect amount of coffee flavor to it. And the bread inspite of the glaze was still perfectly browned in butter. 

My wife went with a savory french toast, one with pepperoni, tomato, olives. Not my scene, but she loved it so that's all that matters. She said she thought it was great. 

My ONLY complaint was home fries. They weren't that great, oven browned I think then wayyy too much paprika. Most places trash home fries so no big deal. But the amount of paprika was WOW!! But no big deal. 

Oh and I went and had the gingebread latte. Couldn't wait til' September, so I went ahead and had one. MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM. Exceptional latte. Great. 

Please go. If you love brunch, you will not be disappointed.
