4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw We are members of the Lettuce Entertain You rewards club, so we come here at least 4 times a year, even though it is a half hour drive from our house. The filet with merlot butter/ red wine reduction sauce is my favorite item on the menu. Each steak come with the most delicious tiny little French fries (frites) and you will eat every last bite of them. The last two times we were there (my birthday and valentines day) we had the same server, Demetri, and he clearly loves his job! We never feel like we are a burden on the wait staff, they enjoy working at their restaurant just as much as we do dining there. My one and only complaint is that the valet at Paris is usually full and if you have to park in the garage you need to give yourself 10 extra minutes to get to your reservation on time. I guess that's called a "first world problem". Oh well.
