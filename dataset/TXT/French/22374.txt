We found the place on Yelp and were drawn by the promise of $12 bottomless mimosas (1 cent per refill) and a carefully-curated menu with healthy options. Each time we've gone (twice alone, once with friends), our mimosas were never less than half-full, and mostly champagne. The food is consistently outstanding, though my boyfriend didn't enjoy the peanut-butter themed item he had one time-- too rich. I adore the omelets, potatoes, and sausages. The enchilada stack was great, though a lot to handle!

Another thing that stands out is the service. The hostesses are always friendly, welcoming, and seat us promptly. There's never a wait. Our servers are wonderful too, checking up on us just enough. They never cut into conversation but always seem to appear at the most convenient time.

I love the atmosphere; always a comfortable temperature, classy interior, and spotlessly clean. Tables are bussed immediately after guests leave the restaurant. The bar looks fun for a game day, though we've never sat there. Even with the TVs on, the acoustics in the room must be good, because it's never noisy. There's a gentle hum of conversation, but that's it.

Prices are absolutely reasonable.

Local Bistro, keep up the great work! We love you and we will be back whenever we want brunch.
