SBnpT6JDbah-5l_52GM5sw This has to be the best restaurant in Madison!  A very relaxed open atmosphere in the Machinery Row loft.  I love the look of the space - exposed beams and ductwork, gorgeous tile and pewter bar.  I also really like the flip out windows at the kitchen - you can look in and see what is going on.

The food is out of this world - french bistro.  Don't miss the warm duck confit salad, skate wing, and steak w/ frites.  All are delicious.  I have not had a bad dish there yet.  The prices are very reasonable for someone used to Chicago restaurant pricing. 

Newly opened, the place is very popular.  In fact, at one visit we had a 5pm reservation (due to an event that evening) and at 4:45, there were about 10 people waiting to get in!

If you like Sardine, you should also check out their breakfast & lunch place, Marigold Kitchen, which is right off the square.
