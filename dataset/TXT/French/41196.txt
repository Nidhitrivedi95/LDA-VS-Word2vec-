kGOr_D-LNpgZ2M9N8TT4QQ I went for a summerlicious dinner with 4 colleagues on a Wednesday night.  We were thoroughly dissapointed with the quality of the steaks. Out of the 4 steaks, none were cooked to the requested degree. The fries and crème brûlé were decent. The oysters were fairly good. Service seemed rushed and impersonal at first, but improved  throughout our stay - they consistently confused our orders though. On the plus side, they did provide my colleague with a complementary drink because her original one was not good. The ambience and decor were quite sophisticated. Due to the quality of the food in relation to the price however, I cannot recommend this restaurant to anyone.
