xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g The first time here was when my family and I moved to Vegas, so it's been awhile and thought we should try this place again, so we decided to come here for New Year's Day dinner. I have a big family, which is great because it means there are more dishes I could try! I feel that this is a great restaurant for people who are visiting Vegas, because the restaurant offers a great view of the strip, as well as, the Bellagio fountain show. But if you are looking for an omg, mouth watery dishes then it's best to try other restaurants from renowned chef around the city.
I am very pleased that the seafood platter was cook perfectly.  My duck was a bit bland to me. My brothers got steak (ribeye & filet mignon) and it was ok.
My dinning experience was not as great coming from a high-end restaurant. Our server seemed very quick and efficient, which is good for attending to all the customers and getting everyone served. But I like it more when they take their time with you and agreeing with what you order. I felt that she was pushy to get my dad to get a side dish even though it was obvious that he didn't want any. Then when my mom was next to order and she asked my dad if he got any side dishes, the waitress gave an attitude, "I already asked him, but he didn't want any." When we were undecided on whether we should get one or two seafood platter, she announced over the entire table to get everyone's attention to hurriedly decide what we want. 
Lastly, we opt to skip the dessert and just asked for the check and she gave a disapproving look. The restaurant was bit pricey for the food and service, but I guess you're paying for the spectacular view.
