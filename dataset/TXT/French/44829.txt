mr4FiPaXTWlJ3qGzp4-7Yg Brunchy time and we have a winner.  To start, we got a seat right away on Sunday for brunch.  I highly suggest going around 11:30 as you just miss the 12pm rush.  It is a stylish restaurant and the service was top notch.

For my meal, I had the french toast.  It was good - light and perfectly cooked.  The cinnamon anglaise tasted like melted ice cream.  There was an assortment of berries as well.  Their orange juice was freshly squeezed and we were in and out in under 45 minutes. 

Definitely will be back for another brunch extrodinaire!
