ZrHU8ZzwZQjTRpB1K_8JTQ I too am hoping that this unique and beautiful restaurant works out the kinks and begins to perform up to the high expectations.  My wife and I experienced the same problems during week #1 that the other reviewers have described (e.g. the relatively expensive burger and not-so-good white fish). We loved the atmosphere, albeit a bit too noisy, but the food and the service didn't measure up to the competition that day.  I suggest the chef and servers visit Brasserie V to experience another way of doing things! Their best burger is actually worth $12!  

We are looking forward to our next meal at the Stamm House and are sure we will experience a marked improvement in all aspects of the dining experience!
