P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ I visited the restaurant during a trip to Vegas. The sea bass was great. The water serviced us well. The worst part was the valet parking at Caesar Palace. I was supposed to be able to park at the valet at the entrance at Flamingo road which is right down the restaurant as a guest of Guy Savoy. But the valet attendant insisted I can not do the valet there and asked me to move. My wife had to talk to the supervisor and explained to him that my mom won't be able to walk that far. Later we found out the valet parking was reserved for the guests at Guy Savoy from the manager. The most amazing thing is the valet attendant asked us to pick up our car down the street after we finished the dinner and ready to leave. I asked where is my car. He said "I don't know, just down the street. Do you want to pick up yourself." This is the most amazing valet parking experience I have ever had.
