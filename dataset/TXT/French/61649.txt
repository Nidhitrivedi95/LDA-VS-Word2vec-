SLD5QYRCOgP2UDscLyrcaw Frankly, for the prices, I was completely underwhelmed. An empty restaurant on West Queen West should have been our first clue, especially when Ali the others are practically full.

The only stars are for the polite service and quaint back yard patio, the duck confite was dry and boring, and the French onion soup which admittedly was the only good part of the meal was really not much better than I could have made at home.

I've never written a review, so the fact that the combination of high prices and poor quality was enough to get me to write this should say enough. Either the quality needs to go up or the prices need to come down.
