_cjPEH9wXhKS-HQe_U3M4Q Superb service from the sommelier and our charismatic server Kathleen.  She was such a sweety that when my phone died, she took a pic of our lovely dessert and emailed it to me and went to charge my phone.  I guess you get what you pay for and I could get used to this type of treatment!  Parsnip soup of the day was flavourful light and fresh,  not too salty,  and paired deliciously with the recommended "Kir Royal" champagne cocktail. They brought me and my date complimentary fresh bread which made the soup all that much better. 

Then,  I decided to have the foie gras since I had loved it so much at the St. James hotel in Montreal but la select's version was much more a pate and I didn't enjoy it as much but it was well plated with a side of a blueberry type jam and crackers. This alone would not have satisfied me so it's a good thing I had the soup and bread. The sommelier recommended the "Gewürztraminer" for the foie gras and it was perfect for my sweet tooth.  My date enjoyed his glass of Niagara Riesling with the Sunday special - short rib and risotto.  The meat was very tender and juicy with a nice jus on top but the risotto was not my favourite.... Bit too al dente for me. 

I had been anticipating dessert and it was well worth the wait (as you can see in the photo!).  I almost chose my safe go-to -  the creme brulee -  but Kathleen made it impossible scooters  resist the lemon tart pie. We added the three flavours of sorbet to soothe our stomachs and I warmed up with a grand marnier blueberry tea. 

Needless to say,  I was on cloud nine tonight at select!  Loved the atmosphere as well and the special Canadian maple bourbon shooters Kathleen created for us was a real treat.  Thank you for the wonderful service experience and I shall be back to try the beef bourgignonne or le lapin.
