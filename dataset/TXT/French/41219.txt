kGOr_D-LNpgZ2M9N8TT4QQ Thursdays, Melpeques for a dollar and beer!  Give me $100 worth.  Nice crowd too.

Big patio outside, inside has some ambiance and the crowd is bustling and alive.  Great location

I will have to try the food sometime, but don't know if I will since it's more of an oyster bar.  They also seem to server market fresh seafood judging by the ice display setup.

The service is overall OK.  Our waitress seemed a little disinterested.
