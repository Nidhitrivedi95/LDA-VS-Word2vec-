XcWlBj5oQgzKhR7Cxovj3w I had the Alsatian tart appetizer (a whopping $15) and my partner had the dinner omelette. His omelette was good, very cheesy; however, the tart was only partially warmed, and the server didn't know if it was supposed to be a hot or cold dish. The service was decent but it's expensive for small quantities of food.
