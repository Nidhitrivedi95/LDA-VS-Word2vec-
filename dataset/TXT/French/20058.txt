aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw I've only had the macarons here.  I stopped by after breakfast (this place is sort of hard to find, it's underneath escalators) at Bouchon to pick up some macarons for my sister before driving home.

I would have gotten more, but they had ran out of a lot of stuff!  They even only had one chocolate macaron left, so getting there earlier is a must.  Regardless, the macarons seem pricey, but they're about as big as my palm, so it's well worth it.  They have pretty tasty macarons, but I wouldn't go as far as to say they're the best you can find -- maybe for Vegas though.

I was considering giving this place four stars, but I couldn't really justify it.  But I still feel like five is a lot, so for accuracy, I'll say it's four-and-a-half stars.
