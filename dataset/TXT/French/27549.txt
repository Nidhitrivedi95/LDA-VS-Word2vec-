They also have a location on 7th street which is more small and condensed. The menu consists of traditional dishes like spring rolls, crispy rolls (egg rolls) as some people may know them as, traditional and also modernized with a twist! Rice paper also has pho, 2 sizes depending on your appetite! Vegetarians and some vegan options are also a choice here! Menu is simple, they also have a great HH reverse HH, and awesome drink menu! I stopped by, went into the hotel entrance got greeted right away, I also got attended with a drink which I chose the green tea which is delightful! Free refills for anybody wondering if they do that! They also have a good delicious traditional Vietnamese iced coffee which is very heavenly I might add! I had many suggestions to get the firecracker shrimp, which is a starter didn't know it was huge pieces of shrimp so delicious I combined it with the garlic noodles, I recommend it on the same plate which they'll be happy to do! I wanted to order more but once I started eating my plate I was so full! Such a good meal! Definitely coming back for more! Also want to thank James my server for a wonderful experience!
