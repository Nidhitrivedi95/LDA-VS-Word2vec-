ynwARDp7X2fi6hk9XCOSNQ I'm somewhat baffled, because I honestly have no idea which restaurant some of these reviewers could possibly be referring to: Nachos?  Quesadillas?  There was nothing even remotely like that on the menu when we dined there this past month, and based on the lived-in, traditional decor, not to mention the years-old citations and magazine reviews framed on the walls, I can't imagine how the restaurant could have possibly changed formats 180 degrees in recent months.  The Chez Queux where we dined featured traditional French/Canadian food, prepared in a traditional French/Canadian style; the food was delicious, tastefully presented and served by gracious staff in a traditional and cozy setting.  We were fortunate to have found the place, and look forward to returning there on our next trip.
