rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A The food here is not good compared to the hype it receives.  It's mediocre.

We ordered 5 dishes (main dishes).   

- White Sausage: W.T.F. $28 bucks for one piece of sausage and some mashed potatoes and puree?
- Rib Eye, medium rare.  $58? for a mediocre piece of steak. Not tender. Not juicy. They give you a bunch of fries like we're kids.  Alright, this place is not a steak house, but seriously, it's just a normal piece of meat.
- Chicken - was okay.  Meat is cooked perfectly and sauce is good. But the waiter told me it's the "signature dish" of the restaurant.  I took a bite (along with the bacon, sauce), and it's good. But nothing impressive.  It shouldn't be the signature dish.  Signature dishes make you want to come back.  This was good, but I wouldn't come back.
- Salmon - nothing impressive.  It's very very mediocre.
- Croque Madame - absolute junk.  Search "How to make Croque Madame" on youtube and you can make it better yourself. Croque Madame = grilled cheese plus a fried egg. Yea, it's not fancy, but for Thomas Keller, we expect it to be ELEVATED.   

This is supposed to be one of the best restaurants in Vegas.  I expected ELEVATED food, not simple food you can cook at home watching youtube videos.

These dishes would not pass the first episode of MasterChef.

If this wasn't hyped so high, I would give it 3 stars.  But because they couldn't live up to the hype, I give it 1.5.

PS - Service.  WHAT THE FLYING F****.  The waitress didn't check on us once.   The food took 1 hour (literally) to arrive.

Go to Mon Ami Gabi and order their steak.  Thank me later.
