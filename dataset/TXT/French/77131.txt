YUFxSG6idHePsxOmnSHtpQ Love the French Onion soup and carrot raisin muffins here.
Today we came after three and you could say the entire staff was out to lunch.
We eventually seated ourselves at the bar, got our own menus too, was eventually greeted by someone who offered to get us drinks but again we were waiting for a server.
Did finally get service and our order placed and meal delivered in a timely manner.
I had quiche with soup and a muffin and my son had the soup and sandwich.  
Meal was fine as we had anticipated.
Bummed they don't have a muffin included in the soup & salad option.
