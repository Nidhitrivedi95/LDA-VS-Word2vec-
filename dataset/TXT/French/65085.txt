Tl2nqtPXlLbAG3qkUYVM2g We decided on a whim to stop in on our way home from the airport this morning. Vincent Bistro is open from 7am to 2pm on the weekends and for dinner too on weekdays.
We walked in around 945am and it seemed that they were closed as there weren't any cars in their lot. We figured it was because of the long weekend many folks are away on holiday.
We were greeted by a very friendly and wonderfully accented Mauritian server, who was naturally happy to have someone come in on this slow morning for them.
We were treated to some wonderfully fresh mini croissants with fruit compote. Warm, flaky and delicious! Best of all they were free!
The bistro menu has lots to choose from with something for everyone. 
My wife had the Niçoise salad that was beautifully presented and very tasty. I had a ham and gruyere omelette that was made wit succulent roasted off the bone ham.
We were also treated to mini strawberry cheesecake with ice cream and berry drizzle as a dessert, also on the house! A very nice touch and had us already planning our return visit.
It's a bit odd that guests have to go outside and around into the main restaurant to use the restroom, but it did afford a look around the castle cellar like environs of the main space which looked very rustic and cozy. I look forward to having cocktails in the bar there. 
I highly reccomend the bistro breakfast, and they do what seems to be great $25 prix fixe 3 course dinners in there as well. Tres bien fait Vincent! Merci!!
