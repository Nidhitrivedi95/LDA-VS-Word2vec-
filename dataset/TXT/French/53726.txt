We ordered the caesar salad, the famous $32 burger the poussin but i forgot the desserts.  The salads good but were nothing special.  The poussin was very juicy and full of flavor.  It was a good sized portion and was a very satisfying dish.  The burger was good.  Fois gras, truffle, pulled shortribs in a burger?  It was good but I don't think it was worth $32.  It's one of those things that you'd order just to try but probably wouldn't order it again. 

Overall, we had a pretty good experience at Daniel Boulud.  The food was above average and the price for a Michelin restaurant was well within reason.
