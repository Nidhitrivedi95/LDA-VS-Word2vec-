bRmb81XDG3E2SOHARBLTog Bodega has a nice romantic, french-inspired atmosphere that is nice for a quiet meal.  The prix-fixe menu, so very french, is a good option.  The portion sizes are well balanced for a nice three course meal.  All around, the restaurant is solid across each dimension: food, service, ambiance, however it doesn't spike to great in any one area.

The driver behind the three star review is the food:  We had the goat cheese and onion torte and the crab cakes as starters.  The crab cakes were heavily fried and were not as flaky as I would like.  For mains, I had the cassoulet with duck confit which was very nice (although I didn't expect a duck leg as the confit).  My husband had the steak frites which was good but nothing spectacular.  For dessert, I had the creme brule but the sugar coating on the top was slightly burned.  The dish had just been taken out of the refrigerator as the bottom of the custard was still cold - this also makes it challenging to properly melt the sugar on top.
