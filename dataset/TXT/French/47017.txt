nWW6fBfBljiRFa4sG7TyxA I had lunch with a friend here on a Saturday. Great happy hour prices, but even better food. We ended up just splitting three appetizers thinking we would move onto another place for more food, and I totally regret that choice. We shared the gravy frites, pork belly, and the duck confit. All three were fantastic, as were the sidecar cocktails made from the excellent bartender. I will certainly be back to have an entree, and try the charcuterie.
