4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw My fiancé and I planned a small wedding in Vegas and needed a good, yet affordable, restaurant for our reception dinner.  Since we were staying at the Paris and I had eaten there before and knew it was good, we decided on Mon Ami Gabi.  

I got in touch with the event coordinator, Drew, who sent me information via email including prices for a private party room with a view of the Bellagio fountains.  Although that sounded lovely, we were not having too many guests and opted for a table in the main dining room.  Therefore, no deposit was needed.  All we had to do was make the reservation and confirm the number of guests 24 hours prior to the dinner.  I also asked if we could drop off favors beforehand to have set up at each place setting, which they were happy to accommodate.

The dinner went very smoothly and was a big success.  We arrived on time and our table for 17 was ready with the favors.  Drink and appetizer orders were taken and delivered quickly and everything was delicious!  They also brought out bread and rolls.  Just about everyone ordered some kind of steak and once again, everything was brought our swiftly.  Our meals were perfect!  Everyone was raving!  Dessert was also amazing; bread pudding, crème brulee, some kind of chocolate yumminess, etc.

Something needs to be said about the atmosphere, too; lots of dark wood, wine bottles lining the wall and large windows facing the fountains.  The lighting was dim and elegant.  It's the type of place at which I would expect to pay a lot more.

And speaking of...the bill, including gratuity, came out to less than half of what we had budgeted for!  Great deal!

Overall, we were very pleased with the planning, service, and quality of the food.  I look forward to dining there again when I'm back in Vegas!
