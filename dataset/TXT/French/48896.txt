oJZNHz5UUVUgrZwVBVlpYw If you are looking for a well made drink, friendly bar tenders, live piano music, an elegant ambiance with great people watching and luxe appetizers available, then this is your place. If you sit at the bar, Pedro, Michael & Aaron will entertain you with great conversation & make you a great crafted original recipe drink. Complimentary snacks are served in a trio silver platter dish that consists of smoked almonds, gourmet popcorn and sesame sticks. If you are craving more than elevated bar snacks, they do offer fresh seafood appetizers among other choices. 

This bar is open 24 hours and serves elegant high noon tea with all the trimmings durning the day. This bar is also a great place to "people watch" as it is located right next to the main entrance of the Bellagio casino and hotel front desk lobby. 

The bar is under the management of Mr. Radek Lhotsky who knows how to run a great establishment to the high expectations one would want from a resort like Bellagio. I highly recommend this bar & it is definitely an excellent place for a before or after dinner cocktail.
