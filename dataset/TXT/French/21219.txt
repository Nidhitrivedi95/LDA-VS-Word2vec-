B56AYe5GNuavMDtwFsXqzA After reading many reviews on Yelp, my wife and I figured we'd make this one of our dinner stops while in Scottsdale.  We are very happy that we did.  Our experience was one of the best we've had in the last few years and we've eaten at some really nice restaurants.  Our server was Chad who also happened to be their authority on wine and mixed drinks.  He recommended a lovely Pinot Blanc for my dinner and made a custom martini for my wife who wanted something light and citrus-y. Both were great.

The menu is fairly limited but filled with French classics and everything was spot on.  For appetizers I had the escargots en croute and she had the foie gras.  I'd say the foie gras was the better but I thoroughly enjoyed my escargot.  For the main entree my wife had the veal cheeks which was incredibly tender and flavorful.  I chose the pouet roti which was very tasty with a crispy seasoned skin and juicy interior.  For dessert, I chose the vanilla souffle and my wife chose the chocolate creme brulee.  I've never had a better souffle and the grand marnier sauce was such a wonderful addition.  The creme brulee was done perfectly and very good.  I think the souffle was better but there were no regrets on any of our choices.  I also had an apple brandy to go along with my souffle and though I'm no expert on brandies, it seemed just right with my dessert.

Chad's service was flawless and we happened to have the outside side dining area all to ourselves until around 9pm.  I guess that's the benefit of eating outside in late June.  

We were so thrilled with our meal that next time we're in Scottsdale we're going to come back.  It was so hard to choose off the menu as I wanted to try many of the other options.  Next time.
