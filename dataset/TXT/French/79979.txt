It's a perfect romantic date night venue, however, I treated a friend to birthday lunch here and we enjoyed their excellent service and charm in the day time instead.

We ordered from the $23 Summerlicious menu. I had the ceviche, skirt steak, and isle fondant with anglais (meringue and cream anglaise). My friend had duck rilette salad, rainbow trout and cream brûlée.

Everything was delicious but we decided we liked the ceviche over the duck rilette and the rainbow trout over the skirt steak. The brûlée was definitely better than the meringue, but the meringue was pretty good too.

Everything was presented beautifully. Only we are greedy little piggies and took no photos. Hehehe. Would definitely come back!
