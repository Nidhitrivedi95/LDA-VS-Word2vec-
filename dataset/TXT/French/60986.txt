SFnrHuVFSNiondFVUBLJZQ Solid dessert location for savory and sweet crepes.  Really enjoyed their chocolate fondue as well and the generous amount of fresh fruit and such they give to dip into the chocolate.  Gets really packed and then empty fairly quickly and because they have 3 floors of seating it's virtually no wait to get in and get out.
