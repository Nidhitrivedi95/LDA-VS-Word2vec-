QlSpPzc4Oy05ic-PsoYH4g I live up the street and was so excited to hear about a new restaurant opening. Streets on Carson blew away all of my expectations. The service was great and our waiter Nicholas was incredibly knowledgable about the entire menu. The food was incredible and I savored every bite. The restaurant concept is street food across the country which is so unique to Pittsburgh. This is a Southside must.
