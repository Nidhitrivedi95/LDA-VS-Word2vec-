Tl2nqtPXlLbAG3qkUYVM2g My wife and I went to celebrate my birthday.  We were assured on the phone twice, and also by our waiters that the meals could be prepared gluten free, as my wife has celiac disease, this is important.  We ordered the sea scallop appetizer, spinach and bacon salad and the arugula salad, I had the NY Strip and she had the rack of lamb.  Dessert was good, we got some kind of creme brulee assortment and I got the Grand Marnier souffle. The food was cooked perfectly and delicious, but we didn't make it to the car before she got sick.  

In a nutshell, a $180.00 bill plus tip- and she'll be in bed curled up in the fetal position until tomorrow afternoon. -"glutened".  

Thanks guys.
