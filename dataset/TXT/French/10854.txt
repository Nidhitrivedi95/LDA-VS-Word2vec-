4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I brought my family, mom, brother, daughters, son and son in law here to celebrate my 50th birthday!  I requested patio seating so we could enjoy the strip as we ate, but I didn't take into consideration the Vegas heat and was just getting ready to request an indoor table when our waiter showed up!  I believe his name was Billy, he was PERF!!  His attentiveness, humor, advice, and personality made us forget about the heat and just enjoy the moment!  

I had the Filet Mignon Au Poivre medium and it was PERFECT!  It cut with just my fork and felt like butter melting in my mouth! The creme fraiche was delicious!  

My daughter and son ordered the Hanger Steak in merlot butter and it had a nice toasty exterior and tender interior and the sauce added a delicious touch.  

My brother and son in law ordered the Bone-In Ribeye, it was huge!  They could not finish it all!  

We also had the Wild Escargots de Bourgogne and LOVED them!  The garlic butter was PERFECT for dipping our baguette!

All in all, a very good experience!  I would definitely come again!!
