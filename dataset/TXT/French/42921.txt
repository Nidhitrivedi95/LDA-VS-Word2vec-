This little gem of a cafe is on the site of many previous ventures in the food line! It is only open at lunchtime.
Its decor is fresh clean and airy!
There is a tiny kitchen and it is constantly busy!
We opted for Croque Madame and Fish Cakes from the normal menu but there is a board with specials and a 2 or 3 course meal deal
The food was tasty and the portions were generous.
There is a great choice of desserts and all cakes are home made. Licenced to sell alcohol.
Service was with a smile!
