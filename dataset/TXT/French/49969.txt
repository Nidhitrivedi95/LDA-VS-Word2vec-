They have a lot of different breads, pastries, desserts, & even a couple subs/sandwiches. Every time we go there we usually get the desserts to take them home to enjoy at a later time. While everything tastes amazing, it can err on the expensive side. 

The staff is always friendly and doing their best to keep the line moving and get everyone their treats. 

Stop in and grab some delectables after a nice stroll through town or after a good day at the pinball arcade down the street!
