xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g Very much looking forward to going to Vegas this weekend and this restaurant is the reason! I've been to Vegas dozens of times being so close by in Los Angeles and every time I've taken friends or family here they rave about it for weeks. Thinking of making a reservation for Friday night for my best friend's birthday and hope she has the same experience I've grown to know and love. Desserts are to die for!
