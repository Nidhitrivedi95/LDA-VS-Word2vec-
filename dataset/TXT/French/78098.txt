YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g My husband and I were excited to see a Hubert Keller restaurant located in Mandalay Bay, since we were staying for his conference.  We stopped in for lunch on Sunday, October 23.  I ordered the capellini with garlic butter, tomato, olive, fine herbs and my husband ordered an asian-style noodle dish, which was the special that day.

What a huge disappointment!  My capellini was overcooked to the point of being mushy, and was way under-seasoned.  Simply tasted like buttered pasta.  My husband's entree was forgettable, bland and the quality of a frozen entree.

What's wrong with this picture??  World renowned chef with food quality on par with a chain buffet.  Ouch.  

Oh, and one last comment - worst Bloody Mary ever, and I have had numerous through the years.

Sorry Mr. Keller, I don't usually post negative reviews, but, considering the high quality food we experienced at other restaurants in Vegas, I thought you should know . . .
