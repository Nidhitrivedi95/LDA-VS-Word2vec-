FJMMPL3pxAPYGEPB0Hwlhw Toca...Toca...Brunch at the Ritz-Carlton's beautifully-appointed restaurant makes getting up early on Sunday morning a lot easier. We begin our gastronomic road trip with a glass (or two...or three) of prosecco and amazing seafood + shellfish before moving on to their healthy but yummy fresh salads. Onward to the prepared food display (delicious and cleverly-presented crab tins are to die for) and an impressive selection of cold and hot dishes (including juicy Beef Wellington).  We bypass the omelette pit-stop in favour of cheese + OMG breads....before reaching our final destination.....DESSERTS (the Paris Brest is beyond...beyond...). Incredible service  + selections + setting = a great weekend 'getaway'.
