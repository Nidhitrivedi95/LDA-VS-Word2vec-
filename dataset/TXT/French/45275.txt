mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q ignore all the other sub-5 star reviews. this place is amazing, and has easily replaced our fave place in vegas, if not THE WORLD. tips:

a) get your concierge to book you prime seats at the bar. not to watch the chefs in action, why would you want to watch your food being made instead of eating it? sit at the bar to convo with your server (and sommelier)!
b) cave and try the breads. with the butter. it IS worth it.
c) don't waste space on the full-sized dishes. get the tasting portions.
d) don't worry about what to get. it's all amazing.
e) get the wine pairing, upgraded if your wallet can handle it (and if you're tipsy enough). they'll make it worth it. thank you, ben!
