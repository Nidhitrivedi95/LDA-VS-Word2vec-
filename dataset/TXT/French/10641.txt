4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw SIMPLY INCREDIBLE!!' First time here and not a SINGLE thing to diss about~ excellent menu!, excellent server! No names used only numbers ours was #71. He joined in on our reverie~ we had an excellent table on the rim of the patio. Actually could see the dancing waters across the street. A nice little extra bonus~the food!!! Yes! I am gonna say it again EXCELLENT !! We 3 had  steaks, each a different way. Merlot sauce, maiter'd butter & bernaise just sooo good. Had a great cocktail a "French Romance!" The price point is wonderful! I live here and can't wait to go back!!!
