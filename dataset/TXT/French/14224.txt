58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw After pretty much only sticking to a few local chains for breakfast I can honestly say Le Cartet is a must try for brunch. The staff is welcoming and super attentive, the food is honest and delicious, and the airy atmosphere just exudes good energy and warmth. We managed to beat the rush on 1/1 but the place got really busy towards the end of our meal. Get there, order Les Cantons (which comes in a cast-iron skillet), order the fresh juice, and enjoy the rest of your day.
