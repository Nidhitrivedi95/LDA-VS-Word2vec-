wwgRu0TAMX8rfRhsiI0ifQ We were SO impressed with bistro 57! 

We came here for my birthday dinner, wanting something a little nicer than the buffet for a change. Wasn't sure how it would rate, a lot of places in North Vegas LOOK great but can't back it up with their food. That was NOT the case here! We were seated at a very elegant booth and a great waiter (Brandon?) took really excellent care of us. 

We ordered two glasses of Merlot, the goat cheese-marinara garlic bread appetizer and some bruschetta to start. Heavenly. BIG portion appetizers, fresh ingredients and beautifully presented. Wow! We followed it up with a lasagna dinner entree. So fresh and flavorful, one of the best lasagnas out there. 

Our waiter was perfect: not over bearing, not ignoring us....just the perfect level of attentiveness and that made for a perfect dining experience. That's experience for you, it shows. Especially loved that the chef came out into the dining room and greeted each table asking about the food. Nice guy, very genuine! 

I am coming back often. The food is superb and the service was outstanding. Loved it!
