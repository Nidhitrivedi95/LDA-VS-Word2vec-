B56AYe5GNuavMDtwFsXqzA Well after reading all the great reviews and local TV cookouts we finally made it to Petite Maison tonight.
We were greeted and promptly seated by the staff and the restaurant is clean and very charming inside and out.
Vincent was our waiter for tonight and he made us feel right at home and paid close attention to our needs.
We started out with the Mushroom Ravioli which were very well prepared but I did not care to much for the side ingredients.
Next we had the Salmon and Seafood platter as our main course and the presentation of the food was nice but not overwhelming.
I did once again did not care for some of the ingredients in the dishes but then again we all have different taste-buds.
Now I admin that I am probably spoiled by the cooking I grew up with in Germany and Austria but one thing missing in our dinning experience was the wow factor.  
The desert also was on the so-so factor. We had the ice-cream  profiteroles which was well prepared but the Ice-cream was too frozen to enjoy the real flavor.
Again I give credit for the great location and friendly staff and highly recommend this place to anybody if you are looking for a great place for a romantic dinner.
I recommend Le Sans Souci Restaurant in Cave Creek for your comparison and let you be the judge.
Thank you Chef Porter for a nice evening.
Best regards.
