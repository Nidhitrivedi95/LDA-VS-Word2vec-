ysJo5Jdo29XOBCnKrbUKWg I like the concept, but the food is not great at this cute little bistro. We went when it first opened, and I resisted the urge to review them then, as I wanted to give them time to straighten out the kinks. They have done that to a certain extent...they've fixed the ventilation system, and the buckwheat crepes, which used to have a grainy, sandy texture to them, are much better. The fillings, however, are uninspired and not handled with care. I got the Dijon mustard chicken crepe, and the chicken was bone dry. The filling was not enough for the size of the crepe, and they also need to sauce them more. I prefer crepe fillings that are either more stew-like or have a sauce to finish them, and these are just a pile of ingredients on top of a crepe. The soup of the day was watermelon gazpacho, which would have been excellent had they not dumped in so much cayenne, which made it overly spicy and strangely one note. 

We were sat near the open kitchen when we first went in, and the clanking of pots, pans and plates was just too much for me, so I asked if they could move us. They did, and it was a little better, but this is a noisy restaurant, due to its petite size and tile floors.
