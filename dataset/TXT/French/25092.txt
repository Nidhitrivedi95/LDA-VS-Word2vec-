However, the reason we picked this place for a romantic dinner was because we had read that the 46th floor view was stunning.  

1) the view in the restaurant is NOT nice.  If you want a nice strip view, get appetizers and drinks in the lounge, but do not commit to a full dinner...you won't have a view

2) the seating along the window faces away from the window.  Not one person sitting at the window can see out of it without looking away from their dinner date

3) everything except for the red water glasses and pink tealight holders is white...EVERYTHING.  The well intended decor would be interesting, but instead it feels slightly like a mental institution with abstract curves and balls of glass hanging from the ceiling while offering nothing stimulating to look at.

Stick to the lounge.  We had a drink there after and instantly regretted the $300 meal we had in the restaurant with nothing but our waiter's service and personality to make the experience worthwhile
