Dcj69NZJnbJhK-YHP_nULA The beer selection is amazing! They have specific glassware from the maker for every beer I have had there. The mussels are really good and come with a huge thing of frites. Definitely have to share unless you are starving. The bartenders are really good with selections if you are overwhelmed by the 4-5 page beer list. They have some of the common beers from around town but I find it much more exciting to get a little adventurous. I highly recommend trying one of the two sour beers listed. I had bigger expectations for the goat cheese salad and it almost pushed me to a three star but I realized we didn't go there for a salad we went for the beer, mussels, and deviled eggs! All of which were spot on!
