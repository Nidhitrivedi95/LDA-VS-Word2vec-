lQ9VmIWvM6v-rONPkYX8aQ I would only expect Alex to present a little espresso/rum/marscapone surprise in a little glass cup to "pick-me-up" after a LAVISH and FILLING dinner. This has set the bar for my quest to find really good tiramisu, but I'm afraid I have already found the best before my quest even began...

more about the WONDERFUL food and ambiance later...
