The owners are in the restaurant working hard everyday to ensure that you get the best experience.  They recommended that we do family style with our meals, and that's what we did.  It worked out perfectly!  They also ensure that all of their food comes from local sources and are organic as well.  They are definitely worth every dollar spent here.  Enjoy!
