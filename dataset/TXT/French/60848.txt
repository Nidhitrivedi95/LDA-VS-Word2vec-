SD7vTf-H00J8BS3L-kt7jg One of my best friends had organized her own birthday to be held in Grinder in a special private room on the second floor near the back of the facility.  It's a completely separate room which used to be an apartment that the restaurant just bought out and added it to their own.  It had about 6 large tables and could seat upwards of 40+ people if necessary but this party was going to be smaller than that. 

The party was going to be on the Saturday but we were able to come in on Friday evening and set up the place with all the decorations and set up the tables the way we wanted.  I have to say the staff here was very accommodating and helpful which included the valet at the front to the individuals who allowed us access to the room and showed us the set up etc.

We had a menu to choose from for this special event being held in the back and considering this place has their own boucherie (butcher shop) right across the street it's safe to say the quality of meats as well as other dishes served here would be as fresh as could be.  

In addition to the variety of starters which were being served the choices for the menu consisted of a variety of meats  with fish choices as well.  For starters we had had the beef tataki which was served with cashews and bacon while my wife had the candied salmon which were perfect as tasters.  For our mains we had the skirt steak and tuna steak.  

While this was a still a private function the chef which was looking after the party had a very good variety of choices and the quality of the dishes were great.  I enjoyed both desserts as well, one which was sort of a chocolate lava and the other was sort of a caramel crumble.
