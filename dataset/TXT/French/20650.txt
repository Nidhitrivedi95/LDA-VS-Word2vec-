AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw Payard on the outside seems like it would be wonderful, however, the limited menu, overly buttery breakfast items and average baked goods can't compete with other options in the area. If you are in a pinch and in between stops, it can't hurt. Not something I would seek out again.
