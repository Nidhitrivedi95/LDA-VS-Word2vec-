mT8Ej8sKFJoIa5G0Vl4AKA As a tourist I struggled with having dinner at a chain restaurant much like those in the States. 

I wanted a real experience of authentic/local cuisine, but it wasn't half bad. I was pleasantly surprised. 

The staff was super attentive and friendly. A friendly staff goes a long way. Plenty of booths for large groups. Tables are spread so you're not hearing every detail of your neighbor's conversation. 

I have a weakness for fries - and I remember a heaping plate of fries that were fun to munch on with my meal.
