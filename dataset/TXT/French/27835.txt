dubu2kN3Y9EB4uYGFWa0MQ I stay at Monte Carlo all the time. Love these new restaurants they're adding. This is my first time eating at Primrose. Great looking and nice hosts. Waiters are super nice. Ordered the Cobb salad. Jesus I didn't know a salad can taste this good. Think I would give up eating all my fattening food if I can get salads like this more often. Will come again and again.
