4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Great place for dinner right in the Paris hotel. Our server was wonderful and let us enjoy a slow-paced meal even though the large restaurant was extremely crowded. We had wonderful steak frites platters and a nice bottle of wine. Would definitely return, especially given how easy it was to make a reservation online!
