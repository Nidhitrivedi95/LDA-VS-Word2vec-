H464UiJ5c7q5dAJ14h731A I discovered this place by another elite member
Went out with one of my besties for dinner
We simply loved!!!
The chef is amazing, the stuff is great
The food is more than delicious and they are super attentionated to details and your food allergies
I'm not a super fun of pepper sauce, but their home made are to die for, they have 3 kinds but preferred is the middle one, sweet and hot...
I got an oysters, 2 starters and 2 main dishes 
We got the lamb shops and the duck confit 
The lamb were super delicious and they have some great wines too that go well as an accord with your meal.
Can't wait to go back!!!
