Came here for winterlicious as a party of 5. None of us ordered off the winterlicious menu. We tried the burger, drunken tuna, octopus and flank steak + frites. Steak came out cold. Druken tuna was completely unseasoned. Burger was ok - a little overdone.

Octopus was like eating rubber and served on a completely unseasoned chickpea "pancake" which was mushy and just awful. Whoever thought this up, do yourself a favour and replace it with a polenta. Pinot noir from California was exceptional. Only giving one star for the wine and bread.

When one of my girlfriends brought it to our servers attention that we were all unsatisfied, she took offense in the blink an eye. Stating that they must be doing something right because they are "always busy." She said we should've complained right away - but we don't think all 5 of us sending back our meals would've flown over well either.

Our waitress then proceeded to bring out a dessert platter for our lacklustre experience - cute; except all the desserts sucked too! 

Atmosphere and decorations are lovely but food is not worth it at all. Worst $30 i've ever spent on a meal.
