3rj1qpgFvkRWtAka17mhEQ I am a fan of Mimi's from way back.  I think their first restaurant was in Anaheim, where I grew up.  So I was sorry to find that the Mimi's in Centennial is a disaster.  I'm pretty sure it's the management's fault - or the LACK of effective management.  Sometimes, service isn't too bad, but I have had 2 visits that were just awful.  I think they are under-staffed.  And they don't have enough glassware or silverware - so sometimes they just run out!  This location also doesn't have any alcohol, just beer and wine.  The food quality is ok - it's the service that is bad here.  There are so many fabulous restaurants in Vegas, there's no reason to ever visit this Mimi's again!  If you're nearby - try Rachel's instead or even the Einstein Brothers bagel place will be a better experience!
