4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw This place has a 5 star location in terms of view. In terms of wait time it and chaos, it probably only gets a 1 star. The architects designing this place clearly had no concept of crowd control. Trying to get in and out was ridiculous. Combine that with the bathroom being outside the restaurant; it was miserable trying to push through the crowds to get out and wash my hands.

Reservations were easy to make on my Yelp iPhone app via Opentable. We showed up; was seated after a lengthy delay (they DO NOT honor your reservation time!). Our server was super nice and made sure our side dishes were low on the calories and cooked in olive oil and not butter after conferring with the chefs.

Bread and butter plus a fennel apple salad appetizer was placed on the table. When I knocked over Hubs' freshly poured glass of wine, they were nice enough to replace it. We both ordered steak frites; cooked well and the portions were huge. 

We also tried the french onion soup which was a solid hit.

Touristy and crowded.
