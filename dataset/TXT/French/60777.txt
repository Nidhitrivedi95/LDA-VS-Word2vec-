SCklYa_jhihWAcfIn-_chg I love the ambiance of Bonjour brioche, especially in the summer months, with perfect lilting jazz. Brunching alfresco or inside, the place has the perfect cozy feel to it which instantly relaxes you, and puts you in a "i-have-all-the-time-in-the-world" conversation mode with your fellow brunchers.

I really like the hot chocolate(which i've ordered every single time i've been here), the quiche & french toast. The salad can be a bit soggy from dressing overload at times, but its easily fixed by just ordering dressing on the side. 

Overall one of my favourite brunch spots, more so for the laid back cozy ambiance than just for the food itself.
