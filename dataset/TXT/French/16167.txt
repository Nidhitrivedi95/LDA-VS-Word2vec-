Wizard chef duo Marc and Olivier are at the helm of this classic French institution. What started as a passion project many years ago, has slowly grown to become one of the most solid & reputable tables in all of Montreal. 

Step inside, and don't expect much. Sleek black and white picture frames line the luxe banquettes, giving a clean, minimalistic aesthetic... the perfect canvas for a wild, imaginative and colorful cuisine. And the seasonal, local and market fresh ingredients are an amazing foundation for each dish.

Service is top notch. I'd even go as far as saying it's some of the best in the city. Their sommelier is excellent and suggested incredible wines to pair with our dishes.

The wait staff is present (meaning my water glass was always magically full), but you never get the feeling that they are hovering or lingering too long. Their timing was truly incredible in everything -- from plate delivery, to silverware changes... it was flawless and never felt too slow or too rushed.  

If you aren't pressed with time, order the tasting menu with the wine pairing. You won't regret it! In my opinion, it rivals the menus offered at Toqué and Europea (at a lesser cost too!)

La Chronique is more of a word-of-mouth kind of restaurant, but ever since I heard about it many years ago, I recommend it to everyone. This is a true classic fine dining establishment that is very underrated. And if you're looking to celebrate a special occasion or impress a date, you'll be in great hands.

The life of a restaurateur / chef is not an easy one, so kudos to Marc & Olivier for reinventing La Chronique time and time again. Here's to many more years of success!
