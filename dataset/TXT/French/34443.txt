HOev_2CifUcfIm9xDL_uaw Delicious.  They have a ratatouille omelette.  How could you not love that?  The croissants are made in-house, the coffee is not disappointing and the prices are reasonable.
If I lived closer, I could easily see Cafe Paris being a once a week visit for me.
Down side?  Welll, once we had finished eating, it seemed like we were ignored.  No more water or coffee.  Otherwise, this would have been a 4 star review.
