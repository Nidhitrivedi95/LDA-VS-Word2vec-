m4PW-GMc8JOU5nmMYncu-Q Le Lab is one of those fancy cocktail lounges with one of those fancy neon martini glass signs outside. Much like the neon sign, the interior of Le Lab is decorated with a reddish ambience and fancy rustic character. Fancy that.

The slick bartenders can mix up some special cocktails from behind the bar. The 2 cocktails I had there were pretty good - not super good, but still pretty good. 

The one down side is the steep price tag that comes with the cocktail. The size is pretty small compared to most other places with the same price, and I had to really slow drink it just to have enough time to soak in the ambience.
