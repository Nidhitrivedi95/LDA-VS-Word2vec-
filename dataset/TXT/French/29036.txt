EPb3FWs3mxQLUjGeMNP0SQ As a guest of Hotel Place D'armes I was pleased to see such a beautiful bar/restaurant located within the hotel.  My first night at the hotel we went to the bar at Brasserie 701 for post dinner drinks and dessert.  We were pleased with the bar staff service as well as the desserts ordered.  Being so pleased with this experience we decided to try Brasserie 701 for dinner the following evening.  What a disappointment!  We arrived at the restaurant around 6:30 pm and the restaurant was less than half full and the host asked us if we had a reservation, we stated "no" and he asked if we would be gone by 8:30, we stated yes.  I regret not simply taking a seat at the bar because we received the worst service I think I have ever experienced.  If they didn't want us there due to expectant reservations the host should have simply stated that they were only accommodating reservations.  Although, in the time we were there people only left and very few new patrons came into the restaurant.  During our meal we had a handful of waiters, no one checked to see how our meals were, and no one asked once if we wanted a refill on our drinks.  Too bad, if service had been better we would've ordered dessert and more drinks.  When one of our waiters finally showed up to refill the waters, we asked for the bill.  If it wasn't for the good food I would have given this place a 1.  Food was delicious and I have nothing negative to say about our meals, unfortunately I can't say the same for this poorly run restaurant filled with terrible wait staff.
