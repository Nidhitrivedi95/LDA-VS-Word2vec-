4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Solid 3.5 stars, simply because I just ordered waffles with mixed berries for a quickie before I splurge on hopefully a Wicked Spoon buffet lol.

Texture was to be expected for a French resto, same for the patio view.  Strawberries, blueberries and blackberries, sprinkled ever so lightly with white sugar powder.  A bit on the lean side but i'm being picky.

  I'm sure I'll return for the dinner to try their favourites as it's a nice date worthy place to go, fancy white linen and all.

Just did pickup.
