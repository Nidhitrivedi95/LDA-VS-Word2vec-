Instead of thinking of this as a meal, it really is a show- it's a performance of food. Unlike other shows, all of your senses are engaged here. It's a whimsical experience- you are put in a small, dark room with 6 other strangers (my husband was with me) and you're taken on a culinary adventure. You eat things and taste things that cognitively don't make sense. We had frozen sangria, manchego butter, foie gras and corn nuts stuffed in cotton candy empanadas, smoked oysters, and soaked muscles. It was magical. They also have great wine pairings, but I found two glasses of wine was enough. I've been to Bazaar (in LA) and while there are some similar elements, this place is definitely unique. My husband made reservations months in advance, so plan accordingly.
