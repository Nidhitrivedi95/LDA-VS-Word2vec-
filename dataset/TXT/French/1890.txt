0JGMKaKJGVuDus5WcJzvjw Great spot. As hard to get into as Joe Beef after Justin & Obama enjoyed a meal here. I've been several times. Great atmosphere & friendly servers. I always have fun here! My husband adores their lobster spaghetti. I don't have a favourite meal here- but have never left disappointed. Everything is pretty yummy. My only gripe is their washroom: It smells like piss - come on!!! That's not a scent that opens the appetite....wish they'd deal with that & I'd give this place 5*!
