T4shscbr3BU3yb6EA3BSfA Came here for dessert, hoping to try their infamous Lichee granite....unfortunately, they didn't have it anymore (so please take it off your online menu!). But what we got instead was a delight!  Their feature "Green" dessert was refreshingly good (unfortunately I don't remember what was in it, lol - bad yelper).  Also had the Lime Curd - don't be fooled by the 'curd' - this was a 'deconstructed' dessert made of crispy Matcha tea cake, strawberries, vanilla, thai basil.  Put a bit of each on your spoon and you will have the perfect bite with the basil giving it just the right amount of POP!

Accompany this with a nice glass of dessert wine and it's the perfect end to the night.

Ambience is very nice. Cool, hip, classy. Service is accommodating and unpretentious as well.
