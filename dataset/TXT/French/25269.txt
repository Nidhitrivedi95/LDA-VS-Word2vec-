Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA Mix Lounge is attached to the restaurant so while waiting for our table, we had drinks and then after dinner, we ended up staying here. Just as the restaurant, the view is breathtaking (64 floors up). I loved the fact that they had tables outside to enjoy the fresh air and the view. All the tables are open for everyone until about 10PM (or something like that) and then some of them are closed off for table service.

However, there is still ample seating, which was a total plus for me. The bathroom was another crazy feature. I liked the fact that one of the stalls has a glass wall to the outside! It's like your doing your business on top of the world (or at least that's how it feels like). hahaha The one thing I didn't like about it was that it's very close to the men's bathroom and if you're not careful (and especially if you're drunk) you can walk into the wrong one (no doors to the bathrooms). Some guy was looking into the women's bathroom while a friend and I walked in. 

The music was okay. The drinks were decent but the bartender was very quick to help us so we didn't have to wait too long. 

It was fun but I was hoping we all would've gone somewhere else after a while. However it was good to get drinks before and after dinner so I can't complain.
