UxWH8zRYIBgs6Q2oykvRdw We had the sesame asparagus, baked cheese with mushroom and salmon tartar. Everything tasted good and had good portion sizes. The salmon tartar was one of the best things I've ever eaten, light and full of flavour. The cheese was good but expensive and the asparagus were alright but cheap. I would go again but would make sure to make a reservation as we ended up eating at the bar.
