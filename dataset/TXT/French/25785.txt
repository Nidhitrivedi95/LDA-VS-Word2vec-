Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA This is probably my favorite bar/lounge on the strip. It never gets too packed here, there are plenty of tables and seating in the lounge area, and best of all is the amazing view from anywhere inside Mix including in the restrooms! I've been here a few times and almost always try to bring visiting friends and family here, or at least recommend that they check it out. I haven't tried their restaurant, but heard they have a daily happy hour. 

Sometimes the line for the elevator can get a little long here but I've never had to pay cover just to go up. Drinks are standard strip pricing so expect to pay about 8-9 bucks for a beer. Bar service is top notch though and even when there's a crowd there I can get in and out with my drinks pretty quickly.

There are booths for bottle service both inside and on the balcony. Mix also has a small dance floor in front of the elevators, but this is mostly a lounge atmosphere so no one is ever really dancing! This is a classy joint but dress code isn't enforced too stricly as I've seen people walking around in shorts and/or t-shirts...
