4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Got a reservation for 815 pm on a Monday night for inside sitting since thats all you can reserve for. Patio is first come serve. I'm my opinion the hostesses  were a bit rude with people. The waiter was not so friendly neither, and forgot our hors d'oeuvre/ hor devours. Their bread and red onion mix is good. We tried the Filet Mignon Merlot (to die for) also the steak Classic and Bordelaise. Along with a ceasers salad. A meal for four came out for $140, reasonable I think for Vegas and Paris hotel. We would like to go back for brunch.
