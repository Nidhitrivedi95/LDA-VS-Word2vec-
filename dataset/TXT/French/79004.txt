ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug Our bachelorette party of 8 went in since we had vouchers for a lot of food for almost nothing. We ordered so much food I can't remember everything we ate. I do know we ordered the Croque Monsieur, a couple French Onion Soups, 2 Roasted Beet Salads, Seared Tuna Salad, 2 burgers, and some other things. 

The tiny Croque Monsieur was fine but when we got it, it looked like a large plate with a random block of brown sitting haphazardly on it. However, fair enough, it was decent. 

The Roasted Beet Salad was fine, too, but I've had better and I didn't even realize there was beet in the salad until about half-way into eating it.

The French Onion Soup would have been good if it weren't for how salty it was. I'm pretty sure it would have been good. I couldn't really tell from all the salt.

The food wasn't at the level that I was expecting but at $4 per person for all that food, I had a happy belly and wallet.
