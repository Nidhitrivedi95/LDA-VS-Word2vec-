Bartender was very friendly and had me sample a number of wines to make sure I was happy with my selection. You can see the chef cook your food with a open concept space, I love this idea because the space has to be very organized and clean. Food was prepared perfectly and they have a great fresh menu. I had the Creme Brule for dessert and I almost died it was so good!
