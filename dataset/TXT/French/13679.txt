The ingredients had more potential than the execution. I was dining on my own and the main course arrived lukewarm on a hot plate. The cooking could be better, but it was a good, complete meal, in a pleasant, relaxing environment. A family was celebrating a birthday at the next table and the server added a sparkler to the birthday girl's dessert without being asked -- nice  touch.
