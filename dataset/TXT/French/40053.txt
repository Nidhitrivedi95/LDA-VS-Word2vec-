K67pkQljTFTW_P-7xUQrFw Not a bad BYOB. We ended up there on a busy Saturday night, but we were seated within five minutes for a group of ten. Service was slow at parts. The bread was good though (fresh and still warm). I ordered a Filet mignon, and it was delicious (nice and tender with great flavors). Pricing is a little high for small portions though (I would have expected slightly more sides with the beef. Overall, food is good, service is slow, price is a little high. Not a bad place to start off an evening with friends.
