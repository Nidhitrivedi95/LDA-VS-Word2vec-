yIBeZebnXb-hvexqknnDCg They have free valet parking . The house is beautiful and cozy. The wait staff were very nice and professional. Got history of the house , which was cool. The food exceptional. Was given a cantaloupe gazpacho to starts things off. Yummy! I had crab cakes and a beet salad for starters. Wonderful! Then green apple sorbet before the main course, beautifully presented with a punk sugar rim. Had the grouper as a main course with polenta. Amazing !!! The dessert was chocolate and out of this world ! Best restaurant I have eaten at in Charlotte.
