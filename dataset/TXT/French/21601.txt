bEVWHtBRYVwqaaNF4mWNYg BEST OGNION SOUP IN TORONTO ?????  NO WAY !!!  Le Select Bistro still has the best onion soup in my view....
It says a lot when the waiter comes to your table and mentions that its been voted #1 in three years.  It feels cheap to say that and makes the restaurant feel touristique.

So the soup was uneventful, lack any flavour and the cheese was not grilled but melted which made you eat big chunk of melted cheese..

The main course was served while we were still eating the entrees...A BIG NO NO  !!!  I did't come to eat at a BUFFET !

I ordered the mushroom ravioli...good...but too much mushroom....stuff mushroom ravioli with mushroom sauce and cooked mushrooms on top....this lack imagination...The spinach/olives and tomatoes were also on the plate.

My wife got the salad Coquine....The walnuts  were at the bottom of the plate, the cheese were huge chunks...this lack refinement....

In conclusion this place feels like a suburban restaurant dressed like a French Bistro...

One more funny note..... the reputation of this place being called Cougarville was true.....;)
