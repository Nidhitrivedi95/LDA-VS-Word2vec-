YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g It's lunch time..What's not to love?  Let's see.. Renowned Chef n menu options, Great open yet tranquil setting, nice to sit-relax-take-a-load-off while people watching in the midst of a busy, sunlit indoor AC controlled promenade.

Wonbo, our server was most delightful and pleasant and set the tone.  

We ordered a BLT that was prob one of the best I've tasted .. It was spicy, the aroma of the smoked bacon could even be enjoyed from across the table and each one of the flavors, coupled with the hot, cool crunch experience.. Heaven! I enjoyed a few decadent bites and controlled myself and didn't rip it off the plate that 'twas not mine :-)

I always ask the Server their personal top favs and the 2nd was the burger, which is apparently what they're known for.   It was cooked to perfection, the char was perfect and overall, it was good (but not as good as the BLT though)

Both entrees were plated simply and it was a memorable experience.

Ps- we dined around 1pm, lunch plates were not huge yet we were stuffed the entire day..
