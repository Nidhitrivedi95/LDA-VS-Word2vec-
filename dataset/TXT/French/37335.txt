j_ekKIxKrUKc_D-PW2y4tw I used to come to this place when it was under thr old management all the time. It is no where close to what it used to be. A girlfriend and I went for breakfast. Some tables were served water as soon as they were seated. Not us though. We were not served our food at the same time. I only got my plate about 10 minutes after my friend. Toast came out another 10 minutes after that. The food was mediocre at best. Comprable to a pitstop dinner breakfast. Undercooked eggs, overcooked sausage and sloppy potatoes. I don't plan on returning. Over all an unpleasant brunch. At least they were attentive with refilling our coffee cups if nothing else.
