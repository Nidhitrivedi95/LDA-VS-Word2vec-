BSmqxPbQglQwP2R56OqOag Came on a busy Friday night. All the extras were great: the waitress, the focaccia bread with flavored butter, good drinks, free DD drink, seated within manageable amount of time, and great atmosphere. 
The app we got drunk bread was relish and the desserts were amazing: Nutella mousse, pan a cotta, & tiramisu! 
Sadly, the entrees were not worth it. I had the such heavy dressing on my salad it was limp lettuce steak salad. Friends had the pork entre which was the best. Other friend had Bolognese and the meatball was the only good part of the homemade yet undercooked pasta dish. Last friend got pork rigatoni and it was tasty but overly salty.  

I say skip the entrees. you can't nail salad and pasta as a chef?
 you only can eat here if you're willing to shell out $30 a plate for the fancy entree.
