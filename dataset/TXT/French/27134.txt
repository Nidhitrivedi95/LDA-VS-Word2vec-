dd3GZs6zW2t7BM0cbxAzvg This place was a great yelp find! 

My Mom just arrived in town and she was thinking of just going to the Keg. I, however, was looking to try something new and decided on a cute French place close to the hotel. This place was a winner!

I thought I would be disappointed with the brunch/lunch menu, but everything was perfect. 

We started with the foie gras and a bottle of the Malbec (Mi Terruño, I think?). Then we each decided to take the 2/3 prix fixe (with the plan to share everything). We ended up getting the escargots, the burger, and the Quack of Dawn (ducks egg served inside a duck sausage contraption. Delicious!

The only bad comment that we both had (which, to be honest, is mostly our fault) was that the food is super rich. Never the less, we ate every bit of the brandy icecream. :D
