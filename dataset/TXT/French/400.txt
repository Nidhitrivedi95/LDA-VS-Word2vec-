-ClafaRWkSRTfieIzO4r3Q Went there for a quick Saturday night dinner. Good thing I got a reservation as the place is small! We got sat right away and the servers was very attennative and hug our coats. Ordered the DTF cocktail made with gin and cucumber.  It was very refreshing and very nice. On to the apps. Oysters were a mix of r
French kiss, raspberry pointànd malpeuqe. Very fresh and tasty. Mussels and Frites were good with a white wine sauce and served with aioli. Almost a meal in itself. But the best appetizer was the southern trio sampler. Trust me if you like seafood it a go to. Next were the mains. I got the pork belly and catfish. The pork belly was fine..nice and tender and the catfish was fried nicely however the problem I encountered with the dish was the sauce was too overpowering..maybe order it with less sauce? My companion had the Jambalaya. Chicken breast was very well done and moist and the sauce was amazingly done but the rice was dry and not as savory.  The venue itself is cozy with a nice atmosphere. It's at the start of the junction strip and it seems to be a regular' s spot. I would recommend and i will go again. Great for cozy dates. Prices are ok considering what you get.
