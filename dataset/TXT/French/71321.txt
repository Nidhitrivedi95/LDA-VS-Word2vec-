xcmmTXhuMx2fZF2Bt69F4w We were brought here for brunch when we were visiting from out of town. Point Brugge Cafe is in an adorable neighborhood. The restaurant itself is intimate.

The Sunday Brunch menu is great. There's something for everyone featured on it but it's not a huge, overwhelming menu. They've got waffles, salads and omelettes. One of their feature brunch dishes are their mussels, though. I'm not a mussels fan so I didn't indulge in these but everyone else at my table got them and said they always get them. You choose a dish smothered in a sauce (shallots, garlic cream was a popular choice at my table) and the mussels come served with a big piece of buttery toasted bread that just looked amazing.

You MUST get the Brugge frites. One order is a huge plate of delicious skinny fries and I could eat the whole plate by itself. Definitely the best part of the meal.
