7Ug8zCmY6iDTewxWqeYQ2g This review comes a little late, as we visited last August-- so almost 6 months ago, but this was possibly one of the best meals I've had for the price in my life.

The server did an incredible job of explaining the specials and was happy to elaborate when we had questions.

I really will have to apologize because since it was so long ago, I can't remember exactly what we had, but I'll do my best. I had a foie gras dish that was out of this world, my rabbit for my main was tender and juicy served with andouille sausage. My boyfriend had the surf and turf that was served with a roast duck leg instead of steak, which was a really nice twist and a lobster tail. Even the salads, which on a price fixe menu can be boring, were lovely-- the pickled vegetables in them added a little acidic zip.

Basically, we had a fantastic multi course meal for under $100. We tipped well since there was no corkage on the wine and everything was wonderful.. The ambiance was small and humble, but I really can't fault this place for anything. Especially the value. We will most certainly be back the next time we're in Montreal and I'll urge all my foodie friends to visit for a memorable dining experience.
