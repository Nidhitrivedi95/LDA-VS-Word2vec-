fyJAqmweGm8VXnpU4CWGNw Food was wonderful, we had the spinach & mushroom crepe & a second lunch special (it was like a ham & cheese pannini) both were very good. I also had a fruit tart that was extremely tasty. There are only a few lunch options to choose from, but several desserts & bakery items. I'll definitely go back to see the different lunch options.
