w2tr0PA0b3tg8pId0kjM-A Went here during the soft opening.  There was a bit of a line, but it moved quickly and everyone seemed genuinely happy to be there.

We tried a few of the macarons. I was a fan, but my husband didn't like them as much.  I felt that the rose flavored macaron was overpowering, but the others such as earl grey and strawberry, were much more balanced.

We also tried on of the pretty cakes (small one). I don't remember what the name was, but it was banana and chocolate.  My husband loved this.  I found the texture too soft, but the flavors were delicious.

The last thing we tried was a pain au chocolat.  I liked it and thought the chocolat was very high quality, but I thought it was not as crunchy and flakey as I would have liked.  

I can't wait to go back and try some more things
