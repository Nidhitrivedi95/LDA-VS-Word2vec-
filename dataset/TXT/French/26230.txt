d482l58ho0_IMdFkXX1F5Q I had an outstanding meal last night. One of the best meals I've had on the strip lately. 

The room is done classic brasserie style, it's warm and comforting. The service across the board was impeccable. And David, my waiter, was outstanding. He really took care of everything, made sure the food wasn't rushed and was very enjoyable.

And the food! I started with the country pate', one of the better pates I've had. It came with a wonderful homemade mustard and a sublime frisee salad. Next was the Caesar, which I had to try since everyone raves about it. It is indeed amazing. I am not sure I would call it a Caesar, give the pesto involved, but who cares when a salad is this incredible. I finished with a Coq Au Vin, also terrific. I was initially surprised when it was served, as I am used to this dish having a lot of juices/sauce. The bowl was full but with all the elements and not much sauce. Well, that is because the sauce had been reduced to almost a thick syrup that coated everything. Yum. Wonderful. 

I will be back and hope that people continue to discover it. I think it is a little odd that this opened in the same hotel as Bouchon, given the menus are in some ways similar. DB Brasserie, of course, is right in the heart of the casino. I hope that means it will be around for years to come. It's terrific.  onfoodandfilm.com
