rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A We attended a wedding reception here.
We have also been to the Napa Bouchon a couple of years ago, and this Vegas one was just as great as the one in Napa.
The reception was held outdoors near the pool and between some Venetian towers, and it was a very nice atmosphere.  Their food was delicious, just as expected, and overall this was an excellent restaurant ideal for the party.
