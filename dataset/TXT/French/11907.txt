We didn't have any reservations, but were seated right away at a table outside overlooking the fountains.  What a great meal!  The steaks were cooked to perfection, the service was attentive without being overbearing, and the view was unbeatable.  While a little pricey, this place is reasonably priced for what you're getting.  I'll be sure to eat here at least once next time I come to Vegas.
