4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I've never really been a fan of french food, but this is hands down my favorite french restaurant. I make sure to come here every time I'm in Vegas.

I've tried the beef wellington, skate wing, garlic spinach, bread pudding, lobster roll, cauliflower soup, seafood crepe, and french toast. The complimentary bread and butter are so good, I can eat it for days. I thoroughly enjoyed most of the things I tried besides the beef wellington, skate wing, and french toast. The beef wellington and skate wing didn't suit my taste. I'm not a fan of the texture of skate wing and discovered I hate capers after trying this dish. As for the french toast, I felt like it was missing something.

Service is very friendly and nice. This place is great for a romantic date or for a casual brunch. I'll be coming back very soon :D

P.S., the bread pudding is very heavy......so try sharing it with at least 3 people. The bf and I almost died trying to finish it.
