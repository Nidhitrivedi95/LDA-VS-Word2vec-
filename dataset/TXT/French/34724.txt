HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw super friendly staff. the food at the table was very good. the steak and the pork where just fair but some of the other food was great. chimay blue on tap is something ive never heard of. the restaurant does not have a bakery but i still had a pay a plate charge for my friends birthday cake which i did not think was fair considering the drink prices and food prices.
