ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug quick short review.

took around 20 to 30 mins to get our drink orders in.

took 15 mins after that to get our food order in.

order soup + salad deal for around $14.00

received the soup in about 15 mins. received the salad 15 mins after the soup

it came with a cup of soup (not even a bowl) and a petite salad

not the best tasting soup or salad. at least bread was good
