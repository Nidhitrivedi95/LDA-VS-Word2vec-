LtDYRcMJbJPhXPEklT29Fw Just had one of the best meals ever.  The rabbit was better than best I remembered since France.  The service was great.  The owner acted like he had nothing better to do than talk to us.  Then a waiter invited us to tour the   kitchen!
From cocktails and apps (make sure you try the terrine) at the bar to great dinner this was memorable.
