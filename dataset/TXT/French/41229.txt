kGOr_D-LNpgZ2M9N8TT4QQ My boyfriend and I came here for the Winterlicious price fixe menu ($35 dinner), and we had an amazing time. The Winterlicious price is a steal - I'm not sure we'd come here otherwise (except for a very special occasion), as the regular menu is quite expensive. 

The staff were friendly, attentive, and helpful. The food was absolutely amazing (best French Onion Soup I've ever had!) and the staff were highly accommodating of my gluten intolerance, even going so far as to put together a special dessert for me, as all the menu items contained gluten (including the mousse, which typically doesn't). We ended up ordering a bottle of wine, as most glasses were between $12 - $18, and a bottle of my favourite Gewürztraminer was $42, so it was better bang for our buck to go for the bottle.
