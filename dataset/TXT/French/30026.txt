fNCyfJOfd2R42hkhz2tALQ The service at the restaurant was great, the food was also really good! To start off, I ordered the fried calamari and it was one of the best calamari I have ever had! There was a dill pickle sauce on the side that was really good as well. For the main, I ordered the steak frites with mushroom sauce. Let me tell you, I have no complaints about the food there at all. 

In addition, it is also a bring your own wine place! (which is always a bonus :)).
