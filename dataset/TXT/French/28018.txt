DwJlGxAJvohbDR_5jV-ERA i imagine the food here is quite amazing but we came for drinks only. they have over 100 beers from all over the world and a great terrace! i had the peche mortel and la fin du monde beers. both delicious! my friend's mango margarita was pretty strong too. what gives this place 4 stars is that it was a sweltering night: 90+ degreses and our hostess lent us her fan until she personally brought us two glasses of water. now THAT'S customer service!
