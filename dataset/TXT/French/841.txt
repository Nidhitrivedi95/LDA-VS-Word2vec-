_cjPEH9wXhKS-HQe_U3M4Q First visit last night. Liked the duo de gravalax although it was a bit salty. The poulet grille was awful . Very bland chicken and vegetables were covered in sauce that was too sweet and had a powerful vinegar taste. Room is very nice and they were accomodating despite no reservation. 
We also had the steak frites which were a bit of a let down as well. Frites were good but steak was tough. Strictly for french food lovers
