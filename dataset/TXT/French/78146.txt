YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING!!!!! Flight got delayed so our dinner reservations at joes seafood were canceled... THANK GOD!! Came about 30 minutes before closing, place was pretty empty but they still accommodated us! Started off with field greens salad, bacon (but it's not bacon it's more like pork belly and it was amazing!), candied walnuts, roasted beets and champagne vinaigrette one of the best salads I've ever had! Our server was VICTORIA, she was very nice and professional, she made wine recommendations for my girlfriend and I which were both exactly what we wanted, very happy! I am an avid steak/steakhouse diner, and if you know your meat you tend to not go off the beaten path for a high quality steak/piece of meat (especially rib eye and tomahawk), I ordered the tomahawk bone in with a side lobster tail. They do serve it pre-cut which for some may be more convenient but I wanted it whole and they gladly obliged! Steak temp arrived EXACTLY how I order, steak was juicy and flavorful! Lobster was good not rubbery or old. We were both EXTREMELY SATISFIED with the service and our meals! 

A special thanks to assistant GM Esther for making the experience even better! Came to the table multiple times to check on us, very polite and professional! 

Thanks for everything we will DEFINITELY be back!!
