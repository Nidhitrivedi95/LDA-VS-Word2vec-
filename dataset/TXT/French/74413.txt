xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g All I can say is wow!

I had the Beef Wellington and I can honestly say it is the best meal I have ever had. I am not generally a big steak or pastry fan, however apparently putting those two things together creates absolute magic!
The view of The Bellagio fountain was amazing as well. If I could I would give this place a 6th star.
The added bonus was I won $600 on a slot machine just before the meal, so it was for all intents and purposes a free meal. Win win!
