JezHN-9KKLTMbojq00VP0g Not a big fan of French cuisine but came here for a girls brunch. Luckily we had a big group and got a nice sized table in the large parlor. I kept hearing about how petite Le petite was and that ain't no joke. Walk thru the front door and it's a bit narrow without a lot of elbow room. Big parlor room was a little stuffy but they ended up opening the back door which helped some. Recommend the quiche and the salmon ceasar salad. Everyone at the table loved what they got. Also has a nice patio out in front. For good food prices were reasonable. I would come back
