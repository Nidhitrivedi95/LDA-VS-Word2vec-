YUFxSG6idHePsxOmnSHtpQ This is my 3rd or 4th time at this location and, as always, the service was excellent.  What was different the past two times though was their new, sparse, menu.  I had bragged up Mimi's to my son saying they have an extensive menu but when we looked online it was a lot smaller than I remembered.  When we got there it was indeed smaller and fairly ordinary to boot.  The food was good but the selection was nothing like it used to be.  And, unfortunately, for the first time my order was undercooked - and not by a little bit.  Wifey and I agreed that it is no longer on our list of personal favorites and that is too bad because it used to be her favorite.
