6fPQJq4f_yiq1NHn0fd11Q This place used to be good a few years ago. Their prices have gone up, used to be around $8 and now its more than $10. Their portions USED to be generous, I couldn't finish one crepe because it was stuffed so much, would have to take half of it home. So thats why I kept returning even though their coffee and hot chocolate is crap and their bottled drinks are, of course, ridiculously overpriced.

It changed for the worse. The other day I came here again, ordered the mixed berry crepe (used to be called a Favorite crepe, thats another thing - they got rid of the French names for the crepes and are now naming them by their toppings). What a huge disappointment - the crepe was folded into a triangle with only a pitiful serving of berries and sauce on top. They used to stuff the crepe with berries and fold it only in half. So I was mostly eating pancake rather than fruit. For $10.50, it's definitely not worth it. Not coming here again no matter how much of a dessert craving I have.
