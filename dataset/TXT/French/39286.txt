jSfnItqaOnEp2nenVF7fCg My husband and I decided to try this place for breakfast in honor of our anniversary. We were not disappointed. We started out with beignets, of course, and they were worthy of New Orleans and smothered in powdered sugar. Hubby had the spinach eggs florentine and I had  their corned beef eggs benedict. Both of us agreed they were lovely dishes. The holandaise sauce was light and creamy and my corned beef hash, made from scratch, was the best I have ever eaten. Hubby found out they had bread pudding, so he opted for a desert with our breakfast. I had a bite, loved the sauce, but was to full to share anymore. Our service was top notch. The owners do the cooking and the woman came over several time to see how we were liking everything. All in all, a very pleasant experience and we will certainly be going back, maybe for lunch next time.
