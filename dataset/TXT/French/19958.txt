I was on my way to the Phantom Theater to pick up my tickets for the night, and I passed by Bouchon Bakery. I was suckered into their macarons. They sell them individually and in a pack. I couldn't resist and I couldn't decide on which to get. My love told me I could get whichever one I wanted, while he orders a turkey cranberry sandwich. 

So I ended up getting that pack. Yes, fat girls' problems, but it's worth it. They were of six different colors, There's a vanilla, chocolate, coffee, pistachio, raspberry, and caramel flavored. I posted a picture of it, colors do get to me. They're not too sweet, which I liked. My favorite ones were the pistachio and the coffee ones. I find the jam inside the raspberry one to be a little too overwhelming. The size is enough to split with someone else, especially if you want a bit of everything at once.

Their sandwiches are pretty good too, especially for a quick lunch. The baguette bread was crunchy on the outside and quite soft in the insides. Too bad I devoured it too soon (I wanted to spend more time with my macarons). The bad part is that you have nowhere to sit and eat. It's like a grab and go cafe.
