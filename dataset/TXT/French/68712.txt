vna49NPM-7B11tcFPTgnsg Food was (again) awesome. The homemade charcuterie on the butcher's block is awesome and tonight I also got the fried lamb square... So good and surprising because served cold!

Quite busy for a Sunday night, and I want to point out that you can buy wine by the glass... Always appreciated when you want to give it a try to multiple choices!
