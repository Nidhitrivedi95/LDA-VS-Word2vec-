ANHCo9X7zu0LdYecc9fk3Q I had a 2 hour layover at B22 so I decided to eat. I ordered a turkey and provolone sandwich on ciatbatta bread from the open refrigerator area and upon checkout, the very nice team member offered to make it fresh and toast even toasted it. I would have eaten it cold as it looked delicious already. He also made my pesto pasta fresh as well! This was my first time ever eating at this restaurant and I will definitely go back to one near my home. All of the staff were friendly, efficient and short waiting for time for fresh food! Every single one of them had smiles on their faces and great attitudes. LJ, because of your immpeciable service, I will be back! My only suggestion is to allow tip when paying. I didn't have any cash.
