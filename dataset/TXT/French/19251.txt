aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw We were there for breakfast.  

I got the spinach omelet and cheese special $17.50. Quite disappointed. Over cooked and rubbery with not much taste.  The toast was hard and crumbly. 

My gf got the Chicken and Waffles with a Crown maple syrup and a sauce Chasseur ( brown sauce with mushroom and shallots)  $27.00.  We asked for the sauce on the side.  The chicken was marinaded for 24 hours. It was juicy but we found it a bit salty and tough. The waffles and Crown syrup were really good. 

The service was fast. Our water and coffee were always filled. My biggest critique is that I spilled most of the sauce Chasseur on the table and the waiter who came by multiple times to fill our coffee and water never cleaned it up or asked if we wanted another sauce.  Quite disappointing for a high end place. 

We also got two croissants. They were super delicious. Buttery and flaky. 

We've been to the Bouchon in Napa and NYC and unfortunately, at least for breakfast, this Bouchon did not live up to the Thomas Keller standard.
