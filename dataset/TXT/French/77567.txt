YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g This is simply just one of the most wonderful French restaurants in Las Vegas.  The service was excellent as the waiters were very knowledgeable, helpful, and prompt.  The ambience has a low key atmosphere which is perfect for a date and probably what you'd expect from a upscale French restaurant.

So let's go on to the food.  My girlfriend and I both ordered the prix fixe menu where we both ordered different items since we wanted to taste as much as we could from Chef Hubert Keller's menu.  We were started off with some small scallop dish that wasn't on the menu complimentary of the chef. So what we had each were:

- Truffle Onion Soup / Ahi Tuna Tartare (Appetizers)
- Chorizo Wrapped Seabass / Braised Short Ribs with guiness foam (Entree)
- Filet Mignon / Ravioli with Parmesan foam
- Chocolate Fondant / Carrot Cake Ice Cream with peanut butter shake/ Pistachio Cake (This one was for our early anniversary)

The food was all excellent.  The short ribs are delicious, but the taste of braised shortribs have never impressed me much.  They were tasty nonetheless.  The paremesan foam was an excellent touch to the ravioli, and the filet mignon was perfectly cooked.  Also, please get the truffled onion soup.  It really wasn't what I was expecting at all, and I'm glad I tried it even though I don't care for onion soup.  

Overall, this was such an enjoyable meal and experience.  Prepare to spend some money though, and the only downside was not being able to meet Chef Hubert Keller!
