zqNgwQjj0_XAll-neGikIw My boyfriend an I live down the street so Merci is a regular spot for us to walk to on the weekends for a nice relaxing brunch. They allow dogs on there small patio which is great for us. The staff are all very kind and if the Owner is in, always makes a point to say hello and ask how everything is. If you are looking for a cute place off the beaten path from the Old Town scene this is the place. The decor is very charming and the food is light but full of flavor. They always have several different types of quiche, and several vegetarian options.  The best part though?...the desserts! I always make sure to try something different each time I go.
