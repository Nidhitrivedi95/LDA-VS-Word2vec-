cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg My first encounter with poutine was at this restaurant - we ordered the poutine with foie gras and it was delicious! All poutines paled in comparison after this. We had the pied de cochon (pig's foot) - the meat was melt in your mouth amazing and perfect for a cold, windy night however the dish was more than enough for two people to share. In addition, we also had the duck breast but to be honest, it was nothing to write home about. 

We did take our 3 1/2 year old daughter with us. The restaurant is noisy so she went unnoticed. I didn't really think it'd be a problem since our kid is pretty well-behaved and is a little cochon when it comes to eating!
