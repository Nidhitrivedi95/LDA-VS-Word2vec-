BSmqxPbQglQwP2R56OqOag We go here every few months and really enjoy ourselves. Food is exceptional and never disappoints. We like to sit at the bar because the tables are very close to each other. The bar area is very nice but the bartenders aren't the friendliest you will find. After going here at least a half dozen times I expect a bartender to at least pretend to notice that we are regulars and at least say something other than "do you know what you want to drink". The bartenders do find the time to chit chat with each which is rather rude.
