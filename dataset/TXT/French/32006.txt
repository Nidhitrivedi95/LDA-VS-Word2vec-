gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA Great service, great food and an amazing view! 

I don't usually think the extra cost to eat at high-end restaurants for the ambiance is worth it (probably because I'm not rollin' in dough either! Lol) but this place is an exception. 

Right when you walk in, you're warmly greeted by staff and in awe of the decor. The view is as good as it gets in Vegas and the service here is very attentive and professional. The food was delicious. I would highly recommend the Bison T-Bone!

This is a great place to celebrate an anniversary, Valentines Day, bday, etc.
If you bring a date here, expect them to put out after! Lol!
