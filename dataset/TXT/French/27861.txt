dubu2kN3Y9EB4uYGFWa0MQ Came to primrose for breakfast before heading out on the road and had a wonderful experience. The quality of the food is delicious and the service is SPECTACULAR. 
It is a little more pricey then I would like to pay but you definitely get what you pay for. 
Our server was Leroy H and he definitely made the experience a lot more enjoyable. 
Very personable and takes pride in his job. Looking forward to our next visit.
