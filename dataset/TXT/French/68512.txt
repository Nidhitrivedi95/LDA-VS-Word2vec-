vLkKorA1gPS97Zj0_WKA0Q We have eaten here multiple times during different trips to Vegas and have never been disappointed. The food is always exceptionally well prepared, service is fantastic, and the ambiance is pleasant. The wait staff is very knowledgeable about the menu and the wine pairings they (or the sommelier) recommend have always been nothing short of perfect.
