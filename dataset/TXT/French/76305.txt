Food-wise this was a total miss for me. Started off great with the breathtaking atmosphere, iced coffee, and the complimentary pastries which were delicious, and went downhill very quickly. 

I ordered the eggs Benedict, with turkey bacon instead of real bacon. My order was brought out incorrectly the 1st time; they brought me some vegan dish with fake eggs and meat. Gross. They brought it back and then brought out the dish I actually ordered, and they forgot the sauce on the side. Waited for that to be brought out. Then I went to bite into my eggs, which were wayyyyy undercooked. It was literally jiggling all over-it looked like it was alive. Even more gross. I order eggs Benedict all of the time and have never seen eggs come out this undercooked. I advised the waitress and she was very apologetic and wanted to bring me something else. She said that's how the chef prepares the eggs, and that they could cook them through more for me. At this point, I was overly hungry and frustrated, so I chose to cancel my order and pick off of my husband's plate instead. His meal was also unenjoyable: he had the hash, which was basically like eating pure salt. He didn't like it either. Total bummer.

I would not visit here again for anything but a drink.
