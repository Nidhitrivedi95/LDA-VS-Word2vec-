q0n4I-zqiI47xispOqc1lA I used to come here wt my friends for brunch, it's been a while since I did my last stop. They changed a lot of things here.. they have crepes, French toasts, bagels and much more.. too many delicious options... the place is cozy, European and so nice to hang out.. one of the most beautiful back patio absolutely at Caffe Mona.. must see
