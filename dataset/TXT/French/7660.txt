4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I went here for a team function on one of the evening's of my company's sales conference.  The place was a little crowded and dim but it was a festive and enjoyable experience.

The waiter was great and definitely made the experience better.  We shared 6 bottles of wine, 5 appetizers, and 3 salads.  I am not a big fan of pate, but you definitely have to try it here.  The Mon Ami Shrimp Gabi wasn't quite as good as advertised, but I loved the scallops.

One of the special's of the day was Beef Wellington, and basically I made up my mind right there.  Half of the group did the same.  The dish was in a nice wine reduction mushroom sauce and sauteed spinach.  The crust was flakey and the beef was melt-in-your-mouth tender.

The price was a bit steep, but hey it's Vegas.  I don't particularly like the Paris hotel and casion, but I'd definitely come to Mon Ami Gabi again.
