SCklYa_jhihWAcfIn-_chg For what I've heard about this place, I was expecting a bit more. It wasn't bad in the least, and it was actually quite good. The chocolate croissant was fresh and buttery and super delicious. They serve Mighty Leaf tea which always shows me that a place cares about the tea they serve.

The smoked salmon eggs benedict were pretty decent. The bread that it was served on was not a good choice in the least. It was really hard to cut through. The knife was awful. Service was pretty slow and cold--it took forever to get a proper knife (which still didn't work). That was not the best choice of bread for the benny.

The salad dressing was good.

3 to 4 stars. Though it was good, I don't know if I'd return here for brunch. There are places I'd much rather go. If I'm around these parts in the early morning, the temptation of croissants would definitely lure me in though!
