9iy6scMRbs5ue41XRLGEkw I know this place has been around for a long time so when I stumbled on a Groupon we thought we'd give it a try.  We live in the Uptown area and have amazing bars/restaurants around so thought we'd be safe doing a brunch here.  We sat for 10 minutes before anyone asked if we wanted water or a drink and they didn't seem to be overly busy so it was puzzling to say the least.  We ordered the french onion soup which was just OK and for our meals we ordered the lobster salad croissant and the steak and eggs.  It took a long time to get our food, hubby liked his meal but when I took a bite of mine (lobster) it didn't taste right and I sent it back.  Overall the service wasn't great and 1 out of 2 meals was just OK therefore it's just not enough for me to return.
