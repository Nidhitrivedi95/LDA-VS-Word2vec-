COgwFthJpS4We16W5Gf4lw Wow! This place is a Vegas secret! Just off the strip. Amazing food and a very knowledgeable waiters/sommelier. We finally tried this place. Don't let the small looks fool you. The food is amazing!!! We had scallops cooked to perfection!! The Chilean Sea Bass and duck confit to die for!!  Finish with chocolate soufflé!! Don't miss this spot!!
