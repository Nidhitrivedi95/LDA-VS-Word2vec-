S50I4XsBmsWP1PNr_Q-StA Yes I went here well I had heard of the bloke that owns the resteraunt and I dont think I will ever get to eat in any of gordon ramsays resteraunts so here it was. Anyway I must say that this place is really really good its not expensive and it has lots of vegetarian food. Try a cheest tartlet very tasty my dad had the lamb which always keeps him happy and it was nicely cooked the food was presented very well and the staff were friendly but very fast. Great food and considering where you are a really great price
