rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Dessert for breakfast!!

I had the apple French toast this time around and it was delicious - a syrupy soaked tower,  bread pudding style, layered with baked apples and garnished with fresh slices of apple.  I wish I could've had a scoop of vanilla ice cream with it.

The winner is still the croque madame though - buttery, cheesy,topped with a perfectly done egg.

Really attentive service too - impeccable timing.
