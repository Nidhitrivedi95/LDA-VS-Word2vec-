or4UVDjXEEjze3wNPjoAZA Had a nice Cab last night at Zinc. Love the atmosphere, great service and great food. Flat iron steak salad...awesome. Really great signature drinks as well. The seafood sampler platter...wonderful as well as their cheese boards. Truffle fries...wow...they have won awards with their fries!! Also, a great place to lunch....they have an atrium room with brick and fountains that is open to the outdoors from above...quaint...you feel like you are in a small french bistro. I have been frequenting this restaurant for the last 4 years...regularly for lunch and dinner...not once have I had poor service or a meal I had to send back to the kitchen. :)
