rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A This place is awesome...might be my favorite restaurant in Vegas.  I had a seafood plateau with my friends, and ordered the beef brisket, which was the best dish off the menu according to the waiter.  The portions were perfect, and simply delicious.  

I wish it offers better wine by the glass.  The whites were decent, but the variety of reds were not enough for me.
