d4bVdEDwxmyB0M-w5vNNPg On a chilly Saturday, I found my way in here whilst waiting for a Christmas gift to be wrapped at another store.

Host greeted us warmly and let us sit at a table farthest away from the cold.  Special of the day were Oysters...awesome; Malpeque-like, but big and meaty.  With the house vinaigrette, they were perfect.

I opted for the Onion Soup with duck confit and Benedictin bleu croutons.  Not at all the taste I was expecting.  It was very light and delicate, but flavourful.  My wife had the mushroom crepes.  Outstanding.  Light and fluffy, but so full of flavour and were just the right amount of filling.

Two lovely wines went nicely with the light lunch - Jean Geiler Pinot Gris (available at the lick-bo) was buttery sweet.  The other was a Tawse Chard and much lighter, but a wonder accompaniment.

Small place with great photography for artwork.  Kinda pricey for a lunch ($70+), but great nonetheless.
