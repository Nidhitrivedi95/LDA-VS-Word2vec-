aW6Z4NSqEVli-xYMV3jRyg For spending $215 - even with a $40 coupon - I had hoped this review would be better. 

The fella and I went for dinner on a Saturday night, and everything started out great. The tables are a little close together, which makes it a smidgen uncomfortable if you're right next to another couple, but we went with it, and it seemed a little more lively than the one other time we went many years ago.

Our service started out awesome, and we got wine, appetizer (scallops, which were great), and the chicken entree (me) and trout special (fella). The trout came with a crab cake, which the fella said was absolutely disgusting... the trout was phenomenal, and he said he wished they'd had a bigger trout and no scallops. My chicken was pretty delicious though.

We ordered the dessert sampler, and when our waiter brought it out, he asked if we could just eat off that plate or if we wanted separate plates. I asked for separate plates, and we waited... and waited... and waited. Finally we just ate off the dessert plate. I don't mind that, but how do you offer plates and then never bring them?

It took another good 20 minutes for our original waiter to finally come by and bring the bill, which surprisingly had an automatic 18% gratuity added. I don't know if that's because we had a coupon or because they do it to everyone, but it left a bad taste in my mouth.

For the money we spent, I'd have much rather spent my night at Lumiere, Del Frisco's, Fig Tree, etc.
