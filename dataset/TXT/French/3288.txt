1cGyzWtfOoDiE8V0OR85yA Changed my perception of what crepes could be. I've had crepes before, at a lot of places, but never anywhere as good as here. The crepe itself was so delicate and the toppings, cheese and blueberry, were so fresh and delicious. I am used to them having chocolate, or Nutella, with whipped cream, which always felt like those flavors carried the crepe. But in this case, all the components worked together to make a delicious, delicate treat that I will be going back for.  
To top it off, I tried one of their chocolate croissant and that was so flaky, with great chocolate, and warm!
