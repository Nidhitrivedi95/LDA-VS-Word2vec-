YVYHX7RCPjCBqEth2CS91Q The worst dining experience in French dining. Poor service, skunky ice water, expensive prices and lack of attention to detail. Chipped plates, stale French bread. Tried it with a groupon and really wish I hadn't .  Great French food less than a mile away at Paris 66.  They make their own bread and pastries, reasonable prices and nice atmosphere.
