SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA I've eaten at L'Albatros twice. Once, when it first opened last December -- and just last week on May 1st. Both times were at lunch. I was very impressed with the lunch in December. Zach Bruel was the chef that day and everything tasted fantastic... unbelievable! I ordered the cassoulet and it was perfection. The duck confit, the sausages, the beans -- everything was delicious.
I'm sorry to say that last Friday's lunch was lacking. I wanted to order something different -- but I couldn't. I was so crazy about the cassoulet that I ordered it again. This time the duck was tasty -- but way more fatty that the first time. The sausages were not great and hardly cooked -- in fact, one of the sausages was a knockwurst, slightly warmed through. The beans were more like a "ladle full" of rather soupy, sweet baked beans. I never really tasted any garlic in the dish. My mother ordered the roasted scampi  on a bed of spaetzels. When her dish arrived, the scampi was placed on parsley buttered noodles -- no spaetzels. 
I have to say that Zach was not in the kitchen that day. Maybe it just depends on who is doing the actual cooking as to how dishes are sent out of the kitchen. I was kind of bummed. 
I love the carriage house space L'Albatros is in (I was a big That Place on Bellflower fan -- and was happy to learn that L'Albatros was going in there). I will go back again... someday. Maybe in another 6 months. I hope that my experience last week was just an "off" day for L'Albatros.
