jLxeBgWhLRbII2ACkgH1Sg Owner standing behind the cashier eating, and licking his fingers while cashier takes order. Owner then puts cup he already drank out of in the ice machine to scoop ice... I guess there was no ice scoop... it was weird how he was doing it in plain view... if the owner was doing this imagine the employees... and this is an "upscale" French bakery...
