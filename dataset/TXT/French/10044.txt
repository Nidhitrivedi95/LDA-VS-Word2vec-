4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw The atmosphere is beautiful in here- and this is why you should come.  Whomever designed this restaurant derserves a big kudos.  I love the lighting, the tile, and the glass ceiling by the patio.  I love how you can see the Bellagio fountains from the patio-so perfect, and how they remember to keep you warm here with their patio heaters. :)

  It loses a star because the food taste just "average" to me.  I've been here twice.  Once I got an apple salad that left me still hungry (I think it's meant of more of an appetizer than an entree), the other time I got the Classique steak (my husband and I share the appetizers of the mac&cheese, and sweet potato soup), everything was "just okay."  Big portions but ordinary tastes.  

The bread was amazing through, and bread is important to me!  The warm bagette with carrot dressing (sounds gross but trust me, it was fantastic).  I might try this place for breakfast sometime after reading the reviews here.
