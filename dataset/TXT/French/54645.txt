rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw Was extremely pleased with the service and quality of food at this restaurant. I was staying at the aria resort and casino for business and decided to try this place for dinner. Not disappointed one single bit. The waiter was fantastic and suggested a great beer prior to dinner. He was extremely knowledgable of the menu. I highly recommend this place.
