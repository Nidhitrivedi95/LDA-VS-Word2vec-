rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w We dropped by Le Cirque for drinks after going to "O."  It has a beautiful interior and as you leave the bustle of the casino it feels like you are transported miles to a place that is elegant and peaceful.

Their is a nice, small eight-seat semi-circular bar right near the front.  It makes up for its size with its splendor collection of Scotches, bourbons, and wines.

I started with a glass of cab while my friend had vodka with cranberry.  Both drinks were great.

The people next to us had a cheese plate and this dessert where chocolate sauce was poured over chocolate ice cream.  They loved both dishes.

My friend was then in the mood for fries.  They were not on the menu, but they made them for us anyway.  They were some of the best fries I ever had--really makes me wonder how good all of the other food is at Le Cirque.

This is a great place and I hope to have a full meal here soon.
