SBnpT6JDbah-5l_52GM5sw I've visited Sardine twice for Sunday brunch. I love the atmosphere and haven't had a miss on the food yet. The first time I was with a large group and we had reservations, were seated promptly, and my baked creamed eggs were heavenly.  I think about 4 of us in our group of 12 ordered the same thing, and one person had to send their dish back- it was way undercooked. The waitress remedied this as quickly as possible with a new dish.   

The second time, I had a group of 4 and no reservations. We waited about half an hour (arriving around 11:30), which seemed reasonable, especially since the day was so lovely! Lots of runners and bikers out, spring is arriving in Madison! I had the arugula, brie, crimini, scallion omelette. It was very very good, especially the bites that contained all the ingredients, and the frites are delightful.  One of my dining companions got the baked creamed eggs, and those were again the best dish on the table. Now I know not to stray next time!

I would like to visit Sardine for dinner and sample the rest of the menu, but for brunch, Sardine is a solid winner.
