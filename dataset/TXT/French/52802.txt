qCSyiWDbjks5OeWHlLqd7w Probably my favorite BYOB in Montreal. This restaurant is serious value for your money, the staff are very friendly and the tiny space creates a very cozy ambiance. If you're a vegetarian, it might not be worth it as the really specialty is the well prepared meat but they do always have veg-friendly options.
