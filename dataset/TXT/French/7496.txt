4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Meh!!  Some call it a great place. Others call it a must visit. I call it overpriced and standard. Five dollars for a very small plate of hashbrowns. If it was good though it would be worth it I'm all for that. But I think there's a brand by the name of simply potatoes that I found at a grocery store that was just as good

Listen I know you want to act cool, and be a tourist, any eat French cuisine.  Here's my recommendation-  take that same money that you have and find a better place. 

Service is great. That's not the issue. The food is just very very very basic. I don't care some famous chef put a little lime twist and a piece of rosemary with three tomatoes. That doesn't get me excited.
