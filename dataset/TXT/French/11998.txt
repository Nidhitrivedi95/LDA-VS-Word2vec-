4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw This is our second favorite place to have breakfast in LV after Bouchon.  It's always crowded, and everyone likes to sit outside with a view of the strip and Bellagio fountains across the street.  

The food was OK this past week, but definitely we've had better meals there.  Also the server seemed nervous, so he wasn't on his A-game.  Nice guy, just needs some experience.  

Best to stick with the French food imo.
