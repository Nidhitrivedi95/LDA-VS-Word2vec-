bzbNGyrTwWHAgg1CqkSgeg Subpar food...chicken and waffle, quiche...omelet and even simple eggs. Asked for over medium with sausage and fruit...they delivered runny eggs, bacon and no fruit.  The chicken and waffle was supposed to come with a side...I asked for grits and they never delivered.  We will not return.
