jT-KFrbwr5iE-_vrVLpmiw The open space concept of this place helped us to spend a lot of time with my friends to talk and enjoy our meal, which I really like about it... I tried the crab sandwich...it tastes good not great...its bread tastes so good but the sauce beside it was a little greasy and the lettuce inside the sandwich was not fresh...the pastries was great, it tastes nice and smooth...but I have a big problem with this place and it's about the pictures they advertised in their yelp! I couldn't find them in their menu which is awkward! Other than that it's not a bad place to spend your Sunday morning.
