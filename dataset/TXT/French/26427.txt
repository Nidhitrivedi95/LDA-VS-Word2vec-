D7CnTsm8SCmbQghz1ioPdw After failing miserably to get walk-in spots at Garde Manger right when they opened, we tried to locate L'Orignal in Montreal's Old Town, run by the same folks behind GM.  It was not that easy to locate, though it was our faults...  we stupid Americans thought we were looking for a place called L'OrigInal; not L'Orignal, after -- "the Moose" -- rather than "the thing that is quite different from everything else."  

Finally, thankfully, a hotel concierge in the area was able to (after much chagrin over our mispronounciation of "Orignal") point us in the right direction and we found it -- though it's also tucked away somewhat quite inconspicuously down a side-street...

Saturday night without reservations is tough everywhere, and they graciously fit us in only after the slightest hesitation - luckily, we were there early enough.  All in all, after all the excitement of getting turned down at Garde Manger, and wandering in a near fruitless search for option #2, we settled in.  And - while the service was charming and attentive, and the restaurant had a wonderfully chic but warm ambiance, the food was... just... ok.

We both shared a tuna tartare with home-made potato chips.  The tartare needed more acid; the potato chips crisp but overcooked and a little too browned.  The boy's peppercorn-crusted steak had nice flavour; the broccoli accompaniment was a surprisingly plebian ho-hum.  My coca-cola braised duck breast, though cooked a nice medium-rare, was just too sweet for my liking. 

By this time we had already been to Au Pied du Cochon and Toque! just the previous evening. And L'Orignal left just just a tad wanting...we'd be willing to go back and give it a chance, though... next time we're in Montreal.
