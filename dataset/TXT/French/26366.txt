D7CnTsm8SCmbQghz1ioPdw If you're looking for a white tablecloth fancy French restaurant, this is not your place. It has the ambiance of a loud Canadian lodge from the late 80's to early 90's and is located below street grade (read this as "basement"). The food and the service was good and interesting...although a little pricy.
