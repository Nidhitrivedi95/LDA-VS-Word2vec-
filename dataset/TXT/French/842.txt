_cjPEH9wXhKS-HQe_U3M4Q Went here for Sunday brunch a couple weeks ago. I enjoyed the food (goat cheese tart) but the service was a bit off- they took a long time to bring us milk for our tea, to the point where we asked multiple times. This bothered me as when we asked the 3rd time we mentioned that we all (4 of us) would like milk for our drinks and the waitress replied we would only need one creamer. Was very odd. I think the "A-OK" designation fits perfectly.
