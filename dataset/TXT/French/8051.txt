Holy effing cow was it delicious I nearly cried when it came to the last bite. Steak is definitely their specialty but not the only one, the seafood is also pretty amazing as proven by my boyfriend's sea bass daily special.

We started the meal with a small amusebouche, bread and butter, and the baked brie. The honey coupled with the roasted garlic made the brie a winner. Next came my steak, the best filet I've ever eaten, and it simply and perfectly came with Mon Ami Gabi's famous French fries. Being a French restaurant, we of course stayed for dessert and ordered the creme brûlée and a macchiato. 

For the quality and deliciousness of the food, friendly and attentive service, and atmosphere, this is one of the best deals and best kept secret on The Strip! The only reason I give it 4 stars is that it is a little cramped, and there aren't any restrooms inside the restaurant (my boyfriend and I felt people were walking on top of us the whole time, and you have to go outside into the casino's restroom if you have to go). Besides that, it is still my favorite place to eat and I am definitely coming back!
