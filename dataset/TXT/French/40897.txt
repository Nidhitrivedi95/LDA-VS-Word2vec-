kcF-en40P3J9L8nLy5lKqQ Alright first things first: The service is phenomenal. The hostess was sweet and looked back twice to make sure we were following her. The server was hilarious (her name was Julia?) and she was spot-on the entire time. I noticed another server who was meticulously polishing silverware, flattening out napkins and folding them perfectly, and carefully setting his table as if it were for his very own wedding banquet. I rarely see this kind of attention to detail.

The restaurant is extremely clean. I was also impressed when the servers come around with a tray of sliced limes, lemons and oranges for our water and iced tea. Very impressed!

The food is a bit of a letdown. The thin crust pizza was surprisingly flabby. I mean, isn't thin crust pizza supposed to be crispy? The chicken Parmesan was burned. Why oh why put a pile of arugula on it and leave the sauce on the side? Fail. 

I'll be back, I suppose, but there's dozens of other restaurants to try out lol

Come here for the service. Keep your expectations low on the food so that you won't be disappointed.
