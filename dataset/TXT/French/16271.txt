7s3xmQN9H9N404tQVXwoJQ Beware! All this place has is ambiance. Our waiter was horribly incompetent. He must have forgotten to put our order in because we didn't get our meal for over 2 hours - at 10 pm - and that was after we inquired about it. Then he brought the wrong meal for my sister - fried fish and French fries when she ordered baked mackeral and mashed potatoes. Then he tried to say that's what she ordered and told her they were out of the mashed potatoes. The meals we did get were uninspired and poorly seasoned. Very mediocre.  The only nice thing about this place was the terrace seating.  Though it hardly makes up for the horrible food and worse service.
