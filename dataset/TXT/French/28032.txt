DZkl5MleRKh0isxj1Y2Abg This was a really good dining experience, and a nice place to go for a special occasion.  Food was delicious, french classics but often with an interesting twist or different flavours. Apple tart is very good and fun to eat. Very tiny restaurant, which makes for a unique and intimate experience - neat to be so close to food preparation behind the counter, and to be in one single room with other patrons - but can also be distracting, as you're sitting very close to other tables. I held back one star mainly for the service, it was fine, but could have been more attentive, especially considering it is a small restaurant and is pretty pricey.
