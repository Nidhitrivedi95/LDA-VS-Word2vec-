4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I don't typically eat at places like Mon Ami Gabi, as my palette is not so refined. I consider myself a more simple and easy to pronounce food eater. However, my friends decided to take me here as part of a recent birthday brunch, and I am glad they did. The food was good, and our server super sweet and attentive. I will say this Mon Ami Gabi is pricey! But what isn't in Vegas. With that said, the portion sizes were good and we each left full. I went with a simple burger that I had them cover in grilled mushrooms; it was cooked very well. The fries are super shredded which is a bit weird for those of us who order fries and expect... well... a basic plate of fries, but as I said, I am a simple kinda gal. Oh and the most important treat, Mon Ami Gabi offers, a great view of the water show at the Bellagio directly across the street! So even though a bit fancy for my taste Moni Ami Gabia offers a good plate of food and very strong mimosas. I would say it is worth checking out. Happy Food Hunting!
