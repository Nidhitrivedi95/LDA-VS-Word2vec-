7Ym8NVxTO9b1FLGeWGp_Fg Terre Rouge is a beautiful restaurant conveniently located in downtown Markham.  It serves contemporary French cuisine which is hard to find in the area. 

I came here for lunch with a client and she really enjoyed the experience. From the hostess to our awesome server Andrew, to the manager and last but certainly not the least, the chef, everyone made us feel really welcomed. It was truly a 5 star service experience. 

In terms of the price, I thought it was very reasonable. We both ordered the lunch prix fixe menu for $22 which comes with 2 courses.  I ordered a salad and the black cod and it was delicious. The salad was simple but very refreshing with a creamy vinaigrette dressing, pickled red onions, roasted cherry tomatoes and a sprinkle of sun flower seeds.  I loved my cod on a bed of edamame beans and chickpeas.  It was juicy and uber flavourful.  The chef told us despite it looks like a simple dish, it's not. The cod was marinated for over a day while the vegetables are simmer in free range chicken broth. Healthy and delicious! My cup of tea. 

This is a great venue for client meetings and private functions as they do have a second floor with a projector screen.  Lastly, I would be remised if I didn't compliment our awesome server Andrew. He is super professional, attentive, and accommodative.  My client didn't realize her duck confit was served with fries, Andrew offered to change it to a salad for her.  She was very pleased.  When we asked for the directions to the ladies room, Andrew personally walked us up the stairs.  This is a gesture that is only seen at high end restaurants. 

I will definitely host my next client event here and bring my friends back.
