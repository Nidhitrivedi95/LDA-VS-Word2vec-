rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Came here for breakfast...the sourdough waffles are AMAZING. The beignets are also good, but I think the cinnamon sugar is on the sweet side (when paired with the Nutella and blackberry jam, it's a bit too much). We also ordered the eggs Benedict, which was perfectly poached. It was good...but the waffles are revelatory
