hvjgF-vnPw2jyL5DBuB0qg This place is amazing! The menu is always changing to go with what is in season and have great sea food dishes. 
The last time I went I started with the foie gras and braised veal cheeks on a waffle and it was topped with a little syrup. Melt in your mouth!!
Then I had the scallops with carrots and there was a few gnocchi too. The scallops were so sweet and plump. Another delight!! 
At this point we had no more place for dessert. But the last I was here I took the deep fried mars bar YUMM
The service is always amazing here, the staff know the dishes really well and have a great way describing it and how it would taste. 
It's a little on the pricy side but a definite guilty pleasure that needs to be indulge.
