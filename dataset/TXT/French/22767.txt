bzbNGyrTwWHAgg1CqkSgeg After hearing great things about this place my friends finally took me here and the food was delicious! 

My first impression of this place was the decor. The cafe has high ceilings and a upper level seating area. The ambiance is nice. As all brunch places if you're not there before 10:30-11am the wait time will be longer. We got there early and were seated immediately (side-note: you will not be seated unless your entire party is there). 

We ordered coffee's and lattes to drink. The coffee was so smooth and my friend who is picky about her cream choices was given a specially made latte to her liking. Now thats great customer service. 

For food: 
- Red Velvet waffle (as a starter... don't you judge us!)
- Kids 2 pancakes (with choice of meat) and side fruit and eggs
- sausage egg and cheeses biscuit with side of hash browns
- two quiche specials (chicken option) with side salads
- side order (1/2) of the biscuit n gravy

everyone loved their food. My sausage egg and cheese biscuit was HUGE! It was perfectly soft on the inside. Their sausage is hand made at the location (amazinggg). Kinda spicy but i like the heat.

My friends loved their quiches. The portions here are quite large and the food is filling for sure. 

the all-star of the experience however was their red velvet waffle with cream cheese drizzle and a huge strawberry on top. we spilt that as a group and man it was perfect!!!!!!!!!! 

good food, good service, good location!
