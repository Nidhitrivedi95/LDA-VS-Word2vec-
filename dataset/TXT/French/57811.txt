rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A If I was reviewing the food alone, Bouchon would be 5 stars hands down. But a big part of dining experience is the service, and that was bad. 

We had a group of 8, walked in a few minutes before our reservation, the hostess said our table is being setup right now and we'll be seated in 10 minutes. 30 minutes we finally got seated. 

The bread and toasted pistachios were delicious, but that's all we had to munch on for another good 20 minutes before the waiter came over and very rudely interrupted our table's conversation to read us the specials. Another 15 minutes to come back and take our orders. 

I ordered the daily special, braised short ribs with polenta, caramelized shallots, spinach, and shiitake mushroom fondue. By then I was famished, couldn't wait to eat my amazing meal, but after the rest of my table all got their dinners, mine still wasn't out. Short ribs already braised for 12hrs should have been the first thing on the plate! Nobody came to check if everything was ok, we had to flag down a waiter to let them know that we're missing a plate. The manager came by to apologize that the waiter forgot to put my order in, by the time I finally got my meal, the rest of my table's dinners were getting cold. These are the times when I would reduce the tip, a tip is purely for good service, but of course they have a "mandatory" 20% already added to the bill. 

While the food was good, I would probably never come back here again. Now that I think about it, haven't had a great experience with service at any French restaurant.
