4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw from what i remember, the food was pretty on point and i even ordered the escargot with a few adventurous friends. it didn't taste gamey or bad at all. the pesto that it was drenched in made it pretty tasty and chewy, like octopus or squid. ambience is nice and a nice spot for a big gathering or bday celebration.
