pmoIMK8zGWvKsVOPDBYfzg I treated my sister to dinner here. And yes, I am the queen of frugality, but I'll make an exception for Andre's (and i was armed with a $100 gift check from Open Table!)

To be honest, I am not a Vegas kind of person. I dont care for large scenes (even though I'm a NYC girl), I dont get wowed easily, flashy lights and a water show in a desert just annoy me rather than delight me. The constant cigarette smoke was getting on my nerves and I just needed to treat myself and get the heck out of Vegas and into my car to drive off to the mountains! 

What did I do to treat myself? I booked a table at Andres! We LOVED the private dining scene where the front of the restaurant is only some silly facade for you to get a drink at and the real dining is behind closed doors. 

There was only one other table dining with us that night and it looked like they were celebrating a quiet and fun wedding. Privacy means a lot to me. 

We ordered tons and tons of food. To be perfectly honest, the food is just alright. As I will repeat, I am a NYC snob, and my expectations for food are pretty darned high. With the exception of the snails, everything else wasnt very memorable. We also ordered the french onion soup, duck, french fries (which were those nasty french styled shoe string kinds... i like 'em thick!) and a few other plates that i cant remember for the life of me. Nothing was wrong or bad or yucky with anything that stands out as negative, however there wasnt terribly much that stood out as amazing, positive or show-stopping. 

Go for the amazing service. Go for the ambiance of luxury, seclusion, and peace!
