sphMzEIqY1I2Dzv3zLZY2g Global is a real find hidden among office buildings on the fringe of Ballantyne. I enjoyed dinner last night and hope to return soon. I ordered from their (held over) Queen's Feast menu and was very pleased with their braised Berkshire pork shoulder spring roll with an Asian cabbage, peanut slaw and sweet ginger soy sauce . Service was kind and attentive, food was unique, well seasoned and the portions were just right. Global is perfect for an intimate dinner, business meeting, or if you are on your own, a comfortable, relaxing environment.
