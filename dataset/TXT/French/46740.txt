nkHaix6KenApS8M-liZsCQ Wish this review could be about the food but I never had the chance to try it.   Came here yesterday for lunch with a couple coworkers and after we were sat none of the servers ever came to the table,  not even for a drink order.    After more than 20 minutes of us sitting their with our waters I saw a waiter drop something off near a table and said very politely excuse sir but we haven't seen our server and we have been here a while.    He said rudely that someone would be with us in a few minutes.   At that point we just got up and left.   No point in giving a place your business if they don't want it.
