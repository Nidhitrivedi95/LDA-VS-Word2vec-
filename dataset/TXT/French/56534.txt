rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Between Bouchon and Bouchon Bakery, I managed to have Bouchon at least 5 times in 1 week.

Buy the cookbook.

So many good things on the menu.  Bone marrow is a nice healthy, fatty portion.  I love the garlicky spinach.  And there was peanut butter ice cream.  YUM.

Lunch menu is also good.  And very generous portions.  I'd rather get Bouchon lunch to go at Venetian than get stuck with crappy Wolfgang Puck at the pool.

Macaroons are wonderful.  As are the bouchon bites (chocolate brownie things).
