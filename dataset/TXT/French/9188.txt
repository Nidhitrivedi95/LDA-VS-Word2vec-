4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw This was a wonderful treat.  I've been to France many times, and this place reminds me of that experience, but a whole lot closer.  The food was excellent and the waitress very knowledgeable about the food and its preparation.  I ordered the fish ($27) and my partner ordered the steak ($23).  They were prepared to perfection with each mouth watering bite.  I had some Pinot Noir with dinner.  After dinner we had the Frommage (cheese plate) with a baguette.  We followed that with espresso.  What a wonderful and relaxing meal.  We didn't feel rushed and we thought, for a little while, that we were back in France.  If I'd been in Vegas one more day, I'd been there again.
