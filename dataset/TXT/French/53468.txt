QlSpPzc4Oy05ic-PsoYH4g Stopped here for lunch just as it opened after reading an article about it in today's newspaper. You can sit anywhere. The owner showed me the artist motif around the restaurant which is very catchy. Even the tables have the names of various streets on them.

My waitress came and reviewed the menu with me. She told me that most of the dishes are small plates but if I wanted more then order a sandwich. I settled with the brick chicken  chlebicek (aka open faced) sandwich. It comes with fries coated with cheese.

I had to wait about 15 minutes for my meal but my waitress was attentive and made sure I had enough to drink during that time. The chicken comes with the skin on It is topped with a chicken liver mousse spread along with pickled onion and radish. It is served on a thick baguette. The chicken was mouthwatering good. Only difficulty I had was cutting it through the whole piece. Would have been easier with a sharp knife but my waitress suggested I just eat it by hand which I did.

The fries were good too and with the cheese added on top, absolutely filling. She then showed me a dessert menu but I was way too stuffed to try any of it. Will save that for next visit. I learned they had just opened after St Patrick's day so they are relatively new to the area. Prices are reasonable too for a descent size lunch.

Just remember that good things come to those who wait. So be patient. Good food coming your way!
