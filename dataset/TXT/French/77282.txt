YUFxSG6idHePsxOmnSHtpQ We were shocked at how good this place was.

Man... From the reviews, we had really low expectations. But I wanted cinnamon roll French toast and Coco's is an 18-mile drive from us, so we tried Mimi's. 

Eggs perfectly cooked. Delicious thin bacon, not thick and chewy like a lot of places. Cinnamon roll French toast and brioche French toast were both a knockout. We were seated quickly and served quickly. 

New favorite breakfast place.
