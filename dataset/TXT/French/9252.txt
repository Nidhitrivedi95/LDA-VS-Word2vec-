4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Mon Ami Gabi is by far one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas. I have eaten there at least 25 times over the years that it has been open.  It's great for a group of friends, a date or families.  It has one of the most unique views in town and a genuine French feel.  I am not familiar enough with French food to say whether it is authentic or not, but I can say that all the food is awesome.  Even the French bread that comes with every meal is great.  
The patio doesn't take reservations so if you are in a hurry ask for atrium seating otherwise the patio is worth the wait!
