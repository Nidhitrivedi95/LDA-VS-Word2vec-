YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g Stopped in for lunch yesterday. Called to get directions sine we were lost. Nice girl got us from where we were to Fleur. Was intent on a great lunch. But then the surprise. Closed for a while. "Doing work out back" says the receptionist sitting in a fully set dining room. So no meal for us.
