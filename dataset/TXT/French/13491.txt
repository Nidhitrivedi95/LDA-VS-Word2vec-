4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Mon Ami Gabi is a wonderful bistro/steak house located in the Paris hotel and we do not leave Vegas until we dine here. Sit outside and dine al fresco, you will have a wonderful view of the Bellagio fountains and it's fun to people watch. It's a bistro, you can dress casual and no one will judge you.

There is an excellent wine list, of course! The St. Aubyn pinot is lovely. The service is courteous and prompt to see to your needs and you will not feel at all rushed. There are great cocktails on the menu, I tend to go straight for the wine, though.

I like to start with the Onion Soup au Gratin, the 'french onion soup', you can taste so many layers of flavor and the cheese is melted on top, just starting to get that golden crust. YUM. I will have to make a point of trying other things on the menu, I can't seem to get past the Steak Bordelaise with it's lovely wine sauce and the soft, sweet, caramelized onions, or the filet mignon au poivre, always with frites, bien sur. Excellent steaks, I'm almost speechless...but not quite, there's still dessert! (And NO, I'm not sharing, get your own!).

The creme brulee is excruciatingly delicious, it hurts so bad...The bananas foster crepes are tender and delicious and absolutely decadent. The chocolate mousse is pure decadence!

I can't wait until our next trip, hopefully I can update this review...and add another dish to my list. Sigh...lovely...
