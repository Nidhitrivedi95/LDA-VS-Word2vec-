jalA5zHW8ZfY3RSPG7oDxQ SETTING:
Small establishment with inside seating by an open kitchen or seating in their quaint garden area in the back. Mostly for parties of two.

FOOD:  
Started with the spinach dip, which came with a warm french baguette. Never have I had a dip with such light and creamy consistency. I can't explain it, but I always get crazy shivers when I dip into something that is way too chunky...like mud, or, in this case, the spinach dip. Excellent texture and not overpowering in taste at all. Basically, give me anything edible and I'd happily dip it. Merci beaucoup.

For the entree, I ordered the salmon, and it was probably one of the best salmon I have ever had! On top of it being a healthy portion of salmon fillet, it was also very tender and flavorful. I'm not sure what was in the dollop of creamy sauce that came with the salmon, but it gave the dish an extra kick. The sides of rice and fresh greens were simple, yet a perfect accompaniment to round out the dish. It was so memorable that for that week whenever I thought about fish, I immediately pictured the salmon from Cafe Du Jour.  

SERVICE:
Patient and professional. Gave us enough space, but also came by to check up on us every now and then.  

IMPRESSIONS: 
I'm not sure I would categorize this place as French because it doesn't serve traditional French cuisine. No matter, Du Jour is mi amour and deserves high praise. Definitely sit in the garden area if possible. There's a water fountain/pond and greenery everywhere. Enjoying fantastic food in the "secret garden" just makes the dining experience even more special.
