rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I wish I could give 4 1/2 stars. The food here was amazing and deserves 5 stars. I really don't think you could go wrong ordering anything here -- everything we had was delicious and creative. 
The reason for the one star deduction is the service. While competent, our server had absolutely zero warmth. She knew nothing about wine, and didn't offer to ask the sommelier to answer our questions. She seemed stressed and unfriendly.
