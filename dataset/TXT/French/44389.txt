ME6D5nLlfG0xZCtICOYDuw I work in Piedmont Town Center and have been to every other place there.  I finally went to Georges for lunch and was pleasantly surprised.  Their special was a Quiche with Duck and Mushroom with a small side salad and lots of bread.  The service was top notch.  

My friend got the panini and he seemed very well pleased with it.  The prices are a bit high, but its an upscale place, so I can't fault them.
