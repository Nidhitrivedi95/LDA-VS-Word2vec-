-4TMQnQJW1yd6NqGRDvAeA I had high expectations and was left with a bitter taste in my mouth.  For my appetizer the fried chicken oysters tasted like flour and were over cooked.  They actually left a very bitter aftertaste.  The short rib was tough and I was not impressed with the olive and pickled yellow tomato combo.  The smoke mushrooms had a great smokiness but with a sweet sauce that was not to my liking.  The cauliflower side was okay, but I have had better.  My wife had the filet.  It was flavorless and not seasoned.  The pepper and corn that comes with it is just okay.  The dining experience itself is okay and the staff was good.  However the food did not live up to what I expect. I hope next time when I try different items it will be different.
