2wyAreH_GbzAOiigM7hXUA Zero star!! Terrible restaurant. No food on the trays on a Saturday! There was only one waiter who had to juggle between cutting the roast beef and collecting plates off the tables. We went in a tour group so we had made a reservation for dinner. After I lined up for the roast beef and looked around, there was nothing left on the food trays. There was rice and what looked like soy sauce in rice. Everyone waited for food to be refilled but they were super slow. The steamed fish was quite raw. The desserts table prob only had food for 10 ppl. We were 55 in total. The restaurant had no signs. It was in the underground level. It looked like a make shift location just for our tour group.
