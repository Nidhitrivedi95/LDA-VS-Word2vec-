ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug I travelled to Las Vegas from Phoenix as a birthday get together for my Mom. We arrived at the Paris, checked in and went to the Le Cafe ile St. Louis restaurant. We waited 20 minutes for a seat (no big deal) and were seated at a table in the corner by the loud and smelly casino. This is when it got bad...We waited over 40 minutes for our server to show up. We finally mentioned something to the manager and after that we had Alex show up at our table with a huge chip on his shoulder. We ordered and then sat there for another 50 minutes. We again mentioned our concern and at this time Alex brought us our food with a huff. Never did he refill our glasses, ask if everything was OK - nothing. We had to flag him down each time and the final straw was the fit he threw over us asking for 'to go' boxes. On leaving - I sought out the manager for the 3rd time and let him know what a horrible server Alex was and about the attitude we received from him. He told me that Alex was their "Employee of the Month"!! If that is what they consider noteworthy - I will never dine there again. 
Food is overpriced and nothing spectacular. Service is horrible!!
