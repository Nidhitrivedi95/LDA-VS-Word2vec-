rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Thomas Keller's more casual Las Vegas restaurant is one of my favorites when visiting the Sin City. Classic French cuisine that's been dialed back a notch, the meals are perfect as they aren't overly rich or filling. The Boudin Blanc is incredible. Also, check out Bouchon Bakery while in Vegas. Their French Macarons are to die for, especially the Salted Caramel variety.
