udFcIcbWbxrO8uLF95WnQg Another Zack Bruell Gem! I was disappointed my favorite Cleveland waiter, Phoenix, wasn't working the night I came in. My waiter Penny was friendly, informative and made the evening fun! The Manager, Nathan, came over to make sure everything was perfect and recommended a superb wine.
Of course the food was amazing, like the rest of Zack's restaurants. I highly recommend you give Cowell & Hubbard a try. You'll love it!
