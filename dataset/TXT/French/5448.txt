3jKUbhGSjFTv5jZ0wnW0xA I've been here 3-4 times before with friends and each time found the food a bit underwhelming. The portion sizes are extremely small for what you pay for, and I did not find the taste to make up for the small portions. 

The service, however, is very good and the setting of the restaurant is very cute and charming. If the food were more memorable, I would definitely recommend.
