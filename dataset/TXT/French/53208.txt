QeFsIMcIFIJcOrpthYL8jg We stumbled upon Modavie as we were looking for an affordable but classy restaurant for lunch.  We were SO happy we found this restaurant.  Our waitress was very friendly and we got quick and pleasant service.  We were visiting Montreal for a long weekend and got tips on fun nightclubs and events going on from our waitress.  The food was also VERY good and there was a lot of variety on the menu.  Just wish we could have come back to sample more!

Among the three of us, we sampled a wide variety.  For apps, we tried the salade mixte with goat cheese, which was light and very good!  We also had the rilette, a rich and filling, but not overly heavy, dish that we all really enjoyed.  The rilette came with bread and a side salad, so it was a nice mix.  We also tried the Toulouse sausage, again a hit - tasty and not too heavy for a summertime lunch.

Next, we had the soupe d'ognon, a French classic done to the T! It brought back memories of living in France - excellent execution!  

The smoked salmon and fresh cream with capers blinis were good, although the blinis themselves were a bit hard.  I would have preferred a bit of a softer pancake as this was a bit hard to cut through.  I didn't get the feeling that they were fresh (maybe frozen and then microwaved?)  However, the balance between the salmon and tasty fresh cream was just right!  A rich meal that made you feel like you were dining in style! :) 

Finally, the salade frisee avec lardons was also a success - the frisee had a light dressing, the bacon/lardon balanced out the lightness of the salad and it came with a hardboiled egg.  Again, reminder of a life of leisure in Paris :)

Try Modavie if you're on a budget, but still want to eat well.  We stuck with smaller plates and felt very satisfied with the quality and portions!  We'll be back the next time we return to Montreal!
