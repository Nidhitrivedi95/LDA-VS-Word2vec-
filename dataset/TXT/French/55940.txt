rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A For years I had heard that the breakfast at Bouchon was probably the best in town and only until last week did I give it a chance. Pretty much everything I had heard was correct. The food and service were great and I will definitely been back.

The French inspired cuisine was great. The location is the only potential flaw with the restaurant. It is tucked away in the Venezia Tower of the Venetian so it is a little work to get there. Once there, you do not feel like you are in Vegas as it is pretty quiet except for the bustle of the staff. 

We ordered a plate of the spiced beignets which are served with cherry jam and are outstanding. The are made to order and are perfectly coated in cinnamon and sugar.

For the main courses we ordered the french toast and croque madame. Both were very tasty. The french toast was prepared bread pudding style which was a little different, but still delicious.
