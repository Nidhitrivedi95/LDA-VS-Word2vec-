XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q Honestly, I'm not a fan of places like this.  Of course the food is going to be good.  It should be at the prices customers are being charged.  Is it insanely good?  Do my eyes roll to the back of my head when I take a bite?  The simple answer is no.  The reason is simple.  The food isn't unique.  It's good and very much like every other high end French restaurant I've been to.  

The formula goes like this:

- Lots of art, mirrors, white linen tablecloths, silverware changed every five minutes, 14 different people serving you, etc, etc
- Menu written in French with short English translations underneath.  Usually you haven't heard of either the preparation style or the ingredients
- Foie gras is always heavily involved (yes, I'm a sucker for anything foie gras related)
- Many courses
- Many very small courses
- Lots o' butter (albeit very good butter)
- The appetizers and the mains are very good (seared foie gras!,  white (because green is just too ordinary) asparagus with a tangy sauce, and four tiny bites of rib eye, which was very nicely aged, but it was missing that rib eye fat sizzle)
- Desserts are off the hook (the souffle, oh my!)

The only thing unique about Joel Robuchon's is the amazing sweetscart.  And by amazing, I'm talking forty different kinds of candied deliciousness!

So, yes, JR is a very nice place to go and eat.  They even cater to the celiac diseased among us.  But, the experience is ordinary high end and that was a disappointment.
