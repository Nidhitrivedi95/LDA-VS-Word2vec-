O66Zy8Y13VBm72ZDhS4fIg Horribly bad experience!!

I was part of the dinner party of 15 people for Summerlicious.  I won't go into all the gory details (just read down...there are at least 3 other reviews from people who I was with...yes, it was THAT BAD!!)
I will say that Sassafraz is a pretentious, over-rated restaurant with EXTREMELY poor service, mediocre food with arrogant stupid names that make boring meals sound exciting....until you see what arrives.
This was my first (and probably last) time out for a Summerlicious dinner.  I was always under the impression that the point of this city-wide event was to entice people who don't normally frequent these restaurants, to partake in their food and fare and hopefully return after Summerlicious is over.  I can honestly say that Sassafraz clearly missed that memo.  They had no shame in telling us (not in so many words) that they treat the Summerlicious crowd differently than their regular patrons.  I understand that this practice is probably not uncommon, but it doesn't make it acceptable. 
This experience has sadly tainted my impression of Sassafraz and any other establishment that feels it's ok to treat clientele like second class citizens.
