4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I came here for lunch on a lovely Friday afternoon. It's directly across from the Bellagio hotel.. if you sit in the patio area you might be lucky enough to catch the beautiful water show! not sure, if you would be able to hear the music though. Location wise, it's one of the best places to eat on the strip! It's smack in the middle of the strip.

Avoid sitting in the patio area in the summer time. It'll be too hot to eat in the scorching sun! Be sure to wear sunblock and sunglasses! :-)

The food was really tasty... the bread was so buttery! :) I ordered steak and fries! My friend ordered crepe/scallops/shrimp... it was so creamy and so delcious. My other friend ordered the open face BLT with avocado.. it was a little messy to eat... but it was delicious nonetheless.
