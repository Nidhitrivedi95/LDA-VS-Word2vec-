HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw Service was...well French, I guess. We got some French onion soup, and I got the flat iron steak. Steak was excellent, a good cut, no gristle, and cooked as ordered--mine medium-rare, a friend's medium. Soup was a little too strong and salty. The side of fries was gigantic. The fries were nothing special, sort of like McDonald's fries, and I wish I'd substituted them for something else., although my friend tried to substitute, which the server said was fine, then just brought an additional side as well as the fries and instead of substituting. Wines were pricy, but a big selection.
