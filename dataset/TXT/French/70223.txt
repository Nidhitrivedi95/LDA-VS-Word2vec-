Of course, it doesn't hurt that the scallops are buttery perfection (especially when paired with a spicy sharp chorizo, snappy Jerusalem artichoke chips and a verdant pea puree), or that the salads pair bittersweet grapefruit with tender watercress & crisp fennel in a clean, well balanced way, or that the tender forest mushrooms blanketed in breadcrumbs and a judicious amount of Parmesan benefit from a luxurious veal jus bath. 

Stay for dessert if you can. It's worth lingering over - especially for the classic rock soundtrack!
