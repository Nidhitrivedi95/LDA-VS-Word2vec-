3jKUbhGSjFTv5jZ0wnW0xA One of the few French restaurants open on a Monday. That said they were certainly not ready for a large group of tourists to show up! Food took forever, and the waiter did his best to accommodate us although he probably understood about 60% of my English. Can't argue with the quality of the food though. Everybody left happily satisfied with their meal despite the long wait times. Will hope to come back on a future visit!
