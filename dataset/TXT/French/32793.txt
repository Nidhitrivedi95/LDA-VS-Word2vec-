h_ypoQ2rmwX8UGSmohsGiQ Now, I've never been to France, but stepping into Maman is what I imagine it would be like to step into a cozy cafe in Provence. The decor is totally shabby chic with beautiful tile work, reclaimed wood, vintage furniture, and ceramic rabbits (everywhere!)

For the food, I've mostly come here for coffee and viennoiseries. The coffee is decent, but nothing to write home about. The almond croissant, on the other hand... Maman has quite possibly the best almond croissant I've had in Toronto - and I've had many. The pastry is the perfect balance of crisp, flaky, and tender and the almond creme is on point.

Not sure I'd come back for the coffee, but I'd definitely come back for the pastries =)
