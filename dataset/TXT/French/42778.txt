LjOBNcNNpuewBqSPxYYTJQ I have only visited the Amelie's NoDa location and this location in Pineville. Between the two I much rather visit the NoDa location. Even though they selection of food and coffee is pretty much the same, the atmosphere in Pineville feels more like a warehouse with lots of chairs set up. The Ambiance is not as  homie, warm, or comfortable as the NoDa location. I still may visit this location on occasion, but wouldn't necessarily recommend it to anyone.
