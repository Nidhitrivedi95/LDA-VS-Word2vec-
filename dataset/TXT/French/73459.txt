xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g We wanted to eat at Mon Ami Gabi for lunch but it's over an hr wait so we decided to give this place a try even I knew this place used to get only 3 stars. 

There's no wait at all around 12pm during Valentine's/President's weekend and been seated at the window seat right away..wondering why?? hmmm....Our waiter is very friendly, service is GOOD and the view is GREAT

We ordered the following plus 2 drinks
1) Cold Foie Gras Torchon 
    It was okay, nothing special
2) Lamb burger 
    It looks very delicious when the waitress bring out the dish, but the bun is very soggy due to all the sauces and juices
3) Beef tartare -- this is where it went wrong 
    When I first look at it, my first impression is.....the color of the raw meat looks a little funny. But I ate it anyways since the raw beef was over powered by all the spices they put in it, I couldn't really tell if the meat is bad at this point and I don't like wasting food.
I started having upset stomach after we left the place. I have very strong stomach so if I get sick, that means the food is reallllly not good 

Anyways, the bill come out to be $100 before tips. The food quality does not match their price point. For great view I would still go back to Mon Ami Gabi, for great food, there are alot more restaurants to choose from at the same price point or even pricier I would still think it's worth paying than coming here.
