m4PW-GMc8JOU5nmMYncu-Q My boyfriend and I had the best time at Le Lab with a French bartender named Nicholas. He went above and beyond to talk to us and provide us with restaurant and bar recommendations for our next few cities we were visiting. 

Beyond the amazing service from Nicholas, who seemed to really enjoy his job and our company, the drinks were fantastic. I had the Bi Bim Boom, with pink peppers, while my boyfriend had an interesting drink lit on fire with beef jerky in it. 

A really cool speak-easy atmosphere, featuring unique drinks, and fabulous service. A must visit! Thanks Nicholas!
