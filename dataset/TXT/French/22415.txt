Local Bistro offers up a little break from the routine. The place is ambient, walls lined with wine and a chalkboard of specials. I gotta love a place which serves up burrata as an app. Between the two of us, it was enough as an entree. But then came his black linguini w/seafood (aka squid ink pasta) and my arugula salad. The portions were HUGE! Not that I'm complaining, but since we were staying at a hotel, we couldn't really tote our leftovers. 

Between the two of us, it would've been easier to split an app and entree. 
Definitely get the Burrata app and Black Linguini pasta!
