rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A It was good, but shockingly not my Last Supper meal.

Let me start by saying that our waiter was the BEST!  He was attentive without being overly involved but always seemed to know what he needed.  He chose a wine for us and always chose our desserts.  What he chose was amazing.

Our appetizers were UNBELIEVEABLE.  The mussels were fan-freaking-tastic and we all agreed that we could have easily ordered three orders of the mussels and eaten them for dinner.  The pate was perfect.  

Dinner was odd.  My fiancee had three ideas of what he wanted -- our waiter told him he HAD to get the steak.  Steak??   We both looked quizzically at one another.  Steak??  And yes.  The steak was good but just a steak.  With fries.  No kidding.  Totally average meal.  I couldn't quite wrap my head around why anyone would tell you to order a *steak when there were other amazing foods on the menu.

I had the duck.  I love duck.  This duck was a little chewier than the norm but the mushrooms paired with the huckleberry were a beautiful match.  Our friends dinner were good, but I was pretty happy with mine.

Desserts were fabulous.  Worth checking out but now after reading these reviews, I would really love to check out the brunch.
