O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q We made our 2nd visit ever to Morels this weekend, and Morels solidified it's place in my top 5 LV Strip restaurants.  The weather was wonderful, so we perched on the patio, which is great for taking in the views and people, but elevated and set behind a fountain to protect your experience from the strip commotion.  The service was exceptional.

Quality is where Morels excels over many strip competitors.  Every item offered is consistently of the highest quality, and crafted with precision.   I love their massive cheese list, offering many cheeses from all over the world.  The cheese menu is well organized by cow, goat, and sheep milk; then it is sorted by texture.  The meat and rillette (pate) selection is considerably smaller, but all high quality items with detailed descriptions.  Next time I want to order the Scottish Salmon rillette.

The charcuterie presentation includes tags on each cheese with the name, description, and region.  We ordered the 3 cheese, 3 meat board, which also showed up with the most delicious honeycomb and fig preserves.  Our 3 cheeses:

1.  Mimolette Extra Vielle - Nord-Pas-de Calais, France (Firm Cow's milk) - salty and a little nutty, once banned by the FDA

2.  Valencay Pyramide - Loire Valley, France (Semi soft Goat's milk) - mellow and savory, one of Napoleon's favorite cheeses

3.  Idiazabel - Navarra/Basque, Spain (Firm Sheep's milk) - buttery, nutty, smokey; pairs well with salami and cured meats
