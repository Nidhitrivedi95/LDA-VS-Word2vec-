xcmmTXhuMx2fZF2Bt69F4w One of Pittsburgh's finest places. It's often way overcrowded on the weekends (Brunch-lovers beware/prepare in advance) so going here during weekdays is usually nicer if you can find the time. 

If you're in a group, get the LARGE moules frites in either the white wine shallot sauce or the red curry sauce. Never be shy to ask for more bread, the servers are incredibly helpful and kind :) 

LOVE the roasted tomato and spinach dip-- melted piave cheese is to die for. 
Charcuterie board is better for splitting between two people IMO, and if you're a mac & cheese lover you can't go wrong with theirs.
