YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g This place is WAY over priced for the portions of food they give you. I had the grilled skirt steak, $23 for a small plate of meat, my husband had the short rib plate at $30, again where's the beef?? $12 for a less than half glass of wine, good thing we had some comps from Mandalay or else we would have been really disappointed. I complained to the Manager about the wine pour and she said they serve 5oz pours  for happy hour also. Total rip off!! If I'm paying full price then I should get more wine!

Needless to say, we ended up eating another meal after our show that night!
