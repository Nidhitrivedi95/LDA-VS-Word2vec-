MhFoFpLBx_Fy8gs9dlwtGA I highly recommend this restaurant for a delicious French meal and enjoyable night out.  For my entree I ordered the smoked pork (porc fumée) and the inside of the meat was juicy and delicious.  The pork was served over pineapple chutney and was accompanied by coleslaw and some sweet potato slices that were somewhere between baked and fried.  Each Entree comes with soup or salad as well.  There was plenty of food!  The entrees (Or Les Plats) cost between $17 and $23, which seems more than reasonable for the quality of the food and the amount that you receive.

In terms of drinks, they only appeared to have wine by the bottle and there did not seem to be much selection in the way of beer.  They had a full bar, so I imagine they could make cocktails upon request.  The menu was completely in French, but our server spoke English quite well and was more than willing to help us.  The dining area has a nice ambiance and a classy feel.  

My experience here was quite enjoyable.  Definitely check out Au Petit Extra!
