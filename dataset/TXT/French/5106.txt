37kk0IW6jL7ZlxZF6k2QBg Came here in the dead heat of summer after a 3 week reservation with my other half. I've had this place marked for some time, specifically coming for their truffle menu. We were lucky to experience truffles in the summer months, as they were flown in from Australia. We ordered the extended 7 courses, which felt like a marathon to get through. Normally I'm up for the experience, but 4 hours was a little long... and after a bottle of wine and some cocktails, I was ready to Zzzz. I do want to mention that we received a cocktail on the house, which was was nice gesture. 

Food was well executed, and very seafood-centric. Ingredients were high quality and presented thoughtfully. Not sure why the largest plate (Whole hen served on hay) was served at the end though, I was pretty full by that point. 

Expect some smoke coming from your wallet -  but if you can fork over a handful of Benjamin's, everything is worth trying once!
