4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw To be clear this rating is based on Breakfast and Lunch, not dinner.

We had a pretty good breakfast here with all the ingredients appearing to be fresh and well cooked. The bread is just delicious and does remind you of genuine French baguettes which have such a unique taste and texture. 

Lunch was less than perfect. I chose Moules Marinieres which is one of my favorite lunch dishes (especially when served with real frites!). However Mon Ami Gabi fell short. The broth was way too creamy and while the mussels were decent you just couldn't get past the fact that a pretty basic dish had been executed poorly. The frites were also not great, they were in between chips and frites and that's not what you need when you order a classic item like MM. I imagine people who ordered Steak Frites on the bistro style lunch menu would be similarly disappointed.

Unlikely I would try dinner here with Bouchon and Daniel Boulud in town.
