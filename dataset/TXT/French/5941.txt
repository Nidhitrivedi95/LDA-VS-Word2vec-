3rj1qpgFvkRWtAka17mhEQ Had breakfast/lunch the other day. We enjoyed it very much. I had plain griddle cakes with eggs and sausage and hubby had chicken pot pie.
The wait staff was very good and at the end of the meal the manager or supervisor came over, thanked us for trying them and gave us 2huge muffins to take home with us. We will go back!
