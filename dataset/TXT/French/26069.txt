d482l58ho0_IMdFkXX1F5Q Girls weekend in Vegas and we decided to treat ourselves to a special dinner and chose DB Brasserie.  The restaurant is classic French brasserie, simple and classic with dark woods and dark leather banquette.  Service was attentive, efficient and extremely professional.  Our server Erik was so helpful and provided great recommendations.  I ordered the trio of champagne cocktails and really enjoyed the DB Paris the most, champagne with an x-rated passionfruit liqueur.  We ordered the lamb flatbread as a starter...so good...ground lamb delicately spiced with cumin and coriander and a perfect way to begin the meal.  My friend ordered the lobster ravioli special...generous serving of raviolis, plump with lobster...very tasty.  I ordered the duck confit: perfectly tender duck topped with super crispy duck skin and crispy wisps of onion rings served over braised Swiss Chard and trumpet mushrooms.  We also order the creamed spinach (who doesn't love creamed spinach?) and the pea fricassee, both great accompaniments to our mains.  To finish things off, we ordered the Black & White Fondant, a rich molten lava cake served with a refreshing verbena ice cream.  The food, the service and the restaurant were absolutely wonderful.  Looking forward to returning!
