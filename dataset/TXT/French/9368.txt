4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Delicious gluten free waffles made from scratch!  Excellent service even though the restaurant was packed on a Saturday morning.  Wonderful crafted juice drinks.  Pricey but worth it!  The crepes were also excellent my friends said.  No GF crepes but a very good GF dejection even GF Eggs Benedict.
