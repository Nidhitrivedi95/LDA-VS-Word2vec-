The beers (a duppel, a trippel, and a christmas ale) were great--good quality for an OK price (~$8 per beer).  The food was awesome.  We had the mussles w/the red curry sauce, the mediterranean platter, and the crab cakes.  The mussels and the mediterranean platter would have been enough for our group of four (considering we'd each had two beers waiting for the table).  This place is highly recommended--the drinks, food, and service are great.
