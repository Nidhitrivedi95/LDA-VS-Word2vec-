4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Very nice spicy bloody mary. The mix was very tomato based, but I love that. On to the food - the Eggs Benedict special was so buttery and the sauce so lemony that stomach still hurts hours later. I gave the bacon to my husband, who said it tasted like they poured maple syrup on it. The ratatouille that came with was surprisingly flavorless, and overall this place is just an average overpriced vegas breakfast. Maybe something else on the menu would have been better, but I won't be back to find out.
