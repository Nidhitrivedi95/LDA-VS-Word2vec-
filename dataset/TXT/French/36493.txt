i5vxtyiHKYnRcJ0p9N7mLw This place is amazing! Outstanding food, friendly people and great service. They really deserve all 5 stars. If you are in the south-east valley, you really must try it. I will definitely be back to this place again & again.While in line waiting to order, there were some nice fellows at a table closest to the register. I told my wife what looked good to me, and they overheard. One of them spoke up and said "I've had both this week, and they are both good". Then he offered me some bread & cheese and said "you gotta try this". It was amazing! I thanked him and ordered the Chicken Parm on crusty bread. It was fantastic, and HUGE! Their bread is delicious, and you can tell that they put a lot of love and pride in their dishes. The wife had butternut squash ravioli with butter sauce. I never really loved that dish until i tried hers. It was unbelievable!!
