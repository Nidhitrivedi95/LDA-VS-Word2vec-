ohMpNug5zWNxOlL6ShG7Ig Year another fantastic set of dishes from Cafe Bink. It's no wonder why we choose this place when returning to the Scottsdale area! 

Number one on the taste parade has to be the pulled mozzarella with the three sauces. THE greatest mozzarella I've had outside of LA. 

Coming in a close second with some of the greatest condiments were the best damn fries I've ever had. Truffle fries that held their own, remaining crispy long after I finished the sauces that came with them. 

While the wings were not as good as we thought, the fried oysters special and chorizo Mac and cheese were a great rebound that had my date and I devouring these dishes. 

Always a great treat to come here whenever we visit the area! 

Now for the chocolate chip cookies and crime brûlée
