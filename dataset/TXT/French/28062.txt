DZkl5MleRKh0isxj1Y2Abg Great restaurant tucked away in Yorkville. We had the lamb and ttoro as mains. Both were delicious, but the lamb was exceptional. Service was great and the atmosphere was intimate, with an open view to the chef's impressive work with what appeared to be an extremely small kitchen! We will definitely revisit.
