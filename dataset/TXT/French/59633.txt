The place was quite with soft music playing in the background and the retro vibe was really cool.  The waitress came by to get the orders and to serve them,  but somewhere along the way she disappeared and my girlfriend had to get up to find her for extra maple syrup (the serving with the French toast is very small). The portions aren't huge, but that's a healthy thing! Only the temperature of the eggs and the French toast was lukewarm at best, which is too bad. My Capuchino was good. No one came by to offer any refill for those who got filter coffee, no water were served and eventually we had to ask for it after we were done. Overall a solid 3 stars, nothing extreme. I may be back to try the burger, but probably not for breakfast.
