My husband and I both had the pre fixe menu with wine pairings. We selected different items for each course and we both tasted everything. I expected the food to be excellent, but this was more than just food. It was art. Of course, it was visually appealing--every plate designed with colors and shapes for maximum ocular impact. With every bite, I had the sense that someone's plan to surprise and delight was unfolding before me. And the wine pairings? Most superb I've ever experienced. Even with dishes I wouldn't normally have loved--the foie gras, for example--it was a bit sweet for me, but the luscious Hungarian Aszu revealed a depth of delicate aroma I couldn't get enough of. 

And throughout the meal we were continually surprised. First, with a yummy amuse bouche, and at the very end with a dainty little box of pastries. The next morning I savored the pastries over coffee and remembered the beautiful evening. After the dessert course, they presented us with the prettiest little tray of chocolates. I've never felt so spoiled. 

And where would you like to enjoy this splendid meal? Let's see, how about in a room filled with the bright, rich colors of a Picasso painting? Over the top flower arrangements and the Master's artwork on the walls. Oh yes, and the view? The famous dancing waters of Bellagio's fountains outside the window. 

Memories are better than things. Things can disappear in an instant through theft or disaster or carelessness, but memories are forever. I'll always treasure our dinner at Picasso--a delicious, perfect evening. xoxo
