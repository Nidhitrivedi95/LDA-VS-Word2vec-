The place itself is beautiful. Definitely somewhere I would want to take my mom for mothers day. Parisian style decor, very elegant. 

The wait staff is outstanding. The starts I gave were for the service. Excellent is an understatement. My water glass and cup of coffee was never empty and they would always come around when I was done with my plate. I love their uniforms as well. 

Now I come to the food. Although there is a lot of quantity, the quality is not present. My spouse and our friends all agreed that there was a lack of flavor in the food. The presentation of the buffet was beautiful though!  

There is a warm station where there was waffles, fried chicken, pancakes, french toast (this was my fave), sausage, bacon and bread pudding. The carving station had turkey, some salmon something that was incredibly bland and some various breads. There was an omelet and egg station where they would take your order, cook your requested item and bring it to your table. However, my husband said it wasn't good. Then there is a salad station, sandwiches (unlabeled! these things should be labeled for allergies, etc.) and then fruit and dessert. The creme puffs were pretty good. 

Everyone in our party agreed that the $54/pp was not worth the price AT ALL. 

I wanted to love this place so much, I really did! We booked the reservation 3 weeks in advance so perhaps we built up unrealistic expectations of the place.
