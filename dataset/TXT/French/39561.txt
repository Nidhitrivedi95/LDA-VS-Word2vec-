JvEu_1sJod6DGbYOatFvMQ I have to preface this by saying I went here years and years ago, and want to go back to see if the quality has held.  A colleague and I were in Montreal for a conference, and I heard the concierge tell a hotel guest about it.  The lobster, mango and avocado salad was excellent, and we chose to go back for three consecutive nights until we had to leave town, and, sadly, Restaurant Julien.
