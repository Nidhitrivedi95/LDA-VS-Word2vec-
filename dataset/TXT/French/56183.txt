I can't believe how incredibly bad this place was. I wish I could rate this place zero stars.  I was there as part of a group of 11 and have never experienced service this bad at a restaurant so highly rated. I clearly got the sense that the waiter (Corey J) knew that his 20% tip for large parties was in the bag and just didn't give a damn.

Details that a restaurant like this shouldn't miss often were: not clearing bread crumbs before setting down appetizers, leaving water glasses empty, etc. The waiter would disappear for large periods at a time. He often didn't know who ordered what.

The food was also lackluster. Although my mushroom soup was fine, the steak I ordered was prepared with a shallot sauce that wasn't listed on the menu. When I complained to the waiter he said that he was "fairly certain" he described the preparation to me because he usually does. He later brought out a replacement that was bloody red, not the medium I had ordered. I ended up paying $35 for a steak I barely touched.

I also tried some of my friend's gnocchi and it was extremely sweet. Around the table, the best anyone rated for food quality was "OK". 

The place had a lot of promise - nice atmosphere, I liked how the menus were presented.
