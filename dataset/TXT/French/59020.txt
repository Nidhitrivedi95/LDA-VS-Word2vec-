rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w Best meal of my life, hands down.

With exceptional food, such as this, I expect a long dinner - 3 hours, in fact.  This was perfect - the service was not slow, they were silently attentive, only interuppting the conversation for the next course.  The staff was amazing... the food - wow.  I didn't think I'd like escargot - I was wrong.  It was rich, flavorful and decadent.  The fois gras - amazingly sweet in one dish, and savory on a steak.  If you love chocolate - get the chocolate sphere for dessert... 

Just absolutely gorgeous interior, views and experience.
