VmSkQsAjUtzJeliKeGQCOQ Loved this little bistro!
We were looking for a good place to eat brunch in Stouffville and accidentally came here and we are so happy we did.
It is Saturday and they have a special brunch menu which is to die for. French toast special was great, the eggs special delicious and so was the salmon omelette with goat cheese.
The plates are big, lots of fruit, bacon was thick and crispy and the sausages were great too.
I give these guys 2 big thumbs up.
