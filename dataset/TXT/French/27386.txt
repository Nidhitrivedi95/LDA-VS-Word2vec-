dgiJTIKS1QYTW2gFyK2X7A I went with my Foodie Group and Enjoyed the Atmosphere, the service and the food very good and different ( with a nice little twist).  The only thing I was disappointed in was that the owner threatened to give the table, a table of strangers ONE bill if we were more than 8 people.  We, as a group have done many restaurants and thus I was shocked when he proposed this.  I would have had to restrict everyone's intake because I would be forced to collect cash from everyone to pay my ONE bill.  As it turned out we were only 7 and the owner is the one that lost out because Half the restaurant WAS Empty when with my group, if I hadn't restricted us, we would have nicely filled it up for them.  All in all I do recommend this place but not for groups more than 8, unfortunately!! 
BTW  The bread they served with their meals was Amazing and so Fresh! Came from their bakery next door. Nice touch!
