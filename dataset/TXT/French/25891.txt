Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA Terrible service.  The service was so bad that it ruined the whole meal.  In addition, my filet mignon was chewy and the wine was spoiled.  The service was so horrible that I actually complained to the manager, which is very rare for me.  He did compensate us for the complaints and went out of our way to make the evening better for us but I will not be returning to eat. 

As everyone else says, the view is spectacular.  Absolutely gorgeous.  I will likely vist the bar again but I won't be eating at Mix again. OH! Check out the restrooms in the bar...makes me chuckle that the best views are from the bathroom. :)
