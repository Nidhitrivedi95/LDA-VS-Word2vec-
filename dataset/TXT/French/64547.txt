Tefx_N6A6nrsdj4jHHnbYg Stopped by for breakfast for the first time before visiting my brother at Southern Hills Hospital. Had the cinnamon & sugar crepe and French press coffee while my daughter had the croque monsieur. Food was tasty but portions were smaller than expected. Also bought some pastries to go and highly recommend the almond croissant. My only complaint is that they charge extra for creamer with my coffee which I think should have been mentioned before ringing up. Otherwise, just include it with the price of the coffee so people won't feel like they're being nickel and dimed. Asked for a to- go cup for my coffee since it was good for a few servings but left the cup on my table by accident. Went right back after 15 minutes and the staff had tossed it out. They didn't even offer to replace it with regular brewed coffee since I went back for it. It's the little things that will earn repeat business from customers.
