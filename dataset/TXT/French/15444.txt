6fPQJq4f_yiq1NHn0fd11Q Damn it all to hell! If Richard Z or Dallas G beat me to one more review I am going to hurl myself from atop the Luxor obelisk, which by the way, Richard can't tell if it is here nor there. But I digress. 

I was introduced to this little crepe place oh so many years ago by either Dallas or Richard and have been in love ever since. My staple was the Normandy, warm apples, caramel, and the ton of whipped cream everyone talks about. I was happy with this, content you could say. I have strayed in the past, trying a savory as opposed to sweet crepe, but it just wasn't the same. 

This most recent trip to Sin City I was messaged by Mr Z and told about a new delectable crepe being offered: The Peanut Butter and Banana crepe. Anyone who knows me, knows my love affair with peanut butter is a long and satisfying one. Bananas are a new love and I recently discovered that the two combined are an unstoppable force.  Throw in a thin, chewy crepe, and some of the whipped cream and you have yourself... well just look at the picture.

The line for this place can seem like an eternity, but the people watching is entertaining.  Any trip to Vegas seems incomplete when we are just unable to fit Le Creperie into the mix.
