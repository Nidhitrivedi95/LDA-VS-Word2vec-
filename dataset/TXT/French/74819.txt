xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g During my short stay in vegas I was taken here. Knowing nothing about vegas I found it entertaining from even standing outside the building.  Total paris themed it puts you right in the mood to a nice dinner overlooking the strip.  
Nice selection of drinks, and extremely polite staff.  Was seated right next to the window with an extremely wonderful view that I will never forget.  For my main I ordered the lamb.  I love my lamb super rare and they cooked it perfectly.  
Even though I associate this restaurant with touristy things to do while in Vegas it is surly a place that Ill never forget and I def. reccomend it to anyone that is in vegas for a special time if your willing to splurge a little from your earnings at the casino .
