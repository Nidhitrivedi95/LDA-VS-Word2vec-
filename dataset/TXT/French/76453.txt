Yp9w4nhUowBU_IS_StFXbQ We ate here just a few days ago for brunch. It's pricey, but so is everything else in Vegas. I got the Duck Confit Hash and Eggs. Having just traveled to France recently I had high expectations. It wasn't great. If I returned, I would not order the same thing. I was hoping for more. My boyfriend got the Tableau breakfast. It was $28, came with assorted breakfast pastries (a whole basket), eggs, sausage, toast, coffee and juice. By far the most bang for your buck on the menu. He really enjoyed it and was kind enough to share his pastries. He definitely made the right choice. The staff were very friendly and attentive. Overall, good experience, but I hoped for more.
