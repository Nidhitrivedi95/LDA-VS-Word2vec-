m4PW-GMc8JOU5nmMYncu-Q We decided to check this bar out after seeing it on a few lists of must see places in Montreal when we were in town for a long weekend. Looked questionable from the outside but once inside it was awesome! I've never see such a variety of booze and mixing concoctions, the cocktail list is EXTENSIVE, expect to ask the bartenders (who were super friendly) for recommendations.  We happened to stroll in during happy hour (which goes until 8PM and a selection of drinks were $8 vs the usual $14+). My husband and I both had 2 of the La Citadelle - awesome and spicy!  I saw someone get the jack daniel's beef jerky drink that looked amazing and involved fire. Very very cool spot, def. a must visit.  We were raving about the cocktails the whole weekend.  No food though (unless you count the beef jerky).
