The food was delicious but there is most certainly room for improvement. Here is what my table of 3 ordered for dinner on a Saturday night:

Bellini
-highly recommend that you try one of these! It is a more traditional version (not your cheesy frozen cocktail served in a fishbowl sized glass like you get at your local big chain restaurant). It was elegant, refreshing and tasty but at $15 each, you may want to pace yourself.

Charcuterie 
-this was good but it could have been better as all the vegetable accompaniments were pickled (beans, beets onions)...it just needed a bit of variety and maybe a spread of mustard and/or compote to go with the meat and cheese
-buffalo meat was part of the selection and although I appreciated the unique offering, it really did not have much flavour.

Bread Service
-I mention this because if you would want bread at the table it is $2.50 per person which I totally disagree with. Serving bread to your customers, is a cost of doing business and charging for it doesn't really start the meal on a positive note especially when menu prices are already on the higher end...it feels like the restaurant is nickle and dimming their guests
-bread service comes with olives and flavoured butter. It was tasty but the butter came out almost frozen so it really didn't spread well on the fresh bread

Mixed Green Salad
-my friend said it was fresh and crisp and nice light way to start the meal

Venison with Gnocchi 
-tasted great...gnocchi was some of the best I have had

Cornish Hen
-delicious and creatively prepared and presented (I think it came two ways)

Duck Breast
-it was the best plate at the table (it was my order)! It was fabulous and I would go back just for this plate

Grapefruit Cheesecake
-my two friends really liked it. It wasn't so much to my taste as it wasn't as "fruity" as I had hoped but the ice cream it came with was flat out amazing

The portion sizes were what one would expect from a higher end dining room. Not too large but not itty-bitty. The presentation of each plate was lovely and thoughtful ...sorry I did not include pictures.

The meal ended with the server bringing out 3 chocolate truffles which I thought was a lovely touch. However, like the butter, they were almost frozen which I am sure is not how they are meant to be served. They also did not have much flavour or richness that I expected. They were a bit bland. 

The service for the most part was good although I should mention there were only 3 other tables (all deuces) in the restaurant. It did irk me slightly that our water glasses went near empty three times and had to ask for top ups.

I think with a some finesse and improving on a few small things, 25 Liberty can really make a mark in the Toronto food scene.
