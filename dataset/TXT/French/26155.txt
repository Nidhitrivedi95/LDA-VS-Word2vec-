d482l58ho0_IMdFkXX1F5Q Great $9.99 burger and fry special (minus the $2 upcharge for cheese).  Unfortunately, we were in a time crunch and the host assured us that we could be in and out in 20 minutes.  Our food did not arrive until our needed leave time, leaving us little time to enjoy our food while causing us to be late to our seminar.   The fries, however, were to die for.  We would definitely come back when not on a schedule.
