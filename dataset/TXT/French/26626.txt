D87tFO-R6U8f4-e0r4Zq_g A cute shop at the corner of Yorkville and Yonge St bringing a taste of Paris to our fine City.

Ordered the Rive Droite (translated as 'Right Bank'  which is a geo reference to the Northern part of Paris) 

contents of crepe:
scrambled egg, sour cream, baby spinach, & smoked salmon

I didn't  feel a warm 'love is in the air' kind of service. Service was all business but was spot on.

The crepe was perfectly made and the taste combination was superb!

It was warm to the touch, made to a slight crisp. It is to be eaten in your hands like a sandwich (wrapped in a brown paper bag)

I visited during a quiet time just before noon on a weekday. 

Definite recommend - to dine in or take-out.
