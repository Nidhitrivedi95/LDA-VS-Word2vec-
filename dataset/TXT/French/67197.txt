USleI8g1UVN9-9jm-b4uIg What an excellent meal we had at the Fig Tree. From the food to the drinks to the service. Everything was top notch. 

It was date night and our dinner helped it along towards perfect evening status. We started with the seared foie gras which was served atop an almond bread puddingish delight and drizzled with a blueberry gastrique. Just lovely. 

She had a scallop app and I had the double cut elk chop in a gorganzola cream for dinner and both were fab. 

Service was on point throughout the evening and they arranged for a cab to get us to our next destination. All in all, highly recommended!
