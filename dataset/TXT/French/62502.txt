SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ I almost gave HOT three stars, and the only reason why I didn't is because I had a better dining experience last night than I had the previous few times I have eaten at HOT.  I want to be clear and say that the only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the food really is very good... and that's basically the point of eating at a restaurant, right?  And the service was amazing.  Our server was friendly, helpful, and attentive.  And I really do love the ambiance.  (Great date spot!)

My main issue with HOT is the price of the food, especially because the portions are quite small.

Here is what we ordered and how my friend and I felt about it:
1. The "Bloody Mary" Salad, which is tomatoes and a lot of other fresh goodies.  Delicious.
2. The seared scallops over cauliflower puree.  The scallops were good, but there were only 2 of them, and they weren't that large.  Also-- and this may be a personal preference-- but the cauliflower puree was very smooth, but such a viscous and thick texture that I wasn't a fan of it.  Also, I truly love cauliflower, and it tasted nothing like cauliflower.
3.  The mussels (which is one of HOT's signature dishes).  They are technically a starter, but I ordered them as my main course.  Honestly, I did not love them.  They were a little cold, which does no favors for mussels' texture.  Also, I don't like a creamy sauce for them-- I would rather something more wine or stock-based.  (Again, this is a matter of personal opinion, but I don't think mussels should be in something creamy.)  The flavor was good, but not great.
4..  The beef tenderloin with butter whipped potatoes and bacon demi-glace.  We ordered it medium-rare and it was PERFECT.  One of the best bites of meat I have ever had.

Basically, I feel that HOT is hit-or-miss... and that would be okay, if it weren't for the price.
