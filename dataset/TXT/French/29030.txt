EPb3FWs3mxQLUjGeMNP0SQ Made a reservation at Suite 701 for brunch while visiting Montreal for a Bachelorette Party. We came here primarily for the bottomless drink option - $30 for unlimited drinks for 2hrs with the purchase of an entree. The restaurant itself is really well decorated and spacious. The service was fine and the food was very good. As tourists, it was also a great spot in that the Basilica is right across the street and the Old Port pier is a short walk away.
