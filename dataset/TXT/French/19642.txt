They had the most delicious-looking case of food. Anything from grilled cheese, to beautifully made cheese danishes that almost look like cupcakes with cheese filling. 

A variety of coffees, and tea to suit any pallet. 

They had a window if you did not want to go inside. A food order could be placed from outside. They had a large sitting area for eating and enjoying the outside. 

Definitely recommend!
