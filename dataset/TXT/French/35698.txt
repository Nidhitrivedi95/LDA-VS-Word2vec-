htQgj-ANQpZGpIpkkrEmyQ Visited for the first time today for an early lunch. Place was empty at 11:30 on Sat but quickly filled up by noon.

Food was DELISH!! I can't decide which of the items my friend and I ordered would be my favorite - Soft shell crab pakora, butter chicken serpentine and banana bread French toast with coconut and vanilla. Can't wait to go back and try their dinner menu.
