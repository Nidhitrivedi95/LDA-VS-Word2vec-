eJ9L40jm5VOXCIq7xs9kQw Loved this place! Came to Montreal for a visit and tried a bunch of places in my short stay but this is by far my favorite. The ambiance is romantic but not too quiet. The food is delicious. A little pricy but not too bad when converted to American dollars. I got the lobster bisque which is AMAZING! And the duck as my main course and it was FANTASTIC. My friends loved their onion soups and the goat cheese appetizer (which I tried and I conquer!). The dessert is good. I'd definitely skip the soufflé it was way too eggy. But then again I was never a fan of soufflé. The cheese cake and chocolate cake were delicious though. I highly recommend this place.
