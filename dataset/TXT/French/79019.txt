ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug I would go back. One of the current (2/09) special items (after 5pm) is fillet mignon medallions. Very tasty and worth the $12.95. Better if you're using your comps! The grilled chicken sandwich comes with two good-sized breasts on the bun. Bring a zip-lock bag and take the second one home for a snack later on. Save some of the table bread, and make it a late-night meal back in your room! (Yes, I am rather cheap!)
