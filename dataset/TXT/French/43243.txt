lQ9VmIWvM6v-rONPkYX8aQ I heart Alex! 

A good dinning experience should be the good food + the good mood.  I enjoyed both of them in Alex. 

Alex really serves delicate food,  my bf and I tried both of their tasting menus, one menu has more courses than another. We had red wine, too. 

This place is very pricey, around $400 for two(can't remember exactly), but worth it. Plus, they are friendly and caring enough to surprise you with special anniversary dessert, as sweet as the cookie bag they give the customers before leave. The cookies are a little bit too sweet.

Uploaded some photos.

Oobtw, they do charge in advance while you making reservation. So have the credit card ready.
