The food on the other hand was so so .But then again, I got their onion soup, and perhaps I should have gone with something else, but my throat wasn't feeling so good so I decided to get something warm. The cheese was all clumped together as one huge chunk, and there was a large piece of bread stuffed inside the soup that was soggy. The soup itself tasted just ok, but slightly salty for my taste. The brie cheese with chestnuts was delicious, and I would definitely recommend it. 

However, I'm willing to come back to try more food from the menu, and you really can't beat the scenic view.
