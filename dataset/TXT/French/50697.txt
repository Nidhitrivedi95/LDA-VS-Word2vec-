OZC42gnhlJ_auXduDRfMoQ I live in the neighborhood & couldn't wait for Scratch to open.  Decor is trés chic.  I would give my rating four stars but the service needs some extra training (server should know what a béchamel sauce 
is if working in a French restaurant) & a bit more personality & interest. Food is served promptly but it's the initial service that's the first impression.  I love living downtown & happy to see more businesses popping up. I want them to be successful. I will be back though. I'm not ready to give up.
