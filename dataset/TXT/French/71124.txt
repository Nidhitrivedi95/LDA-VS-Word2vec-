xcmmTXhuMx2fZF2Bt69F4w I wish i could have gone to this place earlier. Has very decent food (I tried their carbonnade Flamande and it was awesome!)
The surroundings are also pretty nice, Melon Park is like 5min away which means you could take a walk in the park after you've stuffed yourself with too much food too!
The only complaint was that there were way too many people ( Cuz it's popular), so you've got to be patient to get your seat :)
