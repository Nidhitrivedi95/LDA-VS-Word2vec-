The second time, unfortunately, was a bit more of a miss. The poor waitress who was left to serve the entire restaurant - packed even on a weekday with hip families, morning-afters, and classy ladies (oh yeah, that was us) - was running around the entire time. But undoubtedly, one gal can only do so much. The odd thing was forgotten and we had to regularly ask for refills on water and coffee. Things were a little slow in the kitchen as well, as we waited just long enough to notice that we were, well, waiting just long enough. Luckily, the atmosphere of the place and the company were charming enough to keep our 'tudes at bay. 

The food is good, and something that I love about La Gaffe is that their whopping sides of salad are a welcome alternative to more greasy goodness. Eggs are done just right, and their fancy sausages definitely hit the spot. I would see myself coming back here to give 'em another shot, but a word to the manager - please be sure you have more staff on hand when it comes to morning brunch times!
