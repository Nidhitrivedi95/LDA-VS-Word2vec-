QeFsIMcIFIJcOrpthYL8jg I cant say enough good things. Our waitress was absolutely lovely - attentive and sweet without being overbearing. The soup of the day, cream of broccoli, was divine, and definitely called for on the snowy cold evening. I had a duck breast - perfectly cooked, with excellent sides. I subbed risotto (personal preference), and it was perfect. Excellent portion sizes as well. My mom had the chicken supreme and loved it, and she's very picky. All in all, a wonderful atmosphere and experience for our last night in town! Definitely a must. Pro tip: make a reservation, well in advance.
