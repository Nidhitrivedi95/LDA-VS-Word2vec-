S5gtq6g6dIfyaFvyPYyzkg After a decade of living in Edinburgh I can't believe I've managed to miss out on going to The Dome. It seemed like a fitting venue for a post-art gallery wine tasting session and positively took my breath away. 

From the minute you walk into The Dome opulence abounds. From polished tables, mosaic floors, marble pillars, sparkling chandeliers, extremely well dressed staff and that absolutely stunning domed roof...I felt like I was on a 1920's movie set! 

There was no trouble getting a table on a Thursday, and the table service was efficient and attentive. The drinks were a bit more expensive than normal (£9 for two G &T's) but for the surroundings it didn't seem to matter! A plate of nachos to share was £10 but between us that wasn't much and they were delicious...and didn't last long! I've also been reliably informed that a stop here for an afternoon pot of coffee, with shortbread on the side, is a cheaper and more luxurious alternative to the more generic coffee shops!. 

So, after a very enjoyable evening, we reluctantly dragged ourselves away to catch the last bus (no Bentleys with a chauffeur to take us home unfortunately!) looking forward to the time when we can get all dressed up in our finest to make a return visit!
