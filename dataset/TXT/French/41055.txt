kcF-en40P3J9L8nLy5lKqQ I have only had a couple of drinks at the bar - an AMAZING bar. Dining from what I could tell looked interesting. Very modern and the menu looked inviting.
Only issue is that you would be inclined to drive by it. Exterior finishing is best described as " Nouveau Waffle House or Renegade Dennys. Horrible. If the owner had put a tenth of the effort into the exterior look/feel as they inside the place, they might actually get the casual drive bys to stop in. Otherwise in driving by it is best ignored. Too bad really in this era of new independent restaurants.
Will try the food next time and update the review.
