rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Delicious and decadent. There are so many options in Las Vegas it is hard to choose a breakfast spot. Lucky that my boyfriend and I were staying at the Venetian. I know about Thomas Keller and dream about going to the French Laundry. I chose the Croque Madame and asked for a salad instead of the potatoes. The 2 balanced out for me nicely since the sandwich was so rich, buttery, and cheesy. The ham added a natural salt to the dish and I do like my fried eggs medium runny and it was perfect. The side salad was so simple, but perfect. The amount of dressing was perfect. My boyfriend got the sausage hash and was very happy about it. I tried a bite and it was yummy too. I was sort of involved with my dish and would get it again.
