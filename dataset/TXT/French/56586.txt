rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A First time at any Bouchon for dinner, and while I think brunch is still a better experience at Bouchon, dinner is not bad at all.

We started with a few things to share, and the Salade de Scarole aux Lardons et Oeuf Poche was probably our favorite.  It's a salad but there's an intense smokiness from the bacon and that poached egg was perfect.  Warm & cold.  Awesome.

I went with Steak Frites.  Good options always.  Steak was cooked to my liking without any issues.  I upgraded my fries to truffle fries, which is a must.  No bearnaise sauce here with the steak frites.  If you want the sauce, the Steak Bouchon is the one.  I tried a bit of my friend's Poulet Roti, which is roasted chicken, and made me wish I got the chicken instead.  Tender and juicy.  

A few got the special, which was a steak roast.  It was suppose to be medium rare, but all came out medium-well.  They sent it back but then we were told that they were roasted in batches, so they offered to swap it out with rib-eye cooked to medium-rare.  They waited for awhile before the food was served, which was a bummer.

Overall, it was good except for the hiccup with the specials.
