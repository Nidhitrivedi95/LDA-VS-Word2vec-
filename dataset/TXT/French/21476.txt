B5B0G6Yy_LDymFH7_ZNvyA I wouldn't normally choose a French restaurant for dinner, but it was late, and the only other places open were pubs or pizza joints. 

The waiter who greeted us at the door was super friendly, super informative, and super French (or else he was super talented at faking an accent). He told us right away which dishes they were out of (it was after 10 pm, after all), and then left us to look over the menu.

I decided to try their Coq a Vin (which I realized to my dismay that I'd pronounced incorrectly), and my husband ordered the Toulouse sausages. We also ordered a glass of the house red, which was served in a water glass. Is that normal?

While we waited, they brought out bread and our wine, which was a nice start. Our meals followed not long after, and I was immediately impressed. The dish that was set down in front of my husband was served with potatoes and had a sizeable salad included (which I'm sure he needed, at that point). They also brought out a container that had four different types of mustard for him to try. My coq a vin came out in a small pot, which our waiter then plated in front of me.

I've made coq a vin a couple times at home. At least, I've made what I thought of a coq a vin. After this meal, though, I realize that my dish is a sad imitation. Their version had a bold, rich flavor, without tasting overwhelmingly of red wine. The chicken was moist and tender, and the vegetables within the sauce were perfectly cooked, not mushy at all.

My husband, meanwhile, was so absorbed in the destruction of his meal that he had gone silent, except for the few yummy noises that escaped between chewing. I think he liked it.

We enjoyed the meal and the service very much - much more than I expected going in. The service was excellent, and the quality of the food - even at closing time - were top notch.
