KNBHGY4rQVuoHxZf_6ANuw The hotel itself is located in the old city, and steps away from all the historic sites -- which I consider a positive. Despite the room decor being a bit dated, this review is dedicated to the manager, Laurence. We were in Montreal for a special occasion and she was kind enough to upgrade us to one of the top floor / penthouse master suites. Thank you for your hospitality, and we look forward to visiting next time we're in town.
