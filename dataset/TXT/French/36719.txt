IE-FSNn9Zx9YFx3nJV4C1A Our first night in Montreal and Yelp led us to this lovely French Bistro restaurant.  They were 40 minutes from closing but welcomed us warmly.  

Girls had Prosecco and red wine and the boys had glasses of local beer. Bread and olive oil was served throughout the meal. I dined on a delicious shrimp dish. Service was attentive without being overbearing.
