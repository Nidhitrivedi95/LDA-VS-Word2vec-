4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Mon Ami Gabi wasn't originally part of the plan during our 3 day Vegas jaunt. However, in killing time before meeting friends at the Palms our tummies let us know it was time to get some pre-drinking eats in. And lo and behold Mon Ami Gabi appeared out of the corner of the Paris Hotel & Casino lobby like a mirage. (Actually my buddy has been raving about this place since our arrival, but her sales pitch couldn't deter us away from other eateries such as N9NE.)

We arrived shortly after 10pm and was seated right away. We were offered our choice of indoor or outdoor sitting, but since it was Dec 28, we opted for inside and got a great view of the Bellagio.

Being our 2nd meal of the evening we ordered two appetizers and a glass of Rose and MAG's very own Pinot Noir (pretty damn good). 

The chicken liver mousse was good, especially when paired with the 'burgundy red wine mustard' which seemed to be regular Dijon mustard with a hint of red wine. My only issue with this dish is the pate to toast ratio. The pate slab was very generous compared to the accompanying 4 toast wedges. 

The frisée salad was what I was waiting for and was disappointed when the server came back to tell us they were all out of frisée. I didn't want any of the other salads on the menu so I asked him if they can substitute the frisee with arugula, endive or even mixed greens (something similar in nuttiness). When the dish arrived the croutons, bacon bits and poached egg were sitting a-top a mountain of romaine!!
Boo-hoo sadness!!!  But after a bite, the disappointment was gone. The dish was delicious and I just may ask to have the salad made with romaine for future visits. 

All in all a great dining experience. The Pinot was great, as with the savory food coupled with great company and the extraordinary view of the strip and the Bellagio fountains.  And might I add, a better dining experience than N9NE.
