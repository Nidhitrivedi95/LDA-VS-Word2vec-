ohMpNug5zWNxOlL6ShG7Ig Very stuffy.  We ordered the cream of mushroom soup, and for the cost, you would have thought it would have tasted better.  The soup was bland, and there was no salt and pepper to be found.  We did have the truffle fries which were delicious, especially the truffle ketchup and mayo sauce.  My husband and I both ordered the Caesar Salad with chicken.  This salad was also bland, and the dressing was more like paste than dressing.  The colors of the salad were dreadful and the chicken was boiled with no flavor.  I may give this place a second chance because the service was good and there are other good reviews, but if I had to make a judgement on just food...I'd never go back.
