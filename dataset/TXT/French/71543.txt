XcWlBj5oQgzKhR7Cxovj3w Save your time and money. Very overpriced for such small portions. My wife ordered a breakfast sandwich and was still hungry afterwards so we stopped at Paradise Bakery, also because I had ordered oatmeal and they were out of it. My wife liked her sandwich, it was just small and overpriced. Service was extremely slow, even though it was not very busy.
