Seeing the look on my fiancé' face when she had the mushroom soup, was priceless, too. As she said, which perfectly describes everything we ordered, it was like fireworks of flavor when eating. The bell pepper soup was phenomenal as well. By far the best place I've been to, and reminds me why I love food so much and how much I appreciate the art of being a one of a kind chef.
