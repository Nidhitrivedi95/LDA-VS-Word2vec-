ovtlrcsVRlgZZQUlHs_ovw The hubs and I went there on a Friday evening for dinner and this place is truly unremarkable. The menu was just okay, food was okay, and drinks were just okay...the only thing remarkable about the place was the value or lack of value for the price that was paid. Service was okay, I thought that it should have been better since we were one of 3 couples in the place, not so. I won't drive to BFE for that restaurant ever again.
