rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Great poached eggs and corned beef hash but wow, salty. Good coffee and great pecan sticky bun - really small so don't skip the "pastry course". Really slow service; we arrived at 9:30am on a Monday and there were about 4 tables of people. However the hostess & waitress for our group of 8 was very nice.
