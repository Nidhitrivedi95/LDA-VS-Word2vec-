The Pork and Pistachio Pâté with Pickles - unique and memorable flavors I wouldn't try anywhere else. The Grilled Escarole Salad with Pickled Turnips, Parmesan, White Anchovy, Mustard Vinaigrette and a Crispy Poached Egg - the fanciest, yummiest salad I've had in a long, long time. And, wait for it, the cassoulet. Oh, the cassoulet. The Legume cassoulet, not available year-round but, again worth the wait, is perfection. It is a slow-simmered masterpiece. It is simple but rich. It is crusty on top and warm and creamy down below. Every single bite is the right balance of meat and bean and veggie. The mouth feel of the dish is worth it alone. I would eat mountains of Legume's cassoulet. If you only need one reason to go to Legume, it's the cassoulet.
