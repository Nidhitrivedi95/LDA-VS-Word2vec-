I ordered the special (it was a sandwich with tomato, onion, & Brie; with added bacon inside), I loved it. It came with fries on the side, and they were great! I'm used to the chunky fries that after 30 seconds get soggy, but these were super thin and crispy, wish all places made them like that. It's not like a regular sandwich by the way. Everything inside is seasoned with great flavor and probably cooked separately. I don't really know about the technicalities of it or how it was made, I just know it was great.
