KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA Made reservations for a Friday dinner for my folks and I to celebrate my lil' brother's HS graduation. What a great night. Walked through the wine shop amongst some great bottles and we were seated by the water. I tried the duck breast and it was pretty good. Would have likes a little salad too or something else to balance out the sweetness of the sauce, but all in all, good times. Had a glass of Tempranillo which went perfectly with the meal. We shared the bread pudding and a a creme brule to finish things off. Everyone had a great meal and a great time. Will come for more.
