3FlWR_osNPb8dcqLgHebHw We love this place. Never had a bad experience.
Tomato soup is acidic, and not for those with digestive issues... but it is tasty. 
The Marsala dishes are excellent!!

Our server, Kirk was awesome. Very attentive and friendly. Also, he really personalized the meal by asking lots of questions about preferences and taste.
Great job!!

The only issue was when the Manager, who I identified by him tag, but did not catch the name, took my GFs coffee. The had just mixed the sugar and cream, took one sip and set it down. The manager came by and just took it, without asking, and said "We just put on some fresh coffee, let me get you a new cup."

Hey Mr. Manager, some people like their coffee just the way it is.
A fresh pot is not always better, but either way, how about you ask first!!
