MSBND9JLWsONAEl36ZgW6g sorry to say I did not have a good experience at L'atelier.

We were a group so we had a set meal to choose from, which was HEAVILY laden with meat. I don't have anything against meat but when each course (except for desert) is meat centered and every option is meat centered its a bit much. There was no way to choose around this. 

I had to settle for instead of 4 courses to get 3, with a overdressed salad, but still paid the same price as people who were getting 4 courses of meat. 

The food in general was not outstanding for the price you pay.

The waiter was not very friendly either. seemed more interested in hanging out with his friends who were at the restaurant as well.
