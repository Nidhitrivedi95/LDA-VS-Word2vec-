rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A As stated and restated in hundreds of reviews before mine: the chicken and waffles are absolutely sublime.  If you are envisioning greasy fried chicken with soggy, limp waffles - you have to completely rethink things.  This is the elite version, and it is worth the trip to Vegas for them.

The chicken is roasted to perfection; crispy skin, but not fried.  The delectable combination of the bacon and chive flecked waffles, vanilla bean butter, warm syrup, and chasseur sauce was incredible and unbeatable.  I have returned two more times for the same meal!  We also enjoyed the beignets, and especially loved the accompanying jam.  The servings were plenty big enough to share. The service has been terrific on all of our visits, but I prefer to sit at the bar.  The service at the bar is wonderful, and the bartenders are engaging and interesting. 

This is a must-visit, don't miss spot on your next trip to Vegas.
