YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g FLEUR!!!!!! Wow. Wow. Wow. What else can I say? The BEST food I have ever eaten in my life. What the restaurant lacks in ambiance, it makes up for in taste. Everything was perfect. Order the white onion soup, organic heirloom carpaccio, roasted diver scallops, chicken entree, steak, and garlic fries. Everything here is great, so much flavor. I can't believe it's located in the Mandalay Bay, it deserves to stand in big cities all over.
