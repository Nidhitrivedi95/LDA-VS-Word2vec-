WOj8nPos3R9IIf0Pyttd8g A "foodie" adventure! Delicious, rich, and sumptuous. Refined French cuisine without the attitude. The escargot is sizzling and buttery and fettucini with egg is decadent. Lots of choices and for the less adventurous Lulu's offers a tasty hamburger. The place is great for a date or special night out. Bon appetite!
