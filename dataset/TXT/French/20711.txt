AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw We stopped by the stand/kiosk and I had heard it was good so we ordered the following items:

Double Chocolate Chip Cookie - you'll like this if you're a fan of chocolate: dark chocolate cookie with dark chocolate chunks.  It's a very thick, yet moist cookie with an interesting consistency...I really enjoyed it.

Milk Chocolate Malt Balls - these were the fanciest chocolate covered malt balls I've ever had and they were great - rich milk chocolate with the subtle, yet distinctive flavor of the malt...very good.
