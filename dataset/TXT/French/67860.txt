V0iYi5OjdRcz82m95jV7vQ Bonjour! J'aimerais manger un éclair. 

That is the extent of my French...but probably the most important. I will be well fed with a delicious pastry filled with vanilla custard with sugary icing.

It's a very small store front off of South Boulevard with, I think, maybe one cafe table with 2 chairs. They have a couple of cases to showcase their pastries. Besides the eclair, I ordered a French donut. Wow. Get the donut. 

They have quiche, flatbreads, and a variety of croissants. They can do custom orders, like cakes. You can get a fancy Croque-en-bouche!
