bVgRVpdPgwHBLa7RHb9CpQ Had a lovely duck confit salad & ricotta pasta. My salad was fresh, the endives crisp, and the duck was perfectly crispy.  Service was warm and friendly. 

It was a cold day so the terrace was not an option but it was still a lovely view by the window. 

Quiet, cute spot for casual dinner.
