4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Excellent Filet Mignon with butter and red wine reduction.  I was very surprised at their signature fries which reminded me of a wide flat linguini shape fry that was crunchy and soft at the same time, extremely addicting.  The only thing that wasn't spectacular was the steamed artichoke which was very plain, but everything else was excellent!  Ratatouille, French Cut fresh steamed beans and of course the Creme Brulee!
