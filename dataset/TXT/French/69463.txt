wfO1xdAeJMb_miGDU19W-w Just ok. I'm afraid so but that's where I have to leave things with Carmon's. I ate here on Valentine's Day with my girlfriend and it was just ok. We were both excited to come here having had a delcious Valentine's Day last year at Bacaro. Hearing that Carmon's was now under their management, we were excited! Overall, I felt like our expectations were only met part-way. 

I went for the cassoulet. It's a small portion but it's a stew of sausage and beans and duck confit and more richness so you will still get full, don't worry. I generally enjoyed the Cassoulet. My only complaint was that the wine wasn't cooked out all the way; the cassoulet really tasted of alcohol. It could also have just been a cheap wine that it was cooked with.

My girlfriend got the Steak Frites and was served a massive portion of delicious fries and not-so delicious steak. The service on a butcher block was cool but the hanger steak she got was served practically blue despite her saying medium-rare. Additionally the meat was exceptionally tough. Also, while I love meat that gets a great char and crust, her steak was super charred on the outside despite how raw it was on the inside. She probably ate two bites and just wound up finishing the fries.

Overall, Carmon's was a charming and inviting space for Valentine's with professional and friendly staff. Unfortunately, the quality of our meal was just ok.
