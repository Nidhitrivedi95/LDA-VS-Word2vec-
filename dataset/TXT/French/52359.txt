Some days they're right on top of things and other days the waiters just walk right by you way after you're seated without even filling your glass of water. There is a serious problem with the way this restaurant is run. It is a shame because my husband and I live right across the street and we love their brunches. But I would be nervous inviting people here or even recommending it...
