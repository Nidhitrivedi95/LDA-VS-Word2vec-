33Tr0eRki1Yamzleu4GMdw I like what they've built here. They're trying something that is unique (in Las Vegas at least). A French style cafe. I wish they'd gone farther and replaced the old flooring and boring white ceiling tile. The display area is nicely done and the baked items are impressive. I don't know if they bake them here or not but this is the difference between small shop and Starbucks "baked" goods. The quiche wasn't the best but the eggs au gratin was tasty. Lattes are good. Not quite perfect yet but better than Starbucks. Would recommend trying this place out if you're on west side.
