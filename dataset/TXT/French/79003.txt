ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug We had an evening flight into Vegas on Christmas Eve.  Since we were staying in Paris and we were hungry for a quick meal,we decided to go to Le Cafe Ille Saint Louis. We didn't have a long wait since we have our Total Rewards Silver cards.  We were seated inside the restaurant facing the "outdoors" patio.  We waited and waited for a server to come and get our drink orders.  Hubby is particular about ordering.  He likes to sip his drink while he looks over the menu.  As usual, he asked for a couple of minutes to make up his mind when the drinks arrived.  The server gave him the nastiest look!  She stormed off and returned a few minutes later.  I ordered the onion soup and the Croque Monsieur.  Hubby ordered a Ceasar Salad with shrimp.  The soup came and it was quite good (the only reason this place gets a star!).  Luckily, I shared it with hubby, who had to wait ages before our entrees came.  
My Croque Monsieur was soaked in butter.  I took a couple of bites and couldn't go on.  Hubby's salad was actually decent and he enjoyed it.  
Overall, a horrible experience and one I don't plan to repeat.  The food at its best is mediocre.  The service unbelievably horrible.  The family next to us (and had been seated before us) were still waiting to order while we had already been served my soup.  Eventually, our server took their order but by the time we finished our dinner, their food still hadn't arrived.  Realizing that they were French and spoke very little English, hubby intervened on their behalf with the manager.  The last we saw of the manager, he was looking for someone who spoke French.  Hope they got their dinner!
