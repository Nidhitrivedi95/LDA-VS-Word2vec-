Ncvd4l3zo72FUK5kovQhYQ After a lucky break finding a nearby parking space, we ventured into this establishment. 
The order is placed at the counter & your food is brought to you. Self service for the beverages. 
I had the western omelette & roasted red potatoes. 
My meal was flavorful & the portion size was very generous. 
My husband had the crepe with egg, bacon & cheese w/ a side of roasted red potatoes. Again, generous portion & full of flavor. 
The atmosphere was lively. It's a bonus that a lot of the food is prepared where you have a clear view of the process. There is also a display case full of culinary delights. 
I only wish there was better ventilation as it was a bit smoky from the non-stop activity at the grills. 
I enjoyed my experience overall & look forward to trying more menu items.
