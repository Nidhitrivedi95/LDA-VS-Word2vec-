rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w This restaurant is smaller and more intimate than I expected, which is a good thing. Our personable and friendly bartender "Gene" took cared of us at the bar with some drinks and a beef tartare to start...Isn't it always better to propel the evening at the bar and get to know everyone first? The Maître D presented us with one of the best table, overlooking the Bellagio fountain (and Paris across the street). The service was of course impeccable, as our sommelier and server were attentive to our every need, without asking. Appetizers with frog legs and another paella dish were good. The piece of resistance was the whole Duck a L'orange, for two, with a consume. Absolutely succulent and delicious! The high quality chocolate soufflé was a nice finish. To be back next time for the tasting menu!
