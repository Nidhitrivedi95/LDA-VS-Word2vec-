O3OH5IEFMPtz7mPKakPZ3Q I really enjoyed a nice dinner for 3 at this restaurant. We ate for under $75 for 3 people and we're satisfied. The food is good and presented well. Some items may need a touch more salt, but the overall experience will have me coming back again. I especially am hapoy that foie gras is available down the street from home when I'm craving it
