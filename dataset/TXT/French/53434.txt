QlSpPzc4Oy05ic-PsoYH4g I met a friend at Streets the other day for dinner! I have been wanting to go for so long because two of my friends are regulars and have been telling me how much I would enjoy it. When I came in, it was pretty early and there weren't very many people there. My girlfriend was late so I ordered a cocktail and made some conversation with the bartender. She was super cool and the drinks were good.When my friend came, we decided to just eat at the bar. We split several appetizers, all of which were pretty spot on! The pork belly steamed buns were my favorite but I also enjoyed the arancini. My one comment would be in regards to the poutine. I really enjoy cheese/gravy/potatoes and salt. You really have to be insane to not love those things (sorry my vegan friends but y'all are kooked) but there was just way too much salt on the fries and it was intense. Overall a great experience, I might not get the poutine when I go back but I will definitely go back.
