An_U8woQkFVsMqVblkImZQ super cute decor and it's really nice in the summer when they have their doors all open.  

my first time I came here for lunch and had the Mushroom & Chèvre Sandwich (mushroom & pesto with salad). oh.my.god. probably the best open face sandwich I have ever had! a MUST try.

another time for dinner i started with the mushroom soup which was REALLY good. a large portion as well.  my main was the Mushroom Pappardelle.  It was kind of dry and bland, nothing special at all.  Dessert I got a chocolate mousse cake and I was expecting it to be fantastic since this place is known for their desserts.  SO disappointing though.  The cake was dry and hard, and the mousse was also hard.  it was 2 day old cake, so I told the waitress and returned it. She was super rude and gave me attitude when she brought the creme brulee i ordered instead (which was nothing great).  Her service was bad all night long (which I had no problems when i came for lunch) actually.  I will never come back for dinner again.
