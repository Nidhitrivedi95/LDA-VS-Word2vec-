JezHN-9KKLTMbojq00VP0g I've had this cafe on my list of places to go eat at over a year, and I have to say, I came away dissapointed with my experience. 

As always, let's talk service, and then food. 

We went to La Petit for Brunch on a Sunday Afternoon. We reached the cafe at 12:45 pm and were promptly seated outdoors, as the indoor section "was full and reserved", even though we plainly saw three empty booths and not a single person walk in to occupy those over the next two hours. 
15 minutes of waiting later, someone showed up with menus for us and allowed us to order coffees. The coffees took about 30 minutes to show up, and the person who delivered them was not the same person "who could take an order". Cue another 15 minutes - it is now 1:45 pm - our orders were taken. We ordered three relatively simple dishes - a sandwich, a bowl of soup, an omelet and a crepe. The soup was bought out after 15 minutes (2:00 pm) and then we had to wait another 40 minutes for the food. 
Being seated at 12:45 pm, we were finally served food at 2:45 pm. 2 hours for brunch service. Brilliant (that was sarcasm just in case you were unsure). 

All this would have been ok if we were blown away by the food, but sadly, we were not. 
The onion soup ($5) lacked substance, flavor and salt. 
The smoked salmon omelet was served fairly cool, with an oily (almost fried) skin and a hard dense egg interior - whatever happened to fluffy french omelets?!
The crepe was thick and tasted OK at best - you can get better for cheaper in the westside market.
The sandwich, I suppose, was actually good.

All in all a disappointing service with disappointing food. Not a place I will be going back to anytime soon of my own accord.
