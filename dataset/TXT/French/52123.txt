pmrHuQiy25xKB86tbOLBlA Structurally, the restaurant is quite charming - in a row of buildings on the national register of historic places, lots of exposed brick and tin ceilings.

Lunch service is "leisurely" - not quite slow, but certainly not at a pace that will get you back to the office in an hour.

The menu always underwhelms me though.  Not sure if it wants to be french (see the cheese plate appetizer which is large enough to be an entree), southwestern (several items are infused with chiles, corn, avocado or black beans) or something else.  

This is a place we go once or twice a year as a change of pace.  But I can't seem to find anything compelling to bring me here more often - although I'd like to find one!

Note to either server or kitchen - if the soup of the day is a Shellfish Gumbo, why put calamari in it?  Or has calamari become a shellfish?
