iwFoA98-OgcdXmNS0LxNOA First time here and will definitely be back!

Decided to come here on a Sunday night after looking for a late night local bar to hang out at, turns out they close at midnight! We were a large group, about 14, having a pre-wedding celebration. 

We arrived at 10:30 so considering how dead it was, we were seated right away. Most of us came for drinks. We ordered 3 litres of their blonde, it was massive.... Others ordered their own drinks. And someone orders the apple dessert, it was huge but soooo good!

I have a feeling this will be a regular go-to place for local late night eats, drinks and hang outs!
