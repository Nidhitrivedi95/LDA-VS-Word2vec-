But for the last week, for me...COFFEE was the lifeblood of my little Vegas country. Especially with 8:30am startings of long meetings, with short breaks, quick rushes to the bathroom, stolen gelato moments.

But yeah, coffee. I wouldn't have made it without it. And Pinot Brasserie's little standalone coffee & bakery stand, being right around the corner from the Venetian Conf Center, was a lifesaver. Quick service, with yummy croissants. Lattes were just okay but you can't go wrong with a cup of dark roast and some whole milk. Hits the spot.
