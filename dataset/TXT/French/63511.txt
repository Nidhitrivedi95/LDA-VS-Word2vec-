t1mR_Zff6Dqv1TueE2JLEA We were warned that we should not go to this place and this is after we had made reservations two weeks in advance. We were told the food is terrible especially the lamb and the belly dancers are not good either. 
Well our experience was very pleasant, the food was great, from the starter to the main course (yes I opted for lamb and every bit of it was Amazing). Go for the lamb if you are doing the four course meal thing. The dancers put on a great show as well.
I would definitely go back to this pace, just make sure you ask them to be seated in one of the tents and not in the way.
