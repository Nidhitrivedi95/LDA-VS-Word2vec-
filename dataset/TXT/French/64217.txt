Small and quaint they pack them in a bit more for CRW it seems but the giant pics of France will take you away. The CRW menu includes a cheese plate course. I had the beef short ribs which were perfectly braised tender and juicy. The bread pudding dessert was great as well. You can't go wrong here if you are in the mood for a little French cooking.
