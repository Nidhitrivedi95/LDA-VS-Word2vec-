RoGeo_pQ1TQc6Lyk4CSDgw the service was nice, but the food is SOOOOO overrated. I always pick the most expensive meal to make sure that what I eat is good. Turns out it was disgusting, felt like white people don't know how to seasoned their meals. It basically tasted like salt, pepper, and Ice. OH AND THEIR SALAD,  I DON'T KNOW IF THEY THOUGHT I WAS A GOAT OR SOMETHING BUT SERVING SOMETHING SIMILLAR AS BASILIC IS NOT A SALAD. and their fanous poutine, guys, it tasted like pure shit. this restaurant is fancy looking but the food is saddly, not good. Food court in the carrefour laval serves better food than this shitty restaurant. If you want to WASTE your money, go ahead!
