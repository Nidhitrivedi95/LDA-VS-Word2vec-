4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Love Mon Ami (Gabi)!   Everything we ordered was really good.   French onion soup was superb; burrata cheese and salmon tartare appetizers were fantastic; steak with frites was perfectly seasoned, cooked to perfection and the banana foster crepe was the "happy ending" to our dining experience!

Bravo, highly recommend this place!
