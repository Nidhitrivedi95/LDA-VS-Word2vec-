The service is impeccable and they seem to treat every customer with lots of care. I had high expectations for this place as I had heard great things, but sadly I wasn't wowed. We ordered the mushroom puffs, chicken pate, duck for two and French fries. The two standouts were the duck and mushrooms. The puff pastry was excellent and mixed with the sauce was a great combination. The duck breast was also very well done, but the duck confit leg was a little disappointing. It felt dry to me, but had a nice skin. Other things we ordered were pretty forgettable. I'd come back still to try the chicken as that seems pretty popular here as well.
