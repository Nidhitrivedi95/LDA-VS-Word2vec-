X8lYvkI2Yv7f96cz4uE9LQ I cannot ask for a better place to eat in Montréal. The atmosphere is almost as funky as the restaurant's name. An X-ray observation lamp with two monkey heads and what appears to be an X-ray film of a hip can be spotted on the wall of this hipster garage restaurant. Very nice touch indeed. 

We started off with cocktails. I had the amaretto kumquat old fashioned which was amazing! Different from the traditional but worth breaking the rules to explore something more refreshing. Also to mention that our server was very helpful and understanding throughout our entire stay. 

Every dish was presented like a gem and tasted like heaven. Each element on the plate went so well with each other. If every restaurant offered food as good as Les Deux Singes de Montarvie, the world would be in a better place

If someone asked me where they should go eat in Montréal - Les Deux Singes de Montarvie would be my answer.
