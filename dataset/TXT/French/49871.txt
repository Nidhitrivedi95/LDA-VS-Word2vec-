oS96aJIHFWcFAlGHKKXjaw My husband and I arrived at La Gourmandine eight minutes after they opened on a Saturday morning and there was already a line out the door. The line moved fairly quickly, but the trick is to have an idea of what you want before you arrive (if you plan on going for an early morning breakfast). They'll ask you what you'd like before you ever really get a good glance at the dessert display. 

Everyone is incredibly friendly and patient. I highly recommend the croissants. The quiche was delicious. The moelleux at chocolat was a chocolate lovers dream. 

Will definitely be back.
