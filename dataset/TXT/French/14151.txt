58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw Great place to go for brunch in Old Montreal! The portion size is very good, especially when you order the Le Cartet specials. The amuse bouche, which are included in all of their specials, is typically bread pudding and they are absolutely delicious! It's a must try! I highly recommend getting the Le Cartet Atlantique. It is a smoked salmon inspired dish, that includes a bagel with cream cheese and smoked salmon (you can ask to switch to a different type of bread), salmon omelette, salad, fruit, and orange juice. Their croissants are decent, but not the best.
