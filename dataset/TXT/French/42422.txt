lcTa0q9Wo4wNyLCIgWFRUA Was introduced to this restaurant by a client and now he is a friend. The food is superb and the service attentive but not overbearing. I had the NY Strip cooked to perfection with a starter if PEI oysters. The other members of my party had the lobster roll, minimum mayo with a sprig of fresh dill to make it new and interesting. Did I mention the brioche roil? House made and Devine. Very close to a French bistro understanding we are in North America, so go, enjoy.
