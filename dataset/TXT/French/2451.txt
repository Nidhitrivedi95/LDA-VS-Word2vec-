0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g I never wanted to write this review however I felt that I have to. 
My wife and our friends the 4 of us made  the reservation at Picasso restaurant in Vegas, at 8:15 pm on sat 3/18/2017. we specially requested water view location for 3 week. (Jenny Nguyen customer )we were willing to wait but they said they do not have the water view after our wait. 
This place has terrible service, employees face up in the air, never offer us any drink for waiting, who the heck do they think they are and the worst of all they have the nerve tell us that they did not have the water view for us. They are not good enough to clean my shoes. 
They should learn to be nicer to their customer. Without us they cannot pay their rent. Pathetic
