rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A The food was fine.  Nothing spectacular.  The service was terrible.  We had a group of 7 and although the listed policy was to add an automatic gratuity for parties of 8 or more, they added it automatically for us and coincidentally, the Service went to heck for the 2nd half of our meal.  I would not go back nor should you.
