50-xiTYmE6NERi-yJ6NvHw Super nice, efficient, professional service. Mediocre food. Nice atmosphere. A solid 3 stars. It's probably useful to note, though, that this place as a 'high end', 'upscale' restaurant would sink rapidly in any other major city due to the food. I'll definitely return, but I'm sticking to the bar and the appetizers.
