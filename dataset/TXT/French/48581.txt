ohMpNug5zWNxOlL6ShG7Ig I don't know about you- maybe I'm cheap, but can anyone really go anywhere for lunch around the valley for $20 or less (for two)? OK-- Taco Bell, Del Taco, or In and Outs. Never mind. 

We live in Cave Creek, and drive past Cafe Bink on occasion. Stopped in for lunch and really enjoyed it. This place is for the "well-heeled," as they say. These folks don't shop at Bashas'. Their go-to grocery is AJ's. Get my drift? 

Anywho, we had the prosciutto-wrapped breadsticks for an app. They had truffled cream cheese. YUM. Just yum. Hubby had the gourmet hot dog, which was delish. I had the chicken sandwich, again delish. The service was great. We sat on the patio, watching those well-heeled folks.

 $50 for lunch. 

*gulp*

We'll be back, but I may have to sell my Manolos on Craigslist to go there.
