rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Loved the beignets. Loved the free bread with the jam and butter. Loved the croque madam. Guess I just loved it all. 

Our waitress Arleen was super awesome. We asked for our extra bread to go and brought us back a lot more than what we had left. My mom was so excited for that.
