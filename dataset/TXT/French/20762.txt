AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw Great place to have a cup of coffee or tea! They have small tables on the side so you can sit back, relax and enjoy your little snacks and tea. 

I had the white chocolate latte and wow, it was really really good. I keep ordering white chocolate latte's now wherever I go and I haven't been able to find one as good as this one was. It was the perfect amount of sweetness and tasted creamy and just plain yumness. 

My parents had the tea's, according to them they were fine....but than again its black tea :) We also had the juice mix which was pretty good, just beware that the small is like super duper huge. We had a croissant as well and it was very good. 

Ambiance is cute, white chocolate latte is good and croissants are good!! I will definitely be coming back here when I visit Vegas again!
