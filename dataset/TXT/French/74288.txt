xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g Service top notch! Attire is slacks and a dress shirt for men and women dressy. Get there early and request a window table facing waterfalls! Had the seafood appetizer and it was perfect. We ordered the duck, the lamb, rabbit and the filet mignonette and every plate was amazing. Several rounds of cocktails and the soufflé for desert Definitely not cheap. $625 not including tip. If you like fine dining ad great food go!
