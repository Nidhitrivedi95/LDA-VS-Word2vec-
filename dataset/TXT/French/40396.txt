KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA I've been here numerous times over the last 8 years but had yet to go to their happy hour.  The wines are not that inexpensive:  $8 for Chateau Monfort Vouvray Chenin Blanc & Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc to go along with the $9 happy hour specials of cheese plate, lobster monte cristo & a few other items.  On Fri they have jazz from 5-7 but the happy hr is 5-8 on M-F.  So it's a tasty bite & drink which was fun on a Fri nite so you can still go out esp if you need to get in early for Sat.
