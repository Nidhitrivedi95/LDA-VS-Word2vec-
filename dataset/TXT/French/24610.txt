cNkm08qu--yjIY_NPxrS2g This was an awesome experience despite the medium reviews, we decided to go. The view was spectacular and the service is amazing. The food came quickly and was delicious.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone. It is on the pricey side but I don't complain if the service and food is great, and it was!
