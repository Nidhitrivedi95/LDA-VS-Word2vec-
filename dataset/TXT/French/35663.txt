htQgj-ANQpZGpIpkkrEmyQ "Omg inspire is the best place in markham omgomg, it's SOOOO good" Just kidding. This isn't every other review on this page. Maybe I expected a bit too much, but I didn't fall head over heels for inspire like every other girl. 

When we walked in, we weren't really greeted by the server. She looked at us and said "do you have a reservation?" and kind of grimaced when we said no.. then without a word, she led us to the back of the restaurant and gave us menus. Her mood probably got better, because she was a lot more tolerable and friendlier as the minutes passed. The server assigned to our table, however, was amazing. She was super quick, friendly and caring- kept checking up on our water levels every once in awhile so there were no shriveled up dehydrated bodies left in the restaurant. My boyfriend and I ordered the pulled pork frites to share and OMGGGGGGG THIS IS WHAT LOVE FEELS LIKE!! I don't even like green onion but it worked SO well for this dish.. to be honest, I didn't want to share with my boyfriend anymore... I would've taken the whole dish for myself but he drove me here, and I don't want to be left behind. We each also got a chicken and waffles (super famous here) after we couldn't find the udon carbonara on the menu.. WHAT HAPPENED? The serving was huge and it was presented nicely but I've had better fried chicken from KFC. The waffles were yummy, but too much syrup.. I would've preferred that we all get control of our own syrup next time. It ended up being too much and I finished just around half when I got it to go and gave it to my boyfriend, since he devoured his even though he said it was too sweet as well. 

It was nice to try! I'll probably be back and try other dishes! Somebody please let me know if the udon carbonara comes back!
