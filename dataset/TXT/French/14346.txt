58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw As an infrequent visitor of Montreal, Le Cartet is one of my favorite restaurants for breakfast and brunch. Such wonderful food that I think is healthful but doesn't taste like health food.  Despite the bustling flow of people through the place, the staff remains enjoyable.  Love love love this place and wish we had one here in New York!
