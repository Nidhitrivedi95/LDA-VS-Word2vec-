4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Went here for breakfast but missed it by half an hour. Had to settle for their version of a french dip. Didn't care for it at all. Everyone raved about it on the reviews, but I didn't care for it at all.

BREAKFAST IS WAY BETTER!!! THE EGGS BENEDICT IS AMAZING WITH THE CORN BEEF HASH!! BREAKFAST IS 5 STARS!
