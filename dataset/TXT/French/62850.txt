SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ You get what you pay for when, and especially when it comes to House of Tricks! This is our, go-to, romantic dinner night out place! My husband and I have celebrated our anniversary here before, and they even gave us a lovely spot in the back of the garden that was secluded from the majority of guests and very quiet! It made for a very lovely evening! The wine selections were fair, although I think they could invest in carrying a different selection of pinot grigio and chardonnay. The whites were a bit lacking, and I'm not a huge reds fan. I wish I could give this place a 4.5 stars rather than 4! I think what would make it a 5 for me would be to add to the wine selection! We will most definitely be back! Cheers!
