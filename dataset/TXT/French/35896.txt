hvjgF-vnPw2jyL5DBuB0qg Food here is good but overpriced for what it is. $35 for 3 scallops?? I really take issue with 1. The wine list-every bottle is greater than $50. Which I find obnoxious but would be fine with if it was decent. My $65 of Canadian Riesling tasted like it should have been $12. My second issue was with the extremely poor service. When spending $300 on a dinner for 2 I expect to not have to flag down my waitress on multiple occasions. We wound up skipping dessert because the service was just terrible and we couldn't wait anymore.
