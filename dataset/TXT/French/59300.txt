rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w I've dined at this establishment on several occasions and I find myself going back for more! Can't get enough of their lobster salad (Salade de Homard) and the filet mignon with the foie gras on top (Cœur de Filet de Bœuf).

I must say that the atmosphere is great. As you can derive from its name, Le Cirque has a circus theme - the walls are covered with cartoon drawings of circus performers and the menu is covered in simple circus decor. The upholstery of the restaurant is striped (as consistent with the theme) and the view, should you have the privilege, of the Bellagio fountains from a window seat is absolutely amazing. Of course, it's even more spectacular if you are present when the fountain shows are active.

The experience with the staff/servers has always been pleasant. Most people think, "Well, if I'm paying these prices to get an upscale meal, I should be getting the greatest service". That, however, hasn't always been the case with some of the fine dining places that I've been to. Le Cirque has a staff of laid-back, down-to-earth people. It's always a pleasure speaking to the folks. 

All the dishes are pretty amazing. No need for any additional flavoring... and that's the way it should be. No substitutions needed because the food is superb the way it is. It's probably preference on my part, but I prefer their cut of beef over the veal or rabbit.

Can't wait to experience Le Cirque again. Have doubts about going? Don't. Just try it.
