We ordered two chicken Parmigiana sandwiches, one eggplant sandwich, one Kurt's chicken burger, one pastrami sandwich, three chocolate cannolis and two regular cannolis. They gave me two free regular cannolis since I ordered a veal parmigiana sandwich and they were out. Yep, so we had a total of 7 cannolis! Very nice of them. The staff was very friendly and was hard at work cooking. Cashier offered to put my food in a large box to make it easier for me to carry. I'll definitely come back!
