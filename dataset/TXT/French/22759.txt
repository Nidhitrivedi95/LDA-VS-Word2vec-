bzbNGyrTwWHAgg1CqkSgeg We've been here twice. Both times there was a wait, it seems as if there is ALWAYS a wait on a Sunday late morning/early afternoon. The service is nice. The food is great. The first time we had the stuffed french toast. IT WAS AMAZING! When we returned, it said they were french toast sticks, not sure why they changed it. Also, the first time we had the chicken and waffles. IT WAS AMAZING! The chicken was fried to perfection and the waffle was so yummy. 

This recent time we ordered the Lemon Poppy french toast, which tasted more like a pound cake, but it was AMAZING! We also ordered the special for that day which was a chocolate chip waffle, with white chocolate drizzle. I was also amazing and not super sweet or chocolatey.
