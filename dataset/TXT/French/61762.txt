sphMzEIqY1I2Dzv3zLZY2g Global is like two restaurants in one.  Downstairs is casual and open and upstairs is more classy and elegant.  On the night our trip through the Charlotte area, there was a wine tasting event downstairs so we were given a lovely table upstairs near a window.  

We began the evening with some local craft beer and the Beef Tartare from the starter menu.  The beef was properly chilled and the extras were good.  Our only complaint is the description says it comes with local pickled vegatables but we only recieved two small pieces of cauliflower :(

Moving on, we enjoyed a delicious bottle of red wine with Carolina Shrimp small plate.  Everything on the plate was tasty, though a bit too room temp...

Next, Schweety had the Baby Lettuce Salad with had a nice mix to it and I had the Mussels, which I will say was some of the best that I've ever had.  

Service was friendly and knowledgeable with the the right amount of attentiveness!
