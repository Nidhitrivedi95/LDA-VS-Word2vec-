HojKatUfX4UHWaPqtl63NQ Beautiful place and nice view! Thank you, everybody for reviews. I got a table on the balcony and ordered bison + pot of veggies! My friends ordered octopus salad, coffee and Tiramisu. We had a great evening. Yes, portions are small, but enough for ladies who watch out their food. I appreciate very much when food is not over salted, so I am totally happy with with portion size and quality. The only thing to be prepared is - if you celebrate a birthday, bring cake with you (they allow) and restaurant do not offer complimentary birthday cupcake with candles, staff do not sing "Happy Birthday" song :)
So, I surely recommend to visit this place and to spend great evening to remember!
