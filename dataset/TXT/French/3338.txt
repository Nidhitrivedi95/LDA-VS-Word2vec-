1cGyzWtfOoDiE8V0OR85yA I wish this place was open for longer hours! For the past couple of months, I've had a tricky time trying to make it here, so I'm happy that I finally managed to get here for lunch.  I visited on a Tuesday around 12:30. It was tiny inside, and it was packed, but the food was totally worth the wait! Actually, I was slightly relieved that there was a line, so that I could have time to decide on my order because the menu was pretty extensive in terms of crepes and waffles.  

I finally (after serious contemplation) decided on the smoked salmon crepe with creme fraiche sauce.  All savory crepes included a side salad, so I had a salad with mandarin oranges and champagne vinaigrette.  My salad was really good, but my crepe was even better....I never wanted it to end! The smokey flavor and saltiness was exactly what I was expecting (and hoping for) when I ordered it! 

When I was leaving, I noticed that some people were stopping in and taking crepes to go, I will have to remember to treat myself to one of their dessert crepes soon! I would strongly recommend it to those looking for a change in their regular lunch break routine!
