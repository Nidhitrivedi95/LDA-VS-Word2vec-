ehRigNzlkRQlvhzKr7PLCQ As others have mentioned, the cause behind this restaurant really is wonderful. The presentation of the food was beautiful. However, our dinner really wasn't good. There was just no getting around the fact that we didn't enjoy the flavor. No plates went back to the kitchen licked clean.

I get that the price point is low and they are trying to provide a higher end experience for a very reasonable price. I don't think this will work though until they use higher quality ingredients and improve their flavor.

Service was also spotty. Again, I understand the servers are volunteers and I respect that. We could tell, however, that the staff weren't servers in their day jobs.
