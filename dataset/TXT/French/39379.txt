jSfnItqaOnEp2nenVF7fCg For most people in the valley this little bistro is to far away for them to dine at.  I'll give you a few reasons why should check this place out.  It's not far away from the Surprise baseball stadium, so it could be your choice to have lunch before a spring training game.  It is directly on your way by car to Vegas from Phoenix.  Or here's another reason, it really is worth the drive because how great the food is.

A very small place with about 20 seats so it's very quaint as you would expect.   Nicely decorated with a french flair and a large window looking directly into the kitchen.  So you get to see the chef in action!  

On to the meal, the Cabernet Burger is one of the tastiest that I have ever had.  Marinated in cabernet sauvignon, topped with swiss cheese, applewood bacon, and carmelized onions.  The flavors ooze all over the bun and into your mouth.  Also comes with some delicately delicous fries.  A little crispy, but not to much, just the way I like it.

This restaurant is a great addition to the neighborhood.  Who would have thought Surprise would have such a great place to eat!
