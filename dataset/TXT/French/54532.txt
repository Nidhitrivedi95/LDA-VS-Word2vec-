rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw Firstly I really like the style of this bistro. It's French retro yet stylish, not pretentious like some of the restaurants in Vegas. I came here for both dinner and brunch. Here are my verdicts:
- French onion soup: love the top crust. It's beautifully golden, and when u open it with your fork, u feel the cheese underneath.
- prime rib eye: it's good but not the best I had. Perhaps I like it with slightly more fat.
- hunter's waffle: interesting twist from classic egg Benedict. They put duck confit in between a waffle and the runny egg. I wish the chef would consider to put some fresh green like lettuce or arugula with this dish to "freshen" up the taste of the whole dish.
- escargots: 4 pcs. Thought it would come in 6 pcs as I saw it from other Yelpers' photos. Regardless that, the whole dish is good. 

Will come back and try their famous French Toast!!
