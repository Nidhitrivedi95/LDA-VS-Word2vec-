SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA Enjoyed an awesome luncheon with my wife at L'Albatros in the University Circle area this afternoon. We started with Chicken Liver and Fois Gras Mousseline with toast points and glasses of Duval-Leroy, Brut, Clos des Bouveries, Vertus, 2004 Champagne. Then Roasted Artichokes with Lemon Aioli, Mushroom soup with shaved Parmesan, and an entree of Duck Confit with sweet potato puree and braised cabbage. Accompanying the entree, I had an unbelievable Vouvray, Huet, "Le Mont," Sec, 2010 while my wife enjoyed a red wine, Malbec, Clos La Coutale, Cahors, 2011. For dessert we had the Chocolate Napoleon with whipped cream and raspberries, French-pressed Jamaican coffee, and Cointreau. I love this restaurant.
