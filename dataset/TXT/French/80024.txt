ZuYsZvJ5r32Fs70vPXbRgw Let me start by saying...I love french food.
3 of dined here tonight for summerlicious.  One of our DC's was a little late, so they ran out of hen stuffed with something and fois gras.  That aside, dinner was tasty.

Two of us ordered the scallop ceviche (yummy), but even more yummy was my friend's order of tempura eggplant (not what you would expect at all, but definitely super delish, my DC was kind enough to offer a taste).

Having run out of stuffed hen, 2 of us went with the white fish (dourade, or something), delicious, light textured, a light flavour, with a delectable cream sauce on a buttery gnocchi concoction with peas.  My DC made the better choice of 2 types of pork (pork belly and a pork chop - OMG I could have devoured her entire plate).

For dessert, chocolate mousse was ordered - yummy, the beignets (the best option), and the cucumber sweet soup - this was actually tasty, light and refreshing, but it's no chocolate mousse.  We didn't try the last dessert.

If I were to do it all again, I'd do the eggplant tempura, the pork dish, and the beignets...

Happy dining!
