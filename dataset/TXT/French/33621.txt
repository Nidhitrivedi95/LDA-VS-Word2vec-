hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA I am fortunate enough to work near the Baguette cafe and go there at least 2-3 times a month for lunch. Their food is amazing! My only complaint that if you arrive after 11:30 there is going to be lots of people a wait for the food and possible no place to sit.......But the food is worth the wait! But i just get there early and avoid the wait!
