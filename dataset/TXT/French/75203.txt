y0cgy0tTh_C8NWCk0WGgjQ Food was a welcome change up to the usual St.Clair grub.  Portions are quit large, if not a bit intimidating.  Wife had a veal chop that was gluten free and was a touch over cooked(med rare was ordered medium-well was delivered). My steak frites was very tasty, however I would prefer a more peppery peppercorn sauce. The frites were good but those too were overcooked for my liking.
