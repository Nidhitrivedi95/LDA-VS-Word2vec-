We ordered the duck poutin, very fresh but you must have a stomach for rich food. We also ordered the beef ribs which were Asian inspired and nice. A bit on the salty side but tasty. All in all the food and service were good but the bill is pricey for what you eat.

Came back for breakfast the next morning and had a lovely server. We ate eggs Benedict and yogurt with berries and granola, all amazing. French press coffee was done right. The bill was very pricey for breakfast for 2 as was dinner last night.
