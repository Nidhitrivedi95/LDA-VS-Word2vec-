4cWrtMvfj-tomyEPgP7KFg We always hit The Melting Pot during Restuarant Week, because for $30 a person it truly is a smashing deal for a three-hour foodie experience.  Make sure you CALL the restaurant to make a reservation if you have more than 4 in your party because often times a party of 6 or more will allow you to get 2 burners at the table.  The menu during RW allows you to try the cheese fondue course (we really like the Spinach Artichoke dip one and the cheddar is really good too!), the salad (I LOVE the California--- delicious and fresh!), the main course (be sure you pay the $5 upgrade to try the mojo cooking style) which includes fresh seafood and beef cuts.... Along with this ravioli concoction that is truly incredible.  The main course comes with an array of sauces..... Green Goddess is my favorite, although our server suggested to try his favorite which is a blue cheese sauce and I LOVED it, especially with the pasta! The service is always divine and they talk you through your entire experience.  It ends with the piece de resistance..... The chocolate.  We opted for the Flaming Turtle and the Yin and Yang..... Amazing!!!!! I say if you've never "fondued" before.... Definitely Do! :)
