LjOBNcNNpuewBqSPxYYTJQ I was so excited to try this place after reading the reviews from the other locations. The husband and I went for desert on date night. The place was really busy. I chose a torte and he chose a strawberry cake...sorry for the lack of description.  Bottom line is that the pastries were just ok. Nothing to write home about. Service was just ok as well. I would return simply because there are no other bakeries of this kind in the area. It's a relaxed atmosphere which is nice. Great for dates and just chatting with friends.
