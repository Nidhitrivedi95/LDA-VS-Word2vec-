v50-nvBCZNf7nCNbyUlQLw I must admit the crepes here are quite tasty, very reminiscent of ones I have had in France and I especially appreciate the fresh green salad that accompanies some.

That said, their seating system is quite confusing upon the first visit.  They won't take your order unless there is an open table.  Makes sense, unless there are clueless people in front of you who had half their party sit at the last open table... gridlock.

Anyhow, quite a lovely experience but I'm not sure it was enough to lure me back to the dark side, also known as Walnut st (or Shadyside in general), all too often.
