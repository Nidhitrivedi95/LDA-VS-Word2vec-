HojKatUfX4UHWaPqtl63NQ I went to the newly remodeled space above Delano this week for a nice dinner at Rivea and cocktails to start in Skyfall Lounge.

The room was beautifully redone with blue and brown hues amongst the glistening chandelier . The patio is still there with colorful chairs and tables. In the back they remodeled a stunning dining room. It is set against a backdrop of the glittering Las Vegas skyline, and above the sparkling lights mimic the constellations of the universe!

Food and Service were stellar and the experience was definitely 5 star. Seafood and fresh produce splash the menu with seasonality.  I had the lobster and purple artichokes. I never heard of purple artichokes!! The whole thing is edible. I NEED to find it in a store. There was surprisingly a lot of lobster too. I just didn't like the music too much . Overall I will be back and if you want to impress someone make it your spot!
