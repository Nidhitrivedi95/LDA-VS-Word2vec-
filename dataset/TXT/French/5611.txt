3jKUbhGSjFTv5jZ0wnW0xA We discovered this bistro on a recent trip to Montreal as we were looking to have a romantic late-night dinner.  Located off a gently lively street in the trendy university section of town, the atmosphere was charming - black-and-white tiled floors, vintage French posters, and bistro tables and chairs.  We were very satisfied with our food; after some fresh bread and the Terrine de Campagne, which was surprisingly tasty with a savory mustard, pâté, and a selection of pickled vegetables including golden beets, I had the duck confit which was buttery and rich and to die for, and my boyfriend had tagliatelle, fresh and summery.  We wrapped it up with lovely crème brûlée.  The service was very quick, but again, it was around 10pm and while there were quite a few parties there, it was pretty quiet.
