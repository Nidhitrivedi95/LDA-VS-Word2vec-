D7CnTsm8SCmbQghz1ioPdw fantastic food and cocktails. .i was disappointed that i could not get reservations at my favorite resto - Joe Beef.. i have to thank the L Hotel concierge for recommending this gem around the corner from the hotel... she described it as both modern and a good example of Quebec cuisine kicked up with a contemporary twist.  gotta love when your waiter really knows the food and cocktails.  between the two of us we had the bison tartare and smoked duck to start and the boar shoulder and the quall as entrees.  sampled 2 martinis and 2 cocktails and loved them.... i forget the same but the cucumber/grape cocktail was refreshing and a makes a great spring/summer drink.  my only regret is i wish we left room for dessert!  definitely a resto to repeat in future visits..
