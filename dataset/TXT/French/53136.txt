Great spot.  Went here for the jazz, came back for the food.

Modavie is listed as one of the best jazz locations in Montreal.  We went more for the music than food.  The music was good, and they have live music every night.  You probably want to make reservations, as it can be busy, and specify for the second floor (where they have a stage) for the weekends.  Weeknights, the musicians are on the first floor.  We went both on a weeknight and a weekend.  The weeknight musicians were very good.  Original, creative, quality music.  The weekend performance was also good but, oddly, wasn't as much to my taste.

The food was very good.  I'd come back solely for the food.  A small, but good, selection of vegetarian options (can be important) and a great variety otherwise.  Prices were pretty reasonable (a little high, but not that expensive) especially considering the portion size, which was on the large side.

Finally, the staff was great.  Friendly, attentive, and personable.

A great place to go for a romantic dinner or a couple drinks and dessert.  Much better than I was expecting given the touristy nature of Vieux Montreal.
