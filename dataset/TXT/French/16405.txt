7Ym8NVxTO9b1FLGeWGp_Fg This is a new open restaurant in downtown Markham. French cuisine. We have order oyster for appetizer, steak with fries, T bone steak and lobster tail with mussels. The atmosphere is good, service is ok, they are very pack and busy and I can tell they have not hired enough experience staffs yet, but they have tried their best to serve us. The waiting time of the food is quite long, the food is just ok, the sauce of the steak and fries is bitter. I will say it is a norm for a new restaurant. There is a lot of things still need to improve.
