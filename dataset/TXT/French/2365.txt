0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g Wife and I went to this place last month.  She really wanted to trying it out due to high reviews from yelp.  Therefore, we make the reservation for dinner at 7:00pm.  It took us about 10 minutes to find this place inside bellagio.  Server greeted us nicely and took us to our table which is a patio facing the water fountain.  Extremely nice view.  Both of us order the course menu and turned out to be the best decision both of us ever made besides got married :) .  I strongly recommend this place if you want to spend the time of your life on a fine dinning experience with the best view on the strip.
