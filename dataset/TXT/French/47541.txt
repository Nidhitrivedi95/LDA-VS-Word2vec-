O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q I read reviews before we went and did not expect any good services. We just wanted to have seat in the patio for Sunday brunch to celebrate birthday. The hostess did not  have eye contact or smile but our server Natalie was very nice and we had good time. Food was okay, nothing special.
