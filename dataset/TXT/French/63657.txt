t1mR_Zff6Dqv1TueE2JLEA over hyped, over priced. If you're going for the novelty of the belly dancing find a different place with better food.

Dinner was mediocre (bordering on just plain bad). Food tasted like it was sitting in a buffet table tray all day and warmed up to be served. I think this place is a giant tourist trap for its novelty (atmosphere etc.)
