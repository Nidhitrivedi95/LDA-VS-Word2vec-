jSfnItqaOnEp2nenVF7fCg This place is as good as it gets.  The paninis are excellent with rich flaovors and ravishing ingredients.  You can definitely tell the difference with taste and food quality from a chef.  The restaurant has a nice pleasant atmosphere.  What a gem in Surprise.  Highly recommend it.
