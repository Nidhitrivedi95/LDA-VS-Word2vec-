UeyTFWMLCopiZQ9ZIfmXfA From my preivous dining experience with ici before, I knew how hard it was to book a table. Now that they moved to Windsor arms hotel, they made it even more difficult! Reservation section on their website says "under construction", their phone number is "not in service/not assigned"; I had to called the hotel & asked them to transfer me to the restaurant. Had to took one star away because of that. 

First impression when I walked in is that the place is very very quiet. Unlike their old site, they hid their kitchen away, couldn't see chefs cooking anymore. Half of the food items were gone from their old menu. Steak tartare is tasty as before; potatoes were crispy, tartare itself was fresh. Beef carpaccio was a bit disappointing as it was too salty. We also shared the grill platter. Beef was cooked to perfection, chicken was moist, fried calamari was crunchy. Last but not least, souffle!!!!! It was so light and fluffy! Yum!

Will come back for their tartare and souffle again!
