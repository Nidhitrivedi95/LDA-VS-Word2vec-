i5vxtyiHKYnRcJ0p9N7mLw Fantastic little Italian deli in the most inconspicuous
location. The butternut squash ravioli was delicious and would strongly recommend it. The pesto chicken sandwich was also very tasty. My son had the meatball sandwich and his verdict was "best ever"! 
We also had a slice of the homemade triple chocolate cake which was outstanding as well. Will be back again soon.
