rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w Had a very good experience at La Cirque but it was not life changing, as I had been led to believe.  They offer different menu options (as well as a la carte).  All of the courses were excellent and presented beautifully but only one was incredibly memorable, a meat course wrapped in kohlrabi.  Again, a great meal but not one of my best ever.
