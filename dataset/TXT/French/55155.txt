rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Been here a number of times and love it.. the food is great, the service normally so and that would mean five stars normally 
However a waiter or waitress can ruin the dining experience and the whole evening and that was what happened last night .. hence a 2 star! 
Waited and waited and waited for the waitress to take our order.. all the time she was talking with some other guest.. 10 minutes later still waiting and we asked another waiter about taking our order.. he told our waitress and still she talked that he had to go back again to tell her. 
That meant when she came to our table she had attitude.. bad attitude.
Not once did she check on how our food was, once it arrived. but all the while talking to other guests
We eat here every time we come to Vegas and this is the first time it's been so bad.. go and enjoy but hopefully you won't get this waitress 
Staying at the Venetian and love it but so disappointed with dinner tonight
