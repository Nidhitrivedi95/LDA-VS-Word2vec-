Dcj69NZJnbJhK-YHP_nULA Yet another entree in Madison's ever-expanding "locally-grown-fare" venues, Brasserie V has been around long enough to establish itself as a leading contender in face of up-and-comers like Graze and Nostrano. My experience here was along the lines of "come for the beer, stay for the food", in that the menu is of mixed interest. By and large, you're going to choose between sandwiches or entrees. The former consists of variations on a theme usually involving some combination of avocados and aioli. Certainly fresh and tasty, but not great. Entrees are of the rustic, comfort-food variety. I had the pork belly with cheddar mash and peanut sauce . . . very flavorful but the pork was a little dry. The hit of the evening was the beefy Carbonnade Flamande, quite tender and succulent. The frites here are renowned, but I found them overly salty and far from the melt-in-your-mouth delights you get at Graze. 

But the star here is the beer list, the most complete (to the point of overwhelming) selection of Belgian ales anywhere in Madison. And for those intimidated by such esoterica, there are still plenty of local brews to choose from (the Oso Wisconsin porter I had was delicious). Atmosphere on a Saturday night was crowded and boisterous; obviously a lot of neighborhood regulars hold this place in high esteem. We'll want to go back, particularly for the burgers, but I'm still looking for the perfect farm-fresh venue in Madison.
