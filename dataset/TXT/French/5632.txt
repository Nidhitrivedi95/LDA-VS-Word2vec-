3jKUbhGSjFTv5jZ0wnW0xA Best meal I've ever had! The atmosphere suits us so well! We were just visitors to Montreal and were looking for fine food but with a relaxing atmosphere. The food is divine and not too expensive! I ordered the duck confit, DH ordered the lamb shank. Both great! The soup of the day was a cold soup and suits the hot day very well. The duck confit comes with a squash sauce, just PERFECT. Not too salty not too sweet, just a little bit. The lamb shank comes with mushrooms and mashed potato, the combination is just divine. We sat outside in the sunset, with music performers just across the street. It's a memorable night. The waiters are very busy but they are cute with a French accent.
