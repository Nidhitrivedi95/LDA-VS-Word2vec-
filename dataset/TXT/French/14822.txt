5fquJHY2hMX9tPRD5s0t5g I had dinner at Rooster's uptown last night and if the wait had not been so long, I would give 5 stars. We had reservations for 8 for weeks but when we arrived, our table was not ready. We waited 30 minutes to be seated and I waited another 20 before I was asked if I wanted a drink. There was also a long wait for appetizers and an even longer wait for dinner. The food however was to die for. I had the fried oysters that melted in my mouth for appetizer. For my entree I had the salmon with wilted spinach and onion rings. All three items were A+++. I didn't have dessert because I was so full but the menu looked great. The wait absolutely should not have been so long on a Tuesday night but I have to say the food was absolutely worth it!
