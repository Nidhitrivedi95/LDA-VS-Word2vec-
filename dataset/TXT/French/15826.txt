6GCbZASjMnAPYBWLc_z30g This has been a tradition for a couple of years now.  A few of the twin moms get together for breakfast around  10am after shopping or volunteering at the big consignment semi-annual sale we have each april and october.  This year, I did not volunteer or shopped, however I couldn't pass up this tradition.  I love to hang out with my girlfriends at any opportunity I get.  This year the group was a little smaller, however we always have a great time.  Of course, I had to have the mimosa flight.  Mimi's is always consistent and very accommodating.  Yes, it is a chain, but service is always friendly and the food is food, although always too much.  This branch is a little farther for me, so I will see you back in October.
