2gUbgbdJ7IFSbicBXlSchw Came here with an out of town friend because we wanted an authentic Montreal bistro experience. From the moment we walked through the doors and were promptly escorted to our table we experienced nothing short of fabulous service. I ordered the sorrel soup and mushroom ravioli. The sorrel soup was so sorrely and smooth. Very green, delicious addition and not too rich. The mushroom ravioli was a real hit. Wonderful thin pasta in a glorious sauce. I sopped up as much as I could with the bread I saved to do just that. We couldn't resist truffles and coffee to round it all off. And under 50$ are you kidding me? Very reasonable prices for such a great meal.
