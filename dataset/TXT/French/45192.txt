mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q I mean wow, it's like going to museum to eat. Foie Gras was huge amazing and well prepared. We experienced almost everything on the menu and had zero complaints. The cheese shot they have will blow your mind, mashed potatoes where the best I've ever had...to die for. Kobe steak melted in my mouth! Service was impeccable.
