7Ug8zCmY6iDTewxWqeYQ2g Fantastic is an understatement. 5 stars is too little. The service was great, the food was phenmomal. From the bread and butter to the soup to the dessert. Every bite it better than the last one. Their cold melon soup was so flavorful. The main course changes every time you go but it seems like the quality never changes. I look forward to going back! The creme brûlée is a must have!!!
