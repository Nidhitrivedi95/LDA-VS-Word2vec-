aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw I've actually been trying to come here since the last time I visited Las Vegas but it always seem to be closed when I tried to go. I FINALLY WENT! They had so many different pastries and baked goods to choose one. It took me a while to decide on the Better Nutter (reinvented nutter butter) and a tropezienne (not really sure if that's spelled correctly). My boyfriend got the strawberry croissant and the pain au chocolat.

 I really enjoyed the Better Nutter. It was very tasty, and brought back the memories of eating Nutter Butters but SOOOOO MUCH BETTER. I'd definitely come back for these =] highly recommended

The tropezienne is like a bready pastry with cream in the middle, there was also strawberry slices in it. It was good but if I could only choose one I'd go for the Better Nutter.

I also tried the strawberry croissant, and that was very tasty also.

Overall, I'll be coming back to Bouchon on my next visit to Las Vegas
