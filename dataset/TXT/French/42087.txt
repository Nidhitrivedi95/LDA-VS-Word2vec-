Kut9tVbDX_f7qKMRRoXg3w Visited this place for the second time when I was in Montreal in August. I went for the first time in October after hearing marvelous things about the charcuterie (I was on a charcuterie kick at the time). My friend, Jason and I split the charcuterie plate with foie gras as well as a cheese plate (large portions--we had left overs). We both loved it! This time when I came, I got the charcuterie plate and a cronut (caramel). The charcuterie plate had changed a bit-- a couple items were replaced with new things. There was one "deli" style meat that I was now a fan of. Other than that I loved everything! There was a new ginger bread that they served with the foie grad that I was obsessed with. The combination was perfect! I also thoroughly enjoyed my cronut. They were a trend in the states for a bit, but sort of died out, so when I saw them on the menu, I knew I had to get one. It did not disappoint. The one negative thing I have to say is that the service did not seem to be super great/consistent. My service personally was fine, but there were people who came in after me and were made to wait before even being greeted by a hostess (they stood awkwardly in the doorway for 10 minutes with only 5-6 of the tables in the restaurant being occupied). The restaurant itself is cute and quaint and I'll definitely be back for my charcuterie next time I'm in town!
