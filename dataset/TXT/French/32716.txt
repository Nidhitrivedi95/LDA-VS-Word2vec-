h_ypoQ2rmwX8UGSmohsGiQ I don't come here as often anymore as the service is standoffish most days and the initial hype has worn off.

There is still a soft spot in my heart for those gooey, fresh baked Maman cookies which are always consistently delicious.

The lavender hot chocolate was disappointing and not as fragrant as it sounds.

The loaf cakes, especially the pistachio loaf is very heavy and greasy. It wasn't a moist, buttery texture but a dense, greasy slab with an oily after-taste.

Many other places nearby that do better salads.
