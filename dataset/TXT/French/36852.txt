ImGV3P_qCPnPk7-Vw56HFg Café Joe or Café Slow as some call it is simply GREAT!  The food is delicious and inexpensive and I don't mind the slow service because I know what I'm getting into when I sit down. Plus, having time to sip your coffee and discuss with your friends without having a waiter rushing you is how brunches should be enjoyed!  Try to nab one of the picnic tables on a nice summer day. :)
