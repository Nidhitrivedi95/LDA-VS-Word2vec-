I spent a while trying to figure out a good reason to go here.

I mean, the food's unspectacular.   The ambiance is kinda played-out.   The portions are smallish.  There really isn't much selection.  It's very expensive for what it is.

But... they do have a really cool fluorescent alphabet sign on the wall.   

It's what suckered us inside in the first place.... and ended up being the most memorable thing about our meal.    It's really quite wonderful.  All of the letters are there.   You can combine them to spell any word.

While this neon-induced do-it-yourself wheel-of-fortune fantasyland can take you so far, in the end you're left hungry and unsatisfied.

BL_H.    

I'd like to buy a vowel, please.
