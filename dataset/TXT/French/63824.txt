T4g4k2OhCTsiqcP-ZXElHQ Queen West location:  So wanted to like this place but unfortunately it was only mediocre.  Too bright a room, "electronic" music is an odd choice, nice but inelegant service (more suited to a concept like Milestones, etc.) and underwhelming food (french onion soup had mere "bits" of cheese, frites were only okay, steak was only okay, etc.).
