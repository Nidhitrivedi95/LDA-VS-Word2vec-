rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Ok... it's basically become a tradition to have at least one meal at Bouchon each time we go to Vegas. We've always gone to dinner and this time's experience was no different - just delicious and fun. On our waiter's suggestion, we came back for the weekend brunch and all three boys went for the chicken and waffle breakfast. My breakfast americaine was super delicious - but, yeah... their chicken and waffles won HANDS DOWN. OMG it was SO good.
