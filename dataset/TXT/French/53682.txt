I was really trying to eat slow and savor it, but it was SO GOOD, I just kinda devoured it ....and this is when I wasn't that hungry to begin with.  After the first bite of braised rib, after I said that it was good and offered some to my boyfriend to try, I didn't speak until I finished that rib.  How embarrasing!!  HAhaha.... Beautiful, romantic location.  Perfectly prepared and plated.
