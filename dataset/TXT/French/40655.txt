KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA Well honestly after been to many French restaurant in different places... this is the worst experience I have ever had.... almost zero service ( not sure if it is becuz we are Asian...) my server checked on the table during we having the main course n she asked if we got the appetizer yet... really... food also not so enjoyable. N I won't recommend the escargot... even someone who could not cook may did better job than that. Anyway I won't deny the view is very nice but really won't give this place a second chance.
