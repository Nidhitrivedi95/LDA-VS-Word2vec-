USleI8g1UVN9-9jm-b4uIg I had really high expectations about this place so maybe I'm being a bit unfair with only 3 stars. 

The good:
The ambience is very unique and unlike most any place in Charlotte. It's very cozy and romantic. The level of service and just the correct amount of attention was superb. The drinks and wine were very good. Some of the food was unbelievably good and some was just not seasoned well.

The bad:
Well the reason I want to dine in establishments such as this is mainly for the food. The food was inconsistent from start to finish yet it's one of the more expensive places I've been.

Foie gras and stuffed calamari for apps...both were ok but nothing special. For the price charged I felt it lacked greatness.

Filet...one of the best ever tasted. Sides were unbelievable. Grouper and lobster...grouper and risotto were under seasoned. The lobster was really good.

Beignets...really good and had French press coffee to finish the evening.

Bottom line is that we paid a steep price for an inconsistent meal. The parts that were good were extremely good.
