The ambiance is a classic no frills steakhouse - clean white table cloths and pictures of the restaurant team over the years on the wall. The meal begins with an incredible fresh baguette and the cutest tiniest pickles I've ever seen. I got the steak frites and my friends also got the beef tartare and salmon. All were incredible, and the pepper crusting on the steak was to die for. 

We also had a refreshing rose, and finished off with delicious cappuccinos. Great meal and would definitely recommend for anyone looking for French flavors!
