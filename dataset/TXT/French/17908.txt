A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g Just went there again for breakfast and the service was as delightful as ever. Got another Croque Madame, and the Ham/cheese quiche. I've never had quiche before and this was amazingly delightful! I really love this place. 

On the way out we got a few macarons (chocolate, vanilla, and pumpkin), the chocolate pecan tart, and the something that started with an M and was next to the tiramisu, had grand marnier in it. The M something was good but I am not a fan of alcohol in my dessert and I could taste it, but it was very chocolatey and the texture was moist/wet and heavenly.
