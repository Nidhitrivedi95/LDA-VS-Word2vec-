If you know the difference between chain Italian and really quality Italian; if your bar is higher than almost any place you can find in the Phoenix metro area because you know better--this is the place for you. This is not fine dining atmosphere, but deli with a friendly European bistro vibe. We met Emilie, one of the owners, who took our order and delivered the food. She was charming, authentic, passionate and, well, European. A delight! Sandwiches were best we have had in maybe 20 years (both lived in NJ/NY), lasagna was sublime, not as heavy as we have been led to believe it has to be and with a simple, rustic, yet uniquely balanced flavor profile. My wife claimed the tiramisu was as good as she has ever had. A complete gem of a find in an otherwise desert (get it?) of good food.
