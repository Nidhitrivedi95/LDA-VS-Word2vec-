Jbl6p9CVkfCB8fWYFd2-Qw Club Isabella is my new favorite spot. Last nights meal fused flavors & techniques   igniting romantic food memories of meals past. We found ourselves comparing this meal with our all time best dinning experiences on the road and in our hometown .  Club Isabella
competes for top spot.  We started with the cuttlefish, tender & crispy we loved the sweet & spicy sauce making it an instant hit. Next we worked our way through the charcuterie assortment. Its nice to see the attention to detail & technique. This was old world done right,only to be interrupted by the house cured salmon gravlox. The microgreen & arugula salad  popped with a pickled cherry vinaigrette, building excitement to our entrees arrival. We ordered the specials for dinner, Chef Fabio did not disappoint. Crab stuffed lobster tail served over creamy barley risotto & pheasant prepared 2 ways. We finished our meal with the Basil Panna Cotta & coffee. We drove home trying to remember the last time we had a meal this good. This was a night to remember & we will be back.
