UxWH8zRYIBgs6Q2oykvRdw When I walked in immediately loved the design. It was a very nice place for special occasions. Me and a friend ordered the french onion soup, oysters, steak frites, and fried seafood mix with fries. 

The French onion soup was nice. I loved the huge puff pastry on top. The oysters were good too. However, I was disappointed with the mains. The steak was alright, it wasn't bad but I wasn't impressed. The fried seafood didn't come out crispy. They left it in the kitchen too long before bringing it out to me. It was pretty bad considering it is a higher end restaurant. I will probably not return for authentic French cuisine.
