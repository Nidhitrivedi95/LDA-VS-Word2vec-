pKiSzUlBBRNEdTML24piXA I have seen this place before as it's near a coffee shop that I go to quite often (it has a life-size Centurion outside of it that catches your attention) so when I saw it featured on groupon, I thought it would be a great time to finally try it out.

BIG MISTAKE!!!

I don't know if they have had bad experiences with coupon sites but they REALLY make it known that they would not like your business if you have purchased a discount online.  There's also a sign on the door to remind you that any discounts you might have are not really welcome here.

Ok, I'll forget about my $15 voucher if it takes an act of congress to use it, I'll just pay full price so I can eat here without going through all the red tape. Many fellow Yelpers love this place so I'll give it shot. Y-U-C-K.

The first thing I noticed with the smell of grease. Strike two, Centurion. Let's have a look at the menu. Whoa. A little sticker shock, but what the heck it's gotta be good.  It's not. I tried the fish stew and it did not taste fresh at all. Ok, maybe the España Pizza will be good.  The Chorizo was nice and spicy but the Manchego tasted off-- way off and was not sweet tasting at all.

The Brunch menu does look pretty good and if I were to ever go back it would be to try that.
