uP3H5bcsiTXM0k0xQhRndg I don't even know how to start. Everything is perfect!! Deciding to eat here was the best decision I made during my stay in Montreal. Location is easy to find, decor is absolutely beautiful, staff members are extremely friendly, and omg the food. Apparently everything is locally sourced and homemade. The portions are HUGE but my sister and I ate EVERYTHING. We got the spinach salad that had warm goat cheese on top and a grilled cheese with mango dipping sauce. So good.
