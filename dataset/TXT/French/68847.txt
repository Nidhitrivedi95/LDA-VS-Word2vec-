VSPft3RUXDE8HnX6Anvbvg It was my first and obviously last time there as it was one of the worst dining experiences I ever had in Montreal. The atmosphere is pleasant and the interior is nicely done but the rest is pretty awful. The stuff was arrogant and almost rude. It was hard to find anything decent on the menu. (Everything they had was quite exotic and French fusion). The portions were incredibly tiny and my main dish (goat meat) was something weird and not even tasty. The waiter took away the first bottle of wine before it ended. It was $200 for two but I left hungry and very disappointed.
