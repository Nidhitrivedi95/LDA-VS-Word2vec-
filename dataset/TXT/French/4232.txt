We were on a family vacation, and I remembered an Anthony Bourdain episode where he ate here. I checked the Yelp reviews and made a reservation, which I highly recommend as far in advance as you know.

Everything was wonderful, appetizers, salad, and entrees. A few bottles of wine and a lot of money, but worth it for a true Montreal experience.
