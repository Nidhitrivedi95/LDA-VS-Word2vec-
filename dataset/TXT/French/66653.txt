uP3H5bcsiTXM0k0xQhRndg Ate here on our first day. It is tiny but so worth the visit. Staff was very courteous and warm with just the right level of attentiveness.

My server let me taste the wine I was ordering first which was refreshing.

Our soup du jour was excellent. There was bread, I think, it was so good we gobbled it up!

We realized, after our food arrived that we preferred the others main course so we switched. I ended up with the delicious Mac and cheese with ham that was more like sweet pork tenderloin. My associate had the quiche and was very happy with it.

We were too full for dessert but wish we had room. They all sounded very tasty.

What shines here is the staff. Food can be average to excellent anywhere but it is the folks who are professional and friendly that make you want to return. We will!
