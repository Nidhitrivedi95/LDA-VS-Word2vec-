P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ Truly an experience you'll never forget.  YES, it costs about $400/person for the full tasting menu WITHOUT wine.  YES - it takes hours to finish.  YES - it will be one of the best meals of your life.  
Some highlights:
1) Artichoke soup served with truffled butter brioche.  Ok, the soup was great.  It's Monsieur Savoy's signature dish.  But, that piece of brioche was the best thing I've ever eaten.  Take a nice piece of brioche, then your waiter spreads a truffled butter on top.  Grab it while it's nice and warm and eat.  Rich, truffly, and delicious.  
2) Lobster with carrot puree.  I'm actually NOT a lobster fan.  Yup.  I said it.  But this was unbelievable.  Normally lobster is tough - not this.  And paired with the sweetness of the carrot I found the lobster to actually be tasty rather than the blandness I associate with lobster.  Yup - bland.  But this was great.
3) Colors of Caviar - pure goodness.  Come in a little serving cup and you can see layers of different goodness in there.  I don't remember what exactly was in there beyond caviar and some kind of creamy sauce.  But it was wonderful.
4) Their Cheeses - great selection.  One of the ones we chose was a blue cheese so strong I could only take a small bite alongside the fruit and bread that came with it.  We were already stuffed so didn't appreciate this as much as we should have.
5) Their breads with salted and unsalted butter.  Seriously, this could have been the meal by itself.  I remember a walnut bread as well as a cranberry bread that was just amazing.  And served with the best butter I've ever had.  
Service is impeccable.  It's over 10 courses but you get new silverware each time.  Make sure you know what the Prestige Menu costs before ordering - with tax and tip you need to spend over $400.
