xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g Celebrated our anniversary here, made reservations and asked for a table with the bellagio fountain views. Hostesses were nice informed us it would be a few more minutes so we got a drink at the bar, very pricey drinks but they did have my favorite bleu cheese stuffed olives. Finally seated and they did honor my request for the fountain view, such a romantic spot. Our server greeted us an older gentleman but right away we could tell he was snobby and looked down at us since we were a young couple. Just brushed him off, for a starter we had the scallops, so delicious served with baby carrots and a  puree that I can't remember but oh man so good! For dinner I had the filet while my husband had the ny strip with bone marrow, to share we also ordered asparagus, mushroom & spinach along with pommes rissolees, these fried potatoes. Everything except the potatoes was delicious!  Just melt in your mouth delicious. Steaks were cooked perfectly, we were so stuffed. i dont know why my husband ordered a warm apple strudel because our server brought us an anniversary dessert which I noted in our reservations and we were in a food coma after that. I highly recommend this spot for a romantic dinner. Be prepared to spend some money but its worth every penny.
