hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA Great food and service.
Comparable to the real french bakery in France. (I've been to France twice and had eaten around)

I found this little french cafe from yelp and it was worth driving!!!
We got fresh squeezed orange juice, croissant, pain de chocolate, raisin danish, and 1 cappuccino and ice coffee.
Olivier, who took our order shake ice coffee with milk n sugar as if it was a cocktail. WOW!!
He served the drinks with attention and it was almost artistic.
All of the drinks and food were AMAZING.
My mom was really happy to see the little straw art.
Olivier is french and I enjoyed a little french conversation with him.
He was really really sweet.

I had an amazing breakfast there.
I am sooooo going back next time I go to Vegas.
Please open one in LA?lol

Merci beaucoup.
