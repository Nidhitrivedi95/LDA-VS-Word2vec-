udFcIcbWbxrO8uLF95WnQg Visited this restaurant by chance after the theater.  We had rushed from work to our show and were starving by the time it was over.  The whole experience was really awful.  The staff was lethargic and acted like a bunch of zombies.  I understand that it was late, but when working a later shift you still have to provide upbeat service.  The food was really lack luster at best and the overall atmosphere was that of a morgue.  We were one of two couples in the area where we were seated and when they left the place was silent and the servers disappeared.  It was borderline creepy.  Never again.
