O3OH5IEFMPtz7mPKakPZ3Q This place is a gem. So many reasons for me to come back here!

Here are the delicious items that I sampled last night:

Truffle bone marrow 
Uni bites
Fried rice
Salmon belly ceviche
Banana harumaki
Iced green tea

The bone marrow was such a treat and the truffle oil complimented it very nicely. It was also very nice of them to throw an extra bone in because it normally comes with two and the batch they had were too small. The salmon belly ceviche was so fresh tasting. Salmon can get a very fishy smell or taste and it absolutely did not have any of that. The fried rice was delicious and I really dug their special fried rice that has a combo of all three meats, in case you cannot choose just one! The banana harumaki was just amazing. Warm and gooey banana on the inside with the hint of heat from the dusted cayenne pepper. 

The chef even checked on us and asked us if we wanted some extra wonton chips for our dish. You can tell that he has a try passion for the restaurant business. This place also has amazing service. Super attentive and willing to answer any questions. I also really liked that every time our waitress dropped off a dish, it wasn't just a dash and go. She explained all the parts of the dish and the best way to eat it (such as with the dessert, that if you move it around on the plate, you will catch more of that cayenne pepper). 

A little tip: at this time, it is bring your own bottle! No corkage fee! This may change once they have a liquor license though. I also looked at that happy hour and reverse happy menu. I will definitely be back with a bottle of wine and an appetite to dive into their amazingly-priced little happy hour bites.
