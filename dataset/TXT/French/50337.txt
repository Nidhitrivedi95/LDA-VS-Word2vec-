ovtlrcsVRlgZZQUlHs_ovw If I could give this place 0 stars I would. 
Everything from the food to the service was lacking. 
I ordered the Waldorf salad with salmon. The salmon was decent but the salad was plain, and dry. I would have probably been able to get more dressing, to liven it up a little if our waitress would have checked on us even once. 
I am a server. I have been for 8 years. I am understand and patience, I understand being busy. But come on... Our wine took 10 minutes to arrive to the table and our food took atleast 20-25min... And not once were we checked on. 
My date and I each finished our first glass of wine before we were done eating but were never asked if we would like another glass. 
The reason people go out to eat is to get served, to have someone wait on them... And our waitress was a disgrace. 
We were planning on having an evening out together, lots of drinks, dessert, and good food. 
My dates steak was good, small and expensive, the Mac and cheese was dry. 
I will never return to this place nor recommend it to anyone.
