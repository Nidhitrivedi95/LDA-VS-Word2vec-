mT8Ej8sKFJoIa5G0Vl4AKA Food was edible. I guess in Canada everyone eats their burgers med well because we were not asked. Veggie sandwich very sparse on veggies and only one side with goat cheese. Early evening and out of sweet potato fries. Food slow to come out of kitchen. Perhaps the barbecue is better but would not return to find out as no redeeming features to make me want to try again.
