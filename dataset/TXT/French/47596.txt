O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q Came here with family last week. We loved it so much and our waiter (I can't remember his name). 

We ordered the wine of the week, which was a Rose', and started of with a dozen of their oysters YUM. Service was fast and the bread was warm and fresh. Our table shared the Caesar salad (prepared at our table). 

I had the Seafood Fettuccine. It was perfect. They actually gave me more seafood than noodles. A plus. My dad ordered the Fillet Mignon with crab and asparagus cooked medium rare and my mom had the Salmon with lentils. Everything was perfect and we would come here again.
