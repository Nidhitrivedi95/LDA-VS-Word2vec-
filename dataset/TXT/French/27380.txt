dgiJTIKS1QYTW2gFyK2X7A Ahhh. I can't forget about this place. Of all the Montreal restaurants we could've gone to, my boyfriend and I chose this place because this place serves tongue and it stood out from the rest. Plus tongues are delicious, so I knew this was the place to go. 

We ordered an appetizer to share, which was grilled cauliflower (Chou-fleur grillé, 1608, amandes, truffe), and it was creamy and flavorful. You can taste the grilled charness of the cauliflower, while the puree complemented it as you combined them together. Absolutely delightful, so we finished that up nicely. 

Then we both got the Bison Tongue (Langue de bison grillée, crème de thon, maïs, câpres et citron) as our main course. I've had tongues before but this dish had the softest, most delicate texture. The heaviness of the meat was well balanced with the radish, capers, and lemon. The cream was very delicious as well. Was it really made out of tuna, I wonder...

Price wise, I thought it was fair, and quite generous with the serving. Really impressed! I also oversaw a French couple enjoying their dinner, and I really want to come back to try what they were eating. So Le St-Urbain, I'll be back...I'll be back.
