Fd25lEnclIwyWlSRgkbRfg I expected more from the food and the service. 
Scallops were bland, and none of the meat dishes was done to the preparation level required - the steak was too dry, the lamb was too raw.
The service was terrible - the french waiter is a nice gimmick but he got my order wrong and part of  my partner's food wasn't served until we commented on that. As a result we had our meal one at a time which was disappointing.
Never going back.
