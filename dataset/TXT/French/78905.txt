The hostess asked the waitress on the way to our table if it was ok to sit us there and she was very bothered by it.  After that the service was TERRIABLE!  The food was alright, we had lunch the triple decker club and the ruben.  The potato salad was delicous!  prices were very reasonable in my opinion especially compared to the other casinos it came to 30 for both lunches and drinks.  The best part of this place is sitting on the "patio" where youa re in the casino so you feel like you're outdoors, especially if you enjoy the Paris.

I know most people don't really take kids to Vegas, but we were just on a quick day trip so we did have my son and there is no kids meal just as an FYI they do however have high-chairs.

Over all the place isn't a total loss but I think we'll try someplace else our next trip.
