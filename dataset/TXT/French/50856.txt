oZHbPhIj01_31jqD053a_Q My husband and I came here to celebrate our ten-year anniversary after a recommendation by our hotel concierge.   Words simply cannot express how wonderful our experience was.  The dinner was without a doubt the highlight of our entire week in Montreal.

We splurged and both had the tasting menu, which is an absolute steal at under $100 each.  Throughout the meal we kept commenting on what a great deal we were getting!  Eating at Europea is a total experience - it is not just a culinary experience; it is also completely entertaining in every way!  Starting with the food: it was absolutely delicious, everything we had.  I just kept saying to myself, "I didn't know my tastebuds could feel this way!!" But on top of that, it was so creative.  Each piece brought out was a work of art.  We had just as much fun discovering what was next as we did eating it!  The waiters are also courteous and humorous, and I laughed out loud on many occasions.  Months later, we are still raving about our experience to everyone.  We could not recommend Europea more highly!
