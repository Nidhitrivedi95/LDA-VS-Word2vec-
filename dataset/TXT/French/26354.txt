D7CnTsm8SCmbQghz1ioPdw My wife, dad, and step-mom thoroughly enjoyed L'Original! I wish I could remember our waiter's name, because he was the best waiter I have ever had. He was patient and explained just about everything on the menu to us. He even recommended a bar for after dinner - and it was the same bar he was going to! You'd think the last place wait staff want to be is where their clients are going.

But I digress... The food was AMAZING. My dad ate the boar (one of the specials) and loved it. My surf and turf was great, but I wished I'd had the boar. Get that if it is on the menu. For dessert, I had the blueberry cobbler. I was disappointed only because I was forced to share it. Definitely the place to go in Montreal!
