KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA The bad: Seems like the kitchen had a little trouble with our entrees.  I ordered the duck and the skin was not crispy and the meat was cold.  My friend ordered the chicken breast and I tried some of her dish and it was dry and overcooked - hard to swallow.  The child's french fries were also cold and over-salted.  The countertops leading to the table were filthy - needs to be wiped down.

The good: The scallop and oyster apps were delicious. Our servers were attentive.
