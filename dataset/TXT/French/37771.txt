jaSowNITPRRCYpPb3_pjdA Love so many things about this place. So so happy that Andre decided to open a Bistro in the neighborhood! Love the quotes on the windows, interior is warm and comfortable. Staff is friendly and knowledgeable. Now... onto the food... the punch is so so good! Steak frites, the muscles!!!! Everything is amazing! The lemon tart is my favorite...
