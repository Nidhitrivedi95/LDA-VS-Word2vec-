FRuuIDOd21pTJHvEGIt1Gg An Old Montreal favorite, Holder is a beautiful French bistro that is always perfectly crowded. One of my faves is the Duck Confit with the truffle oil arugula salad. My friends are huge fans of the Steak tartar. This place is perfect for a big or small group gathering with friends. It's casual but trendy, so feel free to wear jeans with heels or your pretty little black dress.
