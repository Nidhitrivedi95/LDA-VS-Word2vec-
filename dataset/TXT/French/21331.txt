B56AYe5GNuavMDtwFsXqzA I am horrified it took me so long to review this - it took me a few months to track down Chris Porter's new place last year.  Having found it, I took my wife there for her birthday in early January, 2010.

Not the extravaganza of the old Tapino.  But the gastronomic delights didn't diminish in the slightest.

The old homestead is perfectly suited to the simpler menu.

To paraphrase a Hannibal Lecter line [another gastronome, come to think of it], our world is a richer place for Chris Porter's continued presence in it.
