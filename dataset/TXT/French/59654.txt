The food was excellent to say the least! I ordered the eggs Benedict that was well plated and made with their own twist. Their potatoes were phenomenal. My fiancé ordered the chilled tomato soup and was completely satisfied. 
The price is very right for brunch. 
We plan on coming back for their evening selection and have already decided this is our favorite spot for date night!
