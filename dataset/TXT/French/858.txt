_cjPEH9wXhKS-HQe_U3M4Q We came in for dinner at 7:30pm with a reservation and was seated promptly. Our waitress came right away and got us our drinks. We ordered the bison steak tartare. I've never had steak tartare before but I have some damn high expectations now since this was absolutely so tasty and very well seasoned. The seasoning didn't overwhelm and brought the taste and texture of the bison out. It was garnished with crushed pistachios and came with a plate of fries. These fries were DA BOMB. OMG. They were like McDonald's fries but 100 times better because, you know, they were real potatoes...

We also got the charcuterie platter that had assorted cured meats such as in house smoked ham, salami, pates, and they gave us a jar of small pickles that they make in house and it was awesome.

I ordered the roasted fresh Alberta leg of lamb with a lemon and rosemary jus. It was super tasty but for $34.95 I was like "oh..." You get what you pay for. It came with very delicious potatoes and veggies. I was very satisfied.

My friends all got the 8 oz centre cut steak filet with a green peppercorn sauce with Brandy and cream with fries ($29.95). If you thought the fries were da bomb, this sauce that came with their steaks was AH-MAY-ZING! Exclaimation point and everything. They all asked for more sauce. I don't believe we were charged extra.

We were all feeling gluttonous so desserts it is! We all got ourselves a creme brulee. Oh my word, this was fantastic. So thick. It was $11.95 each.

If I had all the monies in the world, this is one of the places I would go to on a regular basis. I absolutely love this place. My bill with my friend came up to around $125. Pricey but so worth it.
