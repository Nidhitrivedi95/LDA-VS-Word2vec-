2. The ribs served on a bed of mac & cheese are spectacular. A trip to this restaurant, purely for this particular dish, is mandatory.

3. Friendly and attentive service, always. I've never caught them on an off night.

I'd always recommend skipping this restaurant - and every other restaurant in downtown Toronto - during summerlicious.
