WOd8tWsh2Yt_osHv-ngx_w Delicious!
Woke this afternoon, my wife was having trouble finding which restaurant to go, so I YELPed it!

The breakfast/brunch is amazing and it arrived quite fast after we ordered it. Great I dying of hunger lol.

I was really pleased with the food, although I ordered the standard, easy, traditional, most simple breakfast; eggs, bacon, ham & sausage. And my love ordered the original benedict.

Service is okay, on their defence... They are really crowded and the place is all packed! With that kind of food, it makes perfect sense! :)

Price is not bad at all, roughly average $11-$13 per person with coffee and stuff.

Will go back for sure!
