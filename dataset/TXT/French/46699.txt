nkHaix6KenApS8M-liZsCQ Absolutely wonderful experience here. We stopped in before a show to have an early dinner. We sat at the bar and tried a bunch of items of their tasting menu. The foie gras was deliciously rich and paired perfectly with the wonderful bread they served. Christopher suggested the steak au poivre and it was cooked perfectly medium rare with a great crust, the sauce complimented it nicely. This was probably my favorite dish we had. The  escargot  was delicious and the addition of the puff pastry on top was an great decision. The blood sausage was as good as any I've had and the puff pastry was astounding. The star of the meal for my wife was the dessert. She got the  mousse tower and absolutely loved it. 

Overall we had a great dining experience and will definitely be going back. We suggest you get a seat at the bar because watching them prepare these great meals is a time.
