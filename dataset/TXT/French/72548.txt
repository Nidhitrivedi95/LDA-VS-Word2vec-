XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q A major disappointment...

The only good thing about this restaurant is the service. Thank goodness for the professional waiters who excelled the experience. I am certain Mr. Robuchon is not cooking in the back.

As a French person born and raised on this cuisine...i can ascertain that this is not the cuisine culture I experienced growing up. However this is not important...great chefs leave their mark regardless of whether or not they are not in the kitchen. The food was not horrible but extremely average.

This restaurant is for people who are not familiar with good cuisine who feel the need to flush dollars down the toilet.
