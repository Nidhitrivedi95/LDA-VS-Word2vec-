-uGMZNvGu7gsrOaUMAmf_A What a great little find near old Montreal. Pleasant and friendly staff ( who also speak English) and great ambience. Their breakfast is fresh made and ample. Excellent coffee too! There are awesome sandwiches and other tasty pastries to take along as you tour the old city. I'd highly recommend this place!.
