PlYrlj86zAYljZTRCBSZ3A I was surprised when i arrived here and the place was actually an adorable food truck, not far from Kensington Market. I ordered the traditional poutine. I had tried poutine for the first time in Montreal and was utterly disgusted. I wanted to give it another try though, and I'm glad that I did because this poutine was more than edible. Although the owner explained that his poutine was based from the traditional Montreal style since that's where poutine originated, I found his cheese, gravy, and fries to be more balanced. Good job!
