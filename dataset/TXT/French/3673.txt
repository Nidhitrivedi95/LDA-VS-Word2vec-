27vF5LESbv4kFQfHZUDCnw I think we miss ordered. I fully intend to try this trendy bakery again on our next trip to Toronto.

My fiance and I had breakfast at The Tempered Room while visiting Toronto this past weekend. Two cappuccinos, an almond croissant, a chocolate croissant, a plain croissant, and  brioche with chocolate and a jam glaze. The chocolate croissant and plain croissant were our favorite! Both light and buttery with a flakiness that was to die for, as good as any croissant we have every had here or over seas. The almond croissant and brioche were too sweet for us, however they did have salted brioche bites that probably would have been a much better choice for us. 

Trendy fun spot with an "open" bakery, easy and cheap street parking, and friendly workers. Give this one a try for your next cup of joe.
