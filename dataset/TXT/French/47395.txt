O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q The quality of the oysters kept this from being a 1 star rating.  I ordered the NY Steak medium and it came out well done.   I sent it back and when they came back with another it was bairly medium well.  The server made me cut it down the middle once the steak arrived to make sure it was "medium."  bad move, it lost all it's juices immediately and like I said it was barely medium well, but at this point I didn't care anymore cuz I was so dam hungry.  But even for a medium well NY Steak this was exrtremely tough meat for something that's supposed to be "Prime."  I've had better steaks from Sizzler and that's no exaggeration.  Whatever you do don't order the NY.  My friend ordered the filet and he had no complaints, and again the oysters were pretty dam good. 

Like others have said, you can do much better in Las Vegas especially at this price point.
