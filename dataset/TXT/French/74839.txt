Xw50tINqzrI_BM_x7_IcZA Let me just start by saying i am one of the pickiest foodies out there..very judgmental when it comes to food. Me and my sister were looking for a spot that won't make me complain after and boy did we fall in love not just with the food and the reasonable pricing but the place has a very authentic and personal feel to it. I felt like i was in a small town in france..the chef was so sweet and welcoming makes you feel like you're at your favorite aunts house and her food has an authentic and personal touch to it. We had omelet crepes i don't remember the names but it was the chef's recommendation. it was healthy and flavorful yet light enough you don't feel like taking a nap after, instead you feel energetic and satisfied (what food is supposed to do) and we had this amazing organic lemon drink thing i don't remember the name but it was soooo good and perfect on a hot summer day. i highly recommend you try it. we need more of that in toronto..NO more chain restaurants please!
