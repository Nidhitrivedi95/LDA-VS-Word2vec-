33Tr0eRki1Yamzleu4GMdw We had a fabulous breakfast this morning at Rosallie. My wife Karen and I shared the Croque Rosallie, a croissant filled with Paris ham, sweet onion bechamel mozzarella cheese. We had them add scrambled eggs and the flavor was to die for.  For a sweet treat we had a fresh apple turnover.  Karen was excited with the amount of loose leaf tea options for hot tea.  I opted for the blended coffee and it was terrific.  Based on the food alone the Cafe deserved five stars but when you consider The ambience, I was wishing there was a sixth star option. Between the decor and the music you could close your eyes and feel like you are on a secluded corner somewhere  in France with the one you love.
