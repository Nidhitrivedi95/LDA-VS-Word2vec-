4O8fzz9F-XEsQ-gTMgkiyQ We had a great time here and the food was great. Portions are small, and it was expensive, but I felt that we got our money's worth because of the beautiful and delicious food, and great service.

My daughter's allergic to milk, so I was afraid we'd have problems with misunderstandings and cross-contamination, but the waitress was really good and spent a lot of time helping us find dishes that she wouldn't be allergic to.
