iwFoA98-OgcdXmNS0LxNOA Some people can be quick to point the finger but im going to the 3 Brewers the benefit of the doubt.  Im going to base my review on how I liked this places before I had an issues.  I will explain...shortly after I ate I began to get the sweats and was very sick to my stomach.  This comes 15 to 20 mins after eating my meal.  We were a group of 6 and I seemed to be the only one that was sick so for this reason I want to say that something just didn't agree with me.  Our server was amazing.  Quick, polite and professional.  We shared 3 apps for 6 people.  Tasty deep fried goodness.  Our entrees all came out at the same time and no one had any complaints as to how it was cooked.  It will be a while but I will visit the 3 brewers again.
