rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw Slave girl and I were looking for a place to get brunch and we found out Bardot Brasserie had brunch until 1:30pm with bottomless mimosa. Yes please. 

Bardot was beautifully decorated and very well lighted inside. The bar was very busy especially with bottomless mimosa.

We ordered steak tartare, truffle fries, French toast, and croque madame.

We started with complimentary baguette with salted butter. I know nothing about how to make butter magical, but the butter that came with was really good especially the part had salt on. I tried to use regular table salt and they just didn't taste the same. 

Steak tartare was excellent. The steak was grounded to order mixing with sauce verte and egg yolk. Severed with gaufrette potato chips. It had creamy texture and good flavor. 

Croque madame came with pain de mie, Paris ham, gruyere fondue, and a organic egg on top. It was good but it didn't wow me like the one I had in San Francisco. 

Slave girl told me the French toast was one of the best she ever had. Since I only had a bite, I would say sure, why not. It came with brioche French toast top with vanilla mascarpone, almond brittle, and organic syrup. 

Truffle fries was a bit fail in my book. Sure it was done well, but I didn't get too much of truffle flavors which defeated the purpose of "truffle" fries. 

The service here was fantastic. It was a full house but my mimosa was never empty. Matter of fact, it was filled before I even finished the glass. On top of that, our server was also training a new server too. Great job for sure. We will go back to try the dinner menu.
