pRlO48w4GkWEPEYIH2tHsw I discovered Mimi's Cafe a couple months ago, and have come back pretty much once every two weeks. I have found the best time to come is when they email you the free dinner/lunch coupon. I've tried almost all the dishes at Mimi's and have found that they all taste pretty good. My favourite dish here is the crispy chicken on spaghetti with artichokes. The portion is big, tastes great, and is pretty cheap. The chicken is always really crispy and the sauce tastes great. A real alternative to Cheesecake factory! The bread basket is also very good...I love the poppy seed bread and the walnut bread---I always ask for seconds! I'm not really a fan of the corn chowder here...its waaaaay too thick and starchy, and with too little corn. The chicken piccata has a somewhat artificial lemon taste in the sauce. For chicken piccata, better try Cheesecake Factory's. I'm glad I've discovered Mimi's Cafe!
