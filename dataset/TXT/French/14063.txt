58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw We ate here twice on a recent long weekend in Montreal. I love the food and the atmosphere. My wife found her crepes (Sunday brunch) were a little heavy. My eggs with the Mornay sauce were heavenly and came with fresh squeezed orange juice! The wait staff were also superb. Highly recommend for breakfast and brunch.
