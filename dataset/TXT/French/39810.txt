K2C8dSx9215LLcIzHL959Q Came here last Sunday after hearing rave reviews. The space is decorated simply, which is fine. Service was superb. The old fashions were perfectly prepared and the wine list included some of my favorites. My husband and I splurged on the chef's tasting menu since it came highly recommended. While everything was good, I was a little underwhelmed ( maybe because my expectations were so high). The menu was surprisingly boring- a beet dish, a salmon dish, a steak dish (among other things). It felt like an iteration of a meal I've had a thousand times before. The dry ice dessert was a fun show and it tasted like heaven but I felt like it was an attempt to  make up for something the main courses lacked- creativity.
