4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I'll admit it, I was skeptical of spending Thanksgiving at a French restaurant but WOW. When we got there the place was PACKED - there was a line streaming out into the casino. We had reservations but still had to wait just a bit but there's a nice little bar out on the patio where you can see the Bellagio fountains going off across the street. Despite being so busy, the staff was very nice and helpful through the madness. 

Everyone in our party of four opted for the $49.99 prix fixe which was the perfect Thanksgiving meal away from home. For the first, second and desert courses there were two options. For the first course I went with oysters on the half shell which were perfectly shucked and served with a mignonette sauce as well as a cocktail sauce. The other option was a dressed up version of salmon and lox on a baguette type bread. For the second course it was a choice between a salad or a butternut squash soup and let me tell you, the soup was AMAZING. Best soup ever. As I was contemplating licking my bowl for every last drop of goodness, they brought out the main entrees. In true Thanksgiving style, each person received a plate that would probably better be described as a platter, loaded with all the traditional fixings - even a small selection of both light and dark turkey meat. Two different types of potatoes, cranberry sauce, and delicious stuffing. I am typically a proud member of the clean plate club but I couldn't even come close to finishing it all. Dessert was a choice between a pecan tart and pumpkin creme brulee. Obviously we had to go with the creme brulee and it was perfection. 

It was a wonderful meal with great service and I would highly recommend it for a holiday, special occassion, or just when you are looking for something a step above. I would love to go back sometime and try some French food!
