When in Vegas, I recommend this place for brunch. 
Open table, once again is also recommended for making reservations to avoid long waits.

Ask for patio seating, it's well lit and it's nice to people watch whether inside or outside the patio.

Everything is pretty good here. The french toast is sweet on its own and does not require syrup in my opinion. The corn beef hash was really good and paired so well with the runny egg yolk! Love their escargot and mussels, the steak + fries. can't go wrong with and their complimentary bread is addicting. If you like french onion soup, you definitely need to order it here! If you have no other place in mind, this is definitely a safe, go-to spot that will not disappoint! :)
