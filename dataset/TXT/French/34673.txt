HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw I went for dinner. Food is two stars. They are so-so.. Well, its better than Denny's, but you are paying 10 times more here. Everything is greasy in bad way.

Worst part was the service. Our waitress was really rude. She was fu&@ing a bi&@ch. can't believe they hire such an a&@hole. She was blond and cute and blah blah blah,,, but who fu$£ing care. 

Pros:

Great view of the Strip.

Cons:

Greasy.
Bad service.
Overpriced (even though its 'on the Strip' , considering the quality of the food, it is still overpriced.

Never go back. Never recommend to my friends.
