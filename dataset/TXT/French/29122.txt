epvLkQNL6MOvk3s6JlTntA I came here for brunch on a Sunday with my bf, and we had a pretty good meal. I'd been hoping to check this place out for a while, as it's located just three blocks from my apartment and I'd read good things about it. The food is French, mostly crepes, and pretty tasty. 

We started with the pate appetizer, which came with cornichons, sweet onion relish, old-style mustard, and baguette: no complaints, it was very tasty. I then had the special French toast, which came with peaches: for some reason I expect fresh peaches, but they were canned. Still, it was pretty good. My bf got one of their loaded savory crepes, which had cheese, ham and a few other things, and I believe he liked it. We also had two glasses of French hard apple cider: delicious.

So the food was pretty good (but I still want to give it a try for dinner), and the service was also very friendly. Not too much of an ambiance, but it's still a good place to go.
