_IAPvUvtCKzNwBH-w81uEQ We walked in here after not being able to get into the wine bar down the street -- and were very glad we did! It is cozy, welcoming, and the waitress was wonderful. It is a small operation (often the cook came out to hand the food to our waitress!) but we felt very well taken care of. We both ordered off the specials menu -- my mom got the ravioli with truffle butter and sage and I ordered the soup (beef tortellini) and panini special. The pasta was fresh and everything was delicious. Perfect for a cold Edinburgh night!
