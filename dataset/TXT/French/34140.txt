hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA Came here for lunch and the food and service was amazing!  I'm from Hawaii and visit Las Vegas often.  In an attempt to visit non-touristy spots, I came across Baguette Cafe on Yelp.  It's about 20 minutes away from the strip and is located in a business park.  If you're coming here for the first time, it can be a little hard to find, but don't give up because it's worth it!!

The service is excellent where the person who took my order asked me questions about myself and even introduced himself.  He asked me if I've ever been here before too (which is such a difference from the robots who work on the strip restaurants and cafes).  

I ordered their daily special, a Morrocan chicken sandwich.  The chicken was seriously the moistest chicken I've ever had.  I quickly ate my sandwich not only because I was hungry, but this place is a little small, so getting a table might be hard to do when it's busy.  There are tables outside, however, I visited in August and it was 110 degrees outside.
