8ciT6qjI18x9EPtOb-gqYQ To be fair I've only eaten there once - tonight - and all I had was a salad and brought my own wine.  Still, my tab:  $27.   Ouch!  

I can appreciate a corkage fee, but I'm scratching my head in a way... it wasn't a $100 bottle... more like $10.  The staff didn't open it, touch it,  decanter it, chill it, pour it.  They might have not even seen it, but for my asking.

As for the salad, it was good, but nothing one can't make at home for a few dollars.  Greens, apple slices, a few figs and some bits of Rock cheese (or sub any blues).     

Combined with the corkage, I thought it was overpriced and easily replicated for a portion of the cost.

Likewise, my friend had the Brie cheese appetizer, which was pretty much a big chunk of Brie served with bread and fruit.   It looked great, tasted great, but honestly is something one can put together after a shopping trip to TJs.  

It's a charming place, nice staff and I can see how it's popular.  And as mentioned, I've only gone once so maybe the entrees will prove to be outstanding.
