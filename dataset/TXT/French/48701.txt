You'll be greeted by incredibly nice staff as soon as you enter. Service is quick, the food is tasty and the atmosphere is very cozy and romantic with the background music. I'm not the biggest lamb fan in the world, but the lamb shank here was as good as I've ever had. The meat melted right off and was tender and tasty.

One minor criticism was that the parfait dessert I had was quite hard. I'm not sure if it's supposed to be like that, I was expecting something a bit softer. It was difficult to eat with a spoon but it still tasted quite nice.
