She recalled that, years ago when she worked in the neighbourhood, she frequented this place for lunch often. She said she loved the French Onion Soup & the omelets.
So, this past Saturday, she suggested we go & try the place for dinner. We made a reservation for 7PM & were seated right on time as we arrived.
Everything positive you read in previous reviews is correct. Service is extremely good. Food is excellent &, although I was too full to try any dessert, all the deserts I saw being served to other tables looked fantastic. 
I had the filet mignon on the special board with a mushroom soup (daily special) as my appetizer. Every single bite of my meal, filet, potatoes, vegetables & the soup was perfect! My wife had the French Onion soup & the veal medallions. Her veal was served in the same, excellent demi glace my filet was. I tied my wife's soup & her veal- both beyond reproach.
Small, cozy room. Simple, well-executed menu. Service above normal- suitable for a high-end restaurant. This place is GREAT & I will be going here often, for sure.
