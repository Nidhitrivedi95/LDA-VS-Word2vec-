Ncvd4l3zo72FUK5kovQhYQ Have been to cafe des Amis many times. Thought it was time to provide a review. 

This is a great little place to stop by for breakfast or lunch. I am very fond of their assorted quiches and soups while my daughters love their crepes especially the nutella one. I have even stopped by to pick up dessert to bring home. The chocolate tart was delicious. 

You walk in and order from the menu, when the food is ready they bring it to your table. The wait is not long. They keep the tables very clean, very efficient.

The only drawback is the atmosphere is a bit dull. Plastic tablecloths.  Needs a little warming up in the decor. Maybe some upbeat french jazz background music. 

This is one of our favorite places in sewickley to go for brunch on the weekend. Family friendly and you don't feel rushed. Grab a paper and relax. Have something good to eat and then go on and order dessert. It will be delicious.
