lNB-yJoVi-sk6X0uoWOh-g The restaurant itself is very pretty. The organic wine we had was great. The appetizer - I had the salmon gravlax... was very tasty - although tough to cut through? Service was not great - asked for bread and never got it; young lady taking our wine order definitely was either in a very bad mood, or had a major attitude problem. 

Mains were not great. The Bison and Black Cod both disappointed. Won't be going back.
