mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q Where do you go after winning money at the tables in Vegas? Duh... to L'Atelier! 

We were there with a group of 8 so we got to try many different offerings.

To start the baguettes were to die for!  They make it fresh in house. 

From the small tasting menu we ordered: 
Scallop carpaccio with sea urchin
Fresh marinated anchovies with sliced eggplant confit
Traditionally poached chilled duck foie gras
Tuna belly confit on a young vegetable gelée
Foie gras ravioli in a warm chicken broth with herbs
Macaroni in a Comté gratin, green asparagus and smoked veal bacon
Maine lobster fricassée with mushrooms and creamy aromatic sauce
Caramelized kampa chi with soy and endive salad
Calf sweetbread with fresh laurel and stuffed romaine lettuce

From the regular menu:
Steak tartar with old-fashioned French fries
Wagyu beef rib eye
Sea bass roasted on the skin, green curry and warm leeks salad

Dessert:
Green chartreuse soufflé, pistachio ice cream
Fresh raspberry surprise inside white chocolate sphere, yuzu ice cream
Panna cotta topped with corn ice cream, fresh citrus salad

All I can say is that each dish that came out was better than the one before.  Joel Robuchon is a genius.  

If you happen to come across some money and are not sure what you would like to do with it, do yourself a favor and make reservations at L'Atelier! You will not regret it!
