YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g Used to come here for the carambar ice-cream. Ordered it again to discover no trace of the carambar taste at all in it. I don't know what they are using now, but it's definitely not carambar. I have given them one star due to the dishonest menu description. They didn't seem particularly phased when we pointed out this problem either.
