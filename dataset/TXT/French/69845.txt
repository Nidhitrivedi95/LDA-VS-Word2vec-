WOj8nPos3R9IIf0Pyttd8g I ate dinner there last night and had a lovely evening. Bottles of wine under $32 are half price on Tuesdays (although they didn't have as wide of a French selection as I had hoped -- and the only Pinot Noir on their menu was Chilean, odd for a French restaurant!)

They were out of the brie-stuffed chicken which I was bummed about as I was hoping to try that! But we went with escargot to start (classic, drenched in oil and garlic-y goodness) and got a bottle of the Côtes du Rhône to split.

The service was wonderful, but that might have to do with the fact that we were one of just a few tables there that evening.

I got the mussels (normandes style - with cream, bacon, mushrooms and parsley) and my date got the poulet w/ frites. The mussels were yummy and there were too many to finish. Their house cut fries are to die for -- the chicken was delicious as well but a small portion (better to get the Ashley Farms 1/2 chicken when they have it!)

We ended the night with creme brulee --- pretty classic nothing super special about it, but we did scrape the bowl if that tells you anything! All in all really great evening. Would definitely recommend.
