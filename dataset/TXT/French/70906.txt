xBxDMEkFK5GBhiy-8gGE9w This was an amazing meal all around.  It also brought us to one of our firsts in dining experiences.  This was the first time we had to bring home an appetizer!  We ordered the charcuterie platter for the 2 of us.  That platter is really meant for at least 4!  It was fantastic, however next time we would stick to the duck rillettes, duck terrine and fois gras terrine as they were our favorites.  Thats not to say that the others werent great as well including the pork cretons.  They also brought housemade pickled pickles, yummy.  We also had the cold tomato soup which was so simple yet really well executed with delicious tomatoes.  The french baguette was also great, crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.  For dinner we had the steak frites and tuna tartare (special).  Both were delicious, we could not get enough of the tartare!  We were beyond stuffed at the end of this meal and had some charcuterie for the next day!
