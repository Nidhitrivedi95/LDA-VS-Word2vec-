rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A One of my favorite things about Vegas is the food. When I come to this city, I want to eat and be deliciously impressed. This place did not disappoint...I had the seared scallops with a side if some sort of squash creation, and it was PHENOM. Several of my friends had the vegetarian option of gnocchi with asparagus, and I have no idea what the chef did to this dish. The gnocchi had amazing pillowy texture yet was somehow sort of toasty tasting (brown butter sauce, maybe?) and it was literally the best I have ever had. 

The only downside was that we were at a table of 10 girls and they could not split the check by seat. Not sure I really understand that...just be advised and bring cash if you're in a big group and you're not expecting one person to grab the bill.
