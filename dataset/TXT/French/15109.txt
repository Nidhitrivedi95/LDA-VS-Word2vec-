63in7ND_-TPVVI_J12JLRA Great food, reasonably priced, and a wonderful cause. The staff of volunteers is enthusiastic about what they're doing, which is wonderful to see. I had the burger, which I highly recommend, with their arugula salad as an entree which was plenty filling but I still found space for one of their delicious desserts. Even better, after that I went to their "salle de défoulement", where for 2$, you can write something on a plate and throw it against a wall. The proceeds go to charity and it's lots of fun. Overall, a great place that I highly recommend.
