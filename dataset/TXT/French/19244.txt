aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw I've been to Bouchon bakery in Yountville and the one at the Venetian casino pales in comparison.  We ordered an epi bead which was stale, we ordered the chocolate bouchons which were dry and 2 cinnamon rolls which were also very dry.  I don't know if these pastries were old but it is not even close to the scale of deliciousness of the food you get from Yountville.  I hope they do something to fix this becasue it would be ashame to have such a fantastic bakery become mediocre.
