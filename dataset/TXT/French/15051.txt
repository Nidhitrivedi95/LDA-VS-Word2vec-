63hkYvXXcZsHeCeZBQbfew Really delicious fast-food Lebanese food that has way more flavour than the likes of Amir and Basha. On Peel, joint with a Subway restaurant -- how anyone can walk in smelling the deliciousness that is Shawarmaz and pick Subway is beyond me!! It wasn't our first time at this resto so we opted to try something new. Their magic poutine is to die for, having won poutine week a couple of years back. The special shawarmaz wrap was very tasty, with a very thin bread used instead of the usual pita, served grilled with garlic potatoes and a drink for $11.50. A must try in the area!
