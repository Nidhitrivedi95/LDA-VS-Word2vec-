cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg We were told by a few folks from the area to make a reservation here weeks in advance, and glad we did so. The food was quite good and it was very busy. Service was a bit slow, and the place is expensive but you should come here and check it out.

We got a charcuterie platter, the tuna tartar special, and duck in a can. The tuna was awesome, charcuterie was great, and the duck was amazing. We didn't love the pig brain but everything else on the platter was delicious. The duck was great, that is a must if you come here. And they serve hot bread which is quite tasty.

Worth making a reservation well in advance.
