rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I eat a lot.  Every so often I get to have a meal that takes it to the next level.  Bouchon was definitely that meal.

In the tacky wonderland that is Vegas, it is so tucked away that if you subscribe to Retards Monthy (as I do), you won't even be able to find it.  It's all hard wood, high ceilings and soft lighting, opening out onto a veranda.  

I don't remember as much about the food as I should, but I remember tasting the Keller influence.  God, I love that man.  He makes food so evocative.  Like, it will remind you of the best thing your mom ever cooked, without actually tasting like it.  Please don't mock.  I mean it.  Anyway, I do remember the texture of the pork belly.  All crispy crackly on top, giving way to tender fatty goodness below.  (Homer Simpson noise here.)

Also awesome was pointing out to my friend that there were some whores a few tables down from us.  I thought them waaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyy too good looking to be with the douchebags they were supping with.  Then my former best friend noted that one of the douchebags they were with owned the Kings and the Palms.  Mr. Maloof's identity was confirmed by our waiter.  Shcore.  Pseudo celebrity siting.  

Anyway.  Go here.  It's a welcome respite from the tacky hustle and bustle of most of the Vegas strip.  You'll feel all civilized and shit.  Also, if you go, I will be your whore for the evening.  Provided you pay for dinner, of course.
