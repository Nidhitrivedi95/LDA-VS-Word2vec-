This place is garbage. Their cooking is so bad Somalia would send it back. The waitress, Adriana, is a stupid rude bitch. She never refilled my water, took forever to serve us (30 minutes, not a busy time or day). She barely acknowledged us.

She gave me attitude about asking for butter with my English muffin. She threw the food at us. I didn't care for her snippy attitude or for the poor quality food. 


I worked in food service for years. I never have attitude or first did any harm to customers, so I know how "hard" her job is. I'm so sick of people rushing to the defense of bad servers. Yes, some customers are trouble, but not always. Sometimes it's the server who is the problem, especially if it's someone like Adrianna. No excuse for this behavior.


The manager didn't care at all. I hope this place goes under.
