4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw The restaurant was fairly empty for a Tuesday night, which surprised me because I heard reservations were pretty much mandatory. I was planning on coming for breakfast but I couldn't squeeze it into my schedule, nor do I wake up that early after a hangover. I was actually scared there was going to be a crowd as we planned on watching a Cirque du Soleil show so I made reservations at 5, a little bit before dinner time. Nevertheless, I still suggest you make reservations because although this restaurant is very big, I can see why this is one of the more popular restaurants in Vegas. They have a bar too so you feel free to order a drink while you wait for your table. And at the front desk, make sure to ask to sit outside for fresh air and a good view of the fountains!

They gave us a complementary baguette in a bag to start and our appetizer came pretty quickly but entrees took around half an hour to come out. I was unsure if everyone if my party ate Escargot so I went with the safer choice, Housemade Country Pate, which was rich and flavorful. For my entrée I got their, Steak Frites Bordelaise, or caramelized onion with red wine sauce. The sauce was a little overpowering but the steak was extremely tender. Overall, their price wasn't that bad especially since they're on the strip and I was surprised they weren't charging more for their food, especially for the prime location. Service was on the slow side but our waiter was very nice and checked up on us multiple times over dinner. When we were done, people started to trickle in and it started to get a lot busier. I definitely can't wait to come back, especially for their breakfast menu!
