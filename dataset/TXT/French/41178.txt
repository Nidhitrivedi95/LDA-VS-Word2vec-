kGOr_D-LNpgZ2M9N8TT4QQ I was here for summerlicious recently. The mani course was phenomenal (steak frites). The steak was cooked perfectly, medium rare as I requested and exquisitely tender. The fries, cooked in duck fat was indulgent and crispy. I enjoyed that the steak and fries were served separately, avoiding soggy fries. In terms of ambience, I thought it closely resembled cafe boulud, also in yorkville located in the four seasons hotel; the quintessential upscale Parisian bistro.
