We had a dozen oysters (2 different kinds, both delicious and perfectly shucked) which came with a nice cocktail sauce, red-wine vinegar shallot ordeal and horseradish. We also had the garden salad which was large and refreshing but slightly overly apple cider vinegary. We then went all out with the lobster spaghetti which was what you would expect: a whole lobster (in the shell as opposed to the same dish at partnering Joe Beef next door), spaghetti and about a pound of butter. It was good. Maybe not 55$ good. 

Service was ok, but it was late night and I felt the server was ready to go home.

The music was great and the vibe was comfortable, we had a fun time.
