I2LcbNXGsMb6zxh4-gmVHw I was in town for a conference and ended up sick (boo!) so I needed to find a good place that was close to the hotel. I loved Bonjour! The staff was delightful, the ambiance comfortable, and the food (I had ginger tea, beef pho, vegetarian spring rolls) was wonderful. After visiting Vietnam just last year, I have been obsessed with home made pho, and this place definitely hit the spot. If I ever visit Phoenix again, I would absolutely return.
