QeFsIMcIFIJcOrpthYL8jg We just returned from our meal at Modavie and WOW... We were underwhelmed.

After being positively wowed at our previous Montreal spots, our four person team was expecting another great meal. We had made reservations for the jazz area and were greeted by nice soft jazz. The man, who seemed to be the owner, joked that I had written on my reservation that if I didn't enjoy the food, I wouldn't pay. If only.

We sat down, ordered drinks and apps: a cheese board, calamari, a soup and salad. Came out just fine, calamari was crispy, cheese plate was good, big strips of bacon on the salad. We also put our  entrees in before the apps arrived.

And then we waited. Watched the tables that were sat after us get their food. Watched them finish their food. Watched their waters get refilled while ours sat empty. Watched our drinks whittle away to nothing... And then watched as waiters rushed by without a word to us.

Finally our food came. One pasta dish was incorrect and had to be sent back. The mussels were lukewarm and the fries cold. The confit duck was hot, but the skin was flabby like over cooked pasta and the roasted carrots were well under. It was not impressive. The correct pasta came later, and was relatively flavors AND we had to ask to get drinks refilled.

We picked at our food a bit, politely declined dessert and any takeout boxes. We received the check and were dismayed to find none of our concerns were acknowledged on the bill.

I wouldn't recommend wasting your money or time here. Go elsewhere.
