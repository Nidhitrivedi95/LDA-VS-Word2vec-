SpkwuDQChxHlNwfnx7OWUA 1st time experience at poutine dare to be fresh. By far the best poutine i've ever had with generous portions. I've ordered bbq pork bursting with flavour. Layered fries, cheese curds with tons of gravy hits the spot. Reasonably priced, wish management would address the pricing more clearly. Sm: $7.99, reg: $9.99 
xl: 12.99. Crazy busy joint in small welcoming atmosphere. Def place worth checking out, highly recommend! Can't wait to dive in again.
