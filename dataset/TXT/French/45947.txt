mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q Are you kidding me... $167 for two teensy plates of food and half a bottle of wine? I'm carb-free but I ate ALL the bread, just hoping to eek out my money's worth... Nope, still ended up getting a burger at Wolfgang Puck later. What a waste!
The service was fine, but I had made a reservation and was given a 5:45pm. No problem, I figured, if that's all they have because they're going to be jam-packed all evening. Except when we arrived, the place was completely empty! Then instead of a table, they offered us seats at the BAR. What the hell did I make a reservation two days in advance and get dressed up to the nines for?
I felt terrible because my fiance specifically said he wanted to get a "nice Vegas dinner," and I took him here based on all the hype. Luckily he enjoyed his hangar steak and didn't complain about the prices, but that doesn't stop me from feeling like he got ripped off.
I got the quail... my two bites of fancy bird meat were difficult to get off the bone and tasted undercooked. Screw JR.
