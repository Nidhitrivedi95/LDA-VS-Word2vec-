The food was absolutely wonderful, every bite was a treat. The prices are a little steep but way worth it in my mind. I loved that the tomatoes that were served with my meal were local and absolutely delicious. My bf wolfed them down and he normally hates veggies. 

It's one of the many old houses turned restaurants near downtown and was very charming and the atmosphere was so comfortable. The ladies working there were delightful and helpful.

I'd definitely recommend it to anyone in the area or any visitors to the area.
