Perfectly chewy and sweet and large enough to fulfill your sweet tooth.  Although pricey, the macarons here are well worth it.  I come here to bring home a box every time I visit Vegas, and will continue to do so.  I love the coffee macaron, and the pistachio is a close second.  All other flavors are delicious as well.

The almond croissant is also yummy if you're feeling a little indulgent.
