fFInb4Dl2Ix4iE-VOltbkQ I went here with my partner on a Sunday night. We arrived around 8:45 and was greeted by a super friendly hostess. She had us wait at the bar for a few minutes while our table was being cleaned. This restaurant is in a boutique hotel and has a wonderful ambiance. Their staff are very well trained as all of them were extremely helpful and nice. Once we were seated, we were served an amuse-Bouche, which was small but good and a basket of bread. The bread wasn't the freshest but it was fine. For our meals, we ordered from the bar menu for appetizers. We got the spicy chips and the salad. We found the chips to be really bland so we told the waiter who quickly took them away and told us there would be no charge. The salad, however, was one of the best I've ever tasted. For our mains, we shared the filet mignon and the basil pasta dish. The pasta was good but the steak was absolutely delicious. The potatoes and vegetables that were served with it were so good, my partner did not want to share with me.
For dessert, we ordered the "summer memories" which was a banana milkshake, a homemade ice cream sandwich and a smore. It was a really sophisticated and pretty desert but wasn't amazing. If I were you, I would just order more food and skip dessert there.

The service was incredible from our waiter Maxime. He was so professional and kind. For example, when I accidentally spilled the milkshake, he got me a replacement so quickly I barely had time to blink. He was really a pleasure.

Overall, I would love to come here for a fancy (and slightly overpriced) meal.
