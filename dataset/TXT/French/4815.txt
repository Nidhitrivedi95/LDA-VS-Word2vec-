33Tr0eRki1Yamzleu4GMdw I went to Rosallie for lunch today with a coworker. I am currently trying to eat a low-carb diet, and even though this is a French bakery, they were able to make me a fantastic salad with ham and cheese and a house made vinaigrette. Technically, the salad was also supposed to have egg, but it's not a big deal that they left it off. Their iced tea made with Earl Grey tea leaves was fantastic. I had a small bite of my friends croissant and it was probably the best croissant I've ever had. My total check for an iced tea and a salad was $10 and change. Considering the quality and the freshness, I thought this was a great deal. The service was also very good, and if this matters to you like it matters to me, their bathroom was clean and well lit.
