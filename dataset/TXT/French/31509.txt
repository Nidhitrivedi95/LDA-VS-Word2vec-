gjCmXkMNVE0JSk8puUwv6g The food was AMAZING and very, very tasty. We ordered the leak and another soup which was Thai-like: coconut and citrusy. Both were extremely delicious. Then we all ordered the octopus, which came from Spain - very tender. It was the best octopus I had in several years; done properly with a mixture of vegetables that accompanied it exquisitely. Then of course, coffee and dessert. We ordered the chocolate cake and chestnut creme puff. It was heaven without it being overwhelmingly sweet. We were so happy with the food that we ordered sandwiches to go: the cured ham panini, a vegetable one and a tuna sandwich. The panini had a pesto sauce and mozzarella. Delicious! And the prices were very affordable for the quality of food. The chef even came out to check-in with everyone to see if the food was to their liking. Very professional, including the staff. The interior of the place is clean and modern. So don't let the unassuming exterior fool you - this place is a GEM in Las Vegas. Enjoy!
