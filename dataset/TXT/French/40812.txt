kcF-en40P3J9L8nLy5lKqQ Very good addition to the neighborhood.

The decor is great. The bar is comfortable and open, perfect setting to wait or just to hang out.

I had the watermelon feta salad which was unexpectedly great. The pickled onions were tasteful and the presentation is wonderful. Once in a while the mint flavor kicked in to boost the taste of the salad. If you order it, I would recommend to order it easy on the onions, unless you want to be single for the rest of your life (just saying).

The mushroom pasta was also pretty good.

No complaints at all about the service and the price was pretty fair. 

The wine by the glass from Oregon (pinot noir) was pretty good.

We were celebrating a birthday and the party was pretty big, so we ended up sitting in 3 different tables. I don't know if they have a private dinning room but if you have a big party and want to be all together, this might not be the right place. In our case, we had a wonderful time and the 3 table deal worked just fine.

Highly recommended.

Cheers
