rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A We had brunch here and the food was... okay.  I did read the reviews prior to coming here so I had somewhat high expectations.

I had the Sourdough Waffles.  I don't really understand what all the excitement is regarding the vanilla bean butter.  It didn't taste like anything.  Honestly I wasn't blown away by the waffles either.  They weren't bad but I have had comparable ones at local diners.  

The bf had one of the specials.  I don't remember what it was but he said it wasn't too great and he was still hungry after our meal.

We also ordered the fries to split.  I really only ordered these because so many people raved about it.  Now I'm beginning to think that people were just being sarcastic.  They are just regular fries.  Mickey D's makes them better.  The frozen ones you buy at the store to fry up at home taste better.  We didn't finish them and one of the busboys said, "No one ever finishes the fries."

What I did like about Bouchon was the atmosphere.  It was so nice to have brunch in such a beautiful setting.  We sat indoors because it was a little windy that day but I would definitely opt to sit outside if the weather is right.  It looked really pretty out there.

Overall, I thought the location and service were top-notch but the food just not worth the price.  I am willing to come here again and order something different.
