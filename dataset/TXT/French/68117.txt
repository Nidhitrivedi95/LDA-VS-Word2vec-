vg55SAkrEmuHpWfIMtJjBQ It is a nice spot in Oakland. It's been a while since I visited, so I don't really remember what we ordered except for the beef tartar as an appetizer. It doesn't matter tho b/c they do change the menu constantly. Both the food and the service were good. 
Only reason I'm giving this place 4 stars instead of 5 is that I felt the food, while solid, did not  stand out.
