BSmqxPbQglQwP2R56OqOag I am giving a 4 star to the food. If it was based on service, it would be anything from a 1 star to a 3 star depending on which time I went.

I am obsessed with their chicken club sandwich, it is so good! I only wish it was on their dinner menu so I could get it more often. I have been here quite a few times for lunch and only once for dinner. Good selection on both. I want to go back to try some more of their pasta options for dinner, there were so many that sounded good I wanted to get a whole buffet!

They have brunch on the weekend, I am not crazy about their breakfast foods - they sound great, but I haven't been overly impressed. But it is a brunch menu so you can get some of their lunch items as well. Plus they have bottomless mimosas which are always a bonus!

It's a pretty cool atmosphere, all the walls are lined with their wine selection and chalk boards featuring specials.
