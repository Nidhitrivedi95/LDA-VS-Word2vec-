vg55SAkrEmuHpWfIMtJjBQ Disclaimer:  Legume is another "I wish I could use half stars" kind of place.  On almost every front (ambiance, service, food, etc.) it delivers, but for some reason, it's just missing the "magic".  I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt because I've had not one, but two great meals here within two months time (and consistency in this business is hard to come by!).

The combination between Legume and its accompanying bar, Butterjoint, is one to be reckoned with.  While I'm typically a beer guy, the cocktails I sampled on both occasions (plus one visiting Butterjoint itself) were solid.

Relative to appetizers, I highly recommend any of the pates or tartars the make the menu for that night (they feature a seasonal menu that changes daily).  In addition, one of the cheapest options on the menu, the goat cheese and pepper crostini ($5), is one of the best!

Both of my entrees were great.  The duck confit course on my first visit nailed that delicate balance between tender, perfectly cooked meat and that addictive crunchy skin that offsets its texture and the pork/poultry combo for my second was delicately prepared and well balanced.

On both occasions, the Shaker Corn side was the star of the show.  Dried corn that's re-hydrated and cooked in mini cast iron skillets with a creamy sauce.  Best of all, my desserts in both cases were great, my favorite being the knock-out banana and chocolate chunk cake with pecans, banana anglais and salted caramel ice cream (the fat kid in me was in heaven).

I will definitely be back in the future.
