AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw Had a ton of vouchers from a timeshare that we used here for breakfast and brunch. Quiet, peaceful, continental and fresh. Try their breakfast "buffet" of sorts. So yummy and classy buffet isn't a befitting word. Beautiful flaky crispy and sweet light pastries, and crisp lean but richly warm coffee. Have the croque Madame or croque mr. To start your day off right.
