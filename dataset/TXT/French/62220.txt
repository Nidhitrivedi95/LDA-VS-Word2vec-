SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ First of all.. this is a beautiful little cottage with an outstanding patio that is just beautiful. Love the little tea lights,,white table clothes. Plants and trees. Very romantic with perfect ambience. Our server was great, very pleasant , and knowledgeable about the wines. I had an exceptional Chardonnay. Ok now for the downfall, it was my sisters birthday and she ordered the Cornish game hen. Very salty and skin was burnt. Our server did offer another dish but my sister declined. The cheese platter which we ordered as an appetizer was very uneventful and sparse! Only offered 4 to 5 cheeses some nuts and 5 grapes! No other fruit that they show in pictures that other patrons have taken. All of our main entrees for the price, which is extremely expensive, just didn't make the grade, with the exception of the beef tenderloin, which my daughter ordered. She enjoyed that very much. All in all this was very disappointing. I was looking forward to coming to this quaint little gem in Tempe, but I'm not sure that I'll be back.
