27vF5LESbv4kFQfHZUDCnw Hubby and I were in the area and in the mood for a coffee / dessert. Found this place on yelp and decided to give it a try. We got the almond croissant and the bread pudding + a mocha. The pastries were amazing (best almond croissant ever!!), but the coffee was lukewarm. We noticed how the barista barely heated the milk for other coffees she prepared while we were there. Fortunately, nothing could spoil my enchantment with that croissant, but I may get a regular coffee or take the pastries to go in the future.
