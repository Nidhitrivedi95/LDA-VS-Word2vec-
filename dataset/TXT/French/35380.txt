htQgj-ANQpZGpIpkkrEmyQ We had made a reservation almost a week ago for Saturday night. We drove all the way from downtown to Markham to find out that they do not have our reservation in the book. We even showed the phone log to show we called on Tuesday to make the reservation. They refused to accommodate and denied us. This is absolutely UNACCEPTABLE. I refuse to recommend this restaurant to anyone due to this kind of service.
