K2C8dSx9215LLcIzHL959Q We went last night. There were 4 of us. Three of us had the wine pairing. The food was very good. The foie gras was the hit of the night. The amounts were so tiny. The 4 of us also had dessert. Our bill was $500 including the tip and all of us left hungry. That's insane. We have eaten in the best restaurants all around the world and never spent $500 and left hungry. In fact, on the way home, we stopped and ate sushi at the best sushi place in Pittsburgh, Little Tokyo. I love to go out to eat to fine restaurants, as a matter of fact, we do it every weekend. But I feel his old place around the corner was better because you could pick what you wanted off of the menu. Now this place has 3 or 8 course menus. The 8 course is a surprise so you don't know what you are getting and with the 3 course you get to pick each course by getting a choice of 3 things for each course. I won't be going back.
