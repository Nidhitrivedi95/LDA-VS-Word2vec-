O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q This place was surprisingly great -- given that it's on the Strip.   IME the vast majority of the Strip restaurants tend to be soulless and robotic -- they're like machines where a big-name chef put his name over the door then left the local staff to dutifully crank out a set menu for mobs of tourists.  I'm used to having mediocre-to-meh-competent overpriced meals on the Strip.  

At Morels, I was there mid-afternoon (in between shifts -- usually not a great time to get good food) -- yet the food was delicious and tasted like somebody had really been paying attention when they made it, not just doing it by rote.  Steak was high quality and correctly prepared.  Fries were delicious and hot fresh.  Side dish, salad, dessert, all good.  Good selection of wines by the glass.  Service was attentive.  

I suspect the experience may vary depending on how busy they are.  I was there with only a handful of other guests....I tried to go back one evening and it was mobbed, mobbed, mobbed -- it's in the lobby of the Palazzo so an easy meeting place, esp when there's a conference with thousands of people at the Palazzo conference center.   

That said, I'd go back in a hot second.
