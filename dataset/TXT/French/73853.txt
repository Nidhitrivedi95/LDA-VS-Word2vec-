xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g This restaurant is fantastic!  Wonderful view, great service, and delicious food.  I picked this place to celebrate our anniversary and was glad I did. We both had the tasting menu - which was superb. My favorite was the warm lobster salad which was delicious.  The only disappointment was I got too full - so come hungry if you order the tasting menu.  This place is pricey but worth it.
