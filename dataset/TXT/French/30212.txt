FRuuIDOd21pTJHvEGIt1Gg Five stars all around!

Food: the beef cheeks were so tender! Highly recommended! The tilapia was extremely well seasoned with amazing flavor. The French Onion Soup was lighter than most, which was great for me; most French Onion Soups in this town are way too salty. The dessert that required a fifteen minute wait was decadent! The ice cream under the cookie was so unique in flavor that I wish I could bring a tub of it back home! The one Rose that they had tasted great, too, but might not have been worth that amount of money; wish the wine glasses were larger!

Service: this place might have the most efficient wait staff in all my adventures in Montreal. My water glass was was always full, there was plenty of bread, and food was ready in more than reasonable time.

Decor: the bar is stocked from ground to ceiling with wine bottles and other alcohol. Everything is placed so high up that the bartender needed a ladder. 

Awesome experience! I hope to return!
