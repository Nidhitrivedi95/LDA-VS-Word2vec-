UxWH8zRYIBgs6Q2oykvRdw Take some space in the Distillery and throw some euros at it and bingo you have a wonderful french bistro

Its a wonderful spot to go to for drinks and eats even if you are not planning to spend some time knocking around the distillery.

This place is really about the ambiance and decor and if you close your eyes you will feel that you are in paris until the server speaks to you in english. Service is very good with no complaints even when attending with 8 guests.

Food is good and probably the emphasis is usually on the pastries anyways ( i dont recall rabbit on the menu) so they go extra mile on presentation.

Nice thing is that if you go as a group the menu will appeal to all and even the die hards will enjoy the french onion soup starter (it really is that good), mains and then melt with joy over the various baked items.

after a few visits I finally caught on they have a take out bakery (left side of entrance) and gelato......hmmmmm you could almost park without paying, run in, grab stuff and be on your way before the parking patrol slaps ya a ticket. The $4/hr fee will pay for some croissants.....
