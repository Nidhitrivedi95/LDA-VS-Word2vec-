mRrgBIT8vsYdI3YSfzCQhg I dropped by based on the reviews here. 
Was looking for good food and a glass of wine. Veal was cooked perfectly  .
Great service.  Awesome food. Nice California wine. Resisted dessert this time likely won't next time. 
Will be back. Owner Mellissa and chef husband run a nice operation here.
