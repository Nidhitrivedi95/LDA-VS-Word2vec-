XZ7eQLjyGXf6y69UT4SGhg Stopped for a late morning coffee and there were plenty of freshly baked goods. We travel frequently and search out good bakeries wherever we go. This one ranks among the best French style bakeries. The warmed almond croissant and cinnamon roll were excellent, crispy, buttery and not too sweet. Our stop here was well worth it!
