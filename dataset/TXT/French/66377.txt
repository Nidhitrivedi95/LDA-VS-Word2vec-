uP3H5bcsiTXM0k0xQhRndg Got the Mac and cheese (~25$) and the pork belly (~35$ -- definitely on the pricey side), to split between two people. Both were very tasty, but are also both very rich dishes. At some point while eating, they became a bit much to stomach. I'd recommend pairing a lighter dish with either of these (a salad or the soup) to offset the heaviness. Very good food, though!
