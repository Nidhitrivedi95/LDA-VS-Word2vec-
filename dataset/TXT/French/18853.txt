I did try 3 of the macrons a Basil White Chocolate, Black Currant and a Paradise Fruit with Dark chocolate and they were absolutely delectable.  They also have espresso and other coffee drinks, I was too busy looking at all the pretty things to notice much else but it's a beautiful store, definitely a great first date or a place for dessert after!  Totally can't wait to buy some for future parties!
