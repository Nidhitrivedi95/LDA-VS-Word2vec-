Ht-_i0UAq7YDBaqJwcQMdQ I went to Le Club Chasse et Peche (which translates to the Surf and Turf Club) with 7 guys during my bachelor party weekend. This is not a typcial restaurant for such an occasion, however, being a lover of food I wanted to experience one of Montreal's better restaurants.

The place did not dissapoint. The actual space was awesome, located in a stone building in the Old Montreal section of the city, it had a little bit of dungeon feel to it. Our server was great. Not only was she patient with us (which took a lot as most of the people at the table had been drinking for a little while prior to showing up for dinner), but she took the time to explain each dish on the menu. I started with the veal sweetbread, which was perfectly fried and came paired with a cold shrimp dish. For a main course, I had braised boar belly. It came in the braising liquid with apples and was excellent, it wasn't as fatty as I anticipated it to be (thinking along the lines of pork belly), and had a slightly gamey taste to it which I like. 

There was no dessert ordered after the meal, people instead chose to continue drinking their martinis and wine, etc. Other items ordered off the menu were oysters, risotto with roast suckling pig and foie gras shavings, and kobe beef wrapped in bacon paired with lobster. According to everyone at the table, all were excellent. And every other dish I sampled at the table was cooked perfectly.

With tax and tip, and everyone chipping in to pay for the bachelor, dinner came to around $150 a person. That included martinis, beers, and several pricey bottles of wine. If you are ever in Montreal, I suggest you make a reservation for dinner at Le Club Chasse et Peche, it's worth the money.
