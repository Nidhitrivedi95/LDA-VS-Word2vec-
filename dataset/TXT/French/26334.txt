D7CnTsm8SCmbQghz1ioPdw Was here for dinner. As soon as you walk in you feel like you are in a cabin up north. Very nice and cozy. We started with a mix of oysters which were very tasty and the smoked duck which was much better than i had imagined. I ordered the lamb shoulder and as my main and it was extremely succulent and cooked to perfection. The menu is nit very big but i could have easily ordered any of the dishes as they all sounded good. For dessert we had an apple crumble which was nice and warm with a scoop of whisky ice cream on top. The whole bill came to $166 plus tax and tip. We each ordered 2 drinks each, so for all that the price is very reasonable for the area. Our waiter was extremely friendly and took his time explainable all the specials and was always there right when we needed anything. There are parking lots and spaces right outside and it is located right in old Montreal which is a huge plus.
