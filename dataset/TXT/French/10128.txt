4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I think I made the mistake of not ordering a steak. I went to the buffet earlier and thought I'd do myself a service of a lighter fare, but all the non-heavy entrees aren't particularly special. I don't think anyone in my party liked what they got, so a steak next time for sure. 

All in all, the dining experience is pretty good, with the Paris theme and the outdoor seating fitting.
