or4UVDjXEEjze3wNPjoAZA I adore the French culture and food, so therefore I like it already. Hehehe! =)

The first time I came here, I had ordered this seafood tartare.  One had foie gras, which is fatty Goose Liver! Sooo good, but can only have a bite size.  Came with a side of duck frites, just fancier fries, but not sure if they drizzle like duck grease or something.

Second time I had ordered a filet mignon with foie gras, was prepared well.  I also tried this crepe appetizer with lobster sauce! yum!

Very very nice French decor! They got a nice, cute little garden area deep inside the restaurant for outside seating to remind you of Paris.  Oh, they have a small scale Eiffel Tower to light up the interior space of the restaurant to add a nice touch! =)
