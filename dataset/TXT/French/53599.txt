qmh6zxtJ8C8-YiUPv7ySlw I really dug the food here.  We were lucky enough to score a 10 person table last minute facing the acid-trippy waterfall.

Charcuterie board was excellent and I would not share the foie gras, using a dull knife in sweeping motions to fend people off.

I was told to have the burger and I was not disappointed. Cooked to my liking, it was a lot more flavourful than I was expecting.  Our Ryan Gosling-lookalike waiter was efficient and quick witted.
