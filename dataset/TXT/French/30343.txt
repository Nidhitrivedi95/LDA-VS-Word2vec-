FRuuIDOd21pTJHvEGIt1Gg So nice. 

5 stars for service....we walked in on the busiest of nights and the host found us a table without a reservation.

5 stars for wait staff......could not have been nicer.

5 stars for wine list.......very good selection of wines by the glass and an excellent martini.

5 stars for food.....bistro fare as good as it gets.  Better confit de canard than France! and the endive salade w/ blue cheese and raisins was amazing.

All in all, a great neighborhood packed happy spot to get a delicious casual, authentic French meal with the kindest service.
