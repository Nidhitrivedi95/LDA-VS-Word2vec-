O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q My wife and I have been regular customers over several years with the last visit being about 2 years ago. This last visit was on Christmas Day. 

In the past we had always had excellent service and even better food. Our experience this time was extremely disappointing. The service was very poor. It took about 15 minutes after being seated to place a drink order and an additional 30 minutes to finally get the drinks. During that time I asked for the cheese appetizer menu which I never received. I also had to asked 2 times for the wine menu which I finally got after 15 minutes or so however no one ever came to ask for the wine order. 

In the past Morels has provided some of the best steaks I've ever had. This time they were average at best and on top of that they were undercooked. We ordered medium and they came just barely rare. Will not be returning to Morels because there are too many other good choices in Vegas.
