W6D2egUbZzkMtVfR_wf3QQ I found the place while wandering Westmount for the first time on a Friday afternoon. We were staying at a hotel closer to downtown and had been to the usual places around Sherbrooke/Centre-Ville. We went the next day for a Saturday brunch and had an excellent meal of eggs Benedict, waffles and crepes. All were done very well in an environment much more elegant and better service than the trendy places downtown without the annoying wait and the noise. If you want excellent food, very good service in a quiet place to enjoy brunch at a very reasonable price, this is the place.
