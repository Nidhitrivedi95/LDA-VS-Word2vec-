Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA Had dinner there last night with a group, opened the menu and was shocked by the prices. $23 for an appetizer salad?!?!?  Fine, if the food is pricy, it better be amazing... well, it was good, but not truly amazing.

For appetizer, I ordered the foie gras with cranberry (~$28) and it was pretty damn good.  Small portions, but that's to be expected at a french restaurant.  Melted in my mouth, and the cranberry sauce was perfection.
For main course, ordered the pork loin with chorizo bits and grits ($38) and it was less than amazing. the pork was very tough, ended up eating mostly the grits. the best pork i've ever had was at mesa grill in ceaser's palace.
For dessert, got the chocolate volcano with mango sorbet ($12), which was chocolate covered chocolate mousse and very good.

The service was great, we got complimentary little cups of soup as appetizer and madelines for dinner. Not to mention the view... but if you want the view just get a drink at the bar next door to the restaurant or at one of the many, many rooftop bars in vegas.
