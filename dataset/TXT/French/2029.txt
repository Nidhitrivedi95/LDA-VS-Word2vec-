0nddnkjG1RV8hdFdy_wCMA Some of the best baked goods ANYWHERE. I am here almost every weekend. The quiche is excellent. The croissants...I want to be buried in one of them when I go. Oh my God, it's the second best buttery experience I've ever had (I really can't mention the first in this review). The staff is friendly and attentive. I love it. From coffee to croissants, from soup to croque monsieur it is a wonderful cafe experience. Enjoy.
