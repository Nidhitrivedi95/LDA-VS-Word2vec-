t1mR_Zff6Dqv1TueE2JLEA The Sultan's Tent was the perfect place to host a friend's birthday. When we entered, we were immediately impressed by the dark ambiance and lavish decor of drapery and pillows.  My group was seated in a cozy corner offside the main floor where we had a great view of the belly dancers when the entertainment began. They even grabbed hold of our birthday girl, and we were able to take pictures of the action. 

The curtains separating table areas allow for privacy, and as you pull them back, it opens the space up to a more social and connected environment. The service was wonderful, very knowledgeable and attentive to our table, and the food was amazing!! I had the lamb with garlic potatoes and roasted veg, and it was cooked exactly the way I ordered. We also had the chevre crostini with red onions, a few salads, house cocktails and a seafood saffron dish that was great. So was the chocolate dessert and the delicious mint tea served at the end of the night!

The Sultan's Tent is great for celebrations, and we loved their sister location next door, Berber. I hope to be back soon!!
