gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg I've had both good and bad experiences at a few of the 3 Brasseurs locations. Overall, the beer is pretty good. I'm not a big beer drinker, so those who are really invested in it probably won't be too impressed. For me, it just has to be cold and crisp. Their pitchers are also a great deal for a group of friends going out.

The food has been tasty. I like the flamms, but it's better to just consider them as flatbread pizzas. I love the spicy sausage and pepper one, and it has been consistently delicious. I've also had really nice chicken Caesar salads, they throw some bacon in, and the lettuce has always been crispy and fresh. I had an incredible dessert once: just a simple apple pie and ice cream. So delicious. Unfortunately, it was seasonal and it wasn't there the next time I went back. I didn't expect this place to have great desserts, but I think they do.

Other times, the food has been bad. I had a chicken sandwich that was bland and missing (expensive) ingredients, namely the avocado. I tried a bite of a mac n cheese sandwich and how on God's green earth can you take the cheese flavor out of cheese?! Completely flavorless.

Service has also been hit or miss. I've had friendly, attentive service and I've had a waitress basically refuse to bring my visiting family English menus.
