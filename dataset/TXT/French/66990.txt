Tough thick starter bread
Didn't care for the garlic butter served with the bread.
Salad was a good portion and the dressing was light and flavorful. The croutons on the other hand were hard rocks and unpleasant. 
The wine list is extensive and impressive. We started with the pic poul font-mars, was a tastefully light start.
We ate outside and I didn't care for the dirty ceiling and ceiling fan. I kept worrying about the wind blowing the caked on dust off the fan and into my meal.
My lamb was cooked more medium well as opposed to the medium rare I ordered. I had to have it sent back and new one cooked. The new one was amazing. Also the chef took care of us in the bill for that. 
To touch the point of service again, it was amazing.
Erica they manager was a great manager and wonderful person to talk to about the meal. 
Dessert was the cheesecake and carrot cake. The cheesecake was light and more of a cream cheese taste.
Random but even the way the towels were folded in the mens restroom impressed me.
