We shared their popcorn which seems a little pricy for the amount you get. I had their pork belly dish and my cousin had their risotto and one of their salads. Both of us were pretty happy. The sauces that came with various things were super tasty and I love dipping things, always appreciated. It was a nice place to go before seeing a movie so high fives all around.
