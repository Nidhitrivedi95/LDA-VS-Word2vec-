Ht-_i0UAq7YDBaqJwcQMdQ OK, I agree that the food is great, but for the price and the reviews, I was expecting a bit better interior design.  The walls are painted dark gray, and there are exposed wires & speakers.  The "leather chairs" are basically just club chairs, which are OK, but not exceptional.  I can get better atmosphere in a Houstons.   I felt like I was in a "design on a dime" renovation that are supposed to look nice, but still pretty cheap.

I was disappointed in the glassware as well - the water glasses were these clunky amber glasses that you can find in a Sizzler.  The tables are very close together, and I was bothered by the fact that I had to bump up into someone else just to get into my seat.    Seriously, I could spruce this place with a quick trip to Target.   

Maybe my mistake is that I had high aspirations for Montreal cuisine having been to Toque (which blew my mind) and several other fantastic restaurants in the area.

As for the food - it was not over the top.  It definitely was excellent, well prepared, and relatively creative.    We did the tasting menu, and were served 4 courses.  The scallops were fantastic.  The risotto was perfectly cooked, and the boar was excellent.  I just didn't feel that it got the "over the top" rating that had been recommended.

I suggest that the owners remove a table or two, getting a "real" interior decorator, changing out the cheap glassware for glassware that goes with the wine and food, and paying attention to the details.  It's the little things that matter, and although they came through on the execution of the food, they lacked sufficient creativity, and skimped on the atmosphere.  

For almost $300, I expect top food, top service, and DETAILS.  Get the details right, and you get another star.  Wow me and you get another.
