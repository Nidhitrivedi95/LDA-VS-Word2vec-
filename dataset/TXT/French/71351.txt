xcmmTXhuMx2fZF2Bt69F4w One of the best of the best in Pittsburgh. The food and service is always consistent which is difficult to find in Pittsburgh. The mussels and frites are the main attraction of the restaurant but they also offer so much more during lunch, dinner, and brunch. My own complaint is that they don't accept reservations but if you get there before or after popular dining times, you won't have a long wait.
