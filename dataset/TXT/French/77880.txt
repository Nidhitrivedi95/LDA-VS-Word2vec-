YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g How about this for my 200th review!?

Throw out what you think of a Vegas resort restaurant.
Fleur merges a casual evening environment with a taste of fine dining for a totally worthwhile experience. 

I recommend that you read the whole menu, as there are amazing things "hidden" in there. It's just not what you expect.

I highly recommend the Ahi Tuna Tacos, House Special Fried Rice, and Sliders.
Good beer selection, excellent service (the GM and Chef  were stopping by tables checking on everyone), and an unmatched level of quality.
