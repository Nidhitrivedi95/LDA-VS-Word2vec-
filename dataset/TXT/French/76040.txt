ynYEgNimJOyb8dvyr9x0sA This is a really unique place for the West Valley!  The food is delicious, a decadent treat.  Crepes are not something that a lot of restaurants can do well and their buckwheat formula is really tasty and pretty healthy (it just gets unhealthy with what you put in them).  They also have an on tap beer selection that is quite different, opt for the sampler and try a range of these foreign, unheard of beers.  They really like details...from the ice cave to the fun bathrooms with windows...it becomes a dining experience.  I come here for what I call a "cheat meal" because I just have to also have a dessert on top of a beer and dinner.  Salted caramel fondue, are you kidding me...its crazy good, but I usually opt for the smores crepe (not on the menu but just ask for caramel, chocolate and coconut).  They will be moving Oct. 11 so give them a try soon at this well decorated location!
