3jKUbhGSjFTv5jZ0wnW0xA Les Deux Gamins was simply stunning. It was the perfect dinner to finish off the holiday. I wouldn't want to bore you with the details but the menu had a wide variety that I couldn't bring myself to choose what I wanted, therefore my friend and I settled for 5 different entrees that covered the spectrum of our cravings and we also had a bottle of wine to accompany all the exquisite dishes we were served.  
Merci Dounia because the service was excellent.
