Do. Not. Waste. Your. Money. Here. Just don't. 

The price tag on this meal is insane. It's 250.00 a person not including tax and tip. And the food while very pretty has few impressive ingredients. No delicious cuts of meat. One piece of meat and one piece of fish in the whole meal. And those were tiny. We dropped 1,000 for three people and we found ourselves hungry and eating again two hours later. 

The plating of the food is beautiful and it's fun to watch them prepare the plates. Problem with the food is that it lacks any soul. And for this kind of money you would expect some aged meat or lobster or something rare and delicious. Nope, none of that here. It was disappointing. 

The service besides the plating of the food is pretty bad. Again you would think they would treat you like kings. They don't. 

Lastly don't even think about celebrating a special occasion here. They will do nothing for you. In our case, we had two birthdays and we could have gone anywhere to celebrate it and we came here. And they knew. At least wish us happy birthday! So thumbs down for special occasions. 

Nothing about this experience other than the plating is special. So do yourself a favor and go spend the money at a beautiful steak house or get an incredible sushi meal. You'll have money left over for a show and an entire evening on the town.
