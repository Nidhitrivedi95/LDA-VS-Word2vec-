4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I was recommended this place by a friend knowing I was going to Las Vegas. The view was nice since it was across the street from the Bellagio and you can see the water show as a lot of reivewers were saying, this place was always packed every time I passed it on the strip. We were seated right away because of reservations, you def want to get a reservation if you don' t wait more than an hour. We sat inside only because I feel it's not very clean being outside, don't want random bugs in my food, or rain. 

We ordered the Bone-In Ribeye. Medium. Both of us, it comes with these flat crispy fries. I was in a a hoodie and jean shorts, and my husband was in a tshirt and khakis, we felt a little under dressed but no one said anything, there were others who had casual clothes on too, but it would be a nice place to dress up to also. 

My Ribeye tasted like a sirloin. I wanted medium but it tasted like medium well done. It was hard and grimy. I didn't like it. The fries were ok,  I was too embarrassed to ask for ketchup. hahah. 

First time here, I'm not sure what else I'd order next time if I ever came back, Maybe try breakfast, I just thought this was an ok place to go. I'm a meat eater so everything else on the menu I didn't care for. 

I had an overpriced steak for sure. Even texas road house steak tasted better. So much for $40 steak.
