dd3GZs6zW2t7BM0cbxAzvg I'm a regular here, thought it about time I write a proper review.

I go here for one reason: only place I know that does a great job with game meats. This is not a spot for vegetarians. Their mixed grill will offer things like wild boar, muskox, etc and is spectacular. 

Also, Sunday brunch is a favorite of mine here; only place in the city that has eggs benny with wild game (venison, cheval, etc). The escargot is excellent as well.

So what else? Wine list = great. Service = great. This is just a reliable spot for great food and vibe. 

Only complaint I have is the bread. For a place where every dish is generally great, the bread is almost always stale or just plain bad.
