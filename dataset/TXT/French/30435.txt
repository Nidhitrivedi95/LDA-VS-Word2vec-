FUX9h1a37GJn9ge1baiNuw So far, I've had croissants of various sorts and baguettes from La Baguette. They have been outstanding! The baguettes are crusty but soft and wonderful inside. My 11-year-old rates the pain au chocolat (chocolate croissants) her all-time favorite. Good coffee, too. A pleasant place to sit down for a little meal or snack.
