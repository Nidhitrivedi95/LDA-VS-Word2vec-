IUtjbbqQ6jUSi4t2jjgYRA This place has the best Quiche I have ever tasted. Best, ever. Light and delicious. The food here on a whole is delicious and so very homemade, if your home includes two Michelin-eaque French chefs. But really I mean homemade in that the menu changes every week and you can tell it's all done with love and on a somewhat small scale considering it's apparently been around for a while. Lovely neighborhood café. I recommend everything but especially the Quiche! 
Oh, and it can take a while from ordering to sitting so maybe be prepared for that. And as others have mentioned, seating is minimal. Enjoy!
