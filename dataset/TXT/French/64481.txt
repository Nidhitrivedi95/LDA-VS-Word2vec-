tCSlpwJQ4CZsUEMZeH2SFg I've been to Cafe Monte quite a few times for brunch- so I can't review any other meals.  It is a great place to meet your girlfriends to have brunch and then head next door to Polished Nail Salon for pedicures. ;) I love their french toast, and have heard my friends rave about the eggs benedict.  I definitely recommend this restaurant for a nice, relaxed brunch.  The weekends can get very busy, but I've never had to wait very long to be seated.  Good service, nice ambiance.
