jLxeBgWhLRbII2ACkgH1Sg I have recently moved to Las Vegas area. This is my third time visiting here and now I'm hooked! There are SO many choices of pastries, drinks, etc. Everything is fresh and never nuked by a microwave.
I try something new each time and am satisfied. Oh and I love their espresso!!! So bold and strong. 
Their workers are very knowledgable and kind. Claudiu let me sample a sort of chocolate chip and pecan cookie and it was delicious! I'll keep coming back for the amazing treats and service.
