4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I absolutely LOVE this place!! My friend took me here for an early birthday treat and we had the best experience anyone could imagine. Our server, Billy, was so welcoming, down to earth and funny, I wanted him to be my bestfriend! Haha

Anyways, the food was amazing. I don't remember what I ordered exactly but I know I got a medium rare steak, my friend ordered a steak sandwich with fries and both were cooked perfectly. Everything about this restaurant is perfect to be completely honest. The view, food, and customer service. I HIGHLY recommend and I will definitely come back!
