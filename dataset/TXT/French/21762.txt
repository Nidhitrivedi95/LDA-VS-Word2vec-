Bf-yMQiSmDZyqfGyFKQ0bA We went to this restaurant, two mother-daughter pairs, for dinner before a 7:15 movie.  The bar-like environment and under-stated exterior would normally have deterred us, but we were seated by a friendly server within about 10 minutes.  It was truly a hometown Pittsburgh hang-out with all ages patronizing the place.  We ate the smoked chicken tacos and the reuben.  They were great, and our waitress was able to tell me that the chicken dish was gluten-free (having just been checked the night before for another customer).  The food arrived in a timely manner, with enough time to get to the movie theatre on time.  We will return.
