rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I had breakfast here with a party of 10, and we ordered a basket of pastries. We were able to choose 3: Pain au Chocolat, Almond Brioche, and Cheese Danish. All tasty. 

The first thing I noticed was that the tables are designed really well so that, even in big parties, you can have a solid conversation with anyone else at the table. Most places only offer long tables, which splits the group in two unless you walk around the table to talk to the other side. So, I definitely recommend this place for larger groups. 

But, the service at this place was really weird. The lady insisted that we tell her our order consecutively and she was really anal about that. I didn't like her attitude. They were really slow in bringing out my cousin's mimosa after everyone else received theirs. This could partly be because one of our party was being a little tenacious about every little thing. Still, part of great customer service is to deal with it graciously.

I really like their Bellini wine drink. 

The pastries were amazing. My cousin ordered the French Toast, and it looked a little soggy. 

Meh, overall it's okay. I wasn't blown away. I do have to say they were nice enough to split the check in half. They said they can split checks up to 3 ways.
