O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q I actually give Morels 4 1/2 stars. The prior Yelp reviews I read were very helpful in deciding to go there last Friday night. The place was very empty for 8 pm but that just works for us in better service. The service gets 5 stars. Our waiter was very attentive and patient, answering my numerous questions about their rather large menu. We started with the cheese fondue and it was great. Next, we split the Kansas City steak and lobster special. I thought it was one of the best steaks I've ever had, just perfectly cooked, not fatty, and juicy. The Pommes Frites were solid but nothing special. We ended with the chocolate souffle and it didn't disappoint. With two glasses of red wine, the total was under 200 bucks with 30% tip which is a bargain in my eyes. What kept it from being a 5 star meal was that you could see the Pirate Show at the Treasure Island and that took away from the ambience in my opinion.
