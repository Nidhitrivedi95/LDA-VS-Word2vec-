rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w oh Le Cirque! Yes~ They can cook!!! The food is amazing and everything else is great too.  The setting is very intimate, and you will have a wonderful time there if you enjoy fine dining.  My dinner there was very very satisfying.  I would definitely go back for more. oh I shouldn't forget to mention~ their souffle is the best!
