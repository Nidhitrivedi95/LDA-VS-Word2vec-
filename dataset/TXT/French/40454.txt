KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA Went with a party of 4 for Saturday lunch and it was excellent.  We had multiple apps and entrees; escargot (excellent), french onion soup (excellent), pumpkin soup (excellent), Caesars salad (good), charcuterie plate (skip this, a bit bleak for the price), lobster salad croissant (good), blackened salmon BLT (excellent), mussels (excellent) and pork belly ravioli (excellent).  The waitress was very nice and professional, although there were a few lengthy waits between visits.  This may have been since we were the only group inside.  Overall: great.
