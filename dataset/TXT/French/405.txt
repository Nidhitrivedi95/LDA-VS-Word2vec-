-gSmWgHBhIU-l7GFs1C7ew As a native Montrealer, this is one of my fav restaurants. This is saying a lot, since there are a ton of good restaurants in Montreal.

Food is terrific - while the menu doesn't change often, they always manage to do each dish slightly differently. The warm goat cheese salad is to die for, and the duck is always delicious. My boyfriend is obsessed with the smoked fish entree.

The service is also good - the head waiter now remembers us, and always makes a point to say hello. It is always packed in there, so sometimes the service can be a bit slow.

The fact that it is BYOB is perfect. Love this place!
