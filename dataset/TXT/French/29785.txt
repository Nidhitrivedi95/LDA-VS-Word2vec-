FgSFHWxlSDCbmSKmzKCYog The one in the scottsdale mall is still there hopefully, I love this chain, their french roast coffee is great, though pricey but most importantly the thing that made me move to PHX in the first place, their creme brulee tart, ohhhhh the breakfast of a century, so beautiful you are, I want to have you every morning for the rest of my life, I miss u sooooo, their napoleans are great too. Of all the things I remember from living in PHX for 2 years, this is the only memorable place, sad huh?
