pRlO48w4GkWEPEYIH2tHsw I've been to many a Mimi.  I've yet to be disappointed at any of them, this location is no exception.  

Took my daughter and sis for brunch.  I had the cajun chicken sausage and eggs with a pumpkin muffin.  it comes with a glass of oj - cost $9.50 .  it's actually a good deal considering the OJ - do you see what they charge for a glass of OJ at Denny's - holy cow ! Though i gotta admit, the sausage sure tasted like something i bought at trader joes a few months ago.

sis' eggs benedict - just ok - ham slice too thick and a little too salty.  not enough hollandaise sauce.

Daughters chicken pesto ciabatta - big sammie - love  the pesto !

i tell ya one thing - the location is a little odd - at the far end of this huge shopping center - and let me tell you, the access to the center sucks big time.
