JezHN-9KKLTMbojq00VP0g Went here for lunch on a weekday. The food was just awesome! The portion was large enough but I also ordered a cup of soup. The soup was creamy and buttery and the entree was cooked to perfection and seasoned very well. The only draw back is how tiny the seating area is. Love it and we'll go back.
