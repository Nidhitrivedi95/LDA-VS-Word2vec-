DZkl5MleRKh0isxj1Y2Abg Love this small restaurant! Kitchen is small but very efficient. Servers are very professional.  Must make reservations because tables always fill up fast if not. This is the second time I came and the quality is still excellent.  I really like the mushrooms dish and their apple tarte. The fish seafood soup "ttoro" is also a must try;  the fish soup base has the extracted fish taste but not very heavy. I would say the whole menu is excellent and delicious. Recommend to bring your date here!
