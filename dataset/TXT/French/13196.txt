If you're willing to eat inside, you will likely be seated right away. The service is quick and pleasant. The food is amazing! I ordered the Bananas Foster Waffle, which was good, but my friend's Eggs Benedict with short rib stole the show. It may be the best eggs benedict I've ever had. I highly recommend ordering one of the chef's specials!
