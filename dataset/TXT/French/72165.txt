XKPosZx2j4RHcZ8Ewdwj0A I'm not going to compare Leméac to other French restaurants in the city. In a city as eclectic as Montreal where French roots are evident and serve a predominant role in the culinary landscape, it's hard to avoid getting muddled and folded into the rest of the group, however, this is exactly how the better joints will stand out. When you have many places doing the same thing, it's the chef's responsibility to ensure that his or her cuisine and menu choices stand out - only on an even playing field where everyone is doing the same thing, will you find who is truly doing it better. With Leméac's given history, they are certainly keeping the bar set high and standards even higher.
