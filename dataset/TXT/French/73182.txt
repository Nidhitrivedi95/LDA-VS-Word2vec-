xNnZ5ksBY1gwwTV2Btb4Ag I don't usually review any restaurants unless it is "Exquisite". This place has surpassed that. From the daily changing menu based on local demand, to the homey ambience, big wine selection list, they have exceeded expectations. This is by far the best French restaurant experience I have ever had. It's a package. The servers are amazing. Food enriches you and it goes beyond fulfillment. The lamb Tatare absolutely just melts in your mouth. Savour what I just said. Let this really sink in.
