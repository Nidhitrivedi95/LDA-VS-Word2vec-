SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA below is my original review. have been back a couple of times since and it's just ok. in NYC you'd be over. makes me sad. over steamed artichoke and ammoniated skate. desserts a loser. why? in better news the roast chicken was very good and we also liked the escargot...

-----------------------------------------

loved it. really loved it. it's just right. we were a table of 4 and all the food was great. the ONLY thing that was a major creep out was the painting over the fireplace. it is SO AWFUL that i couldn't stop looking at it. really bizarre choice. but back to the food... it's french bistro food and again, really well done. the menu doesn't miss a thing. to be honest, it was about 2 months ago that we went but i am really wanting to go back and soon... realized it when we ate at le petit triangle the other day, just zero comparison. l'albatros kicked its ass.
