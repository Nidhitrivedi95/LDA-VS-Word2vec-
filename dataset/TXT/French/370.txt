-ClafaRWkSRTfieIzO4r3Q Went on a Saturday night with a reservation. Service was horrendous. If you can't handle a full restaurant on a Saturday night, just close the doors now there is no point is trying. It took 30 minutes and asking 3 times to get a glass of water. Both tables on either side were literally monitoring when a waiting came with water so they could all get some before he disappeared again. Bad service is tolerable if the food is great, but food was adequate at best. With great restaurants like playa cabana and Nodo less than 2 min away handling packed houses every night, there is no excuse for bad service on a Saturday night. With better options in the area, will not return
