qTacF-_Iucc1Nxom_Za_5Q Had the grand Aioli and steelhead trout, among a handful of other dishes. Pretty underwhelming flavour wise, and given that you are looking at small bite size portions, just way over priced. Happy to pay a premium when the flavour is like bar raval, but bar raval this is not. That being said, the folks were nice. A little frustrating you can't put your name down for a wait list - maybe text me? Call me? We have these wonderful cellphone things ... Let's use them?
