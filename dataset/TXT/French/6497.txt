4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw A very nice dining experience.  Mon Ami Gabi is a restaurant I have visited a handful of times over the years, and actually a place I would visit even if staying at a different hotel not adjacent to Paris.  It has a very 'authentic' bistro feel to it, and a nice menu overall.  The menu is steak-hevay, but there are a few other assorted items- this past visit I had a very nice sole special.  Appetizers are nice- in particular the baked goat cheese in tomato sauce, the escargot, and the onion soup.  I'll be back for sure.
