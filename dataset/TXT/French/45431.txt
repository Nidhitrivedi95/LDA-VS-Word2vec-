You like sweetbreads?  Order it.  The best I've ever had.  

The hamachi and uni was yummy.  One plate isn't enough.  

Their homemade bread was delicious.  I wanted to keep eating them but had to put a stop.  

The steak was very good, but it's just not fair to compare Wagyu with Kobe (in Kobe).  I always compare.  

Surprisingly, I didn't love the puréed potatoes which is something they are known for, go figure.  My husband enjoyed them though.  

Service was top notch.  Not overbearing, but attentive and informative.
