We made reservations for 8p but after a long day out on the Strip, we pushed it back to 9p.

Arrived and we were asked whether we still wanted to sit inside or out on the patio. Since I knew the Bellagio Fountains' show began at 9p, we opted for the patio. The patio had heaters, which was awesome since I had a sleeveless dress on. We lucked out and got a table smack dab in the middle of the patio with prime views of the Bellagio and a wonderful view of the Eiffel Tower. It was AMAZING!!!

The service from Marlon was great! Recommendations were made and questions answered. 

-Couple glasses of house Pinots ($15)
-Filet ($32)
-Hanger Steak ($20)
-Special Bread Pudding ($9)
Total was $82, plus a generous tip.

Steak frites accompanied the steaks and they were yum! I had the filet, and I have to admit, I had to struggle a bit for a clean cut. The hanger had really good seasoning and flavor. When I order dessert, it HAS to be with some type of chocolate. HOWEVER, since the bread pudding was seasonal, we opted to be different and try it. It was warm goodness!!! I would have probably requested a side of hot fudge, but oh well.

The service and ambiance truly deserves a 5 star rating. Unfortunately, I expected more with my steak. Would love to come back and try their fresh fish.
