4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw My GOD I love this restaurant.

I try and eat at Mon Ami Gabi every time I visit Las Vegas. The food is incredible and the view of the Bellagio fountains is unbelievable.

It's a French-style Steakhouse -- which to me means, super thin, tender (almost like flank steak) served with pomme frittes (super thin, crispy fried potatoes). They give you the option of sauces to drizzle over your steak...two of my favorites are the red wine and the béarnaise. Totally, completely delicious!
