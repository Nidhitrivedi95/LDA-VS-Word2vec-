jLxeBgWhLRbII2ACkgH1Sg Coming from Switzerland and having been to France for nearly all my childhood vacations I was craving for some actual actual bread. When I moved to this neighborhood, La Belle Terre was one of the first stops I made. And boy was I impressed!
Their food is fresh and always tastes good. I've not had anything bad and I am going there about once every week. But let me write a bit more about what you get

The Food
=======

This is a french bakery, although it does serve a bit more than just bread. One can get several different sandwiches, salads and, during the winter time, a soup. Although I would appreciate if they were to offer the soup through the summer too, as I don't see a point in making a difference in Vegas ... They have delicious coffee, which I find increasingly hard to find in the US and great drinks. Nearly always there's a little water dispenser where one can get a small cup of water. If it's not around they'll offer water on request (although I've only had that once).

The Staff
=======

The all are very friendly. Sometimes they are a bit slow when there are a lot of costumers, but it's no big deal. I've yet to wait more than 15 minutes on any item I've ordered.
They are attentive and have yet to be rude to a customer while I was there. You can ask them for advice and they tell you about their desserts and their menu with a friendly and open attitude. I've come to miss that in Vegas as more than not people here are a tad bit cold.

Conclusion
=========

I love this place and would bring anyone here. I'd recommend it to anyone that has a few minutes time to sit down and enjoy one of their sandwiches or pastries. They also do special orders on request which is great for parties and events.
One thing that might improve this place would be a few options for sugar free desserts and gluten free bread. But alas, it IS a french bakery, so that request might not be heard :)

Again: Definitely go here if you're around the area and have a few minutes to spare! This place is THE BEST bakery in Vegas!
