rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A While in Las Vegas for business my colleague and I decided that we'd use our company food reimbursement solely on our dinner (breakfast and lunch were being provided so this left a good amount of money).  We searched on Yelp and found Bouchon - and how can you go wrong with anything Thomas Keller?  In San Francisco we can't get foie gras and I hadn't ever tried it before but was excited to - it was absolutely delicious!  We also shared the gnocchi (which is pasta rather than potato) and the beef short ribs - both were spectacular.  I had a glass of red wine which was delicious even though it was one of the less expensive choices - I especially enjoy when a restaurant will serve good wines that are less costly.  I would definitely go back again.
