rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A After an evening of dancing the night away, my girlfriends and I had a beautiful "ladies" brunch at Bouchon. We were celebrating my birthday and everything was perfect. I made reservations on Open Table and they have us a table at the far corner of the restaurant so we could observe the entire place and all four of us fit onto the wall seating of the table--cafe/bistro style. 

We ordered the mussels as a light app--they were a bit small but perfect and slightly sweet. I had the steak frites--I ordered it medium rare but it came medium. It was yummy anyway and since it was my birthday I didn't make a peep to the waiter about it. It came with a mountain of french fries--very nice and 2 of my friends were munching with me.  YL ordered the trout which I thought was the best dish that any of us had ordered.  A whole trout filleted and quite tender, topped with some green beans and sliced roasted almonds. The combination was divine. 

The best was that after our meal the waiter presented me with a cake with a pink candle (I love pink!)  that said "Happy Birthday" and had my name on it!   It wasn't just a slice of cake for me, but a long elegant chocolate hazelnut cake for me and my friends!!!  It came from the bakery downstairs in the Venetian.  

We all left happy and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is staying at the Venetian. Plus, it isn't very expensive for lunch.
