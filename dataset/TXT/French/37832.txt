jaSowNITPRRCYpPb3_pjdA I feel very fortunate to have a restaurant with food this good so close to home. The service standards and hospitality layered in on top make this a real blessing. Oysters were fresh and ice cold, escargots were piping hot any garlicky ( I suggest some fries for the extra butter ), the foie gras sear was a perfect mahogany with just the perfect balance is sweet and savory. For entrees I loved the house-made sausages or the trout amandine but the roasted chicken was also great. If you do nothing else though you have to try the walnut gateaux & apple tarte tatin.
