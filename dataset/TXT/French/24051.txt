cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg We went to dinner at PDC on a Saturday night. We had seats at the bar which was perfect given a superb bartender / waiter and getting to see the hustle and bustle of a very involved staff. Our server was extremely helpful in recommending dishes and highly recommended the veal shank for two and the crab and cucumber salad. First - the salad was super fresh and the crab ultra tender and flavorful. The veal shank was gigantic. It came served on a huge platter with polenta, red wine Demi glaze sauce fois gras sauce and these awesome pin wheel vegetables. The shank was braised and fall of the bone tender and juicy. Amazing meat. We couldn't finish but were highly satisfied although my wife thought while perfectly prepared the meat was a little bland. The bread we got in the beginning of the meal was also great. Served hot it was crusty and soft with yeasty slightly salty goodness. For desert we had the pecan pie with vanilla ice cream which I looved. It was flaky and the pecans crisp and gooey at the same time and the ice cream proved the perfect compliment. It would have better if it was served warm but not a huge deal. We had wonderful glasses of red wine through he evening. I'd highly recommend PDC to anyone on a trip to Montreal.
