The waitress had really good recommendations and I ended up trying and loving foods that I would not have generally ordered.  The liver pate in the meat appetizer was really good, and I generally have an extremely negative attitude about liver.  My friends and I order 4 dishes and shared them.  I tried duck confit, and pork belly for the first time.  Plus we order tried and true favorites like steak and pork loin.  My absolute favorite dish was the duck confit.  At the end of the meal the owner/chef came out and answered some of our questions.  He was very talented and I could appreciate his love for what he is doing.  The food is all locally raised and grown and the prices are right on.  I highly recommend the Black Pig!
