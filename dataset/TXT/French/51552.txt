pKiSzUlBBRNEdTML24piXA I will definitely be back. Our service was off- appetizer ordered didn't make it in, as well as one of the entrees. Someone came over and offered to take the appetizer off the bill which we thought was very nice. However, when we received the bill it was still on it. Not the best. 

Everything we had was delicious though. There was a dessert that we had heard about that wasn't on the menu that night. They were nice enough to whip one up for us which was appreciated. A neat spot- could have been a 5 star experience if the service wasn't so off.
