or4UVDjXEEjze3wNPjoAZA I like the atmosphere and the service.  Ashley attended to two of us on Friday night, in a wonderfully professional manner.   She allowed us to taste 2 wines before we settled on a bottle choice.  I  recall it was a bordeaux (and offered by the glass)  at the $60 point and very drinkable.

I had a special of the evening, the veal chop.  And I always enjoy a good veal chop when offered.  It was a nice piece of meat an cooked expertly accompanied by some mushrooms and sauce.  The only drawback of the dish was the side potatoes were only warm at best accompanying the dish.  

Also ordered were the scallops which were again very well prepared and served.

 Good work Zinc, see you in a future visit!
