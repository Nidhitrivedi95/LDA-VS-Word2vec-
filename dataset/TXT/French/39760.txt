K2C8dSx9215LLcIzHL959Q Dinner last night at the Twisted Frenchman was the best in recent memory. It's a tiny, modern place inconveniently located in Shadyside/Wilkensburg. Service was outstanding, beginning with the greeting/seating/watering all the way through paying. Extreme attention to detail is evident throughout the experience, including furnishings, plating the wonderful food, and even presentation of the bill.

The food was outstanding. We shared the excellent beet appetizer and each ordered the Poulet Rouge, a chicken dish with stuffing and truffles which, amazingly, was worth every cent of the $42 price. We shared the freezing chocolate desert, which is part plate-licking liquid chocolate delight and part dramatic performance by the chef-owner.

The wine list is all French, very good but also pricey.

Overall it was an extraordinary dining experience which could only be improved with convenient parking options and a few moderately priced California Chardonnays on the wine list. It's a special place for special occasions.
