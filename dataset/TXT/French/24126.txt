cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg Three of us ate dinner at Au Pied du Cochon.  The food was a novelty.  I'd call it country Quebecois food, with lots of use of fats, foie gras, and various kinds of meats.  We also had a tomato soup special offered that night which, of course, had foie gras in it as well as some kind of sausage.  It was quite good.  We liked the duck in a can with its generous portion of foie gras (100g, I think) and the medium rare duck meat.  One of us had the chicken entrée (pees, bread, and gravy) and did not care for it.   We had no room for dessert.  Our waiter helped to pick a nice red wine ($54, one of the least expensive bottles available).  Leave any notions of healthiness at the door and enjoy the decadence of a fat laden meal.  The restaurant itself was often too noisy for conversation, made worse by loud music.  The décor was simple wood with horizontal mirrors.  The simple un-interesting décor did not fit the cost or effort put into the food.  We enjoyed going for the novelty and the sense of a Quebecois experience but would not go again.  It is not a fine dining experience.
