4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw This was a spur of the moment decision restaurant on a Saturday morning and I am so glad that we came!

The atmosphere of the whole place was fantastic, I loved sitting in the windowed patio because we got to see the street but still be in AC, which is very key in September in Vegas.

The food was to die for, everything was out of this world. I got the apple waffles and did not regret it! They were perfect and even better than I had imagined! The homemade whipped cream is some of the best I had ever had in my whole life, and I am a whipped cream expert!

The service was great, our waitress was super kind and informative, our drinks never went unfilled!

The reason I am taking a star off is because of their seating policy.
We didn't make a reservation and when we came up they said they had seating for us but wouldn't sit us until the entire party was present. Which makes sense, but my 80 year old grandmother was with us and she has some severe walking issues and therefore was quite slow and a bit behind the front of the group. It was just frustrating to have been made to feel we had to either rush our grandmother or risk not getting a seat. Perhaps they should consider reviewing that policy when it comes to special circumstances.
