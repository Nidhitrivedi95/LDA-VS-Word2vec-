fyJAqmweGm8VXnpU4CWGNw I recently discovered French Grocery on Yelp and couldn't wait to visit. I have been there several times in the past two weeks. In a word, fantastic! It just really doesn't get any better than this.  

The owner Kevin is an experienced and talented chef from New Orleans. His passion for Creole cuisine is apparent. He seems happiest when spending time talking to his customers about the food he and his team are creating. 

Today for lunch I had a shrimp salad. It was very simple. Spinach leaves, red bell pepper, corn, boiled shrimp and vinaigrette. What made this salad different than any other with the same ingredients is the care taken to get it right. It was love on a plate. The spinach was properly washed and dried. The corn was a tasty and colorful addition. The best part were the shrimp. Four lovely shrimp that were cooked to perfection and seasoned in a way that made me very happy! These were not common boiled shrimp. They were poached in a liquid that brought a lot of flavor. There was a sweet spice present that I am still thinking about and craving. Maybe allspice or nutmeg. They were delicious!

Kevin is creating take home meals, many with Creole flavors. French onion soup, red beans and rice, English pea and mint soup. It goes on and on. 

I can't wait to see what French Grocery brings in the future. 

Bienvenue a Arizona French Grocery! Thank you for being here and bringing to our community some Creole goodness.

I look forward to spending many happy hours in your French Grocery.
