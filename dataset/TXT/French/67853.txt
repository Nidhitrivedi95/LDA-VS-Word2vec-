V0iYi5OjdRcz82m95jV7vQ I made a special cake order and I am happy to say I will be ordering the same cake yet again! All everyone could say was WOW! My Spanish Fruitcake was excellent, the chef was pleasant and assured me he could handle the order and it would be great, and he did not disappoint! Prices to me are reasonable as well. Keep it up, Renaissance!
