4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw We figured....last minute ressie, not crowded....random Paris hotel location, french steakhouse, whatever, I *guess* it'll be an OKAY dinner.

Not so much, it was absolutely wonderful! We all shared a bunch of things and left fat, happy and shocked it was so affordable given how we all rolled outta there.

Quick service...cocktails were super fun, dessert chocolate mousse and profiteroles amazing...steak succulent and done perfectly, appetizers were OHHHHH good, and the WARM BAGUETTES OF BREAD delivered to your table 3 at a time????? Heaven, how did they know I am a carb whore....more please.
