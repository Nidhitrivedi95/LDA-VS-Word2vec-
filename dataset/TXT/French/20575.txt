AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw Being from New York, I have tried several of Chef François Payard's fabulous pastries, chocolates, and other treats.  His bistro in Caesars Palace serves everything from breads to truffles - essentially everything you need to satisfy your carbohydrate and sweet cravings.  

My friend and I stopped into the cafe after dinner to sample the gelato and sorbet, which were both fantastic!  The gelato was creamy and decadent, while the sorbet was packed with ripe fruit flavor.

Payard Patisserie is definitely one of the top dessert spots on the Strip, so be sure to check it out.  The treats are the perfect evening alternative to a crazy night out at the clubs.
