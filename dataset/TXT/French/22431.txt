BSmqxPbQglQwP2R56OqOag I found the quality fine (not spectacular) but way overpriced for pasta.  I certainly appreciate fine Italian food, but this didn't fall into that category.  I think a better matched price for what I got would have brought me back.  As it currently stands, I wouldn't spend that much money for this.  Their service was intermittent at best.  I realize it was a Saturday night but isn't that what they want and should expect on the weekend?
