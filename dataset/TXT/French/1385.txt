_T7f2wUgNlJqxsR-cR89SQ After reading all those reviews saying "worth every penny", "perfect experience", etc., my expectations were quite high - but, with high-end restaurants you are threading at that dangerous slope of the cost/return ratio where a giant leap in price does not necessarily translates into a giant leap in food/service. 

Scaramouche did some things quite well, such as a surprisingly flavourful and well balanced amuse-bouche and a really good lamb. Some other dishes were merely OK, like our dessert. But then it failed in very basic things, like missing the cooking point of my wife's fillet mignon. This is unacceptable. To make matters worse, the waiter did not come to our table to ask about how our food was - in fact he barely took time servicing our table or going through the menu options.

I would leave a 4 stars review had our dinner been "just OK", but those rookie mistakes are hard to forgive.
