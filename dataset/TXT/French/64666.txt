Tefx_N6A6nrsdj4jHHnbYg I felt compelled to write a review at this very moment because I just ate one of their lemon macarons ($2.55 each) and it was one of the best macarons I've ever had. So good! I've also tried the strawberry and chocolate macarons which are delicious as well. Bonus - the macarons are all gluten free.

This place is cute and spacious and is a great spot to chat with friends or plug into your laptop and get some work done (they have wi-fi). The coffee is really good. My daily coffee is usually iced coffee with extra cream. Here, it's a latte ($4.00) which is significantly more expensive for me than my go-to but it's definitely worth it!

Aside from the coffee and macarons, my brother and I have both tried some of their savory dishes. He's had the Roast Beef Au Jus Sandwich ($7.95) and I've had the Apple, Brie, and Almond Salad ($5.95). We both agree that the food is quite good and the prices are great.

I definitely recommend this place! I will probably be back tomorrow to try a different macaron flavor :)
