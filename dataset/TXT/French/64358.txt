tCSlpwJQ4CZsUEMZeH2SFg I was very excited to try Cafe Monte I can't really give a full review since I didn't eat a real meal here so I'll be back soon.  The outdoor patio is very nice and the service was excellent.  The desserts when you walked in looked amazing (note to self for my next visit).  The menu had the traditional french dishes and they had a nice special on a Prosecco which was just what I was in the mood for.  I opted for the endive salad I would highly recommend it was delicious and shared a meat and cheese plate that was nothing spectacular and fairly pricey.  I'm coming back to try some mussels for sure and maybe brunch:)
