rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw Definitely one of the better brunches I've experienced in Vegas. So far I've done Caesars palace buffet and one at Wynn and if someone made me chose between those again I'd goose this one! The pictures don't do the French toast justice IT'S HUGE. enjoyed the French omelette. It is simple the Brie is in there somewhere but can def taste it. Comes with hash brown in a square form that has a herb in it that I can't pinpoint. All the food is delightfully different.
