YUFxSG6idHePsxOmnSHtpQ I have been a loyal patron of Mimi's Cafe in Chandler for about 12 years. Unfortunately the quality of the food and service has been truly awful for about the last year. I keep trying because I remember all the good meals we've had there but the last 3 times have been so awful that I will not be back. Ordered an old favorite..pot roast. It came out cold and dried out. Next time I ordered the beef bourguinon which turned out to be cold dry pot roast with a wine sauce poured over it. I was offered another choice so I took the pork chops. They came out in about 5 minutes raw. The manager came over and said she was sorry and that I wouldn't be charged for the meal. No kidding.  Last week I tried again. This time I ordered fish and chips because my wife told me she would divorce me if I ordered anything remotely related to pot roast. The fish came out overcooked and dried out which required tearing it apart rather than breaking apart in like most flaky fish does. I ordered garlic sweet potato fries with the fish which turned out to be cold soggy non garlic fries. When I questioned the waiter he told me that sweet potato fries were supposed to be soft cuz they don't fry crispy. I told him to ask the kitchen to try again which they did and were delicious the second time. Too little too late
