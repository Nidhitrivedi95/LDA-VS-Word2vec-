n4uDGwRGtJ3vW2Adbha_wg We stopped here for dinner on a recent trip to Montreal, and it was honestly one of the worst experiences I've had eating out in a long time.

Our server was rude and took forever to bring us drinks. We proceeded to order, and our food took a similar eternity to come out (despite the restaurant being mostly empty). When it did come out, several people didn't receive their salads and others ONLY received salads. When we inquired, our rude waiter informed us that other people would get their entrees later (after everyone else had finished eating). I stated that I didn't want to receive my entree late, and they ignored my request and brought it anyway, forcing me and one other person to eat while everyone stared at us. 

To cap everything else off, when we attempted to pay for our meal, our change was withheld as the waiter attempted to shame us into tipping. Then, when we demanded change, they informed us that they didn't have enough cash to break the bill. So, we ended up getting shortchanged. 

Avoid at all costs.
