aW6Z4NSqEVli-xYMV3jRyg I've been back twice for their three course meal. I just love the steak! The steak from the angel hair basket isn't as tender or flavorful as this. It's perfectly seasoned with mustard and some other ingredients. It's served with goat cheese mashed potatoes which are also heavenly. Everything goes so well with the sauce. It is truely an amazing dish.

I'm still not so sure about their appitizers and desserts though. I enjoy the taste of fried foie gras but their appitizer is served as is. The souflee is amazing and chocolate tartes are very delicious but over powered my steak. Maybe next time I'll order just the steak, two of them.

I went on a Monday and they had only a handful of tables avaliable. The server told me every Monday and Thursday (I believe) most of the restaurant is booked by companies. I suggest to come on other days.

The meal was only $25! That's a great deal.
