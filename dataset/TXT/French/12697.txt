4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw The 7 of us went for our Thanksgiving dinner (without a reservation!) and was seated close to the window with a fabulous view of the Bellagio fountains. The lights were so dim that I had a hard time looking at the menu but guess that's part of the romantic atmosphere. 

Started off with the Escargots de Bourgogne and the Shrimp Gabi. Both were delicious. 

The steaks all came with a generous helping of Frites. Good amount of steak for the price. They were all prepared the way we had requested.  I had the New York Strip Steak prepared rare.  That was one big stripe!  It had to have been an inch thick.  The baguettes were warm, fresh and crunchy on the outside. Our waiter was quick and courteous. 

Overall it was a great experience. Prices were decent plus you get that great view.  Service was great.  Food was great.  Only complaint is the extremely dim lighting.
