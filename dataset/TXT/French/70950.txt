xcmmTXhuMx2fZF2Bt69F4w Nice ambience..house special was potato pancakes..probably the only thing we did not enjoy on the menu..pretty much everything else was nicely presented and delicious..we had a veggie frittata which came with arugula on the top which was good..grilled cheese with rye bread with just the right amount of cheese..the omelette special with fruits..but the best thing was the waffle with fruits...the best waffles we have ever had..def burley try that..my habanero margarita was amazing..definitely try..
