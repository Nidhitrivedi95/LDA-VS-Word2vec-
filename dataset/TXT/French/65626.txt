We started with a tasty platter of cheeses which included four local cheeses I forget the names of. Except for brie, all others were new and I quite enjoyed them, especially the goat cheese variant.

We had a variety of mains. I got the pasta Arrabbiata(don't know why I order that dish), and it was expectedly very ordinary. Others in our group got mussels and a quarter chicken respectively. Overall the portions were decent and the food was A-OK.
