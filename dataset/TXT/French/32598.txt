gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg Nice pub/bar along the main street. We were initially attacked to sit at the bar by the lovely Sabrina who pulled two terrific pints for us. The beer was excellent and fresh. The view at the bar was also excellent and fresh. I'd come back here again.

Nice seating area facing the street so that you can watch the people go by as you're enjoying your drink and/or meal.
