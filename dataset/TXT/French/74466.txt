xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g I took my girlfriend here to celebrate her birthday. It was a Wednesday night, but I made reservations in advance just in case. When I made the reservation online, I advised them of the occasion and asked for a fountain view. 

Upon arriving, the experience and the view were fantastic from beginning to end. This place is fine dining at its finest. The service was amazing. The host who greeted us once the elevator doors opened was a nice touch. The waiter was fantastic, very attentive, very friendly. He remembered to bring out a birthday dessert without me having to remind him. The support staff came by several times to check on us, offer us bread, etc., and never let our water glasses get less than half full. I appreciated the supervisor, Lyle, coming by to check on us, and his thank you email after the fact was a nice touch. 

I had the New York Steak, my girlfriend had the chicken, both were delicious. The pistachio souffle was to die for. 

It was pricey, to be sure, but you get what you pay for. I wanted it to be a special experience for my girlfriend and the Eiffel Tower Restaurant did not disappoint.
