ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug Came for a late breakfast and waited a long time for our food. Our waitress was not very attentive and came by to take our order and not again until the food came out. It does not take that long to cook breakfast food. Once the food came the egg was slightly undercooked on the sandwich and had to eat around it. For the prices not worth it.
I'd suggest going somewhere else
