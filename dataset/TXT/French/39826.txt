K2C8dSx9215LLcIzHL959Q This is by far my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. It exceeds all attempts at fine dining on this side of Pennsylvnia. The other highlight is that the quality and execution of the food is a bargain compared to equivalent restaurants that I've visited in more expensive cities (such as NYC or Los Angeles). 

Chef Anthony Garbarino's creativity is reflected in his glasware, decor, and colorful dishes (see photos). With his dessert menu, he truly invites diners to play with their food. 

I'm a huge fan of the duck served here. The mustard emulsion and crispy Brussels sprouts really support the robust flavors from the duck. I've tried most things off the menu at this point, so I'm curious to taste other offerings from Chef Anthony. 

This is my first pick for a special or intimate dinner. The Frenchman has recently moved and I'm sure I'll be paying a visit to their new location soon.
