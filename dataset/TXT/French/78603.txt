ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug I like eating in Paris when I visit vegas.  I love the aesthetic of the place, I feel like it smells better here than in some other places, I don't know what it is, I just enjoy it in Paris.  So we were wandering around the casino and shops in the evening, and decided to grab a bite here on our way out.  We sat on the terrace, which is a nice spot to people watch, though it was a bit louder than I was hoping for at dinner time.  I can forgive that, after all, it's a casino in vegas, what did I expect?  I cannot, however, forgive the food I was served.  Myself and my partner both ordered steak frites.  What we were served was not appetizing at all.  The steak was grey, and about 20% of the steak was gristle.  The remainder of the steak was drowning in oil, not drizzled with, not garnished with, it was sitting in a puddle of oil on a plate.  It was disgusting.  I took a few bites of it, and the flavor was not any better than the presentation; bland, uninspired, worse than a steak at IHOP.  My partner sent hers back, and we were not charged for it, which was good,  but even that doesn't make up for how awful the food was in the first place.  Avoid this place!  If you want steak frites, go to Mon Ami Gabi, across the gaming floor, pay a couple bucks extra, and get a good meal.
