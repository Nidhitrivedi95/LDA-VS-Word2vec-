vna49NPM-7B11tcFPTgnsg If I owned a restaurant, it would be something very similar to Le Comptoir. I wanted to try this spot for a year before I finally got to and it didn't disappoint at all.

The food was served in the most ideal portion sizes so that I could get several dishes to try, but still have enough to get my fill of it and actually end up full without feeling ripped. The prices for the dishes range from 10 to 20 bucks and none of them disappointed. Every dish was interesting to say the very least and were all tasty. We tried A LOT... almost the whole menu (party of 2 only) including a repeat of the Pan Fried Cod. The Cod was the best dish of the evening. The flavors were subtle, but there was still a lot going on. It was quite a revelation in multiple ways. I always thought Cod was whack until I had it here. Always too flaky, dry, and overcooked, but not here. The clams were also really great too as I never really cared for them either before this dish. The Potato Mousseline with that Smoked Paprika oil was awesome too and the whole thing just came together beautifully. It's not heavy at all so you can go ahead and enjoy other stuff. 

Basically you really can't go wrong here with what you order. You can ask the servers or the cooks for recommendations as well since the cooks cook right in front of the bar which I think is awesome. They're really cool and down to earth, as are the servers/hosts.

The decor and overall ambiance of the place is what drew me here in the first place. It's so casual and classy without the pretentiousness and the ridiculous prices. I would so come here after work to have a glass of wine to go with some delectable food. Too bad I live in Los Angeles though...
