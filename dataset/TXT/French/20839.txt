AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw I don't really know where to start. If I had to chose between steady 2000 calorie an hour, mattress scorching sex and an occasional Francios Payard dessert, I think I would have to chose dessert. 

it is a prix Fixe menu. You can chose 3 courses for $45. We chose 6. 
First up was the Olive Savory Macaron with Gorgonzola Ice Cream.  Olive as a dessert? Who knew? Well, we should of, because I can't believe I wasted 35 years of my life not eating this.  We also chose the Poached Pear with pomegranate and Szechaun Pepper Ice Cream. I never thought I'd find an ice cream that i prefered to Ben&Jerry's Creme Brulee. If only I could pick this stuff up in a pint at my local WAWA.  
From the Coffee, Caramel and Nuts menu we chose the Peanut Butter Napoleon, with milk chocolate and rice krispies. Now you are so speaking my language.  Gorgeous presentation, delicious. Hated sharing it.  We also chose the Coffee Eclair, which looked amazing, but I did not get to taste. I was too slow. 

From the Orchard, we went with Apple Three Ways. I just liked name. It was the only thing that did not stand out flavorwise, but it was still very good. It was a Cardamon Strussel, Granny Smith sorbet and apple chips. Delicous, but overshadowed by everything else on the table.  

Last but not least, was the Devil's Food Cake, with Chocolate pudding and whipped Creme Fraiche. Absolutely fantastic. I am ruined for anything else now.
