This place is trying to be pretentious and their prices reflect it. The service was horrible and most 'pretentious' places I go to in Yorkville or around the world have the best service ever to justify their pricing.

Our waitress dismissed my friend and I as 2 little kids (we are in our 30's by the way) who were trying wine for the first time because we thought it was cool. When we asked for a suggestion, she had no idea about some of the wines we were talking about and recommended a wine she thought was full body and low acidity. It was very acidic and we actually left more then half the bottle. The food was ok, some better then others. The cheese was absolutely tasteless. Very Disappointed.

I will not be going back. If you want to overcharge then make sure your servers are worth it. Train them in how not to judge people and to know their wines.
