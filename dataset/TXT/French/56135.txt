rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Staying at the Venetian we decided to try breakfast here before making the drive home... I was a little concerned about bringing in the stroller, but our little man did great the whole time. We did notice a few other kids who didn't do so great.

The Salmon Baguette was just what I needed. The perfect amount of fresh salmon, capers, onions and cream cheese with a baguette that is toasted just enough. I'll be eating this again!

My fiance got the American breakfast.. It was better than Denny's, but nothing to amazing.

Service was fine. Overall atmosphere was a nice contrast from the upbeat 'morning' music in the Venetian elevators. 
I want to eat Dinner here next time I'm at the Venetian!
