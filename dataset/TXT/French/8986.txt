4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Went here for the first time and was very happy with my experience. Servers were great and helpful with the menu and drinks. Quick and friendly service and the food was delicious. The atmosphere was great and we had great seating outside looking at the Bellagio fountains from our table. The pricing was reasonable and wasn't too expensive as other restaurants are in Vegas. Good food, good service, nice strip view outdoor seating. Can't complain.
