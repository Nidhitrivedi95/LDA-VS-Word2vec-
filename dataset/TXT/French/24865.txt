COgwFthJpS4We16W5Gf4lw Terrific French restaurant downtown. We ate here for thanksgiving and had the pre fixe menu. Three of our party had turkey and one (me) lamb chops.

Good:
Lamb chops were exceptional.  Incredible mint sauce was the best I've ever had!
All the sides were top notch
The pumpkin soufflé was ridiculously good. Would've licked the bowl clean if it was less public a table

Bad:
Place straddles the line between old school charm and old and outdated - and mostly loses
Horrible location. Convenient, but not a place you feel comfortable doing things like getting in and out of your car.  In a low income area
Servers a bit too unfriendly for my taste and seemed to not be very sharp. May have been due to the holiday menu, I'll assume.

Otherwise I'd definitely recommend on the food alone and being something different
