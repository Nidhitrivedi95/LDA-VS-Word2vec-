QeFsIMcIFIJcOrpthYL8jg Was searching for a fresh cuisine in the old town and ended up here. Overall I would say it's a great value, not as expensive as the other French restaurants nearby, but the atmosphere was close to the other Toronto bars. We had the lamb rack and duck confit. I think the lamb rack tastes good, but not worth $40 bucks. In constant the duck confit was much better value. The cucumber conic was fresh and light, perfect summer drink. If planning to come here I would recommend make a reservation for seat after 7:30 upstairs for the live music..it's what really distinguish it from other bars. Maybe not the most classic French cuisine but the food was tasty regardless.
