m9aFZk1f8tSv248YErbpQA Extremely slow service but everything else was fantastic! I got the reinette crepe which was a buckwheat crepe filled with apples, goat cheese, walnuts, and a honey drizzle. I loved the blend of sweet and savory, delicious! The side salad was tasty as well, good dressing. I can't remember the name of the dish my BF ordered, but there was an egg and bacon and bread so he was happy haha. We also needed to try a dessert crepe, there were so many incredible options. We decided on the Snow White which was white chocolate and raspberry sauce, a delicious combination of flavors!! Prices were as expected, a little high but very much worth it. 
Our server was nice but I was a little surprised by how slow moving everything was. Like they greeted us but didn't tell us to seat ourselves or wait to be seated so we weren't sure. Then they took quite a while to get us water. I understand they were busy but the wait was like abnormally long like I don't think there are very many times I've ever waited that long to order and then get my food. Was worth it though and I'd gladly come back!
