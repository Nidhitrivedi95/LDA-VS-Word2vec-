4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I had their trout dinner and it was fantastic! Their Frangria (their version of Sangria) is made with rosemary and wasn't to my liking (tasted like pine tree). Their sea scallops were great too! I think it is a little bit on the expensive side for the amount of food that you get, but then again it is in a major casino on the strip. Mon Ami Gabi is a great place, but it doesn't top my go-to restaurant, Maggiano's, which is just down the strip at the Fashion Show Mall.
