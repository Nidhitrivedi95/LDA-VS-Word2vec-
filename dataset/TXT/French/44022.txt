MdjIl105vqCYUGKFSUVytA Absolutely one of the best restaurants in the city which actually has some class. I have eaten around the world and staff were very courteous and welcoming. I had the salad bar for brunch with a friend and we loved it all. Great job on everything - and the macarons are PERFECT!!!!
