rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A BEST. RESTAURANT. EVER.

From the service to the food... everything deserves an A+++.

I ordered the steak and it was melt in your mouth delicious. Perfect amount of salt and that garlic butter on top was the best. The fries that came with my steak were addicting and I couldn't stop picking at it.

I will be back here every time I visit Vegas!!
