ysJo5Jdo29XOBCnKrbUKWg We did breakfast/brunch on Sunday and there was little that wasn't dead on. We have a quiche, two benedicts (one salmon, one spinach), the brunch plate, an omelette, a few croissants on the side, five (great) cafe au laits, and one bloody Mary. The food is exceptional and the service great. The atmosphere and deign of the cafe is inviting and peaceful. Initially, my qualms might have been with the total - $120 - but on reflection is aligns with what we had and the quality of service. A lovely place.
