ZdaZwXC0FByDY3EwNELphw Union is a nice, small and cozy restaurant that I would recommend. The food was good but nothing amazing. The two items that stood out compared to the others were the Elk Sliders and the Sticky Ribs. 

Elk Sliders - 4/5 (Very flavorful and juicy)
Union Salad - 3.5/5 (Pretty plain in my opinion. Was not impressed)
Steak Tartare - 4/5 (Good but nothing amazing)
Sticky Ribs - 4/5 (Very tender and flavorful)
Side fries - 4/5 (Reminded me of my childhood when my parents brought me to McDonalds. I might have had more than a couple glasses of wine by this time)

Overall, definitely a good place for a night out!
