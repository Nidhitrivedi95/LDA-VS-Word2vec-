XKPosZx2j4RHcZ8Ewdwj0A Dear, dear Leméac, oh how you did not live up to the expectations I had for you.  Never having been when I lived in the city, I figured it would be worthwhile to give Leméac a try so I went with two friends (who have gone several times before) on a late Thursday evening to try their after 10pm special ($27 for an appetizer and entree and tea/coffee at the end).

Place was bustling and busy. We were all hungry so we took a quick look at the menu and ordered a few drinks.  

The appetizers were great:
- Pankoe crusted goat cheese with apple and walnut salad - had a bite of my friend's dish and it was good, very rich tasting.
- Grilled calamari with zucchini - you get lots of calamari. My friend couldn't eat hers which meant more for me to try!
- Escargots in a basil butter sauce - the escargot sauce was green and frothy. Very cool. 

The mains were a different story:
- I was not very impressed with my main (duck leg confit with salad and roasted potato fingerlings). The duck was dry, slightly shriveled and same thing with the potatoes. 
- Sea salt salmon pot au feu - AMAZING. Definitely order this if your going to go.
- Toulouse sausage with a salad and side of mustard - the mustard was TANGY. Wow, consider yourself warned.  However, we were more impressed with the knife that they give you with the sausage meal (don't ask - it's a long story).

Another issue we had was with our waiter, who was dreadful to put it nicely. He even managed to put down their coffee supplier (Moi Toi Café) when we were asked about tea/coffee at the end of the night. He was also incredible slow at getting our bill/then getting the machine, etc. I don't usually complain about service but you would expect better service, especially here.

With so many good restaurants in the city, especially french, I can't really recommend going after my first time trying it.
