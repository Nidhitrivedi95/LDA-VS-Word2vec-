Yp1swb-8pO8i-6-jaK2tsA Went there with my friend. She had salmon which was delicious, but the garlic spinach it came with was luke warm at best and had no garlic taste whatsoever. I ordered a chicken breast salad with a side of fries. The waiter never wrote down that I ordered fries. The service was super slow at 2pm with hardly anybody in the place. Food tasted good, but the service won't have us coming back. Lots of other choices in the area. The only thing our waiter was quick with was the check.
