_eNeiqWPt1MPLFF6DEIJeA We went here last Friday night to use a groupon we had for two steam buns and two drinks. It was pretty empty when we went around 7 except for the bar. I ordered the kung pao chicken steam buns, my boyfriend ordered the crab cake steam buns, and I also ordered the pork and greens steam buns. The kung pao chicken were meh tasting more like burnt spice and had a metallic aftertaste. The pork and greens were good and my boyfriend seemed to like his crab cake buns. I ordered a ginger margarita which tasted only like sour mix and my boyfriend ordered a blackberry old fashioned which he liked. The service however was horrible. There was only one waitress who told us constantly that she was new and seemed completely confused on how to do her job. The bartender ended up helping her with our order and the house manager was floating around and seemed stressed and not sure where to help at. It took forever for us to get our food and even longer to get someones attention to get our check. Probably won't be coming back here.
