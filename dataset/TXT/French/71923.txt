XI3iNUgChOfJk5ppjKVEQQ How good is too good? That's the question you'll be asking yourself after eating here. The wait list is no joke, but sign-up early, it's worth it! The knowledgeable, attractive and friendly wait staff is always helpful and kind. Drink the wine, you won't be disappointed. If you're hungry enough, order everything, do not leave without having the octopus appetizer!! The desserts are insanely portioned, usually on the too big side, and too good. Start to finish it was perfect. Be ready to spend some cash, but it won't matter how much when you stumble out satiated, your smile will be worth any price
