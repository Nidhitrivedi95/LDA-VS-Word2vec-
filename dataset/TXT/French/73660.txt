xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g I've had special team business dinners here the past two years at our conference. Both times the service was amazing, and the food is to die for. Plus, this restaurant really does have one of the best views on the strip.  It is expensive, of course, but if you are going to splurge on somewhere expensive, choose here!
