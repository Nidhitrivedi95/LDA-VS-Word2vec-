hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA this is my first review ever on yelp and I chose this place to be the first. Why? Because this place is like that!!!  Their chicken curry sandwich (not on the menu) is a life changer. How do I know? I just ate one and inspired me to write this review. Awesome customer service. The owner is very friendly and welcoming.  Like other reviews mention the place is not the easiest place to find, but consider it a hidden treasure because it is. Go there. NOW.
