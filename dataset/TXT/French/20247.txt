atNpoWy_XrhT9EUIEP6azg Went there for lunch today and had the absolute best oysters I have ever had. Half dozen from the east coast delish! I also had the tuna tartine which was great also I had to push aside the olive side but I am just not an olive fan. 

My boyfriend got a chicken dish ,poulet something and gobbled it up! We both ended up fighting over the grilled corn with creme it was so so good! The service also 
MAde it very worth while , I asked for sangria which they didn't have however he offered to make me one and it was delish! 

No complaints will definatly come back!
