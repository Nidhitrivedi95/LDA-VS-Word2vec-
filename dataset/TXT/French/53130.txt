QeFsIMcIFIJcOrpthYL8jg Went there during 'happening gourmand'. 

Food was good 8/10.

I mostly wanted to write a review for their service. It was really great 10/10. Our waitress was very nice and social and went beyond what was expected from her. A couple beside asked her to take a pic of them, not only did she take a pic she even said there's a spot in the restaurant with a nice background, let's go take a pic there. 

2 desserts were included in the menu for the event, 3rd had a surcharge. Me and my bf both chose the same one. She came back saying bad news i only have 1 left so i brought you all 3 on the house. 

Ambiance: 10/10 really nice place
