SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA I've now been here a few times, and enjoyed it each time.  A nice bistro menu, with some creative items.  The food has been delicious each time, and the service has been great.  Coming to Cleveland from NYC, I'm particularly tuned in to what a good restaurant can be, and this place is lovely.
