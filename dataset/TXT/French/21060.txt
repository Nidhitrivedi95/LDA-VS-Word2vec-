B_0VW7Pw26YiQyDRuutIGQ We wanted to like this place, so badly. But two stars is all we could give. We arrived for dinner around 7pm and were seated promptly without reservations. There was only one other party dining at the time. Perhaps that should have been our cue to turn around and leave. We ordered our drinks quickly, along with a children's meal.  The waitress was extremely nice and did her best info coaxing us into ordering certain appetizers, stressing that lots of the items were home made. The children's entree (pizza) came out rather quickly, thank goodness. Then the drinks (4) took forever. From what we could tell, it was a one woman show -- same lady was taking orders and making drinks. The appetizer, which was the cheese plate, came out a long while later (approx 30 min) and was utterly disappointing. For almost $30, you got four sliver of cheeses with old, toasted bread - totally not worth it. Then the painful part came - waiting for our entrees. When we told the waitress we were through with our appetizer and for her not to delay the entrees because there was still cheese left, she informed us that the other table hadn't received their entrees yet and that we were next in line. After about 2 long hours of waiting, we finally got our entrees. Food was mediocre at best. It was such a painful dining experience. Don't get me wrong, the staff was friendly and it seemed like they were genuinely trying, but it was painful and looooong. They really need to get their stuff together with all of the other great options closeby otherwise I don't see them staying open for long.
