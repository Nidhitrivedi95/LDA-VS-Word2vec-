Tefx_N6A6nrsdj4jHHnbYg An wonderful surprise discovery. By far, one of the best cups of coffee we've had in the valley. Service was superb, and the croissants divine. Their signature lavender cake was a sensory experience, unfolding in layers of flavor, while  the salted caramel cookie was perfectly balanced. We had a lovely conversation with both the owner and chef, who were wonderfully engaging and helpful. Looking forward to our next visit.
