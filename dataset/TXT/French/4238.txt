2gUbgbdJ7IFSbicBXlSchw I was in Montreal for work, and my mom visited me and asked if we can go somewhere with authentic French Food. This was a recommendation from a co-worker and it was SO good!

The small place on St. Denis immediately gave you a Parisien feel. The food wasn't too expensive, and good portions for the meal. People were friendly and we felt very comfortable, even with a small child running around. 

I liked it alot and would definately come back here. I really felt I had good value for money, which is important to me. Quality and Quantity of food.
