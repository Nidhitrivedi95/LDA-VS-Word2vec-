VwZhwflLnTq19aAeFLJHCQ Amazing neighborhood spot! My husband and I ate here for dinner last night. We shared the escargot, he had the ribeye, I had the salmon. True to all reviewers, the pesto mashed potatoes were really good. 

I wasn't sure about the wine list, so after calling to ask a few questions, we decided to bring a bottle (corkage is $20).

The service staff was amazingly friendly and helpful; it really seemed like a team environment amongst them!

The live music was a bonus!

We'll surely be back! Thanks, Lynn, for ensuring we had a great date last night!
