Dcj69NZJnbJhK-YHP_nULA While in town, this was another must that my cousin raved about. So I was pretty excited to try it. From what I had heard, Brasserie V had an outstanding list of beers, and amazing food.

We walked in and it had an old victorian, dark & cool kinda feel to it. We got seated right away, in the back right by the kitchen. Our waiter was fantastic, and patient with us as we took a little bit on what we wanted to drink since there were pages upon pages of all different beer from around the world to choose from. 

I honestly can not remember what beer I had gotten unfortunately, all I know is that it was an IPA since it was National IPA Day! For my dinner I ended up getting an Apple Swiss, with mixed greens as a side, we also got the truffle frites which was great, my only complaint with the Apple Swiss sandwich was that the baguette was extremely hard, I thought my teeth were going to rip out from trying to bite down on it so hard. 

Truly other than the hard baguette, my experience here was great! I can't wait to go again!
