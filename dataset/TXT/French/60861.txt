SD7vTf-H00J8BS3L-kt7jg Nice atmosphere but extremely terrible service. We were sitting at the bar and there wasn't a lot of room to put our bags so we used the empty seat next to us. The waiter came and told us we couldn't use that chair because someone would be sitting there. I told him that I would obviously move it when someone showed up. The waiter did not look happy. No one showed up until we were about to leave. As for the rest of the night, we had to ask for everything, water, drinks, utensils, the bill, EVERYTHING. The waitress showed up a total of 2 times. To take our order and for the bill at the end. My steak was overcooked but no one bothered to check in and ask how we were doing. Overall a terrible experience, not worth the money.
