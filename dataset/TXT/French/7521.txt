I wish I could remember our waiters name but he was delightfully extra and friendly. His service might be the best I have ever experienced. He brought me a complimentary glass of champagne as soon as he knew it was my birthday! Way to my heart, lol. 

We both got their famous steak frites. A nice piece of steak, cooked to perfection and served with shoestring potatoes which are fried. I thought it was amazing but Karl felt it was a bit salty. We got a side of Mac and cheese too because that is my food of choice and it was delicious. 

I highly, highly recommend this place. It's atmosphere and food are outstanding for the more than affordable price point. They have a patio available as well which is right on the strip and perfect for people watching but the inside is so lovely I really recommend it for a more romantic dining experience. I would definitely come back here if I didn't have eight thousand other places in vegas I need to eat at.
