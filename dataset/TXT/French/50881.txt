oZHbPhIj01_31jqD053a_Q Wow wow wow! Lovely experience of high dining in Montreal. The service is exceptional and the food is just incredible, delicious, creative. Went for dinner during their 15th anniversary special (April 2017). It's a pricey restaurant so this promo was great as it allowed us to have a six course tasting menu at a reasonable price. 

My favourite was the lobster bisque cappuccino! But everything really was delicious!
