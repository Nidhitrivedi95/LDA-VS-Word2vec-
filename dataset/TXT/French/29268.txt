eUjDWzbQ6eLZy0uELEOa9Q Food - great selection and tasty.  VERY well worth the $19.99 ... I actually have no idea what you other cheap-asses are bitching about ... I'd pay $30 for this brunch.

Hostess - an absolute condescending tart ... get a grip boiler house people ... this is the first impression to your supposedly awesome restaurant.  From the reviews on here, the service was my only concern - and it was shi!t right from walking in.  

Waiter - he was actually excellent ... mind you I caught the drift he was giving me the eye of the tiger.
