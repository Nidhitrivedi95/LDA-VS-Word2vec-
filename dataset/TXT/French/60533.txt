SBnpT6JDbah-5l_52GM5sw Thank you Sardine for being our restaurant of choice for the last 4 years of my son's matriculation at the U of Wisconsin-Madison. The food and service are amazing and we've had an opportunity to share many important conversations over Moule Frite, a bottle or 2 of wine and some wonderful French Bread dipped in the flavorful liquid. Alas, he is moving on, but we will find a reason to come from the Twin Cities for an excellent experience. Unless of course you can find a way to relocate... :)
