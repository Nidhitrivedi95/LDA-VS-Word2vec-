O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q Let's put it this way: we like this place so much we ate here twice during our last trip. With all the restaurants to choose from in town, that should say something!

We've eaten breakfast, brunch, lunch and dinner here on various trips and have never had a bad meal. The waitstaff is also excellent. Attentive, accurate and if you get Tito or Sal, funny as well!

Some general notes:
Breakfast - skip the Bloody Mary cart unless you have a special request. The bartender can crank one out that is just as good in half the time. This last trip I tried the Turkey Hash - diced turkey, potatoes, sliced jalapenos, grilled brussels sprouts topped with a sunny side up egg, served in a sizzling hot cast iron pan. To die for! The wife's fruit plate had excellent selections of perfectly ripe fruit and melon. The omelets are huge and stuffed with all sorts of goodness.

Lunch - Good burgers, good steaks, great service.

Dinner - If you get the chance, try the Tasting Menu when it's offered. The steak tartare is quite possibly the best I've ever had. The steaks are great, the short rib transcendent. You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu.

We were bummed when Society Cafe closed next door at Encore, but Morel's more than makes up for that loss. Excellent bar and good wine selection as well.
