rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Came on a Thursday night - no reservation, seated immediately. Nice ambiance (if you're seated outside, you overlook the private pool).

Bread & butter - so yum.
Appetizers: Oysters & an special (which I can't remember b/c my hubby ordered it and I didn't have much - I do remember that it was good). We had 1/2 dozen oysters & they give you 2 of 3 different types, so you get a little oyster-ed & it comes with either tabasco (typical), cocktail sauce (eh) or a mignonette (perfect), and lemon wedges of course. (I got all three just in case I didn't like their mignonette, b/c some recipes are just too vinegar-y or onion-y for me.)
Main course: My husband had the braised short ribs...loved it. I had something they had as a special - scallops...also loved it.
Dessert: Creme brulee...the complete star of the evening. We went to Paris for our honeymoon, and I don't think we had creme brulee even as good as this.
We had a carafe of the Roussan which I know you can get outside of the restaurant, but as an aside - I enjoyed it. It's the way I like my white wines to taste.

Overall a good experience, although I agree with someone else who reviewed the restaurant that the food was a little salty...but still really good. I'd definitely go back - maybe for breakfast or lunch next time.
