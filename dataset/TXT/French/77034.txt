yU3p0tEBtGuZLTcsBHw9uQ Anyone who knows me, knows that I love brunch and I love it even more when the presentation of it is beautiful. I creeped Le Passe Compose really hard before coming and was SO excited to come. Zero disappointment -hands down one of the best brunch spots I have ever been to in my life. I find that a lot of brunch places are overpriced for what they serve. While they serve some standard items here, they also serve some more interesting plates such as the duck confit poached egg I had. It was served with butternut squash, Parmesan, chives, white Porto sauce, and potato waffles. The butternut squash with the egg and duck created such a great explosion of flavours. Also, I'm not a big sauce person but that white porto sauce was A-mazing and I just wish I could bottle it up and bring home a gallon!

I also tried their croque madame (rustic bread, white ham, d'Auvergne cheese, Bechamel sauce, old cheddar, poached egg, arugula and endive salad caramelized with sherry). While I am no connoisseur of croque madames I just know that this was a huge potion of DELICIOUS things coming together. The bread was amazing as an added bonus and the pictures speak for themselves because the plating was just beautiful. I wish that this place would exist in Toronto because I would come ALL the time. OBSESSED.
