Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA I hated it. I was part of a large (16 person) group that was being served from a pre-arranged menu. We sat down at 7:30 and had to rush the servers to get out of there at 11:15. The food was small (miniscule), of decent quality, and vastly overpriced. The service was horrid and the food - well, the food was very, very small. We started with an appetizer that could have been hidden under a nickel. After a 6 course meal I went out for dinner...

Incredibly, the food was really mediocre. One of the key signs for me is the bread a restaurant serves. Heaven is when the bread comes to the table fresh from the oven. The bread here was old and cold. The tuna tartar was passable when eaten with the mango salsa. The rest was more of the same - small, mediocre and over-priced. 

I felt like I was in the Emperor's new clothes story - everyone raving about nothing!

Don't go here to eat unless you're just dying to throw away your money and walk away hungry.
