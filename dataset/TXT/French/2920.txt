0Xr0kte9ADAfZ-GBO-wimg I ate here in the summer because the man standing outside had enticed us to stop by as we were walking past.  We sat on the patio and the only thing I remember about my mediocre and  unmemorable meal was that it was overpriced.  The service was decent if not a little slow.  Not the worst dining experience ever but I feel it explains why they have someone standing outside to lure customers in.
