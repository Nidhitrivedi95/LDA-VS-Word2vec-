rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Service is spectacular. 

Came here for breakfast and a midnight snack. 

The sourdough waffles have a wonderful texture and are nicely made, however I don't feed there is a need to add syrup since the strawberry toppings are already sweet. 

I wouldn't recommend the baguette w/ cream cheese, since I found it a bit too hard. 

Frites are wonderful. I could finish a whole pound of fries myself...

Definitely come with a full wallet & empty stomach :P
