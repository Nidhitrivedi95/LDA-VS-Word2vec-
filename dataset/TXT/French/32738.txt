h_ypoQ2rmwX8UGSmohsGiQ Went to brunch with my partner on Saturday July 16th. The place has a nice bistro vibe. Although the sign at the entrance says "wait to be seated" no one really seated us. We were asked to sit either inside or in the patio - there was no welcome or greeting - just a mere glance. We opted to sit in the patio. The place was barely occupied except for three tables. There were two servers on the floor. 

I ordered chicken club with hard-boiled egg, avocado, red cabbage, tomatoes "à la Provençale", bacon & spicy mayo and my partner ordered peal bacon sandwich with caramelized onions & sunny side-up egg on brioche bread. The server we had very limited knowledge of the menu. Chicken club was average - the chicken lacked any flavor. There was no Provençale taste in this dish. The accompanying salad was poorly dressed and had thick layers of unmixed salad dressing. Peal bacon sandwich was okay but nothing special. 

Although it wasn't a busy time,  the service we received was poor and spotty. My latte was served without a spoon or sugar and had to ask twice for sugar and a spoon. We got two water glasses - one with a lemon slice and one without. I wondered if the server at least checked what she is serving because I didn't ask without lemon. Our meals were served without any cutlery. I also order a piece of pistachio cake from the bakery counter.  The server was not at all interested in describing the cake - rather she pointed at the label on the display case. The cake was moist and the icing was just fine; however,  the cake crust was slightly burnt. I can accept this level of customer service if there was a long line of customers at the bakery counter - but there was no one waiting for service besides me. 

So overall the service was rather poor. Maman is located in a food court in the financial district but I expected better service and products given that their prices are higher than normal food court prices.
