teTQU7TIPE0O_B1zN_239w Worst experience I ever had at Mimis. Had the corn beef hash and eggs. The hash was all dried out with no flavor what so ever. Eggs were burnt around the edges. Waitress was a older woman but was slow as hell and never came back to the table to ask how everything was. It was very slow at the time so don't feel there was any excuse for the poor food and service.
