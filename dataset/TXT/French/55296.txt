rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A My 2nd Bouchon visit. First was in Yountville, back when Keller was still cooking!

Came for a light bite dinner, but even ordering off the starter and salad portion of the menu, couldn't finish the food, and felt badly.. since it was all so yummy.

Well prepared... romantic inside, but music was inappropriate and just way too loud. Ordered some light white wine.

The dinner was just perfect...

Pan epis comes to your table without plates, so don't bother asking, as I did. So fresh and crunchy.

We started with the special chilled cantaloupe melon soup. Nice balance.. sweet, salty, creamy... yum.

We also got the starter dish of clams with sofrito. Can get salty without any kind of bread to dip and balance it out. 

Then we also splurged for the cold salmon rillettes (remember.. the week we were there, it averaged 117F!!!)... also wonderfullly rich, tasty, and slathered all over fresh crostini. 

What we just couldn't finish was a wonderful watercress and endive salad ($11) that had chunks of Roquefort cheese and this great walnut vinaigrette and large toasted half walnuts. Perfect  and light. Full of flavor and service was not pushy.

We dined in a relaxed space before heading out to the hot Strip to enjoy the night shows on the Boulevard. 

I heard brunch is also otherworldly.

PS when arriving from Palazzo, 10th floor, Veneta bridge to get there! Restroom is outside the restaurant. Turn right when exiting; they will be on your left.
