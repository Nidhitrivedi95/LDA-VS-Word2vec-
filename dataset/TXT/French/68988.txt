VwZhwflLnTq19aAeFLJHCQ My husband and I tried this restaurant about 4 days after it opened. In spite of a couple of minor hiccups which I attribute to newness I am giving this restaurant 5 stars. The food was delicious, the service very good, and the menu was inventive. 

Our waiter seemed new to the profession but was friendly and helpful. Other staff though seemed to be very experienced. I am fairly certain that will all even itself out. The décor was a little frenetic between it's ode to music, movies, France, and a little Titanic but I understand they did themed dinners at the restaurant at Lake Las Vegas so they may have something similar planned for this location.

We started with the escargot which came in a traditional garlic butter with an addition of tomatoes and bacon. Neither my husband or I had had it that way and it was delicious. My husband got the shrimp salad sandwich which was beautiful and light. I had the salmon in lavender sauce which quite honestly is some of the best salmon I have ever had. It was very savory and the pesto mashed potatoes were a perfect compliment. We finished up with crème brulee which had the added surprise of the custard being caramel. My favorite desert with the addition of my favorite flavor. Yum! 

I am very much hoping that Bernard's will break the curse of this location because I hope to enjoy many meals there and Henderson, if not Las Vegas is sorely in need of restaurants with affordable French cuisine.
