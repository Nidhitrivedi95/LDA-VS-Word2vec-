bmE5Yv3q5TF0wx6SmWgIUg this is just a start to a review, as i didn't really get a chance to really go over the menu and wine list.

we ended up here because we had been at ra next door, stuck on the patio b/c their busy friday happy hour forced us outside. it was soooooooooo hot we packed up and went next door. which was a little off-putting, going from a loud, 80s top 40s-playing young, boisterous crowd to a French, white-table cloth restaurant playing elevator music. we were a lot of sweaty, a little drunk and felt very out of place. 

the decor reminded me of mimi's - fake brick and whimsical fake vines and wrought iron and chandeliers. not my taste, or my style, but i can imagine the moms and grandmas EAT IT UP. in fact i saw more delighted, mouth hanging open, oohing and ahhhing by 50+ women in that 20 minutes it took me to finish my beer than i thought possible.

ok, but i have to give this place credit, after knocking its style- and note that everything is authentic. the brick that looks like it's from Thunder mountain railroad is actually imported from europe. the woode framed doors, windows are actual pieces salvaged from old world churches. the chandeliers, same deal.... i'm sure the owner paid a pretty penny for such authenticity, but unless you are told that, you wouldn't know, so... it's kind of a loss, i think.

the menu looked delicious, lots of cheeses and brie and escargo - french fancy stuff. i would like to come back and try the food, and probably will. and maybe my rating will go up then.
