It's kind of rare to go to a supposedly elite Las Vegas eatery and leave dissatisfied as long as you did your homework.  I guess maybe Halloween threw them off!  L'Atelier was supposed to be one of the flagship Joel Robuchon offerings.  We were looking forward to really exploring some innovative French cuisine.  While, it certainly was innovative, the finished products left something to be desired.  The service was good.  Friendly and attentive. The ambiance was warm and trendy.  Service and environment were not the problem.  The food was. 

We opted for the Menu B, a more extensive prix fixe offering with two appetizers and two entrees plus dessert.  My wife and I started with the poached egg over smoked salmon.  This was truly delicious and built up our hopes for the rest of the meal.  Next up, I had the escargot which had a nice taste (suspect it was Pernod) with a molten polenta cake.  It was quite good.  My wife had the veloute of spinach which was rather bland to my taste.  Next, we both got the roasted duck breast with figs.  The duck was cooked well but the flavors around it were muted and the duck itself did not carry the dish alone.  For our second entrees, my wife had the salmon which was hardly unique in preparation nor flavor.  I have the pork which was flavorful, over sauteed cabbage, but slightly over cooked.

For dessert, we both got the carrot cake which was beautifully presented, looking like a carrot stuck in the ground.  It was modest and gone before we knew it.

Overall, we were just underwhelmed.  We have had so much better when it comes to elite French dining experiences.  For sake of context, we loved Sage in Aria much better than this.
