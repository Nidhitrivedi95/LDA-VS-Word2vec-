6fPQJq4f_yiq1NHn0fd11Q I came here with my friends to grab a late breakfast/lunch.  I ate here maybe five years ago, and I remembered it was pretty good.  You place your order at the window, and you can go grab a table while you wait for your crepe to be made.  It usually takes about five minutes or so, depending on how busy they are.

I went with the Fruits de Mer( http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/z1163PZ9voGYg4HawDXrkw/l ) which had shrimp, scallops, mushrooms, Swiss cheese and Bechamel sauce.  It tasted like the seafood was frozen, and the Bechamel sauce didn't have much flavor.  I had a bite of my friend's Toulouse, which had a marinara sauce, and that was much tastier.  

I also got a cup of coffee here, and after a while, I noticed my cup was slowly leaking from the bottom.  They were nice enough to give me a fresh cup of coffee, which I then burned my tongue on.  =P

If you come here, go for the dessert crepes or the Toulouse.  I'm not a fan of their Bechamel sauce, but the other stuff is good!
