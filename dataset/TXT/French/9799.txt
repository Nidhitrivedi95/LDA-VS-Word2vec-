I ordered some appetizers (which were great) and the cold seafood platter for two. I was disappointed in the dish. The lobster wasn't the best. Oysters were a major disappointment too. 

May return and try something different, but the other main dishes our friends ordered weren't much to write home about either.

I've heard they have amazing breakfast - would try that.
