H464UiJ5c7q5dAJ14h731A In a party of 4. Two of us had poisson du jour, scallops (yea I know), which were grilled & served on bed of polenta. Excellent. Scallops done to perfection & polenta creamy with slight nutty (hazelnut?) flavour.  We also had red beets & grilled red peppers. both a pleasure to consume.  One minor complaint, the Green salad was tasty with very good dressing but the type of arugula was mostly stem making it a challenge to eat (coming from someone who is not a picky eater).  Our first time to Gus but I don't expect our last, & I'll certainly recommend to friends heading to Montreal.
