Zm49-4emuoqhfb-nOPEYOg I wanted crepes while I was in Montreal and this place happened to be closest. They use a buckwheat batter that, honestly, scared me at first. I layered the Lille des seour which included spinach, avocado, salsa, egg, and probably something else. End game: it was goooood. I'd go back in a heart beat. Great service and friendly staff as well.
