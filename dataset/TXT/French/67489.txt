UxWH8zRYIBgs6Q2oykvRdw We usually love coming to this place and the food is excellent. However, when we came to celebrate my birthday our server ruined the whole experience for us. The server was more than willing to engage in multiple prolonged conversations with surrounding tables; when it came to us, his service suddenly came evidently quite short handed. He barely smiled or sustained any form of conversation with us. He could not be bothered to serve us and throughout the night he consistently failed to meet any of our requests. My father became extremely aggravated and it led to an escalation to the management. The management and the food was the highlight of our night. She attended and resolved the situation in a very professional and cordial manner. She was able to address the concerns immediately.

Thank you Eva.
