37kk0IW6jL7ZlxZF6k2QBg Arriving at only two minutes late for our long awaited online-made 6pm reservation, my mid-week dinner date and I were very surprised to see that only one other lone diner was there and that we were to be sat immediately beside him on the banquette. However, over the minutes that we perused the aperitif card, every seat in the comfortably cozy little restaurant filled right up. Hopeful walk-ins were greeted with a business card and suggestion to make a reservation ahead of time (which I imagine is at about a month out at this point).

After some debate, we decided to leave the fate of our taste buds to the chef by going with the carte blanche. Taking into consideration my date's shellfish allergy, they were thankfully still able to accommodate the smaller, which turned out to be just right. 

We started with a glass each of Lillet Blanc and Lillet Rouge before moving on to a full bottle for dinner. The olives stuffed with spicy peppers although tasty, proved to not be spicy at all. A steady flow of freshly baked bread and butter interluded our five courses, which included, (pardon my loose descriptions), fish tartar with radishes on shrimp cracker, poached salmon with pea shoots in chicken jus, baked pork saucisson, braised lamb cheek, and dessert of fruit and meringue crumble. 

The rustic decor and side street location paired with the friendly service and delicious food of Edulis made it an understated, yet fantastic experience.

My only minor complaint would be that sitting literally next to the coffee grinder made conversation difficult at times and the constant smell of coffee also mildly affected my full appreciation of later dishes. The decision to seat us in the corner might have been understandable if we had arrived late, but as the second table to arrive, it would have been nice to be rewarded with a more central or window seat.
