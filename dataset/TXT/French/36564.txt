You order at the counter and they'll bring your food out to you. I tried the chicken parm (italian deli/restaurant litmus test) and it passed. Definitely a strong showing. A half a sandwich is enough for most folks and a whole one is good if you are trying to take a nap afterwards. It is a bit more expensive than other places around it, but you are paying for quality, this isn't a chain. In fact, it is family owned and you may want to call ahead if you are traveling more than 20 minutes to get here...the first time we went they were closed for a week while they were on vacation.
