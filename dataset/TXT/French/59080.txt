rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w I took my friend to dinner here tonight for her birthday. We chose to do the 10 course Prestige menu. One course was better than the next and it just kept getting better with each plate. From a fresh and light Japanese yellowtail to beautiful vegetable/legume/edible flower combinations to crab with delicious Russian caviar to an impeccable foie gras and the list goes on! We chose to do wine pairing which we were very happy about as the wines were outstanding. This is where you come to dine if you appreciate fresh ingredients and incredible combinations creating dishes that deserve accolades. Their executive chef, Wilfried Bergerhausen, is easily at the same level, if not better, than the iron chefs. His creations are worthy of appreciative palates and foodies that appreciate the finest in exquisite gastronomy. 
The restaurant is beautiful and inviting. The service is impeccable: attentive, friendly, and it is clear that they love being there. 
It is on the expensive side yet well worth it for those that love the best in elite food. I will say that when speaking of the best restaurants, this restaurant is way better than a high end restaurant of an 'esteemed' chef at the MGM Grand hotel. It is more affordable and the food is way better and deserving of its awards. 
This is a restaurant that is ideal for special occasions and just for amazing food! Highly recommended and I will definitely be returning. In my opinion, this is the best restaurant in Las Vegas.
