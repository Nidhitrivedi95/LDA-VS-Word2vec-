4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Got to sit outside, directly across the street from the Bellagio. This location is perfect for people watching. 

The wait staff were absolutely perfect. A a somewhat picky patron, and former waiter myself, these folks were perfect. They were always around when I wanted something, and never hovering when I didn't. No one did that thing where they bring you your food, and two seconds later, ask how is everything before you've even taken a bite.

I had the french onion soup, the frise/kale/bacon salad, and a burger with blue cheese, bacon, and fried egg. All were awesome. I'd order all again.

I highly recommend this place. Including two glasses of wine, the whole bill was $64.11 for two people. Technically, that makes it fall into the $$$ category, but it's on the low end of it.
