6fPQJq4f_yiq1NHn0fd11Q the section connecting paris and bally's is always really awesome looking [though the miniature/ scaled down reproductions of the villages almost makes me feel like an oompaloompa is going to jump out somewhere...] but this little kiosk happens to have some delicious offerings.

i generally would have opted for a sweet crepe, but since i hadn't had lunch yet, i decided to go with the toulouse crepe [italian sausage, mushrooms, cheese, marinara, etc.] and it was fabulous.  boyfriend felt like the crepe shell was too 'eggy' but i liked mine.  it was priced a little bit above the average, but hey, what's not overpriced in vegas??!!
