rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A This was the best quiche I've ever had. Hands down the best brunch in Vegas. Can't go wrong with the strawberry fields breakfast cocktail. Really every part of my meal here was wonderful even if they were out of my favorite french beer they offered me a great alternative. This is a must visit if you are on the strip. Only part, I wish they they would impose a little bit of a dress policy to keep out the margaritaville riffraff. Merci beaucoup to Bouchon Bistro.
