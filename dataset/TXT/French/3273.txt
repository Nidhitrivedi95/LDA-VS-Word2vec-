Simple enough, but on the Sunday afternoon that I found myself here, I found it took far longer than I expected to just order.  All the tables were filled and there were a fair number coming in for takeout as well. I ordered the smoked salmon crepe, which came with a salad and it was just okay. Pretty expensive for a not-so-generous portion of salmon that wasn't very flavorful even with the creme fraiche. Service was really friendly and the atmosphere was calm as the place began to clear out a bit. My friend had a sweet crepe, which he enjoyed quite a bit so maybe I need to come back and give this place another try. 

They take credit cards now!
