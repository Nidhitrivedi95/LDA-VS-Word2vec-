Wild boar, venison, and cheval.  My favorite was wild boar. Cheval was perfectly tender. My colleague also ordered the escargot. Delicious. I also loved walking to and from the restaurant. Queen street was amazing. Somehow it reminded me of the 1990s south Philly, but clearly more hip, and has a lot of great restaurants along the way. We got lucky, the evening was warm and many were sitting outside as the rain came down. Also reminded me of summer in Paris. I am now a bit of a Toronto fan, having just spent 6 days there for work and for play. I would go back in a heart beat and I will definitely be going back. And I will have to go back to the same restaurant. How come they don't serve cheval in San Francisco? What about wild boar? I already miss it.
