cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg I couldn't leave Montreal without coming here, I wouldn't forgive myself. I was a broke student so I decided to come here with friend and order one main dish, one appetizer. Then the price wouldn't be so bad.

Ok let's see.... I really wanted the foie gras poutine but the waiter came over to tell me Pain De Veau was the daily special! Damn it I can't afford two mains!! Well whatever I guess I'll just have to return.

Pain de veau is a French dish and it's basically veal bread. Something I never heard of! At Au Pied de Cochon they made this with red wine, a lot of veal, some roquette leaves on top, AND FOIE GRAS. Of course FG. I'm not missing out.

It's VERY flavourful, in fact really strong. It's extremely good! 

For the appetizer we ordered duck carpaccio $14, which is raw duck, mushrooms, cheese, egg yolk, dots of colours (sauces). And you mix all this together. It tasted more sour than duck which, to be honest, is usually what westerners do: cover up raw stuff with sour stuff. So you're tasting just the sauce. I would pass if this doesn't interest you. I personally would order something else next time.

I think in total it was just $34 + tax and tips.

SERVICE!
Extremely good!!! I fell in love with the other waiter, not ours. Ours was amazing too. Please don't be jealous, hear me out. The other guy was just freaking nice and alive!!!! I think he works in the back (I sat near the door) and he brings food to the table. He doesn't take customer orders, he brings food from kitchen to table. But because the restaurant is ALWAYS so busy, he naturally helps out everything! Water. Changing tables. Checking up. Are we ok?? Napkins? Coming ASAP!!

The only awful staff is the coat lady who's at the front of the door and she takes in new customers. I guess it's good I mean, her face just tells people without reservations to get out.

Which reminds me. If you have no reservations, you'll be greeted by her and get kicked out. YOU NEED reservations.
