Yp1swb-8pO8i-6-jaK2tsA went here for lunch because it was someplace I used to eat many years ago in Los Angeles.  

It was not nearly as good as I remember it being, however it was cheap.

I ordered the grilled  salmon dish on the "Just Enough" menu, which was flavorful and was as good as something I would expect from a similar place like the Cheesecake Factory.  Being from Seattle and having had incredible salmon, I wish they would tell me where their salmon comes from, and the waiter could not tell me.  Yes I'm a salmon snob.  Don't hate.  

My husband had the french onion soup and it was the worst soup we've ever ate.  It was just some chicken broth with undercooked onions and a little cheese and bread on top.  It was horrid.  

He also had a Parmesan Chicken Ciabatta, and although he thought the flavor of the chicken was ordinary, he loved the ciabatta bread.

It is very cheap so we might go here again.  There are so many better dining options around town that I doubt we will.
