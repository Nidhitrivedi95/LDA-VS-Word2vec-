xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g I'm torn. The Eiffel Tower Restaurant is not deserving of 5 stars, yet it's not bad -- thus my dilemma. At the Eiffel Tower Restaurant, the view trumps the food. But since we're talking about a restaurant, food should always trump everything else, with the view as a perk.

When calling for a reservation, I inquired about a window seat. The man said the only way to guarantee the window at 6pm was through a special birthday dinner package, including a three-course dinner for 2, bottle of wine, professional photo at dinner, and an autographed restaurant cookbook. The package was an insane price, but since we were staying at another strip hotel for free, I thought, hey, we can spend something silly for dinner.

So here are my grades:
-View: A+ (of course)
-Presentation of food: A
-Service: C (service was no better than what I'd expect at Applebee's)
-Cauliflower purée/assorted breads: A 
-Mixed greens/creamy French onion soup: A
-Chicken entree: A+ (I never knew chicken could be SO tender!)
-Salmon entree: B- (underseasoned and did not taste super fresh)
-Chocolate cake dessert: D (frozen, not sweet and didn't seem fresh; the presentation at least made up for the cake)

While some dishes we ate (as well as the presentation and the window seat) were excellent, my main entree and birthday cake were disappointing. I felt a little slighted with dessert; to charge a customer such an enormous price for a fixed menu that includes chocolate cake as the only dessert option and to provide that customer such a lackluster dessert just doesn't seem right to me.

Our server was attentive and professional but pretty mediocre. She never chatted with us and did not explain the dishes when they arrived at our table. Similarly, the hostess in the restaurant did not acknowledge us until we said hello, and she did not say goodbye or thank you as we left. (The hosts by the restaurant elevator on the casino floor were great.)

We had a great experience since the view of the Bellagio fountains was fantastic. Unfortunately, not everything we ate was fantastic, and the service was average. For what we paid, I was expecting food and service that would knock my socks off -- and we didn't get that. 

In the end, because the food and service were not 5 stars for me, I don't plan on returning. I'm glad I went, though, and I enjoyed my experience.
