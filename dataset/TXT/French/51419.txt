P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ This was by far the longest (4 hours), most expensive meal of my life, and we didn't even order a bottle of wine. (3 glasses of champagne and one glass of red with the "main course"). The cheapest thing on the menu is the cheese plate ($35). After that, you will quickly surmise that you should get the $258 per person basic tasting menu, since just two or three items a la carte will add up to this sum. After the entire meal, and spending so much, you don't want to be left with the impression that the meal was "pretty good", but that's all I got. It was pretty good. Service was impeccable, bread cart not as good as Joel Robuchon but definitely one of the better ones, soup ok, the signature dishes very good. The chocolate dessert was fantastic. An event meal that was not worth the money. Try Alize or Joel Robuchon instead. Sorry Guy. It was just "pretty good."
