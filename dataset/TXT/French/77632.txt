YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g The food was pretty good, the service was very good, the ambience was good being inside of The Mandalay Bay and a great place for people watching. It's pricey. The pork sandwich I had was a little too wet but did taste good. The burgers that my sons had were pretty good. Wife's sandwich (not memorable) was pretty good too. Fries were excellent though. It's a toss up about whether it was worth the price. But here's the thing that makes it a 3 star rather than higher: Soft drink refills are not free. If Fleur is going to charge me 4.50 for a coke without free refills, then it had better be in a gigantic glass. Instead, it's a small tumbler mostly of ice. It is one of my biggest pet peeves that someone charges me a lot of money for a soft drink and doesn't offer free refills. It's irritatingly cheap. I will not be back. Too many other choices in Vegas. I like Keller's TV cooking show. Maybe I should've just gone to Burger Bar which I think is still his as well.
