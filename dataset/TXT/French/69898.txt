WOj8nPos3R9IIf0Pyttd8g My husband and I tried Sunday brunch at Lulu for our first visit, and we were pleasantly surprised.  For starters, Lulu is located in a charming, converted house with plenty of parking.  The atmosphere is quaint inside, and they play an enjoyable (if eclectic) mix of music.  The coffee is good and strong, just the way we like it.  My husband wanted something sweet, and got the creme brûlée French toast with a side of applewood bacon.  It was absolutely delicious!  I tried the Central Breakfast, your basic three-egg dish with bacon or sausage, toast, and grits or home fries.  The grits were thick, creamy, and really good.  The eggs--scrambled with cheese--were fluffy, but I was unimpressed that the cheese was just melted on top and not mixed in.  Why can't I seem to be able to get scrambled eggs cooked this way anywhere in Charlotte?!  Service was very attentive and our coffee cups were always full.  All in all, we were really pleased with Lulu and will definitely return.
