rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw I was initially disappointed when American Fish closed down, being a big fan of the happy hour they offered. I will say that disappointment was eased when I walked into Bardot Brasserie for brunch one day with the ladies. 

Home to the Everlasting Rose, this is brunch on another level. This brunch is elevated. Rose is one way to stand out on Champagne Sunday! There's lots of light, and there's some wonderful dishes including croissant benedicts in lobster and surf & turf varieties. 

For a decadent French onion soup, try adding the périgord truffle, braised short rib & poached egg. It's mouthwateringly good.
