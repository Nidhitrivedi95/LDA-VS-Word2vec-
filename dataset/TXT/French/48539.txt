ohMpNug5zWNxOlL6ShG7Ig Very charming little bistro with a very friendly vibe and great food.  You can tell that sourcing local and fresh is important to the chef - it is evident with the first bite.  Portion size is absolutely perfect - you should leave a restaurant being delighted by flavors but not so full you are uncomfortable. Cafe Bink delights.  If I had one thing I would change is their homemade lemonade is just s bit too sweet otherwise, this will become our favorite  local go to restaurant.
