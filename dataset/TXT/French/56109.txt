rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I just realized I had not reviewed this place, our visit was from 2010 for dinner and 2013 for breakfast. Breakfast was blah...my toast was burnt to crisp and when they burn brioche it is like eating dust! My son in law had croque Monsieur and liked his but my daughter did not like the hash at all. 
Dinner was too long ago to remember specifics but one funny thing happened on the way there. We always dress nice for dinner and we were coming down in the elevator of the Paris hotel and there was a guy in there dressed casually in jeans and button down shirt. He commented on how nice we all looked and when we said we were going to dinner he said oh must be some fancy place. We just smiled. Well a little while later when we arrive at Bouchon who should be in the line in front of us but the same guy from elevator dressed in jeans ready to eat!!  So don't bother dressing up for this place! 
Service was excellent both times we were there.
