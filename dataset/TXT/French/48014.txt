O3OH5IEFMPtz7mPKakPZ3Q We came in right when it opened on a Saturday and it was happy hour. I had a salmon taco, a beef taco, and the rock shrimp (I think that's what the last one is called). My bf had a beef taco, salmon taco, and Nigerian prawn. The tacos were amazing. The beef was so tender. The salmon was fresh. The shrimp had an amazing flavor. The Nigerian prawn was kinda difficult to eat but it was good. 

The server was really knowledgeable and nice. 

I know they use top quality meats and that's why some of the items are really pricey. However, I felt some items were a tad too pricey.
