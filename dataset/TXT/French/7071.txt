4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Really good food and excellent service! The terrace is really nice. The location is perfect, with views to the Bellagio fountains. We had the steaks with different sauces and they were all really good. The meat was cooked just like each one of us said they wanted it and the quality was really good. I had the sea scallops which were amazingly tasty! The only thing we didnt like was that our table was right under the air conditioning and some of us were cold. We asked the waitress to turn it down but she couldnt and instead, she brought some blankets. Totally recommendable!
