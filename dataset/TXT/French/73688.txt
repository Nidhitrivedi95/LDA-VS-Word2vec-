xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g Fabulous fancy lunch!!

We really enjoyed our lunch here on our last trip to Vegas. We had the kale salad, cheese platter, hamburger, and shrimp cocktail. Everything was to die for. 

Service was excellent... views were awesome... really nothing bad to say about this place.

We will be back.
