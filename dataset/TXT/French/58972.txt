rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w My husband and I had a great time here - the food was delicious and the service was beyond excellent. The dining room was smaller that I thought it would be and the space had an intimate feel. It wasn't loud and it was nice to be able to hear each other talk. The atmosphere was more elegant and less flashy than I expected from a Vegas restaurant. We went on a Tuesday night and the guests were anywhere between their 30s to 80s. I was wearing a bit of a Vegas-y dress and there was I moment I wished I had worn something slightly more modest, or at least had thrown a jacket on over my dress. My husband wore a sport coat, button down shirt, and dressy khakis. 

I had the lobster avocado salad, the sole (comes with sauteed veggies), an Edelweiss drink, and the chocolate sphere for dessert. I loved all of it. My husband had the lobster avocado salad, the chicken, a glass of Sauvignon Blanc, and the chocolate souffle (big serving!) and he also really enjoyed his meal. We were also crazy about their chocolate coffee bread. It was random but so good! 

Overall we had a wonderful time and we hope to visit again!
