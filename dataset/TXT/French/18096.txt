I visited here with my boyfriend's family for Mother's Day. As soon as I walked in, I was taken aback by the beautiful array of desserts. So many to choose from, and they were gorgeous! After making my way through to the back, we ordered breakfast platters and omelets (which is served all day long, don't let the blackboard fool you!).  Personally, their breakfast menu is very similar to a breakfast platter with eggs and meat and a side of toast at any other restaurant that serves breakfast. However, I do have to say that their croissant is freshly baked and yummy AND their bacon is pretty damn good, too. Unfortunately, I did not have a chance to explore the rest of their large variety of other food options so I'll have to go back.

I must say that the only reason for this 4 star review is because we had to wait a long while in order for everyone to even receive the drinks. My party also received our orders in different times so there was a small chaos brewing in the beginning of our breakfast. 

The desserts on the other hand was AMAZING. I had the salted caramel and vanilla macarons and they were delicious! I ended up buying one of each flavor for my best friend to try and she loved them all. I also had the profiteroles and they were by far the best I've tasted. It was filled with custard and topped with chocolate and whipped cream. I'll be going back every week to pick up one of those for me. :) Other people in my party had more fruity pastries and they did mention that they had too much fruit in them but I think it may be the French or Manon style of baking so... to each his own. 

Overall, the food is to be determined but desserts are a must try!
