gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA Great view, good food, great service.  We had the seasonal tasting menu.  I think there was about 8 courses. Pricing is reasonable for the tasting. Of the 8 courses I think 2 were not good.  The 'fresh' Hamachi carpacio was not fresh (was a bit fishy) being that I am from Hawaii I kinda know good fresh fish esp raw.  The beef course wasnt good either - beef was over done and salty.  Other than those glitches... was enjoyable.
