4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw The patio Mon Ami Gabi is simply one of the best places for breakfast in this town!   The food is great and the people watching is the BEST.   It gets pretty crowded on the patio starting at 9.30am so early is better - plus you get to see a wonderful parade of people walking the strip in their "evening clothes" after a lively night out.  The egg benedict is wonderful but if you want something lighter try the muesli - it is a fabulous mix of fruit topped with berries.
