SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ RAW, SEWAGE, MISERABLE! It was our wedding anniversary and we wanted it to be special so we called and I spoke to a great gal on the phone. I told her we were celebrating and would love it if they would accommodate us with an out of the way table - romantic. When we got there we were placed in a small room with 5 other tables. The foursome next to us was so loud we could barely hear each other. Then they sat a 6 top right next to us (2 feet between us and them), one of the women had on a terrible perfume which made my sinuses swell, so we asked to move. It was a Saturday night and they were busy and there were not many empty tables. They placed us at a 2 top next to the bathroom and we finished our dinner with the aroma of sewage. Blah! We were not offered any dessert for our celebration (we did get 2 half glasses of sparkling cider). My husband had the fish of day for $28.00 and he said it was mediocre. I had the chicken for $26.00 and it was ok. I didn't finish it so I took it home to feed my critters. The next day when I was cutting it up, I discovered it was raw inside. The table was not lit well enough for me to see it the night before. Needless to say we spent $87.56 on our meal (food only) and we were very disappointed. We were looking for something special to celebrate and the House of Tricks fell drastically short. We will not return and it was miserable enough that I will pass that information on to everyone. It was a big year anniversary and we can't get it back.
