2B46bRpDh49eDyjXGhL_ZQ Had a lovely lunch today.   France Gallette very yummy and such a welcoming owner!  We chatted for a while and,  after I mentioned that I love chocolate but dislike nutella (which is what they have), she surprised me with a treat free of charge!  She had made chocolate crepes for a special event that morning and had leftover batter  - so she cooked one up with butter and sugar and it was awesome!  This is a true hidden gem and I will be coming back!
