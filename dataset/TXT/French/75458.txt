Ycp3Agr7dt71TZkeKV7jng This is my favorite coffee shop in Toronto.  Yes, as everyone raves, the cookies are delicious - chocolate chip walnut is my favorite.  I also recommend the Nutella hot chocolate.  I'd like to try some other items as everything I've had has been consistently good.  Unlike some other Yelpers, I've consistently received good service and good vibes from everyone that works there.  They just need free wifi to push it over the top.
