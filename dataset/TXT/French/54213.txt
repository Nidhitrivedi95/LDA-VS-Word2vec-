rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw We had Valentine's Day dinner, at the bar. The atmosphere transforms you to a small bistro in France. The staff was very, very busy, but was still very attentive to guests at their tables and the bar. 

I started with the French Onion Soup. It was some of the best I have ever had! It was in a large crock with lots of melted cheese on top. They serve warm baguette in paper bags with soft butter. Yummy! My husband started with the late and he said it too was very good. 

The entrees were let downs for both of us. I had the sea bass. It was slightly over cooked and left it dry. He ordered the lamb frites and was disappointed when the plate only had 4 thick fries. When he asked how long it would take to order a side of fries he was told 15-20 minutes. He passed. He did say that the lamb was prepared well. When the manager saw the bartender remove my plate he immediately came over and asked why I didn't finish it. His concern was greatly appreciated. Although it wasn't necessary he did send us desert on him. 

Overall I give them a little slack since it was Valentine's Day and they were completely booked. The staff clearly was busting their butts to make it a memorable evening for everyone. Thank you! Bee would try them again.
