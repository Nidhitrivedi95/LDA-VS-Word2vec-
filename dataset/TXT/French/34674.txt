HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw My friends and I were beyond excited to try this spot out.  We've heard great things about the one in LA.

Granted we had the last reservation, so that may have something to do with the issues we had.  We ordered the tart and cheese platter as appetizers.  Both good, but nothing to rave about.  We were given bread for the table that was as hard as a rock.

Our entrees took close to an hour to arrive.  We ordered the pork chop (which the waiter raved about), the risotto, and the salmon.  The pork chop was so chewy and hard to cut.  The risotto was served like tatter tots, fried into three tiny pieces on my plate.  The salmon was practically raw and still cold.  We sent all three dishes back.  A first ever.

The manager there at the time handled the situation very well and comped our appetizers.  Just maybe I'll return based on their customer service, but we did need to go find dinner after!
