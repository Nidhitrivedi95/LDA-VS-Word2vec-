50-xiTYmE6NERi-yJ6NvHw Treated my wife for her b-day last year. Made reservation online requesting for a table in the corner of the restaurant as i wanted to make it an intimate evening as it was my wife's bday. 
To my surprise, we did get a special table. It was special because it was in the corner. As soon as we sat, we got a glass of wine on the house 'compliments of management' for the occasion. Then once we ordered, we got free apps and 3 different types of desserts 'compliments of the chef for the princess' with a small candle in the middle of a french pastry. 
Besides all that, the food was amazing, ambience-awesome. Service -top notch. 
Highly recommend it for either a business lunch or a romantic feast.
