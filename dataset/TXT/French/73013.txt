XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q Absolutely amazing. Forget the A la Carte and small portions for a minute, and take in all the incredible surprises. Lobster salad and the Sea Scallop were perfect, along with the service and ambiance. Prices are high, but ya only live once.
Bread service too with a decadent wine list
