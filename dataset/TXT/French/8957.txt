4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Despite the raving reviews posted here, we had a less than enjoyable time for our anniversary dinner. Most of it was spoiled by our waitress, who was too bossy at the table with my wife and acted impatient. She brought us a plate of the full mussel dish that had become cold. had to send it back... And then made to feel bad about it. As we were walking out she mentioned that she had forgotten to bring us something for our celebration... But in an off handed way to make us feel bad. unfortunately I would not recommend this for anyone.
