ZdaZwXC0FByDY3EwNELphw Oh yuck!!  This place was terrible!!!!!  We had a reservation for 9pm and were not seated until past 9:30pm with no apology or compensation. Food was mediocre and overpriced. If I'm going to spend $30 on  my main, I can think of MUCH better places to go. Terrible!!!!  I think people are more excited about being in trendy Ossington than realizing their dinner is not good!!!!!  Oh, never again!!!!  No thank you!!!!  If I'd spent $9 on my crappy dinner, I'd still be annoyed.
