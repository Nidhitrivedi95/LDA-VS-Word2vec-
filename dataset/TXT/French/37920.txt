jaSowNITPRRCYpPb3_pjdA Just dined for Brunch. Fabulous! This gem of a Bistro is wonderful. we dined on the Patio, very relaxing. Nice place to take out of town guests. It's off the Strip, and bonus, free parking! The endless Mimosas were delicious. Try the Omelets, delicious, also the Belgian Waffles. Yummmm.
