ynYEgNimJOyb8dvyr9x0sA I'd like to start by saying that I wish I could give this place 3 and a half stars. If you read my other reviews I'd love to point out this place is notably better than many of the 3 star places I have reviewed. 

Le Chalet is an amazing place for newcomers to swiss food. The fondue is great but the best things come from their unique cultural dishes like the savory crepes & wraps. Throw away what you know about crepes and wraps and begin to rebuild here. The La Potence one of their signature dishes looks a bit gimmicky but they pull it off well. Its paired with a bunch of different sauces, some better than others but overall very satisfying. Dessert is a no brainer, the sweet crepes will deliver on what your looking for.
