yAkT-tNGut0rbWlA7kjrdg I love this place, it meets all my macarons needs. Hopped in the other day for a wee treat and walked out with 4 macarons and a pear and almond tart (not ALL for me, I promise!) 

The pear and almond tart was just amazing. I don't know what they did to those pears, but they were sweetened perfectly and had an amazing fragrance to them. 

The almond crust with thick and crunchy, and 'peared' perfectly with the fruit (haha, see what I did there?)

A must try if you're hanging around the Stockbridge area. 

Personally, I'm not much for the coffee in this shop, but a slice of cake and a cup of tea never hurt anyone, right?
