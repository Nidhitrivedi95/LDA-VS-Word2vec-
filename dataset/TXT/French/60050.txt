Cons: Expensive ($160 (food) + $120 (drinks pairings) per person)

If you're down for foodie adventures and you're willing to spend some money for great food and service, you should check this place out.

First of all, you have to make a reservation via email (i.e. reserver@ebyjoseandres.com) up to a month in advance.  When it gets close to your reservation date, you get mailed golden tickets (a la Willy Wonka style).

On the day of your reservation, you actually dine in a small room with 8 seats.  All dishes are prepared in front of you.

Here are some notable dishes:

Crispy Chicken Skin in Escabeche - Perfectly seasoned chicken skin and chicken oyster
Uni slider - I love uni. You should too.
Secreto of Iberico pork - It's like the filet mignon of pork. Moist fatty deliciousness

Overall, great experience.  Our servers and the chefs were super nice and willing to answer any questions that diners might have.  The only issue is the food is a little pricey for my tastes.

However, if you're looking to celebrate a special occasion and want to witness molecular gastronomy in person, give this place a try.
