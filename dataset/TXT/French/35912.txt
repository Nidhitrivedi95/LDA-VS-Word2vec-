hvjgF-vnPw2jyL5DBuB0qg Dropped in after noticing how close we were from our hotel and I have watched Chuck Hughes on his cooking shows for years.  We did not have a reservation and we purposely allowed our 15yr old to eat out in advance and then hang out on the wifi in our room since according to the online reservation site- no one under 18yr is allowed in...? The hostess gave us an early table with the understanding that the table was already reserved in 2hrs so we would need to be through by then which was totally fine.
    The 3 of us split the lobster poutine appetizer- plenty of food and wonderful and rich.  I had the cod filet and it had a delicious golden crust and was seasoned really well- salty but I really enjoyed it. My husband tried the pork cheeks which he also enjoyed.  Our 18yr old daughter had the steak and really enjoyed it but recommended eating it with greens if you start with a poutine appetizer instead of ordering the side of fries.
     The vibe of the restaurant was very cool blending Old Montreal and its character with the modern open kitchen and chic style.  Love the lighting! My husband walked right by the front door. You have to be paying attention- it is a small front with no specific labeled sign: just a white neon panel that lights up red when they are open.  The front door opens to a small foyer and you must push and walk through the heavy black curtain to find the check in table. 
   Worth trying out- a little pricey and you must work around their limited hours- but definitely a good stop in Old Montreal!
