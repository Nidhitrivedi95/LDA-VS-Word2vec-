IvFdi-vp823dTAWwHMT6xQ I have only been at the Monte Carlo to eat at this restaurant and each time the quality of food disappoints me.

Staff: Friendly and helpful. They usually get our food and drink orders quick and they come in a timely manner.

Ambience: Nothing special to note. Each time we come it is a larger party and they give us a long table, but they don't have long tablecloths so there's a lot of overlap of small tablecloths on the table making it lack that professional touch. On this Halloween occasion they did decorate with Halloween items, but it was odd to see a bloody machete prop dangling above your head while you eat.

Food: Everything seems like it comes out of the box. The fish and chips is the saddest plate I've ever seen. It is a square piece of fish with fries all lackadaisically placed on the plate. Someone I knew ordered the pizza and it was very soggy on the bottom and the pineapple tasted like it was from a can. My friend had the pork chops and they have a nice sweet glaze on it which wasn't too bad but the side veggies look like it came out of a frozen bag. I had the pasta linguine with meatballs and it tasted good but I wish the meatballs were homemade.

As a hotel restaurant they need to step up their game a little. I suggest sticking to the pastas and/or pork chops!
