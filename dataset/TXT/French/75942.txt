ynYEgNimJOyb8dvyr9x0sA Terrible service.  NOT kid friendly.  Restaurant should be ashamed of themselves for the way they treat customers. I was with the Vivianna and could not believe the service we received. Will never return to this restaurant and want to the restaurant across the street that was packed. No wonder this restaurant was empty.
