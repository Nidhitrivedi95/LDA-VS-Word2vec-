x_1Yo9ArcbitR6NQC7tOUA We were at nearby high park and wanted food nearby. Stumbled on Sparrow. We got in just after brunch had ended on a Sunday so we had he "Snacks" menu -- which has poutine, fries, charcuterie, etc. Price ranges around $6-$15 for snacks 

Got the Assorted Pickles plate and the Fries. For $6, we got a decent amount of fries. Enough for two people to split. Comes with ketchup and mayo--which I think were made in house. They tasted like it. Loved the mayo.

The Assorted Pickles plate is pretty good. Several pickled veggies (pear/apple?, cauliflower, garlic) as well as actual pickles.

The beer menu wasn't very large and was on the more pricey side ($7 and up). Felt it was overpriced for the selection.

I feel like we didn't hit this place at a great time so I feel biased, I bet brunch is better. But a satisfying spot. 

A surprise: Cool bathrooms downstairs!
