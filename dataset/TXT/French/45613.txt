mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q We were not impressed by our experience here.  We were with a large group, all of whom got the seasonal discovery.  We did the smaller tasting and it was ok.  Both of us were not impressed with our main courses.  My halibut was dry and tasteless.  Husband got chicken and it was nothing amazing.

We did both enjoy our desserts though.  I had the tart selection and he got the sorbet and ice creams.  all yummy.  Definitely not a place we would go back to, though I think we might enjoy the main Joel Robuchon restaurant better.  The trendy haute style cuisine wasn't really our style.

Plus - we're from the bay so good restaurants are plentiful.  When I got to Vegas, I think I should experience something better than what I can go to in SF.
