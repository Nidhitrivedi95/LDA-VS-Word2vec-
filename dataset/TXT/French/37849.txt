jaSowNITPRRCYpPb3_pjdA Without doubt...the best local secret! Quality of service, food and most importantly, fresh produce makes this our go to place.

Brunch, lunch, glass of wine and appetizers, happy hour and dinner.

Andre treats his staff like family and it shows!

100% recommend 

Well done Andres Family/staff  We love you!
