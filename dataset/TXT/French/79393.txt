Zl6csaZ5HBka3SKBphHXrQ Dined at  Midi for Summerlicious with my friends. The food was great and customer service was outstanding.   We all ordered the mushroom salad to start(  I got mine without cheese). I was impressed by the customer  service because they accommodated my request without a fuss . We got the fish of the day main and the steak.    One of my friends had a question regarding  his steak dish .  he was wondering whether the Garlic Vermouth Sauce  came separately from the  Sun-Dried Tomato Butter . The manager came out and  explained   how the two were mixed together . I was very impressed at the managers politeness and willingness to explain how the dish was . 
Midi is a decent place to dine and we will definitely be back  due to the excellent customer service.  My only concern   ( loss of one star on this review) was the presence of just one server for  the tables present. Please have at least three servers  or two at the minimum  scheduled to work  on the floor   during the busy periods. It was very saddening to see one server running around  when they would not have needed to had there been more servers .
