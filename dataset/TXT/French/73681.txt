xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g I wish every restaurant in Miami was as good as this one! You have to go in through the casino of the hotel and you are led up to the restaurant through an elevator where you are greeted and check in. I made a reservation and requested a fountain view table for our anniversary dinner. 

As we waited to be seated were had some drinks by the car which is rather small, but drinks are pretty good. Finally we sat down to our fountain view table. Best view in town!!!! The fountains play every 15 minutes at night time, it's the most beautiful thing ever! We ordered the filet mignon and it's the most delicious filet I've ever had! Everytime I order it here even in the best restaurant in Miami, it's doesn't come even CLOSE to the filet in this restaurant. Cooked to perfection! 

The service was impeccable, our waitress was excellent! This restaurant is very "high end" so you get the service you're paying for! I plan to go back to Vegas at the end of the year and this will definitely be one of my stops for dinner!!!
