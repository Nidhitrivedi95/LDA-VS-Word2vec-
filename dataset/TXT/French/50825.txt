Well, this is my second time in this restaurant, as I was here just about a year ago, when I was literally blown off my seat by this enchanting experience. 

Going through the series of possible outcome, there were 3 possibilities of experience I would encounter: worse, same or better.  I immediately discounted "better", since nothing can beat that unique first experience I had.   "Same" would not be logical after 1 year, since everything changes with time, especially in restaurant kitchen.  By process of elimination, I concluded this experience would be lower.  Far lower, than my first experience in this restaurant. Again comparatively speaking. 

Let me tell you that I could not have been more wrong.  Perhaps the very few times that I was happy to be wrong. 

My colleague and I experienced a serenade of culinary appetizers, each of which was more exciting than the previous one and all bursting with flavours.  

Our entire dinner was showcasing the culinary landscape of goddess Ambrosia where Food, Science and Art work in perfect partnership.  

The chef must be busy experimenting to invent ostensibly bizarre dishes that were unbelievably out of this world.

So if you love to eat high on the hog, and love to have a toothsome experience, you know where to go. 

And if you are invited to Europea Restaurant do like Sheryl Sandberg when she was offered a job at Google. She said "If you are offered a seat on a rocket ship , don't ask what seat. Just get on."

Hmmm, I can be fussy when it comes to washroom.  Don't get me wrong.  The washroom was clean.    Not sure if Goddess Hygeia would approve though.  I would have liked to see the washroom up a notch with some innovation to match the amazingly great service standards.
