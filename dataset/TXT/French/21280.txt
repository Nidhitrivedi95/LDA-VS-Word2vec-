B56AYe5GNuavMDtwFsXqzA Chowhound has produced a list of the 78 most annoying words to read in a restaurant review. I am well aware of this list and I know damn well the one word many readers would love to see at the top of that list is the word "unctuous". But I don't care. Unctuous is the only word that I could think of to describe the braised veal cheek I had at Petite Maison last night.  I would have given them 5 stars because of the great food and the charming atmosphere but I can't. It was too damn hot in there. It was 105 degrees all day so eating dinner in a warm dining room at 9pm wasn't an ideal situation. Maybe they are having some problems with their AC unit. I'll definitely be back..... after summer has passed.
