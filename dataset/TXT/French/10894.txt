4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I love this resturant. my bf usually gets their steak and eggs and he loves it and the fries are very thin.. I've tried their French toast and the shrimp scampi and they were delicious.. Highly recommend it and try to get a table outside/the patio so u can enjoy the   View of the strip :)
