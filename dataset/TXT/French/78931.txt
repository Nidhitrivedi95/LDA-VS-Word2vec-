The service is generally good, the lunch menu is much better than breakfast!  I absolutely loved their chicken soup, it was rich and thick, and creamy, delicious.  The must say the chicken salad sandwich is nothing special.  Also steer clear of the hashes, they were way too large, and not very good.

Coffee and sodas, thumbs up!
