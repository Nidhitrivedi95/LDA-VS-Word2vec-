hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA We made the trek over here for lunch today from my workplace on the strip and it was DELICIOUS!!! My only complaint is that it's not open on the weekends! 

When we walked in, the owner was the one taking the orders. He asked if we had been there before, and when we said no, he explained the whole menu to us. He was SO personable! After we had gotten our food, he checked on our table outside to see how everything was. His service was outstanding, and I wish every place I went to had this great of service. It also helps that is french accent is to DIE for ;)

Ok, so onto the meal. I had the chicken pesto sandwich special. It was FULL of flavor. Sundried tomato pesto really made the whole sandwich pop. The bread was fresh, soft and chewy. It matched the sandwich perfectly. The chicken was delicious as well. It was perfectly cooked, and not dry. I seriously can't even say how awesome this place is! 

My table also split the chocolate tart. Can you say HEAVEN? Cause that's where I was when I was devouring it. It's rich and creamy. The slice was HUGE, and enough for 4 people to share.  I kinda want to go back just for that! 

If you haven't been here, you need to come STAT. Like I said, I wish it was open on the weekends cause I would be here every Saturday for lunch!
