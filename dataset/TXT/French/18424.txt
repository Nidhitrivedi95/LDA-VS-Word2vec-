A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g Tried the eclairs..chocolate & vanilla.  Absolutely wonderfull!  The vanilla was made with real vanilla beans, no extract or flavoring.  Filling was light & creamy.  Moderate pricing for such a high quality product.  The eclairs cost $5.00 for the two and each eclair was about eight inches long.  I would've gladly paid $5.00 for just one!
