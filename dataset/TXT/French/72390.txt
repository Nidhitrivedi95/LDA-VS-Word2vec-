XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q Our experience did not start off well. I called the restaurant the morning of our reservations (booked a month in advance) to coordinate our limo ride, but to my surprise, they could not find our reservation! Panicked, I double-checked my email confirmation and gave them my confirmation number. The reservation was definitely nowhere to be found. Thankfully, there was an opening for the same night, though the limo service was all booked up. I wouldn't normally have been bummed about it, but I read all the glowing reviews mentioning the secret Mansion, which I did not want to miss. The concierge later told me that my reservation was cancelled, but do not know why.

Despite the disappointment, we ordered the 16-course meal, and enjoyed every bit of it. Food, service, and presentation were all wonderful. I couldn't help but compare to others (like French Laundry, Alinea, Benu, etc), and found the service to be slightly off. Uneven pacing between courses, awkward periods when service people would congregate near our table and chit-chat. We're nit-picking, but I do not expect that type of thing at this caliber restaurant. Our main server was quite good though, and made our meal less stuffy than it could've been. Yes, the dining room was quiet, but there was music playing and the volume of others in the dining room picked up throughout our 3 hours there. Another picky thing is that I didn't necessarily like the strange photos as part of the place-settings, accompanying a few of the dishes.

I did like the bread and dessert carts. The Langostine ravioli and caviar dishes were stand-outs for me.

Overall, a good experience and worthy of a 5 star review. I would not return for the $395 menu, but maybe one of the smaller meals, and hopefully be able to get a ride to the mansion next time.
