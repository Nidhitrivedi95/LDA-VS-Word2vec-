K64Uw3a2Enh2MznpwRHWKQ The food was pretty good, but overpriced and the portions were a little small.  When we went last Saturday night, we were about the youngest people in the restaurant, and we are middle-aged. I think the place is tired and resting on long ago earned laurels.  And, my paella had cream in it. What is up with that?
