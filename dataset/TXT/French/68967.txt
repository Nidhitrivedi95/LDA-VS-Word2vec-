VwZhwflLnTq19aAeFLJHCQ Let's try this with bullet points: 
- The multiple Eiffel Towers:  Lose the Eiffel Tower wrapped in fake greenery and adorned with Christmas lights...half of which don't work.  It's also awkwardly placed.  Take the glittery gold 3 foot high one out to the desert with a 6-pack and a shotgun. 
- Either get better lighting or keep the fluorescent DMV lighting off.  They were flickering the whole time I was there and gave me a nervous tick.  
- If you're going to say you're French, OWN IT and don't try to pander to the world by offering Indian, Italian, American, Moroccan and Japanese (ok...maybe sushi wasn't actually on the menu)
- Your signature beet and goat cheese salad?  The beets had the same flavor, shape and even indentations of the can from which they came.  Beets are roundish and have flavor.  Masking canned beets with goat cheese hurt my feelings. 
- A waitress should never ask if you mind if your dinner comes out a bit late because another table is being needy.  
- GREAT, STUPENDOUS mashed potatoes...but I have horrible taste in what good mashed potatoes look like...so I might be off there.  
- I also really liked the way the Caesar salad was plated...very cool. 

Highly recommended if you have a sense of humor and it's not an important business dinner.
