-Steak is very, very thin. Ask for anything other than well done and you will be disappoint. 
-Servers come around once asking if you want coffee, and then rarely ever again for refills.

Actually been here twice already even though I've only checked in once. 
First time, we came for lunch and I got the steak. I made a huge mistake of ordering my steak rare. Because the steak is so thin, I pretty much got a medium-done steak. The steak was pretty tasty, but I really do prefer my steaks/burgers RARE, so I was very disappointed. 
The second time, I was there for breakfast/brunch. I got the egg white omelet. The consistency of the omelet is very interesting... it's INCREDIBLY fluffy, which was a bit weird to me at first, but still pretty tasty. It can be a bit bland though, so I added a bit of salt and it was perfect. 
I hear the french toast is amazing, and will be getting that next time!
