AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw Great brunch stop at Caesars.  Open at 0630.  Best to use Opentable reservation since it has limited seating.  Everything fresh and Id likely break the no eggs Benedict rule here.   You can see kitchen in middle of dining area.  Coffee strong.  Pastries and Brioche French toast excellent.
