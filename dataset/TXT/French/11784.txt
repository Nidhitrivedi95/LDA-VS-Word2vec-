4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Had a lovely dinner here. The service was prompt and friendly and the food was delicious.

We went here on a Thursday night at 8pm and there was about a 5 minute wait to be seated, which was fine. There was a 20-30 min wait for the patio (to watch the Bellagio water show). 

We were in and out in around 40 minutes. We ordered the small garden salad, the steak frites and the salmon with pea and carrots. All the meals were very tasty. The salad came out almost as an appetiser, rather than with our main meals but that was fine.

The service was very friendly and efficient, the water boy was particularly attentive, which was great given it had been so hot and I was drinking lots of water.

The restaurant was busy but didn't feel packed due to the layout so it was not particularly noticeable.
