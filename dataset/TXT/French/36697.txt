IE-FSNn9Zx9YFx3nJV4C1A Popped into Montreal on an overnighter and wanted to eat some French bistro food and Beaver Hall did a great job at meeting that need. 

The food was very good - my calamari was excellent (tender and tasted of the sea) while my flank steak was nicely charred on the outside and medium rare as I had requested (though thicker than I prefer). My girlfriend's beef carpaccio and white sausage were both very good and large in size.  We were too stuffed to enjoy any dessert but would expect them to be very tasty (and affordable).

Service was friendly but the restaurant did seem a bit understaffed as our waitress was definitely running around a lot despite being calm and polite when she spoke with us. 

Overall, I would definitely would return.
