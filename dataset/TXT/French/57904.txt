Thee macarons here are subpar! I actually got to try the Bouchon in Beverly Hills some months after trying the ones from Las Vegas and I have to say the ones from The Beverly location tasted much much better! 

Maybe it was my bad for buying the ones that were already preboxed...? That totes shouldn't matter. Oh well.
