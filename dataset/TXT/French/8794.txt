4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Please do yourself a favor and come here on your next Vegas trip! We made a reservation on OpenTable at 9 pm for 2. When we got there, I asked for patio seating because from other reviews I read, the view of the Fountains of the Bellagio was a must. They told me it could be about a 30 minute wait, but to our surprise we only waited about 5 minutes to be seated. The outdoor patio seating was worth it! While enjoying your food not only can you feel the rush of the Vegas strip, you can watch the Bellagio Fountains show, as well as live entertainment from artists playing on the strip. This night we got lucky that a saxophonist was playing nearby which added to the whole ambiance and experience. 

For food options, I decided to order the caramelized sea scallops with the asparagus, snap peas and the minted pea purée. I ate everything single thing on the plate it was that good. Also, my boyfriend ordered ratatouille and I have never tried so what better place to do so than here. It was also very appetizing. Nice location for a nice romantic dinner!
