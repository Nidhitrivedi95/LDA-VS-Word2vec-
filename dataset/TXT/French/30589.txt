fVF5wayDyY6ZR5oJB1IK3g Brunch at Lawrence was my favorite meal in Montreal. 

First, I love a place that can do a good brunch cocktail beyond the standard mimosa and bloody mary (or rather, the related Caesar if you're in Canada). Their aperol spritz was simple, refreshing, and just what I was looking for. 

DONUTS! Get the donuts!! We got an assortment of three (lemon was my favorite) and they were just amazing. 

Then.... THE EGG BAKE. Celery root, oyster mushrooms, cheese, and eggs. Dear. God. It was such a stellar combination, and quite different from any brunch dish I've had. I would go back in a heartbeat for this. Oh, and the incredible (sourdough?) bread that it came with.

And I almost forgot about the scones! Moist. With delicious jam and clotted cream.

The only almost-downside of the day was a bit of 'tude from the guy who seated us. 

"How many?"
"Three? Or maybe four."
"Hrmf. We have no space for maybes." 

....though the only table open was a 4-seater anyway, so it all worked out fine.
