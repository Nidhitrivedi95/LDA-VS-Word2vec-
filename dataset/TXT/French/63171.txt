SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA I visit from California every month, and I make it my purpose to stop every single time. 

I have tried every single dish in the menu and they are delicious! My favorites are the Cassoulet and the Almond Trout!  

The wine selection is very fitting (as are the beers). 

The service is consistently impeccable and they will accommodate your requests! 

Overall, this is a place you will come back to, again and again! 

Worth every penny!
