rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Such a disappointing experience after a fabulous weekend with girlfriends in Vegas.  Visually it's beautiful, classic dark wood, sparkling white table cloths, pale yellow walls, huge French doors leading onto an outdoor patio - very French looking.

It makes me sad to report that while the food had a few delicious high points, but mostly average, the service was so poor that it spoiled the expierience. The special, flat iron steak eggs benedict, was served barely lukewarm to 3 of my dining companions. Even the cast iron serving dishes were cold. Another guest had ordered her bacon extra crispy only to have it delivered soft.

While I think that everyone wasn't completely turned off by their meals, they certainly weren't worth writing home about or coming back to try again.  Other small mistakes were made with our ordering and the waiter was quite rude when we had to flag him down to bring it to his attention.  Taking into account the miserable service, the sadly average food is not worth a second round.

Happily, I can say that our dinner at another spot off the strip magnificently made up for our brunch at Bouchon.
