C3PVq7UpeHd6nz1_e-AtkA On the hunt for outdoor seating we ended up at Kalendar.
I've heard (and read) a lot about their brunch, but I was curious about dinner.

It's a small cozy restaurant.  If you are able to score a place on the patio or a table by a large open window, it's great.  Otherwise, the rest of the indoor seating is cramped and dark.

The first thing I reached for was the drink menu.  They had a good selection of cocktails, we had sangria which was fruity and not too sweet.  A bit pricey by the glass in my opinion.

The warm apple walnut salad was a great start to our meal.
It smelled delicious and the goat cheese and apple were awesome together.  The salad was fantastic, but I wish it was bigger.

The lobster ravioli was perfectly cooked and tasty.  Just the right potion and you could actually taste the lobster.

My friend had the steak and vegetables.  It tasted alright, I feel like they didn't quite cook it at a high enough temperature.  
I'm really glad I got the ravioli.

I kept glancing at people eating scrolls (the Kalendar version of roti).  It smelled good, but I'm unconvinced that I would be pleased.  If I want Indian food, I'd probably go to an actual Indian restaurant.  I hate bland curry that looks like curry but tastes like disappointment.

I'm sure I'll be back, perhaps for brunch.  Let's see if I can get my rating up to a four star.
