jaSowNITPRRCYpPb3_pjdA Excellent restaurant off the strip. Its nice to have a higher quality local restaurant and not have to schlep out to the strip just for dinner. The new location is in a plain strip mall, but the restaurant itself has great curb appeal. It has the same layout of the former DW Bistro, but it has a French farm-to-table feel once you walk inside.

The blonde waitress we had (apologize that the name escapes me if she is reading this) was excellent and has been with Andre for a number of years. Always a good sign when the staff is loyal to the brand! We all ordered French onion soup and I had the mussels and frites. French Onion Soup was a tad underwhelming considering that we were at a French restaurant but the mussels and frites were divine. Mussels is my go-to order whenever I see it on a menu, and Andres' mussels reminded me of the time I lived in France- so good!

Of course we had to try the grand mariner soufflé which was the best thing I had all night. Make sure you place your order with your food! It was heaven.

I checked out their brunch menu while I was there, looks excellent and can't wait to go back!
