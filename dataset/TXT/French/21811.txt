bgzMrz4qzEfJ7qqNthcveA Came here with a friend for dinner, at around 6:30PM.  We were the only ones there.  Staff were friendly, and we had the meal at an unhurried pace with no one rushing us out of there (admittedly, the restaurant was not full by the time we left around 10PM!)  Ordered quite a few dishes - pork rillettes, galette de sarassin, veal ravioli, flat iron steak, tartiflette, and the panna cotta for dessert.  Pork rillettes were tasty, but nothing to write home about.  Liked the endive in the galette de sarassin and the crepe plus brie plus sweet potato (?) was a great combo.  The veal ravioli was good, and the piece de resistance was the flat iron steak, which was covered in white truffle oil.  The steak was perfectly medium rare.  Tartiflette was slightly heavy.  The only reason why the star was missing for me was because something in the panna cotta didn't quite sit right in my stomach, but the bourbon honey was a nice touch!
