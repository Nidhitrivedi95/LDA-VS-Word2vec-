WOd8tWsh2Yt_osHv-ngx_w We had a fabulous brunch on the terrace (nicely protected by windows which can be adjusted).  It looks a little sketchy from outside, but be brave, it is quite nice inside. The menu is fairly extensive & appealing. Their juices are amazing mixes of fresh puréed fruits-the Asteroid (raspberries, strawberries, blueberries, cranberries & honey) was a symphony of fruit in our mouths.  The 2 eggs, bacon, ham and sausages with toast, coffee and potatoes (crispy good!) was generous in portion & taste. But go for the French crepes-they are SO good!  2 of us shared the crepes with assorted fresh fruit and custard and had plenty to fill us for the day. There was easily 2 cups of fruit (kiwi, strawberries, blueberries, bananas, kiwi, apples, grapes, melons and oranges. The crepes were perfectly crisp and tender. The servers were attentive and pleasant. Suffice to say, we found a new favorite!
Returned and can say breakfast pizza and jambon and egg bagel are delish as well.
