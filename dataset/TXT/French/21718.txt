Bf-yMQiSmDZyqfGyFKQ0bA Small restaurant bar. I love this place. Great drinks and food. The red sangria was amazing ! I had the teriyaki chicken wrap and it was delicious ! Huge selection of beers. 

The waiter was very nice and helpful.  He told us how the ingredients are from local farms. Atmosphere was comfortable and laid back. 
I highly recommend this place !
