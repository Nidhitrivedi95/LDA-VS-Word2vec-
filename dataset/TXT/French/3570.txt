1ThbwFVBL9YA2oOM11iO7g Delux restaurant located on the very hip ossington strip is a wonderful eatery.   Everything there is done to perfection with subtle modesty.  The interior of the restaurant is warm, welcoming and tastefully decorated.  Castor design type lights hang in the entrance way, giving the place an instant funky industrial look. On the right side of the wall hanging over some cozy booths is an interesting Technicolor alphabet light installation which some how does not look tacky at all.  There are some random industrial, metal chairs throughout the bistro.   I really enjoy the design and atmosphere at Delux.   They achieve an ambiance that is contemporarily chic and cool without it coming across as being contrived or pretentious.  Service was excellent, our server was very knowledgeable and an obvious foodie.   I ordered the Steak Frites and it was delightful.  The meat was cooked to perfection, was very tender and flavourful.  The French fries were delicious.  I was very pleased with this meal. For dessert we tried the donuts that were freshly baked for us.   I felt like Homer Simpson having a love affair with the dessert.  Prices range from $10-15 for tapas, $19-30 for entrees which all incorporate a classic French style cuisine.   Well worth the price for such delicious flavours.  Spend your hard earned bucks at Delux. 

I highly recommend Delux!
