rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I love everything Bouchon.

Amidst the bustle that is Las Vegas, you can escape into this haven.  It is nestled on the 10th floor at Venezia Tower.  The decor inside is amazing, as soon as you step inside you are transported to a French bistro. Tall windows let in plenty of natural light.  I melted into one of their booths sipping on a glass of Cremant de Alsace, completely grateful for the serenity of my surroundings.

Was joined by 4 others to indulge in a leisurely dinner. 

The fresh baked Fugasse that is unceremoniously delivered directly onto the clean white table is beautifully formed and baked to crisp and airy perfection.  The vegetarian me, got lucky as their Pâtes du Jour was a mushroom based dish, it was earthy, rich and satiating.  

Oh boy oh boy there are no words to describe what we were delivered for dessert.. The Berry Pavlova, this cloud of sweet indulgence was served with what I can only say are the most extraordinary strawberries I had ever tasted!!  They tasted like real strawberries, not the stuff we have got used to buying at the grocery store, but the small delicate ones that some of us have had the privilege of picking straight off the bush and biting into, to have an explosion of flavor fill our being.. I would go back just for that..  Also their Pommes Frites and Oeufs Mimosa are not to be missed.

Bouchon delivers quality, service, attention and overall leaves you feeling blissfully satisfied.

It is by no means cheap, but certainly you will get your money's worth.  Especially in contrast with all the overpriced and under par restaurants Vegas has a plenty.
