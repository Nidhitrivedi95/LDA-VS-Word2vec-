4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I went there with the party of 5 on December 2011. The food was okay, but it wasn't a pleasant service at all. We ordered about 7 menus, but the orders came very late. However, they were servicing two mafia looking men very nice & quick when those men were talking about coming out of a prison & stuff. The waitress charged us extra on the orange juice refills after I asked & confirmed that it was free refill. It seemed that one of the waitress didn't speak English & she got confused or something. I felt really bad & ripping off.
