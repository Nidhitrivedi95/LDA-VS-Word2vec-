vLkKorA1gPS97Zj0_WKA0Q Came to Twist to celebrate a bday dinner. Stayed at Mandarin. Great service and our table provided an incredible view of the strip. I had the 4-course prix fixe. My entree was lamb and I was pleased. The presentation of everything was superb.

Now for the cons: I didn't like their desserts at all. Not enough sweets. When just my order alone is $140 and I pay $6 for a coke, I didn't like being charged another $6 for a refill. Third, I felt rushed. There was no breathing room between courses. I finally told our server to give me a break before dessert. If I'm paying so much, then I should be given the chance to sit and enjoy it. 

It's expensive. For two people, with tax and tip it came to $350. Given the location and decor, this place has great potential. The service and presentation were great. But they need to work on the above.
