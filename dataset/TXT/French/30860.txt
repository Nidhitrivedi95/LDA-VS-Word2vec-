fyJAqmweGm8VXnpU4CWGNw Saw this on the way home this morning from running errands. There is a starbucks across the street I was going to stop in at but decided to check this out. 
So glad I did.  From the sign, I didnt know if it was just a grocery store or restaurant.
It is kind of both!  
French pastries, desserts, wine, beer, cheese and coffee!
Chocolate croissant was fabulous! Fabulous and fresh!
They have eclairs, opera cake, flourless chocolate cakes, 
Lunch was starting at 11.  I wanted to try the garlic pumpkin soup but it was 1050 am and they apparently werent ready for lunch.  
Great wine collection to pick from as well.  Tables to sit down, counter service to go.
Just a cute little spot to start your morning off!
It's located next to mucho macho taco and shares a parking lot right in front.
