1idRJwqXxxmgSyQRKag4KQ Outstanding. Delicious. Superlative. Intimate. Romantic. I love love this place. Go for every birthday, anniversary or any reason at all and you will find much to celebrate. 

I go often and eat well and am treated like an old friend even by new staff who don't know me. They are all well versed in the menu, knowledgeable about wine and passionate about the experience the customer will have.

All menu items come in a small and a large size so you can really tailor to suit your appetite. 

Due to the tiny size of this gem they can only take reservation for parties of 4.
