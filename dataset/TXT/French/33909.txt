hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA Made our first visit here after we did a Yelp review for sandwiches. Turned out to be a great call!

I got the turkey sandwich, better half ordered the chicken sandwich and both were very good. All sorts of other items on the menu - everything (seemed to be) organic, natural, real.

Olivier welcomed us and ran us through the menu and how the place runs. He was both helpful and very friendly. Heard him mentioning a lemon tart to another group who was in there and we ended up having to get one on the way out. Definitely do, it was outstanding!
