uP3H5bcsiTXM0k0xQhRndg Came here at 11:30am on a Tuesday and we were seated immediately. We got the Mac and cheese, grilled cheese sandwich, soup of the day (split pea and other veggies) and pasta of the day (spaghetti pomodoro). The highlights Are the Mac and cheese (very truffly), grilled cheese sandwich and the homemade breads that came with our soup and salad. The pasta was bland. Service was good and very friendly.
