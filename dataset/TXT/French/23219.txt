C3PVq7UpeHd6nz1_e-AtkA I'm such a fan! This place never disappoints!

For starters it's lovely inside and out - In the winter it is perfectly festive and warm... in the summer their patio is covered by shade trees... this is the place to go to celebrate, or take a date or take your mom...all in all it's charming.

The menu is a little odd but consistently good. Pizzas, "scrolls", dips all served on crepe-like naan breads.
