ovtlrcsVRlgZZQUlHs_ovw We had a great experience here celebrating our parents 40th anniversary. They have packages you can have preset up for special occasions and we had a nice table setup with flowers which is a very nice touch. Everything was delicious, our server was very attentive and we felt very welcome by the whole staff. My parents live in the area and will definitely be back!
