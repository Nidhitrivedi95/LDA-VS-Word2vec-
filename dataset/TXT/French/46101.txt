MxHZ5XwIQWnJFTw9gZxAIg We came here last time we were in Edinburgh, and remembered the lovely food we had and so when we saw they had some lunch deals we decided to pop in again. 

I like that it's a little dark inside, and there are candles out even during the daytime, one of the only problems I have here is the stale bread they give you before the meal! why!? but the food is lovely! I had tagliatelle with aubergines and it was very good the one concern I did have was that it was a little oily. My boyfriend had the Salmon which was a little on the small side but fine for lunch I suppose. 

The dessert choices were read out to us which was a little awkward because the waiter just kept listing things and then I forgot what he said, so you just go with what sticks really and so I had a sticky toffee pudding which was also really good! 

It cost us around £20 for 2 courses each and drinks which really isn't bad!
