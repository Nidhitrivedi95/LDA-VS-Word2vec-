SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA Been to this restaurant many times, most recently this week.  As usual as good as it gets in the Cleve.  Was eating a late lunch by myself and felt very welcomed.  Hostess and waiter very courteous.

Bread and olive oil given as usual.  Ordered chicken liver and fois gras mousseline to start, came out quickly with the usual accouterments.  Rich and savoray as usual, and pickles were good on the side.  For lunch, ordered the Croque monsieur.  Sandwich was a bit soggier than I was expecting, but otherwise very tasty.  The waiter did actually ask if I wanted the bechamel sauce on the side, but it really was very good the way it came.

Anyway, just had a quick stop-in to get lunch, and food and service were top notch as usual.  I have always preferred to dinner to lunch at L'albatros, but its hard for me to NOT eat here.
