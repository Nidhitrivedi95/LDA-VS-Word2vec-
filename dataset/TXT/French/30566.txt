The simple layout that lodges itself right on the border of chic and homey creates a vibe that just makes you want to slow down and enjoy your surroundings and the company of people around you. Coupled with food that is light and carefree but with substance at the same time, Lawrence is a winning combination.

Upon entering the packed place, I was actually seated at the bar quite quickly to my surprise. After scanning the menu, I opted to order a scrambled eggs with smoked salmon and a cappuccino for my drink. The cappuccino was divine and possibly one of the best I've ever had; it was so smooth and warm and went down my throat with utmost ease. The scrambled eggs came served on a bed of toast with the smoked salmon on the side. Although I was a bit skeptical of how runny they were, being used to having my eggs at least somewhat cooked, they were perfectly seasoned and soaked the bread with their peppery goodness, and the melange of flavors I experienced when pairing everything with the salmon was unbelievably good.

Still having room in my stomach, I then ordered the mini donuts, which came with one of each filling - chocolate, lemon curd, and custard. They arrived in their simplistic beauty, just dusted in powdered sugar like it's no big deal, and trust me, they do not skimp on the filling. My favorite one was probably the lemon curd - it was not too sweet and was just right in terms of tartness and citrus flavor. The custard donut was pure in every way possible, and the chocolate one was chock-full of runny, liquid-y cacao - it did burst and cause a mess on one of my hands though.

Overall, I would say that Lawrence is a wonderful place to go to for brunch, and I also checked out their lunch and dinner menus; they both looked amazing and innovative as well. I'll be sure to come back during those times to check out their other menu items!
