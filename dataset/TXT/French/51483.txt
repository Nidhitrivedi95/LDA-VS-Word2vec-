pfg6zkYnNvFM7Tr1TLzBvA Edinburgh needs more genuinely local eateries.  Bijou is a small but friendly cafe off Leith Links.  Been around for a few years now and has continued to evolve through a change in management.  Good quality basic menu (most dishes in 3 sizes) with some good specials.  I like the friendly feel that welcomes you for a coffee or for food.  Kids welcome too.
