mVZoin0a8uTZgLsgJ9iNDQ Move over the Witchery, this place is definitely one of the best restaurants in Edinburgh. And unlike the Witchery, it a) actually deserves that title and b) hasn't awarded it to itself.

I'd walked past it for years, before I ever worked out where it was - the only thing you see from Victoria Street is a tiny little painted sign on the wall and a small menu by the door. That sums this place up all over - it's amazing without needing to shout about it. It's always busy because of word-of-mouth, but it's never absolutely packed like the 'it' restaurants where people book a table just to be able to say they've eaten there.

The food is loosely-speaking Scottish and French, but it's a bit quirkier than the sorts of dishes you'd expect to find - they serve things like Hare, Wild Boar and Ox Tongue. 

I have to say, their evening menu is more than a little bit pricey. Main courses are £15-£25 each, so by the time you have 3 courses and factor in wine and coffee you're looking at quite a hefty bill. The lunch menu, on the other hand, is an absolute steal. No matter what people say, you've got to love the Recession for all the high quality yet affordable set-price menus that the restaurants have had to introduce as a result. The Grain Store is no exception - you can get 3 courses for £14.95, or if you're not feeling that peckish then 2 courses are only £12.95, and the dishes are pretty much exactly the same things you can get from their á la carte selection.

I'm going back here for dinner in a few weeks, and I can't wait.
