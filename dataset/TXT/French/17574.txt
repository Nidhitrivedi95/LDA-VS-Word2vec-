9ot8oInkYZTt6wkkGe__vQ Beautiful restaurant, but a bit of an awkward location (right beside a temple and office building). Overall, exquisite and authentic French cuisine with extremely rich flavours and a well thought out menu. The basement-esque feel wasn't my favourite, but the patio area is to die for. The servers were really kind, and eager to please. I had to request a more serrated knife for my duck, which was very tough. It was my birthday and they didn't charge us for wine! Really great. Definitely ehx-pen-seeeve. But worth while if you're a lover of fine French dining.
