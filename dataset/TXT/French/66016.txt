udFcIcbWbxrO8uLF95WnQg Came in with my girlfriend after a concert and sat at the bar for a late dinner. L'Albatros is one of my favorite restaurants in town so I was naturally very excited to try Cowell & Hubbard for the first time. Unfortunately, my enthusiasm quickly waned as the service was ATROCIOUS. I had to flag down one of the bartenders (who were much more interested in getting a jump start on their closing duties) and ask for -literally- (yes, correct use) everything: "Excuse me, could we see menus?"; "Excuse me, we'd like to order wine," "Sir, we'd like to order our entrees," "Miss, could we please have some of the bread and olive oil you just served the couple sitting next to us?"; "Sir, could we please have two waters?"; "Miss, please bring back our water glasses, we weren't through." I think you get the point, and that was all BEFORE our entrees even came out! It was exhausting!

The menu was what I've come to expect from Zack Bruell - nothing too adventurous but several very good options. Unfortunately my girlfriend's scallops came out COLD, like 'we didn't even bother putting these under a heatlamp' cold, and no one on staff stopped by to check on us or seemed to care. I paid (after flagging someone down for the check, naturally), left a bad tip, and bounced. I'd like to give this place a 1.5/5 based on the food, but I can't. Maybe have the staff from L'Albatros venture downtown and do some training.

Oh! And I heard someone at the bar requesting the "Actor's Menu" - WTF? You are on Euclid Avenue in Cleveland, Ohio, NOT Broadway in NYC, homie. Yikes.
