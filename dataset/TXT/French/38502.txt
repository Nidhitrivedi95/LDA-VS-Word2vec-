JJ1Ruu37kn66YSWUmCKNCw I found this place on yelp, so it's possible I was colored by previous reviews. That said I found the decor pleasant, the service impeccable, and food delicious. Went with a group of 6, ordered 5 different pasta dishes, nobody was dissapointed. A much better value than any place else I saw on Crescent, and you'll save on wine too.
