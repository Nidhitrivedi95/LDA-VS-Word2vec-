d482l58ho0_IMdFkXX1F5Q Couldn't wait for Daniel Boulud to open a restaurant in vegas again and I got to say I was impressed. The staff was friendly and our server was highly versed in the menu as we asked a lot of questions and she knew everything. My favorite course of the night was the escargot with spetzel. The ambiance of the restaurant was amazing as well. If your looking for great food and a pleasant staff check this place out. You won't be disappointed.
