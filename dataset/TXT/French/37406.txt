j0baDQfMAGDm_QGdFMmb-Q The owner is extremely rude and yelled at my wife and kids as they were leaving Goldie's next door saying they were being too loud.  I've seen him him complain several other times about kids being in that shopping center.  I will never eat at Voila because of the owner's poor behavior and the way he treated my wife and kids.
