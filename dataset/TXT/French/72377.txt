XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q This was our first time dining a michelin star rated restaurant.

Everything from begining (limo ride) to end (dessert cart) was fantastic.

The bread cart was amazing.  Unfortunately they only heat up your first serving of bread.

The dish that blew me away was the king crab royale.  It was light yet so flavorful.  Definitely the best dish I had during my stay in vegas.

The service here was top notch.
I had to deduct a star due to several things.  The initial waiter asked us if we would like sparkling or still water and white or rose champagne.  Me thinking that since I was going to be paying a pretty big tab here, they were going to provide complimentary "premium water" and glass of champagne with our meal.  I should have known better that it was vegas.  The other was the veal.  I was expecting melt in your mouth tender but recieved a slight tough cut.  The meat itself wasn't bad, just wished they would have given me a steak knife for it.

Overall a very nice experience.  I still think about the king crab dish.  Returning to vegas in 2 weeks so I may stop by or try L'atelier next door.
