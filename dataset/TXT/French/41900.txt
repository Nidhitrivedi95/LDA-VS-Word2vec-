Kut9tVbDX_f7qKMRRoXg3w One of the best experiences I've had in the Old Port area. 5 adults, 2 kids, and a stroller. They gladly squeezed us in with the brunch packed Sunday crowd.  Every one of our dishes was perfect and my friends are food snobs so that says a lot!  The fondue came with a massive meat plate, the onion soup was arguably the best ever, and to top it off they have their spin on the NYC invention, the Cronut. 

Our server was cheerful, helpful, and always arrived at the right moment. The vibe in this place will leave you smiling and tapping your toes along with their funny assortment of music. 

This place is the opposite of most of the "stuffy" or "touristy" feeling places I've visited in this part of town.
