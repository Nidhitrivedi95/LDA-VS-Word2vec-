1aj4TG0eFq6NaPBKk6bK7Q I am giving a three star review because of the great atmosphere and mediocre food. 

Today I ate a quick lunch at Jacques Cafe well on break from work. When I first walked in I was greeted by a nice young man with a big smile. Yet the place is inviting and has a rustic feel, it can be misleading on the fact of I wasn't sure if it was a seat yourself or a chipotle style order upfront type place. Once I ordered and got my food I noticed I got regular fries instead of the sweet potato fries I ordered. Also the sandwich was a bit dry and could use a little more sweet and salty factor to it. The bread was to hard and a little low on protein if you know what in saying. 

If you want a great environment with decent food and shy service this is your place, Jacques!
