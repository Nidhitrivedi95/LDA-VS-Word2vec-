6fPQJq4f_yiq1NHn0fd11Q What does an early-bird bahelorette do when she's been up since 7am and is patiently waitng for the girls to get ready? Food run. We were stayin at Paris, and having only had a few hours off my feet after strutting around Vegas in 4.5 inchers til 4 - I wanted close and quick.

I ordered the Forestiere and added meat - it was good. The bechamel was better the other day than this morning. I also ordered the Du Soliel and the Berry one. I advise you to go when no one is in line - our crepes came out crisp and were filling and delicious.
