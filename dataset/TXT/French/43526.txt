lzwNoKVBC5eJe87151tPSA I met Kristin S. at 98 South last night for drinks and appetizers. What a cute little place! I don't venture down to Chandler too often, but I will in the future for 98 South. The inside is really nice and modern.  I'm a sucker for dimly lit restaurants.  I arrived before Kristin, so I got the only seat left at the bar and ordered a drink while I waited.  The bartenders were very friendly and not pushy at all.  Once Kristin arrived, we got a table in the main dining room area.  Even though I didn't do it, I like how you can create your own wine flight.  

We had the cheese plate which was a nice size for $11.  We got french bread, apples, olives, and 5 cheeses. All 5 cheeses were delicious...I think it's the first cheese plate I have ordered out here in the Valley where I loved every cheese. There is usually one cheese that I don't like, but not here. Normally, I'm not a fan of cheddar cheese on cheese plates, but the German cheddar on the 98 South cheese plate was really good and didn't taste like conventional cheddar.  I also tried the crabcake appetizer for $10.  On the plate was two crabcakes...unfortunately they were not that good.  I don't like crispy breading on my crabcakes and I hate filler!!! There was no lump crabmeat in these crabcakes and they were very dry and bland.  The breading and filler was about 95% of the crabcakes with what I guess I could call crabmeat making up the other 5%. I may be being generous with that crabmeat percentage in fact.

I liked 98 South, even though the crabcakes are gross and the wine selection was a tad lacking.  I will still go back and try other stuff on the menu as the overall menu looked pretty good.
