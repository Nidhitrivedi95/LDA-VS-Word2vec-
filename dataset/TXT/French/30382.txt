FUX9h1a37GJn9ge1baiNuw Whenever I am craving chocolate, which happens a lot, I stop in here and get a Chocolate Tart. YUM!! I've tried a few of the breads, the names of which escape me now but they were all great! I haven't tried many of the other pastries- every time I go in I think 'try something new' but then I see the Chocolate Tart and I just can't resist, its just too perfectly chocolaty!
