4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw WINNING! That's what Mon Ami Gabi did for my gal pal and I this past weekend. The view and our service were all top notch. The butter merlot filet was excellent...cooked perfectly and was ever so juicy and delicious. The house pinot complimented the filet perfectly (like Charlie Sheen and cocaine). The warm flourless chocolate cake was scrumptious and the perfect way to end our dinner...and start the night. Viva Las Vegas baby, yeah!
