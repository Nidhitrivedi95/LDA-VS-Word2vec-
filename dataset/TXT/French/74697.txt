xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g Beautiful view, comfortable seating, excellent food, good service. We decided last minute to try this place and I'm glad we did! The view is gorgeous with a perfect view of the bellagio fountains. We only had lunch, but I bet at dinner time, it's an amazing view.

- Cream of Mushroom Soup: creamy, smooth, perfect balanced flavor
- Foie Gras wrapped in Duck Prosciutto with Fig Compote: mouthwatering, delicious, very smooth, melts in your mouth 
- Moroccan Lamb Burger: flavorful, huge portion, chips okay
- Seafood Salad: simple, refreshing, variety of seafood
- Petit Fours: nice, light, sweet ending to a nice meal

Service was okay at first and the server warmed up to us at the end of the meal after he found out we were from San Francisco. He was, nonetheless, very attentive and polite throughout the meal. It was a very nice, relaxing lunch on our last day in Vegas despite an obnoxious French family that made a big fuss about seating arrangements. Overall, great food, service, and the view is gorgeous!
