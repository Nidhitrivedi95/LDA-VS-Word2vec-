Sr-DO1Nt8X4I4Pjxapwz-g I ate here with a small group of ladies on November 10, the second day the new patio of Bistro and Batten first opened. While we have truly loved the atmosphere at their prior location adjacent to this one (Bistro ala Mode) this venue is also lovely. (The indoor restaurant was preparing for their grand opening which I imagine went smoothly.) It's so nice to go to a restaurant that's not located in a strip mall or shopping center. It was very quiet and relaxed. Beautifully furnished and planned. The food is the same as before--excellent. Everything we ordered was delicious. And we once again were welcomed and served by the endearing and excellent Tricia. She's top-notch!!
