4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw This is one of the most amazing French food experiences I have ever had. It definitely bought me into a little nostalgia of being in France. I wish i knew our server's name, but he was number 13 and was an excellent waiter. He was constantly checking on us and making sure everything was okay, he also have really nice blue eyes and was very charming. :D 

He hooked my friends and I up with the breakfast menu since it was near the end of breakfast/beginning of lunch. 

We were given fresh baguettes and they were still warm with butter! :) YUM! 

I ordered the country style pâté ($9.95) for an appetizer, which was pretty damn good. :)

My friends ordered the Three Eggs and Corned Beef Hash & Poached Eggs. It looked really damn good and they were very good portions especially since it was about $9.95-10.95. 

I got the Steak Frites with Red Wine sauce. The FLAVOR WAS AMAZING and the Steak was perfectly cooked to the way I wanted it. Truly a symphony of flavor for sure. 

The next time I go to Vegas, I am definitely stopping by Mon Ami Gabi first, it would be the perfect way to start vegas for anyone that loves good food and French cuisine! Bon appetit!

Je reviendrai ici la prochaine fois! :D
