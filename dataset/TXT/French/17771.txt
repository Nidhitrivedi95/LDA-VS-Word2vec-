9ot8oInkYZTt6wkkGe__vQ Came here for Summerlicious lunch and it didn't disappoint.  For a mere $25 a head for the  it was very worth every penny.  Service was amazing as the server was friendly and honest about his recommendations.  They gave us some bread to start off and we got the Mojito which was not bad.

I got the Mediterranean Sea bass and it was done perfectly.  It was so tasty and the fish was not dry at all.  Portion is on the smaller size but that is what you expect from the upscale places.  My gf got the lamb susage which she didn't like that much but I foudn it to be not bad as well.

Auberge Du Pommier has an amazing atmosphere and the decor is just lovely. They have an amazing outdoor patio as well too bad the hostesses never asked if we wanted to sit outside.  The service is what puts this place above the rest, the server was attentive and friendly.  My gf ordered the cheese platter for dessert and didn't like it one bit, the server saw and without asking he told us he will bring out the ice cream sandwich for her as well.  So we ended up trying all 3 dessert on the Summerlicious menu.  

The only problem I got was the washroom, how I should have paid attention during french class all those years in school.  Took me an extra minute to find out which one to go into as there was no picture and the words were in French.  I had to read the words out a few times like a little kid. Thank goodness no one saw. haha
