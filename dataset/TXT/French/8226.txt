4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Seating was great...al fresco, but close enough to patio door A/C to be cool & comfortable for an early dinner.  Food was fantastic, as usual.  Seared salmon, hanger steak, chicken were all excellent with none left for "take away."  Server was very knowledgable, courteous & engaging.  Great experience for us (as returning patrons) and first time guests!
