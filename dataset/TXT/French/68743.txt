vna49NPM-7B11tcFPTgnsg Incredible. Amazing. Absolutely recommended. 

We rolled in early and without a reservation -- luckily we were offered a spot on stools near the front. Any later we probably wouldn't have been so lucky. 

Another point of luck was that there was an English menu available, which proved highly useful given some of the unusual ingredients present in the menu.

We formulated a plan that of course included a small charcuterie plate for the two of us, and three dishes after that which sounded good. But we decided to ask our server's recommendation (our server was terrific, btw, so we absolutely trusted him), which changed our order completely (except for the charcuterie, which is a must.) We ended up going with the Braised Onion with Mackerel, the Veal Tataki with Sweetbread (would NEVER have ordered this on our own) and the smoked duck.  All were spectacular.  Truly! And affordable! 

We didn't try any wine as we were on a bit of a beer bar tour and felt it necessary to stay with beer to preserve our well-being.
