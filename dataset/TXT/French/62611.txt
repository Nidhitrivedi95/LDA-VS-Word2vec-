SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ I LOVE House of Tricks. 

I've been here a few times and always enjoy the ambiance, food, drinks, and staff. 

House of Tricks is all outdoor seating, so probably not best to come here on a hot 100 degree day (they close down in July). But when the weather is right and you want to enjoy AZ's beautiful outdoors, this is a great place to sit for a while with good company. 

I came here the day before Memorial Day with two of my girlfriends. We split 3 appetizers (Mussels in a curry chorizo sauce with bread, fruit and cheese platter, and baby back ribs). We all had a few cocktails, too. I recommend the Pear cocktail (Grey Goose Pear Vodka, champagne - delicious! but one or two of those and you might want a ride home). My friend had the Spring Chicken cocktail (gin, peach schnapps - very refreshing!)

This is the type of place where you can really sit and enjoy your meal and drinks for a couple hours. There are trees surrounding the tables and bar so there's always shade. Even though it's by ASU, you feel really closed off and private. 

The Executive Chef here is amazing, as well! We met him last time we were here and had to give him props for everything he makes. He completely changes the menu EVERY SEASON so you'll never get bored of this place. I have never tried anything of his that didn't put me in a blissful food coma. 

Keep doing what you're doing, guys! Love everything.
