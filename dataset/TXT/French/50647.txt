OYHpqY6-3C-wXR-uPbHhwA Was in a cupcake kinda mood so I found this place on yelp! Stopped In and bought 6 cupcakes for my family and I........ 
$17 for 6 cupcakes!! It's a little outrageous to pay that much, but they were delicious!  The menu looks amazing and can't wait to try more!! I wish they did some sort of discount or package price if you buy 6/12 cupcakes. All the bakery items looked Fabulous!!
