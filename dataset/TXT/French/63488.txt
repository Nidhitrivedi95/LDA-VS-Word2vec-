t1mR_Zff6Dqv1TueE2JLEA We  came for a friend's bridal shower.
This might be a good place for a party like our as we could watch belly dancing and even participate.
The ambiance is nice and it's cozy, but too cozy for me, to the point where i felt a little claustrophobic.
Our party was big and I have to compliment the server who managed to serve fast and haven't confused any bills and orders.
I wasn't impressed with the food - it looked nicer than it tasted. Everything was too salty, which was really unnecessary as the dishes are very flavorful and have the character. The prices for the main dish are between $18 and $30.
Overall it was a good experience, but I probably won't come again.
