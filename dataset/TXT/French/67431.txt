UWupVhvb1qWZh8rNowJliQ Went here for Valentine's Day and was really impressed! I had the organic beet salad to start, which was made with a variety of types and textures of beets with feta cheese - it was a nice twist on the old, overdone beet salad. He had the charcuterie board and really enjoyed it as well... until I told him he was eating fatty duck liver, that is. After that revelation he avoided the foie gras. Good thing I didn't tell him what the head cheese really was! 

For our entrees I had the pickerel with wild rice risotto and kale. The flavours were fantastic! I really liked the addition of plump dried fruit to the plate. He had the chicken cordon bleu and gave it rave reviews. 

The maple sugar pie with nutmeg ice cream was easily the best part of the meal - we demolished it in less than 2 minutes! The cinnamon sugar donuts with chocolate dipping sauce paled in comparison, but were still good.

Also of note is the restaurant's decor, which consists of wood floors, exposed brick walls, and chic black and white accents. It gives it a moody but relaxed atmosphere - perfect for a special date night!
