ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug After waiting in line to eat here just as we arrived in Vegas, I was pissed that we didn't seek out a Denny's instead. BLAH food, BLAH service and it's kind of pricey as well. I know that everything in Vegas is expensive but -- $9 chicken fingers that come with nothing but ranch and 2 sticks of celery that tasted that they came from a frozen box from Costo, puh-lease!
