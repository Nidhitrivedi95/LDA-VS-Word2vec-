4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw This used to be one of my favorite restaurants for years! Definitely the best french cuisine in Las Vegas but the service is not all there anymore. The hostesses are VERY rude like they are angry to be at work and when we decided to speak to a manager about it he blew us off and was very, very rude to us, kind of like we were bothering him. Don't get me wrong, to date it is my favorite french restaurant in LV but maybe a refresher in customer service would be nice.
