4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Decided to have a nice solo breakfast one morning. Walked over to Mon Ami and was seated at their outside balcony facing bellagio's fountain. Waitress recommended their special. Eggs Benedict on top of pork tenderloin covered with a roasted tomato hollandaise sauce. Absolutely delicious! Freshly squeezed OJ and two cups of freshly brewed coffee! Great way to start off the day! Love this place.
