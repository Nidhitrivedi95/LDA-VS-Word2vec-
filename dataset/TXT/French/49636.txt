or4UVDjXEEjze3wNPjoAZA Disappointing!
The worst Lemon Drop ever $12.
The CHICKEN @ $26 was mushy, potatoes and celery were mushy. 
The Beignets were also "way" mushy in the middle almost wet, ick!
The chocolate leather around the "tiny" cheesecake was weird as in chocolate aspic with no flavor.
The French atmosphere was very nice except for the Eiffel Tour in the middle of the restaurant lit up like a Christmas tree!
To be fair, the sauces were very yummy.
