AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw Hands down get the buffet if you are there for brunch.

All you can eat bagels, lox, cream cheese, capers, pastries, fruit, yogurt

Fresh squeezed orange juice (5* just for this), coffee

$22 is a steal, esp for vegas rates!

The bathrooms are outside of the restaurant next to the hotel buffet, so they kinda stink :(
