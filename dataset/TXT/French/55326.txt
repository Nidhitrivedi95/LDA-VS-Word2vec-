rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A This was my second time eating at Bouchon. My prior visit was a year ago & a positive food experience (had the saffron mussels and have been hunting down a bowl that can compare to this one) 

Glad to report that the quality of food is as expected with Thomas Keller's name attached to the place. This is a beautiful space that make you feel like you are in a bistro in Paris (with a lot of personal space). We had the chocolate beignets to start which were delicious with the raspberry & nutella that they were served with. Almost too large a portion and we had to waste one in order to not fill up.  

I had the shrimp & grits topped with runny over easy eggs. This was a very comforting & hearty dish. My girlfriend had the boudin blanc, which has a soft texture and delicate flavor. 

The only downside was that after prompt initial service, our waiter was no where to be found after our food arrived. They forgot our order of frites (which are some of the best I have had, as per my last visit,) and i was not able to request some from our waiter. Quite disappointing as the frites were one of my main reasons for coming back :(  

The downturn in service put a slight damper on things. However, the food is excellent and this place is a must for anyone who loves French food. Memories of trips to France are definitely going to be rekindled in terms of food!
