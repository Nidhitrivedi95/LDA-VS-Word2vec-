jLxeBgWhLRbII2ACkgH1Sg If you're on a diet This place is not for you. However if you aren't this place is heaven to you. I got the chocolate croissant and the martnmonte crepe. Both were well above my expectations. I've had a similar French bakery in LA and the chocolate croissant beat the one in LA. I love butter and you can taste the butter on Both the crepe and croissant. The crepe was more of a lunch thing even tho I came for breakfast. It was still an delicious experience.  They are both made to perfection. Additionally the interior is like walking into Europe, makes you forget you're in Vegas. 

It's a must have if you like sweets and are in Vegas. Definitely going to be coming back 
On my annual trips to the strip.
