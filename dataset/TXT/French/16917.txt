8xCiibfgqy-8xpCWEaguqg We visited on a lovely night and sat outside in the heated terrace. The menu was fantastic. Great starters, amazing entrees and a great list of drinks. They didn't have many beers though which was odd with keg in their name. I got a delicious peach sangria. Yum. Our waiter was really nice and helpful. My friend tried the pistachio salmon while I ordered the prime rib. Unfortunately, they were out of this so it took a bit longer to put in another order as Danny was super busy (and chatting up a table with two cute girls all night long) so it took longer than we'd like for him to return each time we needed something. He did recommend something called baseball steak and it was very similar to prime rib and oh so tender. The asiago rice was also delicious with mushrooms, onions and chunks of cheese. Prices were really good for the quality. The terrace was nice, although a bit hot with the heating lamps nearby, and noise level was perfect. It was crowded but we never really heard nearby tables. They even took off our drinks because the prime rib was not in stock. Nice gesture! It'd be a perfect five but it took so long to put in the new order, get our bill, pay our bill and we could see the waiter really chatting up a table right behind us and not paying attention to other tables so I have to subtract a star for that. We'd go back when in the area again and definitely recommend the food!
