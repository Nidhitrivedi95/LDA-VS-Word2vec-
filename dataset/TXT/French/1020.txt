_cjPEH9wXhKS-HQe_U3M4Q Went here for brunch over Thanksgiving long weekend. The food was delicious! For my starter, I had the French Onion Soup that is arguably the best in Toronto. A perfect balance of melted cheese, onions, broth and small pieces of toast. 

For my entree I had a medium rare (only way to do it) tenderloin topped with a fried egg and surrounded by perfectly seasoned frites. Would not change a thing about what was in front of me. Frites were crispy on the outside but soft on the inside and the tenderloin was simply mouth watering. I'd love to know where they get their meat from. 

Our only problem with the meal was the terrible server! She had ZERO patience, wasn't warm or friendly at all. We all agreed that she didn't crack a single smile. Also our plates, cups, mugs etc. were never cleared until we paid and were on our way out. I hope she was just hungover!!!
