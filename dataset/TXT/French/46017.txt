mVZoin0a8uTZgLsgJ9iNDQ Aside from the Goats cheese salad which Im told was delicious by both of its tasters..
Oysters were out, so I instead got the gazpacho. 
It came in a mini jar looking more like a pretty sauce.  With it, a few lumps of sun dried tomatoes, a kick of raw tomato puree and strong tang.  Reminiscent of the vinegary kick in hot sauce, it was not so remarkable.  

My second appetiser was the smoked salmon with fennel.  Beautiful for both the eyes and palate, it was conjured up flawlessly.  Its every part was delicate & worked.  

Three of us got the Duck confit and I have to say it was incredibly disappointing.  It was as if the chef forgot he already seasoned the meat and gave it another dose..maybe a triple.  It really ruined the dish which resulted in my nit picking at the beans on the side. The consensus at our table was that we should have gone for something else.  The server approached us too late and we couldn't mention the state of our dish for it to be worth the wait.  After a break into our first few bites, we pecked here and there and left it to be.  We were ready to leave.

I was told risotto was very good, but then risotto is usually pretty good and hard to really mess up.  I have to be honest and say I'm very disappointed with what we experienced.  At 5quid for half a pint of your average beer, you'd expect the food to be something worth it.  But the mains went so wrong its hard to be forgiving.  Three for the good first dish, charm and friendly owner.  Hope I can muster enough courage to give it another go.
