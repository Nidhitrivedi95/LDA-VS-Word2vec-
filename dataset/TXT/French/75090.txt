XZ7eQLjyGXf6y69UT4SGhg C'est magnifique! I had the spinach mushroom quiche with a side salad and Macchiato...Oh la la! I've been to many French cafes in town and this by far is the best quiche I've had!  Of course, couldn't resist la patisserie to go. The Apple pie, cinnamon roll, almond croissant and pain au chocolat? Omgggg Divine. I want it all!

Finally got to try a can of La Colombo cold pressed vanilla Draft latte. Didn't realize it was lactose free. Now I want a case of it. I'm a coffee 'snob', so seeing The Gibraltar and Cortado on the cafe menu made this place extra special. Had the Gibraltar to go last time I was here. When I ordered my Macchiato the other week, the nice gentleman kindly noted how he makes it, the traditional way. I said perfect, I don't like coffee at Starbucks. lol 

Dine in or take out, Online orders available for delivery or pick up too. There goes my diet!
