rrfe1RPh6t3QG7BRghzjYA What a delightful addition to Charlotte! Our two favorite restaurants in town are French - so we were anxious to compare this new entry- and we were not disappointed. Aix en Provence is a very strong competitor and a genuine gift of Continental taste.
First, the location is ideal for the neighborhood and the size is perfect for intimacy. The small, tasteful layout and simple decor helps focus on classic dining and enjoyment of company. We intend to use this restaurant for dates and special occasions with out of town guests. Fine dining without pretensions.
Second, service is par excellent and professional. Again, tasteful presentations without trying too hard. The management and staff know what they're doing and they do it very well.
Third, the cuisine is exceptional. Don't be discouraged with a small bill of fare- the opportunities to experience authentic Southern French dishes expertly prepared abound. Our evening included the Steak and Cassoulet entrees - both out of this world. The quality and precision of both dishes cannot be underrated. The kitchen is highly commendable. For desert- the citron tarte is highly recommended. 
Only one suggestion is- perhaps the addition of an aioli dish (only because we have enjoyed this many times in travels through Provence). 
Aix en Provence demonstrates the best of French haute cuisine and we can't wait to return.
