pRlO48w4GkWEPEYIH2tHsw I did a work catering order a couple of months ago with this Mimi's and had such a great experience the hubby and I decided to try it for breakfast a couple of weeks ago! 

What a difference a couple of years makes!  

Everything was fresh and delicious with friendly service throughout.  I love their egg white omelettes!  Bloody Mary was very tasty too!  We will be back very soon!
