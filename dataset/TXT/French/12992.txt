4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Mon Ami Gabi for breakfast. This is a winner!  We had breakfast here 3 times during our recent trip to Las Vegas. The Steel Cut Oatmeal is a huge portion that is served with sweet raisins. Absolutely wonderful! The Date Glazed Thick Cut Bacon leaves you looking forward to the next visit. We drove down from our hotel at the MGM GRAND to have our breakfast. Once again, Mon Ami Gabi delivers a fantastic dining experience.!!!
