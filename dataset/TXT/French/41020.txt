kcF-en40P3J9L8nLy5lKqQ Had you not known that this used to be Zen 32, you'd have no idea.  I have been back several times now waiting and hoping that all of the kinks would be worked out.  For HH's stick with the outside patios, the interior really is not equipped to deal with a group of folks (they'll kindly put you at a long table to try to accommodate, but it doesn't really work).  The food is well....okay.  I love the fact that they are open late.  (Midnight and ten p.m. on Sunday)  The HH specials are decent,  but nothing on the food menu really pops.  The ingredients are fresh, but the execution lacks enthusiasm.  Example:  Huge shrimp, cooked to the point of being beyond rubbery but actually tasteless in the cioppino.  
The interior is exposed brick, casual meets upscale.  (I'm not sure that is a word but think exposed brick with fancy pendant lights).  They might be going after the same market as Hillstone, but the food isn't quite as reliable or steakhouse accessible.  The staff is friendly and tries hard.  (One knock, being charged 2.95 cents for soda water)  Overall, I prefer the drink experience to the dinner experience.  I'm still waiting for the food to catch up to the surroundings.
