*Great wine selection, and reasonably priced.  They offer some unique wines, along with daily specials and don't have the 100%+ mark-up of most restaurants.  (Making dinner for two - appetizer/salad, and pasta, entree and a bottle of wine around $75.00 plus tip.)  So an affordable, nice "date night".
*very good food - particularly their specialties - i.e. Chicken parm is one of the BEST.  We also like the beef Carpaccio with Arugula; I saw some negative comments about it below, but my husband is a CIA trained Chef and rates this one pretty high.  Pasta dishes have always been very good.
So why 4 Stars and not 5?  Service.  While bar service is only good when management is present.  If not - you have to ask/remind the server for everything - from bread, to utensils, etc.  They never give you clean utensils for the next course, etc.  If you are going to serve the full menu at the bar, make sure your servers are trained.
