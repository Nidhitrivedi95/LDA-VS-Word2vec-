YUFxSG6idHePsxOmnSHtpQ We came back here after living out of state a few years. Food is horrible! It used to be our favorite place. Menu completely different, over priced, and just awful. My chicken and guac sandwich came out freezing and, instead of guac i got two floppy black avocado slices that i couldn't even cut through. The pancakes for my kids were hard and chewy and the waiter gave my son the wrong order. The waiter was very nice and apologized but there was virtually nobody there snd it took about an hr for our food. Never coming back again. If it wasnt for the waiter being so nice we would have bounced mid meal.
