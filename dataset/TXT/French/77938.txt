YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g The service here was friendly and the staff was knowledgeable but slow. Overall the food was just okay. I was expecting much better. The "in the shower" mac & cheese was not all that impressive, I was expecting it to be great considering that he won a challenge on Top Chef with it, but it was pretty boring. Also had a steak that was a bit overcooked. Overall my experience was just so so.
