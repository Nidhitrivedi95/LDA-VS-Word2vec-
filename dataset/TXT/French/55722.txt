rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A First of all, I think I ordered all the wrong things (based on the server's recommendations).  I was thinking about steak frites.  Instead, I got a special appetizer that was short ribs with foie gras and a red wine reduction.  It wasn't what it sounded like.  It was a tiny rectangle wherein the short ribs were chopped into the smallest possible pieces, topped by foie and then topped with a jelly that was the red wine.  It was like a mini layer cake about the size of a Twix.  It was also cold.  The texture was unnerving.  I couldn't get past it.  The flavors - if they melted all into your mouth - were good.  But I could not get past that weird jelly texture.  Blech.  Then I got the gnocchi because the server told me that they were pasta - not potato - and they were not.  The only way to even sort of describe them is that maybe someone took something light and fluffy like mashed potatoes, squirted them out of something and into a pan and browned them slightly.  So strange and not even good tasting.  Herby.  They were sauteed with spinach, goat cheese, olives and purple carrots.  Nearly flavorless.  I took two bites and left it sit.  Not one person asked why I wasn't or didn't eat my dinner.  No one asked if we liked anything.  My husband had a big steak that was delicious.  Our friend had the leg of lamb and it also was delicious.  Stick to meat people.  I think they do it well.  Oh and dessert too.  Yum.  Those chocolate bouchon are AMAZING.
