mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q SOLO DINERS, REJOICE!

Are you (or will you be) alone in Vegas and wish you had someone to share that gourmet tasting experience with, but not ready to call an escort service?

L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon in the MGM Grand is a wonderful answer. This exceptional restaurant is designed for interaction with the chef and his kitchen and serving staff as they perform culinary magic in their beautiful open kitchen, as well as with fellow diners seated at the counter.

Whether you choose one of the tasting menus or pick and choose from the a la carte offerings, the offerings are extraordinary, adventuresome and delectable, each dish presented as artfully as it has been prepared. For me, last night's Lobster Fricassee was to die for, as was my snapper starter, and all of us within earshot of each other waxed poetic over the potato accompaniment! And dessert? Simply not to be missed. The wine list also will delight solo diners, with a large offering of splits and wines by the glass.

All in all, dining to rival the best entertainment on The Strip!
