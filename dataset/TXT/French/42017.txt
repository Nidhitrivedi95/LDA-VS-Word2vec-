Kut9tVbDX_f7qKMRRoXg3w Avoid this place, it is a tourist trap par excellence. The dishes have nothing to do with what you would call french food and also lack of quality. Same goes for the house wine. The staff unapologeticall even admits that and blames it on the owner.  

Don't be fooled by the supposedly French ambience, there are plenty of good restaurants around the corner where you can eat much better for less.
