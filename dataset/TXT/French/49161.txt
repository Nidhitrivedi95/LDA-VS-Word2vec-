On Tuesday we arrived at 17h25 to be very rudely told to go away because they were not open. As you can see on the right hand column, they open at 17h30.

I'm fond of saying that good service can save bad food, but great food cannot save bad service. 

This was a case of horrible service. 

On the good side, the rudeness ended up saving us at least $150 if not more.

People who know me, know about my restaurant list (for those who don't it is available at zeke.com), needless to say Chez Delmo has been removed from it.
