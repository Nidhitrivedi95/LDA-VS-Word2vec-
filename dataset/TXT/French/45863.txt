mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q There are a couple of choices when it comes to ordering at L'Atelier; you can order a la carte, or one of their two dining menus (one is six courses for $95, the other is nine or ten for $145). We ordered both dining menus to get a taste of everything. 

The food at L'Atelier is definitely at the top of its game-- our amuse bouche was some kind of foamed foie gras. Absolutely mindblowingly ridiculous. Some of my favorite dishes were the onion tart, the mussel soup (which has no mussels at all!), the quail stuffed with foie gras, and the mashed potatoes. Like others have mentioned, the potatoes are really, really tasty. It has an almost fluffed texture-- very creamy and silky. Plus, if you get the truffle version, it's really that much better.

For the 6 course tasting menu, I had the option of trying an assortment of tarts or housemade ice cream. Of course the tarts, right?! Out comes 5 mini slices of tarts, which tasted as good as it looked! The other menu had a champagne infused coconut gelee, which had a strong champagne taste. I also ordered a raspberry mojito that was very good too.

Overall it is a must-try if you have the time and money to do so!
