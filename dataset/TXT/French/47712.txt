O3OH5IEFMPtz7mPKakPZ3Q We found this place by chance.. couldn't decide on what we wanted so we picked a random number. So happy with our pick! Owner/exec. Chef is really friendly and personable! The food was amazing! The gyoza were unlike anything we've ever had before! I think we both could have had 4 more! We will definitely be back!
