Da6eZFThE9xanUAGNpZxAg Came here Saturday evening with 3 others. We ordered 5 meats, 5 cheeses, 3 olives, 3 sharing plates (pork ribs, sweet potato bravas, and arancini), and cocktails (I had a pumpkin spice specialty cocktail). The cheese and meat board came with 4 slices of bread, a few slim pieces of toast, and some jam, Dijon, and butter. Everything was good. 

Special shout out to the pork ribs over mac and cheese, they were PHENOMENAL! The melted cheese inside the arancini were a pleasant surprise. I also loved the Rondin du Poitou goat cheese and Chorizo Iberico. 

Service was slow, our server apologized a few times about it. But the ribs over mac and cheese were so good that I don't even care. Also they do NOT ACCEPT AMEX!!
