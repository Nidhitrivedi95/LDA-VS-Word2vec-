B56AYe5GNuavMDtwFsXqzA I came here for Sunday brunch with my friends. I ordered the Quiche Maison which was the Swiss Salmon. This was sooooo good. It's very light and a good lunch size portion. The salad was good too but a bit too salty. But it's good together with the salmon. 

Our waitress, Amy, was awesome. She's very nice and informative of the menu. She came by often to check on us and to fill our waters without even asking. She also recommended various drinks besides the Mimosas . I'd recommend her if you ever come here because she's a very friendly person.

The ambiance is really nice especially on a clear cool day. We sat outside and the whole outdoor seating is surrounded by greenery and flowers. It was a bit hot outside too so they have water mists and a lot of umbrellas. 

Overall, I'd come here again. Cute place and good food.

Note: They have a deal for $35 per person with never ending Mimosas and an appetizer, entree and dessert. This is a good deal if you come here with a date or whatever but only for Sunday brunch.
