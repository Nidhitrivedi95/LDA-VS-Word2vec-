4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw The food was very good. The fries were a bit too salty though and my meat was too cooked to be called rare as I asked. Also we were in the terrace as the view is amazing facing the Bellagio. It was cold and the server didn't switch on the heater even after we asked him.
Good restaurant not to expensive !
