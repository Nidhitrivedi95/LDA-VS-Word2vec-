htQgj-ANQpZGpIpkkrEmyQ Pleasantly surprised for a Markham restaurant. I have had my fair share of chicken and waffles from Harlem Restaurant, CNE to Pickle Barrel...etc, I would have to say this was the best chicken and waffle combo yet! 

For$12, the chicken was boneless, tender and crispy which was paired perfectly with the fluffy waffles. There was a small dollop of butter and the just the right amount of syrup. 
 
I would definitely come back here.
