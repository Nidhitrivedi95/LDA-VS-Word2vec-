4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I took my aunt and uncle here while visiting vegas last week and we loved it. It's my second time here and I got the steak which was a French steak. I wasn't impressed bc I didn't know what to expect out of a French steak. I didn't realize it would be so flat so make sure you know that before hand. The soufflé cauliflower was very awesome! If it's warm air outside on the patio so you can see the fountains across the street. That might be the best part of the restaurant! Also it's not very pricy and was easy to get a reservation in even on a Friday night
