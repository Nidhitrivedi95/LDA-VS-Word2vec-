AHosGBveeXx9YjsQvdJgeg Absolutely delightful food!!! But the view is outstanding!!! Ask for a table near the windows when you make a reservation. The filet mignon for 2 is finished table side, definitely a great option for dates. The staff are amazing and Mr. Bentley is always around if you have a problem. One of my top favorites in Charlotte!!
