tCSlpwJQ4CZsUEMZeH2SFg Delicious fresh prepared food with a French flair. Walking through the door one forgets they are in a suburban strip mall surrounded by chain steak houses and the mall. Cafe Monte is as close as you can get to an authentic French cafe in the queen city. 

Our table ate:

1. Smoked ham crepes. Perfection with a generous dollop of cream.

2. Kids crepes with nutella and strawberries. Um, can't go wrong with chocolate and strawberries.

3. French country breakfast. Includes hash brown, sausage, toast, eggs. Traditional fare, but with flair.

4. Eggs benedict - this also included the hash browns and eggs were poached to perfection.

Food was delivered within 5 minutes of ordering on a busy Sunday, service was always there with water and coffee refills.

This is a gem of a brunch spot. Can't wait to try their lunch menu.
