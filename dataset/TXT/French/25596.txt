It was a Thursday night and Mix is probably one of the few dance clubs that didn't give our group of guys any grief to get in (got all of that?).  With a Mix pass, our guys paid only $10 cover, while ladies are, of course, free.  

When asking the bouncers for the lounge's specialty drink, they argued back and forth between the Melon and Apple Martini as a favorite.  I leaned towards the Apple Martini - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-zOprLTFP3JhFQemMcVWeg?select=XOkF6l81z-tuyhZUr5Rbgg, which was strong with a deliciously puckering sour apple taste.  $13 for a cocktail, which is not too bad for Vegas.  The lounge was fairly spacious size with plenty of comfy booths- all facing the glass wall with the Strip's fabulous view.  The dance floor isn't the largest, but it wasn't super packed that night - just how I like it.  Music blasted some hip hop with R&B thrown in (Biggie, J. Hudson, Diddy, etc).  I had a great time here!  Just be sure to beat the crowds swarming the elevator at around 2am, the bewitching hour when the Vegas visitors get restless for a change in clubbing scenery.
