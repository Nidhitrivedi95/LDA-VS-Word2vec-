bEVWHtBRYVwqaaNF4mWNYg Beware, if you have allergies.

If, like me, you ask careful very questions of multiple members of staff that your food order is your-allergen free, and you tell them it's an allergen, you want to trust them.

You don't want to be told three bites in that "they are sorry".

This is a dismal fail. It's also likely to completely ruin my weekend. Sorry doesn't cut it.

It'd have been nice if the original waiter would have apologized as well. He didn't bother.

To their credit they didn't bill me for potentially poisoning me. And I suppose they had the honesty to tell me - that's something.
