rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A My last meal in Vegas was at Bouchon, and the lunch was pretty good.

We showed up at 11, and practically had the whole restaurant to ourselves. The restaurant was a little hard to find (in the Venezia section of the Venetian), but the restaurant looked nice and classy. We ended up getting:

Moules frites (mussels in white wine came out in a Staub cast iron, with tons of fries): this dish was very good

Croque madame: again, this dish came with a lot of fries. Everything tastes better when you cut the yolk on the sunny-side up egg. I liked this dish more than the mussels.

Goat cheese and greens: the salad was decent, although I would have liked something crispy or crunchy to contrast the warm goat cheese or nicely-dressed greens.

Although not cheap (a little less than 80.00 including tax and tip), it was one of the best meals that I had in Vegas this past weekend.
