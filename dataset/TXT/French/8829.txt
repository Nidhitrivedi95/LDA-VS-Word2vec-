4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw On our last night in Vegas, on our 13-year-overdue honeymoon, my wife and I were taking one last stroll down the strip. We wandered into Paris Casino, feeling hungry and just looking for something different, so we tried this place. It was a very enjoyable experience. We ordered the cold seafood platter for two- lobster tails, oysters, shrimp and salmon, along with a glass of wine for each of us. The staff were very friendly despite our being obvious tourists, our server went on at length about the wine and she made sure we got just the right wine to go with our meal- she really knew her stuff! Service was very fast despite the place being packed, and the food was wonderful. The server was right on target with her wine suggestions, they were perfect with our seafood. The fresh bread and butter with the meal were a nice treat as well. They also found the perfect romantic spot for us to sit- a candle lit table for two indoors (it was rather chilly outside) with a clear view of the fountains of Bellagio across the street. Our quick stop to eat turned into a romantic candle-lit dinner, what a nice way to end our vacation. The only reason I gave this place 4 stars and not 5 was because it was rather pricey- our food, one glass of wine each and the tip came to $90. But  funny enough, I had just won $90 playing blackjack in the Mirage so I guess it was meant to be!
