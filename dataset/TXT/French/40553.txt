KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA This was our first visit and will definitely not be our last! We chose Marche Bacchus because we love French cuisine, read the reviews and snagged a 1000 point Table on OpenTable! We arrived and started exploring the wine shop. To our utter delight, we found one of our favorite Sparkling Whites (Saint-Hilaire) and ordered a bottle to have with our dessert course. Our table was perfect - outside right on the edge of the lake! Our server, Nicole, was wonderfully attentive and helpful. We started with the Escargot - delicious and garlicky! The bread was warm, crusty and served with real whipped butter. We decided to split the Summer Salad with rhubarb dressing - I loved it. Hubby thought the dressing was too sweet. I ordered the Veal Braciole and Hubby got the Red Wine Braised Beef - both delicious! I ordered a glass of Chateauneuf-du-Pape and Hubby got a Barolo - NICE!! We had a hard time deciding on entrees because there were so many things we wanted to try. For dessert, I had the Fromage (5 different selections with caramelized onions and peppers, grapes and candied walnuts - YUM!) and Hubby got the Warm Chocolate Lava Cake with Chocolate Gelato instead of Vanilla Ice Cream. The cake was not as warm as he expected but was delicious none-the-less. We loved the entire experience and will be back very soon!!
