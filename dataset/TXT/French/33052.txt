HcfwrlljJpfLh71znq47zw As I live and breathe this was probably the greatest dining experience of my life.

Other half took me on Friday night as a birthday treat, and my god a treat it was. From the moment you walk in the door you know you are somewhere special. Greeted at the door we need not even give them our name, based on the time and without any notes in site he greets us both by name....!

With no hurry given to reviewing the menu we were instead given a beetroot macaroon with horseradish cream and asked if we wish to have an aperitif. Once that had arrived and we had begun to enjoy it and relax we were then presented with the menu, expertly explained by the waiter.

For me it had to be the tasting menu, other half went for the shellfish tasting menu. We both had the wine pairing. What happened next I don't have words for:

7 courses of the most exquisite cooking I have ever had the pleasure to witness. From the amuse bouche of 3 tasters including salsify, scallop and salmon mousse, to the scallop with pigs trotter puy lentils, duck with morels, ox tongue and potato.....it just kept coming! The wine with each course seemed to get better, some how not clahing against the last.

At the end of the meal we were privileged enough to be taken on a tour of the kitchen. If this is was michelin dining is about....I want more of it.

To say this place is JD Recommended is as big an understatement as can be made! :)
