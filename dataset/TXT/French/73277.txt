Xu6mEU7IbKlWic1ETgUOeA This has always been our favorite restaurant for celebrations but we're going to have to rethink that.  This is now the 3rd time we have had either bad service or less-than-excellent food.  Nadias is not a cheap restaurant -- the two of us each had one cocktail, an appetizer and main course:  $110 before tip.  For that price I expect that my food will be top-notch and the service impeccable.  First our foie gras went to another table and sat there for quite a while before the waiter realized it had gone to the wrong table.  By the time it got to our table it was stone-cold.  We ended up sending it back to get heated back up.  Then, no soup spoon -- we had to ask for one.  Then my salad had the wrong dressing on it -- had to send that back.  On top of this we witnessed multiple f***-ups so bad that I over heard the owner/chef griping at the wait staff -- and later, the sous chef had to go to the wait staff area/garde manger kitchen to get them to pick up their dishes that had been sitting on the line.  Nadias used to have an edge but it seems to have dulled with time!
