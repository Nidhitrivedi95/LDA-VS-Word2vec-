EEIz44ewHhOKmfTloAK13g TBH it's a little over-rated but the food is good quality. I don't find the menu comes together as well as prix fixe served elsewhere. Our server was wonderful, he was clearly experienced, as was the sommelier, but some of the other younger staff came across as snooty and unapproachable.
I felt the presentation of napkins and selection process a bit unnecessary, along with the magazine it was borderline pretentious.
