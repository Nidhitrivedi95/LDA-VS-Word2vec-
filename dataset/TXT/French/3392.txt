1fFRUk4ZmGIInV9IH3tFxw The food here is French cuisine, nothing truly inspired but nicely done and well presented. The decor is interesting with salvaged tables and chairs that in some ways are in keeping with the food, but in other ways seem a little too hippyish. The owner however is an anxious type and her customer service leaves much to be desired. Several good wines are offered by the glass, which is nice, and prices are reasonable.
