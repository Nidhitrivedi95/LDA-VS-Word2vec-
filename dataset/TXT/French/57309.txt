rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I finally had a chance to check out Bouchon for brunch when I was in town NYE weekend. We got there just in time before brunch was over and only waited about 15 minutes. Service was a bit slow, but I'm thinking it's because it was a busy weekend and it was nearing the end time for brunch. Not a big deal. Everything on the menu sounded soo good and I was hungry! Soo I plan on trying it again and getting something different next time!

Anyway, they bring complimentary bread out with butter and a cherry jelly. I heart bread and butter so that was already a pretty good start. I ordered the Bouchon French Toast and my husband got the Croque Madame (because all the other tables around us had fries and he wanted to see what all that was about!). My french toast was small, dainty, and very beautifullly plated. It was tasty and I enjoyed it, however it comes out soaked in the maple syrup and there weren't enough slivers of the apple. Overall, it was good, but just a tad too sweet for me. My husband's croque madame was very good! And so were the fries. :) I wish I could have tried other things like the special appetizer of the day and the doughnuts, but we were full and I really wanted to get stuff from the bakery. =)
