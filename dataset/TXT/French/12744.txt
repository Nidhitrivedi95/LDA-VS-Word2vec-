4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw With all the great restaurants in Las Vegas, it is hard to narrow down a favorites list.  Our list has about ten names on it, and Mon Ami Gabi is one of them.  Every dish we have tried over several visits has been excellent.  On our most recent visit I ordered my favorite dinner - French Onion Soup and bone-in rib eye steak.  This being my favorite dinner, I have a lot of other restaurants to compare, and Mon Ami is as good as it gets.  The French Onion Soup is at least tied for the best in town - lots of well-melted Gruyere cheese and a broth that is rich and seasoned just right.  The steak was delicious - tender, tasty, properly cooked, and without the excess of fat and gristle that  is sometimes present in the cap of even in the highest quality rib eye.  The last two steakhouse rib eyes I have eaten were not as good, and both of them cost over $60 compared to $41 at Mon Ami.

Mon Ami is one of the most popular restaurants in town.  I have heard that it claims to be THE most popular, and perhaps it is.  So make a reservation, or go early, or be prepared to wait.  Be prepared to wait an especially long time if you want to sit on the patio (which you do, trust me) overlooking the Strip and the Bellagio Fountains across the street.  No reservations allowed for the patio, though.
