T4g4k2OhCTsiqcP-ZXElHQ Have you ever hesitantly decided to try a restaurant and an hour or so later you felt sorry that you made that decision ? Well I exactly had this feeling. The French onion soup was so greasy that it was impossible to taste the soup. Just an inch of grease on top. The stake tartar was  just ok. But the made from frozen fries just made the dish not ok. The desert was nice and freshly made and that is the only reason I give 2 stars instead of one.
