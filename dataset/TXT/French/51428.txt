P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ We went there for my birthday this year.  It was awesome! I went with their pre-fixe menu.  I didn't feel like having the meat dish they had on the menu, so I asked them if they could change with their truffle dish. They were very accomadating.  It was truffle season and I really appreciated having their trouffle with lentils than the ordinary steak.  The presentation is awesome and everything tasted really good. oh! They also provided a complimentary birthday cake - a whole birthday cake. It was so big that we ended up taking the cake and petit fours home.  :)
