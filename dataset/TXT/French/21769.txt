Bf-yMQiSmDZyqfGyFKQ0bA I recently moved to the Waterfront and had driven past Blue Dust numerous times before finally stopping in on a Sunday afternoon. Since then, I have been to Blue Dust on three occasions now and am very impressed.  This restaurant combines reasonably priced food, great craft beer selection, and a friendly atmosphere. Oh and let's not forget the unbelievable Bloody Mary's with your choice of dill or horseradish infused vodka. 

I have had the pulled pork tacos and the beef brisket.  Both were excellent and cooked to perfection.  The meat was tender and flavorful with reasonable portions at a good price. The service is always very friendly and timely. This is a great spot to take a date or just a place to stop in for a pint of your favorite craft beer after work.
