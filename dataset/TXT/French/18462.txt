A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g oh my macaroon! I've never been that big of a fan because I've only had the kind that tasted grainy, too sweet and didn't taste the featured  flavor.

But here the macaroons are slightly larger, more delicate and airy, and oh so flavorful. I tried a couple... Just to taste, and my favorite one is the rose. It's a seasonal flavor ow but I hope they add to their regular offerings.

In addition! There's a new quiche in town. The crust is flaky, the egg filling is soft and creamy. I've had the mushroom goat cheese, vegetables, and mushroom, and onion, all were great. You won't go wrong with any of them.
