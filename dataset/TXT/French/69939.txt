WOj8nPos3R9IIf0Pyttd8g 5 stars for service and the Green Eggs and Ham Frittata.  I just don't know how they make their frittata taste so darn good.  A frittata isn't a normal food that you would crave right? Wrong as soon as you eat your first frittata at Lulu's you will not be able to get it out of your mind.  Did I mention it's the size of a pizza I always eat 1/2 and bring the rest home where I dream about it until I can eat it again.  It's seriously that good.  The servers are always friendly and accomadating even when they are slammed I love that!
