mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q The food & service did not disappoint. Matthew are waiter was great, my glass of water was never below half empty. Enjoyed the foie gras amuse bouche it was superb. We ordered foie gras with cherries, yellow tail hamachi with sea urchin , and what we came specifically for the langoustines. Finished off with a salted caramel drink.
