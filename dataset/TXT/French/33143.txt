HHvO4MgBFabsmlInou6viQ Came here with a group of 8 with a reservation on a Friday night and the place was filled. For large parties you have to pick from a prix menu, we had 3 options of an app, entree and dessert to choose from and everyone can get a different option. 

I started with a salad, simple but fine. For the entree I got a seafood stew and wow! it was amazing! it was a mix of fish, mussels, some clams and shrimp a good mix and portion of seafood and topped with dried slivers of green onions. The fish was a little overcooked though but the broth was amazing! it was creamy and buttery, really savory and satisfying. It was actually also very filling. 

For dessert I got the upside down apple tart - the apples were deeply caramelized with lots of chewy bits and extremely extremely sweet but so delicious. The pastry at the bottom was a bit chewy, but it comes really warm and the portion is huge! Plenty to split between two people if not for the prix fix. I was so full by the end I couldn't finish the tart and I had to roll myself out

With a glass of wine the total came to be about $50. However when billing it seems they have charged us more than expected and we couldn't figure out for what. Some people ended up paying $70-80 which left a sour taste in our mouths after a delicious meal.
