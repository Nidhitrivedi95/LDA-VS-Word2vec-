0d6kx6Jlocw77y1J9nbqMA A lazy Thursday and a few episodes of Cake Boss brought my friend and I to Scratch. The restauraunt is very cozy and outside seating is available although the atmosphere isn't quite the same with metal patio furniture and a view of the bike racks and parking lot. The menu isn't amazing, but it's the ingredients that are used (i.e. amazing french bread fro sandwivhes!) However, it is the pastries that take 1st place here. You must try the cheesecakes, and for $.75 you can take the cute little cup with you =)
