mVZoin0a8uTZgLsgJ9iNDQ 4.5* really...

Set on the first floor over a number of shops on Victoria Street, the Grain Store's atmosphere with its many small rooms and authentic decoration sets it apart from the beginning. With friendly and welcoming staff, the intimate setting works very well indeed.

The food here is very good. Extremely good, in fact. I think I was spoiled a little by having eaten at Wedgwood the previous evening, which set the bar very high indeed... and between the two, I think I would still prefer Wedgwood. That said, the quality of the meal was highly impressive, with the locally-sourced ingredients being a major plus. However, given the relatively small portions -- notwithstanding the high quality, the portion control was a little too far towards "nouveau-cuisine" for my liking -- it's on the pricey side of expensive.

This was a very enjoyable evening, and if you want a romantic dinner with a loved one, I'm not sure anywhere else in Edinburgh can beat the combination of ambiance and great food. Purely on the basis of price and food quality though, there are certainly alternatives which give the Grain Store a run for its money.
