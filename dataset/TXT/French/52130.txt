This place seems to be under the radar but always amazes me and anyone else who goes there.  The ambiance is very intimate and makes it hard to believe you are in the suburbs of Charlotte - it feels like you are in another country or a "big city."   
My husband and I took another couple who had never been and they are particular about their dining experiences.  We all had an amazing experience.  The service was great and even though they were very busy our server, Hope, was very attentive and helped us with our various menu questions.  I can't stop raving about the Cabbage Salad with Pears and Goat Cheese.  Doesn't sound great on paper but it was delicious.  (Side note: after my experience I have been searching Pinterest to find a recipe like it so I can recreate it).  I ordered the special of Amber Jack fish with Polenta and finished off with the flourless chocolate cake dessert.  It was the perfect meal.  Everyone else had ordered other items and all were loved.  Will definitely be going back!
