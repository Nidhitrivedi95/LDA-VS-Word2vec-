uP3H5bcsiTXM0k0xQhRndg Robin square was an all around great experience! Had to wait a bit but the staff was super friendly and made the wait totally bearable. Menu is not extensive but what they did have was incredible. Had the Incredible Mac & cheese (which was incredible)- the portion was very generous and reasonably priced. My boyfriend had the pizza, which wasn't very big and a little pricey for the size but it was delicious and the imported cream filled mozzarella was a huge highlight so no complaints! Quaint decor and cozy atmosphere, warm and welcoming staff with elevated comfort food- highly recommend!!!
