Ok so I love the French but I usually don't do french because moi= vegetarian. I am not sure if this place is really considered french but the menu sure seemed like it to me. 
French Onion soup........done as well as it can be done. Perfect blend of onions and cheese....the best I've had in awhile. I will go back just to have it and to lick every spoonful of cheese off my spoon ever so seductively. 
Wine list= fabulous. 
Scallops= hmmmm I can't really remember because of that great wine I had which I forgot what it was called because I drank too much of it. But they were really good in some sort of lemon-y sauce. 
I loved the art for sale on the walls. I think because of all the wine I drank I almost bought the naked women tile on the back wall. Today I am glad I didn't buy it because it would clash with my decor. 
The only negative thing I have to say is that the table's kinda reminded me of a grandma's table.... could use some updating. The lovely art I thought did clash with the grandma's tables. 
Besides that... J'adore!!
