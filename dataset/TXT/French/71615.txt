XcWlBj5oQgzKhR7Cxovj3w Pricy but what you can expect for an airport, right? Food was good. Shared a chicken pesto sandwich on fresh baguette which came with fries lightly dusted in smoked paprika & salt around $18. Side of a nice spicy mayo & an interesting "ketchup" salsa. Decent pinot $11 for a 5oz. Service was quick, and our server (whatever his name was) was attentive.
