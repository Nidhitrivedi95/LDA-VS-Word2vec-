I, however, wanted a salmon burger. Hear me out: 'twas fantastic. The patty itself was incredibly tender and m-word (say "voiced" but replace "v" with "m"... god, I hate that word) and paired flawlessly with the coriander sauce and coconut cream that accompanied it. I'd definitely rank it in my top 10 anything-but-ham-burger list. 

But, the surprising aspects of Scratch don't stop there. They offer a completely vegan cheese burger topped with mushrooms, cucumbers, avocado, peppers and tahini, as well as vegan soups and salads. A butter-and-eggs bakery, doling out vegan entrees? Oh no they didn't (but actually they did) and you can color me impressed. Now, if only my sorry excuse for a wallet could handle the admiration I have for your food...

I didn't buy from the pastry window, but I inquired about nutritional information, to which they replied, "We don't have it listed... probably because it's really bad for you, honestly (chuckle.)" And you know what? That's the best damn answer I've ever gotten from a dessert counter. Thank you for your salmon patties, your vegan food, and your honesty, Scratch.
