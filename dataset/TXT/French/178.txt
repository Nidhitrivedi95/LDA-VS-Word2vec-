-4TMQnQJW1yd6NqGRDvAeA Went for our anniversary dinner. We didn't have a reservation, but we must have gone at the right time as we were seated immediately. Reading some other reviews and tips, this sounds pretty freakn rare. 

Ended up getting the Aged Goats cheese plate, wild sea bass, duck bolognese, and brussel sprouts.

The aged goat cheese plate was really good. I am not a fan of blue cheese, but that whole element of the aged goat cheese was not overpowering. It was a perfect balance. Really enjoyed it, more than i thought i would (my wife prefers it thats why we ordered it). The sea bass itself was just okay, The skin could have been crispier, but the plate as a whole was delicious. There were so many elements on the plate, that when eaten together, it elevated the plate a lot. The kimchee they used on the plate was really tame for kimchee, but it had the perfect elements needed to enhance this sea bass. The duck was rich, I enjoyed it. I wish there was more duck in there, or larger chunks instead of shredded. It was my wife's plate, so the few bites I had I enjoyed, the creaminess of the marscapone, with the pasta really balanced out the richness of duck.

Brussel sprouts were well cooked, but a little heavy handed on the salt, for our preference. 

The service was great, and they brought us out some champagne and a deconstructed cheesecake, which was a great way to end the meal.

We'd come back and definitely try something different on the menu, not necessarily cause we were unhappy, but because everything sounded delicious (and some other dishes at the tables around us looked tasty)
