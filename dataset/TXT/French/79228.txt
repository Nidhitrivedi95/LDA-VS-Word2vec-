ZdaZwXC0FByDY3EwNELphw I wish I could give Union more stars. The truth is the food was amazing, but the overall experience was less than satisfactory. 

There are too many tables in this small space. I was practically on top of the person sitting at the table beside me and could hear their conversation so clearly, I felt like I was eavesdropping. At one point it was hard to even be in the room, my thoughts drowned out by the roar and echoes of ambient chatter. What I'm saying is: it's extremely loud at Union on a Saturday night. Go there for the food, not the atmosphere. 

The service was decent, with servers racing around, squeezing through tiny crevices between tables.

But as I said, the food was amazing for the most part. 

We had: 

Elk sliders - 5/5 tender and juicy and delicious. Try this!

The pear appetizer (can't think of exact name) - 3/5  I was surprised that this was cold. Also it said it came with sunchokes but I saw no sunchokes in mine. The blend of flavours was nice when I took a bite with the right amount of pear and cheese, but it was nothing special.  

The steak hache - 5/5 this was delicious! I don't know what they seasoned it with but it was perfection. Just the right amount of sweet with the meat.

Swordfish - 4/5 slightly bland but still good.

For dessert we had cheesecake with salted caramel- 3/5 there was too much caramel on the plate and the caramel was a bit over salted for my taste. 

I don't know if I would return to Union because of the noise level and how cramped it was. If this restaurant was in a larger space, or took out 3 tables I would be back in a heartbeat!
