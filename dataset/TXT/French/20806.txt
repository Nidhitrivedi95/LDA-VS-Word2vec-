AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw Payard is part bakery/part bistro tucked away from the action of the casino floor at Caesars Palace. This is where we had a relaxing dinner (wow, we could actually hear each other talk!) before we partied it up bachelorette style at PURE nightclub.

Service was great from start to finish and our server even offered to take our photos multiple times.  Obviously,  the stars of the show are the decadent desserts (crepes, lemon tart, Louvre were all outstanding!) Don't dismiss the simple, French fare which are all executed well. You can't go wrong with the seared scallops appetizer or the creamy lobster bisque. I loved their caesar salad with real anchovies and soft poached egg. My friends loved their fish of the day and the short ribs were fall off the bone delicious!  Although my NY strip steak was a bit overcooked and bland, the crispy frites saved the day.

Payard offers one of the few best remaining deals on the strip in Vegas, ($48 for 3 course prix fixe dinner!) I will definitely come back next time.
