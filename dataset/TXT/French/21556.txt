bEVWHtBRYVwqaaNF4mWNYg Went to la coquine for a team lunch on a Friday afternoon. It was a suggestion from someone who lives in the area. It was busy for the lunch session, so I suggest making reservations especially if you're a group.

A work mate and I decided to split two items the croque monsieur and the poutine with had duck confit. 
The croque monsieur was make on a thick slices of bread, the outside toasted to a little crunch while the inside was soft and melted. It was very cheesey with not much ham, so good think I love cheese. It came with a side of salad (or fries) for $12. The poutine was delicious! The fries are cooked in duck fat, its mixes with duck confit and mix with two cheeses, brie and another I can't remember. There wasn't alot of meat in it but the pieces were crispy and tastey $15.

All in all the lunch was good. The waiters were really nice and attentive and the food came out quickly. 

I'd good for the dinner menu to see if I really like to this as I'm just on the edge. I hope to really appreciate the food and the decor at night when there's is a different crowd and atmosphere.
