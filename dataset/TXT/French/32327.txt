gxMa7j1LXIUxxBoP0osDpA Fabulous brunch spot with local organic fare, done with artistry and care. We started with the beet salad and a side of the O'Thym smoked trout...which we ate before I remembered to photograph. Fresh juice of the moment: red & yellow beet with pear, excellent coffee. Our party of four ordered: the Vegthali with quinoa porridge, Wellington Beef of chopped Wagyu & chorizo - or as we thought, "pain au chocolate but with a delicious meat filling..." Yum!, grilled cheese with curds -wow!, grilled flank with sweet patatas bravas and Guinea fowl egg -awesome! The steak was perfectly heated until it tasted good.
Next time we will bring our own wine/cava to mix with the fresh squeezed OJ!
