4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I love this place so much!!!! From the food, to the decor, to the service and the ambiance. I come from a francophone background, so France and french food is very familiar to me.  I have to say I feel like I am back in France here:) 

I came here last week for lunch without a reservation, they seated me outside at a table  with a beautiful view of the strip and the bellagio fountains. 

Right away, I was greeted with a hot and fresh baguette and butter. I proceeded to have the chicken mushroom crepe in Brie, and it was SO GOOD! I was so happy. Pick this is if you're looking something not too crazy but utterly divine. 

My waiter was this sweet guy from the Midwest ( I forgot his name, but I remember him being from Missouri) and he checked on me every 5 minutes. He was awesome! 

This is a must in Vegas!!! Please stop here if you want to people watch, enjoy the views of the strip and have great food!
