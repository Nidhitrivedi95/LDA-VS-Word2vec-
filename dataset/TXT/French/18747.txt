AHosGBveeXx9YjsQvdJgeg This place is wonderful!!! It has become a regular. 

Table 10 has the best view in the place!! I primarily make reservations at this table! Jason has been our server each time, and has done an excellent job ! He is very pleasant and helpful in finding foods we would enjoy. 

BEFORE DINNER..
·Complementary Roll- They serve either a white or wheat fresh warm roll. I don't care for the butter, a butter, honey, garlic mixture. Instead I order regular butter. 

·Salads - Cesar Salad - ok
             - Romaine & buffalo mozzarella - ok. 
                The cheese was the best part
Dressing... They only have 2 primary choices
·Cesar- not very good
·Champagne vinaigrette - too acidic the first time, but loved it the second time. 
·Oil & Vinegar - oil was so so

·Gin-a-tonic with Hendrick-just right the first time! Very good! They were out of my primary drink this this evening. 

DINNERS..
·Cheddar Mashed Potatoes, Zucchini, Squash & Green beans- Delicious!!!!
......The potatoes were just perfect & nice and creamy! The zucchini was grilled but you really couldn't taste anything charred. The Green beans were crisp with just the right amount of parsley. 

·Bourbon flamed Filet w/ Twice baked potato and carrots- Amazing! My friend loved it!! 
.......My friend thought the filet was very good, but the Bourbon flavor was a little overwhelming.  

·Veal with guda mashed potatoes- my friend said the mashed potatoes were the best part of her meal. 

DESSERT..
·Mango, raspberry, & lemon sorbet that came with strawberries and blueberries- Incredible!!!!

· Creme Brulee- Excellent!! Really nice, served complementary for my friend's birthday.
