jalA5zHW8ZfY3RSPG7oDxQ Twas on the south side to run errands at lunch yesterday and thought I would try this place out.

3.5 stars.  A nice reprieve amidst crappy Pittsburgh fall weather, I chose the small table by itself in the back facing the patio.  Service was friendly although again there was only one for the whole place and she was quite busy.

I had the sundried tomato mozz sandwich with genoa salami.  came with a lovely pasta salad on top of a crisp piece of romaine.  the sandwich itself was well assembled and tasty, but wasn't fully heated and the middle was lukewarm to cold.  given the texture of the sandwich this was a bit of a turnoff.  give me a cold or hot sandwich but not in between.  on second thought I should have just sent it back to be broiled longer but I was hungry and am fairly non-confrontational by nature.

anyhow, at $7 it was a good deal.  I will definitely be back and hope to be able to re-rate at 4 or 5 stars.
