dW9cPsvOGwlOpiz3wEBgiQ Nice little French place in the Lake Las Vegas Village.

Dropped in for dinner while staying at Ravella.  It's a small, cute restaurant with nice stall and tasty food.  They were very good our daughters, checked in regularly with us to ensure were were enjoying our meal, and the execution on our dishes was great.

The French Onion Soup is sweeter than what else I've experienced, but they make it work.  The Tartine I had and fish dish my wife had were both very enjoyable.
