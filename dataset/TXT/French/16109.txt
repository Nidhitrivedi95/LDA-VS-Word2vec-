78TC3sZSYBzBsSJ0z5pyhw We first tried Le Provencal about 5 years ago, and we really enjoyed it that's why we decided to have dinner there last week.  

While we were looking at the menu, I noticed that the menu had more Italian food on there than French.  So I asked the waitress about this and she indicated they had to tailor it for the customers, and that Provence was close to Italy.  Okay people....go to an Italian restaurant then!!

We had the Caesar salad to start, and the dressing was really good. We decided to order the Bouillabaisse for 2. The presentation was impressive being served in a very large cauldron, but the shell fish was small and the fish was tough.  

The service was nothing to brag about, because she had to wait on so many tables.

The kitchen was quite loud, and you could hear things being dropped.

We will not be going back.
