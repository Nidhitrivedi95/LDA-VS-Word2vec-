0d6kx6Jlocw77y1J9nbqMA The Scottsdale location is closed, people.  The "letter," on the windpw (from the property owner) states they are locked out for being in arrears.  This is an old story of expansion, draining operating capital and something having to give.  Unfortuately, for those of us in the "hood, it's the Scottsdale location.

It does seem that the owners were not paying enough attention.  This was so apparent in the lack of training, for the front-of-the-house staff.  Several of them were oblivious to the tried and true standard "FIRST you wait on the customers."  Notice I made that plural, as it does not mean spending all one's time with "a" customer and leaving others unattended.

They will still be missed, though.  The young lady chef, on evening duty is (was) fabulous.  The scallops were the best I've ever had - and that includes both coasts.  The breakfast sandwich was another sure-fire winner.  The food really has never been the problem.  It's been the down-hill course of the wait staff, which used to be exemplary.
