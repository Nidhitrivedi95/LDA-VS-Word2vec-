atNpoWy_XrhT9EUIEP6azg I slept in today and worked up an appetite doing some shopping and socializing at the Old Town Farmers Market.  It was after 12 noon when I realized I was starving since I hadn't eaten breakfast.  (I realize this may be normal for some, but this is rare for me - I eat breakfast every day!)

Jared and I wanted to stay in the area and we finally agreed to head over to Metro.  We had Minnie with us, so we planned on sitting outside.  Unfortunately, despite having a patio, Metro does not allow dogs.  

We ended up having Minnie sit right outside the barrier to the patio while we sat at the table right inside the barrier and we took turns going out to keep her company.  Needless to say, this was not the most relaxing brunch, but we were starving and didn't want to head elsewhere!

Jared had the oatmeal and I had the egg white omelette with cheese grits and wheat toast.  I'm still a fan of the breakfast/brunch at Metro more than lunch or dinner... The service was alright; not overly friendly... and it must've been Bill's day off because we didn't see him either.  Bummer!

Bottom line: Metro is a great spot for breakfast in my opinion... but unfortunately, they are not dog-friendly!
