78TC3sZSYBzBsSJ0z5pyhw After a long day of walking the Vegas strip on 05/17/13 I told my wife that I was in the mood for some italian (Particularly some pasta because I didn't have any in a long time).

I decided we should try this place out for dinner since this was located right in our hotel.

Upon arriving we were greeted by the hostess and seated immediately. We looked over the menu as we sat and waited for our server to come to take our order. The server arrives after about 10-15 minutes and takes our drink order. After 5 minutes or so another employee brings out our drinks. By this time we are ready to order but our server has disappeared.

Finally after about another 10-15 minutes our server arrives and finally takes our order. My wife ordered the Creamy Chicken Penne with Pesto and I ordered the Spaghetti Carbonara. When the meals arrived we started eating within a few moments my wife and I began looking at each other like we had telekineses. Both understanding from our facial expressions that neither of our pastas were awesome.

After a few moments of reading each other's mind we asked each other how did we like our respective meal. My wife went first and said her pasta and the chicken was bland and only had flavor because of the pesto. I too told her that my pasta was bland and I even forgot that my dish even came with bacon because it was buried at the bottom of the dish. Sigh.

I feel that because this is an italian restaurant they should have executed the pasta meals flawlessly in taste. They did fine in presentation but not so much with the actual taste.

I mean the food wasn't nasty but it wasn't mind blowing either. If you come to this place you may want to try something else on the menu because the pasta wasn't anything special.
