QEgfK_TKY8bwK-YzKDdkGw Lumiere has some of the best service and food in Charlotte. Lisa is definitely one of the nicest, most knowledgeable servers around. The specials they run each week are very appetizing, and although they may look small in size when first brought to the table, they're rich and filling. The last Friday we were there we had the lobster/steak combo special with a glass of French wine for only $35, which was also a good value.

What sets this place apart from other fine dining places in town, aside from the awesome service, is the focus on small touches. From the nice glassware and white table cloths to the amuse-bouche (small appetizer of a cheese pastry with soup du jour), you will be sure to leave thoroughly impressed. It's hard to believe this place used to be an Einstein Bagels! The decor is comfortable, though if I was in charge of the lighting, I might turn the lumens down a bit. 

An evening at Lumiere is generally preceded by a visit to the HT wine bar (sorry Charlotte Agenda...had that idea long before you). Look forward to visiting again soon!
