Tefx_N6A6nrsdj4jHHnbYg I can not speak highly enough of this place. Everything is perfect. The sandwiches are fresh and delicious. The pastries are always warm crispy. Even the staff is willing to go out of there way to help accommodate any order. I frequent this bakery at least once a week and can not say how much I enjoy it every time.
