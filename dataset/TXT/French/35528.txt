htQgj-ANQpZGpIpkkrEmyQ Pretty interesting concept. It has the "toronto downtown" vibe we are missing in GTA. I love this! The place is cute and cozy, the server was really friendly - even though he messed up our bill.... multiple of times. But it's all good, I get it - he was prob exhausted from the weekend.

Everyone got the chicken wings waffle - personally I didn't see all the hype around it.... I find it kinda odd having waffle and chicken wings together. 

I got the pasta! A little bit small, but loved it! I would def be back to try other things on the menu. They also have a pretty good drinks menu as well - a little bit pricey in my opinion, but it was pretty damn good.... so I'll let it slide! 

Overall, good vibe, good place, amazing food. Will be back for more.
