jaSowNITPRRCYpPb3_pjdA We went for brunch today. The restaurant is lovely. It is nice and modern and the staff is friendly and very helpful. My friend and I both ordered the chicken and waffles which were outstanding. My friend's daughter ordered a French toast dish that she loved. We did have the bottomless Mimosas and they were fantastic. To start off, we got cheeseboard and it was really good. The bread that initially comes to your table that is warm, with fresh butter, was delicious.
The prices are quite reasonable which I really like. I like that he just off the strip as it was very easy to get to. It is fantastic if you live in the southwest section of the city. 
We plan on going back to try dinner as the dinner menu looks wonderful.
I have no hesitation in recommending this restaurant as we were very pleased.
