rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A My second visit here.  In the Venetian hotel but you do not need to walk through the casino.  
Probably three times the size of my familiar yountville location.
During the day the restaurant is focused on breakfast items.  For example, the omission of French onion soup at lunch is troubling.
