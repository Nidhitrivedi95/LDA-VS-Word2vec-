4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw It's one of those places that has a limited menu.  I don't like that.  I'm picky and I need variety.  Lost a star for that.  

Thursday night, no reservations but there was no wait to sit inside.  There was a 1 hour wait to sit on the patio.  Service was very friendly.  We ended up ordering the French Onion Soup, Scallops and Chicken Grandmere.  French Onion Soup was good.  Most places make theirs too salty but this is a French restaurant so they better get that right.  Scallops were average.  They were good but it wasn't anything special.  Chicken was very good.  One of the best chickens I've had in a restaurant.  A little bit pricey for a casual restaurant but then again it is on the Strip.  I didn't think the food was that special.  There are dozens of other restaurants back home in Orange County that are just as good, if not better, for the same price.
