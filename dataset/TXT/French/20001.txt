aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw I wasn't very hungry but after losing $180 at Wheel of Fortune, I needed a litto pick me up, ASAP.

Bouchon Bakery is such a gem! Everything here is just so cute and looks yummy. A little on the pricey side, but the Turkey Baguette sandwich with a chocolate eclair has got me hooked. 

I dunno what the hell is in that turkey baguette, so addicting.. They have it prepared in a glass window and once you order it they put it in a panini press-like machine to heat it up. The baguette has some leafy greens, lots of fresh turkey, a creamy/nutty/buttery cheese that is to die for, and a special spreAd that brings everything together. Also, the baguette itself is soft & crunchy with nuts baked in. Like Bobby Flay said, the best foods are the simple ones done right. 

Pricey for sure but the Turkey baguette ($9)  is heartier than it looks!
