fVF5wayDyY6ZR5oJB1IK3g Montreal does brunch right.  Every order was was beautifully presented and the flavours, perfect.  

Kidneys were cooked nicely, piled high, and very shareable.  The smoked trout with scrambled eggs were just fantastic.  Even a simple ham, cheese, and egg on bread was delicious topped with a simple rocket (arugula) salad.  The sausage and egg roll ended up being a sandwich and the sausage was full of flavour.  

Correction, Lawrence Restaurant does brunch right.  

Try and go earlier to avoid a long wait.
