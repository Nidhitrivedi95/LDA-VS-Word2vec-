This place is an extremely romantic place to have dinner! As for my case i went here with friends and it was really amazing. The seafood tower (appetizer) we ordered was amazing. The waitresses explained each seafood's origin and my goodness were they fresh!  The crab, shrimp, lobster, and oysters were just spot on! I personally also got the french onion soup and for me it was a tad salty but the taste was really good. The caramelized onions just melted in my mouth and with the sharp swiss cheese its a perfect bite. 

The main entree that i ordered was the steak and frites. Their steak options are limited which i like because id rather that restaurants be amazing at a few things than mediocre at many. The steak was grilled perfectly and seasoned nicely. The sauce that i chose to pair my steak with was a bearnaise sauce which was quite nice. 

The dessert that i got was the apple tarte tartin which was a good way to finish up a heavy meal *.* I also got a coffee to go with the apple tarte which made it even more divine. Their coffee is amazing so make sure to pair with any of their desserts because they are a bit sweet. 

The price I would say is pretty fair considering the ambiance, quantity, quality, and location. Lucky for me i did not have to pay but had i had to my bill would have been about $100. Nevertheless i would come back! It was really tasty and quality is quite amazing. Also thanks to the amazing staff here for being so friendly and helpful to us! 

Cheers!
