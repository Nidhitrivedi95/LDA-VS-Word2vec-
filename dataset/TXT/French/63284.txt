SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA I had the best birthday of my life when my husband surprised me with dinner at L'abatros with our closest friends. Neither of us had been here before, and my husband found the restaurant based on Yelp reviews and my intense love for French Cuisine. We were NOT disappointed.

To begin with, the staff was incredible. They seated our party of 10 in the back room, which was private and oh so cozy. Our bread plates and glasses were never empty, and the prompt, professional, attentive staff made for a memorable evening. 

The food was out of this world. Every single item we ordered was splendid. We ordered several of the appetizers, including the savory French Toast, pate, cheese plates, and goat cheese with sun dried tomato. Every dinner guest in our party raved about their entrees. I had the Coq o Vin, and my husband had the short ribs. I ate every bite of my meal, despite the fact that I had no room after all the bread and appetizers. It was just that good. The wine selection is extensive and the staff is very knowledgable about their wines. They helped us select several bottles, which were just wonderful.

My husband brought a cake, which they served and packed up for us when we left. I really can't say enough about every aspect of our dining experience at this quaint upscale restaurant. I can't wait to come back here to dine again.
