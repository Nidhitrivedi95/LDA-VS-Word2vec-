9ot8oInkYZTt6wkkGe__vQ I came here for Summerlicious 2015 and had a very pleasant experience. Our table of 4 never felt neglected and the service was great. 

I had the chicken terrine as an appetizer and that was the star of the meal. Truly a memorable dish as the terrine was tender but not as smooth as pate, it had a meaty consistency that simultaneously was hearty and light. I had the beef entree which I thought was also well done. My samplings of the ravioli and the fish proved that their other entrees were also well-done. 

We also splurged and decided to share a bottle of wine. My friends and I have very little wine knowledge and our server was very patient in helping us choose a wine. We settled on a reasonably priced riesling (?) which I think was called Adona from niagara. It was delish! The only takeaway of a star was due to the dessert which I found disappointing. It was called 1,000 leaves dessert...seemed like puff pastry and mousse to me, not impressed. 

The atmosphere is definitely posh, but not intimidatingly so, our server even helped me clean up a small spill I made of our bread spread haha! 

I look forward to trying this place again, perhaps for a special occasion.
