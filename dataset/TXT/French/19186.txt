aSC-WLyJptVpziJpR98Ykg Very pleased for Montreal en Lumiere

It was a perfectly pleasant meal, I ordered the wine pairing and found the selections to complement the food really great.  It was our first visit and we were very happy with our choice. Parking right out front was easy.  It is a top restaurant here in the Old Montreal and is as I would expect.  The food is turned out to a high standard, well executed, served in a timely manner, excellent judicious service.  Well-paced meal.   I would return.  The night that we visited 2/25 (Tuesday) we had guest chef Luc Vaillancourt and not Laurent Godbout.
