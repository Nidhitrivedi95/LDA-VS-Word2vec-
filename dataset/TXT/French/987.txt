_cjPEH9wXhKS-HQe_U3M4Q This is a great French resto that is not going to break your bank. I usually order the steak et frites. The creamy cheese sauces is incredible and really compliments the steak. I like my steak cooked rare to blue and these guys did a great job of ensure that my steak was cooked to my liking. The fois gras creme brulee was also incredible - if you like fois gras you should definitely try this dish. The other highlight of this restaurant is the vast wine selection. Each dish on the menu comes with a nice wine pairing recommendation. As far as ambiance goes this is a very hip place - If your looking for this place to be some kind of worm-hole portal that is going to transport you to Paris... you'll be disappointed, but if you're looking for a cool French resto in the city, that serves great French food, you'll be happy at Le Select Bistro!

PS - the patio here is really nice as well - great for brunch
