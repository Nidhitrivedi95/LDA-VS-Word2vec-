mnn--vaYHtNyBNYFYBFIog Randomly decided to come but was lucky enough to get a seat at the bar without waiting. Had the 7 course tasting menu which was absolutely amazing. I was gonna say "especially the appetizer (sry I forgot its name..)" but everything just gets better and better. The waiting time between main dishes is kinda long tho
Service was great 
10/10 would come back so I asked how often do they change the tasting menu and here's what the waiter told me: everyday. if I were to come again tmr, they'll totally change every course for me.
