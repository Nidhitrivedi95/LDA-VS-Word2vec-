QEgfK_TKY8bwK-YzKDdkGw I will add my 5 stars to the others. Truly one of the best meals and loveliest experiences we have had at a Charlotte restaurant. It was my birthday, and Lumiere really made it special. Starting with the best French 75 I've had (even though it was a new cocktail for them to make) through the amuse bouche of light and fluffy brioche rolls and a tasting of soup, to our salad and entrees of rabbit and duck, to a lovely dessert and coffee service- it was all done to perfection. Service was spectacular. Seasonal, fresh, balanced flavors with a perfect wine pairing. Jeez, I could go on, but I'll end with an urging to GO to Lumiere, particularly if you are celebrating a special event.
