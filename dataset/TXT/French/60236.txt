SBnpT6JDbah-5l_52GM5sw It's been years since the last time I went to Sardine...and I can't believe I had allowed so much time to pass. I was reminded today of their awesomeness at brunch. 

My boyfriend and I got two items and shared because that's what winners do. The best item we had was the grilled ribeye (tender and perfectly seared), which comes with poached eggs, sauted broccoli rabe, spinach, and cherry tomatoes. It's all covered in a light hollandaise with truffle oil. I ordered some pieces of baguette to soak up all of that goodness. The second, also delicious, though not quite as impressive item was the grilled pork sausage. The sausages were pretty good, though the crispy polenta-ish cake that came with it stole the show. 

Coffee was fab: smooth, rich, perfect. I had a bloody Mary which was zingy and pretty tasty, with a sweet pickle garnish. Wish I would have been given a choice of beer back (whatever light beer that comes with is just not quite my thing). 

The weather was perfect today, and so we waited for a table on the terrace. We had coffee at the bar, and it was only about 20 minutes before we were seated. Not bad for a late morning on a Sunday.
