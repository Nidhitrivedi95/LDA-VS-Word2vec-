4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I've said it before and I'll say it again... when I want a really indulgent meal, I want a good breakfast.  And this is the go to place for breakfast on The Strip.  Make a reservation because you may have to wait, especially for a seat on the outside patio.

Let's start off with talking about the location.  You get a bird's eye view of the sidewalk in front of Paris Hotel Casino.  It's great for people watching.  Then you're directly across the street from the Bellagio and they're lake with the water show and music.  You could spend your time just hanging out and watching the world go by.

The food is great.  They give you fresh bread and butter.  They have awesome Bloody Mary's to start your day off right.  I haven't had a bad meal here yet.  All of the food is top notch.
