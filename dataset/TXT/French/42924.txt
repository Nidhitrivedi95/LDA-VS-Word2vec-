LoyBOVYO5kYkse53h-B6mQ Very well executed and balanced homely food. I had pork belly starter with a parsnip purée. Which was a good and a good prelude to a very rich and tasty venison stew. The place is all about the food and the service which are both exemplary. The dining room is clean and bright but feels a bit jumbled. The only let down was the coffee. In summary, excellent value, brilliant food with a couple of small tweaks a definite 5 star. Maybe on my return visit.
