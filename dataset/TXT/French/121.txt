-4TMQnQJW1yd6NqGRDvAeA Had dinner here last Saturday. Best date of my life... From my date ( of course) to the amazing service and then... Oh yeah... The delicious food! You know you're in a neat place when there is a leg lamp on your table. Service ... Don't even want to call it that... Our newest buddy for the evening and is co hort room mate were so funny And had us in hysterics all night. The ambience ... So very nice. Hint... I just bought Ikea out of tea lights and votives so I can recreate their ambiance in my home. The food, you ask? Oh my! I had crispy short ribs with fried crab rice. My amazing date had beer marinated chicken and side of mushrooms . All insane ! Mushrooms were to die for! I'm a mushroom foodie . Try this place out. You will have a new favorite dining spot !
