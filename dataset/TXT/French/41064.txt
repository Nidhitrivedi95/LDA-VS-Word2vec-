KcW_eVY0T0NSwlbXqUrRuw We came here on our first trip to Montreal, looked it up on Yelp and thoroughly enjoyed everything! The ribs were done excellently, the lamb was pretty good, and the salmon was very tender and juicy.  Only the rice was a bit hard at times, but overal pretty good.  I think the most memorable was the owner who was quite nice to us, allowing us to sample his food and was very polite in every respect.  Highly recommend trying this place!
