rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A ONE OF THE BEST "CHICKEN AND WAFFLES" EVER! There's a reason why it's not called chicken THEN waffles, or waffles THEN chicken. At Bouchon, both harmoniously come together: the chicken is roasted instead of fried, and the waffle is made with bacon and chives; both respectively pair very well with their chasseur sauce and Tahitian vanilla butter. BRILLIANT job by Thomas Keller for his French take on this traditionally southern meal. My plate was clean!

Other items to consider are the Croquet Madame and Steak Frites. My friends loved them and highly recommend them.

If you're staying at the Venetian, it's almost mandatory for you're party to dine at Bouchon since it's just a walk down stairs. But no matter where you are staying, it's worth the cab ride or walk over. No reservations required for breakfast.

So thank you Thomas Keller for the enjoyable meal! We look forward to coming back... And hopefully get to visit in Yountville in the near future.
