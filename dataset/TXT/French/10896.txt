4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Tonight was a special night but due to the service at mon ami gabi. I came here on my 2nd anniversary and informed them at the time of reservation and time of check in. 

Our server would not serve alcohol to my other half even though 3 ids were presented. 

The appetizers we ordered were escargot and baked goat cheese which were good. 

Entrées were steak with red wine reduction and chef plate of the fish. Both were OK but for 38 dollars for the fish and 30 for the steak accompanied with bad service is not satisfying 

I was told that they do something for the anniversary over the phone and was never even told congratulations or anything. The server was barely around. 

I felt like I was over sold and under delivered by the staff making the reservation, my server was not attentive and not around as well as the fact I was not able to share a glass of wine on my anniversary because she wouldn't take any of the 3 ids provided. It started the night in bad taste and it lingered into the rest of the meal. With no sweet touch at the end or anywhere in the middle to take away the bitterness, I am sadly unsatisfied.

The service was lacking, the food was nothing to rave about and the disappointment was high on such a special day.
