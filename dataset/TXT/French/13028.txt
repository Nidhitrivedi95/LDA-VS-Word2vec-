4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw went here for brunch a couple weekends ago. initially, they had sat our group on the patio at a table that had no umbrella. REALLY? the only table outside with no umbrella in 110+ heat? we immediately asked to be moved inside. luckily, they were very nice and accommodating, they moved us right away to a table inside. 

if you're eating here you have to have their steak frites! yumm. a nice long thin cut of steak served with herb butter and crispy pomme frites. They also have other topping such as a red wine reduction with carmelized onion... or bleu cheese... droolll. 

Since it was brunch I figured I should do something... brunchy. So i also ordered the blueberry french toast. This was also amazing.. fresh blueberry on top with blueberry syrup and a generous dollup of fresh whipped cream. I didn't think it was overly sweet, but then again I was pairing it with a steak so I guess it balances out. 

The service was great. Our waiter was very attentive and extra accommodating. Everyone is very friendly. 

Quick tip: there is a dress code.. men no tanks! they do give you a plain tee to wear though if you do forget!
