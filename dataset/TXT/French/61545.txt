SJo_IjvzdRtCvZVN0cbrRQ Absolutely Fantastic Brunch!!
Came here this morning with a friend for brunch and loved it!! Great atmosphere, we sat outside on the patio to get away from the crowd inside and enjoyed the sunshine! My friend got the quiche special which was bacon and avocado and came with tomato soup and potatoes. I got the bacon and avocado croissant sandwich which was divine!! The bacon at this restaurant is phenomenal and so thick and tasty! I loved it here and will definitely come back for more tasty treats!!
