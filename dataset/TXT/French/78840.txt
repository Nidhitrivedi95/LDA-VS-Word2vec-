ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug After a morning full of sight seeing and window browsing, my family and I were ready to eat. We looked around and every food vender and restaurant had lines for days. We noticed a short line at this restaurant and decided to this would so. Turns out they hadn't opened for lunch yet but it was only a 15 minute wait, not too bad.

After being seated, we were greeted by the most cheerful waiter I have ever met. I'm 97% sure his name was Dennis. I ordered the Salmon Burger, my mom got the Foie Gras Burger, Dad and brother ordered Beef Bourguignon, other brother got Steak Frites. As we were waiting, we were given bread. It was crispy on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside, my dad liked it so much he asked for more.
I admit the wait for food was very long but rather than just being left at the table, Dennis was updating us very often and cracking jokes with us. 

I have to say that even though it's not very French, I enjoyed my salmon burger. It was tender and not the least bit dry. The dill mayo was on point. My moms Foie Gras burger was delicious, I've never thought of putting a slice of apple in a burger before but it was genius. The Beef Bourguignon was super tender and savory but my brother's Steak Frites was just alright.
The dishes that stood out the most out of this meal were my the Foie Gras Burger and the Beef Bourguignon.

All in all, if you're hungry and not picky, I suggest coming here. It's not the best place to go for French food, I mean, over half of the items are American. With decent food bit great service, I give four stars for our overall experience.
