jLxeBgWhLRbII2ACkgH1Sg I love this little French cafe! Good coffee and a great selection of pastries. 
Been here only once but they serve peet's coffee, fast reliable wifi, authentic French peeps, and I ordered a lemon raspberry cake. It was light and didn't make me feel guilty. Definitely a nice spot! Can't wait to come back again.
