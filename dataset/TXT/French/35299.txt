Ht-_i0UAq7YDBaqJwcQMdQ Very interesting menu with incredibly large selection of wines. 
I find the selection to be in the unnecessary expensive price range however can be suitable for wine connaisseur. 
Meal was very pleasant with rich flavours and various tastes but I find some flavours were too strong and unnecessary for the dishes to be tastefull. 
The ambiente is nice but very loud due to low ceiling. 
All in all,  good but not excellent. 
Food was all Luke warm.
