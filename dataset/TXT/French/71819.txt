XgkTmVrlHHO5g96AfOAfpw Highly disappointed with lunch at Le Lyonnais today. My coworkers suggested that I might be disappointed. My parting words as I left work for the restaurant were, "Who can screw up quiche?" Well, guess what, Le Lyonnaise created a bland and tasteless (goat cheese and cremini mushroom) quiche served with a big glop of (what I think was supposed to be) crème fraiche on top. The side salad was over-dressed with an unusual tasting redish dressing that made me think of watered-down ketchup. I kept asking my lunch date, "What do you think this tastes like? Is it bacon?" Her croque monsieur didn't even look appetizing...and I assume it wasn't since she only ate about three bites. Something is really amiss here; my guess is that Le Lyonnaise will be out of business before the year's end. Big Y, what's up?
