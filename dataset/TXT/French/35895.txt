hvjgF-vnPw2jyL5DBuB0qg When one moves to New York, one learns that the best establishments require no signage. It's a notion that's fueled countless "speakeasies" and secret restaurants like Chumley's, APT, Sushi Uo, Milk & Honey, the Backroom and PDT.

After a long weekend in Montreal, it seems the trend has spread.

In four days, I had more than a few excellent meals in Quebec's largest city, but the best by far was at a restaurant whose name, for its lack of  signage, we initially couldn't discern. It was only after peering into its window and engaging in haphazard conversation with an equally curious woman from Vermont that we learned the small, impossibly charming restaurant was called Garde Manger, run by Chuck Hughes, one of Montreal's best, and our new mission impossible -- the only available table was at 10:30.

Yes, 10:30. Or as non-New Yorkers call it "Almost tomorrow." While that might be a deterrent to most, to us it meant "This restaurant is awesome." So we went home, had a few drinks and came back. Starving.

The meal was more than worth the wait. My pork loin was divinity. The lobster risotto was the best I've ever had. The steak tar-tar, the daily fish, all of it, amazing. I wish I'd taken pictures.

Two days after the fact, I could sit here and wax nostalgic about the decor, the service, the quirky music or the martini that sent me over the edge. Instead, I think I'll stop wasting my time Yelping and start figuring out a way to go back and do it all again.
