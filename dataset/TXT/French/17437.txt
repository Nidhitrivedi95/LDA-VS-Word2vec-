9mG2yOnHtxVPEM1p8FqycA Figaro, how charming you are! A beautiful blend of art nouveau and deco interior design elements, you try to seem French, and you're quite good at it! You're open late and you're consistent; que demander de plus?

Croissanterie Figaro is a nice restaurant and café at the edge of Mile-End and Outermont neighborhoods. Featuring a nice terrace during the summer, I always have a preference for the old-style interior decor. 

Table service is efficient and courteous. The food is also good, affordable and consistent in quality. They have many vegetarian options and their croissants are very tasty. The coffee is okay; although it is not my favorite I'm the city, it's not bad either. Very acceptable.

What I like most about Croissanterie Figaro is that it feels like I'm stepping into France every time I go there, if only for a moment. Minus the plane ticket and the bill that comes with it.

I recommend without hesitation!
