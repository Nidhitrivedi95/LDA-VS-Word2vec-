u-SvRRAfYgpbXZRfQgcTzA This place has always been my favourite, I remember the first time I came here and it was such an experience on its own. You have gorgeous art work fun Staff & huge chalk board downstairs.

I've had times that I've come and it's been packed and only once today were we the only once but the place just opened but that's the best time.

Food came super quick and super tasty. There so many different options but a few of my favs are the seaweed salad and the shrimp with octopus balls. Can't go wrong with those 3. Great thing about this place is that it's small tapas style plates so you aren't stuck with a huge plate if you don't like it. The price is right. 

I've had ups and downs with this
Place but the past few times I've come it's been nothing but purse happiness and full belly.
