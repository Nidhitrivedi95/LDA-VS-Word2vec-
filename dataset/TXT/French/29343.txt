Oh yes, I forgot this is French right???? There were microscopic mussels in a fish stew which was incredibly average. The wine was acceptable but a tad overpriced. Wait staff was anxious and lacked a sense of timing, being somewhat over attentive. In a nutshell, the whole restaurant concept should be revisited. If it's defining itself as French, then let true French cuisine be defined throughout the menu, The fusion piece isn't working well.
