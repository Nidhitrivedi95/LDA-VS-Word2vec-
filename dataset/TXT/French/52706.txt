1) Cherry tomato salad with Chessy foam emulsion, my fiance's favorite dish, its fresh and clean, (9.5)

2) Smoked duck (smells like bacon MMmmmm) with duck confeit croquette. (9.5)

3) Froie Gras scallops with peas and ham, its partitioned by a toasted sweetened piece of bread, textures are really great, both cooked perfectly (9)

4) Arctic Char ... nothing memeroable, cooked well, flavor... forgetable. (7), nothing against the dish itself, it may be the fish, I don't know, I am not a "fish guy"

7) Lychee sorbet (8)

Service: Spot on, very attentive, even admitted that the bartender forgot to add simple syrup in my fiance's mojito.

Decor: Contemporary, Sheek, feels like a lounge, high ceilings, very comfy coushioned seats.

Price: Very reasonable for their 7 course tasting menu. 65$ I have never paid this little... 

Convience: Location is easy to get to, its 4 minutes walk from Le Westin in downtown. Opentable.com reservation made things go smoothly.
