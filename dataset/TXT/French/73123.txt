xNnZ5ksBY1gwwTV2Btb4Ag Excellent food and amazing staff. We shared a number of items 2 appetizers and 3 main dishes for 5 people. Plenty of food. The charcuterie plank was exceptional and the gnocchi and pork flank superb. No complaints and the waiter was extremely accommodating and patient with our poor French and three generations of taste Would definitely go again on another visit to Montreal.
