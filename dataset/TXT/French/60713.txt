SCklYa_jhihWAcfIn-_chg This is definitely the closest you can get to Paris without booking a flight! I had the eggs benny with peameal bacon on a croissant, and it was amazing!!!! How can I go back to regular store bought croissants when I have tasted heaven in pastry form???? Light and flaky and a perfect medium for the peameal bacon! I also had an amazing bowl of hot chocolate and took some tarts for home! Can't wait to go back already!
