58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw If there's one thing that I've noticed so far about the Old Port food scene, it's that it tends to be a 50/50 toss up between quality cuisine and overpriced tourist traps. Le Cartet fits more into the first category with a bit of the price factor of the latter. Located in a nice part of the area, it has an open and aesthetically pleasing layout to go along with the food served, a plus that never hurts.

I ordered the "Le Nordique" platter and a maple latte to go along with it. The maple latte, while it didn't have too much of a coffee taste to it, tasted delightful in regards to the quality of the maple flavoring without being overbearingly sweet. The Nordique platter consisted of a smoked salmon Eggs Benedict on a base of some type of black bread, a side salad, and some roasted potatoes. Raw onions garnished the Eggs Benedict, which I picked out since I absolutely detest them, but other than that they it was a really yummy dish. The bread base was also quite amazing and tasted more wholesome than your generic English muffin/white bread. The potatoes were perfectly crisp and seasoned so that they didn't taste bland like how potatoes often become, and the salad had a nice, light dressing to go along with it. The only issue that I had with the dish was that for $15.50, it seemed a bit pricey for how much food they gave, even though it was presented nicely. 

Le Cartet is definitely a great place if you want to enjoy a nice brunch in a chic environment. I would save it for occasions that lean more toward the special side, however, unless you have enough dough to spend on a regular basis (which as a university student I do not have, unfortunately).
