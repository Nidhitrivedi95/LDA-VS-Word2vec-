The plates come out beautifully set. It's great for every occasion, weather you are trying to impress a guest, celebrate an occasion with loved ones,  or an elegant romantic date. I wish the prices were more affordable - I usually come here when someone else is picking up the check. I recently discovered the  Menu Entracte - $20 for two appetisers and a dessert. That could be interesting to try! Dishes are not very large, but most are suitable for sharing.
