in3zjiaLpNzr9G3K35gAJQ We wanted to host our engagement dinner at the bistro but their room wasn't big enough so they let use one of Vincent's rooms with the bistro's menu.
Both of our families were very happy with our decision, we had a great time and the food was amazing as always. 
Our server was also great and he spoke like 3 different languages which was very helpful because not everybody in our families speak English.
