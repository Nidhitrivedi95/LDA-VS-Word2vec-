SJo_IjvzdRtCvZVN0cbrRQ I want to go back tomorrow morning and every day after! My mouth is salivating just thinking about the food here! 

I ordered the Croque Monsieur in which they enfold all the ingredients into one of their freshly baked croissants. Another person in my party ordered the Pumpkin French Toast (WOW!) it was not too sweet and as I took a bite said out loud, "This tastes like Thanksgiving!" The other person in my party ordered the corned beef hash. I do not like corned beef but he enjoyed every bit of it- I will trust his opinion. 

They bake all their pastries in house!

This is a MUST TRY breakfast spot!
