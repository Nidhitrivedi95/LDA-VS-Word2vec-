Small and intimate. Bright lighting and rustic, Victorian decor. Definitely fits french fusion scene.

Service:
It's funny, how the this one rude server actually yelped this place- praising it and all. Really, girl, really? Do better on your hospitality. She even took our order late. We already knew what to get while we were waiting. Besides her- the other server was sooo freakin nice! He was attentive and hospitable during our meal. Wish I gave him the tips personally. 

Food:
The crepes were on point for me. I was soo hungry for breakfast and the Bristol filled me up till dinner time. Their chai tea latte was good too but a tad bit too sweet. They could notch the sweetness down just a bit. My party also enjoyed their crepes. They gave it a 5 stars!

Unfortunately, the overall rating is average. The food is a 4 but one down for the service. Would I come back tho? Of course!
