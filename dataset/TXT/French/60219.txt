SBnpT6JDbah-5l_52GM5sw Well prepared, well executed food. Great date atmosphere. It took a while to get our drinks and our waiter seemed busy with more affluent looking customers. In the end we go back. The setting and food are too good to pass up and worth forgetting the okay service we received. I'd like to go back for happy our.
