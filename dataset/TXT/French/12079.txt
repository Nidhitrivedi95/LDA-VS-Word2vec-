4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw This restaurant is located at street level in the Paris LV Hotel and Casino.  The food in this place is really really good.  We have eaten here before on a previous trip and decided to do lunch here again on latest trip.  We ate outside on patio along the front of the building right on Las Vegas Blvd.  It was a beautiful day and our meal was excellent.  Our waiter was a little brash but other than that we will go back again next time.
