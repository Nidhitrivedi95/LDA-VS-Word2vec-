WOj8nPos3R9IIf0Pyttd8g My wife and I had a very intimate wedding with our immdediate family at St. Mary's Chapel in uptown Charlotte, and we knew we wanted to eat lunch/brunch at a restaurant in our neighborhood. We went to Lulu and immediatley knew it was the perfect spot to eat after the ceremony. 


The staff at Lulu was great and they were able to accomodate all 16 of us. Knowing that it was a special occasion they brought my wife and I glasses of champagne free of charge. 

Everyone loved the food. I didn't hear one complaint from my family, in fact they wouldn't shut up on how good the food was. In fact some of my family is going back tomorrow to eat because they loved it so much.

Lulu is classy, but also very funky as well. It fits very well in the Plaza Midwood neighborhood.

We are really glad to have this great spot in our neighborhood.

Eating at Lulu on our wedding day was the perfect fit.
