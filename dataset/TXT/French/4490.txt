When we arrived for our 8 pm reservation on a Friday evening lots of people were waiting for a table. The service was excellent. Our water glasses were always filled, more of the delicious, complimentary bread was brought to us without us having to ask and the server answered all our questions thoroughly. He was even patient with us with as we practiced our French and helped us to learn some new vocabulary. :) Also, despite the fact that it was rather busy, we were never rushed to order or to finish our meal. I ordered a glass of Reisling which was fabulous (although it's a rather small pour). We really enjoyed the complimentary bread basket. They also provide a huge jar of cornichons (pickles) and mustard. I also had the goat cheese salad which was great, featuring four large portions of goat cheese and various greens including endives. As I said above, the steak frites was excellent with hot, fresh frites and a delciously flavored steak. The portion was more than adequate. For dessert I just had a truffe maison (small chocolate truffle). It was okay but nothing to rave about. My friend had the ile flottant which she enjoyed a lot. I'd highly recommend L'express for excellent food at rather reasonable prices and good service. Note that there is not huge sign outside (just the tiles on the ground outside) so if you are approaching by car, watch carefully for the street number.
