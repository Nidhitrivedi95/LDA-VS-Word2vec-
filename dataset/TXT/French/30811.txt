fyJAqmweGm8VXnpU4CWGNw About 2 months ago they started serving dinner so if you have been here before and weren't impressed definitely go back! They have really come around. Their Beef Bourguignon is on par with the Beef Bourguignon I had in the South of France. The Crab Canapé is to die for. They have an expansive wine collection, all at super affordable pricing. I got a bottle for $13! Little tip: If you drink the wine there, there is a $10 corking fee. Ultimately, if you haven't gone, GO! If you have gone and didn't like it, try again, they've really changed, for the better!
