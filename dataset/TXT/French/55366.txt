rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I think it's the wait staff that made it a pleasurable experience.  Our waiter was soooo nice and he even surprised us with plates that were not on the menu.  He recommended a white bordeaux which is the first I've had all year...soooo tasty :D

The food was good.  I'm a sucker for steak & frites, desserts too.  

It was actually rather casual.  I felt overdressed wearing a dress, as did my hubby in the suit.
