Ht-_i0UAq7YDBaqJwcQMdQ Why this place doesn't have a Michelin star (or why there are no Michelin starred ratings in Montreal) remains a mystery to me.  

Ambiance is very warm and inviting while being private/personal at the same time.  From the street, very easy to walk by unless you know it is there.

We had the blind tasting menu, which was spectacular.  The preparation, presentation and quality of the food was among some of the best we have ever had.  Very Quebecois, with lots of foie gras and fiddlebacks (we were there end of May when they were in season).  Perfectly cooked risotto, scallops, venison, fish and the list goes on.  It is a substantial tasting menu that really blew me away.  I highly recommend it.

Sommelier did a fantastic job.

I can't wait to go back and visit my old college town and eat here again.
