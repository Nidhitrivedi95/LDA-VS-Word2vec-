4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I love the location here! right on the strip so its perfect for the day and night. And you can see the beautiful water fountain show that's right across the street. The freshly made bread was delicious! I could have a whole baguette all by myself, it was so fresh and warm. The food was good too but it was the location and bread that made this place great. Also, the prices are a little steep but not too bad
