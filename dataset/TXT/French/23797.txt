cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg We wanted to try everything on the menu but decided to go with the actual name of the restaurant so we had stuffed pig's foot with ham on top of butter mashed potatoes and sautéed mushrooms topped with a nice piece of foiegras 
Over the top? Yes! Delicious? Oh Yes! 
PS. The Bison Tamaki was to die for. Don't order the zucchini blossoms, they were just straight up greasy. I've had better.
