rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w One of the best dining experiences I've ever had. Second time I've been here and nothing to disappoint. The food is so so so delicious but for me it's the service that makes this place a "one of a kind". As a server myself, I can appreciate the amount of effort that is put in here to make your dining experience unforgettable. From the sommelier to the food to the service, if you are looking for the best of the best on the strip this is where to go.
