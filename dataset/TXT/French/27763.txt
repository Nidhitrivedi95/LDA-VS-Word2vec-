DQFuOd8tUebBAcV5iTGfDA I've come to this place a couple of times for a croissant and an espresso. The croissant was tender and flaky and the espresso was velvety. I've also bought their lemon tarts, which have an elaborate meringue topping and have exactly the right balance of zest and sweetness. I was less fortunate with their sourdough baguette, which was rock solid and dry, I can't help wondering if I was given a day-old loaf.
