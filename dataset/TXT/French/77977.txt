YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g I'm borderline between 3 & 4 stars.  

I would hate to ever get stuck sitting on the patio where everyone wandering through Mandalay Bay can gawk at you eating. Luckily I've always been seating inside. I've never had an issue with service and have enjoyed pretty much everything i have eaten. 

Thumbs up to: 
Onion soup shooter
Tuna tacos
oysters w/  sorbet. (fun presentation on dry ice)
in the shower mac & cheese

After dining here 4 or so times, last night we tried something new. The summer prix fixe menu. This is by far the best section of plates I have ever had @ Fleur. 
tomato/avocado gazpacho, braised short rib lasagna, black cod, nutella french toast!

For the fun of it, you should get any one of the specialty cocktails with the liquid nitrogen. The Bailys Ice Cream Espresso, but try the espresso martini for the extra buzz!
