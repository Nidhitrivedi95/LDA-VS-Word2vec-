6Hj4AQ5DDGf7tsVk6LscLQ Thank-you Yelpers for recommending this place. A friend and I were looking for a place to have brunch that was within walking distance of the finish of the Toronto half marathon.  The reviews I read were very positive and so was our experience.  The food was great- we both had the scrambled eggs with brie and spinach (delicious!) and it came with several sides (toast, salad, potatoes, fruit, and choice of meat (e.g. bacon, merguez sausage).  The coffee was very good and I also had a Stiegel Radler (a low alcohol "grapefruit" beer)-  very refreshing.  The servers were very attentive and friendly.  I highly recommend it and I will be back (maybe after the Sporting Life 10K?)
