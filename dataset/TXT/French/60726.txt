SCklYa_jhihWAcfIn-_chg Five star brunch brought down a star by weak service. The Eggs Benedict was excellent, hot chocolate in a bowl was good, and they have a nice patio.

The bad news is that the service was lacking. The woman running the joint was straight up rude and gave the impression she really didn't want to be there; she fully rolled her eyes and sighed when I asked if it was possible to sit on the patio. Our server was alright but not super friendly and she seemed like she was in a ridiculous rush, which was odd given that there were plenty of servers and the place wasn't that busy.

I got a few croissants to go and they were phenomenal.
