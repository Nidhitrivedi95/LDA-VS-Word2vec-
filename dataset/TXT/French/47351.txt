O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q Every time I'm in Vegas , I go to this place. So far I have never been disappointed. The meat is great, so is the service and the interior. I really feel welcome here as soon as I have one foot in the door.

Try a cheese selection for desert and then ask them to teach you about it. It's awesome!

Will definately stop by next time again!
