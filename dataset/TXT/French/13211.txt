4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Mon Ami Gabi was our best meal in Vegas. We didn't do any tasting menus or Michelin stars but Mon Ami Gabi was far better than any buffet meal and sit down restaurant we have had in Vegas.

I always heard good things about Mon Ami Gabi. Our experience from start to finish far exceeded any expectation I had about the place. We didn't have reservations and we were seated at the best seat in the house- right in front of the Bellagio fountain outdoors under a heat lamp. The place was full and the service never fell short. It was welcoming, friendly, and French enough for it not to feel cheapened for Vegas.

We started with the Onion Soup Au Gratin and it was delicious and rich. It was also very hot, so let it cool down for a few minutes before you dig in if you order it. I loved the complimentary baguette Mon Ami Gabi serves. It was piping hot from the oven and in a paper bag as if it came from a bakery. For our entrees, we got a Roquefort steak frites and Caramelized Sea Scallops. I was a bit concerned with the size of the steak but when we got it, the steak was as big as the plate. The flavor was amazing, steak was juicy, tender, and the frites very crispy. The sea scallops were also a good size/portion. They were excellent and the sides of mushrooms and spaetzle added a nice touch. It is a very buttery dish. We were too full for desserts in the end.

The ambiance at Mon Ami Gabi is great. You can fancy it up by dressing up but casual attire is totally acceptable as this is not a stuffy place at all. The tables are close together enough that you will hear everyone's conversation. Luckily for us everyone was in good spirits and the happy atmosphere filled with laughs and stories added to the good vibe.
