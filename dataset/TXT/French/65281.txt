u-SvRRAfYgpbXZRfQgcTzA "Disappointed", "underwhelming", "overpriced" and "over-sauced" are all adjectives that came to mind while eating at Imadake. From reading earlier reviews here, I think we ordered all the right items (octopus balls, okonomiyaki, that fried chicken with wasabi mayo dish, jellyfish salad, black cod), but none of them were that great. The cod was rubbery, unlike at other Japanese restaurants in Montreal (for example, Azuma on St-Laurent had a wonderful black cod). The octopus balls were gummy with un-cooked tempura batter in the center and slathered in salty sauce. The okonomiyaki was so completely covered in sauce, that this was the only thing we could taste. That, and a strange, almost cornmeal-y consistency unlike any other okonomiyakis I've experienced (granted I've only had it once before, in NYC, but it was a wonderful streetfood-style dish there; here, not anything I'd recommend, even if you got the sauce on the side--which I would recommend doing, if you choose to try this dish). We didn't order anything to drink, and to the best of my knowledge, only ordered the five small dishes listed above, plus one order of mochi, and it cost us $67 before tip. I certainly won't be returning. I think this place is more about the scene, as it's got a trendy vibe to it; it's a trendy-slathered-in-oyster-sauce kind of place.
