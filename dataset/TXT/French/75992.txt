ynYEgNimJOyb8dvyr9x0sA I had the blue cheese flammenkuchen, which was a tasty mix of blue cheese and apples on a flaky crust. Delicious, but I would hesitate to say that it was worth $13.50, though the portion size was decent. Dessert was the crepe flambe with Grand Marnier. It was overwhelmed by the flavor of the candied orange peel, and the crepe had no flavor on it's own. The crepe fell apart, and was floppy and unappealing. I finished the ice cream, and left most of the crepe itself on the plate. Service was fine, I didn't have any of the issues that previous reviewers did. Overall, an ok meal, but more expensive than I would like, given the quality of the meal as a whole.
