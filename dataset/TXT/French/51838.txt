Escargot-Tasty

Seared Foie Gras-Just right

Lobster thermador-Heavy in a perfect and delectable way.

Venison-Perfect!

Vegetables-Cooked perfectly. One of the only times I would actually want more.

Pinot Noir- Nice selection chosen by the sommelier. Went well with everything.

Souffle-This is the only thing I had a slight problem with. Instead of going with a classic chocolate or Grand Marnier, we opted for the white chocolate with mixed berry souffle. Although unique, I don't think it worked too well. I am no authority on souffles but in my opinion ion it was too mushy inside, the consistency of oatmeal. It was relayed by our waiter that the use of the berries caused the mushiness. Makes sense but my argument would be to not serve it then. I wasn't there for uniqueness but solid, mastered classics.
