SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA Since moving to the East side this indeed is one of my favorites! What's not to love? We enjoy sitting at the bar booths the atmosphere is always nice and softly romantic in a great way. The cocktails Rick prepares are always on point, fabulous martinis. Furthermore Rick is informative and always so gracious very attentive with a great knowledge of the menu always having great suggestions. Should I mention "The Food" and presentation are absolutely amazing!! Zack we love all your Restaurants but this is our favorite!!
