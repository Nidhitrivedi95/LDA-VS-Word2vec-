fyJAqmweGm8VXnpU4CWGNw We arrived after 1pm for lunch.
There was a line.  
After waiting to order for about 5 min.  our order was taken.

We waited a long time for our food, but the glass of white house wine held us over.

Constant companion had the shrimp po' boy, very good.  I had the uptowner, also very good and pomme frites with garlic aioli, also very good.

But the beignets were a bit under done.  We cut off the edges on two and left the third in an order of three.

This is not fast food.  Come when you have time.

The cheese counter looked amazing as did yhe desserts!  I will try it the next time.

Oh, another 5 minute wait to buy wine and bread.  But both are so good!

Be patient, it is very good.
