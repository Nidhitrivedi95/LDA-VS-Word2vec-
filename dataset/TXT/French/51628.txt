pKiSzUlBBRNEdTML24piXA Just a quick review... Had the seven course tasting menu plus wine pairing.  Overall it was a great experience.  Each course was artfully displayed and tasty.  Wines were described in great detail. 

We sat next to the kitchen, which added to the experience as we got to see each dish prepared.  Wait staff was friendly and very attentive without hovering.  

We'll be back!
