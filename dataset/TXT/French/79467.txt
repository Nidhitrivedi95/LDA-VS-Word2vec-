Zm49-4emuoqhfb-nOPEYOg Spanel was a wonderful place for an unexpected meal! We found it just walking by and decided to stop in. Everything on the menu looked great, I wanted to try it all! The crepes were delicious and the soup was fantastic as well. The chef (owner?) and waiter were wonderfully welcoming and accommodating. They even made a special meal for my friend who is a vegan, and she said it was delicious. I would definitely recommend this place to people looking for a fun meal in Montreal.
