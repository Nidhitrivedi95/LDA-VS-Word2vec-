D7Wv_B7GBbrx-EDfgxDwRA They started poorly when I asked for a quiet table and they put me in the bar directly under a speaker.  I asked to be reseated and they moved me to the dining room...out front...under a speaker.  Ordered iced tea and got a glass of what tasted like canned Lipton.  The side Ceaser salad was a good size but fairly salty.  I should have tried the mixed.  I ordered the Big Devil Burger with fries.  Still waiting for it to arrive.  Both the tea and water are long empty and the salad is long gone...  The wait staff is more interested in hanging around the hostess desk than waiting on me.
Burger and fries arrived.  Fries were hot.  Shoe string size, light salt - OK but not great.  The burger was a disappointment.  Dripping grease and still the bun was chewy.  I am not sure how they managed to drain the flavor out of bacon, cheese, 2 onion rings and the beef  patty but they did.  Next time I will go to the giant orange burger stand across the street.  Not coming back here.  You should not either.
