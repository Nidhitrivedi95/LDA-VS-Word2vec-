Xw50tINqzrI_BM_x7_IcZA Probably repeating what others have said, sorry. 1. Best crepes in Toronto. 2. Super nice service. 3. Worst location in Toronto. This place is really more on Queen & not Spadina. It's in the Jewish Centre building on Spadina, but again on the Queen side. I went in with four others (only one couple sitting/eating) & we were bumping into each other while waiting. I like the lemon drink they push but Jeesh, their stockpiles take up way too much room right in the middle of the place. I think it's a pain to eat crepes on the go, especially nutella/choc, it invariably ends up on your face. If it's not too crowded or if the patio is open, definitely give them a try.
