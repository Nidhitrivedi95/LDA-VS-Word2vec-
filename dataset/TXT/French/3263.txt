1cGyzWtfOoDiE8V0OR85yA Food - mediocre.
Service - average.
Staff - not striking with knowledge or friendliness.

If you still get enticed by sort of cute look of the cafe and decide to enjoy seating outside (on their one and only table)  -  getting anything beyond and above a simple cup of coffee or a tea is just not worthy money and time spent

Even in Pittsburgh (which can't really boast to have more than singular option for pretty much any type of fine food) you can do better than this...
