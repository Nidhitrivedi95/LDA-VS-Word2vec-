4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Escargots as an app-5 stars!! Garlic parsley butter is so delicious! Comes sizzling hot and only 6. I hella dip my bread in it. 

Scallops entree- 4 stars , wish mine was cooked 30 secs longer.

Bf had- skate wing entree- not a fan. Thought it was weird n I didn't know much about it. It's lightly breaded n served whipped cauliflower n something else.

Would I recommend this place n return here again? Yes! Great location, great food, n great service.

Tips: sit outside the patio which is first come first serve. U cannot make a reservation. We waited 20 mins for a table on a Monday a little before 10 pm.
