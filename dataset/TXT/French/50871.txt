oZHbPhIj01_31jqD053a_Q This is probably the fanciest restaurant in Montreal, and it was worth every penny. This was our splurge meal while we were in the city, so we went for the 10-course tasting menu with wine pairing. Ten courses is a lot, of course, but tasting menus are usually very small, "tasting" portions. The portions here at Europea were not always as small as typical tasting portions, but on top of that, you get way more food than the ten courses you pay for. I think they must have served us 4 amuse-bouches before the tasting menu even begun! And the final sweet dessert course was also several different items, more than just one sweet. 

And then -- and then! -- they even sent us home with more packaged food! Carrmelized nuts, cookies, a meringue... The whole thing was absolutely bananas. 

If you are looking for a special occasion meal in Montreal and are willing to spend the money on it, look no further. If you are looking to spend less, you may still order here a la carte and eat very well. Everything was spectacular. Highly recommended!
