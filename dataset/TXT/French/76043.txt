ynYEgNimJOyb8dvyr9x0sA Not sure how this one does well. Possibly the worst steak I've ever eaten and my wife's was just as bad. Keep in mind, I've eaten steak at IHOP. Very tough and super salty. Cheese fondue was nothing to write home about either. The crepes were good, but it's hard to mess up chocolate and sugar. 

I won't return.
