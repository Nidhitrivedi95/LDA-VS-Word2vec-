UWupVhvb1qWZh8rNowJliQ My friend and had a wonderful lunch at Woods Restaurant at the end of March.  We loved the elegant yet earthy decor and the attention to detail.  It made for a very pleasant dining experience.      

We shared the scallops and foie gras to start.  The scallop portion was on the small side (3 on a plate) but they were delicious.  The foie gras was amazing!  Some of the best I've ever had and the portion size was surprisingly generous.  

My friend had the roasted Muscovy duck breast and I had the Pacific Cod.  Both were excellent - perfectly prepared and beautifully presented.  

We had a little room left for dessert so we ordered the Pavlova (a work of art on a plate - I posted a picture) and the maple tart which was so rich we couldn't finish.  

We will most definitely be back to Woods.
