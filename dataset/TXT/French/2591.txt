0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g We arrived early to our 8:45 reservation and expected to just drop off the wine and walk around for twenty minutes until it was time but was informed that if we wanted to sit in the lounge/bar area that they could seat us earlier. Very nice service from the start. 
The Picasso art hanging throughout is remarkable. The flowers and atmosphere- outstanding without being stuffy. We were sat next to the window and watched the fountains go off. Our server was exceptional. He said he'd been there for 15+ years and it made me think that they must not have much turnover in employees and its a good sign to have loyal employees for that long. 
The star though was the food. I was amused to learn that they call the squab- pigeon and the venison is referred to as deer, simplicity at its best. 
I had the butternut soup, the trout, and the pigeon. So good. Small taste portions but I was completely satisfied and happy to end it with the pear dessert and a great cup of coffee. A night and meal I will remember. Worth every star on yelp and every Michelin star its known for.  We were sent home with a little box with a couple muffins in them. Nice touch.
