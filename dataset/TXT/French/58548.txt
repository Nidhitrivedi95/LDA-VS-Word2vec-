RfsMUrGUJdrpfrU54rmEsQ For a recent wedding anniversary, my wife found out about this Cuisine & Wine Bistro, which we had never previously heard of.  So we went there relatively early one evening so that way we could beat the crowd.  It maintains a fabulously casual atmosphere with a bar, tables, and couches for various kinds of lounging about and eating.  The staff have all been super as well as super-friendly, willing to make recommendations for newcomers to the restaurant.  We're not big wine drinkers, and they were even able to make recommendations to help create a better dining experiences for us novices.  As for the appetizers?  They specialize in bruschetta, and they even rotate their various choices in and out on a monthly basis so that you're always able to try new combinations.  The steaks we've had have been exceptional, and this has become one of the places in our regular restaurant rotation.  Lovely place.
