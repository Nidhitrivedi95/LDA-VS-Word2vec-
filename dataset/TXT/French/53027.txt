QeFsIMcIFIJcOrpthYL8jg [Montreal Food Tour Stop #3] Modavie Resto-Bar is a hip restaurant with tasty French food in the middle of Old Montreal.  I was looking for a slightly more upscale meal to enjoy my second night in the city.  There's a medium sized cocktail menu and a decently sized wine menu.  Some dishes on the menu include foie gras, beef tartare, steak frites, salmon, and ratatouille.  Also, live music is played every night.  I skipped the wine and went for a three course meal with my friends.  

Highlights: The poutine here is excellent.  There was only one type of poutine on the menu.  It was served with your standard cheese curds and gravy - but there was also braised lamb.  This is a big upgrade from poutine from ground meat (which is also good too, but lamb makes it great).  The meat was soft and tasty and the overall dish was not too salty.  For my entree, I ordered the market catch of the day, which was halibut served with risotto and vegetables.  The entree was very light and I really liked my risotto.  Our waiter was entertaining - he was boasting that Modavie's poutine was the best in all of Montreal.  I admit that I haven't tried enough poutine in the city to back this claim, but it is very good and I will recommend it.  For dessert, I ordered the creme brûlée.  Decent - not outstanding, but good in my opinion.

Critiques: I would have preferred that my halibut be seasoned a little more.  I definitely had a good time at Modavie, but judging overall taste and price, this is probably 4 stars in terms of value.

Overall: Very good food in a great part of Montreal.  You'll have a pleasant time and enjoy a tasty meal with good service.  Also, lamb is the way to go when you're choosing a meat to add to your poutine.
