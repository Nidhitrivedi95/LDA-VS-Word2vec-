xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g Wife and I eat out a lot both on and off the strip and knowing the strip prices are generally higher.
This place does indeed offer a spectacular view and I found service to be very good, although tables are too tight together for the prices they charge. 
Wine prices are rather ridiculously high. .I paid $110 for half bottle of average CA cab.
I eat escargot all over the world and this was one of  the worst ....visually it looked good but far too much "fufu" around the tiny snails, very little garlic taste and served warm. ... My error in not turning it back immediately. 
My venison was cooked correctly and tastes very good, my wife's filet was more medium than MR,  which she had asked for. 
Sides were excellent in taste but way overpriced for the small portion
Souffle was excellent.
