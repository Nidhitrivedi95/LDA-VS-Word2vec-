j0baDQfMAGDm_QGdFMmb-Q This is a delightful French restaurant.  The interior is intimate and attractive.  The husband/wife team are engaging and sweet.  I ordered the steak and frites which were done perfectly.  I love the French portions--not too big or small. The pepper sauce was perfect and the steak was soft, flavorful and moist.  The fries were some of the best I have had.  When I asked for bread, the waitress said it would take about 10 minutes because they bake it fresh in the oven.  I said don't worry about it and a few minutes later she came out with some toast to satisfy my bread craving.

Afterwards I had the creme brulee and an espresso and again both were excellent.  If you have a craving for some of the foods you probably eat anyway but you want it prepared the way the French do, come here.  You'll hear only french music and the entire experience captures a bit of France in Scottsdale.
