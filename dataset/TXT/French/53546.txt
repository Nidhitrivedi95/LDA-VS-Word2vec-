qltrxd6_usFu1Q0mM5ZCNQ Came here for New Years dinner and loved loved! First, they called us ahead to make sure no one had any food allergies since it was a set menu. It's always appreciated when restaurants are mindful as such.

The layout and space is modern, cozy with the open kitchen being the center of attention. It was a great experience watching what was about to be served at your table. 

I'm not so adventurous with meat nor is French food my meal of choice. But everything from the rabbit ravioli to the sweetbreads surf and turf was fabulous! 

Service was excellent. And they spaced out the courses just right!

I will surely be returning to La Fabrique upon my next trip to Montréal! It's a keeper!
