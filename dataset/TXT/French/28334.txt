EEIz44ewHhOKmfTloAK13g It's a beautiful restaurant but overpriced. The spinach stuffed chicken was delicious and it's a must have! I love the texture of this dish from the baked chicken with a bit of crisp skin, flavourful little bites of round pasta and bacon combined with This beautiful purée that just dances in your mouth. The duck pizza with potatoes mediocre - there any many places with better stone oven baked pizza in the city nowadays. The grilled octopus was slightly over cooked unfortunately.
