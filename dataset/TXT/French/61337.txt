SJo_IjvzdRtCvZVN0cbrRQ Fantastic, wonderful food and service!! First time for us to eat here we really enjoyed the Sunday Brunch so much. I do recommend making reservations thankfully we did, it was 12:30 and very busy. We didn't know what to expect when we arrived, just a small gray building no sign to state this was the cafe except for the blue door. We are not from the area and hoped we had the right place. It is small and cramped inside, everyone is pretty much on top of each other when it's busy. The hostess was very friendly, we arrived a little early and had to wait a few minutes for a table, we sat on a bench next to the bakery the hostess told us they bake everything fresh daily. Everything looked delicious!! When we sat at our table it was comfortable even with being busy we seemed like we were in a good spot. Our server was great very knowledgeable and friendly. She explained the items on the menu. She was very attentive and made us feel welcome. The food was superb really very good!! We go to brunch at different places often and this place by far is top notch. We will definitely be back! I highly recommend trying this place!!  The place was clean, unfortunately only one bathroom for women and the bathrooms are close to the eating areas. I didn't like that so much. Also, a little on the pricey side for everything. Still a yummy place to try.
