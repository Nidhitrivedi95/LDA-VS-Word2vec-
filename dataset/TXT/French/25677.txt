Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA We spent a lot of time here waiting to get in. Not because they were crowded but because the woman downstairs was very insistent that they opened, "in 7 minutes." 

When we finally got upstairs there was no one in sight. We wandered around the backside of the bar to watch the sun set and found the staff still in their pre-opening staff meeting. The manager politely indicated they would be with us as soon as they were through. i.e. Go away, you'll get a drink when WE'RE ready.  I let him know we'd be outside when they were done.  

Unfortunately, the patio is on the wrong side of the building to watch the sun set - but I guess we're there to see Vegas, right?

Eventually one of the waitresses sauntered out.  I ordered a glass of Scharffenberger champagne.  It was a surprisingly reasonable $13.  Their other by the glass champagnes are higher-end and French with prices reaching $30.  Their cheapest champagne is $12 - one from New Mexico?!?  I've had it before and it wasn't pretty.   Gruet is served everywhere in LV, and I mean everywhere!  Sorry, New Mexico, but I have rules while in Vegas!  

Las Vegas rule #5: no champagne from New Mexico!

I would go back for the view (make sure you check what time sunset starts) and the drinks, but not management's attitude. 

OH!  And be sure to check out their bathrooms.  If you go early like we did you can see them both.

I've heard the food there is amazing, but will check that out next time.
