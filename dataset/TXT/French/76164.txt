Yp1swb-8pO8i-6-jaK2tsA My boyfriend and I ate here today for breakfast.  I ordered the corn-beef hash eggs benedict and my boyfriend ordered the strawberry waffles.  Food was better than I expected!  Not your typical breakfast joint compared to I-hop and Denny's; will choose Mimi's over I-hop and Denny's any day!

I give the taste and presentation of the food a 5-star, but since service was OK I give Mimi's an overall 4-star.
