kIW8IeTV3W1tS_q_WAU4wQ One word comes to mind - Pretentious.  If you want to know what going to Le Local feels like, pull out a few $20 bills, spread some butter on it and eat it.  Wash it down with some water and pretend you just drank a cocktail.

It amazes me that this place has over 3 stars, especially after eating at various local restaurants in the area.  After a week of dining in and around Montreal (Vieux Montreal mostly) I can safely say this place is one of the most expensive places I visited and had the worst food overall.

How do you screw up Poutine??  For those that don't know Poutine, it's a local favorite in Montreal, combining french fries with cheese curds, topped with delicious gravy.  And somehow Le Local found a way to screw up this simple recipe.

My wife and I bought two drinks (a Mojito and a Martini) and they were both diluted to the point where it was hard to distinguish it from plain water. Oh, and they were $10+ each.  Needless to say, we didn't order another.

Next up - the bread.  I rarely ever comment on bread, but it was so terrible I feel the need to warn others.  For a restaurant that charges as much as it does, having stale bread that tastes like you're chewing on someone else's gum is just unacceptable.  How about serving some freshly baked bread, preferably something with flavor?

The only saving grace was the Veal Burger, which was pretty damn good.  Not good enough to warrant the price, but it was good.  I don't even remember what my wife ordered - it was some odd tasting fish that she didn't eat.

Overall this was a giant skid mark in an otherwise splendid trip to Montreal.  Save your money and go somewhere else.  Anywhere else.  It's hard to find something that's worse.
