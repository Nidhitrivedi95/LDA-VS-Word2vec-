xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g The main reason I came to eat here was for the view. And it was the best part. All tables get a view of the Bellagio's water fountain, although not every table has the best view. It felt awkward to take pictures inside the restaurant, but my family had no problem flashing away at everything.

Now the food and cocktails. Cocktails were upwards of $16. We had the Pimm's Cup, Red Velvet, and Sparkling Passion. All of them were extremely good and perfectly mixed. We ordered the warm foie gras to start. It's so tiny the four slices of pear that accompany it was a bigger portion. But it was smooth and melt in your mouth. Definitely not worth the price. Next to come out was the veal medallions. This is a must get; it was delicious. We had it come out with the appetizers.

Now for the entrees:
They ran out of black cod, by the time we got there, so we got the sea bass. It was good, a might order again.
The cured duck breast was not that great. I like fatty Chinese roasted duck much better, a definite will not order again.
Rack of lamb was perfect; cooked to perfection and tasted so tender, will order again.
We had two New York steaks, both ordered medium rare, but one came out a little drier. It is also a will order again. I regret not ordering a surf and turf instead of the second NY steak.

To finish off, we had ordered two souffles when told they need to be ordered in advanced. Not sure if we ate too quickly, but we waited a good fifteen minutes between the entrees and dessert. But then they came, one chocolate souffle, and the other waiter-recommended grand marnier souffle. Both were great, but definitely the grand marnier souffle was the best, will come just for this!

In all, the food was great. Not sure I would come back because it didn't seem like the food was worth the price. Next time, I'll just stick at the bar for the view.
