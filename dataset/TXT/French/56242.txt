rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Why oh why do they mess with perfection? They changed the recipe of the two items I always get here. The eggs Benedict which used to be spectacular are now just totally average. Now they're using shaved ham which tasted cheap, and I think the muffin changed, no longer thin and crispy.

They also seem to have changed the cheese Danish and about doubled the filling. More of a good thing doesn't make it necessarily better. Now the filling is so overwhelming there is no balance with the pastry. Like a gob of frosting.  Didn't help that the waiter who served it announced "cheese Danish made with Philadelphia brand cream cheese". Not that I really care it was just off-putting somehow. Tacky

First time ever that they brought the butter and jam but no bread so I wasn't sure what the purpose of it was. I noticed the waitress notice there was no bread but she didn't say anything. Again, tacky. At least she should have asked "did we forget the bread" 

I will still go and bring many people a few times a year, and this was the first time I had this experience in many years, so I'm going to just try something else from the menu, but I really can't grasp why you would mess with perfection. I know restaurants have to change it up, but do it be adding an item not trying to be creative with something so exquisite that all you do is ruin it!
