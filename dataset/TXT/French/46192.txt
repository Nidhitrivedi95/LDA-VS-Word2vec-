myJ6pgIhN42EQh2sAVXKoQ I did not know what to expect with TOMA.  Their branding is not exactly Queen West (read: they don't have the "rustic" hipster-y decor and its not filled with bearded guys wearing plaid).  I decided to give it a try.  It was hands down the best burger I have had in this city.  I had the Diablo.  Every element of that burger is perfect.  The burger patty is large and juicy and most importantly it tastes very good and is cooked perfectly.  The bun is incredible and doesn't get smooshed up in the largesse of the patty - it holds its own.  The bacon is also perfectly cooked. 

I don't think this place is competing in the Toronto burger wars for a few reasons:
1. the ingredients are top notch.  I believe the bun is homemade brioche and the patty is prime rib. It honestly tastes way better than your standard burger.
2. You can drink here.  That's right - unlike other burger places Toma has wine and beer.
3. The decor is somewhat upscale, which I will grant you is kind of weird for a burger joint.  But I think the idea behind TOMA is less "fast food" and more "sit down and eat something well made for once in your sad life".  It works.

I was very impressed. If you want to enjoy a seriously solid burger I would highly recommend TOMA.
