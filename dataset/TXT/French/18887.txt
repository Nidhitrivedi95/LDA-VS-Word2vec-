aM4pb4teV2Tr0Z-ZRt4icg LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place! Very cute, clean and cheerful interior in the Scottsdale quarter. The gelato is delicious, the macaroons are to die for and my personal favorites are the chocolates (which are decorated beautifully...they look like glass)! This place is a little pricey but definitely worth the money! They have a few tables inside to enjoy there but I usually just get my treats to go! I've been there a few times now and every employee that has assisted me has been an absolute delight!
