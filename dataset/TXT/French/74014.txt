xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g I ate at Eiffel Tower last week for the the third time ever, and always at lunch.  If you have reservations (I make mine through OpenTable), you always get seated before the walk-ins.   They open for lunch at 11:30, and even if there were about 10 other people that had been waiting, my cousin and I were seated first.  The meal usually starts with a vegetable mousse in a tiny cup that you eat with a tiny spoon.  I've had tomato and spinach in the past and while they were delicious, this time we had mushroom.  And it was splendid.  My favorite meal is pretty standard here: Crab-stuffed avacado, pan-seared trout with butter and wild rice, and the summer berry pudding dessert.  To drink: Ginger Peach Tea.  My cousin ordered a fois gras appetizer with fig and a salmon entree with the fish hammered flat, seasoned, and fried.  We both had a bowl of the cream of celery soup.  The food is DELICIOUS!  A huge bonus is the tiny cheese and poppy seed popovers that they give you with every meal.  The service is attentive, at times a bit much, but  way better than being ignored.  Our check came out to about $200.  Eiffel Tower is always a must visit when I'm in town.
