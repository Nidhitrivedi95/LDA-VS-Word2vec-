E9HkUYYO_-5vKjvBwLuDIw Here first for lunch, then recently dinner. Both meals have been trés bon. We have savored the onion soup (a big hit with my husband), the escargot, quiche with brie, beet salad, butter lettuce salad, mussels poulette (a new preparation to me - I will have to try the marinere to see which I like best) and duck breast with asparagus and poached peach. Cafe Americano was delicious. The only disappointment to our palates was the créme brûlée. We appreciated the attention given by Chef/Owner Richard (one of our tablemates is from France which engendered the usual bonhomie) and the service par excellence from Anthony. We'll be back!
