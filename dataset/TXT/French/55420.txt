rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Really had a great experience here! Food, decor and service are excellent. We came for an early morning breakfast and enjoyed the entire meal from start to finish. For starters, the coffee is excellent and goes really well with the raspberry beignets. The food overall is tasty and esthetically plated. 

What I appreciated most of all was the excellent customer service! My mom is allergic to wine, which we discovered was accidentally in her dish. Luckily, my mom asked about the dressing and we caught the mistake before eating anything. When we told the waitress, she apologized, made accommodations for her meal and even compensated her meal. The manager and the waitress made a concerted effort to take care of the issue in a timely and efficient manner. We really appreciated that the entire staff attended to the issue in a timely and professional manner and to top it off, my mom really enjoyed her meal once the kitchen made accommodations!! This restaurant is definitely excellent and one we will be coming back to in the future!
