_cjPEH9wXhKS-HQe_U3M4Q the food was fucking ass. The steak tartare and frites were an absolute joke. The steak was terribly cooked but the fries were decent initially but they were very salty at the bottom (obviously if they sprinkled salt onto the fries after putting them on the plate). The french onion soup was TERRIBLY CHEESY. There was too much cheese and too little bread. Had more bread been in the soup, it would have soaked more of the soup and less cheese would have been much appreciated. All in all, I'm never returning again.
