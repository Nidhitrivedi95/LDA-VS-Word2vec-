mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q In a city that can boast  more fine restaurants per square block than any other I know of, this restaurant stands tall.  Dine at the chef's "table" whenever possible to add to your experience.
Each dish brings a new level of texture, flavor and beauty.  When the butter served causes each of us to spends days trying to find and buy the product ( can't be done unless you want to fly to Paris )' what can you say about all the rest.   This is an experience not to miss if your budget can take the hit.  The reviewers who complain about not enough food, should stick with the steak houses and leave this gem to those who can appreciate  this level of  cuisine.
