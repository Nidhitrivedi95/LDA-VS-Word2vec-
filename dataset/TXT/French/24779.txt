COgwFthJpS4We16W5Gf4lw Will never forget this place! So romantic and French and the soufflés were to DIE for.. the fruit and vegetable basket was adorable and filling! the only thing was how pricey the main course was, and we didn't particularly like it either. But the dessert made up for it! Amazing!
