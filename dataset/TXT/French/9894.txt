4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw We booked our 12:30 reservation through yelp an hour or so before. Upon arrival, we were seated within 10 minutes to a nice table in the covered area near the patio. I was relieved since it was really windy and surprising chilly outside. The restaurant was pretty busy, but we received ample attention; the server was really sweet.

I love baguette, and a good size was served in the beginning wrapped in a Mon Ami Gabi bag with butter. It came in a Mon Ami Gabi bag; it was cute how you're left to just tear a piece of bread for your enjoyment rather than coming out cut in a basket.

Food:
Chopped Greens & 7 Vegetables (Lunch Menu): had it without the blue cheese, came tossed & with avocado / The salad had more content than its name gives it credit for. It came with bacon, and personally, I'm not a bacon person, but it was some good bacon. It was thicker than normal breakfast bacon and gave the salad a nice balance since I didn't add chicken or anything.

Corned Beef Hash & Poached Eggs (Brunch Menu): Good quality meat, well-poached eggs, yolk was used to mix the meal together / People who enjoy hash and like their eggs poached will love the item.

I felt the menu was a bit limited, but still had a great brunch. Food, ambiance, service, and people were all great.
