Walking in here, it does remind me of Belgium. All wooden interior with two lengthy bars and pub-style mirrors. There is an extensive bottled beer list and also a small but well-curated draft list that included some very hard to find, excellent beers. I went for the Saison Rustique by Brasserie Dunham. Though Canadian, this Belgian Saison was out of this world good. That is to give credit also to the restaurant for caring for their kegs and draft system. It was served in correct glassware as well. Our server was very knowledgeable about the menu and the beers offered. 

I ordered what was clearly labeled as their house specialty, moules frites. The fries were a tad too sallty, but very tasty. The mussels didn't have enough sauce in the bottom of pot and the sauce was much too watery. It needed to be better seasoned and much thicker in my opinion. My wife had the butternut squash soup and liked it.

Overall, we had a nice time. The atmosphere was a bit more quiet, upscale, and intimate than I was expecting. I think it would do well as a date night sort of place vs. a beer drinking and quick eats gastropub.
