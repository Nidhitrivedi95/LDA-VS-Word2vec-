gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg Restaurant was always very busy, but the wait time for a table was very short. Food was consistently average - above average but not spectacular. All of the versions of their beer have a little hop to them and A slightly bitter finish.  Had a flamm as my first meal and unfortunately while all the toppings were tasty, the flatbread itself was very soggy. The poutine was delicious on two different occasions.

Service was always polite but what you would expect in a big, busy restaurant.
