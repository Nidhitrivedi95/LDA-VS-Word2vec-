H464UiJ5c7q5dAJ14h731A Discovered this restaurant recently. We called in at 5 pm, hoping to get a reservation around 9 pm for 2 people and we got it. We did ask to sit at a table, but in the end, we sat at the bar. For starters, I ordered an old-fashioned cocktail... it was okay, not the best I've had.
For entrees, we had the sausage/pieuvre one with the nachos/foie gras one. The pieuvre was tender, but the portion was really small. As for the nachos/foie gras, it was delicious. My boyfriend, who is picky, couldn't stop eating it.
For our main course, we ordered the pork chop and the lamb. The meat was grilled to perfection and I liked their mashed potatoes. It was definitely worth eating there.
For desserts, we got the chocolate cake which is topped with like a barley cheesecake mixture and the apple poudding chomeur. The desserts were not as sweet, so it was perfect for my palette. It was definitely the best desserts I've ever ate. 
The bill came out to be slightly expensive, but  it was worth the trip, since the waitresses were really attentive to us and the owner tried to talk to us as well to make us feel welcome. 
I would definitely return :)
