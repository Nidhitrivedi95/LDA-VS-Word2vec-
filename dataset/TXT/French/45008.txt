mT8Ej8sKFJoIa5G0Vl4AKA RIBS RIBS RIBS!!! Apparently this is the place to go for ribs. I'll have to give it to them, it was juicy and falling off the bone. But it wasn't flavorful or saucy enough. We had to ask the waiter to bring more sauce, but by the time he got it for us we were almost half way done.

I got the porterhouse Pittsburgh style, which was quite delicious. The sides are huge. I opted out of the butter and garlic, so got the bowl of sauteed mushrooms on the side to top my steak. I had enough to share with my table of 11. Very reasonably priced and it was super crowded on a Sunday night. Our waiter was pretty good, he was pretty busy himself attending to all of us.

I would come back for a nice, meaty meal with a group of friends.
