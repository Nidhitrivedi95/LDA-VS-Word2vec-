my husband ordered the french onion soup (ok - but, really, how can you go wrong with french onion soup?) and i ordered the garlic soup (salt overload!). for our main course he ordered the skirt steak and i got the monte cristo -- again SALTY. i think if you add too much salt, you're either hiding something or CANNOT cook! won't go back again...
