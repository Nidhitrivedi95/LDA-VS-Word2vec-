MWz0bsc2-6owh93-i8p0zw Went for a work dinner and enjoyed it. Not outstanding but very solid (at the low end of 4 stars).

I had: (1) the terrine foie gras appetizer (good but not memorable), (2) the sea bass dish (excellent), and (3) the rosemary mousse (so excited to order this because I love herbs in deserts, but was disappointed w/ the taste of the final product).

Broad remarks: on apps and main dishes, everyone at the table was happy. At the time of our visit, deserts all seemed inventive and had all of us quite excited. Alas, the final verdict on these dishes were hit or miss. Everyone agreed that the rosemary mousse was a miss (generally bland w/ the dishe's highlight being the candied olives). The milk chocolate onctueux seemed to be the best of the bunch.

The restaurant itself is beautiful. It has a bar downstairs that seems like a nice hangout (it's equipped w/ a piano!) and a dining room upstairs which is stylish-casual in its decor. The service is friendly. One remark: if you like dining in peace, I recommend eating here early before the bar-crowd starts playing the piano and singing. I liked this but some folks surely would not.

Overall, this was enjoyable and I'll come back. However, it's not a high-frequency repeat or a strong recommendation (like, say, Bouillon Bilk).
