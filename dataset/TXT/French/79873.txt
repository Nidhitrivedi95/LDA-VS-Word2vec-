zra20XPGVL9P3i5hMoKjig The pasta! Get the pasta! My fiancé and I decided to have dinner here during our staycation in Old Town and we're both glad we did. I chose those place because I was being indecisive and couldn't decide what I wanted for dinner and they had multiple options. This place serves Italian dishes as well as Japanese dishes. I know it seems weird. I though the same thing too, but we couldn't decide what type of food we wanted so we chose a restaurant with both options. But BOTH are amazing! I ordered the Lollipop roll and my fiancé ordered their most popular pasta dish and both were so good I couldn't stop saying "mmmm" after every bite. I do wish their pasta portion was bigger though. We definitely wanted more and probably could've eaten double what we were given. Although, we did share. I do think I alone could've eaten double though.  

We also sat at the bar and got to talk a little with one of the waitresses and the co-owner. They were so friendly and great at recommending dishes, explaining anything on the menu, etc. They even gave us some recommendations for nearby restaurants and bars to check out on our staycation. It's tucked away in a little corner and it's a small restaurant but definitely worth the visit.
