rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A My boyfriend and I went to Bouchon for brunch on 9/19 and it was divine. The coffee, raspberry beignets (they do not scrimp on jelly!), croque madame, pommes frites, bacon (so much!), and french toast were unbelievable. The atmosphere was very relaxed and the staff were attentive and super friendly. We had a fantastic time and can't wait to head back.
