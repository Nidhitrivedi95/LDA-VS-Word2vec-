bzbNGyrTwWHAgg1CqkSgeg I love this place! I loved that we were able to grab bar seating on a Sunday at noon the moment we walked it. We were able to "skip" the line because of bar seating. YES! I felt awesome because of this. Bar seating was definitely a great experience especially for our first time at Terrace Cafe as the bar is right next to the kitchen. I can see the chefs working hard to ensure that the plates of food are set correctly before sending them out to patrons to enjoy. I enjoyed observing the chefs work while I enjoy my meal. 

FOOD
- Steak & Eggs || two perfectly cooked filet medallions, two eggs, and choice of either grits or hash browns -- I ordered both. I requested my filet medallions to be medium and they were just perfect. I ordered my eggs over easy and placed them on top of my sliced and toasted croissant. I was scared my hash browns were going to be soggy and not crispy so I ordered them to be well done or extra crispy; however, I found out that this is not needed as mine were too crispy. The Steak & Eggs were just perfect. It's a must order. I'm craving it at this moment!
- Eggs Benedict - Filet || two filet medallions, two eggs, and hollandaise sauce all on top of biscuits with a side of hash browns. Very nice twist to eggs benedict. If you're craving steak and eggs benedict at the same time --- you should try ordering this. 
- Long Island Peach Tea || Adult Drink -- very good and very strong. i love the twist that they have to the traditional Long Island by adding Peach flavors.
- Pineapple Guava Sangria || Adult Drink -- this drink was very light as it only has white wine and is mixed with lots of fruit juices like guava and pineapple. Something you should order if you're looking for a light adult drink with your meal.

SERVICE/AMBIANCE/LAST NOTES
Service was impeccable. I know we sat a the bar and service should be the best since we are right next to the kitchen, but I can see that if we sat at a regular table, our service would be impeccable as well as you see the servers working hard to get food out to patrons. The restaurant is surprisingly very spacious as there are tables upstairs and downstairs. Parking is free as you can park around the complex. If there is a wait, please see the hostess, give your name and phone numbers and she will text you when you're table is ready. 

Overall, this is my favorite restaurant by far this weekend and I will definitely come back to visit Charlotte because of Terrace Cafe. Many friends suggested that I should try the Red Velvet Waffles with a drizzle of cream cheese -- which I will try on my next visit as it is a very popular item!
