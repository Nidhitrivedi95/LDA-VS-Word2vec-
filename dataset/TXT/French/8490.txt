4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I love this place!  This is one of my favorite restaurants.  I try to have dinner here whenever I'm in Vegas.

The patio is one of the best on on the strip, right across from the Bellagio fountains.  The interior is dark, but very inviting.

The steak frites are excellent.

This is a great place to go for a romantic dinner or even a night out with the guys/girls.
