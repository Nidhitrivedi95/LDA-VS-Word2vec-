I miss the conversation
I'm searching for a song tonight
I'm changing all of the stations at...BOUCHON BAKERY! - Maroon 5 (maps)

A box of macarons for my gummy bear!!

There's six flavors to choose from and they sell a gift box with the mini-versions of each one. Our favorite by far was the caramel flavor, its sooo good! I wish they had more fruity flavors, as the raspberry stood out from other bakeries.

I got a box of the individual ones and they were packed nicely in a box. However, because of the gentle texture of macarons, I had to hand carry them all around Vegas and as an additional carry on to the plane sigh. Ultimately, of course it was worth it :) 

BUT if you're married already, I would go ahead and buy the tightly wrapped gift box with the mini macarons that you can put in your luggage and save yourself a lot of trouble =p
