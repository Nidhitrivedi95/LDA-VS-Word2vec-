sphMzEIqY1I2Dzv3zLZY2g Pretty decor, great food presentation, food is average, price is REDICULOUSE for that kind of quality. I like it that this resteraunt tries to be your above average eatery, however, the taste of the food is just plain...nothing memorable. The actual location is very hidden as well. The staff there is friendly however this doesn't make up for the average food fare.
