d482l58ho0_IMdFkXX1F5Q There were definitely hits and misses at this new place.  Unfortunately, there is so much competition in Vegas (and even in the same hotel), that I don't think we will be back.  The service was very good.  But I don't understand the bread service.  Two people get two small pieces of bread - fine.  But they are two different kinds of bread - french and focaccia!?! Now I have to figure out which we each get?  Or am I supposed to break the tiny pieces in half?  DB, don't make me think this hard at the beginning of my meal.  Seafood tower - good.  Duck/foie - great. Onion soup - okay (too little cheese and added chunks of beer), Hamachi - horrible (we both took one bite and didn't want any more because the flavors did go well together and the hamachi itself didn't taste that great).  Wine pairings were great, as suggested by our waiting (who evidently was a certified somm, and didn't a great job).
