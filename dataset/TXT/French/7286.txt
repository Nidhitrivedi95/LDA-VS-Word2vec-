4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Came here on Independence weekend. my 3rd time here after a year and the quality of service and food went down since they've gained popularity due. 

When i got there at 8:30, the greeting/book person was so rude to me. I asked for a table and I agreed to wait the 30 minutes for the patio but when i asked her if there was anywhere to sit and wait she laughed at me in a condescending matter saying "i don't know, outside?". i just wanted to leave but my family was already on their way. and when the table was available she didn't let me sit until everyone was present even though i saw my family members standing in line outside... 

waiter was nice to me, but the food's quality has gone down so so so much. i proclaimed this steak the best I've ever had before, but now its just as bad as any other. everyone asked for medium rare classic steak. and for 30 mins i was chewing beef gum. really hard to cut (got stringy) and i just couldn't chew it. the fries used to be very crispy but that night it was soggy. 

yeah... never again, there are other steakhouses on the strip.
