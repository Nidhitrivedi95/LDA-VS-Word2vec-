4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Ever time we're in Vegas we come here for lunch and the French Onion soup and we always love it.  It's never disappointed us.  They use a sweet onion carmelized with beef broth, so a classic recipe.  Never salty which can often happen with this soup.  What makes it so good is the bread and the generous portion of flavorful gruyere cheese that is perfectly fired.  

We also had the soup of the day which was caramelized onions with fennel served over creams fraiche.  It had a creamy mild flavor that was delicious.  Lastly we shared a croque madam sandwich.  All about the simplicity of good ingredients and they didn't disappoint. 

We'll be back!
