0B_aEPeZjrXs6T7vS3arrA I went planning to order crepes, and left there wishing I had.  However, the waiter gave such a lovely description of the striped sea bass special I decided to go for it. Overall disappointed in the meal. First, waiter did not offer choice of soup or salad, just brought salad for all. Some exchanged it for the soup, again wish I had! When the entree arrived it was not very appealing, there was absolutely no color, not even garnish, just 2 tiny portions of fish on a few bites of German potato salad (and the potatoes were undercooked) with 3 mini mushroom caps with a smidgen of filling. The only bright spot was the Creme Brûlée for dessert. Probably won't be going back.
