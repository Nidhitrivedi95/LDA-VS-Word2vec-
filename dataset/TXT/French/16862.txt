8xCiibfgqy-8xpCWEaguqg This restaurant has great all American style steaks. Great place to bring the guys or a group of friends. 
Don't expect a huge list of wine outside of American selections - definitely ask the waitress which one would be right for you because they did run out of a few bottles when I went. 
I only gave this location 3 stars because the service wasn't up to par.
