xcmmTXhuMx2fZF2Bt69F4w I've been to Park Brugge and have always had a great experience there - this had a similar feel.  Food was pretty tasty - for an appetizer we had the Mediterranean platter - only complaint was the hummus was a little thick.  For dinner I ordered moule frites in classic white wine which was good. The lamb ragout was just ok - probably wouldn't order that again.  Libations are a little pricey but overall good not great place.
