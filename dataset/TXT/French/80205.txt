zw4Legbcu018p5WcZ74iWA I love this place for many reasons.  I work late so it's great to have something else opened besides a McDonalds.  Of course, patati patata is not comparable to McDs.  They have cheap prices for delicious food.  The staff is very friendly and I love to watch the speed they cook and serve at, it's a show in itself. I usually get the roast beef platter and their homemade ice tea.  Both are always delicious. I have also tried their delicious burgers and French onion soup. Very good.
