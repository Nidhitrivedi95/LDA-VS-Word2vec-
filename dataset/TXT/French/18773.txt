AHosGBveeXx9YjsQvdJgeg I arranged a 33rd b-day dinner for my boyfriend at Bentley's.  The experience was FABULOUS! I asked for a some-what private table with a great view and that is exactly what we got!  Our candle lit booth with a very high back was seated right in front of the windows overlooking the city.  The waiter was very helpful recommending several wine selections that were reasonably priced.  As we had our first glass of wine we watched the sunset.  Warm fresh baked bread was served.  Ordered the  Oysters Bentley to start, amazing and fresh!!!  Next, Cesar Salads, very good.  My date ordered a platter of bison, filet and lamb.  Each bite was perfection. I ordered the special which was a mouth watering sea bass.  The wait staff was very attentive but also didn't bother us too much which I liked.  Lastly came complimentary candle lit Crème Brule that was very tasty.  A great way to end a romantic birthday dinner, leaving us both very happy and satisfied!!!  It is a bit pricey compared to other restaurants in Charlotte but definitely worth the money!  We will be going back for my 30th very soon!
