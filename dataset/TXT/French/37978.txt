Jbl6p9CVkfCB8fWYFd2-Qw The ambiance is nice and the patio is great in the summer months. Problem areas include service and the food. We were a fairly large group (about 15) but the place was nearly empty and service was still super slow. At the end of our meal, the server informed us that the bill cannot be split (sigh, living in the Cleve has made me spoiled but ok that's fine)...the kicker was he could only accept up to two credit cards (seriously?!).

Cocktails are fine, but food is completely overpriced for the quality. Pizza was meh. I ordered mussels and for a lot of money I got a pitiful amount of mussels. What was most irksome was that I politely told our server that about 1/3 to 1/2 of the mussels were either closed and thus inedible or completely empty (and no mussel remnants were found in the broth). Come on, chefs! You should know you can't serve closed mussels and empty shells. Worst part was no one from the kitchen came to apologize. Womp. If I ever come back (doubt it) I'll only get a drink. Do yourself a favor and walk an extra 20 steps over to Washington Place Bistro.
