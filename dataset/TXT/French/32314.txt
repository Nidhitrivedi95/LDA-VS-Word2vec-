We were seated at a small table by the front window and had to really raise our voices just to talk at the table - I can't imagine having been seated in the middle of the restaurant.

We shared a few starters and one main. The empanada, a seasonal special, was definitely the standout item. We also had the salmon tartare (which, to our surprise, was actually *smoked*), the trous Normand and another off-menu item, the veal in chorizo sauce. All was satisfactory, but with the slight exception of the empanada, the refined flavour combinations and certain extra special quality that sets the extraordinary apart from the simply good or above average was not there. 

No issues with the service, whatsoever.
