rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Having been to Thomas Keller's other dining establishments, I was expecting the same high-quality experience.  This was not, this was Thomas Keller for the Las Vegas masses.

The raw seafood platter was delicious - oysters, clams, lobster (yum).  But was surprised at the pedestrian-ness of the sauces (tasted like ketchup and mayonaise - when I expected something more interesting).

French fries/frites - was good, but not as good as I have had at many other places.  Could have been fried again for a more crisp texture - became wilty too quickly.

The salmon was executed well, medium rare and crisp on the outside

Bone marrow - big disappointment.  We were all looking forward to it, but it was deep-fried mess.  It was not served in the original bone.  THe bone marrow was scooped out, breaded and deep fried.  It was disgusting, to say the least and only worse after it cooled down.  Of the six of us (2 servings ordered), only 2 of us could manage to finish it.

brussel sprouts - good, but not difficult to execute in butter

broccoli rabe - disappointment, I've had fabulous rabe, and this was not. very bitter, and no real taste or texture.

Moules (mussels) - done very well, delicious and fresh in a great, dippable white wine sauce

The best part of dinner? the wonderful bread and delicious butter.
