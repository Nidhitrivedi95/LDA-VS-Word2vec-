gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg On a weekend in Montreal, my boyfriend and I stumbled on this restaurant. We went in after looking at the menu and deciding it could be good. The beer was great- they brew it themselves and it had a good flavor. We got poutine and split one of the flatbreads. Everything was absolutely delicious! The wait staff was also very friendly and helpful with tips on where to go around the city. I would come back here on my next trip to Montreal!
