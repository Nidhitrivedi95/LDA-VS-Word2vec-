tCSlpwJQ4CZsUEMZeH2SFg I just finished breakfast at Cafe Monte.  I ordered the French Country Breakfast.  The meal came out in a timely manner, but with no skillet potatoes.  I didn't realize this until after my server delivered the food.  I finished my meal before anyone came to see how things were.  I informed them that I did not receive the skillet potatoes, and was assured they would account for that on the bill.  They deducted $1.10.  A side of skillet potatoes sells for $3.50.  I understand there may be a portion difference, but I don't feel $1.10 was a sufficient discount for not receiving (fully) what I ordered, and having to let them know at the very end of my meal.  I like Cafe Monte and will come back, but this was not my best experience.
