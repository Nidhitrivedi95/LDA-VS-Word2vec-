YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g Had dinner here Tuesday evening and it was amazing.  Small and delicious, but very expensive, tapas-style<U+200B> bites.  I tried the ceviche, which was excellent, with the exception that the chips didn't taste fresh.  I just ate it without the chips.  The linguini and clams were literally insane - I can't even begin to describe how incredibly good this was.  Very garlicky but still amazing - best linguine and clams I've ever had.  The truffle gnocchi<U+200B> was also excellent.  The service was a bit stuffy, but still attentive and overall very good.  I would definitely come back herer again.
