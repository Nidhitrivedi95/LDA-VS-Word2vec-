A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g I walked into Manon and a young woman with a french accent immediately asked if she could help.  You mean this place has french pastries made by... The French?  I knew i was in the right place.  

Get the Almond Croissant! It might be better than Payard's.  Also, order a quiche, preferably the Lorraine.  Both are highly recommended!  The French Onion Soup is excellent, but if you have limited room, stick with the pastries.  Too many to try in one visit, and they all look amazing.  I will be back again and again...
