The only trouble is that the restaurant is too pricey to be a regular restaurant and yet not expensive to be a high end restaurant. As such, there were a few faux pas, I was served first (both wine and food) and had to pour my own glass several times.  This, along with the cheap paper covering the table just made me confused. Nothing to ruin it, just a few small things.
