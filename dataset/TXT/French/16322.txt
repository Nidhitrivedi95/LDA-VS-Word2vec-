7Ug8zCmY6iDTewxWqeYQ2g Yes, I am a fan of this wonderful little French bistro located in a residential area in Montreal's Plateau district. I would suggest if you wish to dine there think about making your reservation several months in advance of your visit as this is a very popular restaurant among the locals as well as visitors to the city. It is ranked as one of the very best BYOW Bistros in Montreal serving some of the finest locally sourced products from the region. The service from start to finish was impeccable. If you would like to have a 4 course meal order the Table d'hote which means adding $14 to any main course will include your appetizer, soup or salad, a main course and dessert and with an additional $9 that would include a foie gras app. I went with the Table d'Hote and had a Potato Celery Root Soup that was divine, the flavors were well balance and came through nicely. My one observation was if you serve soup in an over sized bowl the bowl must be heated in the kitchen or the soup cools rapidly which was the case here, however; the overall taste and flavor was masterful. I selected the Artic Char Gravlax which was superb, the fish was nicely flavored with dill without a hint of being over salted; it was served with little dollops of goat cheese and a dill basil pesto. My main course was Roast Lamb from Alberta over a vegetable couscous with kalamata olives. The lamb was cooked to a perfect medium rare; if you have never had Canadian lamb you are in for  wonderful treat. The couscous was a nice way to combine the dish; it was very tasty with the vegetables being perfect al dente. For dessert I chose the Crustard: Apple Cranberry Crumble with vanilla ice cream, a wonderfully balanced fruit combination which was not to sweet this proved to be a wonderful way to end the meal. Le Quartier Général is a top notch 4.5 star restaurant experience they do a superb job and should be on your list when visiting Montreal.
