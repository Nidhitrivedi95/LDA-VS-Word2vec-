AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw We had two breakfasts and one lunch at Payard over the course of three days. I know, we really liked it. And we might have had a fourth day had the food quality and service been more consistent.

First, the service. In the three times we were there, it felt like the waitresses and managers were trying to hustle us in and out. Yes, I know you're busy. And yes, I know this isn't a two hour affair type place. But simple courtesy and good manners should always come first. No speaking sternly to the customers when they're just trying to order or understand something on the menu. Not pleasant at all.

Next, the food. For breakfast we tried the classic eggs benedict (twice!), lobster eggs benedict, and chocolate french toast. For the benedicts, the hollandaise sauce that came with the classic was tangy and flavorful, but the sauce that came with the lobster was bland. The benedicts are served on a croissant which was a nice change from your standard dish. For lunch we tried the cuban sandwich and crepe madame... the cuban sandwich was hands on the winner.

All in all, Payard has potential. If they can improve the service and be more consistent with their hollandaise sauce, I might not be able to pry my husband away for another other restaurant.
