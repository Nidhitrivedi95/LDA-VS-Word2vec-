2B46bRpDh49eDyjXGhL_ZQ Came here with my mom and everything was great! The owner is working by herself which for me is a definite plus in my books as I'm a waitress myself. She explained the different types of crepes, ingredients and so forth. Coffee is good too! Love the set up and the overall experience I had here. I chose the Polo which had gorgonzola cheese, spinach and ham. it's pretty dang stinky but yummy. Thats the only way I know how to explain it lol. Mom had the Matt which consisted of cheese, mushroom and chicken. I tasted hers too and it was very good. Try this place out if you want lunch or have a sweet tooth.
