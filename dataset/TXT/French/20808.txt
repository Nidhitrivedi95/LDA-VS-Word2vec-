AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw How have I not reviewed this place yet!?  I first heard about this place from Food Network's "The Best Thing I Ever Ate."  Wolfgang Puck stated that the best macarons isn't found in Paris but at Payard Patisserie in Las Vegas.  What!?  

After hearing such a statement, Mr. W. and I made it our mission to try their macarons and boy were we not disappointed.  Their coffee macarons are amazing!  I can pack those away like none other.  It's perfectly crisp on the outside, chewy on the inside, and never overbearingly sweet.  I hate it when people overload their desserts and pastries with sugar to compensate on lack of flavor.  It's never the case here.  Everything is delicious!  The raspberry lychee macarons and the pistachio are also amongst my favorite.  I haven't tried their savory dishes and dinner but some of my other favorite desserts are the opera gateau and the louvre.  

You get what you pay for here and $30-something for a box of macarons is well worth every penny.  There's nothing I love more than receiving a box of macarons from Payard whenever Mr. W. heads to Vegas with his boys.   :)
