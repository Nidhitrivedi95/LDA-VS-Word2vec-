4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Mon Ami Gabi is one of my favorite strip restaurants. We always do lunch here and sit outside. Reservations are definatley suggested. On my last visit two of my guest steaks were cooked improperly. The staff bent over backwards to correct the issue. Awesome! I love their French Brandy Mussells. Prices are very resonable for such a view of the strip and fountain show. Look forward to seeing you in April. Keep up the great work.
