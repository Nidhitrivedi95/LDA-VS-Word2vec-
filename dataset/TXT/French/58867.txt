The level of detail and care that goes into everything from the service to the food is mind blowing. The restaurant has a beautiful view of the Bellagio Fountains, but the interior is so gorgeous and the food is so delicious that you hardly notice them. We started our evening with a creme brûlée martini, which was perfect in every way. The amuse bouche was a salmon rillette and it was Heaven. I started with the beef tartare, which absolutely melted in your mouth. My entree was the sea bass, which was fantastic, but I will admit that my dinner date's rabbit was life changing. I finished the evening with the chocolate soufflé, which is by far the most amazing dessert I've ever had. 

I really wish we had taken the opportunity to return, if only for drinks. It seems like a sin to visit an establishment more than once during a quick trip to Las Vegas, but I could have dined here every day and it wouldn't have been enough.
