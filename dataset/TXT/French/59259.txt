rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w A co-worker and  Vegas local recommended this fabulous restaurant as a great place to celebrate a birthday with that special someone.  The staff was very professional, courteous and sincere.  I felt at ease the moment I was treated by the hostess.

The waiter made a few recommendations and since it was our first time, we took him up on his offer.  The meal was fantastic!  The attention to detail was 99% on point.  I recommend the Kobe beef and foie gras...they will both melt in your mouth.

I'll certainly return for another special occasion.  The only thing that threw me off was the signing of the bill.  I was expecting something nicer than a .50 cent pen to sign a $500+ bill.  May be next time.  Enjoy!
