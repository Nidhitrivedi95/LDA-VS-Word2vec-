xcmmTXhuMx2fZF2Bt69F4w I've been couple of times trying first one of there salad and then the second time a steak. 
It was really good and well proportioned food. I would say that what i like the most is that they don't put too many artifacts in their meal and they try to keep it simple. 

One not-so-good point would be their cocktail but that's not a cocktail bar!
