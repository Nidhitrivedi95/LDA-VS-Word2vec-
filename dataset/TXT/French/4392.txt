The first visit was late night for a couple of drinks and a bite to eat.  The second visit was for a longer lunch.  On both visits we sat at the counter which was great.  The service was very good and it was actually really enjoyable to watch the staff at work.  The older man behind the bar late night was mixing up some great classic cocktails for us.  He was very nice and funny as well.

The food was delicious and felt simple and homey.  The best part of the place was just how relaxed it was.  It felt like you could relax there for as long as you wanted and you would never feel rushed or pressured to leave. This was such a nice change from New York where it sometimes feels like they are trying to turn the table over as soon as you sit down.  It was extremely comfortable here.  We will definitely be back on our next visit!
