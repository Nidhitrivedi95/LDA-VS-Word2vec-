O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q I was in town visiting and was looking for a fancy romantic restaurant that would have good food and also stay open late. Since we were watching a show that ended at 8:45, we didn't have many options. Plus Morels was also the only place that had absolutely no wait time. In fact, I think I only saw a handful of tables that were occupied, which at first hand doesn't look like a good sign. We look pass that and since my date had never been here either, we decided to stay. The server was very nice and helpful trying to guide us through the menu pointing out the right things to choose from. We ended up splitting a salad and a steak, and also got the mac & Cheese, you can not forget about the mac and cheese. Next time I am in Vegas I will absolutely be back here just for the mac and cheese even if I am not in the mood for a steak. The steak was really good and they even carved it for us. They brought out three different types of salt to rub on the steak but I preferred it without the salt. it didn't really need anything. Just make sure you get it cooked medium. The salad is where I have to knock off a star though. There was three pieces of lettuce and a few very small chopped cucumbers and a couple very very small shrimps in there. Wish I had taken a picture to show the size. For the price of the salad, you'd expect a nice fulfilling salad. I think I will skip it next time and recommend others skipping it as well. Other then that, everything was great, it is a romantic restaurant so definitely a place you would take a date. The prices are on the higher end, but I don't mind spending money on good food and good alcohol. Unfortunately, we had no additional room for any dessert, but maybe next time since The Venetian is my go to hotel to stay at.
