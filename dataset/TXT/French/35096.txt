HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw This was Frenchie night number 2... I chose this place after hearing the many reviews of the sister restaraunt in LA, and of Chef David Myers.

We got the 5 course tasting menu...two of us had the wine pairing - prices were decent for a prix fixe - $75 w/o vino 115 w/ vino.

Scenery - decent view of the strip. We were located a couple of tables down and the view from the restaraunt was pretty nice, but we are spoiled. I always try to get a view of the strip when I stay at the Cosmopolitan, so seeing it from 40-60 floors up on a balcony is spoiling, but for first timers (not dates) you will love the view. I say no dates, because you get caught up if you like people watching the LV strip.

First and foremost - me and my gf were Frenchied out from the night before but this was French Food Las Vegas weekend so...getting into the menu:

We had the autumn Prix Fixe and yes it was varied.

Pairing were ok, nothing spectacular especially after many of my LA friends said to go to the one in LA. I can say one dish did not amaze me and that was a swordfish. I am picky about my fish and was surprised as this stood out from the rest of the dishes. It just wasnt that good. Plain, heavy, and was not complemented by the Riesling that they served with it.

The other plates were decent but we ate at Robuchon the night before... so that completely jaded our French experience!
