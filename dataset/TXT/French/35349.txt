Ht-_i0UAq7YDBaqJwcQMdQ Chasse et Peche is a solid French restaurant in old town.  It was a good meal and while I felt happy with the experience I have to say there are better, more innovative restaurants in Montreal to dine (Europea, XO Le Restaurant).  That said, if you're looking for something good in old town, you can't go wrong here.  What I had:

- Crab two ways with Alsatian Pinot Blanc
- Lamb Carpaccio waffle with Barolo
- Wild Boar two ways with Barolo
- Frozen maple syrup parfait topped by chocolate chips, with Sclavus muscat de Cephalonie "vin doux du Soleil" 2011
