Starting off, I ordered the salad of the day.  It was a beet salad, and I hate beets.  But this was amazing....came with goat cheese and covered in a delicious dill sauce, and I can't get over how tasty it was.  

My entree and dessert were equally good, the service was very attentive and friendly, and this is a must-eat. I just wish I lived in Montreal so I could visit frequently.  Chez Chose will live in my dreams until next time.
