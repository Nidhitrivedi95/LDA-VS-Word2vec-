ovtlrcsVRlgZZQUlHs_ovw I was really excited to try this place since I am a French food fan. The food was hit or miss, I unfortunately ordered the misses. My dad ordered the filet mignon and really liked it. My mom also really liked the French onion soup. I did not like the ahi starter the fish just wasn't fresh enough. I also had the foie gras torchon witch was underwhelming with minimal weird sauce and toast. I tried the potatoes author gratin that was enjoyable. I just was hoping for a better experience. The people were really nice but the other tables around us were having issues with the food being incorrect and there were flies on the inside restaurant so overall not great atmosphere.
