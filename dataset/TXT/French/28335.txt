EEIz44ewHhOKmfTloAK13g I took my husband for his birthday dinner after reading all the rave reviews online. The service was excellent, there is no question about that. I'm sorry to say however, but neither of us found the food to be extraordinary. We found many of the dishes to be plain, or had a combination flavours that weren't complementary to each other. I'm by no means a food connoisseur, my husband and I just eat out a lot and we love good food. And the food was okay, but I don't think here was anything in particularly special or memorable about it. I think for $95 per person, it's actually on the cheaper end for what you get but don't be jaded by the hype and reviews about the food... it's good, but not great. Sorry.
