SJo_IjvzdRtCvZVN0cbrRQ It's not much of a looker from the outside, but it teaches you not to judge a book by its cover. Once you get inside, it's warm and inviting. The staff were amazing and the food was absolutely divine. Our dining party went with the chef's tasting menu and every course was amazing. However, the dessert course was very inventive, but it missed the mark. I will definitely go back!
