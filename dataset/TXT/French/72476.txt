XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q Easily the best meal of my life, the 16 course tasting menu was completely over the top.  You do not go there to pay for food.  You go there and pay for the experience.

Upon entering the restaurant, the hostess greeted me by name.  How she knew who I was creeped me out a bit, but it did make me feel special.  We were seated immediately in their "garden" area.

I could go into mouth-watering detail about very morsel, but it'd be easier just to tell you what surprised me about this place:

1.  The plating seemed to be designed specifically for each dish (and probably was).  There were several patterns that at first looked like part of the plate until I realized it was made out of food.  Astounding.

2.  2 bites of 16 courses will fill you up.  By the 9th, I was already stuffed.  If I ever do this type of endurance eating, I will only eat a bite or two of each dish.

3.  Many of the wait staff spoke French.

4.  The food was all extremely rich and almost everything had truffles or gold leaf (or both) in it.

Finally, after that meal, I could have used a hot dog for my next meal.  Or, a bucket of KFC.
