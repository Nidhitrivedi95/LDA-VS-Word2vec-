33Tr0eRki1Yamzleu4GMdw They don't have nonfat or 2% milk... I get it, they're trying to be authentic. But it still sucks a little because I get the nonfat latte so I can enjoy their amazing pastries.  So, I opted for an iced ceylon tea "with a little milk".  What I ended up with was slightly tinted water/milk combo that was delivered to me in less than two minutes. My point in telling you that - you have to STEEP the tea. It's part of the whole "tea preparing process"... (uh, what happened to being 'authentic'?)  OK... so I won't get "to go" anything from there anymore except pastries.  But I will definitely be back because, again, AMAZING PASTRIES.
