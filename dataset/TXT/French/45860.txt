mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q Very good food, but not memorable.  We declined the tasting menu because 4 or 5 of the dishes had foie gras - nothing against it, but I think my stomach would have exploded.  I stuck with the small plates, all of which were very well executed.  The crab royale was my favorite.  My wife got the steak tartare; it was good but we both agreed that the 21 Club's is better.  For desert we had La Pomme, which was fantastic

In many ways this restaurant epitomizes everything wrong with Vegas dining.  The waiter felt obliged to tell us that the steak tartare was raw.  The couple next to us spent a lot of time photographing their food and ours.  Robuchon wandered through the restaurant whereupon he was fawned upon by several diners.  It could be that my expectations were too high - at Robuchon's Paris place my friend had rabbit cooked in its own blood - so the menu seemed less adventurous than I expected
