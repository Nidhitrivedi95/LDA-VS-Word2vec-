jalA5zHW8ZfY3RSPG7oDxQ It is a nice cute place.  The feel of a small, family owned, traditional restaurant is certainly a plus.  However, the food was nothing very special (even though it was not bad as well).  A negative thing is that it took quiet some time to get our food after the order.  Bottom line, I would go back but not with my own initiative.
