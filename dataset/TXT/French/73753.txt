I loved everything about this place, and was so, so, so glad we decided to splurge here on our last night in Vegas. With no Res, we came up the elevator, gave our names and only had to wait about 15 minutes at the bar before we had a seat. The bartender was hilarious & sweet, and the hostess carried our wine over and seated us in a large, plush booth. 

The view = incredible. This place is mid-way up the faux Eiffel Tower, facing the Bellagio - so we got to see the water show more than a few times while we ate. 

The food = even more incredible. We started off with the Blue Cheese Soufflé Pudding, Walnut Pecan Petite Salad. Holy god, that was good. For entrees, we had the Aged New York Steak, Braised Celery Heart, Bone Marrow, Cabernet Reduction and the Filet of Sea Bass, Fingerlings, Double Smoked Bacon, Crispy Potato, Petit Mache. Plus, we shared the Potato Gratin. It was all AMAZING. And they aren't messin' around with the portions. Everything was as filling as it was delicious. 

To finish off, the special Eiffel Tower Soufflés in Chocolate and Raspberry. They take 30 minutes to make, so we had the foresight to order them before our meal and they were just perfect. The waiter does this fancypants thing where he pours the cream and chocolate into them at your table and they get all big & fluffy. mmm. MMMM. 

The topper: our *very* French waiter was great! Constantly checked up on us, made funny jokes, and didn't even blink when I spilled water all over the table. In fact, he moved us to another! 

All in all - just the best. I would for sure splurge to go here again. It was romantic and beautiful and I left completely satisfied.
