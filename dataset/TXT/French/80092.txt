Extremely cramped space but wonderfully attentive & friendly staff who try their best to cater to their customers in the space they have to work with.  Menu was simple & straightforward.  The food tasted fresh and the price was fantastic!  I got the hamburger avec fromage and added the poutine & salade.  The gravy on the poutine was savory and delightful.  The hamburger hit the spot.

My husband got the BLT and really enjoyed it - commented on how good the bread was.  We also got an extra order of the vegetable poutine. 

Everyone eating in there was happy - super chill vibe.  Lovely place - we would definitely come back if we were looking for a simple little sandwich & poutine fix.
