UxWH8zRYIBgs6Q2oykvRdw the french onion soup was the best i have ever tasted in my life. According to the waiter they make the beef broth overnight. I tasted a hint of sherry in the broth. The only reason i am not giving 5 stars is that i feel that french onion soup should be vegetarian so using beef broth feels like cheating and is really why it does not taste like any of the ones i tasted. That being said i would come here every night if i could just for this soup!
