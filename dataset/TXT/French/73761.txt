xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g We went to Vegas for my wife's birthday past weekend. We decided to go here for the brunch since we weren't staying in Vegas for the entire weekend. Yes it was still expensive, especially we decided to order Appetizer and desert, but with impeccable service and food, I thought it was worth of every penny especially if you add the view looking over Bellagio and Vegas Strip. My wife thought that creamy french onion soup was one of the best soup she ever had, and my Eggs Benedict was excellent! I will try dinner next time!
