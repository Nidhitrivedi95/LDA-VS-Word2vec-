ITde2CeOZ6fUG9h3xb-Nag Arrived promptly at 7:30 for a reservation for two.  We were told nothing was available and the noncaring receptionist wouldn't even give us an estimate of when we might get the table we reserved.  We went to the bar and before ordering spotted the manager/owner.  When we told him of this situation he offered us two seats at a "community table" of twelve.  Certainly not what we were interested in.  You would think that he might have had the smarts to offer us a glass of wine.  Quite frankly he didn't seam to care.  So, we left and went to Hyde Park for a great memorable meal.
