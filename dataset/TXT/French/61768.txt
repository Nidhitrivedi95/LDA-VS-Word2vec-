sphMzEIqY1I2Dzv3zLZY2g I sooooooo wanted to give this restaurant 5 stars but I just couldn't because of location.  Which I will touch on at the end.  First, the food!

She Crab Soup:  10/10  The chef is a Charleston native and apparently prides himself on this dish.  Well... bravo, my friend.  I will be back many-a-times for this alone.  

Fresh Bread/Cheese:  6/10  You might think this is weird to add this in the review but I thought it was pretty cool that they made fresh butter/cheese every night with their own twist.  It just so happen that cream cheese and dill was below average to my pallet.

Pork Tenderloin:  9/10  Succulent! Delicious tender pieces of pork laid over a risotto to die for... Worth a 2nd, 3rd, possibly 4th order in a row.  

Additionally, they have a wide selection of local micro brews which always pushes you up on my list.  Great job, guys.  Only problem.... Located back in the middle of a corporate park well off the beaten path.  Just odd.  But a good find if you venture there.  

Enjoy!!
