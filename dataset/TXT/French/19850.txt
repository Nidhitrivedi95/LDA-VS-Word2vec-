aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw TLDR - good pastries but not something to seek out specifically

I was expecting more of an actual bakery/store but Bouchon Bakery is more like a small kiosk instead. There's 2 of them in the Venetian - one on the 2nd floor by an entrance to the shops and one on the 1st floor near the food court. 

The selection of pastries is rather small. There's macarons, cookies, croissants and a few other sweets. Nothing fancy or particularly unique or special. Prices are pretty standard for a typical bakery. 

Their cookies and pastries are good and a decent size, but not necessarily something I'd go out of my way to get again. Save your sweet tooth for other things in Vegas. 

My friends and I got a few things to try here:

* CHOCOLATE CHUNK COOKIE ($3.25) - 4/5
Nothing too special but still good. There's definitely a lot of chocolate in it for any chocolate lovers out there

* OATMEAL RAISIN COOKIE ($3.25) - 4/5
If you like oatmeal raisin cookies, theirs is worth a try. It has the perfect balance of crunch and chewiness. Just a slight crunch on the outside for some texture and chewy but not too soft on the inside

* BLUEBERRY CROISSANT ($3.75) - 5/5
My favorite of the pastries! Honestly it looked more like a danish than a croissant since it was pretty flat and had a "filling". It was basically a blueberry muffin in the center and croissant around it. Nice twist on a blueberry muffin! The muffin part was moist and the croissant part was light and airy.
