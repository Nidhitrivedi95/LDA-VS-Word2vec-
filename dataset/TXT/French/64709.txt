teTQU7TIPE0O_B1zN_239w The breakfast was good, good selection, good food. The prices are a little steep for what you get compared to other breakfast places. The service was also a little slow, it took me 20 minutes to get a coffee refill and the place wasn't that busy. Also, when I asked for a box, that took a long time as well. Overall, just average food and service.
