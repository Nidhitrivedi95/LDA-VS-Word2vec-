4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw This review is of our experience and not of the food (we didn't get that far). Had a reservation for lunch - this was a place I was super excited to try out given all the great reviews. We walked in and the whole place reeked of smoke, but it's LV so most things smell of smoke. We were passed off to the girl to seat us and she took us to the little greenroom/sunroom area which was was like a freaking sauna. I asked her to be seated somewhere more shaded and she points to the table next to this one and says we can sit there. Mind you, there is indoor seating, with people sitting indoors, and in the shade. I completely lost it - they had already asked my seating preference at the hostess stand, I had asked for indoor seating - she said sure and took proceeded to take me OUTSIDE.  I just sat because if I opened my mouth any further we were going to have problems. Our waiter approached, took our drink order and we asked for Sweet N Low - and were told that they don't have any - who doesn't have Sweet N Low??!! We, ultimately decided to just leave. Sweat was pouring down our backs and things weren't going well otherwise. Horrible, horrible service experience.......then we had to find somewhere else to eat on a Friday afternoon at lunchtime. Double angry now!
