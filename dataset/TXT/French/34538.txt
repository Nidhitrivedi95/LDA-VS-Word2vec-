HojKatUfX4UHWaPqtl63NQ What a wonderful night at Rivea. Fantastic food, incredible environment and phenomenal service. 

From the moment we stepped up to the elevator until the moment we left, we were surrounded by warm, friendly staff that took a genuine interest in elevating our night. For starters, we enjoyed the Clam Linguine. While a tad on the salty side, the clams were cooked to perfection. For the main course, I had the John Dory and she had the Lobster. Both were fantastic, but the lobster was the clear winner. We finished off the night with a chocolate cake and some vanilla ice cream described by her as "the best ice cream I've ever had." 

An overall very satisfying experience, and one that we both look forward to repeating. We will surely be back!
