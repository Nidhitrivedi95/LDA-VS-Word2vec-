cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg We loved this place so much last year, so we planned another trip back just to go again. This time around, I ordered the Plogue a Champlain. What's a plogue? I had no idea, it's not a Celtic rock band, nor a disease spread by vermin, and the menu omits any description whatsoever. Turns out, it's Quebecois French slang, meaning "plug," as in this dish could clog Lake Champlain. It consists of a pancake bottom layer, topped with potatoes, bacon, melted cheddar, and seared foie gras with a maple syrup sauce. All of the richness just oozes and drips down, soaking into the pancake. Each bite was dense with delicious duck fat, bacon fat, and butter. Thankfully, the portion size was manageable, or else I would have had needed stat angioplasty in the dining room. I had it as my main course, but it could easily be shared as a starter for two. Now I can't wait to go back to try more of the menu. One tip: even if you can't get a reservation, you may have a chance getting a table if there's a no show, or just opt to sit at the bar and watch the cooks at work in the open kitchen.
