Tefx_N6A6nrsdj4jHHnbYg I found the cutest and nicest cafe! I came out here for doctors appointment and stopped in It is so nice ! Pastry was homemade, fresh and delish! The person who waited on me ( might have been the owner) was so helpful and pleasant, couldn't have been any nicer! What a wonderful cafe Next time I'm going to have lunch because it looked fantastic !
