XQhicCTzHbb0trmCnoDiIA Hmm.  My original review of this place has "disappeared".  I'll try again.

Visited here not too-too long ago after reading about the restaurant in the Star I believe.  Interesting interior, but I was excited to try a "French" place in the Peel region (there ain't that many).

Wifey started with the soup du jour - it was...the soup of the day (I can't remember, but she DID like it very much).  I had the foie gras/chicken liver (of course).  Dainty serving, but very nice and light.  The broad had salmon and I had the filet-o-beef.  Salmon was very tasty and surprisingly moist.  My beef was overdone but still very well seasoned, but by the time we were asked how things were, I was done.

After being scolded for not telling staff in time, we were treated to free coffee/espresso while sharing dessert.  Cute little place for Brampton, but there are too many others to visit before returning.
