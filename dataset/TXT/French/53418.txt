QEgfK_TKY8bwK-YzKDdkGw The food was absolutely divine!
They started us off with complementary Gruyere popovers and a smoked trout and roasted onion soup.  We knew we were in for a treat.  
In our party of four we ordered many dishes to share:
Appetizers:
Foie gras- best dish
Stuffed oysters
Duck confit

Salads:
Date salad - incredible
Greens with a soft egg- quite the experience when it breaks and you have a creamy dressing. 

Entrees:
Halibut- soft and flaky
Giant scallops- beautiful with Farro
Trout almandine - amazing coating

Dessert:
Traditional Tarte Tatin

The best restaurant in town!
