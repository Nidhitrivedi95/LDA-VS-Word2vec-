EPb3FWs3mxQLUjGeMNP0SQ My friends and I went here for our last dinner in Montreal! I researched it ahead of time, and made a reservation a week before. It was no issue changing the number of people or the time of the reservation. The restaurant itself is very beautiful. Great ambience and the music was perfect. Our waiter was Gavin (or Kevin, I may have misheard him over the music!). He was super helpful and completed our meal with celebratory shots for my friend as it was her bachelorette weekend! We received our appetizers fairly quickly; the butternut squash soup was amazing. The food took a little while to arrive, but that happens sometimes no matter where you go. We let Gavin know about the food, and he did his best to speed up the process. We would go back again next time we are in town :)
