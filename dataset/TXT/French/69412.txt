wf6cEXlL1qkNGH0-_CjKMw La Petite France is a long way from home for an east-ender lke me.  It is a small, rustic and cozy restaurant that boasts authentic French food.

My experience in coming to these local joints that boast authenticity is that you pay for it in lack of plating and presentation.  I guess they really DO keep it real!

I came here with my BFF for Winterlicious.  If you want hip and trendy - go elsewhere.  The crowd at La Petite France were mostly older.

The service was clumsy.  While there were no big mishaps, we had to politely inform the servers (3 times) that they brought us the wrong order.  Third times a charm?

I opted for the Citrus & Honey Mussels Salad which is basically torn up romaine lettuce, with a few mussels scattered on top and  mixed with a citrus viniagrette.  It definitely didn't have any wow factor to it.  

For mains, I ordered the Shallot Steak with Fries.  The steak was okay, it was a thin slice of steak.  The shallot sauce was yummy and I used it to soak up the yummy French fries (which were also yummy sans sauce).

For dessert I decided to try the Crème Brûlée since I saw them scribble on a chalkboard that it was Toronto's best.  Call me a skeptic!

Was it the BEST crème brûlée I've ever had?  I wouldn't say so.  But it was pretty damn good.  The sugar was hard, but not to a level of stained-glass duress.  It had just the right amount of caramelization without having to bring out the heavy artillery to penetrate the layer of sugar.  The actual custard part was pretty standard.

It should be noted that La Petite France is looking to change its name.  And they are asking for their customers for suggestions.

All in all, a satisfying meal for $35.  But I won't clock the extra kilometres just to come here for a meal.  If I were in the neighbourhood I'd probably come back again.  

I would recommend making reservations as it is a pretty small space.
