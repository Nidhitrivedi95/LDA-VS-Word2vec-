_T7f2wUgNlJqxsR-cR89SQ Called in advance to secure a quiet table and received a great one on arrival, with an amazing view of the skyline at night, we even got lucky enough to see some fireworks at the end. The ambience and decor here are incredible.

I'm a sucker for a great amuse-bouche, and they delivered with a great piece of salmon.

For apps we did the calamari and steak tartare, calamari just being "ok" but the steak tartare was a standout and I highly recommend it.  They offered an off the menu cavatelli pasta app which they split for us which was also very good. I was extremely excited for the swordfish special I ordered but it could have been more moist on the inside and I couldn't help but feel a little disappointed with it. I tried some of the veal sirloin which was wonderfully cooked.


On to dessert!! Coconut cream pie, wow. and The dark chocolate mousse double wow! They were definitely a few more places in Toronto I wanted to try but with only 3 days I couldn't do it all, so overall I'd say this was my best dining experience in Toronto.
