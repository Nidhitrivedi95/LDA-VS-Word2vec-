9OaeSZ-JqYSnOTWP3GD2rg This place is amazing! I went for coffee one day, and I came back from breakfast the following day. The capuccino was really well done both times, at just the right temperature and you could tell good quality coffee was being used. 

For breakfast I ordered a parfait and it was delicious. It's probably the best parfait I've ever had. It was also beautifully presented. 

The staff are really friendly and always attentive to your needs. I'll definitely be going back!
