kKC7UTcHZM3zLfT97x3msg Hello Frank,

If only my kitchen was like yours!
I had such a wonderful evening! 
Five star service and food that was perfection.

I forgot to make a reservation at Woodlot and well, we were hungry and we didn't want to wait an hour.  Frank's was just down the street and even though they were busy, they made room for us! =)

* Bready Bread* 
The olive tapenade was freaking delicious served with Chianti loaf and baby brioche.  I thought the sweet brioche was perfect with the salty olives.

*Amuse Bouche*
I didn't love the chilled potato-leek soup.  I felt like I was drinking salad dressing... However I loved the goat cheese croquette...deep fried, soft and melty on the inside and oh-so-yummy! 
I want more! I love fried cheese. =(

*Seafood Cocktail ($15)*
Cool presentation.... ha, because the seafood is served on a block of ice with a banana leaf!  Big chunks of fresh lobster, shrimp, and crab meat!  I was worried that I would be disappointed with the size of the serving... but I wasn't!

*Sorbets -- Super tart and limey (sour face)

*Elk Loin ($34)*
This main is a good meal on a cooler evening.  It's hearty and heavy!
The elk loin was tender and juicy.  I did wish there was more foie.  =(  There is a quarter sized piece tucked under a morsel of beet ravioli.  The chestnuts-and-foie-gras jus was spectacular though.  

*Molten Chocolate Cake ($8)*
I didn't love the cake.  It was a bit dry... and not... molten enough.
The cherry sorbet was a good pairing with the chocolate... the flavors are like a black forest cake.. (But I sort of don't like black forest cake). 

The food is four star.
But they treat you like royalty and I loved eating here!
The waitstaff took wonderful care of us!  On the way out, all the cooks turned and smiled and said goodbye! 
And you get free homemade mini chocolate truffles?! 
Five stars!
