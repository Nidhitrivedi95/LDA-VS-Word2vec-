1) TONS of beer options (as well as gluten free beer and cider!)
2) prepare to wait....awhile....on the weekends
3) great food!

Brasserie V rocks! The restaurant is located right on Monroe Street. There is a big bar that splits between the two rooms of the restaurant. Like most restaurants in Madison on weekends prepare to wait for a table. Our wait was about 90 mins when we arrived around 7pm on a Saturday. There is full menu service at the bar if you are eagle eyes enough to snag a few bar stools. 

There are TONS of beer options from all over. If you are with a beer connoisseur this is the place for them! There are also hard cider and gluten free beer options. The menu is American with lots of sandwich/burger options, salads, appetizers etc. Gluten free bread from Silly Yak is available to be subbed in. We tried the ham sandwich, a burger and frites. The food was great! 

The Monroe food scene is great and Brasserie V does not disappoint!
