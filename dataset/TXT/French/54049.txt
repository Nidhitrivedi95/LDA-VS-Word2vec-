qTacF-_Iucc1Nxom_Za_5Q This is my favorite brunch spot in Toronto. The best part is that it's somehow never too crowded to get a table, despite how it's clearly the best brunch spot. I feel sorry for all the folks lining up in the cold for inferior food.

Everything I've had for brunch so far has been exceptional. It helps that their menu isn't huge, so I don't have to agonize over decisions. The side dishes that come with most of the brunch options are also weirdly good. They're not just garnishing your plate. My favorite is the fried eggs with duck confit.

They take their coffee seriously. No diner coffee here. Toronto isn't a city for cocktails, but this is one of those places where they get it right.
