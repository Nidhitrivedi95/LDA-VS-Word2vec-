jLxeBgWhLRbII2ACkgH1Sg So my favorite crepe of all time is a ham and Swiss crepe.  Simple yet utterly satisfying.

Le Belle Terre changed everything.  On the menu, they had this same crepe, except it came with a fried egg on top.  I knew I was going to order this dish the second I read it on the menu, but I didn't want to at the same time.  I fear change.  Do I deviate from the norm and order this fancy dish?  Or do I stick with what I know that always satisfies and never lets me down.  Damn you fried egg.  Damn you for challenging me.  But I thank you as well fried egg, because I did order you on top of that crepe.  And you did add even more depth not just into that crepe, but into my life.  Thank you.

What a great place, I will be back.  I would definitely wanna get a quiche knowing the crepes are that good.
