zqNgwQjj0_XAll-neGikIw This place is amazing! Everything is homemade and the flavors are out of this world! They have the best croissants. I am not vegan, but tried their homemade chocolate vegan ice scream and it was the best! I also had the Chicken Normandy for dinner..sooo good! I will definitely be back! I really don't even want to tell anyone about this hidden gem..but oops the secrets out!
