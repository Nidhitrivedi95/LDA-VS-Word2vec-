SFnrHuVFSNiondFVUBLJZQ Gorgeous crepes (made my husband and I feel slightly sick all day afterwards, so not sure what was up with that). My kids liked the pancakes and hot chocolate. Great location in the old port area, near all the touristy shops. But a fun neighborhood to walk around. The fondue was ok - not really worth the space in your belly.
