9ET_RUNztevq4_OLAX80Gg My boyfriend and I came here on Friday for Winterlicious and we both had a great experience! The $45 dinner menu is definitely worth it - portions were good, everything was plated beautifully - and the great service/ambiance made for a wonderfully relaxing date night.

Appetizer:
I ordered the mushroom soup and my boyfriend got the tuna tartare. The soup was definitely one of the highlights of the meal for me - very creamy and savoury without the mushroom flavour being too overwhelming - and the tartare was quite tasty (and fresh) as well. Would recommend both of them.

Main course:
The fish stew was the only dish that I felt could be better; the seafood was cooked nicely but the stew itself was very salty. However, this might just be me (and my unusually low tolerance for salt) as my boyfriend didn't think it was too salty and ended up finishing it for me. I didn't try the lamb that he ordered but he enjoyed it!

Dessert:
Both of the desserts that we ordered (warm madeleines and the savarin) were lovely but I especially liked the madeleines - simple but super yummy, and you get a lot of them too.

Overall, dinner was delicious and it was a great start to Winterlicious - would highly recommend!
