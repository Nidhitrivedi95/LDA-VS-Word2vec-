in3zjiaLpNzr9G3K35gAJQ We went here late, about a half hour before close. The place was packed and the only table available was on the patio. We kind of stood around and they told us we could sit there if we wanted to. We sat down, but there were still other people waiting who apparently didn't want to sit outside. I don't know if we were hard to see or if its just because they were busy, but we waited at least 20 minutes before anyone came to our table. 

I ordered the prix fixe (butternut squash ravioli, beef brisket, and some eclaire type dessert that started with a p). My girlfriend had the pizza with bacon. 

I don't know if its because it is a european style restaurant or what, but every course took forever, it took us two and a half hours to have dinner.

My squash ravioli in creme sauce was amazing, but there were literally only two of them. 

The croissant basket that we received was ok, they were a little burned.

The beef brisket was awful. It was soaked in some kind of sauce that reminded me of gym socks. I would not order it again. The veggies on the side were lightly cooked, very little seasoning, and very fresh, these were great.

My girlfriend said her pizza was ok, but not anything special. 

The dessert is what really stole the show. I have no idea what mine was called (it started with a P and was really long, I couldn't pronounce it), but dear god it was amazing. I could have eaten a meal of just that. 

They did bring my girlfriend a small brownie with ice cream as well, which she appreciated. 

I don't know if we would go back if this is a typical dinner experience. Maybe just get dessert to go.
