ovtlrcsVRlgZZQUlHs_ovw We're fresh off the boat from the Bay Area, and this is as close to "San Francisco quality" that you can get this far West of Phoenix. We were so impressed with the menu, the service, and the food quality. Our waiter, Jason, was the utmost professional and had quick answers to our questions. When the food arrived, they brought us a side order of brussels sprouts instead of plantains, but they quickly fixed the error and brought out a rush order of perfectly caramelized plantains. Plantains are hard to get right in the best of conditions, let alone under 4 minutes. Amazing.

Now I need to talk about the Vogue Burger. This is one of the best burgers I've had since leaving California. You don't need to modify it in the slightest. The Vogue Fries stayed hot and crispy throughout the meal.

While there's a lovely patio, the restaurant itself is pretty small and table-full, so I'd say it's not ideal for private, intimate conversations. But if you're there for good friends and great food, I've yet to do better.

Side note for Michigan folks: they carry Bell's Two Hearted.
