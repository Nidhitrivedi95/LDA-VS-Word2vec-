j9d1c73emq6sL0v5IfrC-w We went on a Sunday evening, when they have a crazy good deal with three courses for $22. Each plate we tried - and with a table of four we tried nearly everything available - was delectable and exciting. The contrast of the corn in the lobster bisque was mindblowing. The service was top notch. I don't know how they manage to pull it off, but it was full when we went so I imagine the great deals coupled with the volume makes it possible. So nice to see a restaurant living up to its potential!
