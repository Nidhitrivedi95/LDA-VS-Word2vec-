HojKatUfX4UHWaPqtl63NQ Went to a dinner in one of the private dining rooms and it was fantastic! Started with a wonderful seafood crostini and tasty salad. I think the best course (and the best I have ever had) was a gnocchi with the most fabulous light sauce( sorry but I cannot remember what kind). They practically melted in your mouth and the sauce was perfect! Next was a perfectly cooked scallop with another wonderful sauce and some winter vegetables. The final dinner course was a small filet with an au jus that was tender and really flavorful, but I was so full I could not finish it. Finally a flourless chocolate torte which was outshines by the most phenomenal ice cream. They have redecorated since it was Mix and the atmosphere is much warmer with the addition of wood - a change from the previous cool stark white decor. I assume a meal in the restaurant from the menu would be just as wonderful. Because it is on the top floor of the Delano the views were beautiful!
