TcWlYyRE_qggTBAutEfSoQ I am not someone that eats in fine dining establishments regularly.  I was lucky enough to visit this establishment and WOW!  It is unreal.
From the general atmosphere they create that is very welcoming to the food on the plate which I can safely say I have tasted no better!
The Keg is one place I like to go to that will cost you a few dollars more than the norm and I love The Keg.  
This establishment tops The Keg hands down.  It is also on the same price level as it.  
Truly loved it and would go again.
