4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw When I come to Vegas, I always pay a visit to Mon Ami Gabi. I make sure to make reservations, and even then there is often a small wait. This place has a beautiful view of the Bellagio fountain show from the patio. The inside seating is more classy and formal. Service is excellent. They even come around to scrape the bread crumbs off the table.

I always order the filet mignon with red wine reduction sauce, which is one of the best I've eaten anywhere. It is so soft and melts in your mouth. It comes with a generous side of frites as well, which are pretty good, but nothing too special. My parents got the lobster tail, which was so fresh and sweet. Their caramelized scallops appetizer is to die for as well.
