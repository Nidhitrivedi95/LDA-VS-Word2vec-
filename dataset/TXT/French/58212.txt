rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A This place was amazing. Our waitress was great and on the ball. The bread they give you is amazing. We got the duck confit for an appetizer as well as a cheese plate. Both very good. My beet salad was fresh. My husband got the steak and fries and I had the lamb. I would come back here for sure!
