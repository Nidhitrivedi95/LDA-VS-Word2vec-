EXAbfr5PkoRzMqlCb_3ALQ I've been on a mission to try new(ish), interesting, and non-chain establishments - so our visit to Trente-Cinq totally fit the bill.  We started at Lisa G's, but the menu was underwhelming for dinner, so we walked the twenty paces across the parking lot to this hip looking spot.  

First off, the decor is right out of Ikea - literally, the mirrors, lighting, and "art" were all from Ikea.  (What did all these businesses do before Ikea opened in Tempe??)  which I suppose isn't so bad in itself, but there just didn't seem to be any point of view and the design was simply ho-hum.

The food was good, but not "oh-my-God" good.  I certainly could live without visiting there again.  I can't say that I am a Belgian food aficionado (or that I even comprehend Belgian food) - certainly someone who has been to Belgium might very well appreciate the menu more than me.  The table next to us was quite taken with their choices which were decidedly more Belgian that what we were eating.

I wish that I could say more positive things about the place - anyone who tries something new in Phoenix should be applauded.
