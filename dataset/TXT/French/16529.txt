8ciT6qjI18x9EPtOb-gqYQ Pleasantly surprised! Chilean sea bass as well as both of the tarts were wonderful. We brought our two and six year old along and they were extremely accommodating. Great dishes with the exception of one of the salads which was a bit over salted. The place itself is very quaint and the host was warm and understanding of our children and their needs for crayons and such. Would love to return.
