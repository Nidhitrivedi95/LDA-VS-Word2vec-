oPGUbqBpHNZvVu9gAFJbMQ As I've noticed in Montreal, the decor was amazing. A tower of skipping stones, art drawn on the walls, and written beneath it "From wine what sudden friendship springs," a quote they love enough to print on all of the wine glasses.

The bread was wonderfully soft with a crunchy crust. It's always a good sign when you ask for more bread and don't feel like you're wasting your appetite. Our waitress was very friendly, and we received a small spoonful of their tomato soup to try. As to the main courses, the grilled Arctic char was very flavorful, and the provencal halibut was delicious in a garlic sauce.

Unfortunately, those were the items my dining partners ordered. I received the poached salmon with hollendaise sauce and a salad on the side. The greens tasted a little unwashed, but not enough to ignore. The few bites of broccoli and cauliflower were blander than I expected. And apparently poaching a salmon is a good way to drain some of the taste. I tried using the hollendaise to give it some flavor, but the sauce wasn't very exciting as well. I'll never leave salmon uneaten, but I wouldn't order that dish again.

It's a nice restaurant, and I would give the wait staff 4 stars, but overall this is a 3.5, rounded down for the multitude of restaurant choices in Montreal.
