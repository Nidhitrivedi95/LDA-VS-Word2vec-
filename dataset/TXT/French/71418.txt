xcmmTXhuMx2fZF2Bt69F4w Point Brugge is amazing.  I ended up there for my first time after I was turned away by the Cafe at the Frick and got lost on my way home (it happens).  I had the burger on my first trip (perfectly cooked, and delicious) but every time since I've gotten the moules, which are outstanding.  The curry sauce is my favorite - it is so flavorful.  Service is prompt and friendly, and the space, as others have pointed out, is inherently comforting and neighborhood-y.  Highly recommended for locals and people visiting Pittsburgh who want a break from the Primantis of this town.
