Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA Came here for a fun date night because I received a dining credit from work for $50. We didn't come very dressed up (jeans and a nice top), so right away our waiter was cold towards us. We ordered a few drinks but they tasted like there wasn't any alcohol in it, so I asked the waiter if he could bring me a new drink because this one taste too sweet, he took the drink back without an apology and brought me a smaller glass with the drink...and charged me for TWO drinks even thought i had only taken 2 sips of my first drink. Our food was fantastic but when we went to pay for the check and handed him the dining credit he gave us a dirty look and walked away. When we got our check back he had already added on his tip, assuming we wouldn't tip him well...he gave himself a nice tip of $25 for a $150 meal. Even though the food was good, the service and snooty looks were enough to never have me come back! Also, it was hard finding this place! Had to walk around for 30 minutes to find out you have to take secret elevators to get here. No thanks! Just because I live in Vegas and can't drop $300 on a nice meal doesn't mean I deserved to be treated like that.
