BSmqxPbQglQwP2R56OqOag I'm so disappointed at this place. After a long drive back from the Grand Canyon, My party of 4 decided to come here for dinner after reading these great reviews. We were thirsty and starving. We should have just went to jack in the box. Let's start off with the service. We came at 8:30 and the dining room was pretty empty because it was almost closing time. You would think that because it's empty, service will be great but that was not the case. We sat down and 15 minutes passed, no waiter came by to give us water. I finally saw the host going to the kitchen and pointing at our table and our waiter finally came over 5 mins later. 

So we ordered our food and when it came, our water glass was empty but it was never refilled again. My seafood linguine was good but it didn't have any mussels in there. There was 3 clams, 2 shrimps, 1 scallops and some calarami (yes I counted them) and the portion was small. I was still hungry afterward. What pissed me off was that our waiter never came once to check on us and ask us how our food was or to give us water. We finally asked for our check and just left. 

My friend lives 5 mins away from this restaurant but I'm Not sure if I'll give this place another chance or even recommend it to her.
