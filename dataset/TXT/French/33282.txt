hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA Just had lunch here 20 minutes ago and already have to write a review (I enjoyed it that much). 

Background info: I just moved here from NJ/NYC and have an obsession with croissants. My friend recommended this place to me... and as I'm searching yelp for nearby lunch options, I notice my office is a mile away.

Now, back to the actual review. Service and cleanliness, top notch. Food... AMAZING. Had the pesto sandwich on a croissant (of course I would). Each bite was perfect. So perfect that for dessert, I ordered ANOTHER croissant (plain this time, but just as good). Looking forward to trying other options on their menu.

Shout out to Oliver for the friendly service. The only downer? Food so good, forgot to take a picture. And if you didn't post it on the #gram, did you really eat?
