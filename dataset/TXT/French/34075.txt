hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA Was meeting here for a book club and hadn't eaten beforehand. I decided to try the ham and Swiss croissant, it was delicious. I also had a bite of my grandma's roasted vegetable quiche, which she and I both thought was fantastic. Iced tea that tastes right is hard to find, but theirs was some of the best I've had. Their cafe mocha was good as well. Overall very nice.
