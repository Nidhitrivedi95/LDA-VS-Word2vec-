C3PVq7UpeHd6nz1_e-AtkA Love the decor (scored the back booth in the front room)! Menu is great with lots of interesting selections. Had the half scroll #6 - no cheese. the chick pea flour flat bread is basically like a roti. It was SO delicious and creamy tasting when I took my first bite, I had to call the server over to make sure they'd left out the cheese (they had, it was delicious horseradish mayo). My lunch companion had the nanette #3 which was good but a tad salty. Had the raspberry rhubarb pie for dessert - it was good. Definitely will bring boyfriend back here.
