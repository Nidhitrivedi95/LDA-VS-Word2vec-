jLxeBgWhLRbII2ACkgH1Sg First of all this place is quality. Everything I've ordered is quality and consistently excellent. I'm a regular customer here and am glad to continue coming. Everyone I've brought here has been pleased. The variety of pastries is really beyond what you would find at most places. They range from super rich to subtle and the breaded pastries are crispy and soft not overly crunchy and sticky like I've found at other places. This place is great for breakfast and even better for lunch. The outdoor area is comfortable and quiet as the parking lot is not super busy. I recommend the eggs Benedict for breakfast and the crock madam for lunch. The order times are quick for the fresh meals. I recommend strongly.
