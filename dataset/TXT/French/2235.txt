I had their 5-course tasting menu menu but opted for the kobe steak special they had that day as my main course.  It was an extra $120, but it was worth it.  The sommelier was very helpful and assisted us in picking out a white wine that we all thoroughly enjoyed.  Also, I shamelessly gobbled up the olive bread that they kept bringing around.
