Dcj69NZJnbJhK-YHP_nULA Not too much I can add that hasn't already been said. One major positive worth noting:

Brasserie V is the only place I've seen in Madison that regularly offers appropriately-priced small pours of their tap beers (four ounces). This is GREAT - it allows one to try the well-curated Belgian ales and other beers without having to commit to a full pint of something with strong flavor or that is high alcohol. I wish every place with unique tap beers did this, as I'm able to try more styles and still have my wits about me.

Come for the beer, stay for the frites.
