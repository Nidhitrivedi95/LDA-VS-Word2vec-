After all the reviews I'd read about this bistro, I was tre excited to try it out. The atmosphere was so lively and French! We were immediately seated because of my reservation, and our table was perfect.

We started with the foie gras, which was purely delicious. Then both of us ordered the raviolis. OMG, to die for! The sauce alone was worth scraping the bowl with bread, and the tender meat filling in the ravioli was bliss!

We ended the meal with the apple tarte a la mode.......perfect, perfect, perfect.

The service was slow, but friendly and thorough, so we loved our l-oooong meal. Do yourself a favor and go!
