DOmVF9YKOvTkqjcgUwtOgQ My wife and I discovered Le Pois Penche while touring in Montreal because it was near our hotel.  Even though the meal was a bit expensive, we benefited from a positive currency exchange rate.  The restaurant is conveniently located on a corner near the art museum.
The service was attentive and courteous.  It was a bit strange that, about 3/4 of the way through our meal, our server told us that his shift had ended.  However, the new server stepped right in without missing anything.
The wine list is extensive.  The sommelier suggested a good Sauvignon Blanc from the inexpensive part of the list- about $70 CA.  The least expensive wine bottle was $60.
The cheese plate we had as our appetizer had three, large servings of different types of fromage.  All were delicious.
I had a veal T-bone, which was perfectly cooked.  It came with green beans.  Unlike the perception of stingy French dishes, this dish was more than enough to eat.
This is a great restaurant to enjoy a Montreal fine dining experience.
