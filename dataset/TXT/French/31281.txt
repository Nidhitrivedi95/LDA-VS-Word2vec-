gh6__q2WXFuyN8gt6VAnWw Monday afternoon I decided I wanted a change of pace and stopped this absolutely wonderful hidden gem in Las Vegas.  The staff and owner were so incredibly warm and friendly.  I started with the delicious sangria and the flaming Chorizo sausage with the homemade pripri sauce accompaniment. . Nice crisp and very flavorful! 
The owner explained that everything is scratch cook to order fresh so I plan on a long and enjoyable dining experience.
The next items I enjoyed was the chicken livers that were very moist and tender with the Sautee red onions and wine reduction.
The algarve shrimp tails caught me off guard. great flavor the lovely cheese and white wine reduction is a great compliment to be able to stimulate my palate I wasn't expecting it to be as smooth as it was.

I throughly enjoyed my dining experience here and will be back during the lively dinner hours...
