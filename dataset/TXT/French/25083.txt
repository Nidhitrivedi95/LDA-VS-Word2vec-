I went with my husband thinking that this was going to be one of the best dinners we would have on our trip. Boy were we disappointed.  The service was awful. Waiters and waitresses were running around the restaurant all night.   We had to to move tables after they sat us near the waitress station. Which ultimately didn't matter, as the restaurant was so loud and rowdy.  

The food was like bad wedding food.  We had the gnocci and tuna tartar appetizer. Eh.  The cod was awful as was the wagyu.  We complained to both the manager and general manager.  They offered us free dessert, but after such a horrendous meal, we passed.  

For such a "fancy" restaurant, the dress attire was not existent.  People were in flip flops and shorts. Definitely not a quality restaurant, and not worth the money.

Save your money and time.  There was nothing enjoyable about our dinner.  We would have had better luck gambling the money than wasting it on this meal.  There are better restaurants to try on the strip.

Its an embarrassment that Alain Ducasse has his name on this restaurant.
