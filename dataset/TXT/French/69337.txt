Wb9VqNZCq-ZgIlhb4ZDT5A Excellent food, expertly prepared, specially the Ris de Veau (sweetbread). Everything we ordered tasted great, (onglet, the fish of the day, beef tongue, gnocchi Poutine, octopus appetizer) and they were all presented with fresh accompaniments and delicate combinations. Service was also excellent. My husband and I went twice to this restaurant and it's becoming one of our favorites in Montreal.
