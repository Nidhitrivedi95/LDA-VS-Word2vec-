HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw Came for dessert.  Had the cream puffs, cream brulee, and pot de creme (chocolate).  Very basic desserts, but the cream puffs really took the cake.  Topped with a "sugar sponge," vanilla ice cream, and a chocolate sauce - really quite yummy.

But the best part of the restaurant is the view.  The walls are floor to ceiling glass, so any seat is a good seat.  But the best really is the outdoor patio.  There are heat lamps, so no worries about being too cold...  Good photo op.

Waitress was super nice and friendly.  Patient with our large group.  Staff was very helpful with the heat lamps.  Have no complaints.
