It's a cute little café but the food definitely is their biggest charm. Everything I've tried, from their Almond, Chocolate and butter Croissants to their Madeleine's and Canele's have been outstanding but I'd have to say my favorite here is the Nord Sandwich. Smoked Salmon, red onions, cucumber and capers with homemade spread on a pretzel roll made in house. Oh myyyy! My head is spinning just thinking about all the deliciousness in one bite, perfectly pairs with the side salad it comes with.

Also note worthy are their latte's and specialty drinks. There are a lot of varieties they offer and seems like the list gets longer every time I come in. Drinks that will surely appease the coffee fanatics and comes with fancy latte art to boot! C'mon, tell me a Nutella S'mores latte does not stop you in your tracks?!?! You had me at Nutella! The last sip? WOW.

4 stars because there are more goodies I need to get my paws on like the Quiche Lorraine, macarons and various French pastries because where else would you try it but a legit French owned bakery right? Now if only I can find balance and exercise more lol! There's a lot to be said about this place but you just have to try it for yourselves, what are you waiting for?!?! GO!
