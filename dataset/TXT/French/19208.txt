aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw Napa is just a hop skip and a jump away from the bay area...but it was in Vegas that I first sampled anything Thomas Keller related.  Bouchon Bakery was so ideally located...right as you get off the elevator of at the Venetian, it's there to say good morning to me everyday and greets me on my way back up too.  =) On my last day I bought 2 red velvet cupcakes to bring back on my flight home.  Luckily it survived and was still as divine as ever.  The unique characteristic of this red velvet cupcake is the extra cream cheese filling they put inside...like a jelly donut.  Cleaver...if i wanted a cupcake w/ my cream cheese...Regardless of the overload, the cake part was soft and perfectly moist.  Well worth the $3.50 each.  

A great introduction to Mr. Keller's empire...

French Laundry- I will meet you too some day.
