SJo_IjvzdRtCvZVN0cbrRQ Fantastic lunch and breakfast. Not the cheapest lunch but high quality food and filling portions. The Cuban sandwich was delicious and the French influenced crepes were fun. Outdoor seating. We'll be back. We lived in Paris so it's rare to find a place in Ohio that feels a bit like France. This is it. Great coffee and drinks too!
