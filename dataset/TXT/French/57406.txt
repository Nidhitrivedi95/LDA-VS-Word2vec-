rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I came here on my last day at Las Vegas for a trade show. I was really craving for french toast. So I got the Bouchon French Toast which is not your typical french toast from other restaurant. It was bread pudding style with warm layers of brioche, custard & apples served with maple syrup. The sweetness of the dish was perfect. I wanted more after I finished it. I started eating off my friend's Breakfast Americano dish. His dish was a good deal - two eggs any syle served with bacon, country sausage, pommes frites & toasted brioche include your choice of a breakfast pastry, fresh juice & Bouchon blend coffee. I finished his pastry. I was on a carb and sugar load =). Also, Bouchon was too good to be leaving not feeling full.
