rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w Stuffy and pretentious. That's how I would like to start this review. Be warned! The wait staff had the nerve to talk sh*t about a friend that was having a great (loud) time at our table in French. Little did they know that 2 people including myself spoke French so we became louder and stayed WAY beyond our welcome. I didn't see any other table drop $$$ on Caviar or Magnums so why tell our table to behave? Other than that, the meal was good. My favorite from the tasting menu is the Canard & Foie Gras. For $300 a head, go to Picasso instead.
