I did not get a chance to sit inside, but the side 'patio' was nice as well. I was expecting to get a cold from sitting there, but they have 3 big heat lamps which made it very cozy, even a jacket wasn't necessary! However, my neck was burning since I was right under it... which made it a bit uncomfortable. The tables were literally right beside each other, but that's nothing new for a brunch place. 

The wait time was 12 minutes. Just a heads up the line died down at 1:45pm.

As usual, I ordered my eggs benedict with smoked salmon. The good about this dish was that the smoked salmon was not very salty compared to other places and it was accompanied by a huge salad with the right amount of dressing and soft warm french baguette with a huge slab of butter! My eggs were not perfectly poached...which dissapointed me greatly because I get a thrill cutting eggs open and just seeing that river of golden yolk pour out with no solids. Oh well, the hollondaise was good as well. Another thing that bothered me was the celery underneath the eggs... it had a tangy taste to it which, I'm neutral about but could do without. 

The two girls beside us asked for a dessert display and by god, it looked absolutely mouth-watering and heavenly. I wanted to push the guy aside and just grab all the damn pastries and run for it.

After my meal, I headed inside to check out the showcase of pastries. There are danishes/croissants/tarts/different breads which all looked delectable, but I was pretty damn full from my meal. But no worries, 'cause I will be back.

Overall:      I've already made my mind up for what to order next. QUICHE and either a chocolate croissant or danish. YUMMAY.
