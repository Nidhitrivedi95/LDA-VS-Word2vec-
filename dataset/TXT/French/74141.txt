xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g I'll admit, I was dubious about eating dinner at a replica of the Eiffel Tower and dining with a view of the Bellagio fountains instead of the Seine. But reviews for the Eiffel Tower restaurant were positive so I decided to give it a chance. I had an early reservation in order to see a Cirque show so was seated right at the window facing the strip. Great view, although in order to maximize the number of tables by the window there isn't much space between tables. Expect to be listening to the conversation at the next table, and vice versa.

Service was attentive and food was faithful to true French cooking. Monkfish was excellently cooked, although the portion was small. The chef did serve an amuse bouche of a pistachio soup. Souffle for dessert was good, but not great. Petit fours are served with the check. A loud group at the bar marred the romantic feel of the dinner somewhat. Overall a cool experience but don't expect to feel like you're in France.
