WOd8tWsh2Yt_osHv-ngx_w We really enjoyed our brunch here! My only regret is that we found this place on our last day in Montreal! We were looking for a chill place to have brunch and this fit the bill. The menu is expansive and there was so much we wanted to sample. We ordered the florentine eggs benedict, the salmon omlette, a 1/2 order of the nutella and banana waffle and a nutella, banana, and strawberry crepe. It was all a generous portion and delicious.  I loved that they are open early and close late each day. We got there on a Sunday at 10am expecting to have a wait, but we found parking easily, we were sat immediately and served quickly. We sat in the enclosed patio and while there were a lot of people there, it felt comfortable. Our server was outstanding too. I highly recommend and we will definitely be back!!!
