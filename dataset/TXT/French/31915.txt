gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA This was one of my favorite restaurant experiences I can remember. I went to Las Vegas with my girlfriend over Thanksgiving Weekend 2011 to get away, and wanted to plan one nice dinner for her. We were staying at the Palms (where this restaurant is located on the top floor) and decided to try the hotel's French cuisine.

Boy were were impressed. They honored my requested for a window table and put us in the very corner by the windows with two sides of Las Vegas night view right next  to us. Gorgeous!

The service was impeccable. Aside from a little spillage blunder the food runner made on our tablecloth (it's okay, we didn't judge), the entire front of house staff that interacted with us was timely, friendly, efficient, and kept us eating and drinking at a perfect pace.

The food was outstanding. I can't remember the last time I've enjoyed food that much. Every bite was like a foodgasm!

While I can't remember the dessert we tried, here's what we had before that:

Pan Seared Foie Gras
Fuji Apples & Almond Crumble
Crème Anglaise, Port Reduction
**Wouldn't normally be a fan of Foie Gras, but this dish practically melted in our mouths...outstanding.

Honey Almond Crusted Rack of Colorado Lamb
Spicy Apricot Couscous, Curried Zucchini Fritter
Harissa Lamb Jus
**The honey almond taste was incredible, the port reduction was a great touch of flavor, and the fritter had great texture and was delicious!

Roasted Venison Loin
Venison Osso Buco & Bacon Croustillant, Chestnut Confit, Polenta Cake
Red Currant Purée & Poivrade Sauce
**The Red Currant Puree and Poivrade Sauce made an already savory venison loin that much better.

Possibly the most romantic and satisfying dinners out I've ever had. Thanks Alize, I'll recommend you to my Vegas-going friends!
