DZkl5MleRKh0isxj1Y2Abg We had dinner in March (the day of earth hour).  Nice wine list.  I was enchanted by the server's explanation of how the different grapes in a Bordeaux were like the bones and muscles in your body.

The ttoro (like a bouillabaisse) was awesome; it's the destination dish of the restaurant. The lentil salad was also delicious.  The rabbit tartine was forgettable (like a cold chicken sandwich) and we were confused and expecting a terrine.  I blame the earth hour candlelight that made it hard to read the menu.  We mentioned this to the server in passing, and she graciously took the tartine off the bill.  For dessert, the tarte tatin tasted like it was made by the French aunt I always wished I had.

It's a tiny little place and they make all the food on a hot plate behind the bar!
