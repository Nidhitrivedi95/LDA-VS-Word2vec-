KNBHGY4rQVuoHxZf_6ANuw Woohoo... I'm the first to review! 

I was a bit hesitant about staying here since the reviews on other sites were mixed, however I found this hotel to be great and suitable to our needs. For anyone that is concerned about the construction, there should be no worries. The construction is really just a renovation that is confined to just the lounge/bar area. No noise or dust anywhere. The staff were friendly and extremely accommodating. The manager hooked us up with a room upgrade to a suite room! We also received a lot of great recommendations on where to sight-see (Parc du Mont-Royal) and where to drink/eat (Weinstein and Gustovino's). 

Our suite room (Room 1000) is modern and nicely laid out. There were several issues that we did notice, however did not really bother us all that much: No hairdryer (front desk asked us to look in the cabinet under the sink, but it was a pedestal sink!), the bed was VERY firm and the linens a bit rough for my silky smooth skin. Oh, and just a side note, there were spiders on the exterior of the building; no possible way of getting in, but did anyone else notice that all of Montreal is just crawling with spiders all over the place??? 

Parking was a bit odd. Hotel guests have to park in P-9/P-10 which is 9/10 flights below (we got a bit dizzy going in circles). The elevator is right there, although it only goes as far up to the Food Court level. You then have to walk up a flight of stairs to the lobby to check-in. Because of this set up, there is no one to help you with your luggage if you do self parking. Odd. 

Overall, I really enjoyed staying here and would gladly stay here again. The neighborhood is a bit dead during the weekends, however the Metro is right in the candy-land convention center across the street and everything is within a 10 minute walk.
