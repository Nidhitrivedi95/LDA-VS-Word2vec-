jLxeBgWhLRbII2ACkgH1Sg Came here for a breakfast meeting the first time last week. I'm back again. The usual French backers I take the kids to Saturday morning was closed for Thanksgiving weekend. So we came to La Belle Terre - a bit out of the way (for us) but magnificently worth it. 

The kids ate croissants. They large, flakey and buttery on the inside. The Florentine quiche was so good last time I got it again and the salmon quiche. 

Everything is made on site, daily. You can taste the difference too. I'm a sucker for quiche. If it's on the menu I'm typically ordering it. Panera has good quiche. La Belle has elite quiche. All of the ingredients are present and forward. That's the best I can describe it. They warm them up if you want. I recommend it. It takes 6 minutes. And then, the cheese oozes. So good. 

I should mention they serve Peet's Coffee. Next time I come, I'm trying the crepes.
