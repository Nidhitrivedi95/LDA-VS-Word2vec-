K64Uw3a2Enh2MznpwRHWKQ Our daughter gave us a voucher this restaurant and we finally decided to use it on date night recently.  We made reservations, dresses up a bit and went out for dinner.  First off the place it totally adorable with intimate seating and the chef visible.  We we seated at a nice table but I was checking for the a/c vent to avoid and li and behold the hostess noticed and took us to a table far away from the vents.  We each had a delicious cocktail befor dinner.  My husband got the salmon meal and I went for the the beef bourguignon.  Both were absolutely delicous!  My hubby couldn't stop raving about his salmon and the sauce.  My beef was absolutely beautiful!  Tender and tasty with rich gravy and crisp veggies. I also had a glass of the house wine which went perfectly!  We saved room for some decadent desserts and vowed we would go back again!
