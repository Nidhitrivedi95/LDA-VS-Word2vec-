P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ We had been here before and loved it. We reserved the Chefs Table and were presented with one of the best meals of our life. The tasting menu at the Krug Table was amazing to say the least. Chef presented and explained each course. If you love French food, this is a place you need to try!
