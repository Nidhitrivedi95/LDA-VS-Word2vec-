XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q If you've never been, it's impossible to explain just how exceptional - this dining experience is. The service is wonderful, attentive without being annoying. And the food, there's no way to do it justice with words. Each course, each morsel of food, from the bread (baked fresh daily with ingredients specially imported from France) to the dessert cart (prepared with dozens of exquisite sweets made on the premises) was superlative. Worth every single penny!!!!!!
