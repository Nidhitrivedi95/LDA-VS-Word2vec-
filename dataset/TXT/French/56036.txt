rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Came here for a nice dinner while on a weekend trip to Vegas with my girlfriends.  Service was fantastic and the food was amazing.  3 of us ordered the Steak Frites and my other friend ordered the Gigot d' Agneau (lamb).  The Steak Frites was amazing.  The flatiron steak was cooked perfectly and the carmelized onions and butter on top added an explosion of flavor.  The dish came with a large amount of deliciously salty fries that were a great accompaniment to the meat.  It was one of the best meals I've had in a long time.  Would definitely return.
