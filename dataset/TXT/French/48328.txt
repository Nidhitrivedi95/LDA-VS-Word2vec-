O66Zy8Y13VBm72ZDhS4fIg We had purchased a groupon for our last night in toronto dinner. We were moving out of the city and wants to have a nice meal at a restaurant we never got a chance to check out. Ive always had sassafraz on my list of places but the opportunity never really came up. 

Service: very attentive service. Our server was so helpful and funny. You expect to always get a bit of snubby service when using a groupon at a posh restaurant but this was not the case. 

But the food took FOREVER to come out. We arrived at 7:30 and left around 10pm. My parents also had a similar experience. The kitchen was super slow to get the food out. 

Food:
We ordered a bottle of ontario niagara wine which was reasonably priced at 30-something dollars.
For the appetizers we shared the chowder with scallops and the bone marrow. The chowder was much more filling and quite tasty but the bone marrow was a lot more enjoyable with a lentil puree which seemed a little off place... and two small portions of Crostini.  Thankfully there was free warm bread and butter. I wish the butter had been soft. Cold butter ia hard to spread.  I regress....

For the mains we shared the lamb shank and the steak. Truthfully... these were huge disappointments. Very underwhelming... there was nothing that made hear dishes stand out or pop out. The beans with the lamb shank were just meh. Something easily made at home. The steak was just steak. Wih a few little potatoes.  I expected something more.

Dessert: churros and a chocolate cake with ice cream . Both were good. The chocolate lava cake I prreffered more just because there was more of it. 

So in conclusion. We were pretty disappointed. The food itself would have gotten 2 stars but the service of our waiter elevated it to 3. This was an opportunity to see if we would be back on a normal evening and sad to say, likely not.
