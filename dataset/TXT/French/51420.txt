P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ Wow! As good as the Paris location. We ordered the 10 course Prestige tasting, but I counted 17 courses before we left. The soup was as wonderful as we rememberer, but "the colors of Cavier" and the "Oysters in Ice Gelée" were as wonderful, as was the off menu tomato sampler.

A tour of the kitchen was a delightful added touch (and I didn't realize they had a table in the kitchen!).

I look forward to coming back!
