O66Zy8Y13VBm72ZDhS4fIg I've been wanting to try Sassafraz for ages and I've been won over! To begin, the dining room is beautiful with the exposed high glass ceilings and waterfall wall. We ordered the duck pâté and lamb meatballs to start. I thought both appetizers were delicious but the lamb meatballs would be my pick out of the two. As a pasta lover, I really wanted to try the bison parpadelle (maybe next time for lunch,,,) However, I decided to try something new and I am happy to say that it worked out for the better! For the entree, I had the duck breast which was cooked perfectly and worked very well with the brussel sprouts and cauliflower in a delicious sauce. Everything was also plated beautifully which really adds to the experience. For dessert, we opted for the crowd favourite (banana tart) along with the chocolate cake. Honestly, after trying both the desserts, my boyfriend and I agreed that we should have each gotten a banana tart instead because it was that good! Overall, I had a great date night here and am thoroughly impressed that the dinner met all the expectations I had about Sassafraz.
