_T7f2wUgNlJqxsR-cR89SQ My husband and I celebrated my big 30th birthday at Scaramouche last weekend.

I would agree with other Yelpers that the food were all classic gourmet dishes, prepared well, and presented nicely, but missing that outstanding wow factor. That said, the signature coconut cream pie was probably the best I've ever had, and I am usually not a fan of coconut! For starters, we tried the raw oysters from Northern Canada and New Zealand, the shrimp and lobster salad crepe, and the pea pecorino ravioli - surprisingly very light yet still flavorful. For entrees, the lamb rack chops and the St. Canut pork were meaty and served with a nice variety of accompaniments. Portion to price value was fine. The cocktails were a bit weak but I didn't mind since I'm a lightweight.

Service was professional and knowledgeable as expected. We arrived late for our reservation (due to our Uber driver and detours), but it was no problem at all. We requested seating by the window and enjoyed the lovely view of the city skyline. They also remembered to add a candle to my dessert! All in all, this is a nice fancy restaurant choice for a special occasion.
