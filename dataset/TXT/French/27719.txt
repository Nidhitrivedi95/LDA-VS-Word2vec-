DOmVF9YKOvTkqjcgUwtOgQ My review in one word? Disappointed.

I've heard about this place for years and years.  So many people have told me that I HAVE to try this restaurant out etc etc..So, last week, I finally went in with my fiance, and man was I unimpressed.

Let's start with the pros:
1. Clean 
2. Nice ambiance and decor
3. Knowledgable and courteous staff

Cons:
1. It took FOREVER and a day for our food to come...mind you, this was a Monday evening and there weren't many people, so I'm not sure why this was the case.....
2. The food was bland. Seeing as to how seafood seemed to be their specialty, I was extremely excited about my salmon tartare, and the house fries which we were told were nothing short of amazing. My tartare literally had no taste...I've made better in my own kitchen. And the fries were not really good.... I thought that maybe my fiances lamb would be good because it looked phenomenal, but again, no taste......
3. Semi pricey for no reason...

So I was and am very disappointed, and will definitely not be back. I'm still not sure what all the hype is about! Maybe it's their seafood platters that are amazing??

Meh....
