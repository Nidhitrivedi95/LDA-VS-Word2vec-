w1BbvLeKBSKBnlALLhPmGg The Malmasion is a gorgeous boutique hotel in Edinburgh, located on the banks of the Forth in Leith.  I visited the brasserie for brunch recently and it was amazing.  It started with the soup of the day, self service from the chefs table, a lovely creamy spicy parsnip soup.  Then we were invited to select something from the chefs table.  There were loads of options such as omelettes, waffles, cold meats, salads, bread, pancakes, pates and terrines.  From past experience I suggest booking your table earlier in the day, as the second time I visited for Brunch the options were limited due to it being busy early on.  Also, pace yourself!  There is so much lovely food on offer, don't over do it on the first two courses, because you won't have room for the rest! 

Next was the mains, a selection of six options from the menu, I can recommend the roasts and salmon.  Finally if you have any room, you can order a dessert, don't worry there are lighter options such as sorbet and fresh fruit salad.  All that for a tasty £19.95, marvellous and you won't need to eat for the rest of the day.  The Sunday brunch is very popular and it can be very busy.  Sometimes it feels a little too busy and the neighbouring tables are a little too close for comfort.  When personal boundaries come into it, I feel that they have tried to pack the customers in far too much.  Alas, the brasserie does serve great-tasting cuisine, prepared with incredible local ingredients, so enjoy!

If the weather suits, you can even enjoy some alfresco dining or drinking on the terrace.  Also if you are lucky enough to be staying and the boutique hotel there is a hotel gym, Gymtonic to work off that heavy brunch!
