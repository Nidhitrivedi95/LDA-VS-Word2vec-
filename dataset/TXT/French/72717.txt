XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q Went here with my co-worker didn't really do much research cause another co-worker has recommended it. Thinking that he know how much a cook get paid he would recommend something way off the price line, but holy mother of god. i wish the waiter would actually explain to us that this is a prefix menu no matter what you order. and the fact that water was offer but didn't give the option of tap water..if i knew i would  just stick to wine. $10 for water? really? I had the currie lobster which was two 2 oz piece of lobster plus a 1 oz stuff squid. oh yeah and  the size of half my pinky potato.. which didn't taste like currie at all. food was not hot enough. the dessert was pretty good.. thank god i fill up on bread if not i would have to stop by a taco stand or micky d's. So for the size of a tapas and a desserts your looking at $127 plus $10 water plus $30 for tax plus tips=180 per person..if you don't sh*t out money, its not worth the experience.
