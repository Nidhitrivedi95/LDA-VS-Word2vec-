pKiSzUlBBRNEdTML24piXA I love Tapas! I'm a Tapas kinda guy, kinda makes me sound gay, but dont worry I have a beautiful girlfriend who I took along with my father to Centurion.
Hands down every single plate that they brought to the table was AMAZING! 
From the prawns to the filet medallions and risotto, this place was on point. EXCELLENT FOOD!
The waitstaff was a little unprepared for the scotch menu but totally redeemed themselves by offfering a sample of some fine scotch to see if was to our liking.
Keep up the good work, and take your waitstaff to Totalwine and more class on sundays.
