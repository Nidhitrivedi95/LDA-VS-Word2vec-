rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Went back around Thanksgiving w/ a gf and I ordered some beef short rib special, I think it was?  The meat was so flavorful and juicy and it literally melted in my mouth.  It came on a bed of cubed, oven roasted root vegetables that were perfectly cooked and seasoned just right~~~  Seriously, I think my button flew off somewhere during the meal, but I could not stop eating the glorious goodness placed before me until it was gone.  I know, I'm such a pig!
