d482l58ho0_IMdFkXX1F5Q We went for Happy hour and didn't have a wait at 5:00 pm so all was good.  Tried the Oysters and they were small but tasty.  Not too much guts so it went down nicely.  The cheese plate was really skimpy but they accommodated our request for no blue cheese and it was fine.  We also had the altasian flatbread which was essentially bacon and cheese on a flatbread.  Nothing special there.  The calamari was ok, a little soggy and not crispy hot like I expected.  Small serving for happy hour.  Again, nothing really special.  I would recommend Cannelettos happy hour instead.  The service was good and that's all I can say about the place.  I was expecting more but left kind of disappointed.  Oh, and the bees knees was good, not like cough syrup given the description but for $9, it didn't seem like that should be a happy hour special.  Oh well, we crossed this place off at least.
