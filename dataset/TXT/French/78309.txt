The Octopus, one of their signature dishes really delivered - great texture and flavor.  Veal sweat breads did not disappoint and the tomato with mozzarella ice-cream was a delight.  The waiters all had an opinion on wine pairings and let you try a couple of samples to dial it in.  If you are a Montrealer you probably know about this place and if you are just visiting worth a go for a cool off-the-beaten track, fine dining experience.
