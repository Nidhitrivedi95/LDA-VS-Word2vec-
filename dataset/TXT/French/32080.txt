gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA Well damn.  My friend and I drove banzai-style to Vegas (in ~8.5 hours from San Jose) to see a John Legend show at the PALMS.  We got in, napped, showered, bootylicioused up, ate dinner here and then saw an amazing show.  Clubbed a bit and then slept until 2am and hit the road.

But back to this restaurant -- great service, great, AMAZING views.  Great menu.  Fantastic people watching.
