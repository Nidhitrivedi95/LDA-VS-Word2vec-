It's pretty cool cause they actually have real swings. I think they were under staff cause the service was a big slow. The bathroom was mix and there was only one but it was clean.

They recommend taking 2-3 tapas Per person, I thought that the portions were really big for a tapas. First off I had the soup of the day which was cauliflower and it really wasn't good at all. It was a big bowl of soup that just fills you up. Then I had the salad with a beet dressing, nuts and feta and it was 13$. The salad was mixed with so much water it was all distilled with the dressing. It was also missing other ingredients to spice it up. Then a tried the filet mignon and I really can't say anything about it excepts that it was delicious. And I also had with that, the home style fries with pepper and lemon mayo. They were pretty good but way too greasy. I had two glasses of wine which I loved!

I do still recommend it if you wanna try a new place and don't mind the price.
