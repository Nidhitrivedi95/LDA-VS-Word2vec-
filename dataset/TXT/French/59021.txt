    I've been here countless of time before, since being a fan of the Bellagio for a decade and chef Sirio since New York, but this time was very special. New executive chef Wilfried Bergerhausen, he's talented, young, handsome and simply awesome. I met him at Michael Mina Bellagio last year. He was nice, genuine and talented. I knew it wouldn't be long before he could be an executive chef of some amazing restaurant.

   Chef Bergerhausen was the executive sous chef at Michael Mina at the Bellagio before he came to the Michelin Star Le Cirque. He replaces chef Paul Lee. Chef Bergerhausen worked at Joël Robuchon for almost 5 years, as well as L'Oasis in Mandelieu La Napoule, France. He was an assistant chef at Bocuse D'or, the worldwide cooking competition, with chef  Eric Finon, competed in Paris. 

    Experience the timeless sensation created by charismatic Restaurateur, Sirio Maccioni. The rarity of Le Cirque's AAA Five Diamond rating speaks eloquently of French cuisine - exquisite, bold, transcendent. Immerse yourself in a jubilant showing of brilliant color adorning this famed lakeside destination designed by Adam D. Tihany. The moment you walk in, you will feel this luxurious feel, elegantly designed, a bit bold, bright, but grande, it feels as I walk in a chateau, I feel royalty, I feel special and the service from the moment we walk in till we left, it was perfect in every single way. 

    We got lucky the wonderful GM Ivo Angelov got us a corner booth table which is my favorite with the lake view of the Bellagio, priceless, with my client Apple iTunes department, I was here for CES 2015. I couldn't be happier.

    Everything was delcious, chef Wilfried Bergerhausen knows what he is doing. My clients were every happy, my best friend loves everything and so did I. The 70 seats Le Cirque was packed every night since chef is on board. This Le Cirque under chef Wilfried is a 2 Michelin Stars in the making. I can't wait to come back.

    The wine list is impressive and the sommelier is so wonderful here. He helped us to choose the perfect wines to pair with our dinner. My group was very happy with the choice. 

   If you want to celebrate your BDAY, anniversary, a promotion, or just because you are loved, Le Cirque Bellagio is a perfect place for you. And tell GM Ivo that you hear this from me :-) You will thank me later :-) Enjoy!
