SBnpT6JDbah-5l_52GM5sw Elegant dining room with a view of Lake Monona and heavenly food makes Sardine one of my favorite brunch spots in Madison. 

They take reservations and often times you can even walk in and get seated without having to wait. Just yesterday I walked in and immediately got a table right by the window. 

Sardine is supposed to be a French bistro, and it really looks the part. Decor is simple and classic. Doesn't hurt that there are fewer lake view restaurants in Madison than I can count on my hand(s - depending on what you count), so that automatically makes Sardine very special. 

Given all of this, I'd probably love this place even if it had average food. But the food is SO SO DELICIOUS! 

Without a doubt, my favorite thing to order is the baked creamed eggs. The cheese and prosciutto make it so incredibly perfect that I could probably eat six of them in one sitting. It comes with well dressed greens and a few slices of wonderful baguette.

The specials are always great, and so are the sandwiches on the menu. The Bloody Mary is one of my favorites in Madison and it goes great with the oysters they serve. I am getting so hungry writing this! If you've never had brunch at Sardine, it needs to go on the top of your list!
