ysJo5Jdo29XOBCnKrbUKWg Truly outstanding. 

Few places can transport you to another mental location when you're there. This is one of them. I couldn't believe we were in the city. I was quiet, and filled with tons of beautiful knick knacks and french items. 

The service was very nice - a young french girl. I recognized many of the items on the menu but some were unfamiliar. I didn't request a translation but I sensed she would have given me accurate descriptions of the items, had I asked. 

I got the croque Madame, which was excellent. The manager stopped by, and he was a true pleasure to talk with.

Overall this place was a real winner. Great food and service in a nearly unbelievable atmosphere. A place perfect for romantic dinner!!

I would highly recommend this location.
