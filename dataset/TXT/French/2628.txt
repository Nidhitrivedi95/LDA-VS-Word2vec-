I had the degustation while hubby had the truffle tasting. started with a light crab salad, then a perfectly seared scallop. Next was a rich foie gras with crispy almond slivers followed by a perfectly medium rare wagyu beef. Hubby's came with filet (not wagyu) which was topped with truffle. My wagyu was rich and buttery while his filet had a bolder meaty flavor, to each their own. Don't forget their coffee which is an excellent finish to the meal along with their beautifully artistic desserts. Wines pair well with meals. Oh, and then there's the take home box.
