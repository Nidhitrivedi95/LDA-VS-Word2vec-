5EIuCcoHY2evAhFMBV6G6g We had free vouchers for a prix fixe dinner.  Well, started with an onion soup and it was okay.  I didn't want to eat too much thinking I was going to eat too much.  Unfortunately, I didn't expect the serving size to be made chid size.  Jesus.  Thank god we ordered plenty of appetizers or I would have been heading to the Grande Lux Cafe to fill my appetite.  Next time, I'll stay away from the prix fixe and order off the menu.
