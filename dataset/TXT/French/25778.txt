Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA Looked for something to do on Halloween night, so my friends and I decided to get table service here at the Mix. Upon arrival, we began our ascent up 64 floors to the lounge atop Mandalay Bay where we were presented with a [somewhat] spectacular view of the strip. I say somewhat because you can only see half, with all that construction blocking the stuff further down.

I expected more people, being Halloween and all, but maybe they all decided to go clubbing instead. Anyway, I enjoyed the views and the music, despite cramming 5 at a table big enough for 3-4. Even the views in the bathroom were spectacular. For the few minutes you spend in the bathroom, you can pretend you're Leonardo DiCaprio standing at the bow of the Titanic.
