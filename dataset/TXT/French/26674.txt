Our waiter was helpful and really assisted us in picking a desert. We ordered the cheesecake! Oreo & strawberries were a hit. I would have liked more Oreo. We are every bit. The bathroom was clean too. I always judge a place by the bathroom. Makes me think they truly care about cleanliness. It's kind of a big deal for me. Anyways, it was a nice spot that stays open until to 2am. Watching from the widow how lively things get at night. This place will hold a special place in my food memory. Those ribs pared with that smoked Mac and cheese LAWD!
