AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw Looking for a breakfast meal that isn't fast food or $20 a plate can be a challenge when staying on the strip in Vegas.

Two days we found ourselves grabbing a bite here to go. The first day we had coffee with  a muffin and a pastry. I had a blueberry muffin which I found on the dry side. One companion agreed that the muffin was dry, the other felt it went well with the coffee. The cheese pastry tasted like any other cheese pastry. Nothing special except the $4+ price.

The second meal here we had actual breakfast. I had the veggie crepe. While ordering, I was quickly reminded by the cashier that these items were premade and could not be customized in any way. Ok. No problem. I liked that there was a menu item with no meat, cheese or sauce. The crepe was made with a buckwheat crepe, which was also appreciated. I don't remember the name of the other crepe ordered, but it was creamy with chicken. I hear it was good, but the person who ordered this felt nauseous after the meal. I'm not saying it was due to the crepe, but it might have been. The last item was the croque monsieur. I didn't did dare take a bit because it looked gooey and cheesy. It was reportedly good, yummy with the cheese. Coffee went well with the meal.
