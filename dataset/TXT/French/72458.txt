I had a really fun and surreal foodie experience. I felt like Asian Alice in Wonderland sitting in the White Queen's English garden and game parlour. 

I chose the $168 pre-fix menu which included:
- the standard caviar and crab melody amuse buche. I like caviar and crab, I felt very special eating this first. 
- soup: a light green pea and bacon cream with a hint of peppermint and sweet onion cloud. This was very tasty indeed. I would have licked the cup if I could but it would have been highly inappropriate. 
-salad: king crab touched with indian curry, avocado, romaine lettuce in a coral virgin olive oil and some kind of creamy vingarette. this looked pretty but the taste of Indian curry was too strong for me
- main course: spiny lobster poached in a sea urchin boullion  with radish shaving and nori. this would have been perfect had it not smelt so damn fishy.
-dessert: pistachio creme brulee, raspberry infused with an apperitif wine, rose sabayon with freeze dried raspberries and a raspberry sorbet topped with pistachio brittle. I loved this dessert. I didn't think raspberries were too overwhelming. 

the highlights of this experience hardly had anything to do with the actual meals. What impressed me the most was:

- Le pain cart: first of all, I think it is odd that the french word for bread is spelled "P-A-I-N", because I feel that too much bread can hurt your stomach.  The selection was Gynormous,  It was like a United French bread conference where almost every type of french bread was represented, from the tiny cheese brioche to the long sour dough baguette. They also had this pinwheel roll made up puff pastry and olive oil that was to die for.

What was equally important to note is the "BIG @$$" brick of butter in a glass case. It is so big, this brick of butter needs it's own cart. I'm wondering how many frenchmen it took to churn this large block of butter or did they just find some overgrown magic bovine to lay this huge butter egg? Once you select your bread, the server will wheel in the butter brick cart and  hand curl your serving of butter with a warm spoon. the server will then sprinkle a few droplets of sea salt granules on top of the butter. 

Finally there are the mignardises also known as the tiny bite size desserts served after the dessert. weird, but this too deserves its own cart. The cart is filled head to toe with petite fours, handmade marshmallows, tuilles, brittles, meringues, macarons,  macaroons, caramels, gels, frail lollipops and various truffles. the wait staff doesn't mind you being a piggy
