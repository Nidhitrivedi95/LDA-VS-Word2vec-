8xCiibfgqy-8xpCWEaguqg My friends and I came here for dinner and it was okay.

Our waitress was super nice and friendly,
I believe her name was "Mary..." something. The problem was our food, it took at least 45mins - 1 hour for our food to come out. And they came out wrong, I asked my steak to be medium rare, it came out medium. My friend had a combo, steak w/ king crab legs, the crab leg never came out. We complained to the manager, at first he questioned us "when did u first sit down? How long did it take u to order ?" I believe he questioned us because he didn't believe it took an hour for our food to come out. In the end, he was very apologetic, and gave us a round for free shots and comped my friends meal. 

The food was good (probably because I was starving), but the food time was bad. Coming out late and coming out wrong. For a first time experience too, it was no good.
