SLP7aSoiwfv6rPUhs16pyQ Excellent food and atmosphere. It's clear they care a lot about the food they're servinfg - the waiter took the time to explain each dish as he presented it to each guest. It felt like a family restaurant as well so it felt like they cared more than the average restaurant about the customer experience and were so proud of every dish. I would highly recommend trying La Porte. We went during one of the busiest weekends of the year in Montreal - the Grand Prix. A group of 8 of us went, and everyone agreed we have to go back next year.
