RZk_PE-H9SygqwSQd88cWQ Lovely place with fantastic staff.

I love their soups. Every dish comes with a starter soup and it was never the same soup twice! If I could I would order a three course meal of their soups.
The food is very basic, which is nice. Usually you get a salad, some type of meat, and fries, along with a starter soup. 

They do favor their salt, so I did find a few of their dishes to be over salted, so fair warning to those who watch their sodium intake! 

I always make sure to visit this place whenever I am in Montreal, and I recommend you do too if you want a nice, basic but tasty meal.
