rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Great dining experience all around!
We spent one day in Vegas for my mom's birthday. She had never been in Vegas before so it was pretty special.

The restaurant itself is beautiful. Well decorated yet not over the top. Our waiter was knowledgeable and friendly.
We started off with bread and butter because bread and butter is everything. Then we had some foie gras and mussels for appetizers. Everything was on point. 
I had the mussels in white wine with spinach as my entree, my mom had the truite and honestly cannot remember what the rest of my fancy ordered but I can tell you that all the dishes were gone and that everybody was happy. The sauce for the mussels was delicious. Right amount of salty, tangy and creamy. The mussels were cooked perfectly.
For desert we got the profiteroles and the lemon tart. Great way to end an awesome meal. 
Very happy overall and my mom loved it!
