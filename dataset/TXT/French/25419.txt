Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA Really? This place is such a dated, throwback to 2003. The food is dated, the decor is dated- red and white pleather? They keep the lights really low so you can't see how dingy everything is.  The waiter kept bragging about all the celeb couples who have been there- Brad and Jennifer, JLO and Ben Affleck- and I'm thinking "how long ago was that?"  Is that the last time this place was "cool'?  This is NOT fine dining.  Guy Savoy is fine dining.  Joel Robuchon is fine dining. Just sayin'...
