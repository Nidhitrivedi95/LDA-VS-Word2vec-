Da6eZFThE9xanUAGNpZxAg We were in Toronto for one night from LA and stumbled on Nuit walking the neighborhood.   We are spoiled back home with great restaurants and Nuit went head to head with our favorites back home. The food is top notch.  love the approach that is kind of tapas like if you want because it is designed to share varied hors d'oeuvre. The staff is terrific,  fun, knowledgeable. Friendly. Good food without condescension.  We even walked out with a pickle recipe. 

Exceptional charcuterie selection. They even managed to introduce us to a new olive from our second home Tuscany.  Try the burnt olives!  The  Locally made spicy Soprasetta was  delicious and 
Had a serious kick.  Perfect! The house made pickled green beans are so good we asked for the recipe. 

The house cocktails were creative,  we'll balanced and not over sweet.  Excellent very original home made mixes.  The  "Blue Botanist" goes down as one of my favorite cocktails hands down ever.

We agree with all of the other great reviews of the pork ribs.  Delicious, juicy, perfect glazed and crisped.  Blew my mind having it on on a bed of Mac N cheese.  We also had the special of the roast  quail wrapped in bacon which was spot on.

What else can I say!  Lovely people.  Creative food very well executed. Good music not turned up too loud with a cool decor.  Enjoy!
