sbcMKOaLJTIYXpk0jDw7Fw Went to Bistro Moderne on Good Friday. Later booking with me, my 81 year old mother and the teens. So as with many an eatery, the food and the service occupied two different parts of a Venn diagram meeting only sporadically in the sweet spot. So for the technical bit, the Ginger amaretto sour was to die for, I had two just to make sure. For the geeks, saliiza amaretto, maraschino luxardo, lemon juice and fresh ginger. For starters I went for the ham hough Ballontine the quails had gone on hunger strike so had to make do with a poached hens egg. Topped off with foam and a burnt slice of pineapple which was a lovely touch. For mains, but arriving exactly an hour after the starters was my whole plaice, cafe de Paris butter (nope I don't know either) samphire (so 2010?) lemon, parsley, capers and helped by green beans with feta gremolata. As for the others, the grannie and muy daughter lived the soft shell crab. Harry was not impressed with his pea soup with egg starter, mostly as he'd not noticed the egg. That's 14 tear old boys for you, attention span of a ......squirrel. Anyway back to the plot. I finished the meal with a rare dessert although by the time we got it, we were In a different times zone. That said the tonka (to those of us over 40 this is a sturdy toy brand) bean creme brûlée with cashew nut praline and a single stewed plum. The only real dessert I do that isn't cheese, first class.  Some nice wine from the Nuy Winery to accompany dessert made up for an average white brand (see what I did there) Spanish white earlier. There you go, food quality 4 verging on5 service 2 hence settled at a 3.
