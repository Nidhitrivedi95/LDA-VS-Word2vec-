m9aFZk1f8tSv248YErbpQA So good! We had two different sweet crepes, both were excellent! Our crepes were accompanied by coffee, which was also pretty amazing. The cafe is very charming and comfortable, we definitely had a good time getting dessert here. Pretty much the only french food the boyfriend eats are crepes, lol. I'd love to come back and try their savoury crepe selections as well as a sandwich or two as their menu offerings all look quite tasty. I'm sure once I return I will end up giving them 5 stars! Service was awesome as well.
