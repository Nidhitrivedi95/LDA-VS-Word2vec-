O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q Mediocre Food. Terrible Service. Management Doesn't Care.

I had a very disappointing experience at Morels in Las Vegas. An otherwise good and respectable brand, this particular restaurant is not only sub-par to its other locations, but very below average when it comes to restaurants in Las Vegas. 

Let's start with the food. When I order a $62 steak (their Prime corn fed beef Rib Eye sans sides) I expect it to be awesome. Not OK. Not Mediocre. But simply awesome. It wasn't worth the money I spent on it. I could have gone to a real steak house (aka. Cut, Del Monico, Morton's, Mastros, ..), spent less money and gotten a better steak. The steak was blend not cooked medium-rare as I ordered. Too bad no service personnel was around to help me out, which leads me to the next chapter of disaster.

Over the course of the dinner, I must have dealt with 4 to 5 difference waiter and waitresses. There were long absences where nobody was around to help us out. I knew something was off whey they seat you at the worst table in the house (that table next to a busy door), when the restaurant is half empty and stayed so throughout the dinner. They messed the oysters I ordered, forgot the wine, and disappeared on us. 

Lastly, what's almost the worst part, is management does not care the restaurant is falling apart at so many levels. On my way out, I happened to bump into a manager and briefly alerted him about my experience. I wasn't looking for a refund or a voucher, I had already paid at the time. The gentleman just did not care about the lack of quality and shrugged it off.

Las Vegas has tons of great restaurants. It has many great steak houses - stick with what you know if you want to spend some good money and skip Morels.
