xcmmTXhuMx2fZF2Bt69F4w Point Brugge Cafe is one of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh. Tucked away in a seemingly residential area, it boasts a cute little space with a porch that I could spend plenty of warm summer hours on. The mussels here are amazing, my top two favorites being the one curry (has a bit more flavor) and the white wine one (for a classic). The amount of mussels that you are getting for the price is definitely worth it because it comes with a massive amount. The other food on the menu is also really good but the moules frites is the dish that keeps me coming back.

Only thing is, they don't take reservations so expect a wait during peak hours on weekends.
