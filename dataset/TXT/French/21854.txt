The service was nothing short than superb, came to Montreal to visit some friends and explore the city, we had a reservation and we greeted kindly as soon as we walked in. Our waiter was friendly and lively, more importantly patient as we had difficult time choosing what to have. We ended up getting quite of bit of food to share among all of us. The food was terrific, the beef tartar was packed with flavor and ask for extra bruschetta because there is only 3 pieces along with the order. Duck poutine and shepherds pie makes my mouth water every time I think about it. Their wine selection was not bad, and had all of the essentials. We had a great time among friends and the staff, and the food with wine is amazing!
