Five Diamond Rated

The food was alright, it's not something I'll crave again. The real Pablo Picasso art was impressive though. I had the 5-course tasting menu.

Chicken croqueta with a tomato based soup: It was a good sample of Julian Serrano's tapas restaurant in Aria.

Main Lobster Salad with an Apple Champagne Vinaigrette: It was good.

Pan Seared Scallop: one of the better scallop dishes I've had. The crispy outside soaked up some flavor that made the dish.

Foie Gras: Not the way I prefer it, but was alright.

Turbot with Asparagus in Hollandaise sauce: It was very plain.

Quince (fruit similar to an apple and a pear): the sorbet and drink were the better variations.
