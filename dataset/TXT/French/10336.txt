4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Our bill was about $150 for 2 people which I thought was very good for the view and the quality of food. 

We ordered the escargot and lemon shrimp for appetizer. The escargot was very good, the shrimp was a little under seasoned. For entrée we got the new york strip and frites and the fish of the day. Both were very good but the frites were a little too dry and crunchy for my taste. my Boyfriend got a side of mac and cheese, it was good but it was only mac and cheese. I don't think that  can really be messed up. For dessert we shared the bread pudding which was Amazing!!! We also shared a bottle of Pino Noir at a very decent price. We ate the night before at Prime for double the price for basically the same quality food and view. I highly recommend this place. I would have given it a 4 to 4 1/2 star but the view was amazing. 

Also you cannot reverse patio seating its first come first serve. Be early because it's very worth it. Don't worry they have heaters that keep you VERY warm. It was in the high 40's and I had no problem sitting out there with no jacket and a light shirt. 

Service was very good.
