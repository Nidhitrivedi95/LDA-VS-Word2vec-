Make sure to bring a coat and check out the great view on the Terrace overlooking the city.  The restaurant half a floor down, which is foot level, so you can shoe shop while looking out the window while eating.  We got there at 8pm and were the only patrons there the whole night. They said it was because besides being a Monday, the Canadians hockey team were in round 3 of Stanley playoffs.  Personally I like hockey and it was played everywhere!!

 WE had the typical French dining experience!!!
Started with and aperitif--a strong licorice drink, had the smoked salmon/scallop yummy appetizer and the white fish with an amazing cream/cranberry sauce paired it with a champagne!!!  My friend loved the quinoa/goat cheese appetizer and the wild boar ribs he had.  It was all tasty delicately prepared and well presented. Very fresh and tasty!!  I am not sure why I don't give it 5 stars. Great very delicious, but not panty dripping OMG I need to eat there everyday.

I liked the light house/electronic music the had playing and the simple contemporary design.  Service was friendly yet noninvasive. Lovely experience.  fyi the entree was $29 and appetizer about $16.
