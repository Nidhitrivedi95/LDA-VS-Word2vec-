rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw I am a HUGE fan of Bardot (and most things Michael Mina). Bardot is Aria's take on a french brasserie - it's not intimidating or really over priced. The decor is beautiful and it's a very intimate restaurant.

The service is always fantastic - I prefer to go sit at the bar during happy hour because they have great specials, but sitting in the dining room is just as great. Plus, 2 words: CHAMPAGNE CART!! Don't miss out this! During brunch they offer $20 bottomless rose, which is just crazy! 

The Le Steakburger is really good, but I think my favorite dish has been the roasted chicken french dip....it's really good! I definitely suggest checking out Bardot, they have a lot to offer!
