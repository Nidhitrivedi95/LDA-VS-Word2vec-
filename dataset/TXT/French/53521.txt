QlSpPzc4Oy05ic-PsoYH4g My wife and I recently got back from our honeymoon in Thailand and stopped in on a random Saturday night. I'd previously researched the restaurant and was interested in their street food concept. The atmosphere was unique with the Southside street signs posted around the restaurant. I ordered the Roast Pork Broccoli Rabe and my wife ordered the jerk chicken skewers. The roast pork was fantastic. It was perfectly seasoned along with the broccoli and it paired well with its crusty roll. My wife also enjoyed her jerk chicken along with her rice and peas. She agreed that it was quite comparable to authentic Jamaican food. We'll definitely be back!
