AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw The only reason we stopped into Payard at The Caesar's Palace was to have a quick bite before we decided to pick up our tickets/wrist bands upstairs at the Roman Ballroom for EDC week. We didn't know how long the lines would be so we decided to have a few bites.

I ordered a Caesar Salad with Shrimp ($22.00); there were 3 large shrimp but they were tough, stringy and tasted fishy. I could only eat 2 of them and I was worried about my digestive health thereafter.

My cousin also ordered the Caesar Salad with extra anchovies. She liked her salad.

The pastry presentation was beautiful, but the taste was forgettable; Strawberry Napolean (approximately $10).

Total bill for two salads and one pastry without tip $55.00.
