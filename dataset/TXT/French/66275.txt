This is a family-owned hole in the wall a couple of blocks away from the Basilica. I went here on a whim with my girlfriend on a freezing cold Saturday night, and probably because of the weather, we got a table no problem.  There are two eating spaces, one down by the kitchen and a second one tucked away upstairs in a loft-like space. We were lucky to get a nice table on the loft overlooking the lower area and the kitchen.

My girlfriend got the pork belly with a celery truffle puree.  I have serious food envy but don't eat pork, so I sampled the celery truffle puree, and it was out of this world. 

I ordered the Rigatoni with black truffle oil with a bottle of craft porter.  Both were spot on.  The one downside of the menu was that there wasn't a single main course without pig, and this dish came with bacon.  I just ate around the bacon and enjoyed the meal without reservation, but pig-averse folk beware.

The service was awesome: friendly, down-to-earth and helpful in making beer recommendation, providing information about the ingredients in the food (all the bread is made from scratch in house), and the chef who makes it all go.
