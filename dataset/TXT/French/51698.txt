pLu3rPwdD65FEeFMqYS-zQ One of the worst restaurant i've been to by far! Kind of like Deuxlux restaurant. I usually write long reviews but this place doesn't even deserve my time. 

1- Very bland food
2- Almost everything is from frozen
3- The pasta is frozen packaged (confirmed by the waiter)
4- The soup was like, you know, bad quality baby food from a jar
5- Bread...frozen (confirmed by the waiter)
6- Salad, wilted and wet
7- Very expensive for a byob
8- I think the "chef" hates his job
9- They forgot the children's order
10- They messed up on orders for a lot of us
11- The waiter had NO experience at all

It cost between 28$ to 38$ for CRAP! Major rip off. The chef, the owner...everyone participating in this business should be ashamed! 

I will never come back. Actually, i wanted to leave but didn't dare because it was a friend's b-day party. 

I do not recommend this place to anyone.
