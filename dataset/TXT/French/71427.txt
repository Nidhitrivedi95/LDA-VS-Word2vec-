xcmmTXhuMx2fZF2Bt69F4w This is my favorite brunch spot! Located in the charming Point Breeze business area is a unique dining experience.  This intimate setting does not have a lot of seating, so arrive around opening time or else you'll be waiting for a table. 

I sat at a beautiful mosaic table right in the front of the restaurant. Large windows allow you to connect with the outdoor setting while sipping on a Belgian beer or hot coffee. My liege waffles were perfection, balancing just the right amount of sweetness. 

If you're a fan of brunch and are looking for a new spot, you must visit!
