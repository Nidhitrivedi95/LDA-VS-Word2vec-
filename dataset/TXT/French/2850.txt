0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g One of the most pleasant dining experiences of my life.

As we arrived, we where greeted in a polite and formal manner. They took our coats and there was no wait to get to our seat.

Unfortunately we were seated at the far back of the dining room away from any windows, so our view was only of the other patrons. The dining room is very spacious however, so even in the back corner we did not feel like we where stick in the corner. This was much appreciated, as I get claustrophobic in small dining rooms full of people like at Le Cirque.

The service throughout the night was professional, informed, and always there when we needed. They even toped up my wine a few times in between courses without saying anything.

The one dish that stood out the most was a giant scallop dish. It was so good, that we where obsessed with scallops for months after, looking for anything that tasted near as good.

I will most certainly go back.
