3OCooCzHgsS2xHdN-dNVXg I was given a voucher for $80 worth of food at La Maquette for my birthday.  My dining partner & I managed to get three entrees out of that: 

Roasted Lamb Shank
Broiled Scallops & Risotto
Vegetarian Wellington 

The food was room temperature, at best.  Nothing was even served warm.  The lamb shank would have been more tender had it been the proper temperature.  Because it was cold, the meat and tendons were tough.  The scallops, though large, were full of sand and lacking scallop flavour.  The vegetarian wellington would have also been more tasty had it not been cold.  

Service was very "meh".  It was a tag team of two waiters, the older gent was very nice and fun, while the younger one lacked some proper manners.  Sorry, La Maquette, but I don't think I'll be back.
