BSmqxPbQglQwP2R56OqOag We've been to Local Bistro a number of times.  We quit for a while because 82 degree wine did not sit well.  Glad that after the remodel they put in a wine room and in addition the place looks absolutely wonderful. Unfortunately, and I hope that this is a one off event the food was just not up to par.  The go to risotto was way salty and the bolognese was greasy. Hoping this was just a bad night, as this has been a staple in Scottsdale. 

It's been a month or so and I'm glad to say our previous experience was just a one off night. Ordered same entree's and whatever was wrong before was right this time.   Glad to have our staple back.
