XcWlBj5oQgzKhR7Cxovj3w I usually stop over here for lunch or dinner before my flights from PHX. I've tried different entrees here, including the zinc burger, the grilled chicken paillard, and a few other sandwiches. Food quality is average here, and as most airports, these guys are overpriced too. $17 burgers should really good in my opinion, and this place doesn't meet my expectations in that regard. Their entree options are quite limited too. An average overall experience.
