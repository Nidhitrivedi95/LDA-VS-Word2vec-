4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Pretty cool little joint. My first time at a French restaurant (in the past, I've avoided them like the plague). My partner ordered soup and salad, and he enjoyed it. I had the night's fish special and a goat cheese dish. All of the food was very good. They provided us with an endless supply of bread, which was nice.

The real reason to come here is the view. You can't beat the fountains at night time (just make sure you're close to a heater, if it's cold).
