m9aFZk1f8tSv248YErbpQA My friend and I had been planning on coming to the restaurant the past week, but when we arrived at 1:45pm today, after having driven 30min, we were turned away saying the restaurant was closed. The owner and an employee were busy putting up the chairs, and the owner turned to us just to acridly say, "Can't you READ the sign? We're CLOSED." 

However, it's posted everywhere that the store closes at 2pm on Saturdays. I just thought it was quite rude and showed a lack of integrity. If he wanted to go home whenever they wanted, don't post that the store closes at 2.
