A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g My favorite part of this bakery is walking through the doors and instantly getting punched in the face with the sweet aromas of freshly baked breads and mouthwatering decadent yet surprisingly light pastries. Lunch is very do-able here. A sandwich/panini/croissant/quiche paired with a soup or salad and a coffee drink for under $10! After gobbing your face with french delights, please make a beeline towards the highlight of all my experiences: the ginger macaron. Even if you're not a fan of the strong flavor of its root, you will be, please believe me. It's a beautiful medley of a spicy and sweet bite. It warms you up in all the right places. Now they may not look all even and the same because they are chubby and wonky which i think only adds to their charm and quirkiness, a trait i place on the tallest of macaron pedestals.

I will most likely never say no to patisserie manon.
