xcmmTXhuMx2fZF2Bt69F4w After waiting 30 minutes for a table, I was told by the server that they were out of the one item that Point Brugge is known for, their waffles. Imagine my disgust when I had driven across the city of Pittsburgh for this famed menu item and didn't get to taste it!

Considering I don't eat eggs or seafood, the only option left was French toast... From a Belguim place. Good one.
