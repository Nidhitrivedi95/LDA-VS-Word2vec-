Yp9w4nhUowBU_IS_StFXbQ As far as food in Las Vegas goes, this is a top notch breakfast place. I am certain the other meals there are just as good, however I only ate breakfast here so that's all I can share. Note that if you book the "Tower Suite Experience" for a stay at the Wynn, you will receive a complimentary breakfast here. The menu items include things like apple pancakes and yogurt parfaits, acai bowls, and chorizo omelettes. 

My kids had a yogurt parfait and plain pancakes. Plain pancakes were not on the menu, but they made them for us. They looks fantastic. With them came fresh whipped butter and syrup - no butter out of a plastic container. My husband and I had a veggie frittata which was healthy and fresh, and included veggies and feta cheese, with Parmesan and greens. We had some toast with it, and the toast came with fresh whipped butter and jams that did not look like they came out of a jar or a plastic package either. Yummy!

They also have fresh juices and cappuccinos, lattes, etc.

The ambiance here is very nice, classy and elegant, but not so much that you feel like you have to be dressed up -- it is right next to the pool (I'm sure you have to wear clothes though!). 

I would go here over some of the other options in Vegas, especially if you prefer good food with some class.
