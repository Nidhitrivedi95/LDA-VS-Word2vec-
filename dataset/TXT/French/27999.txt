DwJlGxAJvohbDR_5jV-ERA Stopped on a relatively not very busy Tuesday evening. Service was very friendly but rather inattentive. I t was reasonably priced, but whether it was drinks, bread, etc, it was definitely on the pretty slow end. We both ordered fish and it was excellent. As I said, I have no concerns with the quality of the food. The ironic thing is that there were 3 or 4 servers, often talking to each other, and only 2 to four tables of customers. After we finished, food & drinks, it probably took 15min before I finally had to wave to our server. We finally got the check.
