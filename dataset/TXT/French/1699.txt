The accompaniments of nicely prepared hash browns and light spring greens with vinaigrette are a welcome change to 'spuds and bacon'.  Communication between server and kitchen was abysmal.  Both our table and the table next to ours had their order incorrectly served, and I don't think the chef was at fault.  C'mon Scratch, invest in customer service staff that listens to the customer and knows the menu.

Go for the croissants.
