gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA I think generally, Vegas is where famous chefs go to make a buck and where cooking goes to die. There are exceptions (Robuchon, though way too expensive for what you get...and I had a very good meal at Picasso) but the quality is usually too low and prices way too high. You buy reputation rather than food.

I recently ate at Alizé on two consecutive nights. I have to say that in both cases I had very good meals. The first night far surpassed my expectations and the second night met my expectations. Great experiences. The ambiance...awesome view, nice layout and lighting...set the mood for a convivial dining experience. The service was meticulous and friendly without being underfoot. The sommelier, it should be noted, was terrific.

On both nights I started with Bouquet of Baby Greens (Caraway Cracker, Goat Cheese, Balsamic Vinaigrette). Fresh, flavorful and imaginatively served. On the first evening I had Wasabi & Sesame Crusted Rack of Lamb (Tagine Vegetables, Dried Apricots, Dates, Lamb Jus). It was delicious. The wasabi in no way overpowered the flavor of lamb. While in another case I might have a bit of mustard with lamb, this took the place of it in a more elegant, integrated combination. Inspired. On the second evening I ordered the oasted Venison Loin (Sweet & Sour Cabbage, Wild Mushroom Herb Spaetzle, Poivrade Sauce). It too was very good. The venison (from New Zealand) wasn't gamey in the least.

On the first night I ordered the Grand Marnier Soufflé for dessert. No matter how delicious, I couldn't do it a second night. Yum.

Great service, excellent wine list and sommelier, beautifully prepared menu, prices in line with Vegas dining, superb views and ambiance. A great way to spend an evening in Las Vegas.
