3rj1qpgFvkRWtAka17mhEQ Came here on a Sunday morning for breakfast since the wait was a lot shorter than Babystacks. I wish we had waited :(

I ordered the New York strip steak and eggs while my hubby ordered the cinnamon roll French toast. His French toast was delicious but that's pretty hard to mess up. Especially when it's made of cinnamon rolls haha.

Service was excellent.

My steak was cooked perfectly medium rare but I ate less than half of it because it was mostly gristle and fat. I could barely saw through it with the steak knife. Otherwise the eggs were cooked perfectly and the potatoes were delicious. For $19 those were pretty expensive eggs and potatoes. We won't be back.
