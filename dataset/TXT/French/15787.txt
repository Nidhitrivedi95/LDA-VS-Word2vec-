6GCbZASjMnAPYBWLc_z30g After 12 hours of hard labor in the Arizona heat, all I (and my boss) wanted to do was eat and sleep. It was 10pm and EVERYTHING was closed. After Chili's didn't give in to our begging and pleading to feed us, we stumbled across Mimi's Cafe. 

The place looked like a Mexican restaurant, but I was too hungry and tired to care. It's actually American diner food (obviously right? tired + hungry = my excuse). Our ancient, but friendly waitress served us some French bread and oh-so tasty sweet bread. I had what the waitress recommended, pot roast, while my boss ordered a 12 ounce steak. The portions are HUGE for the price. 

Overall a good experience and would highly recommend it if you're in the area. Why go to Chili's/Applebee's/Ruby Tuesdays when you can get better service, food, and giant portions for the same price? Oh, and their open late too.
