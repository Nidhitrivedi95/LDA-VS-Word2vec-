oS96aJIHFWcFAlGHKKXjaw Food is alright but the women who work in there aren't very friendly or helpful in my recent experience.  They have really bad attitudes and are incredibly stuck-up.  Have to give this place only 1 star as good service is a big part of the whole package!!!  Sorry ladies, you need to seriously change your tune and switch gears... you are no better than anybody else so do yourselves and everyone else a big favor and get a grip on your customer service skills, pleeaaaase!!!! 

Remember that respect, just like money is earned. duh.
