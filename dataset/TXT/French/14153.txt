58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw So so so so SO happy we found this place on our way back to Boston. What a cute little restaurant with French decor and friendly waiters/waitresses. 

We had an amazing waiter. He was accommodating even though we were a huge group of people and was extremely polite. 

I ordered the matcha latte. It was pretty spot on in terms of matcha-ness. 

I ordered the Le Sante. The eggs were perfectly poached on top of the bread with the little pesto sauce on the bottom. It came with a fig and a couple slices of cheese as well. The greek yogurt, however, is the real winner here. So creamy and the granola and blueberries on top were phenomenal. No, I'm not exaggerating. They had some really good greek yogurt! 

My boyfriend ordered the Des Cantons which comes in an iron skillet and has all types of meat, beans, eggs, and potatoes. He said he enjoyed it very much and was full from it. 

Definitely would make a stop next time we're in Montreal! Loved everything about it.
