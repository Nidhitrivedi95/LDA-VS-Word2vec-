xcmmTXhuMx2fZF2Bt69F4w This is a brilliant little restaurant tucked away in a cute little neighborhood among little houses and boutique stores. It was quite packed on a weekday evening so one can tell it's popular! Our server was very friendly, attentive and helpful. I enjoyed both my cocktails that he recommended - The Jalapeno Margarita and The Unnamed Cocktail (lavendar vodka.. ohhh yeahhh!!). The fries (Brugge Frites) are the best I've had in Pittsburgh and that's not an exaggeration. Try them for yourself and you'll know. I also really enjoyed the flatbread we ordered for our appetizer. I was way too full after that to eat dinner but couldn't resist taking their Tofu Torta sandwich to go for late night snackage. Do not and I repeat, DO NOT miss the mussels if you can help it. They come with choice of 4 sauces and I snuck a taste of their red curry sauce from my friend's plate (I don't eat seafood) and that was enough to say it must've been truly outstanding (it's spicy to beware!). I love the variety that their menu offers, from pasta to mussels in red curry to sandwiches, burgers, mac n cheese, hummus and a handsome looking cheese platter. The food is excellent, ingredients fresh and drinks just as excellent, which rarely happens! The atmosphere is very welcoming. I would highly recommend Point Brugge!! I can't wait to try brunch here.
PS: If you have room for dessert: Go for their ice cream with chocolate sauce which they make themselves! OHHH MYYY GAWDDDDDDDDDDD ..is all I can say bout that!
