mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q In a town full of excellent dining venues, the L'Atelier exceeds expectations, based on my dining experiences, this is more like the Michelin one star quality equivalent to the European standard.  Two of us sampled 15 different dishes, each was true to its description and prepared to perfection, the plating was also fun; The Langostine was heavenly light, the Foie gras parfait was creamy and rich, the pork belly melted in the mouth, and the mash potato was golden and buttery.....  Excellent wine list, too, the ambiance is fun and flirty, attentive service in a casual setting, I would happily return here, meals like this I could eat everyday.  Two thumbs up!
