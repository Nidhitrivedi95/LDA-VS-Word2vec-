oZHbPhIj01_31jqD053a_Q Amazing experience!!!! Nothing like this place. So, trendy and classy! The service-impeccable. The decor-1st class, cutting edge with a hip like club feel. The food-masterful flavored. The drinks-tasty and smarty mixed. The presentation-art on a plate. This place is the standard of excellence and food creativity. This place really deserves 10 stars.

**Note: If you are in LOVE with someone then this is the place to add to your loving experiences.

So, check it...I ordered the Cesar Salad soup, which was oddly delicious... the Lobster civet with lemon confit, which was crazy bursting with flavors and their sample desserts..also amazingly good! I would move to Montreal just to be a regular at this place!!! GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
