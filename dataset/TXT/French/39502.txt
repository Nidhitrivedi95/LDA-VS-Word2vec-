My friends and I got to try the mango gelato, shrimp sandwich, lamb sandwich and their super yummy dark chocolate dessert.  One of the best gelatos I have ever had.

It's nice to find a modern design restaurant in North York where you can go and chill with friends after work and avoid the traffic going up north or south.  There's plenty of parking in front so it's very convenient.
