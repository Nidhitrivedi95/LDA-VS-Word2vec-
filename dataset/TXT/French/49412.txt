or4UVDjXEEjze3wNPjoAZA A week old review but nonetheless we must give Zinc their props for A+ quality ingredients in traditional recipes and mostly an extra half a star for keeping my mobile that I left at the dinner table and realized was misplaced over an hour after my departure...Oops, kudos to the front of the house and we'll be back for a late nite snack of truffle fries for sure! 

Hubby enjoyed his protein & foie combo, however the Madeira sauce was a bit too prevalent in the dish for me, but I was quite content with my own selection. The broth was divine and quality of mussels sourced from the great Washington coast added points to the dish for nostalgia (having called the Puget Sound area home for some years.)

Reservations are a must for weekends and be prepared for intimate seating as I've enjoyed in many a Parisien bistros. I miss the selection along the rue Saint Martin but if I can't have Alain Ducasse in AZ, I'll continue to be a beggar and not a chooser!
