lcTa0q9Wo4wNyLCIgWFRUA Nice restaurant inside of Loews Hotels. I enjoyed the burger although it could have been better. Everyone always raves about how amazing the food is in Montreal, this restaurant was a bit less than I expected. Fries were good. 

I didn't understand the Caesar salad. I absolutely love Caesar salads and this one just didn't do it for me. The dressing was so so and I really didn't like the fact that I had to cut it my self.
