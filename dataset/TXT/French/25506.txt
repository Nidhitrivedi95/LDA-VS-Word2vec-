Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA This restaurant is ultra posh + chic. We came here for pre-dinner drinks + dinner. 

3 stars for the restaurant
4 stars for the lounge

{ORDER}
* King prawns for appetizer
* Filet mignon rossi with foie gras
* Mac + cheese

{DON'T ORDER}
* Any of the fish - it certainly did not taste fresh. Let's just say I had a couple of bites and I was done.

{ENVIRONMENT}
* Love the sexy appeal of this place. I feel like I'm in Miami. I love the glass bubbles that drop down from the ceiling. 
* If you get a chance to go outside to the patio, the view of the strip is amazeballs.

{SERVICE}
Nothing out of the ordinary.

{TIP}
Come early enough for happy hour (check the website for hours) and order drinks from the bar before you sit down for dinner.

{OVERALL}
I think it's a cool place to hang out for drinks but as for dining at the restaurant, I say go somewhere else (there are tons of options in vegas!).
