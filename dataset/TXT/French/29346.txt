We had trout, scallops and shrimp for apps.  Each great in their own way.  The trout evoked tartare, but was buttery and fresh.  The scallops were perfectly cooked and served on an onion cream sauce.  Overall very subtle flavors, with a hint of creaminess in each dish.

The mains, we had the liver and the fried chicken, were amazing.  There isn't much to say except that both are among the best exemplars of their kind.

Service was impeccable, and a recently expanded bourbon menu rounded off and incredible evening.

We will be coming back!
