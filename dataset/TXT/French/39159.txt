jrwRDE-QhvDGHLXaTMSJyA I had a great experience at Tria Terra, a restaurant in my area of town which I hadn't heard of before I bought a Groupon.  I approached the door thinking of the mixture of good and bad reviews I had read. But I had a soon to expire Groupon.  I was very pleased.  The food was really fabulous.  We shared the Caprese Salad and the Skewered Shrimp & Chicken tapas.  They were wonderful and the chicken, shrimp & zucchini were perfectly grilled and seasoned.  The bread is out of this world as is the pesto.  Also had the lamb panini and it was perfection.  We split a Tres Leche cake which was excelllent.  Our service was impeccable.  I am baffled at the reviews dissing this place unless they were slammed on the nights these diners visited.  I have no relationship with anyone associated with this restaurant.  You really should give it a try.
