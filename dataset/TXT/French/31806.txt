GS06uO84yKQpa7oezgVZgQ Visited here for dinner on a colleagues recommendation last Friday during a one night stay in Edinburgh. 

The place itself is tucked away on a little side street just behind George street (lots of lovely pubs). It is small, candlelit and plays the part of fancy little French bistro in every way! Menu can look a little pricey, but they have a cafe classics menu which offers two or three courses for a very reasonable £18/23 respectively. Not as many options, but I really enjoyed my meal! 

Starter of smoked beef with sundried tomatoes was light and fresh, with a lovely smokey flavour and served with peppery rocket. For main I had the venison Shepard's pie which was rich, gamey with meat that just melted in your mouth. Mash topping was smooth and salty, with just the right amount of crisp from a good grilling. Dessert was a perfect vanilla creme brûlée - any French restaurant worth its salt should be able to nail this dish, and cafe saint honore was no exception! 

Wine selection was varied and quite well priced, and staff was quite knowledgable in advising a selection to perfectly match my menu choices. 

Highly advise a visit if you are in Edinburgh! Booking recommended :)
