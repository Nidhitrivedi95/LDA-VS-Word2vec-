4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Real French people will cringe at the thought of this place, but, what can one expect, when there is a mock Eiffel tower outside? Obviously you should not expect anything authentic. 

We were given a buzzer and told it would only work within the immediate casino area, and not outside - a typical Vegas move to keep you roped in to the smokey casino space. There was a 40 minute wait (within the 30-45 minutes we were warned of) for us to get in, and even though we missed the breakfast deadline (being seated at 11 AM exactly), our waiter said we certainly could get breakfast. With that reassurance we ordered from the breakfast menu without a problem. The staff were courteous and constantly refilling our water and coffee, but I was "backhanded" every time. 

My cappuccino was somewhat weak and tepid, as was my girlfriend's coffee, which she described as "coffee flavored water."

My salmon eggs Benedict were tasty, as was the side of wheat toast and berry bowl. However, all of the hot food arrived at close to room temperature. 

Also, there was a frequent odor of sewage wafting our way. Not sure there's anything to be done about this, as we were seated outside, but still, it affected the experience.
