4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I love this place! Went here for my mom's birthday dinner with some of her friends who had been there before. I got the french onion soup which had to have been the best french onion soup of my life. For dinner, I had the entree sized scallops with brussel sprouts. I don't usually like brussel sprouts but this place happened to make them phenomenal. Overall, an excellent place. I'll definitely be going back. They also give you their recipes for certain things if you ask ;)
