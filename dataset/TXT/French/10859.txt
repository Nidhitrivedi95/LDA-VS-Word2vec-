4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Mon Ami Gabi, located in the Paris Las Vegas 

My husband and I decided to come here on our most recent trip to Las Vegas before catching Jersey Boys (now at the Paris.)  Reservations, while not required, definitely expedited our wait.  

Yes, there was still a little bit of a wait, even with reservations.  Probably about 15 minutes on a Saturday night, so not too bad at all.  

The bottled beer selection is pretty extensive as is the cocktail list.  

My husband was happy with his steak bearnaise and we both loved the fries.  I had the caesar salad, which was tasty.  The dressing was light and mild and my only complaint was that the salad was very small.  It should be listed as an appetizer salad, but I was under the impression that it was entree sized.  

The service was a little bit slow, but our waitress was adorable, friendly, and helpful when she was serving us.  

Make sure you follow the dress code, I saw some people being turned away for dressing too casually.  

Overall, good food, great location, and I would dine there again.
