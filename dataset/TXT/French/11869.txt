4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Really good steak. Sauce was good too. The fries some of us loved (they we're really thin) and some of us found them kind of hard to eat so they didn't even finish them. Staff was really nice and service was so quick, almost to quick. 45 minutes after we arrived we were done with our meal. Lovely atmosphere, though you we're kind of in need of a reading lamp to read the menu.
