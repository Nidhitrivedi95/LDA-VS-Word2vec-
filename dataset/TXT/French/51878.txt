pmoIMK8zGWvKsVOPDBYfzg I had a wonderful experience celebrating a friend's birthday here.

Delicious olive, tomato, regular butter with bread.

Scallops and Shrimp Scampi were excellent appetizers.

Duck, Ribeye, Black Cod, Salmon entrees...

but the Veal Tenderlion Medallions taught me what it means to truly eat something sinful...with thin herb pasta, cipollini onions, opal carrots and marsala veal jus, it was the perfect French meal in Vegas.

Caramel and Apple Bread Pudding with ice cream for dessert. 

Fabulous food before heading to XS.

Why does what happen in Vegas stay there? Please follow ME!
