d482l58ho0_IMdFkXX1F5Q My husband and I stopped in here late night for a quick meal. The hostesses were friendly and sat us right away. Our waiter was knowledgeable, efficient, yet kept his distance. Our Pinot Noir was chilled slightly and was perfect. We started with raw oysters and they were served with lemon and were perfect. I ordered the salmon rare and rarely to restaurants follow this request. The very outside was cooked and the inside was rare and warm. I give my dish a 10. My husband ordered the duck and I give his an 11. The flavor in the duck was phenomenal. It was cooked to perfection and the vegetables were delicious. Highly recommend this restaurant.
