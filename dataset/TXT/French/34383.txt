This is your typical overpriced restaurant with tiny, pretentious portions which I can't say are highly memorable.  The food is top quality and well-executed, but there's something left to be desired.  The sockeye salmon is a very good dish as is the filet beuf, but aside from the meat on the dish, all the other trimmings on the plate are uninspiring and simply there for fluff.  You leave the restaurant still feeling hungry with a large dent in your wallet.  Overall conclusion:  the food is not commensurate with the prices.
