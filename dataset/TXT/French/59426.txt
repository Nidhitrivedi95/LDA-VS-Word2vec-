rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w Who spends $150 on just 3 drinks, 1 dessert and 1 cheese plate?  That would be me.  Had the Freddy drink special, champage with rasberry puree (a crazy 22 each!) this praline mousse thing that comes in a ball and you pour chocolate and it melts and its all goodness inside.  And an excellent cheese plate with creative pairings (olive/plum tapanade, ginger spiced something or other).  Service is nice.  I don't gamble in Vegas, I only eat.  I will definitely come here next time for a full meal.
