nkHaix6KenApS8M-liZsCQ We have done happy hour midweek at least four different times recently. Each of those times we have been delighted by the food and atmosphere, and most of the time by the service. This time our teenage son wanted to take me out, his treat with hard earned summer job $$. We drove 45 minutes, arrived at 3 pm and it was pretty empty. A group finishing up in the main dining area, but no one in the bar, lounge or booths. We stood for a while waiting for someone to notice us.  The host arrived and said that for happy hour we could only sit in stools at the bar, or in the lounge. The long row of booth seating was empty, but we were not permitted to sit there, unlike every other time we have eaten here during happy hour.  He was actually kind of snotty about it. Well, not wanting to dampen the mood we ignored the tone and gave it a shot, but the heat coming off the stove next to us combined with really awkward /uncomfortable barstools made us ask if there was any way we could please sit in the empty seats. Again, a forceful no. Combined with the insinuation that I was lying about our past visits where we sat at the booth area during happy hour (petty and rude). At that point my son asked if we could just leave! The only other seating offered to us was the lounge area, and if you have been there you know about the posters that would make it awkward for us to sit there. Seriously. The weather was extremely hot and we just wanted a comfortable place to enjoy what we knew would be an amazing meal. Unfortunately, we had to leave. The "host" was such a snob, he needs to remember it's the customers that make a restaurant successful. Not turning people away from an EMPTY restaurant. The server who usually helps us was there (long hair) and ready to greet& prepare a table but for some reason we were deemed insignificant by the host. Gatekeepers can make or break a business, I hope the owners know what they are doing with this one.
