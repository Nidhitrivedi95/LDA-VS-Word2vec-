The waitstaff was nice but not overly efficient.  When filling our water glasses, the bus boy/assistant waiter noticed no one had brought our bread basket.  Luckily, we didn't want it.

We had the French Onion soup and three west coast oysters for appetizers.  The soup was great.  The oysters were good.

We had the duck confit and lamb as entrees, although the duck is an appetizer on the menu.  The duck is definitely a large enough portion to be an entree.  It was cooked perfectly but the confit was bland and there was not a salt shaker on the table (nor any of the others).  That's a pet peeve of mine that chefs think they have perfectly seasoned the food for every palate.

The lamb was done well, didn't see any eggplant on the plate unless it was the pear-tasting item on the plate.  There was also a very spicy pepper on the plate that was not expected.

We ordered the duck fries as a side item.  They were super bland.  We had to ask for salt and that did make them edible.

With all the choices in Vegas, I would choose to eat elsewhere.
