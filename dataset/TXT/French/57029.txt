rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I had dinner here last weekend, and decided to order the gnocchi since I had it at Bouchon in Yountville.  I thought it was either overcooked and or dry, so sent it back for another order since it was what I came here for.  The next order wasn't much better, and the waitress and manager apologized and comped me my dinner.  Even though I didn't like my food, I still give them 3 1/2 stars for trying to make it right and apologizing.  The other thing that was annoying was that we ordered bottled water, and they took it away from the table to keep it on ice.  Well the busboy or expediter kept coming over and pouring tap water from a pitcher into our glasses.  The waitress had to keep coming over and tell the busboy not too do that.The atmosphere is pleasant and my wife liked her mussels.  I will have to go back to Yountville to see if my taste buds were correct.  They insist that it is the same recipe.
