XI3iNUgChOfJk5ppjKVEQQ A recommended restaurant by a couple friends, we stopped in to celebrate our wedding.  The cheese plate to start was excellent.  Our appetizer was a tender grilled octupus salad.  She had lobster in a flavorful curry sauce.  My rib eye steak with chimichurri sauce met expectations.  Wine list provides good variety.  The music beautifully accented the ambience.
