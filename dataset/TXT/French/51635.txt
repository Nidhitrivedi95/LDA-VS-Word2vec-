pKiSzUlBBRNEdTML24piXA One of the best hidden spots in the city.  Look for the Centurion soldier outside and you've arrived.  One side is the bar with a large screen tv and a well stocked bar.  You can have dinner there or move to the small, intimate dining room.  We prefer the dining room since you can watch the chef prepare your food. Best food ever!  
Over a dozen different tapas plates priced under $10 dinners. The pictures dont lie.  It's good, really good. Our favs are the brie, lamb lollipops and foie gras.  Of course, we have never had anything bad here.  Tonight we had the mussels and lobster with cauliflower.  Both perfect!
Top notch service complimented with top notch food. We love Centurion!
