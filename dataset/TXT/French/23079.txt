bzbNGyrTwWHAgg1CqkSgeg The food is good but the service is horrible. I went in there once and the server was so unprofessional me and my friends didn't even see him other then when he took our order, the server serving at the table beside us had to go get us our drinks. Then when it was time for the tab the server charged me and my friend for the same tab, I called back twice to tell the manager what happened the first time he told me to wait second time I got out on hold then hung up on. If you are gonna eat here just get the food to go. Me and my friend both have bank account statements to prove that we were charged twice. The server that we wanted to tip didn't even get the tip that we left for him because the server messed up while charging the cards. I am a broke college student and now I am $67 short. That was going to go towards my water bill. Never again. The server should get fired, he started cussing right when he got to our table smh. HORRIBLE service.
