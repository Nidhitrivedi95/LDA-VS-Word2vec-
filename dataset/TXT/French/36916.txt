It's very quaint, they serve you warm, buttery homemade croissants with jam when you sit down, plus at the end of your meal, you get a complimentary dessert - which is different every time and is always delish. It keeps me coming back!

I've been here a few time for breakfast and lunch. I absolutely love their omelets - super fluffy! I've yet to find anything I love on their lunch menu, but nothing is bad either. 

Next time I go, I hope to go for dinner and try their pizza.

I come here often with my boyfriend who loves the croissants and dessert too - but it's the perfect place for a lunch with your girlfriends.
