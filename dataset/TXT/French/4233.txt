Let me start off by giving you fair warning 'DO NOT go here any later than 10pm' they have literally nothing left on the menu that's available other than the days left overs like  soups, some pasta dishes and basic chicken or fish. If you have your eyes and belly set on the coveted 'marrowbone with sea salt or quail' prepare to be disappointed. 
 
To add insult to injury we had a snobbish, stuck up French speaking waiter who completely ignored our existence. For the first time in a long time I felt like my skin color was to blame and my lack of the French language came in the way anyway I brushed it off but it was enough to make me sit there feeling pretty uncomfortable and disappointed. 

The star of the night was the  creme brûlée.
