sARavfidmIS878q5BtlyVQ Bravo!  The best meal to date in my lifetime.  It's definitely a once in a lifetime experience.  It was 20+ courses, I lost track after 7.  If you've been to Bazaar at LA, it's similar in the effect of molecular gastronomy dining.  Dinner is taken place in the chef's private kitchen counter.  It seats about 8 ppl.  It's a really cool room.  You get one on one time w/ the chef the entire experience so you can ask questions & make conversation if he's willing.  

The food was amazing, I'd highly recommend if you're willing to splurge & appreciate good food.  My favorite highlights of the dinner was the truffle cotton candy, fish brioche sandwich, cheese plate, lobster, and foie gras baked in salt(need I say more!)).  My favorite dessert is definitely the pan con chocolate - don't even know where to begin describing it.  

Yay, I have the best friends!  Hearts galore!
