YDb78yqVp5Dyx7zVr4POvA I like this Café, the décor and the location is really nice. Prices are reasonable and the service is friendly and efficient. 

What I don't like is the flavour of the food, or rather the lack of it. 
It is too bland for my taste. I ordered a Onion soup and a Croque Madame. 
Both times the bread was 'big' but small on actual flavour. 

adding salt 'n pepper does lift it up a bit, but I think base flavour should be there. True, this is subjective, but nonetheless annoying.
