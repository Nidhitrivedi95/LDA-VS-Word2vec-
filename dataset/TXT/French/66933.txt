USleI8g1UVN9-9jm-b4uIg Excellent restaurant! My first time dining in Charlotte was a great experience at The Fig Tree. You can eat outside on the front porch on a beautiful 80 degree evening.

The garlic spread was way too strong for me, but the Lobster Hush Puppies and Chorizo Stuffed Calamari were amazing. Ask for the Calamari to be pre-sliced for bite sized portions. I guess they normally serve it as one large piece, but our request for smaller pieces was nicely met. They should consider serving this way, as the presentation was quite nice.

The Grouper and Maine Lobster Tail over Rissoto really couldn't have been any better! Not fishy at all, and bursting with flavor!
