dDKhRQlw_OVsPLQAGAeNyA I've visited Montreal 3 times and have dined at Le Bourlingueur at least 4. We love this place! With a great location in the heart of old Montreal this place could easily get by with inflated prices and sub par food and service (ie La Sauvagine) However that's not the case, Le Bourlingueur serves Alsacian French food, that's wonderful and reasonably priced. I find Alsacian food somewhat of a German inspired French. Everything we've sampled there has been great. The place is comfortable and cozy with friendly service. The perfect place to have a nice dining experience in Old Montreal without breaking le banque.
