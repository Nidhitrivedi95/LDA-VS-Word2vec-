xeFVRUjxorxjO_qjX8FNdw It is a very small, crowded and noisy place to eat. We could barely understand the waitress when she was telling us the daily special because of her accent. The result was, she got annoyed when we keep asking her the same question.

My soup was lukewarm and the seafood pasta was loaded with black pepper and no good cook will do that.

We will never go there again.
