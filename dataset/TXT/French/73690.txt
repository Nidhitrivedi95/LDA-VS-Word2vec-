I was so excited to be able to see the Bellagio fountains go on right as we sat down and saw it twice more after that, so I guess we were there for an hour and a half. (the only bad thing about our meal... it took so long to get our food).

We came here for breakfast for our anniversary. First they give you a corn thing almost like a pudding, but it was sweet and a nice touch. We were also given small bread puffs that were delicious! I had the soufflé which was really good. It was a little bit hard at the bottom, seemed like a croissant type of thing. I really loved the top though, very light and delicious. The egg popped just perfectly over it all. It doesn't look very big but it was quite filling! Boyfriend had eggs Benedict. That was pretty good too, but how can that be bad at a high class restaurant? I had a strawberry lemonade that tasted like strawberries crushed in my cup. It was very strong and not very watery so it was gone real fast. I would not order that again... not worth 7 bucks.

At the end, we had some chocolate flutes rolled in powdered sugar and they weren't too sweet with dark chocolate on the inside. They also brought out a nice chocolate pudding out for our anniversary which was really nice. This place is very nice and romantic!! The service here is great! Constantly filling waters and making sure everything is okay.
