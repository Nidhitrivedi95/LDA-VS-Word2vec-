4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Really like this place. Came here about a year ago with my boyfriend at the time. It was considered an anniversary situation so we had reservations to sit outside in the patio area, overlooking the Bellagio and the fountain. Definitely a great location. If you sit for long enough, you might be able to catch quite a few fountain shows, which I always love =)

As for food, it was very delicious. We got the escargot to start off, which was amazing. Entree wise, I got a fish and he got a steak. I don't remember exactly what we ordered but both were amazing. Drinks were okay too, and dessert was good. I wish I yelped about this earlier so I would remember exactly what I ate, but this just means that I will have to come back again! The food was definitely very good, and I would come back anytime.

In addition, the service was really good too. Even though the restaurant was pretty packed on a Friday night, the waiter didn't kick us out or pressure us to leave, even though we ended up sitting for nearly 3hrs. Definitely worth going!!
