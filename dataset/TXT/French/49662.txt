or4UVDjXEEjze3wNPjoAZA The wife dragged me out shopping last weekend, and insisted on Zinc for lunch. I was skeptical at first, but as we made our way inside I was reassured by the atmosphere. We were able to get a table in their inside/outside section and it was really beautiful. A great day for lunch and I fully recommend eating in this part of the restaurant if you have the opportunity. 

The menu is very interesting and very French, ranging from steaks to sandwiches. I ended up going with the Confit Duck sandwich. The wife tried to talk me out it, "you always order duck and you never like it" she claimed. But there was something about sizzling pieces of dark duck meat sauteed in their own fat that just had my attention so I went for it. 

It came on a brioche bun, that was soft and delicious. The confit duck and pickled red onion was fabulous! I loved every bite. We had a side of frites (fries) that were also very delicious. That and a couple of beers on their inside/outside patio dealio with the sun shining and I could not complain. I will definitely be going back here again.
