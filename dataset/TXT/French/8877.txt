4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Despite arriving on Sunday slightly after breakfast was over, our waiter allowed us to order from the breakfast menu which was KEY to our experience. With two vegetarians, the main menu was less than interesting but the breakfast menu offered many more options. Kudos to awesome service!!

The cinnamon cream crepe/pancake was one of the best things I've eaten all year. Crispy crunchy super thin edges and lots of sweet cinnamon flavor with an awesome cream cheese frosting dollop. 

The bananas foster waffle was also well beyond average. Maybe one of the best waffles ever. Super light and airy inside but crunchy outside - perfection. Real house made whipped cream and tasty bananas Foster accompaniment. 

Friends who had the seafood omelette and veg omelette also were very happy. 

I expected it to be an overhyped Vegas restaurant but it was truly a great experience.
