I had the scallops which were the best I've ever had, and I order scallops often! Perfectly cooked and seasoned. 
My table shared a cheese board then split two different veggie side dishes. Everything was incredible. 
I had wine but the cocktails also looked amazing. Definitely recommended! Not cheap ($$-$$$) but so worth it!
