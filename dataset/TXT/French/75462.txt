Ycp3Agr7dt71TZkeKV7jng This place really do have fantastic cookies! My chocolate chip cookie was devoured in seconds! I'm so glad I picked it up when paying for the Bombay Mac & Cheese, which was not impressive. 

It was the special of the day, but the dish was lukewarm and lacked flavor. It tasted more like watered down curry pasta rather than Mac and cheese.

Service was A-Ok. Cashier was brisk as would any other takeout place. There are a couple of tables for dining in but most customers were getting take out.

Though the cooked food isn't too great, I will certainly be back to have more of those amazing cookies!
