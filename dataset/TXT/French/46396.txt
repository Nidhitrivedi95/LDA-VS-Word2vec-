Nf9YGbWIwNMEv41J52g3tQ Situated in the Village neighbourhood, this cute restaurant offers hearty, classic French bistro food. The servers are friendly and attentive without being overbearing. The portion sizes are very good. My friend and I tried the five course tasting menu for $35 per person and we were stuffed by the end of the meal. I recommend the "quenelles de brochet" (pike quenelles) which were light and fluffy, served with a delicious cream sauce. Even though the restaurant was busy (we went on a Saturday evening), we received each of our courses in a reasonable amount of time. Well worth a visit!
