exz9aZqMqjpqzUOFBAl9Gg I was there during lunch with my boss and we always have the same thing Penney Alla Gigi.... It was delicious!!! Penne pasta with a little spicy crramy rosé sauce. 

Their lunch portion price is great! $12 it comes with soupe of the day or salad and coffee! Think about it, it's just $4 more than McDonald. But you'll be comfortably seated, with service and a lot more healthier. 

Service. Maybe we were there a bit earlier than the usual crowd, we got there quarter to noon. Everything went in a timely fashion, foods arrive hot and tasty! But actually impressed me was the waiter. We were on a hurry to a meeting, so we told our waiter we didn't want the coffee even though it was included in our meal. The waiter brought us the bill along with 2 coffees in a takeaway cup. Now this is what I call thoughtful.

Way to go!
