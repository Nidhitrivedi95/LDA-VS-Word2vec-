FRuuIDOd21pTJHvEGIt1Gg Came here on a last minute reservation and found it about 2/3 full on a weeknight.  So not exactly a hotspot, but I got the feeling it's one of a family of restaurants by the same owner.  The food was good but not inspiring. Service was fine though the waitress was a little hyper.  Okay in a pinch but there are probably better choices for food and atmosphere with a little planning.
