6GCbZASjMnAPYBWLc_z30g Thought Saturday night would be busy at 6:00 PM, but to our surprise it was just getting started. We don't like to go there too often because it seems that a lot of older folks go there, not that I'm a "spring chicken".

The waiter was efficient, he never told us his name but memorized our order. He made sure we had our drink glasses filled at all times.

When he brought out the bread, it was only three pieces of different types: roll, carrot bread and another type. We had to ask for another order.

My daughter had the Chicken Pot Pie which had chunks of chicken but the sad part, the crust was only on the top, which was golden brown. To her it was OKAY. My wife had the petite sirloin steak which came with a salad and asparagus. She ordered it medium rare and it was a little too pink, but still eatable. My order was the Lamb Shank on top of mashed potatoes and asparagus. Love asparagus!! The lamb was okay and portion was just right. The sauce that was poured over the lamb was like beef stew gravy with carrots and celery. The sauce was a bit salty for me but bearable. If you looked at the lamb shank you would mistaken it for a turkey drumstick.
