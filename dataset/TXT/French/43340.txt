LtDYRcMJbJPhXPEklT29Fw The soufflé desert here is one of the best deserts I've had anywhere! My pasta dish was good but kind of bland, as were the frog legs my partner got. He loved the tartare however as well as the main course he ordered. Since the food ranged from just good to excellent, given the prices I debated weather to give it 4 or 5 stars but went with 5 just because the desert was THAT good. The drinks were also good, but I think its a lot easier to make good drinks than it is food. The service was exceptional, the decor nice and a good location. Looking forward to coming here again.
