fVF5wayDyY6ZR5oJB1IK3g Went for Sunday brunch. I appreciate the way the handle not taking reservations. You show up, your number is taken down and you get a call when your table is ready. It helps that there are tons of shops up and down St. Laurent while you wait. 
As for the food, they offer a good variety of interesting brunch options. The portion sizes were good. When the food arrived, it was good but not great. The coffee is bottomless which is nice p. 
In addition I found the space that they occupy less than ideal, it is crowded, loud, and too open. Not having double doors on the winter really doesn't work. My date and I were both rather cold from the constant draft from the door, taking away from the dining experience. 
Overall, I found Lawrence to be slightly overrated. I went once and would think twice before going again because of the price.
