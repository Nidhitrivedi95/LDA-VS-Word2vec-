YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g Small plates seem to be the trend and Hubert Keller is making his effort to that trend in what used to be Fleur De Lys, the Vegas branch of his highly rated San Francisco dining establishment.  I've eaten many times at both the SF establishment and the FDL in Vegas.  I have now had two meals in the converted Vegas house now simply called "Fleur".

OK, it's a bit pricy for a small plates joint but really, the food is very good.  On my last visit the service may have been a bit too attentive but that's probably because they weren't all that busy for mid week lunch.  Food comes out quickly and is very tasty but, as mentioned in another review, isn't all that large.  I think the price/value perception would be better if they added a bit more food on the plate.  There were two of us at the table and one of the dishes order was the tuna tacos.  They're small, no doubt but what really bugs me is that 3 sub-mini tacos were served.  3 would be good for a single diner, what if there's 4 people at the table, someone looses and if there's 2 people, well try cutting a micro hard shell taco.  

Our bill was $120 bucks for two, including some drinks (sangria,  $35 for a carafe).  We had 4 different dishes.  It's amazing how small changes can change the perception of price/value.
