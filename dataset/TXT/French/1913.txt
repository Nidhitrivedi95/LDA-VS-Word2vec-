0JGMKaKJGVuDus5WcJzvjw Probably one of the best meals I have had in a long time.  Wait staff was fantastic!  Order a Bloody Mary with a raw Oyster (beautiful).  Dishes at our table included the 1/2 Roasted Chicken (sauce was to die for), Roasted Duck (Another sauce to die for), Oysters on the half shell (they don't get better than these), Rabbit (perfectly prepared).  If they are making the brussel sprouts and you don't like brussel sprouts...think again this was one of the best dishes I had ever tasted.  Don't forget dessert...Toffee pudding or a tart.  Thank God we couldn't get reservations at Joe Beef!  Soon the Liverpool House will be impossible to get into as well.  Next trip to Montreal, book an evening and prepare to be delighted!
