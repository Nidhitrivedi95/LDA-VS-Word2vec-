j0baDQfMAGDm_QGdFMmb-Q We had a great evening at this neighborhood restaurant. If you've been to France you will feel the authenticity.  If you haven't, visit to understand the real thing.  Amazing husband/wife team hosts your evening. The mussels Provençal were a dream. Short wine list, but authentically French and quite accessible.  They shake a great martini.  Try this lovely place!!
