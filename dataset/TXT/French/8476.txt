4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I couldn't wait to write this review.  We were in Las Vegas a few months back and I can't believe it took me this long to post this review.  

We frequent VEGAS a lot!!  and we have never eaten here. I cannot believe I missed this Gem.  The breakfast I had was hands down the best breakfast I have ever had in Las Vegas.  Actually best I have ever had period.   Literally their eggs benedict was the best I have ever eaten.  They had a special that weekend where the eggs benedict had strip steak.  OMG OMG.... the bomb...words can't describe, it melted in your mouth and the Hollandaise sauce is PERFECT.  Just writing about it makes me want to go back now...it is that good.  Perhaps I was there on a good day, don't know, but everything was great. Fresh OJ, great coffee... good looking waiters...just perfect.... My sister's  breakfast was exceptional as well.  Basic but good, baguette with butter, yummy, she had the mushroom omelet with brie cheese and chives...I had a taste and it was also AMAZE...the brie and chives just really mesh.  If I had to pick a stand out it would be the Hollandaise sauce  :) 

Additionally you cannot beat sitting outside on the strip with a view of the water show at the Bellagio and people watching...just a perfect setting for a VACAY  :)
