4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw BEST restaurant I've been to in Vegas. Service, atmosphere, location, and food were all absolutely great. This is located right off the strip right across the street from the Bellagio where the fountains are, so when the fountain started going off we could see it very quickly, which was a great site to see while enjoying great food. Everyone was so nice there and were very accommodating, they made sure we were all comfortable and we knew the menu and even made suggestions as to what was great there. Every single dish and drink I had there was also so great. I had their poutine, a drink, and their steak dish. I can hands down say that they have the best steak I have EVER tasted in my whole entire life. Their fries also paired so well with the steak, they were perfectly crisp and amazing. I had the poutine gabi, au poivre steak frites, and French martini. This will definitely a place that I will have to go to again once I'm back in Vegas!
