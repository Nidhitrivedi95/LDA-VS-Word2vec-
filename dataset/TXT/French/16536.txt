8ciT6qjI18x9EPtOb-gqYQ Coup des Tartes is clean fresh French food. The summer menu was perfect. I enjoyed the Chevre Tomata appetizer and the pasta. My husband enjoyed the soup de jour and the peppered filet. I was shocked he even enjoyed the capers. The "hash brown potatoes" and spinach were a perfect accompaniment. Our bill was $84 without tip including corkage. I love that the restaurant is BYOB with amazing food. I decided it must be moved into my regular rotation even if it is a bit of a drive for us. They also run Groupon specials.
