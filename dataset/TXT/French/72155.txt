XKPosZx2j4RHcZ8Ewdwj0A i just came back from Montreal, and maybe i had high expectations.  After all, Montreal is voted #2 food city in North America.  I'm so proud of our lovely San Francisco is being voted #1 food city in North America!

I picked this place because of $22 menu (appetizer and entree) after 22:00.  It is a very nice restaurant with outdoor seating.  I highly recommend to reserve a outdoor seating because inside can be a little hot during summer.  we had snails and house made potted "rillettes" for appetizers.  Both are just a-ok, but for $22, i really shouldn't complain.  For entrees, we had hanger steak and sea salt salmon "pot au feu".  i highly recommend to stay away from those two entrees.  we asked for medium rare for steak, but it was burned outside, and well down inside.  the salmon pot au feu came out really really bland and a little fishy.  It turned out our bottle of wine is the highlight of the dinner.
