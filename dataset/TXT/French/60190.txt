SBnpT6JDbah-5l_52GM5sw Wonderful ambience and setting on lake with seating on a narrow, outdoor terrace.  Charming, exposed beams, stone- walled bar-back with subway tiles reminiscent of a true french brasserie interior.  Beautiful open kitchen, wood-oven and pure bistro menu.  Incredible Bloody Mary with olive, minced jalapeño-radish garni, cornichon and pickled slice of fennel/ how festive and eye candy-ish, with beer chaser!  What a deal!  Mouth-watering brunch menu , only negative is that the service can be very slow.  Parched for my cocktail!  Go- you will love it.
