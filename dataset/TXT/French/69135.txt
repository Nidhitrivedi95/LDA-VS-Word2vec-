Gaby Et Jules' macarons are delicious and perfectly shaped; shows true talent by the chef I think. I tried:
coffee
earl grey 
lemon
lavendar
rose
pistacio

Fillings are very delicious, and they're pretty sweet so while they're expensive, as dessert you probably would only have 2 max at a time (I think at least). Would be great with an indulgent tea with the girls. Best eaten same day I think, but you can refrigerate as they say and let it come back to room temp before you eat. It's not quite as snappy/crispy the next day, but it's not a big deal.
