oS96aJIHFWcFAlGHKKXjaw I heard about this bakery from a friend and I decided to grab a variety of items to bring to a morning picnic.

I got the vegetarian quiche (which has goat cheese!), clafoutis, citrus tart, fruit tart(my personal favorite!), and a few chouquettes all for around $16. In my experience french bakeries are usually more expensive, but everything was super delicious and I would totally recommend this place to a friend.

Overall great price and quality!
