q0n4I-zqiI47xispOqc1lA Just finished a very disappointing brunch here. We were seated right away but then waited 5 minutes for menus and water. We had to flag down the waiter to order. We ordered 2 plain crepes for our 3 year old, a Cobb salad for me and a buffalo chicken crepe with a salad for my husband. I asked for strawberries on the side for the crepes and was happy to see avocado on the Cobb salad description. I ordered a $3 ice tea. Our food was brought in a short amount of time. The plain crepes arrived as French toast. The Cobb salad was lacking avocado and had gross turkey deli meat laid over the top. I instantly recognized it from Costco. I dug into the salad and found the avocado.... dollops of Costco guacamole. I tried to eat around it but it was smeared on all the half wilted greens. My husband's crepe was fine. The salad was just greens and vinaigrette. My daughter's erred French toast was fine but not worth the cost of the meal. My ice tea was never refilled, no one checked on our meals, and the bill was $50. What a waste.
