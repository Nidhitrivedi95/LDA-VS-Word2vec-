HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw Two words Scottish Salmon. Ridiculously flavorfull. Good stuff! My friends got 48oz steak to share and ordered it well done..45 minutes later their stake came out pink as hell. Lol so that didnt go over well. The manager came and comp'd it but they didn't fix the steak. The crab cakes were pretty good and the spinach dip.

Eh it's an okay place. I enjoyed my meal. They also have some tasty pomme frites. The employees are courteous as well.
