DZkl5MleRKh0isxj1Y2Abg Our server was amazing, very detailed and to the point. Accommodated our needs and was very outgoing, which enhanced the experience as a whole. I must say the food was amazing, but there's definitely space to improve. The Ttoro and Foie Gras was just fantastic and so was the creme brûlée. My critic is also my praise, in regards to the place itself, which is just a tad bit too small, making it hard to have a nice conversation without overhearing your neighbour's conversation and vice verse. However having said that, its also because its so petite that you have a very warm, friendly and cozy atmosphere. Definitely recommend to those who wants a romantic evening out in the Yorkville area.
