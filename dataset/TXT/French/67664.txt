UxWH8zRYIBgs6Q2oykvRdw First time coming to this place. My cousin wanted to try a french restaurant and i wanted to take her to the distillery so that's when I decided to give cluny a try.

First off, LOVE the interior!!!!!! Looks very french. The  ceiling, the flooring, the bathroom is beautiful!

We went there for brunch so we tried bourbon pecan pancakes, ricotta stuffed french toast and crab cakes Benedict.   All delish!  The crab cakes is a must!

The coffee they serve it in an individual french press which was so cute. 

I still have to come back and try the rest of the menu.

This is a must go hands down!
