0txNpCq2YunZSL7jHIiGlA Th, context: Friday night and plan had broke; so my husband and i decided to walk to roncy to grab a bite instead.  Lardon, small resto, not totally empty and not totally full that we would be turned away or asked to wait.

Atmosphere: 3/5, casual, not pretentious which I like

Value: Food is  very good value.  We got a free creme brulee with purchase of two mains. Drinks were a little over priced..  particular the beer and cocktails.

The food: But the pork belly was divine.  The shrimp croquettes was something we would not get again.... but that pork belly was another story- super crisp skin and tender buttery flavourful meat.  Makes total sense that the pork belly would be yummy..with a name like lardon... you almost expect it.
Would I go back?  Probably
