in3zjiaLpNzr9G3K35gAJQ If you love French cooking, Vincents Bistro has a wonderful array of brunch and lunch selections.  Firstly, their coffee is heavenly.  Many tables at our Sunday brunch were ordering from the drink menu.  I had the poached eggs florentine, which was very good.  My husband had an omelet with ham and gruyere cheese but did share later that it was overcooked and the gruyere was almost absence.  The buttery rolls they serve before the meal are delicious--hot and fresh from the oven.  They give everyone a complimentary small dessert after your meal.  Our table had a selection of a fresh brownie topped with vanilla ice cream, a lemon bar with blueberries and creme brulee.  Their creme brulee is to die for!  The restaurant is frequented by a lot of old times--I imagine they've been heading to Vincents for many, many years.  The service is excellent and the wait staff seems to know a lot of the patrons.  Overall, the restaurant prices are very reasonable, especially given the warm rolls and a complimentary dessert.  However, the sound level can be quite loud at times, and there is a real need for some updating of their restaurant's decor.  If you don't mind these last two elements, the food and service will rarely disappoint.
