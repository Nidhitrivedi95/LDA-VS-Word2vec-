xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g So I just got back from LV and I neeeded to yelp every place I went to starting with the Eiffel Tower Restaurant. 

We were late for our reservation, but still they were friendly and seated us right away. We took our time with the Wine List (which is a NOVEL!) and they were very helpful in trying to find the perfect wine for us. 

The Service was EXCELLENT!!! Top notch!! Our waiter was so funny and totally went along with all of our jokes. I looooved this place. 

Oh right, so I got the Beef Wellington, it was really delicious, but wayyy too herby. My friend got a Filet Mignon and she was in loooove with it. All the other girls I was with loooved their dishes as well. We all ordered different dishes and it was marvelous...

Duck 2 ways
Filet Mignon
Beef Wellington (me)
and two fish dishes I can't remember right now....but it looked and smelled greatt!!!

At the end we got a souffle and although it wasn't what we were expecting (the quick deflation with the pouring of cream and chocolate) it was still yummmmy. 

All in all, great experience and had a GREAT time! =)

Oh and we had a great view of lovely couples in love taking pictures and eating all romantically *insert sarcasm here* -____________-

We were a group of 5 bitter and angry girls...hahahaha

oh, the water show wasn't too bad, but it just isn't the same without the "Cause I'm proud to be an American, where at least I know I'm freeee" song.
