UxWH8zRYIBgs6Q2oykvRdw A solid 3.5--mostly because of the decor and the service. The food...meh. If you order the steak frites, don't expect a whole steak (a few slices at best). The daytime menu is depressing if what you're hoping for is bistro fare. And the drinks...inventive but watered down. Maybe I'll come back for the dinner service just to be in the atmosphere is a great space, but my expectations aren't high for the food.
