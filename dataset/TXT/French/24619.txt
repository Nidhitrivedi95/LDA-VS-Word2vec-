cNkm08qu--yjIY_NPxrS2g Was reluctant to go there again after a very bad initial experience I had last summer when I went for diner shortly after it's opening. The big issue at the time was the lack of organization and the service that took forever. Food was alright.

This time I went for brunch on a beautiful and sunny Sunday. The place was full but we were immediately assigned to our table which was at the window with an amazing view. The food again was good however the service was still below expectations for a place like this; lots of comings and goings with waiters forgetting coffees and beverages and coming back to double check on the order..

The prices are affordable for what you eat.

In my opinion, the only factor making this place popular is its location on the last floor of the Ville Marie Bldg with an amazing view on Mtl
