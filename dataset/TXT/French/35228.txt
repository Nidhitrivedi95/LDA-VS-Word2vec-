Ht-_i0UAq7YDBaqJwcQMdQ We had the pleasure of dining here tonight. What an amazing experience. The ambiance had such a cool vibe to it. With great music and dark walls and decor features, the space felt immediately welcoming and exciting.

Here in low season, we were given a lucky break, as we were able to score a table on the same day we dined. 

We started out with the venison and the scallops. The venison was so tender, with a perfect sear and an immaculate flavor. The berries on the side were just magnificent. The scallops, although not great in quantity, were perfectly cooked. The lemon sauce, drizzled over the top, really complimented the flavor of the scallop. I wanted more! 

Our dinner entrees were the lamb, again, cooked perfectly and seasoned to perfection and the boar, an unexpectedly tender delight, on a bed of walnuts and oh, that puree!!!! 

For dessert, we chose Strates and Venus. The richness of the raspberry compote, paired with the caramel flavors of Strates really got us going, whereas the calmer, refined taste of the pistachio cake in Venus, coupled with the delicate flavor of rosewater syrup and the sweetness of the lychee sorbet, made me feel happy to be alive. 

The staff was amazing throughout this experience. Everyone was so professional and adorable and were were welcomed from start to finish. It was worth every penny to me. I cannot wait to return.
