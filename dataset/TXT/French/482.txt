-Mz3M0g6iFZczs6a7ddf5g We gave this place a try after seeing it on many must eat lists for Montreal. We were pretty impressed with our food-though we only ordered one entree each and our waiter kept informing us that it would not be enough food (it was plenty). We ordered the tagliolini, the veal risotto, another pasta dish with pork, and the ravioli. The dishes were all excellent and unique. My biggest disappointment was my $12 Cosmo that tasted like water, so I don't suggest ordering a cocktail. Stick with wine instead. I greatly enjoyed our dinner but it is a pricy place. Also, we had trouble finding the place so yes the shady side door is the entrance.
