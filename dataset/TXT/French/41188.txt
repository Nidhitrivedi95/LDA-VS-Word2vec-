kGOr_D-LNpgZ2M9N8TT4QQ The plan was to come here for their Summerlicious lunch but because we booked lunch on a weekend, we did not realize until much later that they were only serving brunch and not lunch. Regardless, my friends still wanted to check it out. I was a little apprehensive at first because brunch is my favorite meal and I have a list of brunches that I want to try out, and La Société was not on my list. But I still went anyway. When I arrived at the restaurant, it really did feel like a French bistro and it had a beautiful decor. 

Once I found my friends I sat down and browsed through their menu and for some reason I was really craving a croissant. So I ordered a croissant with a side of cream cheese. My friends on the other hand ordered the French toast, quiche, eggs Benny and the ricotta pancakes. Each plate looked delicious and every single one of my friends was happy with their choice. Except for me. A croissant just seemed so plain and it was cold and not buttery enough for me. But as luck would have it, several of my friends could not finish their food so I got to eat their leftovers. Yeh! **Oh yeah, that was the plan after all. ;) 

I would have to say that favorite dish from all the dishes that my friends ordered  was the French toast. I could not get over how fresh the bread tasted. 

Now, would I return? Probably not. As I mentioned before, I have a list of brunch establishments  that I want to try, and this brunch was not good enough for me to pay them a second visit. 

My friends will definitely disagree with my observation and are probably planning their return to this restaurant as I type this.
