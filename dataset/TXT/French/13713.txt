4O8fzz9F-XEsQ-gTMgkiyQ Stopped in here during the Grand Prix Weekend. They had the street roped off and some music playing outside. We wanted a glass of Mumm so we figured we would sit down and have something small before we met friends at dinner elsewhere. We ordered some wine and the Champagne and a dish of risotto. That short 40 min experience was enough to get us to come back the next night for a full dinner. The risotto was amazing and everything else we ordered was amazing too. The service was friendly but a little bit slow at times. This was probably due to the amount of people in the place. Regardless of that, I would come back here anytime, and if you are in the area you should stop in and try it!
