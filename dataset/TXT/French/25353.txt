Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA I have been looking forward to come here for a few years but never had a reason to until this year... and I went twice! It's a nice bar but the main feature is definitively the view! It sit on top of THEHotel at Mandalay Bay ans has a great view from the strip looking north. It has an outside area that can get quite windy as it was the case that week. Otherwise, i found that it was loud and generally expensive unless you go for a private party and don't have to pay (this was my case both times).
