SFnrHuVFSNiondFVUBLJZQ Came for a dessert crepe on an evening and we tried 'La Jamaicaine' which had banana, ice cream, and Belgian chocolate sauce. The fixings were delicious but the crepe was a bit tough and chewy.  It seemed to have been made ahead of time and reheated.  A bit disappointed. First time there so not sure if it was an off night.  The service was very good and friendly.
