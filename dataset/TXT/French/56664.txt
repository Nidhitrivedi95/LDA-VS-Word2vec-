rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A one word...Divine. I went there right before they were closing and they still seated me and were some of the friendliest staff. 
Then the food...Onion soup, perfect! 
Croque Madame...melts in your mouth
French fries...worth flying to Vegas for...Seriously.
Profiteroles with a gravy server filled with the best hot chocolate ever...to die for. 
Fly. Take a bus. Get there...
Prices?Not that bad for the Quality of food.
