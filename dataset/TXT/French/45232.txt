mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q my friend and i decided to do one fine dining a month (since we are both new locals), and this is our second place (strip steak was first). although most of the time we didn't know what we were eating, we enjoyed our time and watched the people prepared and explained the food to us. we are such country pumpkins but rest assured, by the end of the year, we'd learned our manners and refine our palates. great french bread basket, quail and dessert : )
