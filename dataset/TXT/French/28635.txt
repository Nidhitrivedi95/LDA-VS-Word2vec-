eJ9L40jm5VOXCIq7xs9kQw If I was forced to complain about Auberge Bonaparte I would be hard pressed to come up with something. 

My friend and I were staying at the hotel and breakfast is included with the room. I have stayed in many hotels that include breakfast and have come to expect free breakfast = mediocre food at best. Not here! To start we each had the fruit cup....which was lovely. Then I had the French toast. Outstanding in every respect. The crusty French bread, the hint of orange (Grand Marnier?), tiny side of whipped cream, real maple syrup, all cooked to perfection. But wait! There's more! As part of the breakfast menu you can opt for a croissant or other bread. I don't remember the other bread options, once they said croissant I was sold. Also in the bread basket are two mini muffins. I did not have the muffin as I was totally full. My friend ate one and she reports the muffin was excellent. Just to round things out, the breakfast includes orange juice and coffee/tea. 

I hope I have conveyed my appreciation of the food. (So good I ordered the same thing on back-to-back days.). I would also like to mention the setting is lovely. It didn't hurt sitting at the window overlooking the street and quaint older buildings. And finally, the wait staff was truly outstanding. I am sorry not to call out specific people but everyone was great. 

As I mentioned breakfast was included with the hotel room. However, for walk-ins it is $15. Easily worth that if I were staying elsewhere. Overall a great dining experience.
