10cjlsUzS8rAKMjdEWbxvA Loved this place. A bit of a diamond in the rough of that area. Started with the Charcuterie to share amongst the three of us. Wonderful while chatting and sipping a wine. I thoroughly enjoyed my Salmon entrée but was able to share the steak that my wife had and would order that next time. The duck was also delicious and I enjoyed that as well. Service (by Patrick) was discreet and relaxed to fit the ambiance. Worth a trip to that part of town for food from a genuine French chef and owner Pascal.
