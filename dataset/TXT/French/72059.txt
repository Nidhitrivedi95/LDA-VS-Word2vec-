XKPosZx2j4RHcZ8Ewdwj0A We did the $25 at 22.  Great deal but...Unique presentation on the appetisers with escargot on tube pasta and panko encrusted goat cheese salad with walnuts. The latter was a hit. The former though different was okay but not wow. 

Main dishes were just okay. We've had better at Le Selecte in Toronto. Duck confit was mostly tender with some dry bits, but wasn't that flavourful.  Steak frites was also just okay. A bit on the tough side.  But the frites were really great. The potatoes were sweet, crispy on the outside and mushy on the inside. Nice!  Too bad it was the highlight of the dinner.

The French Toast and Creme Brûlée were both pretty good.  But after all the hype about this restaurant, we were hoping for something more...
