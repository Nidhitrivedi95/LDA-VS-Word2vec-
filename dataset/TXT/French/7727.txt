4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Croque Monsier & Prime Steak Sandwich was absolutely top notch. Perfect lunch portions. 

This place has great seating inside and out, service is wonderful. I recommend a strawberry spritzer and the bloody mary. (It comes with bacon and cheese!) 

Great views, food and service. Make reservations for outdoor seating
