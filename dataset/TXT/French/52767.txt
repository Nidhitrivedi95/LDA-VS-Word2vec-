Qc8kNFkr5q4xNah4iC0haw We stayed at the George Hotel while we were in Edinburgh, and ended up eating here twice for breakfast and twice for dinner.

The first dinner we had here was to die for.  My rozmopolitan cocktail was to die for, and they made my husband a great drink as well.  The smoked salmon appetizer was delicious-- the potato blinis were the perfect vehicle for the salmon, and the horseradish creme wasn't overpowering.  For entrees, I had the four herb fettucine with steak and loved it.  The noodles were definitely closer to linguine than fettucine, but the sauce was light and delicious and the beef filet pieces were grilled very well.  My husband had the filet and said it was excellent; the fries that came with had a great balsamic sauce on top and the onion rings were a delicious bonus.

Our second dinner was less exciting, but still very good.  We both had steaks; my sirloin was cooked perfectly at medium, but his ended up more medium well than medium rare, which was very unfortunate.

The breakfast is a standard Scottish breakfast, but everything is done very well.  The eggs are fresh, the sausage is great, and there's a wide selection of fruit.

Service is great at both mealtimes, and the vibe is classy without being stuffy.

I'd highly recommend Tempus, especially if you are staying at the George.
