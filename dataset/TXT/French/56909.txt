rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A For our second night out in Vegas, we went with the hubby's second-favorite chef, Thomas Keller.  The walk through the hotel was in itself an experience as no expense was spared in making the Venetian spectacular!  We arrived at the doors of Bouchon and were greeted immediately by the host.  Our waitress greeted us within minutes of being seated and brought a pair of deliciously well-made martinis.  While she was getting our cocktails, the busboy brought bread and water.  We discussed the menu at length with our waitress and decided on starting with a salad course:   Salade Lyonnaise from the menu and the Beet Salad from the specials board - both were delicious.  Our appetizer course was Escargots à la Bourguignonne and the Confit de Canard - my first experience with escargots and they were exquisite (as was the duck)!!  Entree course consisted of Truite Almadine and Gnocchi a la Parisienne - OMG!  Both were exceptional.  Unfortunately, we were entirely too full to attempt dessert.  

I noticed that this and other restaurants in Vegas feature breakfasts and brunches - please do yourselves a favor - eat breakfast at a breakfast joint - save the celebrity chef restaurants for fine dining and then you won't be disappointed - the hotels are clearly insisting that these restaurants provide service all day but really...not many chefs are famous for what they make for early meals - they're known for dinner.

The odd thing about Bouchon is that it is true to the French Bistro style, but it is in a hotel that is reimagining Italy, it was odd to find a French restaurant.  Not complaining though, Mr Keller creates some of the best French food this side of the pond!
