qltrxd6_usFu1Q0mM5ZCNQ I went there for Montreal table. Foods I had there were oily and salty to me. It would be better if I had a glass of wine. I only liked dessert there after eating the foods and the presentation. The presentation was amazing. Staffs there kind and friendly. 

Also I recommend to seat far from open kitchen to some people who just like me. I seated next to the open kitchen I was too warm and I felt that the air wasn't fresh. My clothes smells like a restaurant.
