dd3GZs6zW2t7BM0cbxAzvg I would come here all the time if I lived in Toronto. I've been to tons of restaurants all over the U.S. and France, and this is up there with the top of them.

- Great atmosphere. Small and comfortable, without feeling as pretentious as some French places can sometimes be.
- Wonderful service. Prompt, friendly, and really helpful with making food choices or selecting the right wine pairing.
- Fantastic food. Everything we got from the appetizer and entree menu was delicious. I had the horse tenderloin -- and if you like beef and just want something a tiny bit gamier -- I highly recommend it.
