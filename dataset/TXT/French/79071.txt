ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug Truly horrible. The food is exceedingly overpriced even by Vegas standards for subpar quality. My boyfriend and I ordered steak dinners that were worse than Denny's. At least Denny's doesn't charge you up the you-know-what. For two overdone steaks with supposedly "steamed" vegetables thar were in fact raw, we paid over 50 bucks. We might as well have gone to a quality steakhouse for a few more dollars. The service is below low. There was one poor guy working half the entire restaurant and it was only 10pm. The hostesses were flat out rude and we would NEVER go back again.  They need to get get their act together pronto.
