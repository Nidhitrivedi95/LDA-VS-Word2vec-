OBr_LF6vOD23wP17YNtOag A group of us visiting Edinburgh for the Rock and Roll half marathon visited Hewat's on our first evening in the city. What a wonderful experience. 

The staff welcomed us when we arrived, took our coats and seated us promptly. 

Our dinner was delicious. Everyone enjoyed their food. I had the beet and goat cheese salad as a starter, and wild boar for the main dish. The boar was juicy and flavorful. A companion of mine, who is usually rather particular about beets, thought the salad was extraordinarily good. He also described his duck breast entree as tasting the way duck should taste. 

The other people in our group loved their seafood, saying the salmon, sea bass, and prawns tasted fresh caught, and were the best they ever had. For dessert, I had a great sticky toffee pudding. Another companion had the creme brulee and enjoyed that. 

Overall, Hewat's had a comfortable atmosphere, a friendly and attentive staff, and fantastic food. The next chance we get to visit this lovely country, we will be back to Hewat's.
