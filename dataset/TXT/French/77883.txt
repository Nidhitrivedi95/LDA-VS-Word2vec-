YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g I went to this place mainly due to the lovely combo of a restaurant.com certificate and  staying at the Mandalay Bay (hooray for cheapness and laziness). At first blush, the menu seemed a little limited, but all I wanted was a steak and beer, so it fit my needs. The decor was nice, but I'm one of those folk who really doesn't care about decor...focus should be on the food...but I digress. I ate at the bar mid-afternoon, since I was travelling solo, and had a pleasant conversation with the bartender. All in all, a decent if not overly impressive experience.

The reason why I give it 5 stars is the service from the management. In the middle of a convo with the bartender, the manager came by with a free appetizer of the onion soup shooter and apologized for the wait for the steak. Apparantly it was cooked well beyond my instructions and he intercepted it before it was served. Honestly, I hadn't noticed the delay in service, but I very much appreciated the offer. That was pretty impressive to me, just a regular schlub in a t-shirt and jeans eating solo at the bar. Maybe my expectations for dining are a bit low, but that was above and beyond to me. The onion soup shooter I ended up liking more than the steak! Not that the steak was bad, but the onion soup app was that much better in my opinion.

Overall, excellent food, great and pleasant service, and an overall easygoing atmosphere. The prices are a little high, but nothing out of the ordinary for the Vegas strip. Definitely will recommend to other folk and will likely visit again.
