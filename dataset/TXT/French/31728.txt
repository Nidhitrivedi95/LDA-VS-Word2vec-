grHISDkIGwttYthhW8DxCQ Well.. Only the crepes are gluten free (not the waffles) and oh did they neglect to mention (before they rang my order through on my credit card) that NONE of the sweet crepes - CHOCOLATE & fruit - are gluten free? The owner was very angry at the girl who was at the register .. She didn't know how to cancel my charge - so he very aggressively gave me cash back. Then later in the day when we walked by on our way back to the hotel ... If looks could kill I would be 10 feet under ground right now.   I think the sign in the window translates well "Sans Gluten Free"
