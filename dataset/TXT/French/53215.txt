QeFsIMcIFIJcOrpthYL8jg Looking for a local spot in Vieux Montreal, and the live jazz was just the ticket; or so we thought. The red wine that we splurged on was brought over from the fridge (seemed a bit odd) to the point of us having to ask for it to be decanted. I ended up holding it in my lap to warm it up a bit more. We'd decided on an onion soup and salad to start. Basic, to the point.  Lamb was their specialty, so we thought the chops looked good. They did, but they weren't particularly flavourful, nor warm. I wanted to really enjoy the meal, the ambiance, but it was a miss.
