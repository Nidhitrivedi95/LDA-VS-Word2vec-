SBnpT6JDbah-5l_52GM5sw If I was judging on ambiance alone, this place would easily get 5 stars.  It used to be our go-to place to bring out of towners for a nice night out to dinner (pre-Graze).  And truly, I have not had a bad dinner here (though I will always miss the skate wing!).  My issue with this place comes with the Brunch.  The best service we have received for brunch has been "acceptable".  What I don't understand is why their brunch chef cannot cook an egg.  I enjoy the yolk runny, and I guess the only way to get them this way is to specify barely over easy or sunny side up.  Poached was almost hard boiled, and even when I asked specifically if the baked eggs had runny yolks, I got overcooked eggs.  And for the prices here, I expect more.  I'll still go here for dinner, but there are a ton of other places in Madison I will be frequenting for Brunch.
