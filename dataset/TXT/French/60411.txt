SBnpT6JDbah-5l_52GM5sw Love the ambiance and location of this place. I passed it so many times when I'm headed to willie street or back to john Nolan. But I came here to celebrate a friend's birthday. It was great, she had a reservation and as it normally goes, I was the first one to show up. Since I don't fancy sitting at a table alone I went to the parking lot area that had a beautiful view of the lake. I was here during one of those random sunny days in winter and actually, to entertain myself went on the frozen lake! 
Once my friends showed up we were promptly seated, drinks were happily ordered and then food. So here goes: 
* Bloody Mary: AWESOME, comes with a beer back and is jam backed with pepper and loaded with condiments. One lasted for a good three quarters of the meal. It was the perfect mix and cure for a hangover
* Brioche French toast: for the price and serving size this was great! Sardine has a kind of ambiance of high class seafood but still casual, so I wasn't sure how big the portions were going to be. But with three very large slices of brioche bread that were cooked to moist on the inside crispy on the outside perfection and the sweet aprocote compote, with fruit and you CAN'T forget the lemon zest maple syrup. I was very satisfied with my meal. 

My other friends got a wide array of different entrees. Most of them were small for brunch and just okay. I will definitely be back here to try other things on the menu, but so far Sardine has my vote! 

Happy eating!
