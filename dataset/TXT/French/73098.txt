xNnZ5ksBY1gwwTV2Btb4Ag Manifique! Outstanding! The highlight of our trip to Montreal.

Customer Service was spot on. We could only get reservations for the bar.  We sat, happily and ordered beverages. We were approached twice and asked if the situation was ok. We were just fine, no problem. They were not happy. If there was a possibility we could be given a table it was ours. A bit of shuffling, half a beverage later, we were seated at the perfect two top in the front window.

Moving on to the meal.

THE BEST CHARCUTERIE EVER. Changes daily, but ours had some beef, pig loin, pork shoulder, a pate, a liver and a rabbit (which we only found out was rabbit later) all to be enjoyed with a delicious (raisin? apricot?) bread, mustard, and pickled things. $17 a steal.

BEST CREAM ALE EVER some microbrew outside of Montreal? KILLED our local Ontario Cream Ales. 

My main was a fish, and decent. Not the star of the show. The SO had a steamed pulled pork and duck bun that he loved, but he could not stop raving out the housemade Kimchi on the side. He is Asian, and lived in asia and eats an alarming amount of kimchi... and still said it is the best he ever had. Boutique Kimchi. Amazing.  

The decor is "Punched-tin-Slaughterhouse-chic" with an glass walled walk-in and open kitchen. Specials on chalk boards if you can read French. Attentive, friendly, laid back servers. The women all effortlessly beautiful. 

If this restaurant was near my home it would be over. Honestly over. I would not go anywhere else. Cannot wait to go back to Montreal just for dinner here.
