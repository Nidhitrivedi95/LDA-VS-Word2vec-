pmoIMK8zGWvKsVOPDBYfzg Husband and I celebrated his birthday over a long weekend in Vegas.  The restaurant was small but elegant and intimate with just 15 tables or less.  We had initially decided on the 5 course tasting but after speaking with our server, we were immediately sold on ordering from the a la carte.  For the first course, husband had pan-seared foie gras which paired perfectly with caramelized apple.  My escargots were juicy, flavorful and the sauce was great for dipping.  We both ordered the lobster thermidor for entree - 2 lbs of lobster cooked in a brandy cream sauce with asparagus and mushrooms.  The service was impeccable, food was well-prepared and I highly recommend it.
