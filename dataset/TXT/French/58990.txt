rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w I was there for my daughter's 21st birthday.  The atmosphere is great, elegant but not stuffy.  The view from the table was of the fountains, very spectacular at night.  The staff was pleasant.  The food was delicious.  The kind of meal that looks as good as it tastes.  The waiters were great.  There is nothing that can ruin an evening like bad service and the service here is amazing.  Go for a special occasion, it's worth it.
