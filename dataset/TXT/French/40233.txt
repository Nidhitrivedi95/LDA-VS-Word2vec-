KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA Went there for a wedding.  Great view and service.   The Chef nailed all our filets, perfect medium (there were 45 of us).  I wish my beet salad had a bit more goat cheese.  The live music was a nice touch.  I wish I lived closer.  Great wine, nice music, view awesome, and good food.
