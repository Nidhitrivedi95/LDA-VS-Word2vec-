uP3H5bcsiTXM0k0xQhRndg This place is nuts !!! The food the people all awesome ...the Mac and cheese is a creation unlike any other Mac and cheese you've had ... We had 2 specials for dinner one cod with cream sauce and one pork belly with sauces all around it ..
I can tell you this food was real real great .. The staff is so nice and polite from the wait staff to the cashier all very dedicated good workers.. The only reason I gave this place 4 stars was because of the comfort level .. We sat on a shaken table with folding chairs ...are you kidding me ? You guys have lines out the door making money hand over fist..GET SOME REAL CHAIRS !!!!!!!!!!!!!
My meal 2 specials , 1 app and a glass of wine cost 100 dollars with tip ...worth the money 100% ..
Go here but sit downstairs upstairs is very uncomfortable ...
