I stumbled upon this walking around with a friend in the area and boy was it worth it. Don't be fooled by the name - it is not just croissants, but boy are the croissants amazing. I don't think I've had better crossants outside of Montréal than this (maybe in Montréal i have...). But I digress: it is not only the croissants, it is everything else. They are extremely creative with using different kinds of pastries to make delicious sandwiches and brunch dishes. This is basically a great brunch spot, or a spot to have a relaxing coffee with friends over a tasty pastry. 

The locale itself is beautiful. It is an old bank and it stell has that (1920s?) bank teller desk where you can see the chef cooking behind it. Overall, very beautiful inside with a great patio ona quiet street yet just a few steps away from Parc Ave. They also have surprisingly excellent coffee. One of my favourites is the latte bowl... You know, for those extra hungover brunch dates.
