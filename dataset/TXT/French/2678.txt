0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g Really enjoyed our dinner here, every meal I had afterwards was hard-pressed not to disappoint. I had the degustation menu ($125): potato-leek soup and pheasant amouse bouche, lobster salad, scallop, foie gras, halibut, and mango sorbet. My wife had the prix fixe ($115): quail salad, foie gras, fallow deer. My in-laws had the degustation with the lamb. We all did the wine pairings ($65/$55).

My favorites were the quail, the pistachio foie gras, the scallop, and the deer. If I were to return, I would instead sacrifice the scallop and do the prix fixe, ordering what my wife did.

The wine pairings were great, definitely helped make the meal. Great service, and hard to complain about dining in a Picasso gallery with the Bellagio fountains outside.

One other delightful moment came right as we arrived. My wife sat down and thought, I need a purse hanger. Two seconds later, our waiter handed her a purse hanger. :)

All told, the bill with tip for the four of us was $1050. We didn't order any other drinks, but it was also fun to just peruse the enormous awesome wine list.
