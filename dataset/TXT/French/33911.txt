hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA if you're staying near the strip, baguette cafe can be a little bit of a drive...especially bc there's a lot of construction going on and you WILL get lost...even with a nav...give yourself about 45 minutes or so to get to the restaurant...that being said, you will not be disappointed...

the sandwich and soup were delicious...the only reason baguette cafe doesn't get a fifth star is bc the service can be a bit slow even when they are not that busy...it probably took at least 30 minutes for everything to come out..i would still go back for the food...and to hear olivier (the owner) talk in his french accent...
