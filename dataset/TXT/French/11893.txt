4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw family staying at the paris so we went for brunch on Christmas day.  I had the CB hash.  I'm a hash man and the server slightly oversold MAG's hash.  it was more like big chunks of corned beef and big chunks of potatoes neatly placed on a pretty plate.  I will say the crust on the corned beef and the quality of the meat were top notch.  the eggs were also cooked perfectly. the potato chunks lacked flavor and weren't cooked with the same love as the meat.  I also tried the lemon pancake.  it was darn good.  overall a good experience but not good enough to bring me down to the strip on my own free will.
