PlYrlj86zAYljZTRCBSZ3A Read a review that said they served the most authentic poutine in Toronto. Hopped on the 505 streetcar and headed for the address only to find that the article did not mention it was in a shipping container on the sidewalk. Nevertheless, the cook explained my options and I got the Montreal smoked meat version with extra gravy. It was pretty good. Too cold to sit outside so I found a table in the community center. Not the best atmosphere but I'm not complaining.
