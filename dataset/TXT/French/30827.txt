fyJAqmweGm8VXnpU4CWGNw I'm a fan of their bacon, egg + cheese croissant sandwich. They aren't stingy with the bacon and with every bite you get perfect amount of each ingredient. I've also had the beignets and although they were good, I would've liked them more with some chocolate sauce. That's not to say they don't have any, I just didn't ask  to find out. I would love come here for dinner one day since the times I've come so far have been on weekday mornings and I'm usually the only one there.
