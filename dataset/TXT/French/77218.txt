YUFxSG6idHePsxOmnSHtpQ Apprehensive breakfast visit due to the reviews of this location. Maybe it's a timing thing. I like to avoid crowds so I eat at off times. 9am in a weekday was perfect. Ample parking meant few patrons. I've been to Mimi's previously at other locations. Delicious choices of breakfasts if I'm not in the mood for my eggs, bacon, & hash browns (which I can have at least once a day for every day of the week). Today I had salmon Benedict. So happy with my choice. Loved the saltiness of the capers with the hollandaise sauce. Eggs done perfectly runny. English muffin held its own with all the oozy goodness. No onions for me. Crisp tiny whole & halved potatoes accompanied everything perfectly. Also order was the Santa Dr omelette. The 3 eggs contained all the tasty goodness inside rather well. The salsa had a good spot of unexpected heat. His came with a muffin which I almost was envious of while we waited for our meals. The strong dark coffee kept me distracted else I would have stolen a piece. Given the serious conversation in had a pleasant visit here. The waitress was attentive but overly intrusive. Atmosphere was tranquil till the lunch crowd meandered in filling the empty tables, about 1130ish. 

I am in between giving a 5 star rating. It was great yet not quite perfect. A 4.5 if it is possible.
