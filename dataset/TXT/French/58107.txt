rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A My recent meal at Bouchon was mostly excellent, with great food and  table service. My party started with cocktails, which were both subtly flavored and high quality, as expected. After a brief designated waiting period (the restaurant was half-empty), we were seated and attended to by our very good waiter. The menu here is traditional french, and we opted for a variety of dishes, ranging from simple trout amandine to luxurious steak diane (the special). We paired our food with a Cru Beaujolais recommended by our waiter (it was very good). The food was also quite good, although nothing blew me away. 

Overall, I was very satisfied with my meal, and especially so with the table service. However, I'm not sure the experience added up to the outlay, which came to a cool hundred per head. For that kind of cash, I expect the ultimate, and Bouchon fell just shy of my favorite fine dining experiences for some reason.
