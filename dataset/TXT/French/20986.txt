AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw YES the clock drops 3 boxes of FREE truffles.  It is not every 15 minutes exactly...more like every 20 minutes but it does drop truffles into the trays like the sign says.  A bicycle bell will ring when the boxes are released.

A nice place to people watch.  Loved our breakfast here.
