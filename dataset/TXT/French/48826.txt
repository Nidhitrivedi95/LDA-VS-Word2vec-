oJZNHz5UUVUgrZwVBVlpYw I'm definitely not the target group for the Petrossian Bar, yet I've grown to like this Bellagio bar.  My first experience was with a prolific porn director who treated my friends and I to a few round of drinks.  Fast forward a year and we found ourselves back at Petrossian.  My friends and I neglected to indulge in caviar or other white man activities and stuck to booze.

I ordered a Long Beach, while my friend ordered a Johnny Walker Black, and an imported brew.  The price on my Long Beach was a little steep ($15), yet my friend's Johnny Walker was a reasonable $12.  Petrossian is a classy lounge that's in the lobby of the Bellagio and is great for people watching late at night, especially as the bar is open all night long.  I suggest coming late at night (1am) as the clubbers make their way to The Bank or other neighboring clubs.
