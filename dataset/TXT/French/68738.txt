vna49NPM-7B11tcFPTgnsg One of my favorite spots. Perfect food, great wine, cute set-up. The dishes are not too big, so you could easily have two each. It's hard to get a table for more than 2 people unless you reserve in advance, but sitting at the bar is perfect for a one-on-one dinner! You have to do the homemade charcuteries (the cotechino is to DIE for, and so it their cumin mustard!!) and they will offer you a new take on a beet and goat cheese salad - finally!! If you're feeling fancy, the lobster tart is amazing and make sure you save some room for desert!!
