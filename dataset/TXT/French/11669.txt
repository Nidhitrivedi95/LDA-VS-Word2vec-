4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Long wait on a Sunday morning for brunch without a reservation if you want patio seats, but we opted for indoor seats and our wait was only 10min.

Decent coffee and fast service. Eggs Benedict was pretty good, but I was more wow-ed by the chicken apple and cheese crepe. The crepe was tasty and the chicken juicy and not overly dry. 

Definitely recommend making a reservation next time for patio seats!
