O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q They do not have it going on in terms of service.  I think it all starts with the manager who is not sure of himself then switches waiters on you (because a larger group came in) right in mid-service.  It was hard for me to get a drink (to get started) and when I wanted my favorite they said that they didn't carry it.  Later I find out they did.  Talked to the manager and his eyes didn't seem to care.  It was obvious where the problem lies.

Decor was outstanding (the Palazzo) but I should have taken a cue as to how few patrons were in the restaurant.
