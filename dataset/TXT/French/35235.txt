Ht-_i0UAq7YDBaqJwcQMdQ This  is one of the best restaurants I can remember visiting.  

The service is pretty slow but I think its intentional so I am not going to deduct for that.  

I started with a Negroni which is an easy way to figure out if a restaurant cares about the drinks it serves.  This one was perfectly made.  A good start.

Food wise, we had the smoked venison and chèvre appetizer and the pétoncles (scallops I think).  The venison was outstanding.  The scallops were a huge disappointment since I had read tons of reviews raving about them.  They are just seared with a citrus confit sauce and lots of restaurants have better scallops. But the venison is so good with the chèvre and its layered on crispy crackers with a sort of pesto on the sides.  An awesome combination of flavors and textures and a great tribute to game in a very classical French presentation.  Exactly what I want in a restaurant in Montreal.

For mains we had a fish and the bison.  The bison is unforgettable.  The fish was very good, again, with a great combination of textures and flavors (pistachios, artichoke, lemon).  But the bison with the leeks and mushrooms (chantrelles I think) was so good, I can't over emphasize what a great dish it is.  The place isn't cheap.  That meal I just described plus teas and 3 glasses of wine, (with two cocktails total) was about $250 at the end.  They do have an impressive wine list but again it is not cheap, bottles under $50 are few and far between.  The Chablis we had by the glass was $17.50 a glass.
