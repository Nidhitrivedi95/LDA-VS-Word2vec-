YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g Anyone that reads my reviews knows I routinely bitch about prices.  I'm Jewish, so it is allowed.  I would give this a 3.5 because its not quite a 4, but not really a 3 either.

Let's just say I had certain pricing expectations for this restaurant, and had a restaurant.com coupon.  My expectations were not only not met, but I ended up paying almost double what I thought I would pay.

Let's just say I walked out clutching my chest and short of breath because of the enormous amount of money I paid for this meal.  It overshadowed the incredible food, cocktails (loved my martini) and service I got here.  Go here, but remember that Hubert Keller is trying to swipe your house from you to get a meal at his restaurant.
