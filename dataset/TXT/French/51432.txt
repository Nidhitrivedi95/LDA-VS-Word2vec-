P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ I love visiting Guy Savoy! It's truly a sensory experience! The view and ambiance are blissful, the smells intoxicating, the textiles are luxurious, the sounds are Zen and the flavors, ash the glorious flavors, like an orchestra for my mouth! Anything and everything with truffles please! And Chase it with some sparkly!
