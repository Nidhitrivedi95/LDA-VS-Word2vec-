jSfnItqaOnEp2nenVF7fCg My wife and I have wanted to try this place for a long time but have not ventured that far west till yesterday.  We eat all over the world and can appreciate tastes that are not the normal chain food.  I had the sweet potato bisque and the brie and ham sandwich, my wife had quiche.  All fantastic!  As an idependent business owner, I applaud their decision to be who they want to be.  My family will be back
