Visiting a friend in Champaign for the weekend--this was an above average experience. (probably closer to a 4.5 than a 4)

To start we had an order of Truffle fries-very good.
I had Shrimp and Grits--it was fantastic!  Definitely 5 star--wouldn't change any part of it--though the portion was a bit huge.  My friend had the vegan dish on the menu and also really liked hers.
I am deducting one start for the desserts.  My friend had a fruit pie that was just a bit strange and it was too tart.  I believe that rhubarb wasn't countered by a sweet enough berry.  And it was a tad dry.
I had butterscotch pudding.  The pudding was good but it was topped with a ton of whipped cream.  The cream was clearly homemade so big thumbs up for quality but it tasted of bourbon.  I understand why, I am just not a fan of bourbon really.  My espresso martini that I paired with it was FANTASTIC though.  

Service was great--good recommendations on wine and very friendly.  We didn't feel like we "waited" for anything.  I like the atmosphere of the place.   They put a real effort into their dishes and everything has a homey feel to it.  Would definitely visit this restaurant again.
