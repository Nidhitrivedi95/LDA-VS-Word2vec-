kIW8IeTV3W1tS_q_WAU4wQ This was the first meal of our labor day Montreal getaway, and it was a great way to start the weekend!  I booked the reservation in the car on the way up, on a Friday night. I was a little nervous that the fact that they had so much availability was a bad sign, but we ended up having a great experience! 
I really enjoyed the decor--industrial chic, with painted brick walls, shiny metals, soft textures.. really fun and modern. The service was great, and we felt welcome right away. 
We ordered a Cru Beaujolais for our wine--something light we figured would go with a variety of things. It was nice, maybe a little overpriced (but you expect that in a nice restaurant). There was a really decent wine list, with quite a few options, had we been looking for something more specific. We didn't spend too much time looking at the cocktails menu, but we saw a few other patrons get drinks that looked great. 
We started with the beet salad appetizer, based on other reviews. Holy moly! It was really amazing- golden beets, served warm, with a delicious creamy sauce, bacon, goat cheese.. and the panko egg on top! It was really the highlight of the night for me. 
I ordered the salmon tartare, and my husband ordered the beef tartare as our main dishes. I like that there's an option to order the tartare dishes as appetizers, or to add a side to them and make them a main dish. We both chose to add salad and fries (you can add salad, or fries, or 50/50, which we did). I thought both were delicious! The salmon tartare had truffle oil which really gave it a unique flavor, and my husband liked it best. The beef tartare was the perfect amount of spicy, and it was my favorite of the two. The salad and fries were great as well. 
We had a lovely creme brulee (my favorite dessert) to end the night. I would definitely come back!
