gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA Wow! My husband brought me here on Saturday night to celebrate our wedding anniversary and we were definitely impressed.  

Upon arrival the host escorted us to a corner table for two with the the most BEAUTIFUL view of the strip we have seen to date and definitely set the romantic tone for the evening.  

Sylvano and his team took very well care of us throughout our dinner.  Speaking of Sylvano, he tactfully shared his knowledge of our meal, especially the wine pairings.  Even though I personally wasn't interested in knowing which small french town my Cabernet Sauvignon was cultivated...or the how and why...his genuine enthusiasm and unpretentious service  was very refreshing to come across at this type of a restaurant.

Everyone has different tastes in food and we felt that the food was very very good. Towards the end of our meal we were given a "congratulatory anniversary gift" from the restaurant...very nice touch!

Had the restaurant revolved (like Sky restaurant at the Space Needle in Seattle) and the food tasted like that of our favorite french restaurant (Fouquet's in Paris, France) it would of been a perfect evening....but maybe we're asking for a bit much. Lol

Can't wait to come back!

FYI: For an additional great strip view, after dinner, head on down to the 55th floor to Ghostbar. Entrance will be free as long as you identify yourself as a patron of Alize.
