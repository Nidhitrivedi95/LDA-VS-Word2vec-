33Tr0eRki1Yamzleu4GMdw Came for lunch today and it's a cute French casual setting with live plants and glass wine cellar. 

Greeted by the barista but was never offered a menu until another guy walked into our confused gaze on the chalk board consisting only drinks.

We ordered the Nord
smoked salmon sandwich along with red onions and capers. Salad was a bit over dress for me personally. Beautifully plated, sandwich was okay.

The man recommended their most popular quiche. I wish it was cheesier? The consistency of it was runny like an egg custard. I've never been to Paris, so I can't comment on if that's how it's supposed to be. But I've had quiche else where and it was definitely not like that. 

Lastly the charcuterie. $14.95 I got 4pcs of proscuitto, 4pcs of salami, 2 options of cheeses that tasted very basic, and few olives etc. to me, it was definitely overpriced for what it is. 

It was a cute place,  I liked the atmosphere, would probably be back when I see my dentist in the next plaza. Didn't try any desserts, hopefully the pastries are more impressive than the lunch menu.
