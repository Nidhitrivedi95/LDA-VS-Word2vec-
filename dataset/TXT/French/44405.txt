ME6D5nLlfG0xZCtICOYDuw We are here for restaurant week and it was great. The service was great and server was even willing to be honest when something was not her favorite on the menu. I got the pork belly appetizer was had great flavor. The short rib which I believe is not on the menu all the time was awesome. It was tender and was served over creamy grits. I normally do not eat grits and they were great. For dessert we tried the Creme brûlée and chocolate mousse. I thought the Creme brûlée was perfect, thick crunchy top and the custard was not extremely cold. Chocolate mousse was good but little heavy.

Overall we enjoyed and plan to go again.
