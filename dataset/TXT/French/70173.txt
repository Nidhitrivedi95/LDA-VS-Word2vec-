wwgRu0TAMX8rfRhsiI0ifQ I feel bad that I'm finally reviewing this place after going for so long.  It used to be my favorite dinner place up North.  Apparently they changed Chefs and the place seems to have some transition issues.  They are out of half the menu items and don't have the dishes as listed on the menu.  We used to always had excellent service and we went on a Weekday recently when only the bar is open.  It was sooo bad. The servers seemed almost lost.  No refills, they didn't tell us that half our dishes were missing stuff bc they were out.  We ordered dessert and it took so long we finally cancelled it.  No apology, just okay.  One thing I don't understand, they were out of mayo.  Seriously?  Mayo?  They serve hamburgers.  Actually they used to have my absolute favorite burger but apparently it's being taken off the menu so no mayo either?  The manager here needs to get with his/her people and find a way to work this out.  Our last 3 visits were filled with lots of problems culminating with the last really bad dinner. It might be time to move on I guess. I hope this isn't an example of what happens when Boyd gaming takes over a property. I'm a little worried now.
