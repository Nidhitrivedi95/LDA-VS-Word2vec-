aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw Most people know the Bouchon Bakery kiosk by the Venetian theater and Grand Luxe Cafe, but there is actually three satellites within the Venetian. This one is located under the clock tower and apparently there is a third in the sports book I haven't been to. 

So if you are outside, it is to the left of the gondolas right under the 2nd floor bridge from across the street so it's probably easiest to get to if you aren't staying here and walking the strip. This has outdoor seating, if you want to soak up the sun. From inside, go towards the Poker Room and follow it  to the right to a hallway going out and you'll see it. 

These will have the same treats as the original one, but this seems to have less traffic. I happen to pass by the theater one afterward and there was many things that were out that I did see at this one. If you're looking for a specific treat, call all three and see which one has it. I didn't get too much on this visit, I just wanted macarons. If you buy 5 of them, you get 1 free ($3.50 each) which fills their gift box perfectly if you are gifting these to someone. 

They were pretty friendly in here answering my questions about various things. Will be back, of course! Bouchon has been one of my favorite bakeries for years.
