YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g My husband and I were staying at the Mandalay resort and decided on this restaurant for dinner. I had an amazing cocktail madàme something. (I forgot the name) but that was fabulous. My husband had a beer that he expressed as okay but not worth 20$ we decided to do the tour which is a sampling of the chefs favorite dishes inspired from around the world. Overall absolutely delicious!! There was an item or two on there that was mediocre but I would have to say the soup was the absolute best! The service was exquisite and friendly. Anyone that passed was aware of low water, plates that needed clearing etc. The price was in the fine dining range but we were full when leaving so we felt portions were reasonable for two to try all the different courses offered for the price listed. The ambience was wonderful ! The dessert was ehhh but by then we were stuffed anyway do we weren't horribly upset on top of the fact that even with a few mediocre dishes the presentation was on point. I would return to this again if staying at the Mandalay for sure. I would be happy giving this a 4.5 star rating If possible!
