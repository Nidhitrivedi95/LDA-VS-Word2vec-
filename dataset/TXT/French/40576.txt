I have been coming to Marche Bacchus since before they even served dinner; when it was first and foremost a wine shop run by Gregoire.  When they expanded, I worried they would lose focus on bringing in fantastic Burgundies (which, btw, this place the BEST selection of in town).  Instead, they eased my fears and executed a simple menu that you could enjoy with the wines they sold.  

As the menu grew and ownership changed, the operation did nothing but improve.  Sure, I could nitpick about things I'd like to see or change on the menu, but that would be counter-productive, as they are always making tweaks.  Portions are huge, prices reasonable.  

My most recent visit was for lunch, and we had French Onion Soup (great flavor, though I would have loved more cheese), escargot (mmmm), lobster croissant (huge and filled with lots of lobster meat), poulet frites (fork tender and really juicy) and a ham & brie sandwich (really just ham and cheese, but good and tasty, nonetheless).  For desert, we had an enormous serving of lemon bar.  It was HUGE and more than enough for three people.

I absolutely LOVE the fact that you can buy any wine in the place and have it with your meal for $10 (and they'll also allow you to bring wines from your own collection, as well).  It makes it almost irresistible for me to suppress my inner wine geek.  

Wine with food?  This is my go-to spot.
