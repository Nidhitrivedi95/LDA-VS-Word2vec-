The restaurant boasts a lot of high end qualities but its faults to me out weigh what it trying to be achieved here. The food was good but not great.

The French Onion Soup was REALLY rich (which I understand isn't unheard of in French cuisine but I really found it hard to eat at the end of the day). I had the pan seared trout which made up for it.

I was having difficulty determining if the restaurant was trying to be a high end diner or a fancy, yet casual french restaurant setting.

I did however have some of the BEST Gin and Tonics in the city, so there is that :)

Service was way slow but it was a busy day when we went so I'll give them a bit of a break on that but it left a bad taste in my mouth.

The food is OK but it isn't where I thought it would be.
