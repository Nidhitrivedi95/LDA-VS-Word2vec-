DOmVF9YKOvTkqjcgUwtOgQ Very disappointed. Looks kinda like a french restaurant and the menu is better than the food. I know that Montreal is expensive but this doesn't stand up to to price paid. I had the Plate D'hote which was blue marlin described as grilled with a cool center. It was overcooked and pretty tasteless. My wife had a grilled salmon which was just OK. With one glass of wine and no dessert, it was a hundred dollar bill. We didn't stick around for dessert. Service was OK; slow but after all it is a french restaurant. Won't be back.
