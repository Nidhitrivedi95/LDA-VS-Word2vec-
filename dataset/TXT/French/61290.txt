SJo_IjvzdRtCvZVN0cbrRQ I went here for the first time last weekend, and enjoyed one of the best brunches I've had since moving to Cleveland. 

The croissant I had with my breakfast sandwich was honestly the most beautiful, flaky on the outside moist on the inside thing ever.  biting into it, feeling the initial crunch of the crust, then the buttery, warm inside. Oh my God. 

There was a lot of attention to detail with the food - for example the fruit was free of filler melons (that's the worst). And instead was comprised of blackberries, pineapple, and strawberries. The whole meal was delicious. 

Why not 5 stars?  At this point everyone should know that NE Ohio is very cold half of the year.  Not a big deal, but I was seated right next to the door, which isn't well protected from the elements like most restaurants here.  I had to wear a coat because it was freezing, and a little bit of snow reached my table.  Not a big deal, but a tiny buzz kill.
