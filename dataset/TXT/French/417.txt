-ldPcsGH5joUVtwClIPNbQ Super cute French Restaurant in downtown St-Sauvuer called La Boheme.

  My friend girl and I decided on this place to have a nice dinner.
  The decor is older but charming and warm.

  They have Chalkboard Specials.  Veal, Beef Tartar, Rabbit , Duck, Frogs Legs are some of the items the menu lists.

  There are Vegetarian options here.  Great wine prices.
We ordered the Calamari it was really good.

    We both chose a fish dish. It was delicious and cooked perfectly moist.
With the Entree you have a choice of Fries or Mashed Potatoes, or veggies.
 The fries were some of the best, they know the secret to good fries here.

The waitress was great and paid attention to us even though it was a slow night and would slack off.

   The dishes (apps under 10$, entrees under 20$) and the wine were well priced, its no wonder this place has been around a long time.. 30 Years.

  A delicious  Restaurant to try out when in the area.
