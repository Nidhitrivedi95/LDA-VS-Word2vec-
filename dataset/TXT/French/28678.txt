eJ9L40jm5VOXCIq7xs9kQw This was the best French restaurant I've ever been to. The service is amazing and the ambience was so relaxing and inviting. 

We had the taste menu. The froi gras was so delicious I wanted to lick to plate. Had the scallops and shrimp which was to die for and the rack of lamb so moist and tender. 

Definitely recommend this restaurant if your looking for a French inspired meal. Must try.
