B_0VW7Pw26YiQyDRuutIGQ Went to dinner with my Father last night. We both had the beef bourguignon that was a very bland version of the one I was used to. For appetizers I had the French onion soup and he had the beef tartar. Fast forward to 3 am I am woken up by my father throwing up violently. This went on for hours. I however did not get sick. The waitress was very friendly and helpful however. With all of the great food choices near by I would take your money else where.
