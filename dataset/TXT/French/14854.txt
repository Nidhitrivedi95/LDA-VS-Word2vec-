5fquJHY2hMX9tPRD5s0t5g Went to Roosters downtown with friends for drinks. The waiter was rude and condescending. When I went to pay for the drinks they charged me an extra dollar than what the menu said for each drink. The  atmosphere however is very laid back and chill. Overall I would say proceed with caution when visiting this particular location.
