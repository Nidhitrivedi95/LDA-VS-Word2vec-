yGg7O0ATbMzoxrLvByzp2g In Montreal there is no cheesecake factory. We have Elixor and to be honest I don't think it is as good as cheesecake factory. The location isn't bad and it is a very big place so finding a table won't be a problem. The service is horrible though. The waiters are not a problem however since this place is so huge the food takes forever to arrive. In terms of how it tastes it's nothing special. Overall if you are visiting the city and you need a place to eat, I would check this place out.
