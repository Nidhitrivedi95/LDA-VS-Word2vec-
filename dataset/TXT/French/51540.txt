pKiSzUlBBRNEdTML24piXA My wife surprised me with a birthday dinner at the Centurion.  We got off to a rocky start when they couldn't find our reservation and had no recollection of the emails exchanged with my wife.  After I produced a copy of one of the emails there was a long pause while they checked with the kitchen to see if we could be accommodated with the 7 course tasting menu we had requested.  We were advised there would be a wait before the tasting menu service would begin as several customers would be doing the tasting at the same time.  We were seated and given a complimentary glass of wine for our trouble.  The tasting was wonderful with varied small plates matched to wines from several regions.  We choose to sit next to the prep kitchen so we could watch the food preparation and talk with the chefs.  The courses were served at a nice pace and each wine served In a fresh glass.  The food was excellent with very creative flavor combinations that were well executed and visually appealing.  Our server was new, attentive and got answers to our many questions.  The chefs  were focused but friendly.  The small kitchen definitely impacts what they can accomplish but they do a great job of working around the kitchen limitations .  There are a number of menu items we would like to try like the stuffed mushrooms, the lamb and wood fired pizza. We got to see most of the menu items coming out of the kitchen.  They all looked good and smelled wonderful.  It's a great little place with a surprising array of food and wine.  We plan to make it a regular  dinning stop.
