We had reservations for 7 girls who were here to have a nice dinner as a bride to be and her bridesmaids kicked off an amazing weekend. We did it right with Boulud! 

The atmosphere inside seemed a bit dark but classy. We were seated outside by the waterfall which was amazing. They make great cocktails here from a watermelon mojito, flirtini and great classic martinis with a great presentation. 

Many items were ordered and a few highlights were:

The lobster salad- A bit too busy on the plate but great citrus flavor and lots of elements to keep you wanting more. 

John Dory- a white fish with a delicious buckwheat cake

Steak- not sure which one she got but she said it was very good. 

2 orders of pasta and clams, delicious. 

Moule Frite- Great sauce! Finally a place that makes it well. The only complaint was that the french fries were terrible. Soggy and tasted like they were from a Freezer bag. This definately needs to be redone. Fresh potatos, cut them thinner and crispy please. 

2 orders of Jadori Chicken- Very moist and tasty. 

It really helped that a table sent us over a $500 bottle of Rose Champagne which was fantastic. 

We also tried the Chocolate cake, souffle, mint and rasberry tart. All were very good. 

Our table enjoyed the little shows they had going on throughout the night. We loved the flowers. Some were a bit weird but its Vegas so its ok. 

The price of our meal was about $80 per person including tip. 

I would definately recommend Boulud for groups as well as couples.
