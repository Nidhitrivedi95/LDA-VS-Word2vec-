0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g A view of the water works at the Bellagio hotel alone is reason enough to dine here. However, the dining experience is first rate. As a wine addict I was impressed by the depth and diversity of Picasso's wine list. The sommeliers are knowledgeable ( including a Master Sommelier) and they make good recommendations. I had the tasting menu: quail salad, red shrimp with shashito pepper juice, and lamb chops. The cooking was superb and the presentation of dishes was very creative. The menu changes daily.
