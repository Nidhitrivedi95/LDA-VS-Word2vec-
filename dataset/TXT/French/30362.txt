FRuuIDOd21pTJHvEGIt1Gg Walked in late on a Sunday night about a half an hour before they were closing and they seated us immediately and were not put off by the time at all which was really nice!  My bf and I both ordered beers that came out almost quicker than I thought was possible for our adorable waitress to go get.   My bf ordered the foie gras appetizer which was amazing and I had the french onion soup which was really good but not the best ever.  We split the duck confit as our entre.  It was AMAZING, perfectly cooked and extremely delicious.  I'd go back just for this dish.  We stayed past closing and they were still seating.  It was really nice to see that they didn't turn anyone away.  Loved this place.  Definitely recommend.
