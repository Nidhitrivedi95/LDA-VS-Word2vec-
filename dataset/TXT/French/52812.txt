QD0gnPAdy7w2vZZG9I41Sw The concept of dining in complete darkness is really interesting and the food was well made. It is definitely a good and unique experience. Our server was also very competent and friendly, which made our trip all the better. Points we disliked, however, were mostly surrounding how the restaurant is kept. The front steps need fixing for discoloration, the menus should probably be re-laminated to look newer and I hit a splinter in the wall I was seated next to in the dark. It was also very noisy inside the restaurant, which made it very hard to have any conversations inside. I think that's the case maybe due to floor design. For the price you pay, I'd expect a little better from the owners when it comes to presentation and safety. My chair was wobbly as well, which wasn't a great first impression. Otherwise, the service was great and the food was good. I'd recommend this place to my friends.
