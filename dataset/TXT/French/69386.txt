WDzU-miZGQMADcWp-BZEoA Finally there is real Japanese in Toronto.  Okay I am not a big fan of Udon but the Black Cod was simply melt in your mouth amazing.  The quality of the sashimi was absolutely superior and the shrimp and chicken Tempura was the best I have ever had.  The portions are definitely more Japanese than American but I absolutely I love it!
