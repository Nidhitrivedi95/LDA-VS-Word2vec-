oJZNHz5UUVUgrZwVBVlpYw As a finale to my last three day stay in Las Vegas we finally came here.  We just wanted drinks and to listen to the piano and watch the people go by so this review is totally a reflection from my experience sitting in the front by the railing at the piano bar.  It was fantastic and the pianist took requests.  While we conspicuously consumed our Czar caviar, Veuve Cliquot, and Russian Grain Vodka we were serenaded with the sounds of the themes from Love is a Many Spledored Thing and The Valley of the Dolls.  I wanted him to play Won't you come home Bill Bally and Spinning Wheel but he just laughed and covered his mouth and said he couldn't play that here.  He was fantastic and so was the lulling lobby traffic.  Truly a romantic and luxurious place to wind up your trip or any evening.  If you want to have more than a beer though bring a couple hundred dollars with you.  :)
