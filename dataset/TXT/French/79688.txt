zqNgwQjj0_XAll-neGikIw This is the first and last visit I will make to this restaurant! Rarely, do I post poor ratings but I feel I must. I ordered Eggs Benedict and an ice tea with lemon. One orders and pays prior to being served. The waitress forgot my lemon and I tried to remind her but she must not have heard me. I asked the other waitress who came to clear the table next to me and she seemed a bit sarcastic with her response. Anyway, I finally got my food and the presentation was very nice. The salad was good and I ate it first then moved onto my eggs. They were tasty and then I took a bite full of what tasted like vinegar. I washed it down with the iced tea and thought it was odd but the portion until that point was good. My next bite resulted in a awful bitter taste that compelled me to spit out my food. I went to the front and told the waitress what happened and said I needed something to cut the awful bitterness. She apologized and I paid for a desert that barely was consumable. It was a lime tart I think as I thought the taste might break the horrible bitterness in my mouth. After I reported the eggs. The response was,"sorry about that" , but no concern for my well being. I left with no tip and feeling sick! This is not the appropriate way to handle the situation. I have no idea what was in my food but it was not meant to be I'm sure. Hours later and I have an upset stomach and a bad taste in my mouth for this restaurant. Here I thought I found a little gem in my neighborhood, but what I left with was the thought that I will never return and tell others to beware.
