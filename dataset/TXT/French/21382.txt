B56AYe5GNuavMDtwFsXqzA I am far from a french food expert but I had a great experience here. The staff are over the top friendly and accommodating. I love the cozy atmosphere inside and on the patio. They have an interesting cocktail menu and a choice selection of french wine and champagne to kick off your evening. We started with the escargot which was so decadent. I had the Lamb Chops which were the best I've ever had. The Scallops my friend ordered were perfectly prepared and succulent. I highly recommend you try Petite Maison very soon it is one of the best values in Scottsdale (dinner for two minus drinks was under $80).
