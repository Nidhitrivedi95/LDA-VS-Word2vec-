4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Mon Ami Gabi brunch menu reminds me of SF's Grand Cafe menu. The quiches and French toast plates are comparable to a 3-star menu.

The awesome view of the Bellagio water show from the outdoor patio kicks up a star. Of course the patio is great for people watching and sun-soaking.

The fifth star is from the "bom digi bom di deng di deng digigi uu uuu" Bloody Mary and the full veggie bar with delicious cured carrot sticks, crispy celery sticks, several different olives, a dozen of hot sauces, and best of all, beef jerky to stash in your Bloody Mary.
