hvjgF-vnPw2jyL5DBuB0qg My boyfriend and I ate here for our 2 year anniversary. We had called about a month in advance to reserve, and were pleasantly surprised to be able to make one easily (although we did go on a Tuesday which probably helped). The location, ambiance, lighting and decor of the place was just so charming! We tried the avocado, tomato and fried cheddar salad and the lobster poutine to start. LOVED the salad, very rich. The poutine was great too but quite expensive ($21). I ordered the black truffle and goat cheese risotto which was bursting with flavour, although was a little too al dente for my liking. My boyfriend ordered the short ribs which he raved about! It is an expensive restaurant, but you are definitely paying for the quality (and the portions are generous). We finished off with a deep fried Mars bar served with vanilla ice cream which was so simple but delicious. We tried it because we had heard so many great reviews about it, but otherwise, there aren't any fancy/ amazing desserts. Very simple items, such as a cookie or a crumble. The dessert menu probably the only thing they could improve on (hey Chuck, I'm a pastry arts student... ;) ). Overall, a great restaurant and we would go back if we weren't poor students!
