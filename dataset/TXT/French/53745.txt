The value for the quality of ingredients, atmosphere and service was impressive.

There is a prix fixe 3-course menu for $48 if you dine PRIOR to 7pm.  

We opted for ala carte.

Interior: made me feel like I was dining at a French chateau & tables were spaced nicely.  Bathrooms are available for use INSIDE the restaurant.  

Appetizers/Salads:
Lobster salad-Everything was shelled, and there were cubes of various types of watermelon incorporated.  Light, refreshing and completely summery.  
Caesar salad-standard, large portion, no FRESH pepper cracked tableside.
Tuna Tartare-OK, but I was not a fan, no toasted bread, and capers, what is this Italian?!?

Entrees:
Steak Frites-nicely done, juicy and cooked perfectly rare.
Trio of Kurobota pork-I like trios of anything, the more ways the better.  All styles were finger licking, from the chop, to the sausage and finally the beautiful LOIN.  The incorporation of stuffing was inventive.  

Desserts:
White chocolate & berry mousse-usually not greatly swayed by mousse, but this one was surprisingly light.
Chocolate cake-oozing, gushing chocolate.  

Compliments of the chef:
Two mini blueberry muffins.  Yum.

Everything was perfectly executed and we were transported to another place for 2 hours of our life, a must for any Vegas experience.
