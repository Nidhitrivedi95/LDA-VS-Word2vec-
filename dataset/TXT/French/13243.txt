4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Really great breakfast item selection and I love sitting on the patio watching the Bellagio fountains.  I've also enjoyed a nice steak dinner here, but found the absolute value proposition to be a little questionable. I'm not a big fan of Paris, but I have no problem coming this way to a great breakfast occasionally.  I recommend the Benedict.
