tCSlpwJQ4CZsUEMZeH2SFg Despite my terrible experience, I really did appreciate the response I received from the owner of the restaurant, Mr. Smith. He approached me with class and professionalism.

I do feel that it was my responsibility to report that incident to the proper authorities who conducted a thorough inspection of the restaurant. It is clear to me that this was an isolated incident that will probably never happen again. The roach or moth (whatever it was) did create quite a situation but I am ready to move on.

I wish Mr. Smith, his staff and his establishment all the best.
