cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg Visited during last week of October with boyfriend and we'd made reservations almost 10 days before. Best we got on reservations was at their opening time on a Saturday, which was ok for us. It was his second time to the restaurant.

Up front you should know, as other reviewers have written, that the noise level is very high so don't count on Au Pied de Cochon for that quiet romantic candle lit dinner, perhaps mid week is a lot different. 

We were seated at window - was a little chilly in this location so perhaps you could ascertain your seating when you make the reservation.

Anyway the good was excellent. I'm probably not going to be as generous as many other reviewers because there are simply too many great restaurants in Montreal that are on the same, or even that bit higher level in my estimation in terms of taste of food, presentation, price, ambiance and well overall friendliness of staff. 

It was my very first try of Foie Gras - nice but sinfully bad for you. The Duck in a Can, again was delicious, however I think the presentation was the selling point for me as I'd seen it on Anthony Bourdain show. The wine list...good but on a personal note was pricey for me.

About the floor - beware - twice I slipped coming and going to the bathroom. Not pleasant when you grab another a patron in a jam packed restaurant to hold you up. It was the same for many people. Note to management - take care of your grease problem on the floor. 

Is it worth a visit - yes if you want to say you've worn the t.shirt.
