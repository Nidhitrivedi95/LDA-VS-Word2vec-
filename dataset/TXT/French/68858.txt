VSPft3RUXDE8HnX6Anvbvg While the waterfront atmosphere is nice and the service is very attentive, this restaurant is very overpriced and the menu is tiny. I went here because of a great review in my travel guide. If this restaurant had posted its menu on its website, I would not have gone. The food here is fine, but in a city with no shortage of great restaurants, why limit yourself to a tiny menu and subject yourself to high prices?
