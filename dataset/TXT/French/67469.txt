UxWH8zRYIBgs6Q2oykvRdw I've been to this restaurant twice -so I will do a summary review of the lunch and dinner experiences.

Here's a couple things you need to know about Cluny:
-it is a bit pricey, but the full experience is worth it for a special occasion
-ambiance/decor are beautiful with attentive service to match
-you can dress up without feeling out of place, but easily can get away with jeans

On the food front:
-fresh assorted bread basket for the table (don't fill up before your food comes out)
-try their hot sauce, you might want to drink it straight
-if they have Belon oysters available, get them. They are meaty and flavourful an very creamy
-salted cod donuts, great to share, and not super fishy
-steak frites were very well seasoned, and the shoe string fries go well with their hot sauce
-meatball and gnocchi dish were plentiful, though I enjoyed the protein far more than the gnocchi (a bit over cooked)


If you haven't been, and have a birthday, anniversary, girls night, etc, coming up - definitely check it out. It is one of the few places in the Distillery were you can get a great meal for the premium price you're paying.
