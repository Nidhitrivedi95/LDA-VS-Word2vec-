cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg Hands down one of the best meals of my life...Went there a month ago visiting Montreal for the first time after a friend recommended it. Was super lucky to get a reservation at 9pm calling in the morning. ya the place is packed and crammed but that means it a great restaurant. our waiter was awesome and totally hosted us for great recommendations and was funny as hell. Everything we had was awesome, duck in a can was unreal and quite the experience. Poutine was insanely good too. We had absolutely no room for desert but we ordered the maple crème brulee and that was incredible...we ate so much incredible food that night, I felt like I was in a food coma after..still at the gym working it off now but it was worth it. will be back!
