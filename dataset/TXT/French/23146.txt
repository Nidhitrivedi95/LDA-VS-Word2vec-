Came in this morning at 10 with a friend since we were close by. The shop was empty save us and one other customer at the time (by the time we left, 2 more had come). I had the mademoiselle (sautéed vegetables + cheese) eggs benny. A very good deal, huge portions, but OK food. The hollandaise sauce was not the best that I've had-- it's a little runnier and lighter than most and I like mine creamy. Eggs were good. Potatoes were deliciously seasoned. Came with complimentary tea/coffee! The waitress was also very friendly.
