Funny anecdote: Was at a friend's dinner party.  We told the waiter it's his birthday (it was), so he asked my friend if he wanted profiteroles.  He said okay (we brought a bottle of red wine for each person, so he was kind of tipsy).  15 minutes later the waiter shows up with profiteroles, and good time was had by all.  Until my friend looked at the bill, and discovered that he just paid for his own b-day dessert!  HAHA
