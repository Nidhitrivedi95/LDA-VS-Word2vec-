rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Bouchon may have ruined me for all other brunches. It's just too good! We started with half a dozen oysters on the half shell, followed by the roasted chicken with bacon/chive waffles, and the white sausage with scrambled eggs and croissant, washed down with a spicy bloody mary.

Oh-hohhh boy. Absolute perfection. Every part of it. Every single bite. Every little sip.

A perfect brunch.
