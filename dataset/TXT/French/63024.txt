SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA Came here last night for my bday dinner. Omg. Spectacular. I have not had this great of a time and food since the 1st time at Chinato's. SO SO SO yummy. Mouth-exploding goodness. 

Service was excellent, although again, tables are small and can barely fit the food. Aside from that, the hostess, waiter, and other random waiters came by to wish me happy birthday. 

Tip: bring your own wine! No corkage fees either. 

Restaurant has their own parking lot, takes cash only. $3 for weekend nights. 

Food:
Appetizer: 
3 cheese plate - the cheese person was very very knowledgeable about the cheese, and recommended 1 soft, 1 medium-soft, and 1 sharp/hard cheese. Delicious. He also gave us two scoops of fig preserve, which was so scrumptious. Even my bf who doesn't like figs enjoyed this. This is very very filling.

Mushroom french toast - I love the balsamic vinegar taste that adds some kick to the mushroom and soft french toast. Exploding with flavor.

Entrees:
Bf ordered the duck confit as he did the other two times we went to L'albatros. The duck was very tender, and the portion was huge, bigger than I remembered.

I ordered the pork two ways. A little over salty, but still very very enjoyable. Both the pork shank and the pork belly melt in your mouth. The pickled onions on the side complimented the fattiness of the pork, and also refreshes your palate. The best part was the fried cauliflower. I would come back just for the cauliflower. You would never imagine that cauliflower would be so flavorful.

Dessert/Drinks:
Effen berry cocktail - minty with chunks of strawberries. 
Creme caramel - came with a candle! Tastes like a mix between flan and creme bruele. Not too sweet, and the caramel sauce compliments the cream on top very well.

TLDR, LOVE this place. May be my newest happy spot in Cleveland.
