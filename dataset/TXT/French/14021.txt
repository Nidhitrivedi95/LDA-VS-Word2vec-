58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw Le Cartet is a great spot for a weekend brunch in Old Montreal. The ambiance is so cheerful and the staff is very friendly. Be sure to order something from the brunch menu. It's a bit more expensive than your typical breakfast place, but the brunch menu includes free coffee and orange juice refills. You also get a little amuse-bouche before your meal. Plus the portion of the food is enormous!
