HojKatUfX4UHWaPqtl63NQ Ok let's start at the beginning.  The elevator ride to Rivea and Skyfall was pure agony.  If you are claustrophobic I might caution you a bit.  It's extremely hot and hard to breath.  So if breathing is a big deal to you I might reconsider.  Hot air pouring out of the vents made me almost go full panic mode.  

So once off the elevator we decided to have drinks and appetizers at Skyfall.  However the appetizers we ordered never came which lead me to believe their staff isn't well put together and they had no desire in making more
Money.  

On to dinner at Rivea!  First off very beautiful and lovely decor.  They seated us on the patio outside.  Again extremely warm outside and our party wore suit jackets and ties.  No fans or mist of any kind so the air was just dead.  Even ceiling fans would be helpful. I'm sure in the winter months it would be nice but summer even into September it's just too hot out there.  

Our waiter was very very helpful and had only good things to say about him.  However way too slow!  The food was very good!  The breads delicious.  So it was a nice experience with the music and table settings. The dishes I thought were beautiful as well.  Great wine selection!  Let's get back to the music because that is all part of the experience. I loved the blend of music they played, definitely not typical radio music which was so refreshing.
