cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg Perhaps my taste buds and Asian background is not geared for the ultra rich dishes this fine restaurant has to offer. We found the dish mostly doused with a large dose of froi grois which in small measures adds flavor but in large amounts just too rich too fat for my liking. I cannot imagine French people eating such rich food everyday. 

Service food presentation and even price were all great. Just not to our preference.
