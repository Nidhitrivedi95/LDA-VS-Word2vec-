xaqW4NkmUCGRRjmLxiFJ6Q I took my mum hear for Mother's Day. We ordered  the vegetarian option (forgot the name but it had beans) and it was delicious. The vegetables are fresh and the portion is so generous. We were stuffed but couldn't help but order a desert crepe which was amazing as well. The desert crepe had walnuts - wow! We would've ordered a meat option but we don't like cold cut meat. Perhaps in the future if they have grilled chicken it would be nice. Place is clean and staff is so nice. If you're there on a hot day you can sit outside on the benches.
