ynYEgNimJOyb8dvyr9x0sA This is our first visit to Le Chalet. We sat near the kitchen to watch the action. We began with a traditional Flammenkuchen (10.50). This is described as oven toasted tart with sour cream, bacon, seared onions and Swiss cheese. It was delicious. I then had the "La Potence" (25), considered the house specialty. My wife had the Mediterranne (13.85), a crepe topped with seared scallops and leeks in a tasty saffron sauce. My daughter had the Savoyarde (10.25), a crepe with sauteed potatoes and onions and Raclette cheese. We finished everything off with the Crepe Tatin (7.80), The dessert was insanely delicious. Chef Ferre makes this slightly salty caramel sauce which was amazing.
The wine list is modest in price and well represented. 
Go there, you won't be disappointed.
