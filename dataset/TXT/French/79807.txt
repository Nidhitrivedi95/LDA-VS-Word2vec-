We ordered the halibut ceviche which was A party for my taste buds.  I almost ordered two but then realized would like to try something else on their menu.  My wife ordered the swordfish and I ordered the chicken.  The food was very savory.  I really enjoyed dining experience at this restaurant.  By far one of the best restaurants in Scottsdale Arizona we ate at it this weekend.
