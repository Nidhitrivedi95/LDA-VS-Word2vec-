dd3GZs6zW2t7BM0cbxAzvg Drop by La Palette for brunch on a Sunny Sunday afternoon. If you love and enjoy the warm sunshine, make sure you sit at the front of the restaurant... I have to wear my sunglasses while enjoying my brunch!

Eggs Benedict  with hollondaise on ricotta herb biscuits with Wild boar belly shank crepinette ($14) was A-OK. The eggs were cooked perfectly and the wild boar belly was tender..... The only thing I can complain was my salad was drowned in the really sour dressing...

Services was hit and miss...I wouldn't say I was neglected, but not overly attentive...

I might come back for the Prix Fixe menu and give La Palette another try!
