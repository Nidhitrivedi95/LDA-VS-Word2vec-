HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw Beautiful restaurant with a great view. I was not expecting the amount of food we got so that is an immediate plus. Usually I leave a strip restaurant with an empty wallet and my tummy grumbling like gremlin after midnight, but not in this case. I must have had about 4 cocktails and a couple of other drinks which were OK but didn't blow my mind. There was one drink that was mostly crushed ice. I don't remember the name but I'll remember to stay away from it next time. 

For starters we had the crab cakes, escargot, and roasted bone marrow, and a leek soup. The stars there were the leek soup and the roasted bone marrow. On a later trip to the Wicked Spoon buffet I found a comparable roasted bone marrow. They were all pretty good. 

I ordered the scallop special. The scallops were perfectly clean and cooked with a pistachio crust. the pistachio crust gave an extra layer of texture and flavor to the scallops, I would definitely have that again. Overall a pretty good experience. I am still surprised that I walked out of there full.
