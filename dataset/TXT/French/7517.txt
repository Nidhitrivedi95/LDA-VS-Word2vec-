4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Went to Mon Ami this weekend with a group of 6 girls. We waited over 45 minutes to sit in the Pavillion area when we had reservations at 9pm.
They sat us at a VERY small round table in the middle of the walkway, which was uncomfrotable. The patio door was open which isnt so bad but they also had the AC on blast. Helloo its almost 10pm and it was 60 degrees outside!
Our waiter. Such a miss. I asked if Marlin was working that night and he wasnt ;( Our waiter was TERRIBLE. 
He was unattentive, flat out ignored us, took forever, wasnt professional and really didnt have a good persoanlity. Smile a little!
The worst were the slow bustboys. They left us with our dirty plates for too long, reached across the table to serve food and lifted plates ABOVE my head to clear things away. Derfinately not ok in our book. 
The food was generally very good as always. Their special of fish in Saffron sauce was NOT good and we sent it back. Luckily that was refunded on the bill. 
Steaks, frite, and desserts (Creme Brulee and Flourless Chocolate Cake were VERY good). 

I will definately come again because its worth it. This night was just a miss because of the waiter. Next time, Im calling ahead for Marlins shift.
