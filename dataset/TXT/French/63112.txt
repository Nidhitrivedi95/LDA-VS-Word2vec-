SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA One of my very favorite Cleveland restaurants! Best steak I've had in the city, and possibly best steak ever. The hanger steak is always perfectly seared and flavorful, but I think it might be their béarnaise sauce that makes it. I almost always order it. 

Another favorite is the duck confit. It is usually fantastic. One time I ordered it and it was seriously dry; that was a disappointment but I guess everyone has an off day. 

The salads and appetizers are great- try the mushroom French toast!! 

They have a great wine selection and the servers are always very knowledgeable. 

Really love their outdoor patio. Perfect ambiance. Indoors is very nice too. Great restaurant. One of Cleveland's best.
