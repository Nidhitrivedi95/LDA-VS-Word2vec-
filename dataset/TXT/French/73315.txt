xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g Celebrated a bachelorette/bachelor party dinner here with a group of 12. We didn't have to wait long to get seated.  The space between the seats were kind of tight-it is like that all around.  Service was great--fast and efficient. We had wine with dinner and the sommerlier was nice. Our wine glasses were never empty--we had a total of 4 bottles.  They had a good selection of bread, server comes around to ask which one you want. Tried the foie gras---delicious.  They are known for their chocolate souffle but I am not a dessert person-didn't get it but others did and said they were good...you be the judge.  Really enjoyed it here and would come again.  The views were good from our table which was in the middle--suggest getting a table along the windows.  We had a good view of the Eiffel Tower.  My dish was yummy-makes me want to come back to try other dishes.  We had a great time here and would come back.
