I wanted something close by and picked this because other places were busy, big mistake by me. 
The price of the food is competitive with the area so it has that going for them. The quality of the food and service, however, leaves much to be desired. I ordered the rack of lamb, medium rare. When the food came is was closer to medium well. I politely informed the server and he offered to redo the dish. The dish came back the same, medium well and when I informed the server he told me that sometimes the light will affect the colour of the meat to make it look more cooked than it actually is. Let me say that I've eaten my fare share of lamb and steak, I know what medium rare is and what I got was not. The server implied that it was cooked correctly and he was really doing me a big favour. One of the worst restaurants in Toronto. 

Stay away!
