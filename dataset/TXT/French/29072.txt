EPb3FWs3mxQLUjGeMNP0SQ The restaurant had a great vibe and the decor was stunning from the outside and in. 

Non pretentious place, mixed dinner crowd as well which was nice to see. We were a table of 4, did two rounds of drinks with appetizers and entrees. 

What I had:
1. Grilled octopus $15
2. Fazzoletti pasta $22 
3. Dessert donuts (on the house) 

I found the pasta a bit hard and it stuck to each other...besides that the octopus was very good and dessert was awesome. 

Great for a night of cocktails and lounge.
