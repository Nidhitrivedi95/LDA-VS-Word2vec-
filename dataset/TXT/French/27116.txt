dd3GZs6zW2t7BM0cbxAzvg CLEARLY as you can tell... I'M a Foodie. I swear if i wasn't a veggie i would be a good 200 lbs lol but luckily for my metabolism i am not. 

This place has been around for years and we all know why. 

The man that runs this ship knows what he is doing and loves what he is doing.

French cuisine can definitely be an acquired taste. For those that are picky with their pallets i say ride on the wild side of your taste buds and give this place a try. 

Everything is fresh and homemade which doesn't get any better than that. 

With knowledgable and attentive staff this place make for a great group get together or a romantic evening.
