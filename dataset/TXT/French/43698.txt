m4PW-GMc8JOU5nmMYncu-Q This joint has all the ingredients, all the trimming, all the possibility to be a top notch spot for imbibing however, like a good cocktail the execution and careful measurement are absolute requirements to ensure precise flavor control and a delicious final result. 

Le Lab has an amazing selection of bitters, home made and bought, infusions and a decent selection of booze. I found myself wondering why they needed to serve Jack Daniels when behind those bottles were far more interesting bourbons? Then it dawned on me, this place is trying to be everything to everyone instead of drawing a line in the sand and standing by only top notch ingredients. 

I had the cocktail a la Louisiana, an old school drink that I'm very familiar with. Too sweet and too heavy handed on the absinthe, and don't get me wrong, I like my absinthe, but I like my cocktail to have balance. My wife had a tall glass full of mint leaves and some overly sweet swill. Our compatriots Talisker came with cold water for dilution out of an ice melt absinthe drip fountain. The water was sweetened. 

I watched our very congenial bar tender mix drinks and realized he wasn't measuring his citrus, bitters or sweeteners, that's right, long pours and eye balling them. The only thing measured was booze. HOLY CAW! Where's the quality control?!

In the end this is a great little bar if you roll in with bales of cash. Cocktails run as high as 29 each, sharable ones in the 40s. The soundtrack, a weird melange of 80s and early 90s, leaves you wanting a little Kruder and Dorfmeister, and the drinks are so sweet you think that Willy Wonka is behind the counter. Everyone there was perfectly friendly, but the construction, the measurement, the execution needs a serious rethinking.
