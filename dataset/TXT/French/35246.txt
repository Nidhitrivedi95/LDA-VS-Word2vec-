Ht-_i0UAq7YDBaqJwcQMdQ I have heard montreal is a foodie town...afterall it's the 2nd biggest city in the country, so the choices must be good.   At this point it's been about 8 months since my meal.  But i walked out of it with my friends completely delighted.  The risotto is the house specialty, and fantastic.  The ambiance was a lot of fun; almost a lounge feel but high end.  And most importantly, an incredibly helpful staff who never rushed us.  It was the first of 2 great eating experiences in this city.  Worth a visit if you haven't been.
