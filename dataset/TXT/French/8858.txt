4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Well... Oohh la Laaa!!! :)

This place is great!!!

Greeted by a nice lady at the front and was seated quickly. The waitor was nice and pleasant. He went over the wine list with me and seemed very knowledgeable about what they had to offer.
Sweeet!!

We didn't have any starters, we just ordered dinner.

I went for the fish and chips...

Now this is odd as this is a more English dish rather than French... Ohh well, odd but I fancied it.... Ohh my THIS WAS THE YUMMIEST BLOODY COD I'VE EVER HAD.... Wooosh

Everyone else at my table went for the stake so obviousely I had to try some steak from my sister's plate... (hee heee) And yes, the steaks were really tastey and juicy....

I really like their chips too... slim and crispy and not too oily... So enjoyed that too...

The price was reasonable and we all had a good time here.. Really hope to be back soon... :)
