My partner had the spicy sloppy joes made with short rib on a baguette. Unfortunately, there wasn't  a lot of flavor but it was tender. Matthew, the bartender was great, he provided good suggestions on the wine and great service. We also had a steak tartare that was very good.  I would definitely try this place again, the atmosphere is very quaint.
