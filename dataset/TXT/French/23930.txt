cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg Nice atmosphere and great foie gras. We strolled over on a Saturday night and got a table right away (party of 2, do not try with a group: 6 people right behind us were told it was about a 2-month wait for group reservations...). We opted for the smallest seafood platter, followed by a "foie gras tout nu" ("bare naked foie gras", which actually comes on a bread and a balsamic vinegar reduction), and the must-have "canard en conserve" ("duck in a can"). Definitely too much food for the 2 of us, but it was hard not to want to order everything on the menu. 
Good to know: 
- for reservations, call the restaurant and leave a message with your reservation information; they will then call you back to confirm so plan ahead. We tried same-day and we didn't get a call back but walk-in worked. If you are a group, be sure to call a couple of months in advance.
- the cans of "canard en conserve" at the entrance of the restaurant are for display only.
