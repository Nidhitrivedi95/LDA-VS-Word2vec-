gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg The Flamm (flat bread w/ cheese and toppings) was really good and so was the poutin (fries with cheese curds and gravy) but I agree w/ Holly T. this place was like corporate chain acting like a local pub or micro brewery. I probably won't go back to Les Trois Brasseurs just because of the corporate-feel of the place.

They have four beers they make; a white, an amber, a brown and a blonde beer. The prices were sort of middle of the road prices, not super affordable but not overpriced either. All in all, just skip it.
