aSC-WLyJptVpziJpR98Ykg The best dinner my wife have had in several years. Fresh ingredients mixed in imaginative ways and cooked to perfection. Careful thought was put into every aspect of their business: the tableware was unique and elegant; we especially loved the heavy cast-iron individual teapots. Even the sink in the bathroom was beautiful: the water flows over a stone slab that you place your hands under. For appetizers I had the almond gazpacho (wonderful) and my wife had fresh tomatoes in olive oil served on top of goat (?) cheese and with exquisite fried kalamata olives. For the main course she had the lobster served de-shelled with a lobster bisque topping and lying on top of a spring roll stuffed with mushrooms. I had the sea bass served with fresh vegetables, a creamy dill sauce and I believe risotto. For desert I had the ice cream/sorbet sampler (vanilla, coffee, pineapple, tangerine, and pink grapefruit) and my wife had the creme brulee sampler (ginger, chocolate, mint, and lime). Even my anise tea was delicious. Highly recommended.
