udFcIcbWbxrO8uLF95WnQg Enjoyed a fantastic dinner at Cowell & Hubbard before the Book of Mormon at the Playhouse. The service was literally as good as it gets. I called the day of to get a reservation and the girl who took my call was able to get us a seat ( even though they were booked for the night). 

The food was exceptional. We started off with the Mushroom Bisque and the tomato gazpacho. Very fresh and the perfect amount for a starter. I had the whole roasted chicken and my date had the duck. Both dishes were excellent.

The kitchen did a fantastic job spreading out the service so we didn't feel rushed yet we had plenty of time until the show started.  The servers were some of the best I've had.  

I can't recommend Cowell & Hubbard enough for any occasion especially before a show at the Playhouse.  I do recommend calling a few days ahead to get a reservation.
