XNvklghmapxOlCB-wGv_sA If I had Steak Frites in my hometown, I would definitely have heart trouble.  Why?  Because I'd be here every night!  

The menu is what you'd expect from a steak frites bistro:  limited and perfectly edited.  It is, after all, a steak frites restaurant, not an international buffet.  Sometimes we Americans don't get simple elegance.  If you've been to Paris, you know what you're walking into at any bistro.  A few things done well...or medium rare, for that matter.

BYO Wine means you can have wine without the typical and ridiculous restaurant mark-up.  Don't let it deter you.  It's definitely a benefit.  Take advantage of it.

Our server was attentive, funny, and even a bit flirtatious.  Smart way to earn your tip!  

The steak was tender and perfectly-portioned, served with delicious haricot verts, and a wonderful green peppercorn sauce.  Did I mention the 'all you can eat' frites?  No?  Well, come hungry, and leave happy!

Overall, Steak Frites is a winner in my book.  Now, who do I speak to in order to get a Steak Frites franchise in the US?
