XKPosZx2j4RHcZ8Ewdwj0A We missed our dinner reso downtown and this was an excellent local choice in a pinch. Plats délicieux; late night prix fixe options; and a buzzing bistro atmosphere.

Drink your wine, nibble your bread and feast on your food. We shared the following dishes: Arugula and fennel salad with lemon dressing and parmesan; short rib with barley with an amazing wine sauce and swiss chard and mint peso (A grade dish); duck confit with potatoes; and panko crusted goat cheese, apple & walnut salad. Everything was really good. We weren't hungry until 4 or 5 pm the next day.

Perfect happy hibernating food.
