Wb9VqNZCq-ZgIlhb4ZDT5A This restaurant is a MUST TRY in Montreal. It has very few, but good reviews. Read about it in one of the blogs. We decided to give it a try and we can't believe the type of food they serve in such a simple but quaint little place in Plateau Mont Royal. The severs were very nice to explain to us in English all the items in their chalkboard menu. We have tried more formal dining places than this restaurant, but the food they serve here easily beats the more expensive stuff we tried in those, sometimes pretentious, places. It's THAT good. I had the tiramisu for dessert. It looked like a deconstructed version but it tasted wonderful. The price was very good for what they serve. Presentation and service were excellent. This is one place I will definitely go back to when I return to Montreal.
