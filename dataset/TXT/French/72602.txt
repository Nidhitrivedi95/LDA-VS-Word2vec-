XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q Food was superb but way too pricey and way too many courses!  There was either 7 or 16, but nothing in between.  So we got the 16 course chef tasting but I was so full after 10 courses so I only took a bite of each course afterwards.  16 course meal cost over $400/person.

They they need to create a 10 course chef tasting menu.
