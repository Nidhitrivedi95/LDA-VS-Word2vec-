teTQU7TIPE0O_B1zN_239w Of all the Mimi's I've been to in the Valley, this location could stand some improvements here and there... the female greeters at the front door are very nice and welcoming... although some of the male staff seemed to be put off my having to take our order (at approx. 4pm when not busy)... then, he brough plain iced tea and threw down 2 straws and walked away... we actually ordered the raspberry and there was no lemon... quite a while later, when he set down the check without asking if we'd like more, we asked for a refill with the correct tea... he just walked away as if was put out to do his job... we looked at the check and for $2.59/each drink it seemed rather high... that reminded us that earlier in the week when we stopped in for lunch, the waitress charged us each for 2 refills... wow!  Won't be going back to this location again, and will definitely ask if there's a fee for refills if make it back to any of the other newly-renovated locations.  For the prices, which granted is good consistent quality food, down't seem like too much to expect free refills.
