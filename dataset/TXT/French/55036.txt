rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A We came here for breakfast during our trip.  The view was nice.  I had the Oeuf, which came with 2 brioche slices of bread, eggs any style, 2 potato croquettes, and a side of your meat choices (sausages or bacon), and I, of course, chose the bacon.  The brioche toasts were a little dry, the 2 potato croquettes were quite nice (dipped in ketchup), poached egg was fine, and the side of bacon was nice and crispy.  My friend had the Bouchon French Toast, and that tasted something in between a custardy bread budding mixed with flan flavorings.  I was pleasantly surprised with the miniature bottles of Tabasco sauce!
