6fPQJq4f_yiq1NHn0fd11Q I have ate at this creperie for a couple of years now. I actually just ate there two weekends ago. I really did not enjoy the crepes. First of all, the concept of this place is perfect. It is located in Paris near the buffet. You can actually watch them make the crepes. In some sort of a way, it is almost like art. The lady with the long pony tail did not make it like art. I know there were a lot of people and she was rushing, but she was kind of sloppy and throwing them all together really quick. I think if she took her time a little more and put a little more love in making them, that they would actually be better. The best part about the crepes is the menu. You have sweet and savory options. I had the monte cristo.I would of liked more cheese that was melted, less turkey and ham, and a more flavorful bechemel sauce. I would of liked more powdered sugar and more micro basil. But, it was decent.
