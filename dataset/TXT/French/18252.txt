A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g I ordered a chocolate later cake for my parents' birthdays with fresh raspberries and couldn't have been more pleased. The cake was light, delicious and what made it extra special was that they used fresh raspberries in the filling between layers, not the typical preserves. I highly recommend Patisserie Manon for any special occasion cake.
