fyJAqmweGm8VXnpU4CWGNw I am editing this review. I did not have a good experience at French grocery the two times that I went. I know plenty of people who have enjoyed their experiences there, but for me, the service was lacking and the food was not good. Yesterday I posted a pretty angry review about my experience there in the morning. Since then, the owner of the store, Erin, called me to learn more about the situation and to apologize for something that happened yesterday. On the phone, she was genuinely kind and caring and I am glad that she reached out. This still would not be my ideal go to for coffee and a croissant. I have not been for dinner, and so maybe it is a different experience in the evening- as several of the reviews below reference dinner and wine.
