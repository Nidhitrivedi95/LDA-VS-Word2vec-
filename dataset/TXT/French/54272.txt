rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw HANDS DOWN THE BEST FRENCH TOAST I'VE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE!  It is pillowy soft heaven on a plate.  Apparently, they soak the massively thick cut brioche in their custard mixture overnight to get it so moist and delicious!  It is so creamy yet light in texture and not too sweet.  You may not even need to spread that dollop of vanilla mascarpone but it is loaded with vanilla bean--yum!  It certainly adds more decadent richness to the dish.  The French toast is set off quite nicely with crunchy almond brittle.  It is also paired with an orgeat (almond) syrup, which just adds another flavor layer to the party...but honestly, the French toast on its own is superb!  This is definitely a must have if dining here for brunch.  I also added the double cut bacon (pork belly fans will love this) and poached eggs which were cooked perfectly.  It turned out to be a lot of food so next time I'll just have the French toast with the bacon!  Service and ambiance were great as well.  Can't wait to try Bardot for dinner next time we're in Vegas.
