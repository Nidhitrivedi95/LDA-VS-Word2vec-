4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I really like this place. It's not cheap but the food is great and the ambiance matches it. We came for lunch and boy am I glad we did.

We were seated inside but close enough to the outside where we still get a great view but far enough inside to not feel the outside heat.

Hot house bread. Was a nice touch. It comes in a bag.

Chicken paillard ($19) was freaking delicious but the portion size is small. The classic steak frites ($25) was also really good and the portion size was perfect. Not sure why portion sizes are inconsistent.

Our server was laid back and cool. She took good care of us.

Desserts lacked a bit. We ended up the strawberry briand. It was literally a bowl of plain strawberries with a dollop of sour cream. Save your $9 bucks and make this yourself at home. Go next door to Sugar Factory after for dessert.
