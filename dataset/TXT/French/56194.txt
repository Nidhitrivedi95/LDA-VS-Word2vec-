rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Went here on Saturday morning after thanksgiving as a treat for my daughter in law who had wanted to go here for dinner. We went for the brunch instead. What an amazing place and actually not very expensive considering its one of the best French restaurants on the strip. Everyone had a delicious experience but I have to focus on my two favorites. I had the most amazing French toast I've ever had. The bread base is amazingly fresh and tasty. Then topped with a healthy helping of fresh blueberry compote and creme fraiche. It also comes with warm real maple syrup but I didn't need that as the compote was terrific. We also ordered a quartet of their pastries. Absolute heaven! A blueberry muffin, a chocolate almond croissant, a peach Danish and two raspberry beignets. Can't wait to go back next time we're in Vegas. This is a do not miss place. Service was impeccable. Best of all they don't take reservations for brunch and we walked up around 9 in the morning and were seated immediately.
