mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q My crew went with the "Club Menu" supplemented with some fois gras.  I am not a huge egg fan so the egg thing didn't do much for me.  For my main course I went with the ribeye that was melt in your mouth good.  I can still feel the famous mashed potatoes in my arteries...well worth it though...  The array of tarts for desert were incredible.  Fantastic service.  The place is a bit cramped I found...can't wait to try his restaurant next door.  16 course tasting anyone?
