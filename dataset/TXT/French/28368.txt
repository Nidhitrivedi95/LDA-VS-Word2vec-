EEIz44ewHhOKmfTloAK13g Food is complex with a depth and variety of flavors and textures. Quality and tastes are exactly what you would expect from a Michelin caliber restaurant. This is on par with 3 Michelin starred Joel Robuchon in Las Vegas, but without the theatrics and financial punishment. It is quite difficult to secure a reservation given the size of the restaurant and the small number of tables, but this is why Service was so personal and outstanding. Every member of the staff flows reminiscent of a choreographed ballet. It really is quite something to watch in itself.
