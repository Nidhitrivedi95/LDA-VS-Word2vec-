hzyvL2v97xLzLbLXcdi1uw As a Frenchman, I want to say that what this place offers is not even remotely close to savory French crepes. The so called "classic" section of the menu does not propose the basic ham-cheese-egg crepe. A quick chat with the owner revealed that he didn't even know that crepes are traditionally served with cider (note that I don't blame him for not serving alcohol). They use regular flour instead of buckwheat flour. The avocados in the Bristol crepe weren't ripe. The Alaskan crepe was OK.
Positive notes: nice interior design and polite staff.
