I had the five course meal with my boyfriend and we loved the fine dining experience!

They serve fresh bread in various assorments: french, bacon and cheddar, chocolate coffee, rosemary, and pretzel. 

First course I had the pea soup which was very tasty and had beautiful presentation. My boyfriend had the yellowtail sashimi and it had a very bold, citrus flavor that he loved. 

Second course was foie gras which was tender and creative use of apples and caramel sauce. 

Third course I had sea bass which was so tender and juicy. The wine sauce was amazing and my boyfriend had a scallop which was tender, delicious, and well balanced. 

Fourth course I had lamb which was absolutely AMAZING. It was a perfect medium and it was juicy and full of amazing flavor. My boyfriend had the chicken and he thought it was well marinated and he loved the gravy. 

The last course was dessert which I had Crème brûlée. It was the best I've ever had. The tart was perfect and creamy. My boyfriend had a chocolate ball with ice cream inside and the chocolate ball melted as they poured chocolate over it. Also, they give four small french desserts (macaroons, etc) in a very creative dish filled with brown sugar. 

We were also given a small tasting of salmon from the chef, and a souvenir box with bon bons inside. One of my favorite parts was the palatte cleanser. It was a nonalcoholic sangria inside of a bon bon or something and it just pops in your mouth and cleans it all out! It was a lot of fun, and it was an amazing dining experience. 

I would highly recommend coming to this restaurant and I hope that I can come here again soon.
