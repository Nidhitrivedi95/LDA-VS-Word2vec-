It always looks like it won't be enough food but it is always perfect.  Pastries are great and they are the only place that I know that brews Illy coffee.  If you never tried Illy coffee before, go now.  It is one of the BEST coffees I've ever had.  Whether it's breakfast or lunch, doesn't matter what you order-you will love it. Once you find it, you'll be hooked.
