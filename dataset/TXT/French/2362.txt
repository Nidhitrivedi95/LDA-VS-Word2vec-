0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g I came to Picasso on a recommendation and an urge to treat myself. I came a bit early for my reservation and saddled up next to the bar. The bartender asked me if I wanted a drink menu, or if he could come up with something on the spot. I told him my preference for bourbon, and he hit the lab. Buffalo Trace mixed with who knows what else, I was too distracted by the amazing art. On my first sip, I knew it was a winner.

I was told that patio seating was the way to go, but little did I know that I'd be getting a table that overlooks the Bellagio fountains, which went off in a spectacular show no less than six times during my meal.

Being in an ambivalent mood, I went with the taster menu and asked for a recommendation for wines aimed at the front and back half. First up was an amazing croquette that was soft and crispy, with the most amazing side of potato leek soup, chilled. It was paired with Serrano ham, and was a perfect entry point for the rest of the meal.

There was a lobster salad that, as a Mainer, I can say was as good an execution on the ingredient as I've ever seen. A beautiful scallop dish that was absolutely perfect. My entree was lamb and it, too, did not disappoint.

This was, without a doubt, one of the best meals I've ever eaten. If you're ever in the area and looking to go all-out on an unforgettable meal, Picasso is the way to go.
