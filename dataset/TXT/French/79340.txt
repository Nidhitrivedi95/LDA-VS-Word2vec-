ZIQrmmK86wQXVowgLsjW5A Paul Kitching doesn't have his star for nothing. Yours is refined, beautiful food without - I should hasten to add - too much of the over-the-top stuff he was famous for when he ran Juniper in Altrincham half a decade or so ago.

The food - and accompanying wines (after too much indulgence elsewhere on our trip around Scotland, we decided to go easy and not take the full wine flight) - are a dream. This is Michelin-starred cooking without the high-strung frantic uber-fashion that you will sometimes find. It is refined fine dining to enjoy. Highly recommended!
