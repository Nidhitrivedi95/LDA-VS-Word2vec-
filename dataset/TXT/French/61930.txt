Sr-DO1Nt8X4I4Pjxapwz-g My daughter told me about this place, so I thought I would try it out. My friend and I went today and had a chichen pot pie, and peach pie for dessert.  They were both perfect.  You can tell someone knows what they're doing in the kitchen.  The service was great to.  I will be back to try the menu out.
