ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug I love the Paris hotel so it saddens me that my experience at Le Cafe was not good. The main reason? The people. From the person who seated me to the person who waited on me. They seemed unhappy, almost indifferent. And the service was very slow. By the way, my experience at Mon Ami Gabi was outstanding! Go there!
