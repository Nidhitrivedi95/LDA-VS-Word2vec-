aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw Unlike carlos bakery this place has it right. The cheese Danish is excellent and so is the croissant. I also had the sticky bun at the restaurant and it was good not sure if its offered at the bakery. I found two locations one by the palazzo and one in the Venetian. If you go to restaurant they have 25% off any bakery purchase at the bakeries.
