T4g4k2OhCTsiqcP-ZXElHQ I love Jules Bistro! Our second time there tonight and was so impressed I had to write a review.

We had the chef's pick appetizer platter (I forget the exact name.. but its the 2nd on the menu for $10). Good to share between my boyfriend and I. There was bread, pickles, meats, cheeses and caramelized onion? It was fun to build your own bite size sandwich :)

We each got a veal chop - it's on the chalkboard and not on their menu. Decent portion of meat with a pile of fries and salad. Highly recommend!!!!!
