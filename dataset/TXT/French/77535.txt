YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g this place was surprisingly great! the food and the service were both awesome, especially considering we had 13 people at dinner. i felt like we ate a lot and the bill wasn't too grand--$60 pp, alcohol and gratuity included. 

Some of my favs: 
scallop borscht (best dish of the night) 
steak tartare 
peking duck 
tuna tacos 
tomahawk ribeye 
coconut soup 
cheesecake lollipops 
skirt steak 

Things that were good, but not amazing: 
mac n' cheese (too fishy tasting) 
mussels 
hummus plate 
gnocchi 
mushroom ragout 
artichoke 
chicken croquettes 
sliders 
afforgatto 

Fleur is definitely a gem in Vegas.
