KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA I'm a fan of good escargot and good French wine so I really do appreciate Marché Bacchus for that. Some of the dishes are better than others. On my last visit I had the escargot, muscles, octopus, cheese plate, crème brûlée and French wine. The escargot was excellent, the muscles were dry and the octopus was semi-burnt. The cheese and meat plate was good, the Crème brûlée was really good. It's generally difficult to find a good crème brûlée in this town so I was delighted to have found that. I'll continue going back to Marché Bacchus for the escargot, wine and crème brûlée but I don't know if would opt for any entrees. I've been underwhelmed by the entrees a number of times. As always, the service is really good and so is the atmosphere.
