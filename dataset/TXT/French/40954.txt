kcF-en40P3J9L8nLy5lKqQ Amazing menu.  I need to go back and try everything on it. 

Cocktails are tasty and creative.  My hubs and I each started with one, and a half dozen oysters.  Then he got the mac and cheese of the moment (shortrib and mushroom) - it was amazing... I kept reaching across the table to steal bites.  I got the pasta with clams.  Really tasty, bonus points for house-made pasta. 
Everything was flavorful and pretty large portions.  Menu is on the pricier side, which may prevent us from going weekly... but the service and ambience validate the price.   I really appreciate all of the "of the moment" daily specials.  Lots of great touches - like getting offered citrus of choice (lemon, lime, orange) on a platter with your water.  We are looking forward to going to back and trying more of the menu.   Also plan on coming for happy hour... great addition to the neighborhood!
