FChZqoNWuLZr5Lj28Cq7yg My husband and I have begun to frequent this charming, quaint spot for weekend brunch. A gem like this is a very pleasant surprise in the West End neighborhood. The few times we have visited, the wait staff has always been very attentive and warm. The owner is a great retired vet who always makes a point of stopping by each table to greet customers and say "hello." The real is their fabulous quiche. It was fluffy, tender, flaky perfection - it will absolutely keep us coming back!
