The sandwiches are expensive, but very tasty (I've had the smoked chicken with bacon and the tuna) - plus you get a small side salad. The americano was decent enough as was the cappuccino. Their dark roast is pretty good too.

A strange occurrence happened today when I ordered a croque madame (basically a grilled cheese with egg and ham). I only saw the egg-less version in the display, so I asked if it was possible to get it with egg. The server was non-committal, as if he had to check with someone. I waited a bit while others were served and I was asked for my order again. I said I was waiting on a croque madame, but I'd take the egg-less version if they couldn't provide. They started toasting up the egg-less version for me. Then, a fried egg appeared from the kitchen. I thought "awesome, they made an egg fresh for me". Some big guy not dressed like the servers saw the egg, grabbed the plate and chucked it in the garbage! When I suggested that said egg belonged on my sandwich, he curtly responded that they don't have any croque madames any more today. 

I'll continue coming for the occasional pastry and sandwich, but I don't think I'll try my luck ordering anything that isn't in front of me anymore (regardless of it's existence on their menu).
