SCklYa_jhihWAcfIn-_chg there has got to be something right about a restaurant that makes one patron order the same thing that brings turmoil to his stomach and digestive system each time he goes back.  

BUT ITS SO TASTY.  next time you see me at Bonjour, if I have a tasty meatloaf sandwich smothered with dijon and carmelized onions on a french baguette, remind me of this review and try to wrestle it away from me.

If its nice, sit on their dainty patio as the inside can be pretty tight both by its setup and when its packed, which is kind tantamount to saying, when its open.  ive also had bowls of latte, salad specials, and soups and never have I had a disappointing meal.
