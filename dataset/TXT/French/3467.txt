-Lobster bisque: The best I ever had. It tastes like the sea. Awesome flavour. It's not heavy with cream. 
-Steak tartare: The best I ever had. Very tasty. Nicely seasoned. 
-Foie Gras "Au Naturel" & Black Trumpet Croquette: It melts in my mouth. I must say this is my favourite dish of the evening. The richness of the foie gras and pungent flavour of the trumpet is just spectacular.
-Rack of Lamp: It is SO tendered.
-Seared Scallop, King Crab, Beurre Blanc Poached Lobster & Acadian Caviar: The waiter suggest we get the main because the appertizer portion will be too small to share. Seared scallop is paired with pear which is a perfect pairing. 
-Praline souffle have a hint of orange. It's light and just the right amount of sweetness.

Service is great. Waiter is very helpful.

I think this might be my favorite restaurant in Toronto!
