ZdaZwXC0FByDY3EwNELphw Union is a must try when in Toronto.  A french bistro with a Canadian flare, Union is an exceptional restaurant.  One of the many charms is that they use ingredients from local farms and butchers.  I will say that I preferred their lunch and dinner to their brunch.  The brunch is good, but similar to many brunch spots.  But it is at lunch and dinner that Union shines.  Great selection of oysters.  And all their main dishes are so well prepared.  And on Tuesday nights, they have $12 plates!

And if you are up for an experience (and have a party of 2) - get the Cote de Boeuf if they have it on the menu.  A huge steak that fills the stomach and the soul.
