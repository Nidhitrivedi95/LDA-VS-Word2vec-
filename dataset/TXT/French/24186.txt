cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg Was it extravagantly rich? Yes. Did we drink too much wine? Yes. Would I go back again? Yes. In a heartbeat. 

APDC was the highlight of my trip to Montreal. From the amuse of little fried croquettes of foie to the still bubbling maple pudding we had for dessert, every moment was rich, smokey, porky, and delicious. 

Along with the food, service was great. I don't remember our server's name, but she was enthusiastic, didn't try to oversell us, and incredibly helpful as we tried to put together the perfect meal. She helped pick out a delightful bottle of wine as well. Light and bright, it cut through the richness of our meal perfectly. Her recommendation of a calvados to sip at the end of the evening was exactly what we needed. 

Would we have eaten more? Yes. Absolutely, but I didn't bring any pants with a waistband stretchy enough to handle the amount of dishes I only wished I could have tried. Montreal you were beautiful APDC, you were bewitching with your luxurious ways. I will be back.
