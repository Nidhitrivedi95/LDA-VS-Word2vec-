4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I had this place bookmarked for good ambiance. We walked from the Flamingo our last morning in Vegas for a nice breakfast. We got seats right on the edge of the patio, so we could see the sidewalk and, across the street, the Bellagio. The fountains weren't running in the morning but it was still a nice view. And the people watching was excellent, as it is in Vegas! We had good service by our waiter, who brought things out quickly and was always nearby. I ordered steel cut oats, a bagel with cream cheese, and OJ. My friend got a breakfast crepe. She wasn't that impressed by it as she didn't like the sauce, but it wasn't bad. She said the coffee was amazing. My OJ was good, though small for the price. My oatmeal was great and so was the bagel. The oatmeal came with raisins, brown sugar, and half and half on the side, so I could make it up as I pleased. 

Price was comparable to other breakfast places we tried in Vegas, and quality was good. The view made it all worth the while. I only wish I could've had lunch here and seen the fountains!
