rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I'm a sucker for breakfast food and while in Vegas this past week for a conference my friend and I made our way to Bouchon for breakfast not once, but twice in two days.  The decor is beautiful, but then again everything in or on the Venetian is beautiful right? I had two different experiences each day. 

Day 1- Omelet du jour (spinach, mozzarella and tomato) and a side of bacon and the Strawberry champagne cocktail. 
- The presentation was lovely, the omelet was perfectly whipped and was almost too pretty to eat. The gravy boat of bacon was also a treat. However, I felt like the omelet was served luke warm and wasn't "done" enough on the inside and I got the feeling our waitress wasn't too thrilled to be at work that day. Lastly, my cocktail was too syrupy...the flavor was quite artificial. 

Day 2-
Sour Dough waffle - Totally different experience! The waffle was detectible, light and fluffy and the vanilla bean butter melted in my mouth! I would go back again and again for this dish. My cocktail the "75" was fantastic and perfectly balanced and lastly, our waitress was very sweet and friendly. 

Next time I'm Vegas, I would like to try the restaurant for a meal other than breakfast/brunch.
