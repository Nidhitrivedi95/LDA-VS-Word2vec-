4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw One of my must visit spot every time I visit Vegas. 

Absolutely love their Smoked salmon platter. It's served with bagels or toast. I've dined in and ordered Togo. The foods still delicious. It is very busy so go early. I also found out Sunday's are not as busy in the early AM.
