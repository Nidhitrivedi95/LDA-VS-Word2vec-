Let me begin with the good: we each had a curious George cocktail, and it was the be best cocktail we ever had.  They yellowtail was also exquisite - fresh and buttery. The breads, the butter, the little details were all great.  Now for the bad: first, the degustation menu ($138 per person for 5 courses) does not allow for a couple to order a separate dish for each course without at least one person having to pay a "supplement," which is anywhere from $40-$70 dollars.  For us, this meant that we had to order two of the same plates for two courses, but we ended up paying for one supplement, just to try something different.  This took a lot of the fun out of the menu, because it suddenly shot up to $200 for one person for one different small dish.  Second, the seared foie gras was simply worse than any foie gras I have ever had - it had a strong, musty smell, and was cold and curdled in the middle.  The main course (we were stuck with chicken because the other option besides the sea bass - which we had already ordered -- required a big $$ supplement), was really mediocre.  It was a lump of tepid chicken breast with gooey skin and gravy on top.  There was nothing spectacular about it, and it was so overdone that it could not compare to a good roast chicken salted early at a home kitchen.  The service was good, but the waiters would zoom by and say, ""how is everything, delicious?" and when we would not answer, they would zoom away.  Not sure what they could have done, but the food just was not as good as it should have been for the amount of $$, nor was it particularly interesting.  $500 for this meal felt like a pretty serious rip off when compared to some of the other restaurants we enjoyed in Vegas for a quarter of the price.
