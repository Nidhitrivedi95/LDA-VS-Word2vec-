rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w Just fabulous! Definitely  in my list. My husband brought me here for our 3rd year anniversary and this place is just perfect! We had their tasting menu with 6 courses not including the chef's choice of soup. We started with the Ruinart Champagne with our seat right next to the window overlooking the dancing fountain. The highlight of my dinner was the foie gras although everything was great too.  Service is spot on and ambiance is perfect with intimate small amount of tables. Great food with wide selections of wines, great service, and fabulous view.
