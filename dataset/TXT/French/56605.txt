rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A One of the best places we ate at during our trip to Vegas.  We went on a Saturday morning for my wife's birthday and, despite a line, we were sat rather quickly.  Professional staff that makes everyone feel welcome - like southern hospitality.  When we were sat, the waitress explained the menu and the specials the restaurant had for the day.  She was extremely knowledgable on the menu, preparation and expected taste.  One of my personal pet peeves is when the staff can't articulate the menu.  Our server exceeded any expectation we had.  Great ambiance that captures a French cafe style.  

Bouchon may have the best brunch in Vegas.  Well worth the price and any wait to be seated.  The chicken and waffles were amazing and the French toast was some of the best I've ever eaten.  If you have one place to eat breakfast, this is it.
