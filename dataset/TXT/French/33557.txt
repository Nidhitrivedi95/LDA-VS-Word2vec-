hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA How on Earth does this place have more than 3 stars???

I have had the joint bookmarked for close to a year. I was off on Friday, and decided to meet a friend and her son for lunch. We got there at 12:30, which was just in time to beat the afternoon rush. 

We were greeted by a European man with a lovely accent, who was very helpful. I settled on the chipotle sandwich with chicken and bacon, ginger ale and the infamous chocolate tart. My total was around $17, so I was expecting greatness. 

Service was excellent. Our food was out in less than 5 minutes. I was a little disappointed when I looked down at my plate and saw a white roll, what looked like deli chicken and a side of lightly dressed greens. There was absolutely nothing special about the sandwich. It tasted good, but it was pretty plain. Someone in my party ordered the chicken salad. It literally looked like a bagged salad, and it was around $8. Quinzos, Earl of Sandwiches, Subway, Starbucks... just naming a few places were you can buy a cheaper, tastier sandwich or salad.

After eating my sandwich, I just knew I was going to be blown away by the chocolate tart. Disappointed again! It tasted store bought. Nothing that I'd ever order again.

The ginger ale was good. Bottled of course. I'd go back for that.
