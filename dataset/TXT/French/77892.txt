YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g Beautifully presented food and great service.  A nice assortment of cocktails and wine.  This hungry girl, however, is not a small plates kind of gal especially at Fleur's prices.

Dining with a large group (approx. 10) always tests the limits of good service at a restaurant and Fleur gets high marks for meeting the needs of our group.  We were all curious about the "get everything on the menu" option for $415 but there were too many of us that were queasy about one menu item or another.

Plates ordered included a cheese plate, skirt steak, kobe sliders, hummus, meatballs and lobster mac n cheese.  While the dishes looked good, I have to say that my unsophisticated palate just found everything to be "ok."  Everything was soooooooo tiny.  The sliders I could eat in just one bite.  The skirt steak at $22 gave me about four bites.  $72 later I was still starving and felt compelled to buy Oreos in the hotel gift shop (ok, I admit, that probably would have happened anyway).

If you have a large appetite like me then don't come here when you're really hungry. There is nothing here that would compel me to return unless I happen to be staying at the Mandalay Bay and want to grab a drink and a "snack."
