3FlWR_osNPb8dcqLgHebHw I love Mimi's Cafe for one simple reason. French Onion Soup! It always comes out hot and tasty. I generally order a bowl as my meal.
I used to get the mini wedge before my soup but have stopped because the wedge of lettuce they bring out has been frozen with ice all over it the last 3 times. 
The service is ok, but I for sure recommend paying with cash because not once but twice my credit card was compromised after eating at this location. I don't like how the server takes off with your card and you can't see what is going on.
Also, the servers must need to meet some sort of requirement for foods purchased because they are always leaving certain things off the receipt to get you to buy muffins or dessert to be able to use the common $10 off any $30 meal coupon that comes in the paper. 
Bottom line,  I love the French Onion Soup too much not to go here but I will always triple check my bill and always pay with cash.
