B_0VW7Pw26YiQyDRuutIGQ I've been waiting an hour and a half for an omelette. I'm literally starving at the table. My coffee took 25 minutes to get here and is now cold. The place is nearly empty... Maybe they're waiting for the hen to lay the eggs. 

Thru haven't even offered us bread while we wait.
