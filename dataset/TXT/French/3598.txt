1ThbwFVBL9YA2oOM11iO7g Brunch in Toronto is usually very depressing.  Aunties & Uncles excepted, the waiting is just not worth it.  Delux is different.  You can go on Saturday and have a wonderful sandwich and feel happy about your life instead of looking down at a plate of wimpy hash browns, wondering where it all went wrong.
