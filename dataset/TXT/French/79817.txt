zra20XPGVL9P3i5hMoKjig Went to Nonna's last night (Saturday) for an early dinner. What a splendid surprise! Can't wait to take my grown children there next time they're in town. We sat at a table right by the kitchen and interacted with the charming husband and wife team. The husband is Italian and clearly the head chef. The wife is right there beside him, though, preparing delicious food. Additionally there is a great soul chef. We both had the lobster farro risotto with enoki mushrooms. I as amazed at how much lobster this moderately priced dish contained. It was a real treat. The space is charming. The service would be improved by the addition of another wait person but they kept up reasonably well. We got a hug from the wife before we left. Great experience!
