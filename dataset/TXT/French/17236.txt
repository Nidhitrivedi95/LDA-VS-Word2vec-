9iy6scMRbs5ue41XRLGEkw We decided to return for restaurant week to a place we've enjoyed in the past. Unfortunately, we were all disappointed. Firstly, when a table orders a bottle of wine, most upscale restaurants do not pour out the entire bottle and fill up each glass to the max. Restaurants typically provide an adequate pour and then return to fill glasses as necessary. The appetizer, shrimp stuffed calamari, was an extremely small portion and not flavorful. Frankly, the meal portions (two of us had halibut and two filet) appeared as if they had divided each fish/meat cut into two servings. Yes, one could say these are "French portion sizes" but given we eat at French restaurants frequently in Chicago and elsewhere, this appeared more to be a cost savings endeavor than an intensional cultural norm. My halibut was too chewy, overdone, and it came on a bed of cold green veggies. The escargot arrived, too, not hot, and without the typical crusty bread. When I complained to the owner as he circled tables that my halibut was too chewy, he didn't apologize but said, "I will let my chef know."  Okay then. The desserts were the only bright spots.  It may have been the preparations for Restaurant Week fell flat, but there was something about the atmosphere, especially the owners attitude, that frankly changed our opinion about this place. We won't be back.  Three stars are generous for what should have been a special night out and pricing that even discounted made it not worth the costs.
