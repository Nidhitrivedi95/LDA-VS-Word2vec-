vg55SAkrEmuHpWfIMtJjBQ I spent Friday night at the Butterjoint (legume's bar) with a group of four and had an awesome time. If you really like cocktails and Will, the bar manager, is working, I recommend being at the mercy of the bartender. Will is a student of  cocktails and made us some really delicious drinks.  The food is great. If you like burgers and the onion burger is on the menu the night you are there, do not skip it. I think it's the tastiest burger is town. Pittsburgh needs more places like Butterjoint/Legume.
