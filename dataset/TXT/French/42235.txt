KZKbv0vLfW2al37QSu5ZwQ Had a great lunch here on Labor Day. My wife and I were in the mood for a little more "french" fare so we tried this place. They just opened when we got there & got a table next to the window that opens up to Rue St.Paul so great for people watching! Our waitress spoke very good English & was very polite & smiled the whole time (I hate it when ppl look like they'd rather be elsewhere when serving you). Had the lamb shank w/ vegetables & soup & glass of red house wine plus 1/2 doz oysters as an app. My wife had the mussels & steak fries & sparkling water. Great food & atmosphere for less than $80US including tip!  If we're lucky enuff to come back I will certainly try the marinated wild boar!
