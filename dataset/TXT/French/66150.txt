ufwkkMd9yr9cFU1R5ONArg LOVE this place. I got the eggs Benedict, very impressed. Everything from the home fries to the salad was good. Service was fast and our server was helpful. I have been to other Mexican brunch places and this one wins every time. Just make sure to book a table before going as they get crowded very fast!
