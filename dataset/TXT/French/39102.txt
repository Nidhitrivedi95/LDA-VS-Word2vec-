jo4KmAqlZ7vxjHIP7IIkAw A group of us headed here this past week for a little birthday brunch. 

While the food was not short on taste, it was also not incredibly standout. I had Eggs Natasha (benny with smoked salmon hash) which was nice. The hollandaise would have been better with some taste to it...it was incredibly flat. The meal still worked though. I will say that all of our meals were really nicely prepared and not one person had a complaint! 

Everyone enjoyed their freshly squeezed mamosas (7.95 each) and I was wishing I would have tried their fresh grapefruit mamosa! Next time!

Similarly to Susan G., we had some awkward confusion when we tried to split the bills. Next time we will mention it at the start (agreed Susan, it is always annoying to have to remember this!) but now we know. 

I would recommend La Gaffe overall! The birthday boy especially enjoyed the banana french toast and the banana chocolate cake (this is really amazing..and huge!!)
