HojKatUfX4UHWaPqtl63NQ Rivea is divine. My boyfriend and I dined here while attending the CES. The cuisine is outstanding and Chef Bruno's attention to detail and taste is impeccable. We love the interior and our sweet waitress was a delight. We will definitely visit Rivea again. Thanks for an amazing meal and the fabulous view.
