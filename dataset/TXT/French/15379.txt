6fPQJq4f_yiq1NHn0fd11Q We just had a late breakfast  and wanted a little  something  around 1.00pm. . We tried  their banana  foster  crepe. Their were 5 people  in line but they were all waiting  for their  order  . The counter  person never asked me to step up. I thought  they were just slow . I finally  asked  the person  in front of me . Once I ordered. I waited  for my order  but  I had to go check  on the order three times. The crepes were good with plenty  of bananas not much flavor .again service was not good
