That's right Michelle T, I'm stealing another one of your openings. Whatcha gonna do about it, punk? 

This Bouchon Bakery is located at the Venetian Hotel, right underneath an escalator. In reality, this is not really a bakery but more of a small stand that sells Bouchon pastries. It's no bigger than a Starbucks you'd find inside a grocery store. Even though it's small they still have a good amount of baked goods. They have things like macarons, cookies, breads, sandwiches, pain au chocolat, muffins, bread pudding and more. They also sell coffees and other drinks. After our brunch at the Bouchon restaurant upstairs, my wife and I stopped by the bakery to get some goodies to go. Since we ate a big brunch, we only bought a few items. This is what we bought;

Caramel Macaron http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw?select=sj466FYKhGU57ud0VuAQzg
Nutter Butter Cookie Sandwich http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw?select=6d6z_ZykwN8phHEamNR7bQ 

All three treats were really good, especially the carrot cake whoopee pie, which was one of the best tasting carrot cake treats I've ever tried. The caramel macaron was not the best I've had but it was still really good. The same thing can be said about their nutter butter cookie sandwich. 
The prices are good and the service is fast and friendly. 
If you like Bouchon's baked goods, or if you're a Bouchon virgin, then this little stand is worth checking out.
