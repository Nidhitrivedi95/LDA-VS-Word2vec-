dd3GZs6zW2t7BM0cbxAzvg I walk by this place all the time on my way to Loblaw's to get groceries, and I'd always wanted to try their prix fixe.  I finally came here one night for a celebratory evening with a friend.

Pros:
*Our first server was very good.  He helped us choose a great wine, and he took good care of us.
*The escargot was very nice - it's super lightly breaded and fried, which is unusual, but it tasted great and the tangy sauces + wild mushrooms went great with it.
*The house made sourdough was very nice, if a little dense, and the infused olive oil was very tasty.
*My friend ordered the steak frites and the fries were AWESOME. Super crispy.
*The prix fixe is a great deal.
*The decor is very lovely.
*I loved how their wine list is placed in an art book! And the selection, while small, is great.
*The dishes are presented beautifully.

Cons:
*The food wasn't that great, which is what I came for.
*The duck confit was dry, and I came here because I was craving the awesomely juicy one I had at Cafe St. Malo in Quebec City!  I also didn't like the wild rice and sauce it came with.
*My friend's steak was overcooked and tough.
*Our second server wasn't very good - she was very conspicuous in checking on us, which made me feel rushed.  She also tried to take away plates as we were still eating, and she brought out the wrong dessert for one of us.  She was polite, but just not very good at her job - but maybe she was new.
*The flourless chocolate cake wasn't as cocoa-y as I imagined it'd be and it was kind of dry.
*We ordered a vanilla creme brulee but we were brough a salted chocolate.  We didn't want to bother with waiting for the order to be corrected so we just went with it.  I did not like this at all!  There was a lot of salt in it and didn't taste like a dessert.  Not tasty.

So all in all, my curiosity about this place has been satisfied, and I don't see a reason to go back.
