I have eaten here a few times and it is consistently good, slick service and great food.

 Let's start with the decor, it's relatively warming, though a little sterile. Some tables look less welcoming than others, but the best seats in the house are at the u shaped bar. They have a shellfish display there which will make any seafood lover lose control.

I always have the steak tartare, and it is amazing, though if know this isn't for everyone's taste. Last time I went I had the whole plaice, with brown shrimps, which really was special. It was perfectly cooked and slipped off the bone, in a really light oil dressing, with capers, shallots and lemon juice - I'm salivating writing this. 

Service is always totally professional, which is to be expected of a restaurant carrying the name of the Galvin Brothers.

I don't have any kids, but if I did I would take them here for lunch on Sundays, why? Because there eat for free!!!
