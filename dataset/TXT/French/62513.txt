SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ Exceptional first courses set the tone for our dinner. The fois gras was sublime, the goat belly vindaloo of this world, and the cheese grits redefined a dish I would have never ordered except  it was gluten free (and they had many gluten free choices for our table of many food challenges). Very diverse and affordable wine list. We had an excellent Napa sparkling wine that was festive and nicely complemented the appetizers. Our mains included squid ink pasta, which was off the small plates menu but was a very generous portion, the bison steak, the game hen, and a squash gnocchi. Everything was exceptional except for the squash gnocchi, which was disappointingly bland. It is does not pay to be vegetarian in the West. Great service, wonderful patio, and a beautiful night. We planned our meal with my son and girlfriend after the ASU game had started, and the restaurant was wonderfully calm and only about half full. It can be packed at other times so a reservation is absolutely necessary.
