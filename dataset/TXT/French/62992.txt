SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA L'Albatros is definitely among my favorite fine dining restaurants in Cleveland. Nestled right in the middle of University Circle, the surrounding bohemian neighborhood consists of cultural gems such as Severance Hall, The Cleveland Museum of Art, Case Western Reserve and Wade Oval. This is a great dining option either before or after watching the Cleveland Orchestra -- rated as among the best orchestras in the world (they perform in Vienna for crying out loud).

My dishes of choice: any of the daily specials that are printed on the menu -- especially the fish. I'd include: escargot, mushroom french toast, duck cassoulet, duck confit, chicken confit... I'm sure I'm forgetting something, but once again, you can't go wrong.

The exterior is rather unassuming, much like Cleveland -- looks like nothing on the surface, but deep inside you'll find easy-going richness, culture, and pure awesomeness in a package that is lovable and unpretentious.
