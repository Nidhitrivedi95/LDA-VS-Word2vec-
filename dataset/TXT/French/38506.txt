JJ1Ruu37kn66YSWUmCKNCw I did not enjoy my meal here at this BYOB establishment.

The fried calamari was extremely oily.

The seafood linguini was tasteless.

The lentil soup was predictable and boring.

Perhaps the only redeeming dish was the mussels in a pot. 

Decided to give dessert a skip as I didn't think it would taste good.
