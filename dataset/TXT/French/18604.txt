Husband had the duck loaded with cheese in a bowl (I forgot the menu name) and his eyes almost popped out considering how big they were - in his words "this is amazing!". 

We didn't get our servers name but he was very friendly and gave us a few pointers of what to do on a monday night and also good places to go for smoked meat ^^
