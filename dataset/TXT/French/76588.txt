Yp9w4nhUowBU_IS_StFXbQ We stayed at the Wynn and Tableau was conveniently located downstairs as soon as we got of of the tower suite elevators.

THE BAD:  As soon as we walked in Larissa (the hostess) had an attitude. It wouldnt kill her to smile and greet guests! There were at least 10 empty tables but she made us sit and wait to get seated. She then escorted us to a table outside in the sun. When I asked if we can move to a shade she refused. We then asked if she can move the umbrella, she answered the umbrella can't be moved. Ok then at least move our table so we aren't getting roasted in 90 degree weather outside with the sun on our heads. Anyway she pulls out the chair and it's dirty, full of crumbs. I tell her umm the chair is dirty and she just stands there dumbfounded. I then had to take the napkin and clean the chair myself. 

THE GOOD: Delicious breakfast food! I ordered the banana bread French toast, Spanish omelet, and the acai booster. Also got freah squeezed green juice which was very refreshing. Gabriel was an awesome server and did a great job! He was very kind, attentive, and made great recommendations for us.
