JEXasd9XUHFbt_fIdmdK8g Ambiance:  Lovely!  From the moment you enter you are in a French Bistro.  We were seated at a very nice (but kind of uncomfortable) green velvet banquette and oval marble table.  Good location at the front of the restaurant since it was quiet enough to have a conversation.

Service: Excellent!  Several waitstaff attended to our table.  They were very accommodating and met all our requests.  Not one refused when we asked for a special food preparation etc.  They did not rush us but each course was timed perfectly once we had ordered.

Food:  Quite delicious.  The salted fish special was tasty and not the least bit too salty.  The duck was a bit too chewy but good.  The sweetbreads were so good we placed a second order!  All the vegetables were done to perfection.  The pineapple cake and floating cloud were both a perfect ending.

One small suggestion to the management:  Offer black napkins as well as white.  The lint from the white napkin was all over over black pants by the end of the evening.
