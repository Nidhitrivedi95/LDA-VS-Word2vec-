Kut9tVbDX_f7qKMRRoXg3w Maybe because i had an early lunch but the salad greens where way past there prime
I picked my way thru it and managed to eat about 1/2.  Waiter never checked back after delivering the salad. When I mentioned this to the manager he shouted back to the kitchen to "check the salads"
There are many dining options in the St Paul's neighborhood so avoid this one
