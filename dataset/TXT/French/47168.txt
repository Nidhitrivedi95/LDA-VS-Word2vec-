O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q One of the best restaurants inside of the Palazzo... A beautiful patio, friendly staff, great wine selection and delicious food. There are not enough good things that I can say. The cheese selection is large and has enough variety for any one who loves cheese. My favorites are the Greek salad, the Rigatoni and the table side chocolate mousse. I suggest Morels to all of my friends and family.
