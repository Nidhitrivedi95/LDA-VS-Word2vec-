BS0GcQ1kUag8YJ2qcBH2lQ Over priced, bad food, bad service in Yorkville.  

We were a group of 6 from work who went on a hot summer night.   The wine list is respectable, not amazing.    The food was just average to bad.  I had salmon which was dry and tasteless.   The 2 people in my party who had risotto were both ILL that night.    Our waiter was full of attitude but funny so we can forgive him for his typical Toronto jaded-waiter snobbery.   

VERY disappointing and especially in Yorkville where you might expect at least a very nice meal.   Don't waste your money here.
