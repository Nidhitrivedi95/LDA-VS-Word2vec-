cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg We went there a bit before the opening just to be sure to get a seat. The service was a bit slow but the waiters were very knowledgeable. We had a poutine au foie gras which was fantastic. It was very rich and went down nicely with a glass of white wine.  We also had the bison tongue and the horse tartare which were both interesting and tasty. I've also had the luck to try out their food truck, but it was not nearly the same experience and I definitely recommend going to the restaurant instead.
