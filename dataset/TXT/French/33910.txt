As soon as we walked into the door we where meant by a slender male who we later found out was from France and had a smile on his face the entire time we where at the restaurant.  My wife had a Moroccan sandwich with all sorts of spices from Africa and she said that it was delicious.  I had the Chipotle sand which.  This sandwich like the other one was grilled and had chicken and avacado and Mexican cheese on it.  While eating are sandwich's we had two large cups of hot chocolate which was perfect.  It was nice and chocolaty with the cinnamon on top and served at perfect drinking temperature.  I can't wait to go back and enjoy the food and atmosphere of this little cafe.
