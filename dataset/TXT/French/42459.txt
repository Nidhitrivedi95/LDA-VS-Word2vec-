LdD0yYLcHuamULrvZYY3Jg I don't know why I waited so long to come here... it was amazing!

What a romantic ambiance and gorgeous little spot. They have a tresses in the back as well just wasn't open last night because it was super hot and it's enclosed from what the waiter described to me.

Service is impeccable, you are greeted once you walk in and once you leave they walk you to the door pretty much. 

It's BYOW.. yes you read right BYOW!
What a delicious treat I didn't think a place with food this good would be a BYOW but of course it is and it makes all the difference. Ice bucket brought right away for the champagne  cheers to that.

I decided to do the table dhote, which comes with either salad or soup a entree and your main and dessert.

The food is out of this world. They really are good at matching what flavours blend together and not to over season or under season any of the veggies.

Started off with a mesclun salad with roasted red peppers dressing, very light but packed with flavour. It was more of a pure with oil. Very good!

Entrees were the escargot served with blue cheese on bone marrow.. so creamy and delicious must of been the best escargots I ever had. Next up was the foie gras served on a gingerbread brioche with pears. Melt in your mouth tasty. Last but not least was the Chèvre balls were awesome. Very light and packed with cheese. To die for.
The main course was the veal and it was the chefs suggestion, it was served on veggies and a beet pure. Cooked to perfection, they added nut butter on top ! 
Lamb with 2 mustard sauce was something special and very juicy and tender. Fantastic meal. Dessert was cheesecake which was  a tia Maria cake very Creamy but not to rich just right. Best meal I've had in a while
