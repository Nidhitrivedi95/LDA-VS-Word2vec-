D7CnTsm8SCmbQghz1ioPdw I chose this place for my husbands 40th Birthday dinner. We were visiting Montreal and I knew he really wanted to eat game meat while visiting this area and L'Original  came up repeatedly as the place to go. The location is on a quite alley area, the restaurant is a very woodsy chic decor. I felt that the menu was amazingly inventive, however for someone who prefers not to eat game meat you choices are limited. But in the true spirit of why we came, my husband was overwhelmed by options, bison, elk, duck, it was great to see them elevated to a higher level. 

In full disclosure this is not a cheap place, you come here and just for food you are looking at a minimum of $50pp. 

The only reason I am not giving them a 5 star review, is because the waitress was down right rude. The level of service she gave us (English speakers) vs the French speaking patrons was like night and day. It was precisely the experience of she was borderline polite to us, but chatty, flirty and animated with all of the patrons around us. It was a slightly deflating experience to what was a special night for us. 

In the end, I will say our food was excellent. The bison tartare was flavorful with the right balance of flavors. The red salad was fresh and inventive and I enjoyed the creativity of committing to a dish that was only one color but had great flavor dimension. 

The chicken dish was like comfort food, hearty and would be perfect on a cold winter night. My husband opted for the surf and turf, a bison fillet and lobster served three ways. It was an artistic plating, and he enjoyed the combination of flavors. 

I would recommend it, but hold your expectations on the level of customer service to be low, so that you are not disappointed.
