I know the executive chef at one of the other locations so it gives me a bit more insight to the chain and I am definitely a fan.

I usually like restaurants a little more unique, as this one is your typical Keg style place, but I do have to say it is good food and service.  And on the South Shore, you're at times limited to what kinds of restaurants are available...I would say this is right up there in Boucherville.
