gISrxk4A5dfrjDivkC-L-Q So lucky to have this wonderful place in my neighbourhood! I love how they greet all the customers in French, "Bonjour, ça va bien?" They have a beautiful selection of teas that come in generous pots. We had the velouté soups green and tomato with a side of their delicious bread. The crust on the loaf is perfection. We saw another customer having what looked like the best hot chocolate in the world: hot milk, cream and a small pitcher of pure melted chocolate. You mix your own to your liking. Mmm. They can do groups for all day tea platters. I want to try that next time.
