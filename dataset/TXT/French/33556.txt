hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA Bon appétit, indeed!

Every time I go here, there is always customer service that comes with a smile from everybody. They're all very welcoming and suggestive, especially for first timers! 

In the past, I have tried the croissant & egg sandwich as well as the egg baguette panini, both added turkey. 

I appreciate all of their selections because they're not too heavy, and you're not filled with a lot regret afterwards. 

Quiches were a decent breakfast as well. Eggs were fluffy and soft, but the crust was not as flaky and buttery as I had hoped. 

However, I do recommend the chocolate tart 10/10. I asked the owner, "these tarts.. are good for breakfast?" Usually I'm not open to eating dessert to start my day haha, but it was great and tart-mazing! 

They do have a wide variety of healthy and organic drinks and coffee as well. 

Would definitely come again.
