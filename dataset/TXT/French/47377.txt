O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q The dream team staff Steve, Clarence and Lantz made our experience at Morels 5+ stars. The evening started off horrible with Paul our original curt, rude waiter. We had enough sense to request a different waiter because of his horrible customer service skills. Thankfully the regional manager Kevin was there to save our evening and gave us our dream team wait staff. 

The food was amazing and our wait staff was incredibly friendly and gave us first class service. I can honestly say the fillet Mignon was the best steak I've ever eaten in my life! The mushrooms were delicious and everyone in my party was 100% satisfied with our food and service (once Paul was out of the pic). Kevin, Steve, Clarence and Lantz thank you so much for such a pleasant evening on our vacation.
