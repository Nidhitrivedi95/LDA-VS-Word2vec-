6fPQJq4f_yiq1NHn0fd11Q Wanting to get a quick breakfast in our hotel before hitting the pool, my friend and I decided to make our way downstairs to the crepe place. When we arrived, there was a line but not too unbearably long. The line however, took a deceptively long time. Once we finally got our crepes they were pretty good. My friend ordered the bananas foster crepe and I got the tomato and cheese crepe. Both of these crepes were very good.
