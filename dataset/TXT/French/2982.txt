10cjlsUzS8rAKMjdEWbxvA One of my new favourite joints in the west end. Came for a lunch meeting without any reservations. 

Ordered the Countryside Farçous: French spinach pancakes served with Montreal Smoked meat, mixed greens & potato salad 12.95 (9/10). These pancakes were Gluten free baby. Not the traditional idea of a fluffy pancake, rather more of a lightly fried spinach and egg crepe. The smoked meat served with the pancake was a bit too salty, but was easily balanced out with the fresh mixed greens and potato salad. 

My lunch companions ordered the Salads with Bivy dressing 10.75 - A generous portion of fresh greens and a balanced serving of toppings. Something I will definitely try on the next visit. 

Rating Summary: 
Food: 9/10 - Overall excellent food, meat was a tad too salty.

Atmosphere: 10/10 - Perfect spot for a lunch meeting. Modern décor, spacious, plenty of seating and music volume wasn't overbearing.  

Service: 8/10 - Water service needs improvement. Friendly staff. Quick service for a lunch hour. 

Can't wait to come back. 

Note: Bivy only takes cash or debit cards.
