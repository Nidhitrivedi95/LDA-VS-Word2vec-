oS96aJIHFWcFAlGHKKXjaw Didn't make it around the menu yet but from the taste of the two pastries I had they deserve every star available.  Choux la creme and pear tart, unbelievable pastry. Quality is very similar to Tartine in San Francisco (minus the cakes) and I'll add to this review once I try the quiche and sandwiches.  Once you've eaten around enough in your life you get an idea that this is one of those, "You can't go wrong with anything you order."
