x_1Yo9ArcbitR6NQC7tOUA Went for 1/2 price mussels night, 7$ for a large bowl of mussels and frites. They were Great! Maybe one of My favorites since coming to the city. I will make a point to come back just for these. My boyfriend had the steak, and said it was good, maybe just overpriced for what it was. 
As great as those were, the grilled romaine was terrible and flavorless though (salt please!).  The service was great, food came out quickly, and there were some other interesting items I'd look forward to trying. I'll be back... Just not for the romaine.
