eQ4Oj_kjrjVV0CfDcDWBmg Going to eat out on the west side is really a painful process nowadays. Unnecessary attitude, hipster service, road closures, lacking of parking, super expensive...

I am still looking for another joint on the east side that I can frequent. House on Parliament is definitely my number one. I have tried a few places east of the DVP, but nothing really. Il Ponte is a fine place, but it is time to look for another one. 

Many years ago, I came across a bistro in the middle of east Chinatown. However, I never had a chance to try it. Last night, I finally did. 

All the signature dishes were well executed. Specifically, the fish soup and seafood stew were excellent. 

However, I have to say that the dessert I ordered, boule de neige in English sauce (condense milk) was exceptional.
