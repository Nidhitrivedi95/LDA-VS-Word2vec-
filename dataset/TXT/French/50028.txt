The food is great quality, crafted with care and the environment has an authentic French vibe to it. The service is always fast and friendly, although they can get a little swamped on the weekends.

I love the Cheux La Creme and Chocolate Croissants, but also the Tomato Soup I had was really awesome. I would stop here every morning if I could and didn't mind packing on 100 extra lbs.
