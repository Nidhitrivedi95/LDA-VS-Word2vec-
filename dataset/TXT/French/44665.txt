mnn--vaYHtNyBNYFYBFIog Came here at 9pm on a Saturday night, ordered the tasting menu. We had a nut/seed allergy that we made them aware of and the first course and the bread both had seeds on them, but once we alerted them to the mistake they took the food back and gave us new food and gave us a different onion bread(which was refilled as fast as we ate it) and never made another mistake. The sommelier was knowledgeable and suggested a great wine, but never came by again to check on it. The food was expertly prepared, creative, and very filling - by the 5th course neither of us could finish the entire plate. The entire experience took just over 4 hours, so don't come here on a tight schedule. A special occasion, but worth it, at $300+tip with a bottle of wine
