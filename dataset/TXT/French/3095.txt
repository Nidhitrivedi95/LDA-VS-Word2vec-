Upon arriving to this Cafe there was no greeting of any kind not even a friendly smile. We stood awkwardly by the door before having to ask where we sit. We sit down and get 2 different kinds of menus. 1 is for lunch and 1 is for dinner. Before leaving, our "waitress" informs us you can't order from the dinner menu until 5. Why would they even give us this menu??  While waiting for someone to take our order, I watch the staff walking back and forth behind the counter and talking. I find one girl continuously staring at me then whispering to her co-workers which I found extremely disrespectful. After 15 minutes we wonder why no one has asked us to order. We approach the front counter and order only to be told that 1 of the meals we ordered isn't available for lunch. 
The only descent thing about this restaurant is the food. While it's nothing to smile about, it definitely doesn't make you nauseous....until about an hour later. 

Will definitely not be coming back her anytime soon.
