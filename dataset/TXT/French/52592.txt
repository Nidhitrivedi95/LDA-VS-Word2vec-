Q67n_plh27S0tlzFE7pM9g Nice atmosphere, pretty decor and very clean. Good location. Satisfactory service. Average food (my $29 pork chop was extremely dry). Very small portions and pricey for what you get. The menu does not have a lot to offer. Went in early August and their website was not updated for their monthly menu changes (Still had Sept menu posted on 8/9/16, Very disappointing). Loved the original 21/82 restaurant, had high hopes when I saw the Grand Reopening. I really wanted to love this place. Disappointing to say the least. Don't think I'll go back to give it another try. There are so many other great places to eat in Cleveland's suburbs.
