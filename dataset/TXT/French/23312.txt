C3PVq7UpeHd6nz1_e-AtkA Great little joint in Little Italy to hang out with friends without breaking the bank. Loved the environment and patio. Great way to spend a lazy weekday afternoon catching up with friends. 

The food was decent, but nothing spetacualr. 5 of us shared the hummus plate for appetizer. Most of us got the scrolls for main course. I think Scroll 3 would be my favourite.  My friend got the salmon quiche, which was quit delicious.

The only set back from our experience was the discovery of a giant bug in my friend's water cup. Very gross.  For that reason alone, I may not go back.
