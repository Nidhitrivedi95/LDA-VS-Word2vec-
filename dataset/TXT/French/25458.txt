Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA Had dinner here last night with a few co-workers.  I started with the (duck) foie gras and then had the bison tenderloin and a quince tart for dessert with some lovely sorbet.  

All in all, it was a good meal, the view was great, the wine was good and the atmosphere is a welcome retreat from the noise and flash of the strip.  Yet, somehow, it didn't all add up to a spectacular meal - it was a very good meal, but for whatever reason, this isn't the type of experience that makes me want to bring my wife here the next time we're in Vegas.

Let me be clear, you will have a good meal here.  You probably won't make memories here, however.  What's the english translation for Je ne sais quoi?  Whatever it is, this place is missing that.
