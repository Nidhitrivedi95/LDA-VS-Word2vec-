SJo_IjvzdRtCvZVN0cbrRQ Food is GREAT here !!! Prices are more than your average breakfast, but so are the flavors, style, and quality of food. Most everything is fresh, local, and baked goods are made in house. I personally never had poor service in my more than three times visiting, but I have seen some servers be less than attentive to patrons. The cafe does get filled up at peak hours and you can expect to wait sometimes for a seat, but it is usually always worth it. This would be my preferred breakfast stop everyday if I could afford it.
