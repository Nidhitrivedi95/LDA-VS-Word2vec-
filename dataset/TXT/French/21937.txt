bMiyGPaMqF0svjseW1UR_g A standard bistro pub. Quite loud, frenetic atmosphere. Nice menu with good selection as well as daily specials. The chicken breast with maple glaze was delicious and beautifully presented with roasted seasonal vegetables-highly recommended. The pulled pork was OK, maybe not a good choice for a BBQ loving Yank. The burger was good, nicely presented with salad and hand cut style skinny fries. The Sangria  Blanche is refreshing and tasty. The service was attentive, friendly and competent. If possible, call ahead and secure a sidewalk table on a lovely night-tres bon!
