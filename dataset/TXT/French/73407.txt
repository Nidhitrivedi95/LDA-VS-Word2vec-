xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g review of a la carte, and sans dessert, and review of child friendliness

first, it was difficult to find the entrance to the restaurant. there should be a more obvious route.

odd to enter at the kitchen. but interesting.

not child friendly in that they can't do pasta or rice.
not child friendly in that I purposely cut up my kid's chicken for to go and they left that part of the to go out! they also left the french fries out of the to go!

free cheese puff - but had rye in it (I hate rye!)
3 bread options- rustic, french and mixed wheat, though not warm but soft.
tomatoe salad was good!
beef wellington was ok
husband got fish- great presentation, but small portion

the bellagio fountains were nice, but couldn't see it unless you had the next to the glass seats, and felt like they were stealing from Bellagio.
=)

crazy expensive!  $20 for tomatoe salad??

service was off on Sunday PM. didn't give us spoons for the soup. didn't notice guest didn't have fork to eat dish.

had to ask for to go twice! told them we were on a time crunch and they didn't help us get out on time/remind us. though they did get us the food on time.
