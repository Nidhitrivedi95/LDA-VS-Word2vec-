0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g Oh how I want to give 5 stars. Had I not had dessert, it would have been five. 

Ambiance is about as perfect as it can get in Vegas, love the view of the fountains. Staff and service exhibit perfection.

To date, probably the best meal experience ever. And their foie gras will ruin your expectations for any restaurant not up to this caliber. My husband will hardly order it anywhere now because he knows it won't be as good.

Dessert was very good, but not the best I've ever had and not the best way to end an otherwise exceptional meal.
