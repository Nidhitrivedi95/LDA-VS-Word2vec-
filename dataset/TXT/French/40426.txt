KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA Marché Bacchus is one of the best French restaurants in Vegas. Overlooking a beautiful lake scene, the restaurant has many dining options, all of them phenomenal. Service was amazing; our waiters would were very experienced, well-versed, kind, helpful, and attentive. Their wine selection was extensive and exquisite. The Braised Beef was delicious, juicy and tender, and had a side of mashed potatoes that were out of this world. The pork porterhouse had a very tasty sear and sauce, but the cut of meat was grisly and tough in some places. The polenta dish was unbelievable; it is on the vegetarian menu but tasted hearty, buttery, and fabulous. The French onion soup was the best I have had in Las Vegas, and the Ahi Tuna Poke was also phenomenal. Unfortunately, the desserts were not as pleasing. The tiramisu was a little dry, and the bread pudding was a bit underdone. Overall, the French meal and feel offered at Marché Bacchus is highly superior as well as enjoyable.
