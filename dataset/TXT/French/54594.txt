In a hoity toity hotel and a high end restaurant, this is quite hard to come by. The service was excellent and, for a family of four dressed in casual wear, we were treated no different than the business suits sitting a table next to us.

The highlights include the baguette with salted butter that our family ate with joy. Yes its complimentary but its darn good too.

We ordered the poutine, the beef tartare, and three different tartines. Everything was good, but my favorite was the beef tartine. Reduced in red wine and served on a crispy tartine, they crack a hella fresh egg in top and what you get is pure awesomeness.

I don't get the opportunity to eat at an establishment like this, but when im glad that my experience here was a good one.
