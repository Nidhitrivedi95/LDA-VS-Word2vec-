m9aFZk1f8tSv248YErbpQA Tried this place for the first time today. WOW. walked in and it looked very small but comfortable as soon as we walked in we were welcomed and told to sit where ever we'd like. We were promptly green with waters and asked what we'd like. We each got crepes. Mine has fresh mozzarella, tomatoes, and prosciutto with a balsamic drizzle. Oh my god this was to die for. My boyfriend got a chicken and mushroom crepe which he said was amazing. Food took a little longer to come out than expected but we didn't mind. The owner came over and apologized for the wait which was very nice. Once we go to pay out bill they gave us a chocolate filled croissant. Which was by far the best I ever had. This is  a great little restaurant with a great family feel. We will for sure go back.
