xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g Had dinner at the Eiffel Tower Restaurant in March 2015. Food was fantastic and the staff were very friendly. We had a later reservation and had incredible views of the Bellagio fountains - which ran every 15 or 20 minutes. Prices are pretty expensive but the food and ambiance are high quality and it makes for the perfect romantic date night while vacationing in Vegas.
