ZrHU8ZzwZQjTRpB1K_8JTQ Went early on a Friday night (5:45pm-ish) and got right in.  They seated us in the upstairs dining room, which is GORGEOUS!!  This place has so much character.  There's not much on the first floor, except a few tables and a cute and cozy little bar (which I probably could've sat at all night).
The service was quick and excellent.  I had the crusted walleye, which was outstanding.  It came with green beans (accompanied by some very tasty bacon pieces).  My date had the fish fry, which he thought was really good as well.  Will definitely be trying this place again.  It just has such a cool ambience!
