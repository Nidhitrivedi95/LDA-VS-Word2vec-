4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Had breakfast here. Ordered the special lamb eggs benedict. Husband ordered steaks & eggs. Also ordered side of warm baguette. 

Why 4 and not 5 stars. 

Food - lamb eggs benedict was good. I liked it a lot. Bread was served warm. Deal breaker? The steak & eggs. Hashbrown was burnt & the steak had excessive pepper. It was overpowering that you could barely enjoy the steak anymore. I guess expected more for the price. 

Other than that, everything else was perfect.
