SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA Best was the French onion soup. Bold flavor with melty gooey cheese. One of the best onion soups. One criticism is that it was a tad over salted. A cup was just enough to leave us craving more

The mussels were fresh and flavorful and pomme frites crispy. The delicious sauce was great for dipping anything. 

Pork 2 ways: a miss. Pork belly was fatty and should have been rendered longer. The shank was overcooked and dry. The cauliflower, while crispy, was bland. 

Took a risk with the "frozen grand marnier soufflé."  While we were warned not to expect a warm soufflé, but a cold dessert, it was completely unexpected to have watery vanilla sauce that resembled nothing of a soufflé in taste or texture. It was neither smooth nor fluffy, and unfortunately not frozen either. It tasted more like ice cream left at room temperature to melt and then served; then someone must have took a swig of our grand marnier because the flavor was nowhere in our dessert. It was only suitable in the coffee as a substitute creamer.
