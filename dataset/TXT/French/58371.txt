rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A My wife and I ate here for our first morning of a four day stay in Vegas.  The weekend brunch was so exquisite we came back each day for breakfast.  Anyone who gives this place less than five stars is doing it simply to deny Mr. Keller the praise he deserves.  This restaurant is impeccable -- the food, service, and ambience are second to none.  I would list each of the items we tried, however, even the Roget's will run out of superlatives to describe the food. In my humble opinion,Bouchon served the finest meal I've ever eaten before noon.
