O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q We had a party of 11. They seated us in a private room with one other table. It was very nice. We sat by the window, so you can see the busy streets of vegas. 

The food is quite good. I had halibut, and it was very yummy!!! The salmon was good as well. Most of the guys had steak, but i am not a big steak eater, so can't speak about the steak there. 

The waiter was very nice. He also give us a story about the expensive chandelier.
