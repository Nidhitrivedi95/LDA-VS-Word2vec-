0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g Picasso's was excellent. Nicely priced for a 2 Michelin star restaurant we enjoyed the 5 course tasting menu with matching wines.  Highlights of the meal were the oysters poached in vermouth with Osetra caviar and the seared foie gras with lemon pound cake.  The walls are filled with Picasso's paintings and are lovely to look at while dining or face the Bellagio fountains which are beautiful at night. Chef Julian Serrano is wonderful to talk to and almost always in the kitchen cooking which is a rarity these days.
