RZk_PE-H9SygqwSQd88cWQ I ate at this restaurant this past weekend and would highly recommend it. It was the most authentic French bistro food I have had outside of Paris. Plus excellent, personalized service.  Nothing fancy, but if you are looking for good, relatively inexpensive, French food in a non-intimidating friendly setting this is your place! 

Try the steak frites!
