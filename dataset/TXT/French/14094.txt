58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw This is our long-standing first choice for a brunch with great value. By value, I mean the quality for the price. Yes, there are fancier brunches to be had, but when we're hungry and don't want to take any chances, Le Cartet is it. My husband gets the "des Cantons" brunch and I get the "Sante" brunch. The fresh OJ is much better in the warm months -- it's a bit too tart in the cold months. Usually there's lots of fresh fruit, but they didn't include that when we went in December 2013 -- why? :(. I also like to pick up some chocolate from their huge selection when we check out. We know when to arrive so we don't have to wait in a queue (before 11), and they generally have enough wait staff that service is good. When I worked in downtown Montreal, I often had lunch here or bought a to-go lunch and dessert. We like the spacious high ceilings and the basic decor. One reviewer from TO said it was sooooo passe, but having lived in Montreal for 7 years, and for 30+ years in the US, and some years in TO, I've seen that nothing is more fickle and silly than the Toronto foodie scene. Honestly, any place that would welcome Momofuku like it was the hottest thing ever is plain daft. Anyway, I can testify that Le Cartet has been solid and inviting for at least a decade, and is more inviting since the remodel. I hope it stays that way for another decade. because we'll continue to make it our destination.
