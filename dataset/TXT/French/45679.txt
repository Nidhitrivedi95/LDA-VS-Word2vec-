mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q Overall a great dining experience.

Multi-course tasting menu with vegetarian option.  Vary accommodating to dietary restrictions.  Wine pairing available.

Ambiance:  Jazz music, red/black interior, comfortable seating, quiet noise level.  It's just off the gaming floor - so not really a white linen experience - more modern with a large dining bar that overlooks the open kitchen.  Tables to the side.

Service:  Attentive.  There are many options - tasting or ala carte.  Expensive food and wine alternatives.  I will say the waiter was very hard to understand, however, the service was good.

Wine:  Great wine selection at fairly high prices - as expected.  Solid recommendations.

Food:  This is what it's all about - excellent food and very accommodating to altering the tasting menu for like/dislikes.  We left full, but not stuffed.

Parking:  In the MGM lot for $10.  After dining and paying a small fortune they should validate.  

Prices:  Eke - expect to spend and arm and a leg - but maybe once a year or once in a lifetime.
