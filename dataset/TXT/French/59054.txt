The decor was charmingly romantic with soft pastel circus murals on the walls.  Even the whimsical dinnerware was unique and interesting.  And the food was simply wonderful.  Our meal began with a peanut soup which was followed by escargot that were tender and perfectly seasoned.  We selected breads , warm and flavorful,  from a tray brought to our table often.  Our entree of Sea Bass with potato crust was amazing.   I had a Grand Marnier soufflé and my husband had the banana soufflé.  The were puffy and light and tasted heavenly.   Every course was served with perfect timing so that there were no delays in the meal.  Finally we enjoyed a plate of small chocolates and were even given a tiny box with two truffles to take with us.  If you want a really special dinner try Le Cirque.
