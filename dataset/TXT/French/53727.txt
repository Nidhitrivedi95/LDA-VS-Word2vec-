qmh6zxtJ8C8-YiUPv7ySlw Sitting on the terrace of the restaurant is great except for that crazy light show they have at the Wynn, it is so out of place.  The DB Burger is definitely interesting to have once but I probably will never order it again - didn't really taste the short ribs and the foie was overcooked and definitely didn't taste truffles.  The fries were really good though.  The pork chop though was super yummy.  BF said the bed of lentils was a bit salty but still the pork chop dish was yummy.  Beet salad was good and the pate was not bad also.  The hazelnut parfait dessert was okay only.  Overall not a bad meal but nothing spectacular.  It's probably more like 3.5 stars.
