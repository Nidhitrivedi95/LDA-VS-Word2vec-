3FlWR_osNPb8dcqLgHebHw This place is nothing more than an Applebee's, or maybe an IHOP, for the blue-hair crowd.
Despite very friendly hosts and some of the best, most attentive waiters in town, Mimi's chow will only disappoint you.
We tried a variety of dishes here, from the crab cakes to the pancake breakfast and were thoroughly disappointed.
The place makes a homespun, middle-America attempt at showcasing itself as a neighborhood French bistro, but even the worst hole in the wall in New Orleans or Paris outshines the food here - just further proof that substance will win out over style any day of the week.
The pancakes are gummy, the protein dishes are waaaay over-sauced and I swear to God, I felt sick to my stomach for a full three hours after the last time we went here.
And it's a shame, too, because Mimi's is staffed by a TON of great folks. Yet even the friendliest, most efficient wait staff can't make up for the truly sub-par preparation of the food.
We had expected so much more from this place, but there's just no way I can recommend it. 
On the plus side, the food is very affordable, but after my three-hour bout of nausea I can see why. 
That said, the place is clean, very clean. So it's not a question of sanitation.
It's a question of management not hiring cooks who know how to deliver tasty food.
Sorry, Mimi's, but we'll be saying "au revoir" to you.
