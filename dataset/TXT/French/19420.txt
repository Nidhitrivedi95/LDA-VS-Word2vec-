aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw If you're a fan of desserts, you have to stop by this place if you're in LV. My girlfriends and I went there on Saturday and I only got one vanilla because I usually don't like macarons; however, I loved it so much I had to go back the next day to try all of them. My favorites were the vanilla and chocolate but all of them were really good. (I got the pack of chocolate, coffee, vanilla, strawberry, pistachio, lemon) They were so light, a little crispy but the inside was really soft. OMG so good, especially when it was chilled; I want to go back now :[

FYI: It's inside the Venetian but it's kind of hard to find. It's actually under the escalators where Phantom is showing.
