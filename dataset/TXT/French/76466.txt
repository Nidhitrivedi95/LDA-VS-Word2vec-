Yp9w4nhUowBU_IS_StFXbQ If you want to eat in the sunshine, in January - be sure you're done eating by 1pm.  The sun slipped behind the hotel just a few minutes after we arrived (booo)

We came here during brunch but really were not happy with that menu.  After pleading our case, the server came back from the kitchen with the usual menu.    The service was ok.  I asked the hostess if she could put together a small toiletries bag for my mom, the birthday girl - and she said no.  Who would say no?   Isnt this Las Vegas???

There were maybe 1/4 of the tables full inside and out. 

All my mom really wanted for her birthday was a nice steak.  What we ended up with was some tough stripp steak.   My mom and I both just wanted simply a steak, veggies and potatoes.  While it looked great - it did not meet our expetations.  The potato cakes were all right, seems that they come in frozen, seriously. 

They serve a nice yeast roll here, but they put it in a popover pan which is totally unattractive.  I'd rather a roll on a plate in this case.

The orange frenchtoast with macadamia butter was acceptable.

All in all, there were some scallops on the menu I think I would rather have had and I dont even like scallops.  Regardless of what we did or didnt order, no matter what menu we used - EVERYONE in the kitchen should be able to pick a steak.

Our steaks differed by about 3oz between mine and my momma's.
