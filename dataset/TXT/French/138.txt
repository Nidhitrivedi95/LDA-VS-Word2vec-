-4TMQnQJW1yd6NqGRDvAeA I just wasn't feeling it here.  Maybe I've been spoiled by all of the great restaurants in New Orleans lately.  I'm not sure, but The House Brasserie was a disappointment.  It wasn't bad.  It was better than average.  It just didn't meet the expectation build up.

- The service was good, although if the female server touched me one more time, my wife (on Valentine's Day no less) was going to throw down.

- The space was amazing.  Very cool.  Urban gothic.

- Waiting in the parking lot kind of sucked.

- The charcuterie was a la carte, which bummed me out.  I wanted a traditional charcuterie board with the chef selecting what and how much we receive based on our party size.  The salumi was ok.  The smoked burrata was bad (and I love burrata).  The goat cheese was amazing.

- The chef's prepared seared foie gras was good, but the preparation didn't bring out the best in it.  I'm not sure large slices of corn go with fatty duck liver.

- For my main, I got the veal chop.  Medium rare.  It was overcooked at well.  Not a shred of pink or tenderness.  The crust that wasn't burnt was good, but seriously, dry veal is terrible.

- My wife had the short ribs and mashed potatoes.  It was excellent.  Tender and flavorful.
