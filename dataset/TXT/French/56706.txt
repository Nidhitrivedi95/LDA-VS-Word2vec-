rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A This was my second time dining here.  I have been here in the past for dinner and was not impressed.  But I like the brunch a lot!

My bf and I arrived at 12:30pm on a Sunday (during the 4th of July weekend).  Too bad they don't allow reservation for the weekend brunches, we waited for about 40 minutes to be seated.  

We ordered:

Chicken & Waffles - It was amazing!  The chicken was done perfectly, tender and juicy!  The waffles?  TWO THUMBS UP!   

Omelette of the day - The omelette was just OK, Good but nothing special.

The biggest stand out for me was the house bread.  Haha....yup, the bread was so GOOD, especially the raspberry jam and butter.  VERY GOOD COMBINATION!

Service was good but kinda slow.  We waited for about 30 minutes for our food to come out........It was not a very good idea to wait that long especially when you were sitting outside during the day!

Overall, I still love Bouchon.  I will definitely come back when I visit Vegas again!
