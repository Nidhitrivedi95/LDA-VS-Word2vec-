ZdaZwXC0FByDY3EwNELphw Union was one of my favorite dinners recently for a variety of reasons. Most importantly, the food was terrific. Fresh, local ingredients, interesting options, healthy portions and terrific execution all came together for a perfect experience. Informal décor, cool vibe and really awesome front and back bars.

Our starters included the fried smelts, a wild mushroom tartiniette, and a local apple and cheese salad. The smelts were crispy and delicious, paired with an amazing dill cream sauce and salad. The apple and cheese salad was fresh, vibrant and a perfect balance of sweet and savory. The true standout for me was the tartinette. Sautéed wild mushrooms over a fresh, molasses brown bread with a garlic butter sauce. Rich, layered and satisfying - it's something I hope to see on the menu for future visits.

For my main I opted for the smoked pork and beef lasagna. I was a little apprehensive but it was viscerally satisfying. It arrived to the table still bubbling in a hot ramekin swimming in tomato sauce, dripping with cheese and piled with fresh basil. A phenomenal contemporary take on an Italian classic.
