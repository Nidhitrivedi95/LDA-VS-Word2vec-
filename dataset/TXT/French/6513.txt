4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw This place was wonderful!! Came here with a group of 11 girls and we were running late which can easily spell disaster for a group with a schedule.  So, on a busy Saturday night we feared that we wouldn't be seated, let alone get quick enough service to allow us to keep to our schedule.  Thankfully, they were able to accommodate us! They seated us within about 10 minutes of arriving and our waitress (I feel terrible that I forgot her name) accommodated our every request!! She got us our food quickly, efficiently, and perfectly. She definitely deserved a five star rating on her own!! And the food...it was delicious!! Everyone was happy with their meal (a rare feat).  I ordered the steak...so juicy, tender and tasty!! I loved this place! Totally worth the price (which was reasonable in my opinion).  Great for groups ( also so rare!) based on our experience.
