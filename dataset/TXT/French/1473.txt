_T7f2wUgNlJqxsR-cR89SQ Scaramouche continues to be our "go-to" restaurant for the annual anniversary dinner.
I would rank as a 4.5 but trending high -- hence the 5 star rating.

The service here is always wonderful.  Best in the city (IMHO).

What we ate:
- Colville oysters and the grilled octopus salad to start
- the duck breast (with mushroom and foie gras stuffing) and the filet mignon as mains
- the coconut cream pie and the Valrhona chocolate mousse

The appetizers and mains were fantastic.  
For me their coconut cream pie is "da bomb", but I have to say that the Valrhona mousse by comparison looked tiny.  My husband said it was good, but that he needed a magnifying glass to see it (joking of course) -- and since the coconut cream pie is a generous offering -- well I shared!  :)

Service was wonderful, and they gave us a table by the window as requested.
Thanks to the management for a wonderful meal!

Note: all parking is Valet, but there is no additional fee to park (other than please tip those valet attendants!).
