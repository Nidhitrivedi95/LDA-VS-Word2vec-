0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g one of the best restaurants on the strip....  this is the third time my husband and i visited the restaurant since we tried it last year.  
not only is the food excellent, the ambience and the fountain view is amazing.  
not to mention the picasso art work all over the walls.  
the staff are very attentive and accomodating. 
we both had the degustation menu and as always, superb!!
