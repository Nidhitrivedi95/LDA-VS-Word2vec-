w1BbvLeKBSKBnlALLhPmGg I'm very much in love with this place. Unfortunately I've yet to stay here but being a fan of it's sister in Glasgow (well the bar anyway) I was keen to check this place out. It didn't disappointed. When some friends and I stopped by for a couple of drinks and nibbles, we ended up staying most of the evening. The decor is very lavish and fun. The service is excellent and the food- yummy.
