gCbS0X8w7vZ9CLWvMNXocA Good ambiance. Small restaurant located upstairs of Yorkville. I thought it was kind of pricey for normal French food. They also ran out of the rabbit when I was there. Lots of omelets on the menu for some reason. Wine was surprisingly bad @ this French restaurant. Service was great thought.
