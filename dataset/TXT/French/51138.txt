p2OvNFiFKnRoWSRON4-lcA Totally in love with this place! We had a warm welcome, and easy to make reservations. Locally owned restaurants are a gem when you find a place like this. Very gluten free friendly. The food is high quality, and with service to match. I had the escargot, and rabbit for the first time and loved it. I recommend you stop by this charming delightful place. It was worth every penny.
