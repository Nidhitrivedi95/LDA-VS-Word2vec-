Called the day before spoke with the Manager who told us to come in with our party of 15 and they would make sure we sat together.  Showed up waited for all 15 people to make it, when they did not show we ask for a table for 10.  They split us into two booths.  The whole idea was a get together.

The managers response was "what do you want me to do", nuff said.  When a manager of a restaurant says that the other obvious problems become much worse.  The 4 hostesses never smiled welcomed us or said goodbye or thank you.  The waiter had a lon gotee that everyone was afraid would fall in our food.  He never smiled and never said thankyou.

If semi-good food with real bad service is what you want I recommend this restaurant.  The owner needs to hire workers that smile and thank the customer who pays their wages.
