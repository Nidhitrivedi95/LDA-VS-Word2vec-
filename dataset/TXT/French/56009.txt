rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I spend all too much time at the Venetian each year. This is my first stop after I check in and unpack my bags. 
Early evening cocktail paired with the Rillettes aux Deux Saumons is a perfect start to a long trip. 
Savory and sweet options available for brunch with delicious coffee. 
When the weather is right, the outdoor patio is lovely.
