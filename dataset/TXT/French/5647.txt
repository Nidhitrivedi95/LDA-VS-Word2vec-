3jKUbhGSjFTv5jZ0wnW0xA Perhaps the best dinner we had while in Montreal and it was on the last day.

Started the meal with the foie gras terrine served over toasted country bread.  This was good but I think the foie gras that I had at Animal in LA was much better.  Probably wouldn't order this if I came back to Montreal.  We also tried the french onion soup.  I loved it.  It had a little sweet taste to it.  There was the perfect amount of onions and the cheese was perfectly melted on top.  Delicious!  For the main meal my girlfriend and I split the filet mignon with potatoes forestière and foie gras sauce.  This was awesome.  It is a very heavy dish with steak, potatoes, pearl onions and nice cuts of sliced bacon.  I scarfed the whole thing down while my girlfriend watched because she had was so full.  

The restaurant staff is great.  They are very attentive and took care of the clientele that was eating at the restaurant from my observations.  

At the end of the meal they even brought out a shot for my lady and I.  It was some schnapps (probably apple).  Thank you for the kind gesture.  

And by the end of the meal the locals were playing in the fountain that was across from the restaurant.  Someone had thrown some bubbles in and the fountain had turned into a bubble extravaganza.  Awesome!!

I am sure that this restaurant does well since it was packed outside and it was almost 10:30pm at night on a warm summer Sunday evening.

Cheers!
