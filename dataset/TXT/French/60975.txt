SFnrHuVFSNiondFVUBLJZQ This was my first time trying savory crepes.  I didn't know what to expect, but the crêpe that I ordered was delicious.  I also ordered a side salad which had a maple vinaigrette salad dressing.  I wasn't expecting this weakness of the dressing, but it was an amazing surprise.  I scarfed down the salad before even thinking about eating the crepe.  When I decided to dig into the crepe, The flavors of the ham, cheese, spinach, and bechamel sauce mixed with the sweetness of the crepe danced on my taste buds.  This place is worth a visit.  My only regret is that I was too full to try the sweet crepe.
