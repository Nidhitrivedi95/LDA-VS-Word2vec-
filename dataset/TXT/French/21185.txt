B56AYe5GNuavMDtwFsXqzA My mom, my sisters and I came to Petite Maison last night for dinner after a day of work. It's such a cute little place, and rings true to the style of so many restaurants I visited while living in France. It got a little confusing with our server however, who left us with another server for a little while, and then came back at the end of the meal. 

We started out with a cheese plate and an order of escargot, which was a perfect appetizer...just enough to get the taste buds going but not too much to make you feel full already. Next we all passed around the salade maison, as well as the salad special and a bowl of french onion soup. The salade maison was good, however I felt that the chevre lacked its typical flavor and was somewhat bland instead. On the flip side, both the onion soup and the salad special were phenonimal. 

My mom and my sister had the fish for two, which was a full Loup de Mer with potatoes and haricots verts. Both of them said it was fantastic, especially the meat from under the gills. I had the pork tenderloin with leeks, brussel sprouts and apple cider reduction...it was absolutely delicious. They cook the pork medium, so there is still a tad of pink and its nice and juicy. I have the other half of the meal in my fridge and cannot wait to have that again! My twin sister got the roasted chicken with oyster stuffing and truffles and was not dissappointed in the least. For dessert we shared the chocolate creme brulee, which if the name itself doesnt give away its heavenly nature, the taste certainly will.
