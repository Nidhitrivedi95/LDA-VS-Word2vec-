cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg A very inappropriate place to keep a diet!  But oh so good!  We just watched a PBS show in our hotel before departing for APDC that said that fatty food was actually good for you!  Perfect timing!

Since it was our first time, one of us had to have the Duck in a Can and while a little pricey compared to other dishes, it was excellent!  Amazed they got that much duck breast and froie gras in a tin can and cooked perfectly rare for duck.  I could not finish all.  Kept the can too, don't know why but I did.

We actually started with the fried froie gras and it was excellent and melted in mouth as our server said....wait one minute before popping the cube - one bite does it...only $3.50...a must.

Then we had the Terrine of Froie Gras with a toasted baguette and every last molecule of froie gras was consumed since it's a banned substance in California!

Our other entree was the Veal with gnocchi - fall off the bone tender and tasty!

No room for dessert.

Don't eat anything heavy or for 10 hours before your meal, this will allow you to enjoy one more dish maybe.
