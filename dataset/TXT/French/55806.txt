rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Beautiful restaurant on the second floor of the Venetian with separate elegant dining rooms.

- Like the various assortment of pastries (cheese danish,  doughnuts, etc) but dangerous as you end up filling up on these.

- Terrine de foie gras de canard - served in a jar with toasted baguette slices.  RIch, creamy and delicious but also quite pricey at ~$50.

- Corned beef hash w/ eggs - hearty and very filling.  Good quality meat.

Nice, classy way to start the day.
