Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA We went to MIX for our wedding anniversary dinner after watching Lion King. The timing can't be more perfect if you can catch the 4pm Lion King and start dinner at MIX by about 7pm.  The view of this restaurant is absolutely breath-taking. It'd be nice if the weather is warmer so you can dine outside. We sat by the window and had a fantastic view. The staff and our server were all nice.  They, for some reason, all spoke with a weird accent. It is difficult to understand at times as if I am in a different country. Oh well, we ordered a pumpkin soup, scallops, cod, mac&cheese side, and chocolate souffle. I liked everything but the scallops. It is a little too salty and the scallops are rubbery (it's kinda my fault to have them cook the scallops well), but they still shouldn't be so salty.  The Cod was cooked really well and well-seasoned. Mac & cheese is rich and creamy! Overall, we like the food and the service. Just the view itself well worth the money.
