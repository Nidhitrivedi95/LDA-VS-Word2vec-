xcmmTXhuMx2fZF2Bt69F4w I had brunch here last Sunday and I brunch fairly often. In fact, I'm part of a brunch club. I have to say this was definitely one of the best brunches I have had in Pittsburgh in a very long time. The food was awesome an the service was great. The only downside is they do not take reservations so we had to arrive 30 minutes before opening and wait in line, but totally worth it.
