kcF-en40P3J9L8nLy5lKqQ Egg's Benedict were incredible.  We went for brunch, need to back and try their dinner or lunch service.  It's definitely the party brunch spot with live music and bottomless drinks.  I prefer a more mellow brunch but would go back for the Egg's Benedict alone.  They are getting lots of breakfast competition on that corner though but maybe that will help with getting a reservation. They give first timers cookies and cream, always a nice touch!
