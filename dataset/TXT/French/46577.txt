nKeGPmH5dYNVL5AyAItuKg A very small restaurant serving somewhat French food with some Asian features. Both their chicken and beef dishes were solid yet uninspired. 
Seating is limited and reservations are a must. Not really an intimate meal ambiance. A narrow cocktail list with approachable price points and flavour. 
Enjoy Toronto!
