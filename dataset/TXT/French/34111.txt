hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA I'm going to start finding excuses to hang out in Spring Valley so I don't feel bad driving across town for a meal. Wow, what a variety! My sister and I visited the cafe after an afternoon of hiking and didn't want to completely counteract the work we just put in, sharing two paninis did just the trick! We split the Grilled Eggplant and Chipotle Chicken; both incredible! Swapping halves was a great idea; we were able to try two menu items AND going back and forth from sandwich to sandwich was like tasting it for the first time again!! 
The upbeat, personable owner and employees had me thinking the place just opened.. nope, they're really that great! Overall, the place has a unique menu with great prices and a friendly atmosphere! Be sure to bring a friend so you can mooch off each other's food.
