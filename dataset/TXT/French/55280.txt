rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Zero stars for value, and 4 stars for service. We had a great server and although the food is tasty, it just isn't up to par enough for the cost. $37 dollars for breakfast (pre tax and tip) got us coffee, fruit, a danish, and a bowl of luke warm oatmeal. The danish was out of this world, but $8 bucks for a skimpy plate of fruit??

We choose to eat here soley based on the location given that we were in a hurry to meet a group of friends at their neighboring hotel for departure on an ATV ecursion.  This was probably the most regrettable meal of my Las Vegas trip.  However, I guess that's what I get for choosing to eat in our hotel out of convenience.
