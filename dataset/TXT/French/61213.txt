Creperie Chez Suzette is a two-storey building with a patio located in the central tourist area in Old Montreal. It serves a large selection of crepes and fondue. 

At my visit, I had the French crepe with stuffed ham, Brie and caramelized onions served with 100% pure Quebec maple syrup. It was delicious! It was hands down the best crepe I have ever had.

I would highly recommend this place to all! If you're looking for a local authentic meal, this is it!
