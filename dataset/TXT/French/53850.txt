qnFdBp12seAxwe2_iHM2bA Fantastic restaurant. Highly recommend. I'll start by saying that the service was wonderful. Starting with the host, I asked as we got in where there was a pharmacy. seeing that we were out of town, he walked out in 0 degree weather and actually showed us where it was, and said he'd hold out table. The waitress as well was super knowledgeable and nice, patient with my millions of questions. Exceptional service. 

The food was phenomenal. The dishes were innovative, and executed almost perfectly. The fois gras was sensational, the "princess scallops" were fantastic and beautiful, and the sea scallop entree was great. The only thing that wasn't quite up to total perfection was the steak tartare. It was excellent and creative, but for me, a bit too creative. I don't like when people add cream, and there was this bizarre extra crunchy thing thrown in...I just think there was too much going on. I prefer my steak tartare to be a bit simpler. Then we ended the meal with literally the best profiteroles I've ever had. - I think they blow torched se sugar on the top of the cream puffs to add that creme brûlée burnt caramel flavor and it was beautiful. Definitely go!

I would honestly give it a 4.75 stars (bc of the steak). So I rounded up.
