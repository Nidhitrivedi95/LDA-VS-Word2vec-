Group of friends decided to try somewhere classier and we ended up at Bouchon. 
We had reservation for 530pm and the place was quite empty when we in. There were plenty of meat dishes to choose from, yet I was feeling more adventurous and decided on the monk fish with lobster sauce. 

The monk fish by itself didn't have much flavor, but dipping it in lobster sauce makes it go from okay to amazing. It fills you up and leaves you craving for more. Be warned, one of my friends had the steak and fries and there is simply too much fries.

The service is something you would expect from such a highly rated restaurant. The food is quite pricey, but certainly worth the dining experience.
