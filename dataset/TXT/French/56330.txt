rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Nice. Did not come in hungry. Too bad. Nice menu selection. The escargot with the light pastry topping was delicious. Almond peach torte with almond ice cream reminded me of my youth!  Delicious. Coffee excellent service wonderful. Setting beautiful. Warm pistachios and bread are served when seated. Look forward to another visit!
