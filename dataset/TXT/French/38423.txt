jfOyDJ-W4lV47Y61pPcMfQ My girlfriend and I went there for our anniversary and this place was the perfect spot for us. Being young- I loved the BYO Wine policy as we could drink and have a good time without draining our pockets. The ambiance was very nice and that of a modern yet classy french restaurant. The 4 course meals were simply delicious and for once I felt like I was immersed in the taste. I felt like I was transported back to eating in a french restaurant Toulouse. Total for me and my girlfriend was under $100, for an amazing laid back experience with great experience. I would recommend everyone to try it out.
