gh6__q2WXFuyN8gt6VAnWw The food was really good, but the service was very disappointing. We attended the Argentine Tango dance night, so the restaurant was pretty crowded. However, the restaurant only had 1 waitress (who did a good job) for the whole restaurant, but she was the only one, so it took us at least a half hour to get our check, I had to ask twice. Plus they charged us automatic gratuity, so there was little incentive for them to be expedient with their service. Hopefully the service will get better, because the food was pretty good, and the dance event was very nice.
