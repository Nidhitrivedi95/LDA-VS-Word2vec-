oPGUbqBpHNZvVu9gAFJbMQ I've been impressed with Montreal cuisine and Chez Delmo hits a high note in classic french seafood.  The restaurant is close to the Notre Dame Basillica but still in a quiet location. The ambiance is refined and classic but comfortable. Jackets would not be out of the ordinary but clearly not required.  The staff was friendly and knowledgeable about the dishes.  I chose the halibut, my wife had the mussels with oysters, and our oldest child had the filet migon.  The halibut was buttery smooth with a delicately crispy crust - wonderful.  My wife said the oysters were the best she has had - all locally sourced.  The steak was great.  I was impressed that they used a more fatty cut of filet.  A must do for Montreal.
