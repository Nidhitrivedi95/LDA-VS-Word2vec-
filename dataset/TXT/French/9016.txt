4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw After seeing the 8:00pm show of Absinthe nearby, Minh, and I were trying to decide what to have for dinner. We did not feel like having any of the usual that we tend to have while we are in town. Looking for something that sounded different and yet filling we came across this gem of a place to eat!
The reviews were excellent and their menu selection was vast!

Located inside of the Paris hotel, the wait was not too long for the two of us wanting to sit outside on the strip!

Our table was perfect for us, we had a great view of the Bellagio Fountains, and it boasted great people watching too!

Our server was sweet as pie, after we settled in, our water was poured and we were asked what we would like to drink. We ordered a couple of glasses of their Frangria. Which I highly recommend! 

Next, our server brought out a piping hot baguette along with some butter and pickled carrots. 

The server gave us plenty of time to look over their menu and answered any questions that we might have!

I decided on getting:

Roast Chicken and Frites - half chicken, bacon, mushrooms, pearl onions, and a side of whipped cauliflower.

The roasted chicken was great, plenty of meat and it was tender and juicy without feeling greasy. I loved the thick pieces of bacon and mushrooms with garlic. The whipped cauliflower was a little salty but it tasted almost the way that I make it!!!! 

Plates here are huge; you could share with someone else! I would have loved to finish my plate but just couldn't, half way through the second piece of chicken and I was started to hit my oh no I'm almost full status!!

I would love to come back and try their breakfast menu as I was eyeballing their pancakes and bacon!!

A+++ for great service, food, and sitting us at an awesome table!
