YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g I've had a crush on chef Hubert Keller watching him on PBS teaching and cooking for many years...as such, here I find myself at Fleur by Hubert Keller in Las Vegas.

Fleur offers a rather casual setting but still maintains an element of class. It is situated adjacent to the casino floor at Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino. We arrived early and were thankful to be seated almost an hour before our reservation as a result. Our server Joe welcomed us with two menus...one Tastes from Around the World 2016 Tasting Menu and an A La Carte Dinner Menu. We decided on the first choice and added the suggested wine pairing at $55 per person.

Food was exciting and succulent throughout the 5 courses. In addition to the wine pairing, each course came with 2 food items plentiful enough for the two of us to share...in fact by the end of the 4th course, we couldn't even finish the 5 course of sweets...and dessert wines.

Since the restaurant is located next to the casino floor, there is heavy foot traffic and lively music playing just 20 steps away from the entrance to Fleur, providing a less than ideal environment, even at the back of the restaurant...after all, you know all of your 6 senses need to work together to make for an amazing experience...this was almost reason enough to drop another star for me. 

We did enjoy the wine pairing, especially the flume blanc paired with the Ox Tail Gnocchi, but we wouldn't do it again since we know what we like better for our palettes.

for these reasons, I award 4 stars for my crush Hubert Keller and the pleasant service...
