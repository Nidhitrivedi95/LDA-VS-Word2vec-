mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q Although my husband and I both love food, this is one of our first dining experiences in this level of establishment. We loved every bite. And being able to watch every move in the kitchen. It's like dinner and a show :)

We got the seasonal tasting menu (because, why not?) and the wine pairing. I will say that I was unimpressed by the wine pairing, and probably would have been happier doing half bottles of white and red as the meal progressed. Or doing cocktails - because the one (Sakai) my husband ordered was phenomenal (although sweeter than expected).

Every dish was well-crafted and delicious. We truly enjoyed the dining experience (all 2.5 hours of it). The $700 price tag hurt a bit, but the fact that we still think it was worth it says something.
