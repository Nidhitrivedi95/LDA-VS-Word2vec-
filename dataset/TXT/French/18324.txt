A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g If you visit this quaint little bakery and bistro, you will soon find out why this is a favorite for many customers.  Fortunate enough to discover Patisserie Manon while visiting family in Las Vegas.  We were searching for some soup while shopping at the local Target and this place came up.  I knew as soon as I entered, the food and desserts would be yummy and it does not disappoint.  We had Chicken Noodle and Split Pea soup for lunch with fresh baguette slices.  The servers were very nice.  We came back later in the day to pick up two pastries - a strawberry Fraizer cake slice and a fruit tart.  I would say everything in the bakery is drool-worthy.  Only wished we had a bakery like this in the Bay Area!
