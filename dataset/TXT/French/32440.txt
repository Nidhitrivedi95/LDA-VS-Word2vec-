We were 2, waited a long time when they were not busy to be seated, we asked for one of the many empty small booths, and were told that they were only for 3 or 4, meanwhile they soon filled up with only groups of 2.
Then our waiter got our order wrong... 
The calamari was bad. 
And the food was nothing to write home about.
Their special beer wasn't even good. 
Bottom line: finally tried it and will not go back.
