T4g4k2OhCTsiqcP-ZXElHQ I came here with great expectations and left a bit disappointed. The french onion soup was alright, but it wasn't baked in the dish the way I like it (this is not influencing my score though). The steak tips were really tough. The salmon was alright, but nothing extraordinary. The menu said the salmon dish would be served with ratatouille, but my plate came with literally 4 pieces of vegetables. 

The crème brûlée was mediocre, and I've had better (where they serve it on a shallow dish so you get a lot of the burnt surface). The chocolate mousse was average.

All in all, I don't think it was worth the price. Maybe next time we'll try the steak dinner for two.
