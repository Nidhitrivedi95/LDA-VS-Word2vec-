5fquJHY2hMX9tPRD5s0t5g We came on nye to get some food before heading out to ring in the new year. The food was moderate. Our service was very poor. I heard people mention good things about this restaurant but I failed to find really anything great to say about it. We got the hangar steak and fries. Our portions were small and that was part of the problem. Maybe I'll just order charcuterie and wine next time. I would recommend for a great dining experience. Mainly just for after work drinks.
