mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q We had an excellent meal  last night, champagne was recommended for us since we couldn't decide and it was perfect. Every dish that came out I wish there was more of, the dish le daikon was my favorite. Very refreshing and so many flavors. The dishes flowed beautifully and came out right after another. Their kitchen was lovely to watch, it was like dinner and a show! I would come back everyday if I could.
