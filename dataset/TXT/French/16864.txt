8xCiibfgqy-8xpCWEaguqg I went to The Keg for a work event we ordered some appetizers to start which were all delicious.. Baked garlic shrimp, tuna tartare, baked Brie, calamari, shrimp cocktail. I ordered a martini and my friend ordered a Cranberry mojito and there was lots of alcohol in them both. For the main I ordered the filet mignon with mashed potatoes and mushrooms. Potatoes were creamy and delicious. Filet mignon was perfectly cooked and melted in your mouth. Service was good considering we were 14 people it took two hours. I would come again.
