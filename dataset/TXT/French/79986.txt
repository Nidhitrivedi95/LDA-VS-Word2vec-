The duck dish had a huge portion and was done perfectly and the sausage was really delicious with a surprising hint of cloves - however, it was paired with beans which was rather heavy and dry and I felt that it needed to be paired with a chutney or something fruity/jus for more contrast. The salmon had a nice crisp to it with the fragrant saffron sauce. 

TERRIBLE SERVICE - Our server Amin was exceptionally fake and cheeky. He offered us wine but we told him water was fine and he totally gave us attitude and abruptly turned away with the menus like he was pissed. When we asked him for more water he wouldn't reply and when we said thank you he didn't reply as if he was reluctant and unhappy with getting us water. There was another waiter with a beard - super friendly and respectful guy- we asked him to refill the water and he replied with "I would love to" and when we said thank you he replied with "you're very welcome". Amin was also very rude when he took our check, he didn't even say thank you and probably was eyeing his tip thinking he didn't get enough. At the end he was super fake. Overall, he left a bad taste in our mouth and a bad impression of such a nice place. The entire night I had wish the bearded fellow had waited us - he was patient and sweet and sincere.
