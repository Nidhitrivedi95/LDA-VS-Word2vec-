rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A truly i'd give this a 3.5

definitely not worth the high prices.

food was decent but not very much above average

our table of two ordered steak frites and the trout. we both agreed the trout tasted a bit "fishy". not fresh but fishy.

the steak was better than the fish, but not above average.

ordered an anchor steam beer on draft for only 4.75, but it was only like a 6 or 8 oz glass!
