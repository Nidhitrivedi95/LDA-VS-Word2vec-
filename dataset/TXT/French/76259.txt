Yp1swb-8pO8i-6-jaK2tsA Horrible. Menus covered with fingerprints, dirty silverware,bad food and miserable staff. The waitress was unfriendly, said there was no cheese in the potatoes, yet they were crawling in it, and half-cooked to boot.  A bite of bacon was worse than a mouthful of salt, and the waffle was about as bland as it gets. I really tried to find a redeeming factor, all I found was the butter was fresh. At the end, the waitress asked if I was done with my (1/4 eaten) meal, and when I said I was, she said "Good!". I definitely will not come back.
