Though the food is pretty good, it is a little expensive, even though that is pretty much a given in an airport restaurant.
I was hoping for more of a vegetarian menu, but lacking that, I went with a short rib baquet. Quite tasty. Fresh baquet bread and good taste to the ribs.
Sam was an excellent bartender/waiter.  Had a great disposition and was always there to fill my drink as well as tending to everyone else.
Nice bar with lots of TVs.
