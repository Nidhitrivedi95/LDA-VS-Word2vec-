xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g Mothers Day early brunch almost turned into Mothers Day Dinner. The food was good abiet a little pricey and the service was acceptable but the kitchen STAFF was either inept or just plain slow. We waited for an hour and twenty minutes for our order to arrive at the table after we placed the order. UNACCEPTABLE I would not recommend this restaurant.
