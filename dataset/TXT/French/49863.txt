Hands down best French pastries and baked goods I've ever had, and for the best price I've ever seen as well. Favorites definitely include the macaron aux fruit (it's massive!), tarte aux framboises, and chocolate eclair. If you live in Pittsburgh, or are even just visiting, please check out this adorable little bakery! A true gem!
