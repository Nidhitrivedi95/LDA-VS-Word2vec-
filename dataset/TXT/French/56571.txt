rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I had the croque madame, classic rendition of a ham and cheese. Although I wished that dish came out hot it was seers a bit cool, nonetheless it was delicious.  Also the pomme Frits were surprisingly excellent without it being too soft and too salty in flavor, a must go for brunch.
