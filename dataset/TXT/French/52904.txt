Came down to visit the Latta Arcade/Brevard Court and while we were here, to grab a quick lunch on a beaufiful Saturday. After walking up and down the venue and reviewing a number of tempting menus, we decided on French Quarter.

The narrow confines of Brevard Court does remind you somewhat of the narrow streets and alley of the French Quarter but the comparison stops there. Nothing on the menu to suggest anything from Bourbon St.

Still a nice Greek/American menu with something for everyone.

Walked in and were seated immediately and were given our choice of where to sit. We picked a table by the window overlooking College Street with Romare Bearden Park immediately across the street. 

Both our host and server were great and efficient along with the young man I assume to be the manager.

From the menu I chose the Corned Beef Sandwich with Fries. The sandwich was excellent and one of the best I have had in a long time.

The French Quarter Salad is worth the trip itself. Large bowl lined with Pita's with and a mound of lettuce in the center and not just lettuce but a bounty of tomatoes, cucumbers, large fresh Croutons and an incredible amount of Chicken.

My wife always complains to salad that are just about all lettuce and maybe one sliver of tomato but not this time.

Fun spot to hand out. With construction and  Jazz festival at the Park, parking can be a bear but we ended up in the parking garage next door. 

Three of four blocks from Bank of American Stadium, one block from the BB&T Ball Park and within walking distance of a number of Arts Venues and Museums, this could serve as a good place to grab a bit when you visit downtown.
