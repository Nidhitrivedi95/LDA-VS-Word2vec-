rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A One of my favorite brunch spots in Vegas.  Beautiful outdoor seating on the patio - shaded and sun both.  The patio is in a courtyard near (but not too near) the hotel pool, complete with large fountain and inviting landscaping.  The food is always superb, as is the service.  Pastries and coffee are my go-to, plus a mimosa of course.  But explore the menu - you can't go wrong!
