ZrHU8ZzwZQjTRpB1K_8JTQ We tried the relaunched Stamm House last night for the first time. They were recently closed for several months to redo their menu, and they've transitioned to more of a supper club concept. The building is charming and historic. We were seated upstairs. It was fairly busy, but not too noisy. We were given a wine and beer list, and I looked for cocktails. None were listed, so I asked our server if they had any special cocktails. He said "not until next week," which I found kind of odd. They have their liquor license, and I saw other customers with drinks. I was hoping he could recommend something to me, but I ended up just getting a beer. As we waited for our food, I noticed other tables around us all had bread baskets. I asked our server if bread baskets were available, and he said "yes," then there was a long pause, and he asked "did you want one?" Well, yes, that's why I was asking about it. It was not delivered until our entrees came out. We had two pepper shakers on the table and no salt shaker, and our candle was unlit until the end of our meal (other tables all had lit candles). Despite the iffy service and mysterious lack of cocktails, the food was a true highlight. I ordered the hashbrown encrusted walleye, which came with delightfully seasoned and fresh green beans. I also had the side of brussel sprouts and bacon, which was both sweet and savory. My husband had the burger, which he enjoyed. I would definitely order the walleye again. Overall, this restaurant shows real promise, despite the kinks in service. We'll visit again for the food (and hopefully cocktails!), and I hope in the mean time they'll work on smooth service. I would definitely recommend that anyone in the Madison area give this unique restaurant a try.
