vg55SAkrEmuHpWfIMtJjBQ Argh yelp when will you give us the half star because legume so deserves 4 1/2! We visited for lunch on a Thursday afternoon. We had tried to stop once before for lunch but be advised they do close between lunch and dinner, so this was our second attempt at lunch here.
I love the vibe in this restaurant! The tables are gorgeous and comfortable. Service was exceptionally friendly. Our server seemed to know the regulars at several of the tables and greeted them with hugs, which I loved watching! 
We ordered nettle soup, the housemade kielbasa and pierogies, and the BLT. I had never tried nettle soup before and it was delicious. Very light and summery and I adored the antique little cast iron crock it was served in. Points for original presentation.
Chris's BLT was humongous. That thing was loaded down with ingredients and the bread was amazing brioche bread. The only downfall was that the sandwich was loaded with so many flavors that you almost lost the bacon. It was definitely there and a perfect texture addition but the flavor got a little lost in the mix. Not a problem though because all the other flavors were so amazing!
The kielbasa was fantastic and the pierogies definitely weren't mrs. T's thank god! (Seriously though restaurants that serve frozen pierogies in this area, it's a sin. Stop it. Log cabin I'm looking at you). We switched meals halfway through so we could both try each others lunches.
They only lost 1/2 a star because it took a really long time to get our food. We were there for almost an hour and a half. But our glasses were never empty and our server kept checking on us and updating us. Not to mention that he dealt with a different table complaining about their blt not having any bacon (after they are the entire sandwich! Really you didn't notice? Sounds like someone wanted a free meal to me) very professionally and courteously. He was a pro!
Can't wait to try out dinner!
