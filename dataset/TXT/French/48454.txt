Sitting at the bar for dinner was great. The staff is professional and caring. Robbie (the owner) tends to his guest like family members. My food was perfect. The selection will please meet lovers and vegetarians as well. Can't wait to tell all my friends about it! Must try: Yellow beets 5 ways, Charcoaled heirloom carrots, the scallop carpaccio and the signature hanger steak with chimichurri will take you to food paradise. JellyFish Montreal is a must try for 2016
