33Tr0eRki1Yamzleu4GMdw We had an excellent breakfast. The pastries, coffee, and hot breakfast items were all excellent. Had we not found a place we liked better elsewhere in town, this would have easily been the best.
I've started writing several sets of comments, and none of them worked. This place is what it is. Very good. Nice selection. Good food. I can't figure anything else to say that works.
