ey9c-TjWXgTJ5OlD0HPd_A To be quite honest, we were a bit underwhelmed when we arrived. The place looks like a little neighborhood café, no more, no less. There were only a couple of locals inside, which is not exactly a good sign on the usually crowded plateau. We selected a couple of waffles on their paper menu and had plain coffees, which were pretty boring (we're big 'ccinos fans). Again, underwhelmed to say the least, but don't be fooled: the main course is a show in itself.

The last time I felt so greedy about a meal was at Apollo, the well known restaurant of renowned chef Giovanni Apollo. Their plates are composed of waffles and delicately assembled sweet and salty treats that literally had me go crazy over what I should eat first. There was a little something to please all of my fancies in my plate, and it really gave me a sense off satisfaction that I honestly never experienced when having breakfast.

One of the plateau's best kept secret. Best bang for you buck in the neighborhood for sure.
