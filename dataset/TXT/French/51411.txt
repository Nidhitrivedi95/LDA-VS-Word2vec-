P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ By the time you're finished with your meal, tax and tip will probably cost you an additional Benjamin, but who's counting at this point;  we're here to celebrate something right?...

Life?... Winnings?...

One of two eponymously named upscale French restaurants, we took the opportunity to dine here during our stay at the hotel.  Attire is less than formal, business casual is fine -- I noticed gentlemen were not even wearing jackets although their dining partners, the ladies were generally more elegant.  Speaking French only helps to shoot the breeze, but otherwise unnecessary;  it's Franc as opposed to Frank.  The ambiance was far simpler than I had first imagined in simple eggshells and warm brown trellises, towering yet understated.  Just look at the peekaboo salt and pepper holders on the table, playful...

Like a magic show, or perhap Cirque du Soleil, the amuse bouche just kept coming.  The first was handed to us on steel toothpicks.  The second had Parmagiano-Reggiano -- oops, this is supposed to be French.  The third was more hide and seek, a sweet corn bisque with a hidden surprise underneath the cup:  some sort of black truffle salmon mousse...

Like Crackerjacks, there's always a prize inside, or in this case one accompanying.  For starters, she had a lobster salad with a prize of salmon roe wrapped in rice paper.  I had the popular creamy truffle soup which was delicious, what else would it be?  A buttered brioche bun accompanies the soup...

Somehow the thought of searing salmon with dry ice elicited visions of a tongue stuck on a flagpole http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/guy-savoy-las-vegas-2#wQv-ZmBQJDeZe5Apkev3Sw.  Having it done this way was mostly for show, but the flesh did turn white http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/guy-savoy-las-vegas-2#KoQjas6CLgqlU5-cNVjKvA.  Other than that it was like eating sashimi.  My bass had a particularly prominent scaly skin that looks reminiscent of Medieval mail armor http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/guy-savoy-las-vegas-2#20oZcFiFbwJG0nfiipQNAg.  Each of our fish dishes were delightful tasting, if not slightly mundane in presentation, considering how pricey it was...

The cheese course as well as the dessert cart are not to be missed.  I'm pretty sure we had a Morbier, a comte, an epoisses, a Roquefort, a Camembert brie, and perhaps a Chaource, and yes Google to the rescue.  This is where the bread cart really shines when paired with the French cheeses...

They wouldn't let us get away without ordering something sweet as an encore to the meal and so a simple macaron and a tangy sorbet were in order...

If nothing else the service was omnipresent but not hovering, strange as that may sound.  There was a small army of servicers that would disappear as quickly as they appeared -- maybe there are hidden cameras, who knows?...

As exquisite an experience this was, the prevalent feeling is that for this kind of money every second of every minute should have been devine and alas, I cannot quite put it on that kind of pedestal.  While every dish was fancy, the portions felt less than fulfilling, meager even by haute standards.  I don't regret being pampered though as I realize that I shouldn't look a proverbial gift horse in the mouth;  I'm very happy we came...
