3jKUbhGSjFTv5jZ0wnW0xA After a ten hour drive, the dinner was exquisite. The ambiance made us feel like two young drunk lovers in France serenaded by a local musician on the street. 

The beef tartare and French onion soup were delicious. The duck confit was finger-lickingly good. The cheese and cold cut plate was well prepared. Definitely something to try if you're a fan of cheese! We had the complementary creme brûlée offered by yelp and it was surprisingly very good as well. Very classic and not too sweet. 

Overall, we had a very lovely experience. The waiter recommended some very good wine to pair with our food and dessert. We feel that all the dishes complemented each other well and you can't go wrong at this restaurant. The servers were very kind and prompt. We will definitely come back again when we're in Montreal!
