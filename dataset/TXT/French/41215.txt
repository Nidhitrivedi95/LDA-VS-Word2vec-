kGOr_D-LNpgZ2M9N8TT4QQ Breaking this down in terms of what makes a good restaurant:

Does it have good service?
No.  Rude wait staff overall.  We went up to the front doors - says "pull "- tried desperately to get in, couldn't figure it out.  Turns out in the winter, you have to enter through the interior entrance.  They finally came to let us in, making us feel like shit about it -- but throughout our entire brunch, we could see countless people doing the same mistake -- why not JUST PUT A SIGN? "Please use other entrance" -- seems like a simple solution.

We had to send back some eggs because they were cold, and the woman just said, "Ok," not "I'm sorry" or anything.  My friend had no pears in her pear salad, and asked why I did get pears, and the woman just said, "Oh, it's fine -" which is totally insane.

Does it have good food?
No.  As noted above, the food was inconsistent.  Some people got heaps and heaps of potatoes, some people got none.  I got three slices of pear, my friend got none.  The food was cold.  Mine was $18 for literally just eggs on a plate (the omelette) - no taste AT ALL and no sides.  One of the stars I am giving this restaurant is for the coffee, which was good. I would prefer to be asked cream or milk, and not just brought milk though.

I liked the ambience and I liked that they didn't add an automatic gratuity to our party of 7.  I won't be back ever again though.
