jSfnItqaOnEp2nenVF7fCg I had written a rather negative review, not about the food which was quite good, about how the staff badly mishandled an issue with a take/out order. I also wrote to the owner on their website with the same concerns. I must tell you I received a very clear and detailed email agreeing with me completely concerning the issue and understood my feelings. He generously refunded the order and invited me to return. I plan to do just that.
