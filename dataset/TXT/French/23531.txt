ChwyMZi_eZlMfL9qpXH_zw I used to live just a few blocks from this "new" crepes joint...I miss it! Sit by the window and people watch les plateauiens (a.k.a) ppl living on the plateau!
It's one of the best crepes spot in Montreal and it deserves to be known as such. 
Try the salted Sarasin (buckwheat) crepes - they are crispy and buttery and hit the spot every time...my favourite is the goat cheese with honey and walnut.
Smiling service. If they could have organic crepes option, I'd definitely give 5 star.
The decor is nice and simple - perhaps it needs a touch of art and personality to make it a very unique place?
That's all you need to know!
