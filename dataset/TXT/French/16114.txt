78TC3sZSYBzBsSJ0z5pyhw Came here to enjoy a nice dinner while in las Vegas. There really wasn't much of a selection of beverages and the wine menu was atrocious! 

I ordered the 3 course meal for $49, I received a generous portion of mussels ( I hate mussels I ordered them for my boyfriend) they came in some sort of marinara sauce which is very weird to say the least. However, per my boyfriend they were pretty good. My main course I got the strip with garlic mashed potatoes and fettuccine Alfredo. Steak was cooked exactly how I wanted, mashed potatoes delish, Alfredo eh not the greatest but still decent. My boyfriend ordered the 8oz filet Oscar style and a side of asparagus. He loved everything about his and that was $40 for the steak alone, $5 for the asparagus and the $10 up charge to go Oscar style. For dessert that was included in my 3 courses we got the berries in an amaretto cream sauce which was to die for! 

All in all the food was Pretty good, but for a French restaurant they again had no wine or champagne selection.
