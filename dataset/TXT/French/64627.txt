Tefx_N6A6nrsdj4jHHnbYg I went here to pick up some croissants and drinks. The croissants were really yummy. I got bunch of regular ones and chocolate ones, and they were both equally good. The chocolate was not too sweet, but just enough to give me some morning energy and sweetness. They brew the earl grey tea for you upon ordering, which was very thickly brewed and nice. 

I would say their price is higher than other bakeries, but I would say its still worth it.
