oS96aJIHFWcFAlGHKKXjaw hands down. one of the best places in pittsburgh. i love this place so much. i have tried to find other amazing french pastry shops in other cities. the only place i have found one that compares to the caliber of La Gourmandine is in NYC, all else fail the test. 
these folks totally spoil pittsburgh and i am so grateful!!!!
