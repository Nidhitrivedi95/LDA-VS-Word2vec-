rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Food was obviously delicious, as it is a  Keller joint. Server was condescending and douchey. I mean it was in Vegas, but the waiter needed to wake up and realize he was serving at Bouchon and not The Elephant Bar. Stop pushing us towards stuff we're not interested. Took 20 minutes to get the bill in a half empty restaurant. Thomas you're a pimp, but Miguel you sucked ass.
