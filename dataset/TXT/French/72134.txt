XKPosZx2j4RHcZ8Ewdwj0A Excellent dessert.  We stopped in after dinner for a sweet treat and we weren't disappointed.  My wife had the French Toast with ice cream and caramel sauce.  It may have ruined us for any other French Toast.  The slice was thick and light.  The sauce and ice cream were the perfect complement.   I had the chocolate tartelette.   The dark chocolate combined with the ginger ice cream and ginger syrup drizzled on the plate, was perfectly balanced.  It was a great end to our day!
