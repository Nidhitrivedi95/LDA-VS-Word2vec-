BSmqxPbQglQwP2R56OqOag Local is our go to place at work when we want a sit down lunch (aka there's an excuse to expense lunch). Food and atmosphere are great! Service is pretty meh.

I'm a creature of habit. I've only had three items here, but they're all delicious- tuna tartare, grilled cheese and the drunk bread. What's drunk bread? It's a chunk of bread served in a skillet with white wine and melted Gruyere. Carbs + melted cheese + alcohol= win. The tuna tartare is also insanely good. It super fresh tasting and comes with a slightly sweet sesame chip. Everyone else has always been happy with their meal choices at lunch. I haven't had it, but the steak frites looks amazing and gets great reviews from my co workers.

Unfortunately because I've only been here for work lunch, I've never been able to enjoy an adult beverage, but the wine selection is huge! When the weather is nice, they open up the windows to the patio bringing a bit of the outdoors in. It would be the perfect place to enjoy a drink on a lazy Sunday afternoon.

Service is kind of lacking. Last week we made a reservation and still had to wait 10 minutes to be seated. We weren't the only ones either. There were several other parties waiting when they were plenty of tables open. The wait staff is okay. Not particularly bad, but also not anything to rave about. I do like that they bring you a tray of citrus in case you want to add lemon, lime, or orange to your water. So bougy.
