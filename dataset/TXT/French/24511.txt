cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg We came to Montreal to experience the cuisine, and this restaurant especially. We were not disappointed. The atmosphere is busy and lively and the service was fantastic. The food was beyond expectation. I ordered a special that was duck confit cannelloni with sliced duck. My girlfriend ordered the duck margarite with mushroom sauce. Both were absolutely fantastic
