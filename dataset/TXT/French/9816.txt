4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw One of my favorite french restaurant. love the location in front of the bellagio fountain so you can enjoy the show while enjoying a great dinner. The atmosphere reminds me of a Brasserie St Germain in Paris.
you enter the restaurant and you feel and can see the craziness of the place like a ballet, the waiters walking around with their tray full of dish or drinks. they are elegantly dressed.
once you are seated, they will bring you a nice warm baguette with some butter and a mise en bouche of the day.
order a pitcher of ST Germain, gosh that cocktail is so enjoyable! it's a mix of St Germain liquor, sparkling white wine and club soda. since i like it sweet i usually ask them to replace the club soda with some sprite or seven up 
i love to start with their country pate or their smoked salmon or their onion soup (to die for)
we often order some brussels moules (mussels), a steak with BÉARNAISE sauce (only served at dinner time), some salmon served with some lentilles.

if you celebrate an anniversary or a birthday, they will offer you a dessert which is very kind of them.

it was my birthday yesterday so i got my little Profiteroles 
forgot to say that they house brew coffee is very good. it doesn't let the "sour coffee taste". 

price are reasonable, food is great!
bon appétit
