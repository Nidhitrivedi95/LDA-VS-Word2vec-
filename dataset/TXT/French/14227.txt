58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw I went here for brunch with a friend at 12 on a weekday. Although we were disappointed to learn brunch is only on weekends, the lunch menu did not disappoint.

We started with the soup of the day and a delicious maple latte. For mains we split the duck and scalloped potatoes (potentially the best I've had) and the pulled pork. We finished off with a piece of deliciously moist carrot cake. Every aspect of the meal was exceptional and the restaurant has lovely vibes.

Can't wait to go back for brunch!
