YUFxSG6idHePsxOmnSHtpQ We always love coming here for breakfast. The staff are always warm and pleasant and willing to serve. On weekends and holidays it can get pretty busy so arrive early. 

Food is good quality and generally served just the right temp. Great coffee and their bakery is fantastic. 

Comfortable and clean.
