That evening my friend and I went we had the maple old fashion. Which was delicious. For appetizer we shared the salmon tar tar with black caviar and fresh shucked oysters. Then we had the pasta with truffles and also the rabbit. All the food had great flavoring.

The restaurant decor was so cute. It made me feel like I was having a meal in a beautiful lodge.  I'd definitely come back again next time I'm in Montreal.
