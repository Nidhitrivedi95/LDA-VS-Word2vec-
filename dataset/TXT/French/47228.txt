O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q Made a res on open table as it was tight this night. Seated us on time and wait staff was all over our party. Great wine selections and all enjoyed their apps with a lot of sharing going on. My rib eye was cooked to perfection and was extremely tender. We shared sides and all were tasty, but could have been portion sized a little larger. All meals very good and ne room for desserts but the ones we saw go by looked by good.
