HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw Happy hour burger was underwhelming. I love the non happy hour one at Comme ca in Los Angeles so maybe it was just due to the price point and location but I'd expect consistency between locations at such a high end restaurant.

My mojito was also bland and weak. Didn't have any lime or mint taste! What a bummer. At least it was fairly empty at happy hour.
