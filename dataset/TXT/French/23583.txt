cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg I have to say, I had expectations. And they weren't exactly met. The food was good, but (and I can't believe I'm saying this), it was too indulgent. Visited in December  2013. 

We had a pretty simple order. An appetizer. Two mains. Drinks. 

The off-menu Christmassy appetizer, which was a slice of foie gras, fruit cake, and goat cheese, was interesting. It was an odd melange of flavours, but we didn't come here for typical restaurant fare. So the appetizer got us excited for the mains. 

My date had duck in a can. It was pretty good from what I tasted. Today all she remembers is plate full of Brown and won't be eating foie gras again, though she's glad she's tried it. 

I had the off menu (and highly recommended by our server) veal shank with cauliflower mash. The mash was amazing. Really soft textures with a few lumps here and there. Mixed in with the juices of the shank and you got this beautiful velvety texture. Definite win. 

The shank left more to be desired. Not because it was small (it was epic meal time huge) but because the flavours transformed from beefy goodness to oh-my-god-this-carcass-never-ends. And that's what it felt like after a while. The soft texture eventually reminded me of cutting and chewing into raw flesh. And with the gamey smell and the beefy flavour just lingering in my mouth, I had to abandon the dish. 

I never abandon dishes. And I didn't abandon this one because it was too much food and I was too full, but because the flavours and textures became repulsive halfway through the experience. I only got though 1/3 of that shank. 

I don't regret trying this place but it's unlikely I'll return.
