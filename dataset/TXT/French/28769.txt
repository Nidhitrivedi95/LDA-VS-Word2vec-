The vegetable soup was creamy and rich, the escargots were just right and the duck magret was very tasty. The dessert platter with a mix of different desserts (mousse, creme brulee, etc) was a perfect way to finish the meal. Service was friendly and speedy. I would be happy to recommend this place to friends who are coming from out of town.
