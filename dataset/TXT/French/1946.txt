0JGMKaKJGVuDus5WcJzvjw I think I found my favourite brunch food!! Can I have Crepes au Foie Gras ($22) every weekend? The foie gras wrapped in bacon inside my crepe and finished off with maple syrup!

Liverpool House was definitely my best dining experience during my weekend in Montreal. The service here is excellent, our waitress was so kind in going through every single item on the menu with us in English.... including how each dish is prepared and ingredients used! She did make everything sounded delicious....

We ended up ordering and sharing:

Entrees: Crepes au Foie Gras ($22) & Pieuxre Mauritius & Pakoras ($18) 
- love both dishes: both interesting as the foie gras has all the traditional element vs the pakoras is kind of a fusion dish..

Plats: Spaghetti Homard - Lobster ($49)
- A little disappointing, though the pasta was cooked well and the sauce was complimenting the seafood but the lobster has this mushy texture 

Dessert: Merveilleux Aux Marrons ($9)
- hot dark chocolate poured on top of marrons cake... crunchy and sweet Vs hot and bitter... what a happy ending! :)

I can't wait to go back and try other items on the menu... In fact I have already booked a reservation at Liverpool House for my next weekend in Montreal!

And for the time being, I just dream about the foie gras............so buttery..........stuffed full of it...
