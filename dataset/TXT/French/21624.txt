bEVWHtBRYVwqaaNF4mWNYg Great restaurant in the area. Perfect for a casual/low key date.

Steak frites was pretty good for $18. The frites come with a garlicky parmesan topping, ketchup and housemade mayo. The frites were especially good.

The Coquine salad is delicious, with the perfect combination of blue cheese, candied walnuts, figs and prosciutto on a generous amount of arugula. Good size, too, which makes you feel less bad about ordering all that meat and fat for the entrée. The green salad was good too, as was the rack of lamb. The food is rich and delicious at good value. 

The wine list is decent. Definitely not the highlight of the place, though. They have a martini menu too. The wine list was good for a restaurant at this price point.

Too full for dessert, but they had crème brûlée and something chocolatey (that's all I really look for).

It was Sunday and they had some loud, Spanish language band playing. It was kind of nice but a bit loud.

This place is a solid spot for a casual dinner. Go here if you want delicious French comfort food at a good price.
