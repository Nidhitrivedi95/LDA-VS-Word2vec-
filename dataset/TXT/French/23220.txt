C3PVq7UpeHd6nz1_e-AtkA We went here for brunch on a Saturday. We sat on the sidewalk patio which was really nice. It's at a great location on College at Euclid so it's fun to sit outside on a sunny day and watch the foot traffic go by. The coffee was decent and the service was prompt and friendly. 
Unfortunately, the food wasn't very exciting. The best thing we ordered was my date's eggs napoleon. The ingredients were fresh, the sauce on the eggs was quite nice and the fried potatoes were good. The eggs themselves were overcooked though, so no runny yolk deliciousness dripping down onto the croissant. I had the most boring french toast of all time. I can't really say more than that. I mean... it was just boring, dry french toast made with nondescript bread and some nasty fruit compote on top. I got a side of sausages which were equally boring. 
Oh well. I could see myself trying this place again for dinner... or just coming for drinks. The atmosphere inside did look quite inviting.
