P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ Amazing meal. One of the best restaurant I've eaten at. I settle for the innovation/inspiration menu which is their 14 course tasting menu and it was superb. My favorite dish was the salmon iceberg, raw salmon sear on dry ice and then serve with hot lemongrass broth done in table side by a very friendly chef Julian Asseo. The wine pairing was perfect and the sommelier very knowledgeable  and helpful. I highly recommend Restaurant Guy Savoy to any food lover.
Thank you
