Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA Was too blown away by the view from the 50something floor of TheHotel @ Mandalay Bay.  This has got to be the best view of the strip.  Hands down.  Classy club, classy crowd, not-so-classy music (hence lose one star).  We had to wait for a bit at the front but it wasn't unbearably long.  Once we're in, we knew why there were such a big crowd outside waiting for the bouncer to grow a heart and let them in.  

This has a feel of a lounge more than a club. The dance floor was a bit small, and the majority of the area is filled with couches and a narrow walkway between the couches and the bar.  If you have an expense account getting a table service is a must.
