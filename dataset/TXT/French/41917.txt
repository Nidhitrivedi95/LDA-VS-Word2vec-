Kut9tVbDX_f7qKMRRoXg3w This place is touristy to the point of self-satire and is possibly the most inauthentic dining experience I've had in the province of Quebec.  It's replete with Old Country kitsch, ranging from the plastic sides of ham hanging in the window, to the cheesy music and faux marché decor, to the surly and indifferent service (which is so jarring that it must be deliberate).  It is also the restaurant in your hometown that is well located for tourists but at which you would never eat.  

I say two stars because the food was edible; the tuna salad was well presented but the vegetables had been sitting out for a while.  They overcharged us on our bill; there was a menu item at a lower price which matched a combination on the more expensive table d'hote.  

Eat here if you're famished to the point of crankiness, it's Sunday, and Olive and Gourmando is closed.  C'est tout.  Montreal has so many wonderful restaurants that patronizing tourist traps like this feels like a disservice to the entire city, as well as yourself, and a waste of a perfectly good meal.
