ohMpNug5zWNxOlL6ShG7Ig We were pleased to have a late lunch here after a long drive from Gallup, New Mexico.  It is very close to our house in Scottsdale.
  We had a nice corner booth next to the chefs area so we could witness all excellent preparation.  
  I had a cup of Gazpacho which was very tasty!  My Brunch ,or dinner was the Salmon, bacon lettuce  and tomato  sandwich.  The bread chosen was delicious in and of itself.  This was a great dinner for me.  I would order it again.
  My wife started with a large helping of Fried Okra.  She loves Okra; and, she said it was super!.  For her dinner she had the chopped salad, which had everything in it.
  I had a Pinot Grigio from New Zealand .  I was surprised how smooth it was.  My wife had the Raeburn Chardonnay . It is always good.
  For dessert I had ice cream.
Our server was Matt.  He was very attentive to all our many needs, ie glass of ice only,  two ice waters, etc. Matt was assisted from time to time by Debra who was most professional!!
  CHEF BINKLEY is widely known in our area for providing the best experience , most updated menu; and always with fresh, in season ingredients.

Sincerely,

Ed Altman Jr
