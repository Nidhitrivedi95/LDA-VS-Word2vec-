4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw came here for lunch on a sunday morning, and my table of 7 was sat almost immediately on the heated patio. there's a dark inner area, inside patio area (glass walls/roof) and then an outside patio area with a generous amount of heat lamps and seats where you can people watch everyone on the strip while enjoying your meal.
i got the croissant sandwich with turkey and avocado and the rest of my family got the salad, eggs benedict, and spinach omelette. prices were relatively cheap considering this was a restaurant on the strip in a steakhouse, and all food tasted not bad. the portions were probably the perfect amount for lunch: not too much but not too little. given the great service and the ambiance of our meal, i bumped a 3 star meal up to 4 stars. this is a great place to have breakfast or lunch on the patio on a clear Paradise morning :)
