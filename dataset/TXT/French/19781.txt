ok, so they don't call it a whoopie pie at Bouchon, but that's pretty much what it was. Two soft carrot cake "cookies" with cream cheese frosting in between. One of my fave things to pick up now, besides their signature bouchons. Not a huge fan of their huge macarons, but they are definitely beautiful http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw?select=Rc0y67A4_DJoVyxulDozlg

* This is a kiosk- not a full blown bakery like i was expecting. 
Next on my list to try: Jenny's S rec of Apple Croissant!
