4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Ate dinner this time. Didn't mind sitting inside, so no wait YAY! Ordered a glass of Riesling, side of Brussels sprouts with bacon, spinach, and half order of mussels. 

As always, love the fresh baguette. For dinner they also give a nice little apple, radish, vinegar salad that was really good. The mussels were just ok. Also, one of them was still closed, which you're not supposed to eat. Honestly, from such a nice restaurant, they're supposed to check in the kitchen and throw it out. This makes me wonder what else they may have missed... 

The Brussels sprouts with bacon were really good. When they say bacon, they mean chunks of pork belly. It was AWESOME. The spinach was overcooked and boring. Again, I expect more from this place. I guess I should stick to the main dishes, but I don't eat very much and avoid large slabs of meat. I heard the waiter say they are known for their steak that is just cooked in butter. Maybe next time. 

Oh yes, and dessert was the baked apple tartine. It would have been one the most awesome deserts ever had it not been sitting in a pool of syrup sauce. It soaked into everything, and it was like injecting my veins with pure sugar. I would try to order the sauce on the side, then it would be perfect.  

Otherwise I think I'll stick to brunch. My last review from brunch:

Brunch on Saturday. Ordered a mimosa and french toast. The french toast was served with house made blueberry syrup, with fresh blueberries on the side. Wasn't too sweet, until I got too full. Brought it back to my room to snack on later. Heated it up in the microwave, and it was still ok. Not as good, but still a good snack. All meals come with a fresh baguette. Yum!
