4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw i had a wonderful experience here.  if you have to, just go here once. do wait for the patio seating so you can have a view of the bellagio fountains.  since it was my first time here, why not eat some escargot - snails soaked in oil? butter? and pesto? the snails were chewy and had the same texture as oyster or mussel... totally edible and all i felt like i was eating was butter. 

the drinks are good.  martinis are creepers.

the main course i had was the steak frites.... i think that's right.  it basically looked like a fajita steak and potato chips.  it was still good anyway.  definitely coming back.
