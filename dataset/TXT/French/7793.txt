4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I went here for dinner tonight as a group of four. We were seated after a a brief 10 minute wait. There was a long line inside but luckily we had reservations. It's a tourist attraction especially since guests like to sit outside on the strip for people watching. Honestly, everything to the bread to my porkchops was extremely mediocre.My entree was so dry i only took couple bites. I would rather go eat at in-n-out for the food quality and price point. The only good thing i can say about this place is how service is really great. It really made up for the flavorless food.
