I know it probably seems strange, but their chicken is some of the most tender and flavorful chicken I have had. My husband and I love this place.  It is a pretty cozy place, and recommend getting a reservation, but it's well worth it.  And the cocktails are delicious and addicting.  I've come here probably 5 times, and I've gotten chicken 4/5 times because it's that good.
