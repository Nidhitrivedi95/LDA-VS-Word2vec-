bzbNGyrTwWHAgg1CqkSgeg Led astray by The Charlotte Agenda and Yelp. This place was mediocre at best. 

Unremarkable food and drink: Flavorless but expensive mimosa, bland crab cake eggs benedict, fine fried green tomatoes. My friend found the shrimp and grits less than edible. Just-okay cheese grits, but The Flying Biscuit has spoiled me there. 

Slow and spotty service: We stood in the middle of the restaurant while our hostess checked tables after she already told us to follow her. They were out of Splenda. Didn't bring my coffee until the end of the meal, and had to ask three times for it -- and then again for cream. 

Why would people eat here? I don't get it. Sorry I subjected my friends to this subpar brunch.
