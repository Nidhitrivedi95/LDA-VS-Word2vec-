Salad was fantastic and fresh. Whole hazelnuts. Greens were not bitter.

Entree - here's where it gets really good!  Wow, so good; perfect compliment of flavors. Carpaccio, capers, fresh squeezed lemon. Sliced cheese. Salted Portobello mushrooms. 

A decent half bottle of wine (red or white) compliments the dinner choice and is part of the fixed price meal.

Service - very prompt, frequent and friendly.  I would describe them as a "professional" wait staff.  The English speaking is so-so here
