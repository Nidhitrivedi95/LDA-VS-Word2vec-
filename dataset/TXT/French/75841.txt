ynwARDp7X2fi6hk9XCOSNQ We had the worst dining experience of our entire vacation at this restaurant during our recent trip to Montreal. Our server was terrible and the food wasn't much better. I assume most patrons choose this place based on it's location on the Rue St-Paul and outdoor cafe seating with views of the harbor & open air market containing lots of cartsand street performers. What I can tell you is the food was entirely forgettable. I had the Atlantic Salmon plate with rice and greens and it was completly flavorless. My wife had the quesadilla and got sick less than 2 hours later. My daughter ordered the chicken fingers (4 small pieces) with frites and even she didn't eat all of them and she loves chicken. Overall it was a very disappointing  experience and one I wish to never relive.
