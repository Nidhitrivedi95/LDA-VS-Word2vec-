4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I finally ate here today!  For many years, I would walk by and hope that I could get a table on the Terrace and watch the action on the Strip.   Today was my day!

At 3.00, I was walking by and saw a great table open on the Terrace.  Within minutes, I grabbed it and began my wonderful evening of drinking Whiskey, eating an excellent Steak Frites Plate (French style Steak and Fries) and savoring a Banana Foster's Crepe........while daydreaming and checking out the beautiful Bellagio Fountain Show (5 times) and enjoying the cool people watching on the Amazing Strip.

This was one of most entertaining afternoons on the Strip.  If you can, you must do this once....its worth the entire trip to Vegas!
