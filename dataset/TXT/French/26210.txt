d482l58ho0_IMdFkXX1F5Q I came in to this new addition to the Venetian food scene with the highest of hopes. Daniel Boulude's triumphant return to Vegas is not without high expectations. I had, of course, read up on who was joining Chef Daniel's army of chefs and contributors and was astonished to learn of Chef Dave Middleton and Chef John Courtney's reunification. This phenomenal pair had already impressed the Las Vegas food scene at Marche Bacchus, an off strip locals spot, with their French nuances paired with a classy touch of modernity. But this time, they were in the big leagues, and they are privileged to compete under Chef Daniel's unyielding standard. No taste bud was left unturned. The artichoke velouté, coq au vin, and pistachio cherry were perfection and a true treat. The Tunisian inspired lamb, and an unexpected dish, the Thai calamarie, have such depth and take you through every sensation. Thank you Chef Daniel for your stylish return to our city, you do not disappoint. Chef Dave and his right hand, Chef John are representing you beautifully.
