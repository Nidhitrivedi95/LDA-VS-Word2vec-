AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw Great little breeakfast cafe in Caeser's Palace.  Here for my buddy's birthday bash.  Had a great time.  My friends got into an argument with the Host manning the front door.  He got a little fresh with them and as paying high roller guests, they had nothing of it and it turned into a shoving match.  When the owner or manager got involved it was all smoothed over before I arrived, but still bad form on the host's part.  So minus one star for otherwise great breakfast.  Great service, and excellent food.  Thank you Payard :)
