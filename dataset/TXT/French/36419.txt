Overall good, if not great, sandwich.  Only down side was the bread.  To be fair it was a very good bread but...the top was way too crispy/crunchy.  This in turn made it very hard to bite through without scratching up the top of my mouth.  There are other bread choices so I think I'll try one of them next time.

As far as price for what you get I found it to be very reasonable.

If you're familiar with DeFalcos you'll like this place.  Menu isn't as large but the quality is certainly equal.
