oS96aJIHFWcFAlGHKKXjaw La Gourmandine has been getting busier and busier to the point the line ends outside of the front door two businesses down. But with the amazing service you still get in and out in ten minutes. 

Here's how your experience will go... 
You squeeze into the place before you can truly fit just so can smell all the goodness coming from the kitchen. Surprisingly, faster than you think a girl that was just moving at light-speed but is now calm with a smile ask your order. You order amazing warm bread and flaky pastry while trying to avoid attempting an accent. after your order you drool over the glass counter protects colorful tasty deserts. The service is one of the best so very soon before you impulsively buy a tart cake fore yourself.  You are getting rung up by another smiling girl who you cant help but love and be jealous of for some reason. The cost of your three pastries and a cup of coffee will be like 8 dollars.  As you leave you see the faces of the next bunch of customers who walk in with a smile.  You cant help but smile yourself as you leave while already shoving a ripped piece of bread into your mouth. 

The food thou is amazing and extremely fresh. Eat the baguette that day though high quality bread is only meant to last a day then just buy another the next morning.
