4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Good food, and great view. Before eating dinner we had drinks in the Eiffel Tower restaurant in Paris. I'm happy that we only had a drink, and then dined at Mon Ami Gabi. The view of the strip was great, and the people watching was even better.

My husband and I both had the special which was the beef wellington with spinach. The steak was cooked perfectly and the puff pastry was perfectly crisp. The mashed potatoes were also tasty as a side. The best part is this restaurant has great food and doesn't break the bank. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a good meal on The Strip.
