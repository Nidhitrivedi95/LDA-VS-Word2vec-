BSmqxPbQglQwP2R56OqOag First, I will start by stating that the pizza (to go) was actually good.  Unfortunately, it was quite the wait and when I went for a slice on the way home, I realized it was cold and must have been sitting for a while before they brought it out.  Nevertheless, the wait was amusing, as I probably watched at least 3 different table drill into the manager for poor service/food.  That guy took a beating!  Good atmosphere,  just looked poorly staffed/managed.
