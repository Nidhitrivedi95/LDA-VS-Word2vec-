qr3iie2aA1ddJasU-6N1gQ First of all i was Excited to eat here because its was well presented. 
Once i walked inn i sat next to my sister who was at the bar. 
The bartender/ server saw me and didn't acknowledge me at all.
Finally after 5 mins she says (need a menu? )
Im like okay maybe the server sucks but the the food maybe great. 
WRONG i ordered to go what a mess nothing special the server put no napkins nothing no utensils i was so disappointed  + she was slow and i tipped her. The food was A-ok. I do come to Henderson ONCE a year every year and i will Never ever go there again. 
So for that i give 3 stars because i don't blame the owner i blame the employee and maybe what i order wasn't the best even though (server said it was the most popular). I'll be nice enough not to put her name because i still have the receipt  but the boy servers were amazing credit to them!!!
