SJo_IjvzdRtCvZVN0cbrRQ We have been to The Blue Door for lunch/brunch several times and enjoyed each one. This was our 3rd visit to The Door as part of their Dinner Service.  Each dinner visit has been very good and this one may have been the best of the 3. 

The food is always wonderfully unique for the area in its variety and preparation.  Especially when combined with the cafe's more casual environment. 

Each course has been excellent but I especially appreciate the sauces that the Chef uses to complete each plate. The recent addition of wine pairings added beautifully to the meal.  

I see The Blue Door as a local gem and hope to continue to visit often in the future.
