6tlbZydPbL0Q3_eolg2OJA Best crepes hands down!!! The place itself is a little small. We were seated by the window and I felt a little cramped but the place is super cute. The savoury crepes were amazing. The desert one we got was just with hazelnut spread and whipped cream. It was just okay. Loved the coffee! Came in a little French press.
