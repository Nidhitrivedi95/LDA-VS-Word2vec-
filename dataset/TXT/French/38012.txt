JePdoHGJ2kWRQkfGx0T34Q I came here a couple of months ago with my parents for their inaugural Portuguese chicken meal - I was so proud *tear*.  This place is definitely intended more for take-out than eat-in, as there were only about 4 tables.  The staff were very friendly throughout my parents many questions (it's BBQ chicken, it's not that complicated), and eventually we sat down at the only table big enough for 3 people.  I could tell that it's a real family and neighbourhood joint, as everyone who came in got a cheerful greeting.  

But on to the food.  This is Portuguese chicken done right - the flavour seeps right into the meat so that it's absolutely delicious even before you add the spicy and flavourful piri piri sauce.  My dad loves spice so he really poured this all over everything - and there was a lot to pour it on.  The servings were huge, with tons of potatoes and rice.  I was a little disappointed because I'd been led to believe that there would be shrimp in the rice.  There wasn't.  But it just took another bite of chicken to lift my spirits again.  

All in all, great food at a great price that you should probably take home to enjoy.  If this was in my neighbourhood I'd be a regular.
