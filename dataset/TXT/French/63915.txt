Butter is perfect temperature.
Great energy in the place and awesome mural on back wall.

Artichoke ouster soup was excellent. Perfect amount of cream with a dollop of whipped butter cream on top

Cod On Chinese artichoke and honey cap mushrooms
Wow!  Cod was flaky and crumbled right off the skin. In a bed of tiny sea shell looking pasta which turns out is Chinese artichoke and offers a delightful crunch to the soft fish. Small bits of bacon are mingled in as well - not overly crisp to not distract but only compliment the fish.  Also a fine small amount of honey cap mushrooms and sauce. Excellent.
