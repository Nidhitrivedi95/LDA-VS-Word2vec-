aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw We usually go to the original location in Yountville, but we were craving an Oh Oh. This is their spin off of the Ho Ho.  It is the BEST when sitting in room temp until the chill comes off. When it's too cold, the flavors don't come through as much. Anyway, paired with a cup of coffee, it is worth the $6.  A must try!
