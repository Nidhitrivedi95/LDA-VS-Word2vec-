yYzZScLRg1tNaZZrlz1Z3A Went there today and a man hit his dog twice!!!  The atmosphere changed drastically and not one employee had the nerve to approach him. So I spoke to the manager and their reasoning was because the owners wouldn't care and wouldn't allow them to ask someone to leave!! Great place!!!!!! Never going back for that reason. To allow idiots to abuse their animals publicly is disgusting! Shame on you hot dog cafe for not standing up for the animals you claim to love...not sure about that anymore.
