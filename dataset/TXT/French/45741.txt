mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q Beautifully well crafted food in an incredible environment.
I truly enjoy coming here for its romantic atmosphere and breath taking food. Everything from presentation, to flavor, is worth indulging in every moment.

The service is wonderful but remember, the French like to take thier time on good cuisine so no need to be in any sort of a rush. 

Hands down in my top ten favorite restaurants of Las Vegas.
