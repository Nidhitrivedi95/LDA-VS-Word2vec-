P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ Guy Savoy set the standard for fine dining.  Our dinner last night was remarkable.  

The food was exquisite.  I had the lobster, fois gras, and the artichoke truffe soup. The presentation was beautiful.  The food was defiantly the star. 

The host was wonderful and the service was impecable. She insured our experience was remarkable.  She was very patient and treated us very wel.

An evening at Guy Savoy is an experience to be savored.  I am afraid to come back only because the experience was so perfect.
