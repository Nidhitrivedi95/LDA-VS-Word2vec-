gjCmXkMNVE0JSk8puUwv6g Such a great experience. The service, the food, the ambiance; all 10/10.
We ordered three different types of the Las Vegas menu and it filled us up completely. The perfect Las Vegas menu combo would include a salmon sandwich, butternut squash soup, with tiramisu and raspberry lemonade. 
The menu changes frequently and was told it would change again towards the end of April. I'm excited go come back to try the new menu in the future. 
Definitely should try this place out if you are in the area.
