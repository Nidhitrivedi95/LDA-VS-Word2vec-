jT-KFrbwr5iE-_vrVLpmiw Food selection was good.  I was actually surprised they had items like fish & chips, lamb burger, crepes, shawarma, and alcoholic drinks.  I ordered the lamb burger with fries.  Yumz.  Everything was decently priced.  Decor was nice especially the bathrooms.  They have high tech dryer and hand washing technology.  Friendly staff.  I would return.  Definitely worth a try.  This is a order at the front then they bring u your food type restaurant, you don't order at your table.  Pretty good experience overall.
