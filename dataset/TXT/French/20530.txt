AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw We just went here today for a quick lunch. I ordered the Cobb salad and my husband had something like a caprese sandwich although with a different name.

The person taking our order was pretty rude and short with us. My husband enjoyed the sandwich, but my salad was not very good.  The ingredients seemed fine, but they only had two dressing choices, ceasar and "mustard". The rude lady insisted that mustard went best with Cobb, even though I asked for a different choice twice. 

The mustard dressing was terrible, it was like eating salad with horseradish or wasabi in it. Just didn't taste good or match. 

Also, for the two items our bill was over $30! And my husbands sandwich was REALLY small, like the size of one of those tiny microwave burritos that are 3 for $1 
 
I probably wouldn't return.
