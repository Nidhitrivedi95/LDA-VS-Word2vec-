LjOBNcNNpuewBqSPxYYTJQ It may have the name and flair of a French bakery, but its far from it. I ordered a egg and cheese croissant and it was nasty. Super oily and greasy and can't taste the butteriness of the croissant. Their desserts and coffee aren't that great either. There are plenty other great coffee shops with better coffee and better breakfast options. This place is a huge disappointment and would not recommend going here. Go someplace where there are better options for coffee, desserts and breakfast.
