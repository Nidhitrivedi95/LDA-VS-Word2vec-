H464UiJ5c7q5dAJ14h731A So we called up Gus restaurant, spoke to David Ferguson on a Friday afternoon to get a possible reservation for the same evening. Not a problem at the bar!  We arrive to be greeted by David, knowing him from Joli fou, we get our place at the bar right in front of David.
We get a drink, take a look at the menu, friends had said it was more of a comfort food menu, decided on a gigot de agneau, and a confit de canard, a shrimp tempura to begin. The shrimp arrives tasteless, no flavour, no salt, no pepper, nothing, with a mango sauce dip, nothing to write home about!
Then David calls the order to Josh for the main course, and Josh says last confit! Somehow a short while, 20 ,minutes later, David announces the confit was a mix up, somehow another table was served, he says it will be another 20 minutes? But remembering hearing that that was the last one, sounded strange, there would be another pulled out of the air or freezer? Possibly frozen, so it finally arrives, and is quite ordinary, the agneau does not measure up either, very chewy, but the over praised rapini vegetable of the day, is served sautéed for 30 seconds, raw, bitter, and no flavour! Not even a spec of salt? Leaving quite disappointed, wondering what had just transpired, walked home and felt an overwhelming feeling of illness, something with the canard was very off. Will confer with  friends to see if just maybe it was an off night for the place, or are we just better cooks ourselves?
