L3VlGzHgsbmaZ5oUnWvINg Tried to buy a growler of something they had on tap and was told by the owner 'no, not this beer' - no explanation as to why. When I asked if I could place an order for bottles of the same beer (since the growler wasn't an option) I was told 'the beer company doesn't sell it in bottles'
Subsequently found and purchased two bottles of the desired beer  elsewhere. 
Felt like I was a nuisance to the owner when I was trying to make a purchase. I have been a long-time customer in the shop and on the deck and am not going to make any purchases here in the foreseeable future.
