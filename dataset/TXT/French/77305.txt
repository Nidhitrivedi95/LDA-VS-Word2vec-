YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g (4.5 stars) I was a little skeptical of the high reviews, but I can now say they are spot on. In fact, I had such an exceptional meal that I ended up eating at the bar the next night. Thus, I got to end up trying 20+ items. I knew I would like this place right off the bat when they had Dogfish Head 90 minute IPA along with great bar snacks. As others mention, you cant miss the tuns tacos, onion soup, ravioli, skirt steak, etc. One dish not mentioned yet that I loved was the scallops (never had a better cooked scallop). For such an ambitious menu, I was surprised how well executed everything was. Sure, some dishes were simple and straightforward, but others went way beyond what you would typically find in the small plate/tapas concept. Service was great with the exception of the pacing of the food, but between the extensive menu, two major conventions in town and the restaurant being a few weeks old, it is understandable. I would certainly put this on the short list of places in Las Vegas.
