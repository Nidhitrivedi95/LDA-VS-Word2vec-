A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g My daughter and I ended up in this shopping center since we got her first haircut two doors down. I knew I just had to come here after reading the review my girl Nik O. had just left for it. I came in feeling a little intimidated since I'm not a French foodie and I didn't know too much about French desserts but the helpful (and dare I say handsome) French man (and possibly owner?) was happy to answer my 30 questions about every type of pastry and bag them all up for me. When I inquired about the macaroons, he asked if I've ever had one, and when I said no, he happily handed me a chocolate one to try. 

The standouts from my order included the layered cake with fresh strawberries and almonds as well as the flan. My kids like sweets, but often more along the candy spectrum because they're kids. I have never seen them fight over a piece of cake as much as the one with strawberries, (hey, at least they're eating fruit) I thought Fight Club 2 was going to break out in my dining room. The flan is like the Mexican flan I'm used to, but inside of a pastry crust so it's smooth but also has a great crunchy texture. It was also bigger than a slice of pizza for under $5 (I think) and may have ruined all other flan for us. 

While going to the after Christmas sales, I told my husband I wanted to go to French Connection and he retorted I want French flan. Patisserie Manon, we will be back.
