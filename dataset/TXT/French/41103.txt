kevp3zZnKe6z-erUffgHuw Unprofessional waitress.... Waiting for an hour for a patio table, and the waitress completely forgot us and gave 2 patios to somebody just came 5 mins ago...unable to deal with customers' complaints... don't understand English.... We are very disappointed.... Actually the food (main course )  was nice but it definitely doesn't worth the price....beef  tarta ,  duck tarta was delicious,  but other than main course, onion soup is $8 and it's nothing better then an home made onion soup... Overall it's okay... But I wouldn't go for the second time  because I feel like I am paying more then the service they can provide....
