JezHN-9KKLTMbojq00VP0g Great brunch spot. Ohio city has a wealth of brunch places but the majority of them are a bit overpriced for what you get. This place however is as good or not better than the other options and also modestly priced. It's a little on the small side as far as room but we had no problem getting a spot and it fits the French cafe style pretty well.
