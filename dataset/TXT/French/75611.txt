yenHHL1QMjj2iAiYu6TRyQ Went there on a Monday night. Service was excellent and the food was good. I had the mussel and fries and they aee excellent.  I did not take any dessert but some at our table did. Be warn if you take the cannoli. Theirs 2 in the plate and they are big. The decor would be in need of a bit of an upgrade but at least the food is always good.
