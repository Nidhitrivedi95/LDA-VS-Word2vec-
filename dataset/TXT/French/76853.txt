ysJo5Jdo29XOBCnKrbUKWg Went to Paris 66 for brunch last Sunday.  Great atmosphere.  We had 1pm reservation and got seated immediately.  We sat on the patio which was heated.  The tables were a little close to each other.  Service was really good even with our waiter in training.  We ordered the brunch special which was incredible.  We both loved the eggs and crepes!  Coffee was excellent !  Only complaint would be the price for the brunch was about $6 too much.  We'll be back though.
