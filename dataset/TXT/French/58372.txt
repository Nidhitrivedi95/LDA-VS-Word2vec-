rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Awesome for Brunch.

Went with a total party of four, we had to wait 15 minutes for brunch. Location is a little harder to find which is not located near the casino.  If you go from Venetian main entrance, steer right and ride the elevator to 2nd floor and follow the sign. 

The decadent decor and ambiance is relaxing and lively.  Our waitress was splendid and we were taken care of.  

Food was awesome, our party had shared the french toast (little too sweet to eat as a meal but great for sharing and having a bite).  I had ordered the smoked salmon, the saumon fume.  My food came out awesome and everything looked fresh.

Originally, I had ordered the raspberry beignet but they were out (I was kind of bummed about that).  

Overall, it was a great time with great food.  Would definitely come back again and highly recommend trying.
