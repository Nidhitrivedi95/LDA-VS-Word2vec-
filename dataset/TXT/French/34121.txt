hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA I have seen this place coming off the freeway but never came. One day my sister told me to meet her there for lunch and im so happy she did. 

This place is small, has a great menu as well as is just a random place in the middle of nowhere and its great. We both got the chipotle chicken sandwich. It was all that it said it was and was just fantastic. They brew their iced tea unsweetened which i love.

This place isnt anything glitzy and nothing over the top. Its the perfect place for a nice peaceful lunch.
