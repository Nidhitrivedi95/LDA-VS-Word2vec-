Q8n1HaDyBKYUazQ108O5OA When I found out I was to go to Edinburgh with the Yelp UK team, I was excited. When I found out I was staying in the Hotel Du Vin, even more so. We have a Hotel Du Vin in Birmingham (see review http://www.yelp.co.uk/biz/hotel-du-vin-birmingham?hrid=Ii2m4dKv7F_RbVSgsyP3gg), but I've obviously never had call to stay here as I live in the City Centre. 

This lovely building located in the old section of Edinburgh is so tasteful and classic, I practically felt out of place! That isn't to say that the staff weren't warm, welcoming and helpful - I'm just not very good at doing "posh"! 

I stayed here for three nights total and had breakfast on each of the mornings. The rooms were small, but well equipped (Yum... Nespresso machine) and offered all the creature comforts you would want from a hotel. The bath tubs were huge and I still regret not making time to grab a soak when I have the chance. The rain forest shower was also lovely though, so I can't really complain.

In terms of extra touches, as well as the coffee pods (which were in a walnut presentation case and replaced everyday) the bathroom goodies (shower gel, conditioner, shower cap and cotton buds) were of a good quality and didn't wreck my sensitive skin or untameable hair - bonus!

The breakfast here was Great! With a buffet selection of pastries, yoghurts, fruits and cold items and a full hot menu included in the price of the room - I have no complaints about the selection. When 6 of us went to brekkie together, there was a bit of a wait; but this didn't ruin the experience.

The upstairs bar area is delightful for a nightcap and the outdoor area is magical at night; it's all lit up with string lights making it a great spot to enjoy a last beer before bedtime. 

All in all I had a nice stay at Hotel Du Vin. The rooms were either a bit warm or a bit noisy with the air conditioning on - but the beds were comfy and the decor was lovely. A solid 4 out of 5.
