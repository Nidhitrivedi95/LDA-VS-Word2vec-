1ThbwFVBL9YA2oOM11iO7g It appears that the point where Ossington meets Queen is not just reserved for really shady looking karaoke bars and the mentally ill (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/camh---community-services-toronto).  Not only do we have a dandy drinking hole in Sweaty Betty's (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/sweaty-bettys-toronto), but we also have a newly-opened restaurant that serves up dandy food in the form of Delux.

One of the fun things about Delux is that you need to know its there in order to find it.  Hiding on Ossington doesn't really help, and neither does a street sign with a single arrow pointing to the door, unless you know where you're going.  Your ability to find the place will be a rich reward.  No worries.  Once your in, you're taken away from the albeit roughness of Ossington to a modern monochromatic dining area.  Seating is ample, and the food rich and well plated.  I ended up ordering the duck off the menu upon recommendation by the servers and was anything but disappointed.  The freshness of the ingredients is showcased prominently in the resultant dishes.

The wine list is ample.  The post-supper liquors and liqueurs are sufficient.  The restaurant as a whole is so inviting it can easily be the focus of the evening instead of a part of a larger night.  Worth fighting your way down Ossington for.
