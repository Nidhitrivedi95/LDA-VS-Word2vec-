rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A What a huge disappointment.  My husband and I stayed at The Venetian and heard good things about Bouchon so we thought we'd give it a try for our one year anniversary dinner.  What a mistake that was!   I ordered the skate and my husband had the steak frites; both were WAY too salty/overseasoned - almost to the point where his steak was not edible.  My skate was bland, albeit too salty, and seenmed soggy in the center but dry on the outside.  I ordered the potato puree side which could have used MORE seasoning as it was very bland.   As I mentioned, my husband's steak was way way too salty and, frankly, the cut of meat was not good.  

We did order a pork & shiitake mushroom appetizer which was actually very good so I was surprised with the poor quality of our entrees.

On a positive note, our server was very attentive and  provided great service.

Overall, I was very disappointed with the quality of food at Bouchon.  I would not return.
