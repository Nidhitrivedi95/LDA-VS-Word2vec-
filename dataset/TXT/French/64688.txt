teTQU7TIPE0O_B1zN_239w To be honest, the food wasn't that great. The service however was on point! Nemi was very attentive and had the best attitude! She always had a smile on her face and made sure our drinks and bread were full. She even offered us to-go drinks at check out which made my whole day. Such a little thing can make a huge impact. I would consider trying this place again just because of her :))
