QlSpPzc4Oy05ic-PsoYH4g Visiting Pittsburgh for one day and decided to skip my usual fast food run for a great local restaurant. Found Streets on Carson thanks to Yelp. Warm, friendly, welcoming staff and vibe. Had the samosa appetizer followed by Cuban sandwich.  Holy cow what great food!  The best Cuban sandwich I've had in years!
