rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw BEST. FRENCH. TOAST. EVER. Came to Bardot on New Year's Day in definite need of some carbohydrates after NYE on the strip. Our waiter was extremely kind and charismatic, despite the rather long wait for items. Restaurant is beautiful, with perhaps one of the most beautiful bars on the strip. Everyone enjoyed their food tremendously. For those who enjoy bread and butter, definitely recommend the beurre déchiré. SO tasty. The eggs Benedict, burger, croque madame and hunter's waffle were all extremely tasty. The real star of the show however was their french toast. My husband will usually never eat french toast, waffles or pancakes without extra syrup. The almond/orange syrup offered with the meal made him forget what table syrup was! Only regret we had was not having big enough stomachs to also order the Nutella sticky bun. Next time!!!
