The restaurant is beautifully designed, its new, cool, lots of young wealthy people hanging around, and a bunch of babes that work there.

Upstairs it's a little quieter and private- we were coming in with a group of 12 and placed upstairs by the bathrooms (not great) but were moved to another table over looking the downstairs of the restaurant.

For the most part people were ordering surf+turf which was presented as you'd expect (it had better be @ 80$ a plate) and came with a little bit of lobster, a filet with mashed potato, and some scallops. 

I think our waiter had the feeling this was going to be one of those "expense your business" dinners and was a little pushy with the wine suggestions. One person wanted a glass of Port but instead he brought out a bottle of desert wine insisting we have that instead- of course the majority of the table jumped on that bandwagon  and he pops it quickly (oh look...it was 375$). The type of stuff that would really drive me nuts if I was paying with my own dough. That doesn't make it OK, though.

We had also called ahead and left a CC number for the meal to be charged to - but the restaurant didn't know how to place the charge without having the physical card there. They said they couldn't do it- but obviously they could....so it just took them apprx. 30 minutes to figure out how.

The meal itself was delicious in every regard - diners just need to be diligent and make sure things don't get too out of hand with those drinks!
