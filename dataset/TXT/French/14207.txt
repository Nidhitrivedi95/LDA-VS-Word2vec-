58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw Had a poached egg and duck brunch. 
The plate was exquisite, service was top notch and the ambiance was excellent. 

Just what the doctor ordered. And everyone that works here is a professional. That's quite rare. 

To top it off, the quality you get for the price is probably unique in MTL for breakfast/brunch. 

Healthy and more more decadent options are available, the coffee is great and the staff is friendly. 

Posted this while still seated. 

Must try.
