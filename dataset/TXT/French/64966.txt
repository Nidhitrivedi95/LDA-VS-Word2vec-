Tl2nqtPXlLbAG3qkUYVM2g THE BEST OMELETTE I'VE EVER HAD!!!!

Saturday Brunch Review.

You can custom make your own omelette. My friend who is a regular ordered mine for me. Her concoction consisted of bacon, ham, cheese, sun dried tomatoes, fresh basil, and pesto.  Wow, it was hands-down the best omelette I've ever had.The price was reasonable at about $10.

The next time I'm back visiting Phoenix, Vincent's On Camelback is on my list of places to re-visit..
