0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g This restaurant was fantastic I had a great experience I want to start off by saying that you have to make sure that you get seated outside of the restaurant. they have a seating where you can see the Bellagio water show while you're eating. Best seat in the house. 

Inside of the restaurant it's also very luxurious but you can find this kind of luxurious places in other places. I definitely don't think it's worth staying inside. However there is one thing that separates this luxury restaurants from others. There are real Picasso paintings in the restaurant. 

The experience of sitting in front of the water fountain enjoying a Michelin 2 star restaurant was fantastic. 

We ordered the five course meal. The foie gras was fantastic. Size is pretty big for it to be in a tasting menu. It is $128 per person for a tasting menu. 

I feel that I would come back but only if I get seated outside. 

The food it pretty good. I didn't find it to be super spectacular or anything. Still deserves 5 stars. 

When you leave the restaurant they give you a muffin in a nice Picasso packaged box.
