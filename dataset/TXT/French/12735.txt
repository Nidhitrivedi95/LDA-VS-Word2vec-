Came here with my mom, sister and niece based on high recommendations from hubby.  

They had a sangria that was so tasty that my sis and I finished the whole pitcher!

Their hand cut frites are to die for!  Like nothing I ever had.  Their steak with butter was not too bad.  Mom ordered the duck l'orange which she loved.  Niece couldn't stop talking about the french onion soup and escargots she had.
