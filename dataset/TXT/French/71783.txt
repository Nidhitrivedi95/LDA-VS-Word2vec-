xeFVRUjxorxjO_qjX8FNdw Nice little spot for lunch or a coffee/dessert.

I went today for lunch and had the Greek salad to start and the arctic char entree. The Greek salad had a raspberry vinegrette which was a little odd (I think it was just their regular mixed green salad topped with feta and olives) but it still tasted good. The arctic char was well cooked and tasted great. And this is coming from a guy that's not the biggest fan of fish.

My GF had the sweet potato and spinach soup to start and the veal cutlet entree. The soup was delicious and the veal, while a tad salty, was also very good. Portion sizes were good - so good in fact that we didn't have room to try one of their delicious looking desserts. Prices were decent as well.
