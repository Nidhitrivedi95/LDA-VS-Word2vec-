Yp1swb-8pO8i-6-jaK2tsA The low calorie breakfasts sure taste good! But I dont know if I like the calorie count being displayed or not, because when I order from another section of the menu, I feel guilty =)

Still love their muffins and their breakfast items. The soup and sandwich lunch combos are always tasty and their iced coffee comes in cool looking tall glasses. Kids meals are reasonable and I like that they have side options like fruit, instead of just french fries.

Definitely want to try Mimi's for Sunday brunch.
