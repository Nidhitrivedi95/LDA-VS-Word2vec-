6fPQJq4f_yiq1NHn0fd11Q I ordered the St. Louis (ham, cheese, and basil) savory crepe.  Unfortunately, I wasn't impressed.  My crepe was too thick and the ham was all where the fold of the crepe was.  There wasn't a lot of ham either, and it tasted like supermarket deli ham.  Maybe their sweet crepes are better.
