qmh6zxtJ8C8-YiUPv7ySlw I tried this restaurant a very long time ago, so I'm not sure how the food is now, but when I went in 2005 the food wasn't what I expected from a Daniel Boulud restaurant. Living in NYC, he's a demi-god when it comes to food, but he obviously wasn't in the kitchen (I checked), and the food wasn't all that memorable.

We ordered a few of the more French dishes like crispy duck and I believe the chicken. Again I expected a bit more, but then again expectations are always high at a Daniel restaurant. Next time I go I'll have to check out the prix-fixe special as well as the famed burger that I might just go to the one in NY for.
