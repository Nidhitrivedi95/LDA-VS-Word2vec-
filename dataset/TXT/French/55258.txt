rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A It was between Bouchon and Aureole for dinner and we chose Bouchon based on the yelp reviews. Wish we hadn't.

It was a loud experience, they were out of the dinner special, we waited an inordinate amount of time for our entree,  and nothing about the food was particularly memorable.  We have had better french bistro food from Bistro Du Coin in Washington DC then we had at this supposed "Five-Star Vegas Restaurant". 

The food is pricey for what you receive, and nothing on the menu is particularly impressive. Save your money and go somewhere else.
