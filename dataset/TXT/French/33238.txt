hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA I love this little cafe.  Not only are the salads with homemade dressing fabulous but the quiche, soups and panini sandwiches very good as well.  The croissants and other pastries are wonderful.  The only downside is they are closed on weekends.  This little cafe is located in a strip mall within a mid rise business park thus the reason it is only open weekends.  Outside seating is a nice feature as well for breakfast or lunch.
