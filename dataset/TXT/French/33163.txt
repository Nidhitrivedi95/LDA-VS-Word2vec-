HiMb8cwGsnFVwYxt1h0RCg You can trust Bistro Tôt ou Tard to provide a filling, delicious brunch at a reasonable price.  Thanks to yelp, I first visited this restaurant last summer and returned this weekend with some friends.  It is located on the first floor of an office building across the street from Parc La Fountain.  There is an outdoor patio for the warmer months.  Both times I visited I ordered the  Breakfast "Chez Nous," which has potatoes, bacon, sausage, ham, and cheese curds.  As it is listed on the menu, it comes with poached eggs and Hollandaise sauce (listed as "Dutch sauce" on the English menu), but I asked for scrambled eggs and no sauce and they were happy to comply.  All of their brunch offerings come with a baguette, bottomless coffee or black tea, as well as a large bowl with a variety of fresh fruits.  Our server was friendly and attentive, though we did have to ask for coffee refills.  They also have espresso and a variety of lunch options, but with such big brunches for only around $13, I have yet to move past the first page on the menu.  Definitely a brunch winner!
