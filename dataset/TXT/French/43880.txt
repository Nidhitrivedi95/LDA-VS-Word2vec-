m9aFZk1f8tSv248YErbpQA Met up with a friend for branch at this lovely little gem on Saturday morning.  I had my 16 months old baby girl with me.  Upon entering, the staff welcomed us with warm and genuine smile!  Everything we tried was to die for, and the service was impeccable!  Our coffee cups were never less than 1/2 empty because they kept refilling them.  One very friendly lady staff kept bringing toys to my daughter so she wouldn't get bored!  The best part was not even once they rushed us out, which allowed us to enjoy the food and catch up with each other.  Amazing place!!  I cannot wait to return!!
