USleI8g1UVN9-9jm-b4uIg Favorite restaurant in Charlotte! If we could afford it, we'd eat here every week...lol. Best filet I've ever had....for real. Best service I ever had. Best ambiance. A true meal to remember....no joke. Take someone you love & be prepared to spend like 2 bills...it's worth every penny.
