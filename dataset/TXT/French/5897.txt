3rj1qpgFvkRWtAka17mhEQ Had breakfast and it was good. Had eggs Benedict and was ok. Hollandaise sauce was cold but other than that very food. Had a kids pancake that looked like a dog and she loved it. The breakfast tacos were very very dry but she said we're tasty. Orange juice was warm, should of been ice cold in my opinion. Staff and service was good with no complaints. Won't make it our favorite breakfast place but I'm sure we will be back.
