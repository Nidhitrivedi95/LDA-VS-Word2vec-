SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA This place is delicious for French food this side of the pond.  I have only been here once but everything I tasted was top notch...right down to the sea salt and olive oil they serve with the bread before the entree.

I had the cassoulet (braised white beans with lamb, duck confit and sausages) which was absolutely perfect.

If I lived in Cleveland (my husband is from there), I would frequent this French gem on a regular basis...the entire menu sounds delicious, the atmosphere is relaxing yet contemporary, and the service is excellent.
