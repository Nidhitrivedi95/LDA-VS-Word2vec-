gh6__q2WXFuyN8gt6VAnWw This restaurant is delightfully enchanting. It doesn't look like much from outside, but step in the door and you'll feel as though you've just stepped into a 5 star restaurant. The owners are extremely friendly and treat you like family from the moment you arrive introducing themselves with a friendly smile and warm hug. The food is exceptional and underpriced for it's worth. I absolutely love this place and would recommend to anyone willing to take a chance on an unassuming night out with a loved one...even better they have live musical talent. Love it.
