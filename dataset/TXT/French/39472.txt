jT-KFrbwr5iE-_vrVLpmiw I love Beiruti Grand Café.  The neighbourhood was in dire need of a good gathering place.  You can meet your friends for coffee and deserts or have a bite to eat.  Everything is delicious and beautifully presented.  I haven't had a bad meal or desert yet.  It's become my "go to" stop for lunch for a delicious and healthy meal - and I never leave there feeling guilty about what I ate - it's all good for you and prepared with quality ingredients.  I used to grab my lunch at Pusateri's in Bayview Village and now I drive the extra 5 mins and get a much better quality lunch!  

It's open for dinner too so I find myself picking up dinner a couple of times a week when I am looking for something light and healthy and I will often meet up with friends for coffee and deserts on weekends or evenings. 

My favourites; the double smoked trout salad, the lamb sandwich, the steak sandwich, the Beiruti chicken....pretty much everything I have tried has been delicious - you can't go wrong!  And the coffee is amazing!  Favourite breakfast item:  egg white omelet and multigrain croissant, although the manaeesh (thyme flat bread) is really good too. 

For anyone who eats lunch out, the prices are in line with (if not better than) what you would find at other cafe's or stores (like Pusaterie's or McEwan's) and I find the salads and sandwiches much, much better at Beiruti.  

Can't wait for more menu items to be added.
