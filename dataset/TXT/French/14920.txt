5fquJHY2hMX9tPRD5s0t5g You may have figured out by now that I have "parking issues". So, kudos that on this rainy, cold evening I could park in the garage that is RIGHT THERE and not have to get wet to get to the restaurant. (Pull in off of College). 
The hostess at the door was great and we decided to have a cocktail before going to our table as we were a little early. Unfortunately, that is really the only ding of the evening. We ordered Bulleit Rye Manhattans and they were cloyingly sweet. So sweet I asked the bartender if she added cherry juice (as they were slightly red, too). She said no, so I assume the sweet vermouth ratios were off. 
We had dinner upstairs. (We sat in a booth and the partition next to my head was so dusty it looked hairy...yech)
They have a great charcuterie menu! I will have to come back with multiple carnivores to get a good experience with this, but unfortunately this trip my pescatarian friend wasn't into that. 
No more criticisms from here on out. I had short ribs and mushrooms and my friend had scallops and wilted spinach. Perhaps too much butter on the veggies, but the short rib was fall-apart tender, and the scallops (served on a beet puree)were just the right size, with a nice sear on the outside. 
I asked for a validation for parking on the way out and I thought she said it would still be $2. When I left the garage, I paid $4, so maybe she meant $2 off. I don't give a damn, I would have paid more for valet- I just was happy not to have to walk in the rain.
