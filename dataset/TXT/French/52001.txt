pmoIMK8zGWvKsVOPDBYfzg Food was excellent (dessert was nothing special) but the service was lacking.  Waited wasn't as sharp as I expected on the menu and I didn't like the casual up selling. "Would you like to try caviar appetizer?" Sure. I actually thought they meant a bite like an amuse... No mention of price and it's not on the menu.  Then it's $140 on the bill. Make sure you ask clearly how much everything is because they don't tell you otherwise. The entire  tasting menu was less than a small bit of caviar. That's crazy.  Manager didn't seem interested in resolving it either.
