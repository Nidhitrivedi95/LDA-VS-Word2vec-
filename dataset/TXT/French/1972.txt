0KbcIOCoDrIaBPx9hfoXcQ We found this place while wandering around looking for somewhere to eat dinner. I kept checking my Yelp app. and realised that most restaurants in the neighbourhood seemed to be closed on Mondays. To be honest, we didn't really have high expectations as Scandinavian food usually isn't something we'd choose. We decided to give it a try mostly because we were hungry and didn't hold out much hope of finding something else open close by.

We were seated right away and brought menus. We ordered calamari (they forgot about that order, so we didn't actually get it) and 2 kinds of tartare. We also ordered a bottle of wine which was no longer available but the waiter offered another in its place (sauvignon blanc) and it was delicious. Our son ordered a cola from the menu which was also no longer available, but was brought a local cola instead and he loved it so much that we messaged the company to ask where we can buy it.

My son and I each had the beef tartare. He had it mild and I had it spicy. It was served with a few slices of crisp, grilled bread, salad and frites on the side. The tartare was delicious and perfectly seasoned. The salad was made from mixed greens, radish, cucumber and tomato and the dressing was perfectly balanced. The frites were the best we've had in Montréal (we've been here for a week and have tried many). 

My husband had the salmon tartare, which was also perfectly seasoned and he agreed that the salad and frites were wonderful.

The prices were very reasonable and the serving sizes were generous.

The waiter and waitress who served us were friendly and efficient.

All in all, this was a great experience and we'd definitely be back if weren't leaving Montréal tomorrow.
