Da6eZFThE9xanUAGNpZxAg Decided to come in late friday night for a small bite to eat, and what better than sharing charcuterie boards and a few drinks. Located just a block away from the ever so popular Drake Hotel, we came into this little restaurant unsure we would be leaving knowing that we'd definitely be coming back. 

First and for most, the food. 

What we ordered on the charcuterie board:
Meat- Chorizo Iberico, Prosciutto, Coppa 
Cheese-Vermeer, Bellavitano Merlot Sartori, Taleggio(if you're looking for mild flavoured cheese, these were the best options!)
Olives-Mykonos(to die for), Fire Olives, Cerignol

Each and every pairing of cheese to meat to olives were outstanding. And it actually left us full at the end of the night to our surprise! 

Plus an order of Crispy Calamari that was cooked to perfection and delicious. 

To top off the night, our server was extremely helpful and knowledgable. She stayed attentive and regularly checked up on us, and always made sure we had drinks ect..

Perfect evening that exceeded our expectations. Will be back!
