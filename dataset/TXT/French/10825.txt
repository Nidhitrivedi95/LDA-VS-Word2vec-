4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Oh my god!  This is one of the best places I've experienced in Las Vegas.  The outside seating has a great view of the Bellagio water show and was pleasant to sit in even during a slightly cool night in February.  The bread and carrot salad was great and our waitress was phenomenal with a cute accent.  The food was also good and the Bananas Foster Crepe was delicious, a shame I had to share with two coworkers.
