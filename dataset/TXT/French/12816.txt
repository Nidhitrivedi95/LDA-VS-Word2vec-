4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I ate here this past weekend, was extremely delicious. I ordered the smoked salmon I believe & my oh my was it DELICIOUS. I forgot the waitresses name but it was the blonde older lady and her name started with a C. She was so nice & made the experience delightful. She explained the foods, didn't bother us, and was just so darn nice! I'm rating 4 stars because when my family and I first arrived, my cousins and I had gone to use the restroom. While we were in the restroom, the rest of my family were already being called to be seated. Normally this is never an issue at ANY restaraunt I have gone too, but maybe this restaraunt is bougie enough to make a big deal out of it. My cousin calls us and tells us to hurry so we rush over. As I'm walking in, 2 hostess' (both young ladies with black hair) were saying "why would you come to a restaraunt if the whole party isn't here" and throwing unnecessary comments around. I normally would've said something but I wasn't informed on the drama until I sat down with my family. That's when they told me that the ladies were causing an issue because a few of us were in the restroom and even tried testing my aunt saying "do you even know where the restroom is?" That's when I remembered the ladies talking. We spoke to the manager about it and she didn't do anything. I wish I would've got the young girls' name because this is a tourist spot. It was my first time but my aunt goes a lot. If it weren't for the good food and great service from our waitress, I would leave 1 star because those ladies from the start made us feel less than what we were.
