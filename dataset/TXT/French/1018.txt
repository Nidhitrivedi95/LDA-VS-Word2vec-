_cjPEH9wXhKS-HQe_U3M4Q SO good. I remembered it fondly from way back when they were on Queen St. Foie Gras, Boudin Noir, Steak Frites, Onion soup, creme brulee. A few glasses of Bordeaux and another of port. Outstanding...all of them. Despite the button down atmosphere, they were super sweet to the kids, gave us a great table with no Reservation,
