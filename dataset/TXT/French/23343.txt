C6hljmEZYZw4pA0OJaFOjQ I came to Café Marlayne as part of a fairly large party.  We were seated at an "L" shaped table, which meant that some of us had our backs to the group.

The food was AOK; I had a pretty bland vegetable curry.  The menu said it came with homemade Nan, but when it arrived it actually came with a store-bought tortilla.  My friend ordered the salmon, which came in such a small portion that he could easily have dropped it into his eye...

If anyone from the restaurant is reading this, I suggest that the menu state plainly that all sides must be ordered separately to avoid confusion.

On the upside, the pudding was delicious!
