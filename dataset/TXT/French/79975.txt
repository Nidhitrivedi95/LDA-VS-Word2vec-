ZuYsZvJ5r32Fs70vPXbRgw We had a good rabbit ravioli here over a year ago for dinner. I don't see it on their current menu... hope they bring it back.

From my notes on opentable, I wrote "The waiters/waitresses did not make good suggestions on the food though... I feel like sometimes they're just trying to get us to spend more." Sorta left us with a bad feeling, but meh.
