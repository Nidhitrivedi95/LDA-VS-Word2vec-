12sgLRzQWzYwHX8ROXBnLw Such a sweet little jewel box of a restaurant. Maybe not quite 5 Stars compared to Aizle, Martin Wish art and the other usual suspects in town, but beautifully prepared dishes with lovely service and a thoughtful wine list. 

Initially The Rabbit Hole had more of an Italian inflection to the food but it seems to have shifted more towards French. Either way, well done. 

Very high quality, fresh and well prepared seafood. I've had delicately cooked scallops, a smoked haddock Scotch egg with a perfectly oozy center...and those were just starters! 

Some outstanding wild game and more unusual meats such as quail and squab. I had what was probably some of the best calves liver I've ever enjoyed. If you're a meat lover, this is a great stop. Also several good selections for vegetarians. 

If you're in the area for lunch, The Rabbit Hole also offers a creative and well priced lunch set menu. It'll offer familiar favorites like steak frites, but also some of the more creative a la carte items. Including desserts!

Prices are a little high compared to some other restaurants in the area, but portions are generous and most importantly the food quality is worth it. 

With such a small space and patrons enjoying relaxing, lingering meals, I'd have to speculate no one here is getting rich and the head chef genuinely loves his work.

The food is mostly quite rich, hearty and filling. Although there are a few lovely lighter options like a beautiful fish cooked en papillote (wrapped in parchment then oven roasted) with veg. 

Great option for a romantic dinner or out with friends. They even have a wee children's menu, though I have yet to see any children there. 

Give it a go on your next special night out, or just try popping by if you're in the neighbourhood!
