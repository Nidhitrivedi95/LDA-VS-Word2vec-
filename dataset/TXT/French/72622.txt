XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q Wow! What can I say but wow! My husband and I celebrated our 1-year wedding anniversary by having dinner here. The food was delicious and very pricey for two normal people like ourselves.

I ordered the rib eye steak with bell peppers and spinach in a wasabi sauce and dark chocolate souffle for dessert. My husband ordered the lobster dish with some stuffed seafood items. These aren't your regular portions, they are smaller but very filling. They offer a great selection of breads and after dinner chocolates. They also gave us the most decadent, buttery, creamy mashed potatoes I have ever had!

The staff was nice enough but a bit stiff. Our waiter was really friendly and made me feel more welcome. Thanks! Watching the staff was like watching a choreographed dance. They even took our coats and scarves! 

At the end of the night we were given a bag with chocolate and a mini book with pictures of the restaurant. Overall the food was delicious and we enjoyed ourselves but at about $500 for 2 people I'm afraid we can't afford to come back. If we win the lottery we'll be back :)
