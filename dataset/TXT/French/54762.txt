rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw Great food, atmosphere, service and drinks. I'm not much of a 'yelper' but because of my experience here, and the fact that there is so much restaurant 'noise' in Las Vegas, I felt it was warranted. I've been to Vegas a ton of times, and have eaten in most of the high end places. I've eaten in many Michael Mina restaurants around the country as well. This time, I was here for a national sales meeting and had dinner at Bardot with my team of 12 from across the country. When I plan group dinners I prefer a prix fix as it's easier on everyone, and on my budget. Bardot had a great choice of menus in multiple price points that featured main courses that are high on the normal menu. Everything was great and everyone enjoyed their meals. What really set Bardot apart for me was in the service. Of course, we all enjoyed the food but for a 3 month old restaurant in Vegas, where there is so much transient help, I was impressed. I eat a vegan diet and also love to eat. In NY it's easy to eat where there are many inventive chefs and I'm not just getting a salad...in other places, it is hit or miss. At Bardot I got a great meal of multiple courses that followed the rest of the group. My dishes were plentiful in variety of ingredients and prepared quite well. Our entire service team, led by John Paul was great. He was attentive and responsive, timely and traditional in service. Explaining my vegan meal and the point of view of the chef de cuisine, which was greatly appreciated. Even after multiple rounds of champagne, wine and cocktails, managing a group of 12 women after all day meetings in Vegas, was easy for them all.  I will be back at the end of June and will visit again. We all enjoyed our experience (vegan and foie gras lovers alike) and would highly recommend Bardot.
