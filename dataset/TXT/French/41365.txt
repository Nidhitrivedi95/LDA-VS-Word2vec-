I had the duck confit which was tasty and fall-off-the-bone.  Ice cream for dessert which was unique and flavourful.  We've eaten in the bar area previously which I haven't enjoyed.  Something about the design and lighting.  The dining room, however, works well.  Service was quite good.  Plus, we benefitted from a manager who was really working the room and solicitous.
