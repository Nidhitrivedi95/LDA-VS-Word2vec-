T4shscbr3BU3yb6EA3BSfA Book in advance because this place is great, the food was incredible and fresh. The service was excellent, the waiters are really helpful and will find the perfect thing for you to order. Definitely a place to check out in MTL. Only thing is portions are really small, so if you're looking to be filled up this isn't the place.
