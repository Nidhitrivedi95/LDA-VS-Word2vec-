Do they microwave everything?  What's the hurry?  We had to send them back and ask for our appetizer first. The fish was dry and the short ribs were like mashed potatoes - obviously over cooked. The waiter wanted to argue with us after we told him about the food quality, with no apology.  A very disappointing and unpleasant dining experience.
