4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I had breakfast here with my 2 daughters this past Wednesday.  We sat in the garden room, which had a great view and was very comfortable!  The food was delicious and they had a variety of gluten-free options.  My only wish was they had given me something else on my plate, in addition to the eggs Benedict and cherry tomatoes.  Perhaps fruit or potatoes would have been a nice addition.
