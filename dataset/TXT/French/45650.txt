mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q I have been to many michelin star restaurants and am a complete foodie.  I thought the meal here was enjoyable but nothing made me think 'amazing'.  The gazpacho was very good, the bread was a bit to hard, the ceviche was ok/good, and the beef carpaccio was oversalted so much that I couldn't finish it (and it was an additional $15 in cost to the standard tasting menu price).  Maybe it was oversalted to ensure that we buy another bottle of evian at $10.  I was asked if I wanted sparking or still water and said still but didnt expect a bottle of evian to be opened up and charged to my bill.  Then towards the end of my meal the waiter asked if I wanted another bottle of evian and when I said no, he poured tap water into my glass already half full with evian... not that I care so much but that was not appropriate.  I almost took $10 off the tip to pay for the bottle that I was forced to purchase.  I wouldnt go back with so many other great restaurants in LV and many at lower price points than here.
