I can only imagine that Vegas must be a playground for interior designers because there's no shortage of creativity and this place doesn't disappoint.  I was impressed upon walking in and the one thing you can't miss as you proceed into the main dining area is the view.  If you don't sit out on the balcony for your meal, at least head out before you leave.  It's definitely a nice picture opportunity.  

The service was prompt as we were quickly attended to.  We enjoyed the specialty drinks, I had the Prohibition Punch, and the entrees were delicious too.  I personally tried the trout with almonds and it was pretty tasty.  

Overall our experience was positive and I would certainly return here on my next visit.
