Dcj69NZJnbJhK-YHP_nULA I've been going to this place pretty regularly since I moved here 4 years ago. I mostly come here for the drinks; their beer list is out of this world. I think I owe my current love of beer (certainly my love of sours) to living a block from this restaurant and exploring their extensive (and ever changing) beer list for the past two years. Now they offer 4oz pours from their tap list in addition to full size, which is great for the indecisive among us. For non-beer drinkers the wine menu has never disappointed either.

I can't speak for the entrees, but have enjoyed the porcini fries and v-burger several times. I'm still bitter they removed my favorite sandwich (I miss you caprese sandwich!!) but the turkey sandwich is another solid choice.

Basically, if you like beer, you've gotta check it out.
