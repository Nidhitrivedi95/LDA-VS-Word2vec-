XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q Simply, the most luxurious dining experience I've ever had. From the ridiculous carts of bread and mignardises, to the over the top amuse of caviar and crab... everything was absolutely wonderful. Amazing that a dining experience like this is literally 10 steps away from the cigarette smoke, glitter, and "glamour" of the MGM casino. 

Favorites on the night I dined:

Les Champignons - Crispy toast topped with black truffles, trembling parsley chicken royal w/ gold leaf, and ginger matsutake tea w/ black truffles

La Châtaigne - Delicate chestnut velouté with foie gras, smoked lardons foam

Les Crustacés - Langoustine in a filo crust, Uni on mashed potato with roasted coffee beans, Roast Lobster tail w/ lemongrass 

La Sphère de Sucre (which was requested, not on menu) - Sugar sphere filled with mascarpone mousse, Limoncello marshmallow, and a stratification of surprises from childhood
