LjOBNcNNpuewBqSPxYYTJQ I have been to this location several times and am sad to say that I have left unhappy each time.Why do I keep going back you ask? Perhaps I'm a glutton for punishment, or the allure of it being 10 minutes from my house is tempting compared to the 40 minute trip to Noda. Either way I have decided not to return. My first encounter was the grand opening, it was decent enough to try again. The next time it was my birthday and I placed an order for a cake two weeks in advance....when I go in to pick it up they don't have it. They were not apologetic in the least nor did they offer to fix their mistake. Simply unorganized and unprofessional. The next time I got coconut macaroons and a salted Caramel blabla coffee. Waited 15min for it yet it still tasted like straight ocean water. It's not supposed to taste like burnt salty tap water. Went again tonight, the case was practically empty, staff was rude, the dining area was filthy. Staff performing closing duties and mopping at 7:40! Not even going to touch on the lack of quality of the pastries purchased. Coffee was trash once again. The store is staffed with angst filled teenagers who are too cool to be there. Have heard employees talking smack about management/bakery staff every time I've been here. I am truly confused as to how poorly this location is being run. And frankly appalled. They need to do better. 0/10 wouldn't recommend. It's a no from from me.
