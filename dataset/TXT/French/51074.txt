P2g6xo5vZSEeGSr9tftLeg My husband and I were visiting my family for the holidays from San Francisco and he LOVES his beef tartare, he keeps talking about the magical beef tartare he ate in Quebec City and there was no way I was driving 3 hrs to eat raw meat, so this was the next best thing, what's better than a tartare bar?! We went with my sister and this is tartare galore- my husband was thrilled! I love the atmosphere, trendy and modern and if I still lived in Montreal, I would definitely come here for drinks since all my old hot spots are now invaded by minors, we ordered the seafood and meat tartare tasting platter, 4 people could easily eat this, I also ordered the fries. Everything was excellent! Some were savoury, some were salty, loved the deer and duck tartare best. Yelpers mentioned the high cost but I thought the pricing was pretty reasonable. I would definitely go back.
