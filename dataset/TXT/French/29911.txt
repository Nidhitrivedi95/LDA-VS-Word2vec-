fKDyiIcFLkl-_5d4JsvBXA I visited the Quebec City outpost of this restaurant (not sure if they are affiliated?) and was very happy there, so I was excited to see how they do steak frites in Montreal.
Location cannot be beat, it's right beside Peel metro station, and there is a summertime terrase with a view of Mont Royal up the street. We sat inside and enjoyed the ambient French background music.
Menu is very small here, you really only have the choice of the larger steak combo with salad and soup, or the smaller one with only one of the above. Unfortunately no appetizers like the location in Quebec City - I was sad because I do enjoy the chicken liver mousse up there.
Salad: We all got the full-leaf salad with dressing and walnuts, and this was the same excellent quality as up in QC. 
Steak: I love the sirloin cut here, it's very thin with a soft inside, and the outside is not charred. Very delicate texture. Same quality as QC, however the mustard sauce here is better than in QC in my opinion! Rather than distracting you from the flavor of steak, it actually enhances the light delicate flavor and provides you with a mouthful of juice in each bite.
Fries: Matchstick as per their tradition, very delicately fried and not dripping with grease or salt. These are some of the lightest tasting fries I've ever had and I loved them.
Service: Our waitress was not very conversational and very to-the-point, which is where this location seems to fall short of the QC outpost. Loved the French maid outfit though.
Overall I'm quite impressed with this place, having visited it along with the QC location! I'd happily recommend both, and give higher points to the MTL location for the flavor of the steak sauce. Bon appetit, friends.
