4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw So disappointing. Good food but the waitress was clearly annoyed that she had to work that night..we had to ask for everything more than once .. But then she was pleasant when she gave us the bill.  So many more fun interesting and "wonderful service" restaurants in Las Vegas .. For $100 appetizer drink and main plate not worth the experience ..
