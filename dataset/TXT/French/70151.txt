wwgRu0TAMX8rfRhsiI0ifQ Sometimes you take a chance on a dish and it turns out to be one of the better meals you've had in a while. Was craving carbonara and it's not on the menu but the chef was nice enough to make it for me. They did not skimp on the pancetta and this dish has a little kick to it..This dish satisfied my cravings.. It's a must try..
