mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q I should have written my review right after i ate here cuz i can't remember the details now.  We went Dec 13, 2008.  Had the full tasting menu with champagne.  On the memorable side: Oysters, Langostine, and creamy pumpkin soup.  Overall it was really good for the price.   You could easily spend twice as much next door at Joel Robuchon.   I was telling Emmanuel the GM that I did enjoy it much more than La Bernadin in NYC.    For fine dining in Vegas for good value, I'll have to say it was a similar experience to Rosemary's except you pay a little more for being on the strip.  Where Rosemary was more down to earth and homely, L'atelier was all slick and classy.  Definitely get counter seating as you get to interact with the prep staff more.  Oh yeah...mini baguettes were AWESOME!
