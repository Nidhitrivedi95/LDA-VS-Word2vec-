I had the truffle onion soup and filet mignon with pureed potato.  The steak was amazing, probably one of the best ever (and I do go to the range of steakhouses).  The truffle onion soup was good but not amazing.

My fiance had the mac'n'cheese.  By far, one of the best "dressed-up" comfort food I have ever had.  The texture of the cheese (crispy and a little gritty at the top) was so unique and with the truffle oil, it was exquisite.  He also got the salmon, which was good, but no match for my steak.

I also had some other stuff that was forgettable, but the place gets 5 starts for the steak and mac'n'cheese.  Also a special bonus, the waiter brought out complementary little tasters that the chef had cooked up.  We also go dessert with the pre-fixed menu, but we were both so full!
