4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw We had a bunch of friends meet at this restaurant to eat. 

I was really excited to plan a work get together. The place is very elegant with a lot of charm. It is next to the belagio water fountain. I personally had my back to it but that was ok. We all had a good time.


Food Many of us had seafood had really had a great experience. The fish was fresh and not overcooked. 
Some had scallops and was not bad .

We did not order drink but I bet it have been greeat. 
The atmosphere was chic and it could definitely could be a romantic spot. 

Honestly the food was very reasonable with most dishes 30-$40

All the guests were happy .
