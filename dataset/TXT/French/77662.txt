YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g I'm gonna judge Fleur a bit hard. Because it's Hubert Keller. He's supposed to be awesome. This evening was only alright. 

seared foie gras - it's a good dish. it's just between the foie gras, the mushroom and the sauce, it wasn't quite balanced. either you taste this or that. Not together.

monkfish liver pate - this had a variety of different tastes incorporated. I liked it but I didnt love it. 

braised short ribs - this was a solid dish. I can see why it's loved by so many patrons. Call me a snob but it's a great dish only for the unadventurous. Any good restaurant should be able to produce a dish like this. 

lobster mac n cheese - the highlight of the evening. It was creamy. The lobster was relevant. The texture was good. 

Service was above and beyond. Our waitress went around and asked her fellow coworker for recommendation on brunch for us. That was very nice of her. And she recommended a Malbec that went really well with our dishes. A+ on service. Not blown away on the food.
