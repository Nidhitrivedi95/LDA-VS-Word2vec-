aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw Stopped here on the way out after seeing the Blue Man Group, as I wanted to get my husband some pastries for breakfast tomorrow.  I bought 2 chocolate croissants and 2 cheese danishes.  

My husband thought the chocolate croissants at the M resort (Babycakes) were better, but admittedly I liked these better from Bouchon.  But as I'm not really a huge sugar eater and spend more time tasting and buying for my husband, his opinion counts more than mine!  The cheese danishes were odd, but not in a bad way.  It was almost like they were baked like the croissants, and flaky in the same way.   I personally liked these better than the croissants.

If I'm at the Venetian again, since I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, I'll try the macaroons.
