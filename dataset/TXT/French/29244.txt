eUjDWzbQ6eLZy0uELEOa9Q Went here for a friend's party.  While the place has nice ambiance, our waiter was attitude central and made it seem like he definitely did not want to be serving a party of 20.  He would avoid eye contact with us when we were trying to get his attention to order drinks.  We would order, and it would take about 20 minutes to receive our pints.  This would be understandable if it was jumping, but there was hardly anyone in the restaurant or outside.  My roommate's latte arrived cold and he acted like he was doing her the biggest favor when she sent it back.  She got another one quickly, this one scalding hot.  Nice one.  Another friend and I decided to order food, which arrived about 45 minutes after we ordered it.  My poutine was cold, the gravy congealed, and there was maybe one cheese curd in it.  My friend's chicken wings tasted like fish and chips.  

When we got the bill, he didn't bother to include gratuity in a party of twenty.  He also tried charging two of my friends extra drinks they didn't order, and tried to charge me for the beer I ordered, but he messed up (brought me the wrong one).  

I'd perhaps give this place another go it I was down in the area, as it could very well be that it was just this waiter's attitude that ruined it for me, but I will definitely not be making any special trips to The Boiler House any time soon.
