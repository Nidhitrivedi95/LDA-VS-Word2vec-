nkHaix6KenApS8M-liZsCQ Stopped in tonight with a friend and enjoyed a truly fabulous meal. 

Amuse-bouche: Smoked Salmon on an edible cracker shaped spoon - truly brilliant! 

Appetizers: Butter poached Lobster with golden beets on a bed of lettuce & Chilled pea soup
Christopher's crusty French bread served with soft, sweet butter is always appreciated and forever addictive!

Main Courses: Hanger steak medium rare with pommes frites
Butter poached Lobster salad with golden beets (yes, it was so good it was ordered TWICE!!!) 

Desserts: Chocolate mousse tower & Lemon tart with lemon sorbet

Christopher's has been a consistent "perfect 10" with us for many, many years as we've been coming to Camelback & 24th Street since the 90's. We know that we can stop in anytime to have a wonderful meal. Tonight was no exception. What more can we say ... How about this? 
Move over Donald & Hillary - 
Christopher for President in 2016! He'll get things done with style to spare.
