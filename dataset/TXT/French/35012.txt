HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw I came here with my best friend for a quick lunch. As we walked around the Cosmopolitan hotel we were trying to find a place to eat. My best friend suggested we try Comme Ca, but he also warned me that they take forever!

When we got in, it was pretty empty, not that many people were sitting inside and it did seem like it was a slightly older crowd inside. Anyway, we were told to sit wherever we wanted. So we found a small table and sat down. I feel like service could have been better, we had to wait a while before the server came to take our drink order, I had only water, while my best friend ordered a Bloody Mary, he said last time it was extra spicy but super delicious. After waiting a while, we finally got our drinks and our server finally took our meal order. I ordered the mussel entree and my best friend ordered the ban mi sandwich. 

I have to say my meal was pretty delicious, I'm not sure if that was the right meal seeing how we partied really hard the night before but it was great none the less. My Friend's meal was not the best though. He said his sandwich didn't really have flavor and well, was nothing special.

For the price point it was A-OK. Would I come again? Maybe...if the service continued to be slow that next time might be the last time.
