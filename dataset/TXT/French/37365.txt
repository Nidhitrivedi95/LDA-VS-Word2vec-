j0baDQfMAGDm_QGdFMmb-Q What a lovely little gem tucked into a retail center on Via Linda in Scottsdale.  Dinner was fabulous - beautifully prepared French cuisine and a comfortable, yet elegant setting.  I ordered the branzino with mussels, clams and a saffron sauce that I wanted to lick off the plate (but didn't!) and my husband had the almond trout...which I also wanted to eat after a taste.  We shared a generous asparagus salad, a wonderful bottle of French white wine and a Madagascar vanilla creme brûlée. The server and one of the owners stopped by several times to chat and make sure we had everything we needed and made our experience relaxed and memorable. We will definitely be back and look forward to enjoying the patio once the weather warms again.
