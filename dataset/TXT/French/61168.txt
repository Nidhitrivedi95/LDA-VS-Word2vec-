SFnrHuVFSNiondFVUBLJZQ My trip to Montreal fell on Canada day unexpectedly and we could not find many places that were open. We were checking out old Montreal and we were starving. Chez Suzette looked like the best option for crepes so we stopped by for brunch. They have 3 stories of seating. The hostess was not helpful at all when I told her we would like a table with a view. She sat us in the middle and we had to ask someone else to move to the table by the window. The view from our table was pretty nice. 

It took forever for our waiter to show up which was too bad because I was thirsty and just wanted water. The price of a simple crepe was off-putting so we got one to share. What stood out to us was the smores crepe. We asked the waiter if we could get it with bananas rather than marshmallows as we were allergic. He said no problem. Not once did he say that there would be a charge to substitute. 

Our smores crepe was tasty but very small for the high price they charged. When we got our bill we were outraged to see it cost over $20. Are you kidding me?! For a stingy crepe! What made me very mad was they charged us $2 for a few slices of bananas. We asked the waiter and he said there is nothing he can do about it. 

The crepe was good but no way worth the price. We wanted to try the fondue but it did not look like it would be worth the cost. Next time we will save our calories and go to the much superior cacao 70.
