rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Came here for a team dinner. Server was very attentive and friendly.

We were served fresh bread to start and toasted pistachios - on the house. I never loved pistachios so much in my life - they tasted amazing warmed up! It was so addictive I couldn't help but go back for more. From now on, I'm toasting all my pistachios!

For the main, I got the steak frites but substituted the frites for fried gnocchi. Steak was super tender and delicious but I wasn't a fan of the fried gnocchi.. It tasted like soft fried dough. 

I got the pear tart for dessert which I didn't enjoy that much either - the tart wasn't very flaky and the dessert tasted a bit dry. The sorbet tasted amazing though!

Overall it's a great place but I would definitely come here for a special occasion.
