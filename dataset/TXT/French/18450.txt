A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g Great place to go for a treat! We went here for dessert after dinner elsewhere. We had the flan, a chocolate cookie and salted caramel macaroon. They were all excellent. Cookie was moist, chewy and flavorful. Salted caramel macaroon was rich and had  great texture. The flan was not too sweet or rich which was perfect for my husband's preferences and the serving size was so big that I got to enjoy it too. I plan on going back to try their lunch menu, as well as some more sweet bakery treats!
