hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA Great and friendly service, fresh and tasty food. Their coffee is great too. Unexpectedly nice compared to its size. Run by a French family, they obviously put love in their food. Down side is the hidden location out of sight but good things are hard to find anyways. The other down side is it is closed on weekends. Yes Olivier is very personable and makes a big effort to remember the patrons' names and repeat orders. The Moraccan sandwich is our favorite with my wife.
