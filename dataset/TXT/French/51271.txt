P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ We got the Prestige Prix Fix menu for the whole table.  It was just ok.  The food was pretty typical of these types of places.  They spend more time telling you about the food and how it's prepared than it takes you to eat the small bite of it.  The waitstaff make you feel like it's a big deal in how you actually eat the food--as in, you have to wait for their permission basically.

Speaking of waitstaff, I've been to plenty of restaurants like this--Charlie Trotters, French Laundry--and the service at Guy Savoy was completely lacking.  Actually unprofessional if you factor in that you're spending over $500 per person.  They were not synchronized at all.  Some of them could barely master the English language.  They roll around the impressive bread cart, but then they don't offer you any bread.  WTF?

So, while Guy Savoy may like to make out that it's one of the premier restaurants in the world, I beg to differ.  Plenty of other places in Vegas where the food and the service is MUCH better.
