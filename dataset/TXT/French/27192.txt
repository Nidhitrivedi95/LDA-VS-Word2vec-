dd3GZs6zW2t7BM0cbxAzvg Want an amazing gluten-free meal after 10 in Toronto? Want a trip to France for about $130, for two? Do you want impeccable service and beverage recommendations with samples? Do you want your food to elevate your taste buds and take you on a ride to flavor-town? Eat here. Please! I can't say enough good things about this place. My bf and I were desperate for a bite to eat after traveling all day to Toronto for the first time. Unfortunately, I have Celiac's and I can't just eat anywhere we walk by. This was a little piece of heaven in a sea of fried bar foods. You will not forget your experience here! ENJOY!
