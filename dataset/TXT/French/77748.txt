YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g Had dinner here while we were in Vegas and everything was awesome. I had the Buretta salad and the small plate gnocchi. Both were absolutely delicious. My husband had a Caesar salad and the Osso Buco which I tasted- perfectly done. On the recommendation of our waiter we tried the Brioche Beignets for dessert. Six little puffy dough balls of heaven for your taste buds. They were so good I came back the next evening just to have them again! The restaurant is a bit pricey but hey it's Vegas. Definitely worth the cost in my book!
