YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g Very unimpressed.  I stopped in for a business lunch and ordered the chopped salad.  It was pretty much all lettuce with a couple of small pieces of salami and cheese thrown in.  The salad wasn't satisfying and I left hungry despite paying over $20 for a salad.

I remember this place when it was a high end restaurant with a great menu.  Now it's a mediocre, overpriced casual dining spot with an uninspired menu.  I guess their profit margins are higher, but the repeat customer rate must be terrible.  They definitely lost this customer.
