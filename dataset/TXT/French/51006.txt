p0UAFRye2EibJU_3auW0rg I've been here a few times but for some reason, I haven't reviewed yet. 
Tonight we had crepes and onion soup. The soup was good, but the crepe was, well, not.. And for a restaurant that says they're all about the crepes, I was disappointed. Truth be told, it wasn't my choice to go there, but still. I expect more than a brown square crepe on my plate for $13. 

Server wasn't very friendly either, even after making a mistake on one person's order that caused her to start eating 10 minutes after the others at the table. Not nice, and no offer to make things better. 

Won't be back, if I can help it.
