Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA Basic four star mostly due to the location.  The view is fantastic and the food is fairly good but nothing you will remember.  We had the Chef's table...note it is not a true chef's table kitchen side, simply the name of the table that is surrounded by glass to keep things a little private.  Service was good and again the setting is what makes this place worth going to.
