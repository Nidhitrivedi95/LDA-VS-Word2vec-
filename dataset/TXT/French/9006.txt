4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw This place is AWESOME! You definitely have to sit outside. The outside seating is right along the strip, across from the Bellagio- as you will have a perfect view of the water show while you have lunch or dinner.

The french onion soup was extremely good. The Steak Bordelaise was AMAZING. Portions are not shy. I split this tasty steak with the bf.

I will definitely eat here again :)
