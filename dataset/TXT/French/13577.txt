4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Vegas isn't Vegas if I don't have my Mon Ami Gabi! It's such a great spot for whatever mood you're in and you can't beat the view in the pavillion or on the patio looking out towards the Bellagio Fountain!

I've only done brunch here and always, without a doubt order their eggs benedict with tomato and spinach.....love it! If I feel bad, I will order waffles and their muffin! Believe me, I am not pigging out alone on those carbs!

Mon Ami Gabi's service is always on cue and I haven't experienced bad service.  The service is attentative, water is always filled, and we get seated in little to no time! 

I recently tried the bellini and it was quite refreshing, I will be ordering that again. I always tell myself to explore their menu, but my heart goes to the benies! So maybe one day when I feel like eating out of the box, I will try something different.
