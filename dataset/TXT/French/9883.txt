4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Went at Brunch, had a 30 min wait for patio seating, which we spent gambling in Paris =) The service was fast once seated, servers were very nice, and we ate while watching the Bellagio fountain show. The food was delicious: we ordered the filet mignon and seafood platter to share. Very delicious. I wouldn't say the seafood platter would be enough for three people, so would recommend adding a steak. YUM!
