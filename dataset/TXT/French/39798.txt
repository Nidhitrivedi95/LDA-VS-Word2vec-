K2C8dSx9215LLcIzHL959Q Went here for restaurant week, so I can't comment on the full experience. For $35, got an appetizer and entree. I chose the foie gras and Rohan duck, while my dining partner tried the potato leek soup and the truffle agnolotti. We also split a bottle of blah wine for $60 and the frozen chocolate for $12 for dessert. As a plus, complementary baguette from la gourmandine!

I loved my duck dish, it was a great texture and flavor and was cooked to a perfect medium rare. It was a sizable entree and I was definitely full from it. I wasn't fond of the foie gras, it was served with a marmalade which overpowered the normal flavor and made it really sweet. I also tried the truffle agnolotti and maybe I'm just not a truffle person but I thought it was a very overpowering flavor. The soup was delicious and might have been my favorite part of the meal.

The frozen chocolate was quite a show. A rich chocolate brownie with strawberry purée and blood orange sherbet came on one plate. The chocolate mousse came out on a separate plate and the Chef poured liquid nitrogen to freeze the top layer. It was an interesting mix of flavors, not bad but not mind blowing. I actually thought the frozen component took away from the mousse, other then it being a good show. The frozen parts were a little too hard to eat and tasted kind of icy while the nonfrozen parts were good.

The space is really small, and surprisingly not very decorated. Plain walls, no artwork, one large modern chandelier piece. Overall the food was good, but quite pricy. I wish the dishes were more consistently mind blowing and I wasn't in love with the wine or the space. I suppose a place like this is really set apart by its chef tasting menu, which I'd love to try one day.
