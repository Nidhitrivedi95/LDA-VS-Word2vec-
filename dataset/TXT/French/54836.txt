rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw From the service to the food, this place is outstanding! The restaurant is absolutely beautiful and has such a cool vibe! I came here with my boyfriend for the first time and I loved it! Our server Christina was extremely helpful and attentive! The manager Stephen stopped by to check on us and was very nice. The sommelier Andrew, and Chef Jd were so welcoming and sweet. I would recommend this place to anyone and everyone! I'll be back! #foisgras #duckwings #seabass
