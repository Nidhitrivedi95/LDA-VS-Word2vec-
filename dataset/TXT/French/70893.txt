xBxDMEkFK5GBhiy-8gGE9w Absolutely horrible.  I took one bite of steak and then proceeded to spend the next 15 minutes chewing it.  Flank steak can be succulent and tender if cooked properly.  After sending it back sans one bite and telling my waiter that I didn't care for it, I was still charged for it.  Class act, Brasserie t!
