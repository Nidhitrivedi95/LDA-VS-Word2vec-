There are meals that are easy to appreciate and appeal to simpler palates (like the delicious hangar steak),  and more adventurous but no less tasty (like the bone marrow). I like to eat at the bar,  and I have always found the staff professional,  knowledgeable,  and very polite and fast. I always trust my waiter's advice on meals and wine,  and they never lead me wrong. 

I've seen some reviews saying people read other reviews and expected more and consequently were disappointed.  I'd like to ask: what,  exactly,  where you expecting? If you expected an orgasm in your mouth and a super cheap bill,  you may be disappointed indeed.  But for consistently great classic French food,  served by knowledgeable staff in a cozy bistro,  this is your place. It's not as cheap as eating at a restaurant in my hometown,  but then again,  I've never eaten food this great in my hometown,  and I'm happy to splurge to eat and drink well. 

My tips: get reservations,  try a couple different appetizers (I love the pate!) and go for a dessert.  Enjoy!
