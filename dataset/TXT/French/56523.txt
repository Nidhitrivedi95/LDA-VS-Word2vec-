rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Hebe S., whoever you are, I love you.  You were awesome.  You made our experience even better than the food did.  

Chef TK, I don't know how often you visit your Las Vegas Bouchon restaurant, but you truly have a winning staff.

I did like your food, especially the croque madame and frites. The croissant roll was good, the chicken and waffles were good--the baked, not fried chicken was juicy and well brined, while the waffles tasted fresh and unique because of the chives and bacon--but my favorite experience of the day were your beignets. 

And Hebe.

Well done.
