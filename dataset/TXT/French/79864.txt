zra20XPGVL9P3i5hMoKjig Man, what a disappointment!  4.5 star Yelp rating, you let me down.  Came on a Tuesday night and there wasn't another patron up to the time we left around 730p.  Perhaps this area is geared more towards daytime tourists?  All the nearby shops were closed by 7p. Needless to say, we found street parking easily since there weren't many people around.  Whoever classified this as "tapas" on Yelp is misleading.  Tapas are meant to be shared, and although the dishes here are small, they are too pricey to facilitate such activity.

Yellowtail sashimi $18 - 6 pieces of seared fish.  They were ok, very salty.
Pan seared halibut with tomato ratatouille $22 - Ok
Scottsdale Blonde $6
Tiramisu $10 - This was my favorite of the night!  Still not worth $10, though.
