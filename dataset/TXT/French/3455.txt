1idRJwqXxxmgSyQRKag4KQ Came here for my birthday dinner and it was absolutely wonderful from beginning to end. Definitely tops my list for most romantic dining experience in Toronto.

Make sure to get reservations well in advance. My boyfriend booked three weeks before, albeit for a Saturday evening, but the only option was 8:45 (which worked really well for us).

What we had:
Croquettes
Escargots
Lamb quartet
Braised beef
Souffle

They had the option to order a small or large portion of each dish, which was great for sampling. We ordered the small version of everything so that we could have a larger selection.

Croquettes were delicious. We couldn't agree on which stood out more, the truffle or the gnocchi. The escargots dish was incredible, the grapes were a perfect addition to the salty, buttery goodness of the rest of the dish. Lamb quartet was my boyfriend's favourite of the night. The braised beef was, expectedly, awesome.

They asked if it was special occasion, and we told them it was my birthday. I normally wouldn't do that for fear of being embarrassed, but it was a clear a place like this wouldn't suck all the class out of the evening with some obnoxious "HAPPY BIRTHDAY" announcement. They brought over a beautiful plate which they'd written "Happy Birthday" on in chocolate, and included two tiny white chocolate cups with cherries. Probably the most tasteful recognition of a birthday I've ever seen at a restaurant.

Even though we were getting very full, we had to try their signature souffle and we were glad we did. 

The entire dinner took about three hours which, I think, is the best possible way to spend a Saturday evening. The wine, the service and especially the food made this place one of the best dining experiences I've had in Toronto. Amazing.
