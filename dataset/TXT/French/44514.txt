MhFoFpLBx_Fy8gs9dlwtGA This is a very good little bistro. I like the feel of the place...a little bustly, a little crowded, can sometimes get a bit loud, menu on a big chalk board, it's all part of the atmosphere. I've been here quite a few times and will go back. Everything I've had has been delicious and very well priced! Might not be the best French place in Montreal but, for the money, it is VERY good.
