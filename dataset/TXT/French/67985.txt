v50-nvBCZNf7nCNbyUlQLw Love it, love it, love it. From sweet to savory, Crepes Parisiennes has what you want. I've hit them up for both breakfast and lunch and have left feeling like I've eaten an appropriate food for the time of day.

I love their breakfast crepe. They lightly fry the exterior giving it a nice, crispy outside and stuff it full of sausage, sharp cheese and egg. I've heard people complain about the authenticity of the side salad but, come on, who cares? The crepes are authentic enough, the salad is an afterthought and is still delicious, authentic or not.

Their sweet crepes are all balanced nicely. I've had their Gnutella crepe and their "french toast style" berry crepe. Both were delicious and came with a generous dollop of their homemade whipped cream.

As if their crepes weren't enough, they also do a killer cafe au lait. It's served in an authentic French fashion, in a handleless bowl and comes with a generous circle of white, velvety foam. The beverage is a little on the hot side, which is usually a no-no when it comes to good coffee, but I let it slide because they still pack it full of flavor.

This place gets packed on the weekends yet the service has always been impeccable. They even bring my dessert crepe out after my meal!
