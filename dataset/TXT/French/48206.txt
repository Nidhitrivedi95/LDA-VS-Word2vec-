Stopped in for a cocktail and a beer on a warm Wednesday evening. We were seated right away by a lovely hostess on the Bellair side patio where we were left parched and unattended for 25 minutes. Interestingly, bus boys and other servers walked down Bellair and they made eye contact(ish) and offered us half smiles.
 But we didn't come for that.
 We came for a drink. Did I mention it was hot out?!?
 After another forgotten table aggressively flagged down a bus boy to place their order, we decided to stop being nice Canadians and impose ourselves upon our server and place a drink order...which arrived 10 mins later: 1 cool beer (not cold) and 1 terribly artificial and cloying watermelon mojito accompanied by a meek inquiry from Manager Mario as to whether we have been 'well taken care of this evening?'
Hey Sassafraz, maybe you can fool the tourists, but you are no longer chic enough to pull off bad service.
