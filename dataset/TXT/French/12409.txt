4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I had an amazing Christmas Dinner here. I had made reservations and arrived early just in case reservations were running late due to the holiday. The host was very friendly and helped me check in at 7pm to ensure my seat would by ready at 7:30pm as I walked around the Paris Hotel.

We ordered Mussels and Frites with a white wine sauce - it was to die for. I could drink the sauce just like that.

We also ordered the classic steak and frites and the hanger steak and frites. Both were succulent, juicy, and tender. I always find restaurants mess up steaks a lot but not Mon Ami Gabi. 

One of my favourite restaurants of Las Vegas and a must try for those visiting the area. The lunch menu looks amazing as well. I do recommend making reservations as this place gets busy.
