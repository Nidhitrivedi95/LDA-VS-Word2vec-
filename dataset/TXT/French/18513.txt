aaWhSHpsE285eaSTzDxAMA Finally made a commitment to have dinner here and I could kick myself for waiting so long. My wife and I decided to head there for dinner. Made reservations on through their Yelp listing, which tired me into my  Open Table app!! Nice link!

Arrived few minutes ahead of our time and the hostess,  Kia quickly took us to our table, but noticed a corner, more intimate table was opening. She asked if we didn't mind , she would get it at and we could sit there! Perfect suggestion!

We were told our server was be Stephanie and what a joy to really be served! Steph was quick, attentive, and had every detail covered. Took our drink order and asked if e were going to order an appetizer which we did; the calamari! Having a wife who is an excellent cook and a trained chef son, this was the best calamari I've eatened. Thick, moist pieces not overly deep-fried, were served along two dipping sauces. If I had four thumbs, I would give it for thumbs up!

My wife had the bacon wrapped scampies on a bed of rosito, while I ordered the Veal Marsala. Both dishes were served quick and pleasantly hot, which just enhanced the flavors of both plates. My wife said the scampies were cooked to perfection and the bacon wrapping was juicy and had just the right crispyness to enjoy with each tasty bite. She highly recommends this plate.

It has been a while since I have had veal marsala, but tonight I was thrilled to attack this plate!! The veal was tender and easily cut by firm, with out the need of a knife. Two good size pieces, served with three nice sized raviolis and shitake mushrooms. An Outstanding Plate!!

Never would have guessed we would have such an outstanding meal right here in Cleveland!!! A MUST TRY SPOT FOR THE NEVER HERE BEFORE.

Finally, not often I say sit in a certain servers area, but at Bistro 185, by all means possible, get Stephanie as yours! She added a professional touch to our night out dining!
