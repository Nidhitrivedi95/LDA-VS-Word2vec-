jwYnXuaSqtpiNwyU72Vm9Q The fish, the seafood, the hummus with meat and the salads are absolutely exquisite... very fresh and light. Some of their items are a little bland, mostly the side dishes and the meats. 

It's my go-to restaurant when I want a healthy meal, even if I end up eating way too much with the excuse that it's healthy. 

Usually service is very good and prices are very reasonable considering the high quality of the food.
