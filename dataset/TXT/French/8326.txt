4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I finally got to have dinner here and everything was a great experience!  We celebrated a birthday here with a group of 6 people and we had made reservations and were lucky enough to have it near enough the patio that we were able to view the Bellagio water show during dinner!

The girls started out with a martini that had grey goose and champagne and I think something else too which was really good! 

The escargot was delicious!  It was in a pesto sauce which can out nice and hot!  The brie and garlic starter was also very delicious and it was really good with the fresh baguettes they had as well!  

I had the rib eye and lots of different sides and everything was good! I love to eat my meat medium rare and it's hard to find places that actually make it medium rare! It's always more medium than it is rare but Mon Ami Gabi did a great job! The meat was tender and very flavorful.
