oZHbPhIj01_31jqD053a_Q Definitely an interesting experience.  We had the Discovery tasting menu, and it felt like being the audience in a show where you really weren't sure what was going to happen next.  Props,  smoke,  Cuban cigars. ..it is truly a creative showpiece.  

I wish that more planning was put into the way the various dishes fit together.. I found that many of the appetizers clashed, as did the mini desserts.  Highlight was the fois gras caramelized on a hot stone set in a dinner plate under a glass bell jar... Very tasty and cooked literally right under your nose! 

Also the lobster bisque was perfect, the best I've ever had. So I had huge expectations of their of their signature entrée - veal cheek in a chorus sauce. But I found the meat too tender, almost mushy,  and the flavoring too salty.  

Overall,  I was impressed by the presentation... but some of the dishes still have room for improvement.
