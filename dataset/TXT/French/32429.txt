gxMa7j1LXIUxxBoP0osDpA I would give the food a 3.5* but since it is a bywo i give it sn overall of 4*.

Although I remembered the food being a lot more tasty when I came here for a private wine tasting and the restaurant was serving small bites.

All dishes come with a cold soup; taste was a bit blend. 

Took a scallop entrée and it was alright,  but didn't like the cucumber mousse that came with it. I don't like cucumber do didn't enjoy the mousse...but you might.

Took the salmon as a main course and it was tasty. it was semi cooked which I like ane it had great flavor.
