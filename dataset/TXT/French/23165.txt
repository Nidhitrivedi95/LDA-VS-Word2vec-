C3PK_1n4xHuC3eCo_azYgw My favourite place in the Mile End to fill my belly for $5.

Looking at Yelp, I'd almost call this place a well-kept secret, but come in during nearby Ubisoft's lunch hour rush and the lineup out the door will disabuse you of this notion! Come in at any other time though and you'll have sandwich in hand before you know it, because the service is super quick (don't be afraid of the lineup, it moves quickly!). Don't come too late though because they're closed by 5, sometimes earlier. 

The sandwiches range from $4.50 to $6 (2014 prices), tax included, and they are a good size. Extras (cheese, meat, veggies, hot veggies) are $1-$2. Most of the choices are meat but there are some cheese and vegetable options for the vegetarians out there. You can also choose whole wheat bread, to which I attribute major points! Get your sandwich all dressed to include cheese, lettuce, tomato, and THE BEST DIJONNAISE YOU'VE EVER TASTED. Seriously, that stuff is the sandwich equivalent of magic pixie dust.

They have a pretty big variety of deli meats to choose from, but I keep going back to the salami because I love that stuff. Aside from sandwiches, they offer a great selection of canned and bottled beverages and some delicious pastries (my favourite is the cannoli) to round out your lunch. Don't plan to sit down inside though, because there's no dining area (another heads-up: cash only). If you're not near home/work/somewhere you can eat a sandwich, and the weather is nice, I recommend eating it on the steps of the big old church at St-Viateur & St-Urbain.

Finally, supporting this place makes me feel good because it's one of the few enduring independent places on St-Viateur that hasn't changed since I started working in the neighbourhood in 2008. I really don't want it to close and turn into another one of those "artisanal" places that seem to be flooding the neighbourhood and charging rich-people prices.
