B5B0G6Yy_LDymFH7_ZNvyA I ate here with a small group of friends and generally found this small restaurant to be reasonable. The staff are perfectly polite and reasonably quick to satisfy your requests.


 As someone who's both lived and worked in France, it's worth mentioning that the staff do indeed speak French - so if you're interested in making use of the French language, it's not a problem.


 With regards to price, I found Petite Paris to be slightly on the more expensive side of affairs. However, I managed to have a nice meal with a glass of wine (no starters,) for around twenty pounds. So if you're a student it's certainly not out of your depth financially, but at the same time I suspect this is somewhere you don't want to eat on a regular basis.


 My only real criticism is that the name Petite Paris should perhaps be taken literally. As at times, you may very well find yourself quite pushed for space and it can be hard to maneuver around staff, tables and other customers when busy.


 All in all, a nice if slightly cramped restaurant, which has something to offer for at least a one time dining experience.
