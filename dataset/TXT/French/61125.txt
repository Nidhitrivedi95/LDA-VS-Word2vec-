SFnrHuVFSNiondFVUBLJZQ Fell in for breakfast here after an early morning flght, workng on bascally no sleep. Good coffee, welcoming servers and very good crepes. Happy happy joy joy. And just in case I was too tired to remember I was in Montreal, my ham and brie crepe came with a little plastic cup of maple syrup on the side. Maple syrup...Montreal's all-natural GPS locator. Nice little boite for breakfast or lunch.
