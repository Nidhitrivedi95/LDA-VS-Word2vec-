SD7vTf-H00J8BS3L-kt7jg Since I'm from New York, I was told by my girlfriends brother that Yelp in Montreal is not accurate or representative having not really caught on yet as it has in New York  - which I can confirm, because there's no way this place can possibly be 3 stars. 

Popped in here after perusing their butcher shop that's located just a block away and decided we needed to try something. Had the burger and couple glasses of wine...it was one of the best burgers I've ever had in my life: Canada AA rated American beef, cooked to perfection with amazing texture and construction. Staff very friendly and hospitable (minus the host, he was actually quite rude when we walked in at 5:30...the place was empty but he considered not seating us due to the incoming evening reservations - eventually he let us sit at the bar but said, "you need to be gone by 7:30"). Very cool space as well.

Highly recommend this place for locals and anyone passing through.
