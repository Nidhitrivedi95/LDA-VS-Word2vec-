teTQU7TIPE0O_B1zN_239w The meal chosen was tasty but I will not be returning.  As a first time patron, I was given free muffins, with extra protein...a bug crawled out of one of the muffins. Not sure if trying to sue them is worth the time or money so I just won't return and I'll share the video with others so they are informed. It doesn't allow me to attach the video. The muffin may have been carrot, not sure.
