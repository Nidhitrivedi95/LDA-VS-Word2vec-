cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg I came here a second time and still couldn't get a reservation.  I ended up eating my EXTREMELY DELICIOUS FOIE GRAS POUTINE on the curb.  

Top three best meal of my life! 

The Duck gravy is perfect! Savory, flavorful and a good consistency.  Big lobs of foie gras nestled on top.  It was so beautiful, I teared up momentarily before devouring. Don't even think about the $37 price tag. Just order it and enjoy a full body foodgasm.
