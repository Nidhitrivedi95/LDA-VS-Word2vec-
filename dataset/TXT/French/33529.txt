hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA I love the fresh and flavorful sandwiches at Baguette Cafe!  My favorite is the eggplant panini with mozzarella and tomato pesto...such a delicious combination of flavors and textures with the melted cheese!  I recommend sitting in the restaurant if you can find a seat.  The sandwiches are served with a small salad and a delicious balsamic vinaigrette if you eat in.  The chicken sandwich with cheddar cheese, bacon and tomato pesto is also very good, as is the chipotle chicken sandwich.  The only one I haven't liked so far is the Bleu Brie.  I will be back to try some of their homemade soups.  

Definitely order a coffee and relax a while.  The service is great, Oliver is always very welcoming.  It gets crazy around lunch time, though.  The hours are M-F 7a-5p, and they are closed on weekends.  I always want to go for lunch on Sunday, and have to remind myself that it is closed!
