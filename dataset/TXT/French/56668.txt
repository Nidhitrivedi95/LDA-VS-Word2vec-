We came for brunch  - very filling and a bit heavy.  We had their New England Clam Chowder to start.  Lots of spices, pretty thick.  My husband really enjoyed it.  They brought some breads, and I personally really liked their peach jam.  Yummy.

Our main dishes were signature the Croquet Madame and one of their specials (my french is awful, but it was scrambled eggs on a housemade puff pastry with spicy sausage).  Both dishes were delicious but H-E-A-V-Y.  Don't think I'll be craving either dish again any time soon...

Waiter was very friendly, but service was a little slow.  Great ambiance.  A must try in Vegas, at least once...
