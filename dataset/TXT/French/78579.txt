However the quality of the food was average or below and the staff (other than the host) seemed uninterested, uninformed and ill at ease.  I am resourceful and soon figured out that other than having the food delivered to the table, I had to get everything....I even had to search for a glass for my beverage.  I wanted to sit down and enjoy a nice lunch. Instead, I left without having had a pleasant experience and probably won't return.
