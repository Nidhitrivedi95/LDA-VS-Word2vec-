4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I've eaten here twice in the past year: both times for breakfast, but with very different people.

On the first trip, I was with glam gals Bianca B and Trish S. They are way fancier than I am, and they both liked Mon Ami Gabi. The second trip was with my boo and my parents. My dad is more of a good ole boy, and he can be a bit hard to please. But he loved his steak and eggs so much that he wanted to go again the very next morning!

Moral of the story: Mon Ami Gabi is a crowd pleaser, no matter the crowd you're trying to feed. 

I have to give a special nod to MAG for their awareness of gluten-free options. I was dismayed at the lack of gluten understanding in LV, but this place gets it right. I've had the gluten-free eggs benedict both stops here, and it was absolutely delicious!

If you're on the Strip and find yourself hungry for breakfast, Mon Ami Gabi is a great pick for any palate!
