The place is extremely overpriced and the food is not very good. We were here end of June and paid $60 per person for not very memorable food. 
The waitress tried very hard to keep up with our group of 15, but none of the other employees seemed to want to help her out until they were giving us our bills. Go somewhere else if you're with a group because they force you to order from a prix fixe menu that will not taste very good or fill you up, clearly ripping you off.
