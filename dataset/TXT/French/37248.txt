iwFoA98-OgcdXmNS0LxNOA I really like the 3 brewers. They have many options for beer that can be paired with your dish. I tried the fish and chips with a blonde beer. Absolutely enjoyed every bite. The beer complimented it as well. I also tried the waffle dessert, which came with ice cream and beer infused caramel sauce. Melt in your mouth awesomeness. Enjoyed the food, the service was subpar. Especially late at night.
