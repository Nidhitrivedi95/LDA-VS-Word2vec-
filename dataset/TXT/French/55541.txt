rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A On our last Vegas trip, my boyfriend and I made sure to make our way to Bouchon for breakfast. It was a Wednesday, so luckily when we arrived at around 10 am, we were seated right away. We asked for patio seating and to our surprise we were seated in the best table because it was right in front of this beautiful fountain in the Venetian courtyard. The service from the get go was impeccable. Without even asking for more water, your glass is always full because they fill it up regularly and that's such a nice touch on their part. 

As far as the food is concerned, it is one of the best breakfasts I've ever had. We ordered the French toast (with side of bacon), eggs Benedict and the seasonal fruit salad to share. Everything was incredible. Can't wait to go back on our next trip to Vegas!
