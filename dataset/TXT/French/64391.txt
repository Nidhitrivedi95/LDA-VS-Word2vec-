tCSlpwJQ4CZsUEMZeH2SFg This used to be my favorite brunch spot (mainly for their Eggs Benedict), but after the last three times I've ordered EB here I'm strongly considering looking somewhere else now. The main issue I've been constantly having is that they over-poach their eggs; the yolk is not runny whatsoever- it'll be of a gelatinous state. Even when I've requested that they be undercooked they'll still come out overdone. Also, their hollandaise sauce has started lacking the vibrant flavor it used to have; now it's close to being bland. The newest issue I experienced today is that they no longer serve a nice, thick slice of Canadian bacon on it... instead they have replaced it with two paper-thin slices of deli-style ham (per side). For around $14 I expect the better quality that they used to serve, not the poor excuse of an Eggs Bene they are now trying to pass off.
