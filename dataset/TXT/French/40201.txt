KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA If you want class, come here.  Only a few miles away from the Strip you would never know it.   Dinner on a lake with a fireplace and the soft tones of live first rate musicians?  Where am I?  This is Las Vegas at it's finest.  Superb food.   Friendly locals.    And the best creme brulee on the planet.   Try the new wine by Opus One...Overture...it's available in their wine stir, asking with hundreds of others, and they will let you drink it with dinner...No 300% markup here.   Great value great place.
