rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw Another extraordinary night at Bardot, perfect execution with diverse flavors, stimulating through night end!

The Foie Gras here served two ways, both as delectable and decadent as they come. The Beluga Lentils an interesting yet fitting combination, the parfait variety a MUST have every visit!

The surprising winner here being an out of this world Creekstone Prime Rib, putting to shame anything that you've yet encountered with the prime rib label. Both flavor, texture and welcomed array of accompanying sauces putting to rest any preconceived perception of the classic dish. Order!

The Smoked Salmon Paris Brest taking same route, with an explosion of flavor and balance of taste, jading every lox and bagel forward. The caviar elevating even further and Chive Mascarpone adding a subtle sweetness and fresh bite.

And last but not least, the new Beef Wellington for Two, a generous portion, arguably enough for Four, with a fair spread of other enjoyables. Delicate beef wrapped in Prosciutto, cooked in a flaky puff pastry and stuffed with Mushroom Duxelles and soaked in Foie Gras-Madeira Veloute. Mouthwatering!

If you have not been to Bardot yet, you're missing out ;)
