3jKUbhGSjFTv5jZ0wnW0xA Went there for dinner. The food was fantastic. Two of us shared French onion soup, risotto appetizer, and lamb shank. We had creme brulee for dessert, which was a bit of a disappointment (not as creamy as others brulees that I've had/made). We tried to use the yelp coupon for free dessert, and even though we showed/told the waitress ahead of ordering the dessert, she insisted on charging us for it. Besides the dessert fiasco, the service was good.
