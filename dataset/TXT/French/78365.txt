YVYHX7RCPjCBqEth2CS91Q Never wait until the week before your Groupon is to expire. We arrived on a Thursday evening at 8:30. Didn't get seated until 9, and at 9:45 didn't even get a piece of bread. So don't know if it common  practice or just due to the Groupon rush, but this will be my last trip to Brasserie 33 regardless of the food quality. 

OK, the food was pretty good, but we were starved by 10 pm. The fries were a surprise, and excellent, but they claimed to be out of ketchup. Wine is overpriced. Then they totally screwed up the bill.  Get me outta here! No more Groupons EVER!!! No more Brasserie 33 EVER!!! It is now 10:30 pm!!!
