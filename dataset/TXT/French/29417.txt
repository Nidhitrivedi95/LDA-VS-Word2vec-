ey9c-TjWXgTJ5OlD0HPd_A This bright small restaurant run by two ladies is quite charming. Wanting something a bit different than the usual eggs brunch etc Engaufrez-vous looked like a perfect choice in the Plateau. The relaxed service since both of them were taking orders and delivering food it can be slightly slow but we weren't in a hurry.

While there was an initial mishap of lost rsvp even though we received an email confirming it. C'est la vie. They did not. Needless, to say we join the line of waiting customer for a table. Eventually, seated in two comfortable red sofa chaise towards the front of the restaurant. Both ordered the Carousels with waffle and one with Gaufres Bruxelloises and the other liegeoises. The waffle was light and mildly sweet from the dusting of powdered sugar. The liegeoise was smaller denser slightly sweeter. Both ordered the fruit and I had the omelet with tomatoes. 

The brunch meal was perfect. It was light, the fruit refreshing with the right amount of food. Everyone was content with their choices. It is going to be a good day.
