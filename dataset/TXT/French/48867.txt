oJZNHz5UUVUgrZwVBVlpYw The pianist at this piano bar was excellent, as was people watching. The bar is directly across from the front desk and between the casino area and the garden, so there are tons of people streaming by. It was fun just watching the crowds of people. 

We each had a martini. The drinks are ridiculously expensive IMHO, but I guess you are paying for the location, the sumptuous/lavish decor, the pianist and professional server. I would have rated this bar higher, but our martinis didn't even give us a buzz. I would give this place 2 stars, based on that, if it wasn't for the ambiance/location and the fact that parking is free.
