xcmmTXhuMx2fZF2Bt69F4w Just had Sunday brunch here and I had high expectations for the Liege waffles since after all this is a Belgian restaurant.  The waffles came topped with "spiced apple" fruit topping.  First cut into the waffles, they were super dry.  The taste was good, but they were too burnt and dry for me to enjoy them.  The fruit topping was pretty good, but the waffles also came with big slices of cantaloupe, pineapple and honeydew melon, which were just terrible.  Regardless of the fruit, the star should be the waffles, but they certainly fell short of my expectations.  If you want good waffles, go to Waffalonia in Squirrel Hill.  My boyfriend ordered the croque madam, which he was excited about, but once again everything was dry.  The slices of brioche were huge and burnt (DRY!!!!!).  It was supposed to come with ham and gruyere inside, but there was not much ham or gruyere to be found.  The slice of ham in the sandwich was also dry.  I tried some of his sandwich and I could not cut through the ham.  At least the bechamel sauce was decent, but the rest of the sandwich was disappointing.  We still love this place, but maybe the key is to not go here for Sunday brunch.  We've been to lunch and dinner here many times and were not disappointed.  We just won't return for brunch.
