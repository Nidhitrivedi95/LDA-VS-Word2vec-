Restaurant A L'aventure has a small breakfast menu with croissants (I think our waiter said they were made on the premises), omelettes (delicious), and crepes (yummy!).  Our waiter was excellent and the food was very good, though a little on the pricey side.  For the location though, the price seemed fairly reasonable.  I ordered the crepes, which came with a fruit kebab.  The strawberry on the kebab stick was a bit bruised, but overall, I was happy with my meal.
