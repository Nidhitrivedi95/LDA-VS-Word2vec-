rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A The restaurant is beautiful, located in the Venetian...kind of a maze to get to.
Freezing in the restaurant....not sure what's up with restaurant being freezing cold in Vegas, probably trying to rush people out, but there was literally no one there.
They serve the bread on the paper cover that's lying over the table and they give you no bread plate so it was interesting....especially since the whole restaurant looked so formal....by the time we were done with the crusty bread, we had breadcrumbs all over our table!  
For my main entrée I ordered the Croque Madame, came out lukewarm....my friend also ordered this and hers came out cold.  The cheese that they put over it is creamy and weird....the whole thing was weird...do NOT get the croquet madame.
Another friend we were with ordered the Warm Asparagus salad and for $14 you literally get like 5 pieces of asparagus with sauce drizzled on it....more like a side rather than a salad.
We also had to repeatedly ask for condiments and they really took a long time fetching it for us....the manager even came over and told us he'd get us more mustard and then he walked away and never returned.....
Overall experience...I probably wouldn't come back.
