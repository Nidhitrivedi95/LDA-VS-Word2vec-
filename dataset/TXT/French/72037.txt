XKPosZx2j4RHcZ8Ewdwj0A This chic bistro in Outremont is known for its upscale dining but I never had the chance to stop in for brunch, so a friend and I decided to check it out on a Saturday. Walking in, you know this place has class, thanks to the welcoming staff in uniform, the dark chairs and white tablecloth tables, and prominent chandeliers. We opted for a seat on their covered terrace seeing it was a beautiful sunny day. The place was already busy so I would understand why reservations are needed; we were lucky to snag two spots as we were there quite early.

The menu offers refined brunch options from fruit and cheese to boudin, and classic brunch cocktails like mimosas and bellini. We ordered one of each and both opted for the poached eggs, blinis, smoked salmon and caviar. The cocktails were great and the food, which came with toasted bread, rhubarb and mango spreads, was outstanding! The drinks sh was both sweet and savoury, and those blinis were just perfection! The prices are higher than your typical brunch spot but this 19$ dish was well worth it!

Service was prompt and very friendly even though the place was real busy; food and drinks arrived quickly once we ordered, and the staff were quick in picking up empty glasses and even refilling our water. 
 
We lingered for a bit, people watching and sipping on an iced coffee, which was the perfect way to end our visit!
