Yp1swb-8pO8i-6-jaK2tsA Had a bogo voucher so came in for breakfast.
I had breakfast tacos with side of breakfast potatoes which were nice.  Johan had corned beef hash Benedict which when arrived looked a little sad, it's not served with an English muffin.
Coffee was revolting, tasted like dirt.
Server was inattentive and didn't know the menu very well.
I'll only return with another bogo.
