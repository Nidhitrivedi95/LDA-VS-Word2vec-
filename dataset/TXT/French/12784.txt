4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Came here for Christmas dinner finally after numerous trips to vegas and saying "I want to go there!!"  Well I finally went and it was great food.  We ordered the cheese plate for appetizer and it was to die for, especially with the fresh baked baguette that they kept brining to my table after we fell in love with it.   We ordered the 22 oz bone in steak to share with garlic spinach and whipped cauliflower.  OMG!!! it was better than mashed potatoes and was just the best fluffy, creamy goodness that I have ever tasted.  The steak was cooked to perfection and the ambience was the best as well.  

I am a sucker for parisian ambience and this place is the place for it.  I must say I was a little ticked off by the staff that help the waiters at the table... they were not the nicest people and just plopped and slided the plates on the table when they arrived, until I had to say something and they they all got nice....... interesting. Needless to say our waitress was fantastic and answered all our questions about the menu and made sure to check on us without being too overbearing.  

Apparently the hot ticket dinner item was the beef bourginione which I will have to order next time I am in vegas..... love that beef!!!
