5EIuCcoHY2evAhFMBV6G6g Went here for lunch and ordered Moules Marinière with Pinot fries. The Mussels were just OK and the sauce was a little heavy on the cream for this classic dish. The dish was also served warm which didn't impress me too much. To their credit the Pinot fries were delicious with a nice amount of garlic in the seasoning. 

Overall an average place to have lunch in Vegas. If you want a good lunch at a French restaurant head over to Mon Ami Gabi at Paris.
