rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I've traveled to Vegas 6 or 7 times for various work or vacation reasons in the last 8 years. I've had some very good food and some not so great food. This has been the best dining experience I've ever had. We went for brunch.....2 days in a row because it was so delicious!!! Gorgeous bistro like setting, attentive staff, every dish and beverage of the highest quality and reasonably priced!! We ate our delicious brunch here while some others in our group ate sub par food at a breakfast buffet for the same price. They were so disappointed when they heard what we enjoyed and decided to join us the next morning. This place is a gem!!!
