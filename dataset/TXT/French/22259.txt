BSmqxPbQglQwP2R56OqOag Since my last review, I've been to Local Bistro several more times.  Every time I go, the food is great and the service is even better.  We have yet to be disappointed in the overall experience. 

As far as food goes, I've had several of their entrees including the risotto and pasta.  Both were delish.  The pizza is also tasty as was the special my Husband had one evening.  Seriously, you cannot go wrong with this "local" gem!
