xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g The food was good... if you have the appetite of a newborn. It is very bougie and underwhelming, if thats the vibe you're going for. I got the lamb and a side of salt with potato. If you're coming for the view, it might be a better idea to come for drinks or dessert then head to in n out. Also, I ordered Brussel sprouts and was incredibly disappointed. I think thy bought the microwaveable pack from Trade Joe's. They also have a "proposal package" If any girl is into this type of thing
