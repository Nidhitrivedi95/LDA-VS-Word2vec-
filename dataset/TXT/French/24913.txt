COgwFthJpS4We16W5Gf4lw Came here on Valentine's Day and had a fantastic time! 

This place is very romantic. Old school Vegas at its finest. We were seated promptly though we showed up 20 minutes early for our reservation. The menu was a four course prix fixe due to the holiday but you had a choice of appetizer and entree. 

I tried: 

Lobster Bisque - it was very good. A little lighter than most that I have had which I appreciated because I'm not really into super thick soups. 

Salad - it was good but I can't remember the ingredients so forgettable.

Soft Shell Crab - I ordered this not realizing what it was and a wave of regret washed over me when they set it down in front of me. I am not into eating whole bodies of creatures. However, in the spirit of the evening and, since I did order it, I tried it. It was very delicious! Despite, being a little disgusted by what I was eating, the flavor of it was great! Not sure I'll be trying it again soon but hey...at least me and this dish will always have Vday at Pamplemousse! 

Filet - perfectly seasoned, cooked expertly  to medium, and melt in your mouth tender. This steak was fantastic. The presentation was a little odd as it was plated with french fries. They were tasty fries and reminded me of McDonalds's recipe. 

Finally, for dessert, I had the soufflé and tried my husband's raspberry creme brûlée. Both were fantastic.

The timing of the meal, normally my biggest complaint was perfect and our server was on point. This was not our first time visiting and it won't be our last!
