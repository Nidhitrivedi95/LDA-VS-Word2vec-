m9aFZk1f8tSv248YErbpQA Dined here for lunch with my sister and daughter. We each ordered a crepe. My sister ordered a hot water with a lemon after we finished eating, while I ordered a latte. The owner charged us $1 for her hot water. When she told him, and not rude but rather incredulously, why he charged a dollar for a hot water, he actually yelled at her in front of a room full of customers that it's normal to charge a dollar for hot water and to never come back if she doesn't like it. All I can say is, wow, losing customers and reputation over a dollar. Not the best crepes in town and certainly a horrible way to treat nice customers.
