MdjIl105vqCYUGKFSUVytA It took us a while to head to this very popular spot that happens to be close to our neighbourhood, wish we'd come sooner, but life with a toddler limits the date lunches with your spouse, hopefully that will change soon. Back to the point;
Walk in and you are greeted by a very friendly server guiding you to your seat, we choose to sit outside on this beautiful fall day.
The space is clean and classy; what you would expect from such place.
We order white wine by the glass, it is spot on, fresh and beautifully chilled.
For food, we go with oysters, beef tartare, mushroom a la creme and the mussels. 
Oysters are a balance of east and west coast. Now, we eat oysters everywhere, and the oysters here are stellar, one of the best in the city, especially the west coast, perfectly creamy. 
Beef tartare is excellent, perfectly diced. 
The mushroom a la creme is simple and elegant, perfect dish size. 
And the mussels, oh the mussels. We're from a city that is surrounded by sea, and we know our mussels and I've rarely had mussels this well cooked. This is my new fave!
I don't ever comment on the prices in such place because I trust that the establishment knows what they're doing, and this is the case here. 
Our first alone time in 5 months ends with amazing notes on our taste buds. 
Love, love, love.
