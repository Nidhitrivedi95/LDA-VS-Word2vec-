or4UVDjXEEjze3wNPjoAZA My husband and I went to ZB yesterday to have dinner and celebrate our 16th wedding anniversary.  As usual, the service was stellar and the food was perfection. I had the short ribs and my husband had the red snapper special. The waiter surprised us with the chocolate soufflé. Thank you for making our night so special. We will definitely be back!
