SJo_IjvzdRtCvZVN0cbrRQ Blue Door Cafe now.
Fancy food by a high end Chef. Served in a low/middle class area using a decrepid building. The menu read like a French restaurant you would see in Beachwood not Cuyahoga Falls.
I was looking for a normal breakfast at a normal price. Instead I got two pancakes for $9.00. I was seated at a combo booth/table with another couple. If you are a foodie and don't mind sitting at a table with 1990's advertising and you think christmas lights on the wall is good decoration, then this is your place.
