4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw My friend loves this spot & we come each time we visit Vegas. On our last trip we did lunch one day, which was amazing....best gluten free bread!
Breakfast the next morning wasn't super amazing, so I would say lunch or dinner is better.
Last evening we went for dinner about 6:30 with reservations and waited about 15 minutes to be seated, but upon seating promptly greeted and given water.
We got the salmon appetizer to start and a round of drinks. We then got the bourdelaise steak, French onion soup, asparagus, and two sides of the cauliflower purée as it was tasty, plus Caesar salad which we all shared (3 of us)
