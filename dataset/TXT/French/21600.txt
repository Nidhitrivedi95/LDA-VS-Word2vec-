I am giving it 3 star only because it's a cute little French bistro. Neither food or service stood out. 

Poached eggs on the eggs Benedict was cold! Really cold! Coffee had no taste. How can you serve brunch without good coffee and perfect eggs?! 

Service was average. Had to ask a few times to refill water and coffee. 

Surprisingly, this place is full house for Sunday brunch. Is there no other brunch place in the area?!
