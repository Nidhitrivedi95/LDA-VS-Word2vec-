XI3iNUgChOfJk5ppjKVEQQ This place hits the mark on so many levels. Location wise, it's perfect. It's on a charming, slightly less trafficked section on the far west side of Old Montreal. It's open air and a beautifully designed space. The interior atmosphere is rustic, but not stuffy (judging by the wild boar on the wall that's proudly wearing a #foiegras hat). 

Service is excellent. Food is excellent. Everything we tried was great. Taste of Summer was a great starter. The Paella is excellent. Probably the favorite dish overall was the shortribs. Just incredible all around. The Maple Old Fashioned sounded like it could be gross and overly sweet on paper, but worked really well.

Highly recommended!
