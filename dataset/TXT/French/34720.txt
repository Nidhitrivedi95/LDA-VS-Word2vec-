HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw 3.5 stars for the food but I chose to do 4 because I love the chalkboard decorated walls and the kind hostess who made foie happen for us. My girls took me here for my bday dinner and our main mission was to get seared foie. It had been removed from the menu but the hostess asked the chef and he was able to make three dishes for us. The foie was good but its accompaniments were on the mediocre side  and the portion size was tiny!  I enjoyed my friend's fish with haricot vert (the sauce was divine) and fries. Our frisee salad was extremely salty and I didn't enjoy my grainy macaroni gratin. Other decent dishes included the silky mashed potatoes and the nicoise salad. They give out thin, tiny, warm baguettes that I chowed down with their fresh butter.
