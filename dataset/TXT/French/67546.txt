UxWH8zRYIBgs6Q2oykvRdw I came here for a Bridal Shower Brunch. The manager Andrew provided the best service the bride, bridal party and her family could have asked for! He was there to help set up and was willing to do anything we needed him to do in order for the day to run smoothly. The ladies serving the brunch were also extremely helpful and friendly. The food at this place is heavenly! It started as a yogurt and pastry bar and seamlessly transitioned to family brunch including delicious french toast, kale salads, quinoa salads, and bacon. Everything I ate I loved. Mimosas and Champagne were also served throughout. The macaroons were the thank you gifts for all the guests and they came from Cluny's bakery. I cannot express how wonderful of a day this was and it could not have happened without Andrew and his amazing staff! Can't wait to go back to Toronto to experience it all over again!!
