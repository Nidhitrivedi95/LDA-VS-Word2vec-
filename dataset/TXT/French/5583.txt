3jKUbhGSjFTv5jZ0wnW0xA Classic Bistro.  Classic items on a small menu.  Food was decent, good portions and quality was fine.  The waiter and his service is poor.  His greeting was friendly but after taking our order he never looked at is again.  Never came to see if everything was ok, if we would want more wine/ water.  Finished our food and took a good 15min to clear dishes, which the bus girl did.  She brought our food, checked if we were ok, cleared our dishes and took our dessert order, all the while the waiter was around us talking and serving the tables next to us but would ignore us.  Poor bus girl was rushing around trying to cover her job and his job along with those huge party happening upstairs.  He would get 1 or 2 stars.  :-(
