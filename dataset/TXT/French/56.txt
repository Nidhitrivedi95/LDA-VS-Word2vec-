-4TMQnQJW1yd6NqGRDvAeA Let me start with the place.

It's a beautiful house with a nice bar, backyard and outside area right in Old Town Scottsdale. Five stars for that. As a curious fact, the restrooms are outside and are small. 

The food was good but nothing memorable. Everything in the porkbelly dish was tasteful except the porkbelly, that's sad. The noodles and egg were a great mix but the meat lack flavor and it was undercoocked from my point of view.

The Dr. Pepper meat with cheese fries was pretty good.

I had the filet and it was uneventful.

Although I have to say that the goat cheese cake was delicious. I would go back just for that.

Coffee was good too.

The service... well, the service was pretty bad. We learned about the special of the day because the table next to us was told (while we were already eating). To get refills was a journey. My friend asked for fresh napkins and she ended up helping herself. Oh well, good news is that there's plenty of room for improvement.

Cheers
