UpEVdq_euH-5mqCIgUAd2Q I'm so sad I can't write a better review for this place..I've heard of it, it's been on my list of places to try and after finally making a reservation for brunch on Sunday morning with some girlfriends, I was sadly disappointed. 

Aesthetically this place is beautiful. There's a small, cute patio out front and the interior is lovely. 

Now, for the bad: the service was HORRIBLY SLOWI ordered grapefruit juice, coffee and had water and several times throughout the meal all glasses were empty...hydration wasn't a priority. 

I had the eggs Benedict which I thought could have been much better. The hollandaise sauce was mediocre at best and the ham was...I'm assuming smoked, because that's all I could taste. 

I'm not entirely set on writing this place off. I'd like to try their dinner. If I ever do return for brunch, I'm requesting a plate full of frites...because that was the best portion of the experience!
