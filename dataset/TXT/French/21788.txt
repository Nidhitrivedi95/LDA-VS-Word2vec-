Bf-yMQiSmDZyqfGyFKQ0bA I loved this unassuming pub -- looks like a bit of a dive on the outside situated right by the railroad track; walk inside and you'll notice their 30+ craft beer selection. The tables are nothing special and the lighting is dark, so you figure you're at a neighborhood watering hole.

...but after receiving the menu, I was pretty giddy. Most things are under $10 with a mix of small plates, sandwiches and specials. I went with the "Porkzilla." With a name like that, how can you not?! Advertised on the menu as: house smoked and seasoned pork barbeque smothered with Muenster cheese on Italian bread, it did not disappoint. The pork was succulent and juicy, smokey and with a distinct flavor that you can only attribute to the fact that it was house made.

The salsa they serve the tortilla chips with was also OUT OF THIS WORLD! It had a smokey flavor. I don't think I've ever had smokey flavored salsa before, but I couldn't get enough of it. If they sold bottles of it, I would totally have bought some to take home. Blue Dust = solid choice for pub grub. They also have salads and healthy food options, which was an awesome surprise!
