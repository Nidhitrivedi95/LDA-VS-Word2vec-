YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g I'm not sure if I got an errant chef there , but my meal tonight was sub par. The Truffle Onion Soup that everyone raves about was good, but that was about the only thing that was really GOOD for a restaurant of this kind. I expected to be wowed.. but came out dissatisfied. We had the four course pre fixe and my second course was the divers scallops and they turned out to be salty. I told the waitress that they were salty and she said that it was a new dish and she would tell the chef. (nothing against the waitress.. our service was good). 
My main course was the halibut and it was nice and crunchy on the outside, but nowhere close to being moist or soft on the inside. I hate overcooked fish and this was close to overcooked for me. Also, again the corn base.. forget what it was called was salty! 
Dessert - my friend got the chocolate cake and that was good.. gentle flavors and not too sweet. I got the panna cotta desert with a couple of sorbets on top. The panna cotta itself was good, but one of the berry sorbets was overpowering and too tart and didnt mix well with the peach juice base. 
Also, for some reason they advertize a $59 early evening prefixe on their website, but we went in at 6:15 and asked the waitress, she knew nothing about it. Instead we got the Elegance pre fixe for $89.

I live near SF and have eaten at several restaurants that are better. Michael Mina for one.. Cortez before it shutdown..
