mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q This is my third time here. The first time we actually met Robuchon and had an amazing seasonal tasting menu. We came back last year and had a dissappointing menu. But we heard that Robuchon came and took off the menu right away. We were skeptical to come back again, but did it for the last time. There are way too many restaurant in Vegas i want to try.  But, my experience this time was much better. We had the seasonal menu again and everything was superb. My favorite was the scallops, le foie gras soup and le caramel dessert!
