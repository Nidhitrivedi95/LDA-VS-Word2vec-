YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g Underwhelmed - stopped by during a weekday lunch while at an event at Mandalay Bay. Restaurant was oddly deserted. Server raved about the burger like there was no comparison (shouldn't do this unless it carries serious weight..you're in Vegas), so unfortunately tried this on his recommendation. Was tasty, but not worth a return visit. Menu/setting is casual but prices are not. Restaurant oddly juts out into the public area, which makes it feel like you're dining among passerbys.
