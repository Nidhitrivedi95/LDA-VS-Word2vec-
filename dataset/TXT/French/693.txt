_cjPEH9wXhKS-HQe_U3M4Q It was completely unexpected...a colleague suggested lunch; I thought about my pad thai leftovers from Spring Rolls in the fridge and thought, 'Why not?".  And I'm glad I did.  He introduced me to Le Select Bistro and I fell in love...with the restaurant, not him!

It was just lunch, just casual, but I can see the broad appeal - wonderful patio where one can enjoy Sunday brunch, fabulous seating at the bar where one can sip a cocktail solo, ample seating with a real Parisian feel.

And the food?  I had the squash risotto and an espresso...not a great amount of food to judge from, but from what I ate, I was hooked.

I shall return...for lunch again...and for brunch and dinner too.

Vive la France!!!
