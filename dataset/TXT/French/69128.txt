w2tr0PA0b3tg8pId0kjM-A Gaby Ate Jules was the title of a movie I once saw on the internet. I can't give you the link because children may be watching. However, this is not that.

It's a really lovely little clean shiny modern French bakery full of treats, with absolutely lovely service from girls that are genuinely obsessed with their own products and excited about them. The Macarons were good, and probably would have earned 5 stars if they were normally priced, but at $3 a pop, I couldn't possibly give them higher than a 4. I've had much better incarnations of them which are invariably cheaper. Not to mention that Pittsburgh is a cheap-to-mid-price city, and even New York City bakeries (except some of the more posh ones) don't charge this much for a single Macaron.

Still, the products score 5 despite the high prices. Now would you like to see my family Jules.
