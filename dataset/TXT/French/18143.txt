A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g I'm sure I will be getting very chunky because of this place!!! OMG, Sooo good!!!

I ordered some stuff to split for a meeting and I could not believe the size of the items! Huge!!! Everything was really amazing!!! 

I would give 5 stars but, they ran out of some pastries, and also put bread in the French onion soup ( gluten allergy) I called and they said that I had to call eat 24 to refund the $$$ for the missing pastries and soup. I paid with cash, eat 24 said the business had to refund or credit me because it was a cash transaction. I called the business and the girl didn't know how to offer a credit and asked I call eat 24, again. Eat 24 then said its the responsibility of the business to call the customer ahead of time and let the customer know something isn't available, adjust the total and that they would not do anything because it was a cash transaction. Ok, so I'm out about $10.00 not the end of the world, but SUPER ANNOYING.

But, everyone LOVED the pastries! So I guess next time I will just have to get up really early and pick the goodies up myself.
