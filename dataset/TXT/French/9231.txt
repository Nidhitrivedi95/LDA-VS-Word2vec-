4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Second visit to this restaurant. First time was with girlfriends, second time was with fiance.  Filet on first visit was out of this world.  Second visit: the duck confit app was divine.  The trout amandine was good but not great, as was the chicken paillard. Try the inexpensive rose wine.  With the duck, we were dying!
