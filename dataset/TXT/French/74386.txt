You get a view that can't be beat. A clear view of the Bellagio fountains. A dinner and a show!
The service is impeccable. Our waiter Stefan was fantastic. He had a great sense of humor, always kept our water glasses full and extremely quick. We  hit a  few snags which he handled with extreme grace. This is the kind of service I expect at a nice restaurant. 
The food was great. Beautifully plated and oozing with tastiness. From the lobster salad to the duck to the dessert, everything exceeded expectations. 
It is very pricey so make sure you win big and treat yo self.
