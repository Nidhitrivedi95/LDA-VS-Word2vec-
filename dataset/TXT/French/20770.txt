AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw I don't know what to give payard...

my mom LOVES this bakery. every time we come to vegas she has to come here and get one of their little cakes (which are indeed always good). 

i came here and got the fruit tart, which was really awesome. the fruit was fresh and delicious, and the vanilla custard layer was delectable. 

high quality ingredients and pretty good sandwiches too. the prices are a little high, but then so is everything in vegas. i think if you're in vegas and especially if you're staying at the ceasar's palace, then you have to come here at least once. 

bottom line -- payard is good. anything you get is going to be delicious. and sometimes it's just nice to splurge.
