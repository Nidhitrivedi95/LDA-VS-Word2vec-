8ciT6qjI18x9EPtOb-gqYQ First and foremost if you're planning to go...get some good wine or find a friend with a taste for the stuff and have them pick you out something to bring, they do not have any on hand and their food goes very well with it.

We started off with the 3-onion tarte which was absolutely delicious, perfectly baked and you could taste each of the three throughout the tarte.  I chose the chicken and my partner in crime chose the lamb shank.  The chicken was again cooked just right and the sauce complimented both it and the seasoned mashed potatoes wonderfully.  The green beans that came with it had a great flavor but I felt they weren't cooked enough, felt more raw than al dente.  I had some of the lamb shank, it was literally falling of the bone and a fork was all that was needed to pull off pieces to dip in the harisa-flavoured couscous.  Now I'm not one for the game flavor of lamb and this had none of the taste, just a wonderful taste overall.

We settled for the special of the night, a pear tarte with french vanilla ice cream.  The perfect ending to the dinner.  The sugary filling did not detract from the pears and went well with the ice cream.  

Even though I had a groupon for this experience, I can say the experience of such a small and intimate setting will make me want to come back many more times.

This place is definitely somewhere to take a first date you're wanting to sweep them off their feet, or panties.
