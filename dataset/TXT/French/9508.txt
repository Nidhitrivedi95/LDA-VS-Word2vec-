4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Wow! What a treat! This was one of the best dining experiences we've ever had; practically perfect in every way. If they are this meticulous at breakfast, I can't wait to have dinner at this fine restaurant.
We were seated promptly in the glass enclosed dining area that lies between the main dining room and the patio dining area. This was really perfect, as it allowed us to dine in the sunlight without the noise of the street or weather concerns.
Our server was prompt and courteous, taking our order quickly without making us feel hurried. Our plates arrived lightning fast (about five minutes).
My favorite breakfast dish is Eggs Benedict. I figured this would be the perfect place to get my favorite dish, and I was sooo right! It was almost perfect. The English muffins were artisan quality and toasted perfectly. Each one was topped with two slices of ham and a PERFECTLY poached egg. These are no mass-produced, grocery store eggs; they are high quality, farm-fresh eggs with beautiful, rich yolks. All of this was topped with delicious Hollandaise sauce. Here is the only possible issue, and it is actually due to an embarrassment of riches. The eggs need a little bit more sauce, but only because of the richness of the yolks. Once that yolk is released, the Hollandaise is lost. A little extra to balance the dish would be absolute perfection. As it was, this was still the best Eggs Benedict I've ever had (the hash browns were good also). Plus, the orange juice I ordered was fresh squeezed (and I mean FRESH).
One of our favorite desserts is Bananas Foster, so when my wife saw Bananas Foster waffles, she was in. Again; SOOO GOOD! A perfect Bananas Foster draped over waffles that were nice and fluffy inside and perfectly crispy outside. They were served with warm maple syrup in a small ramekin (completely unnecessary) and fresh whipped cream in a sauce boat (completely appreciated).
