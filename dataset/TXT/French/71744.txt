xeFVRUjxorxjO_qjX8FNdw We've been going here for dessert, coffee and the odd dinner for as long as I can remember. In fact, this place will always have a special little place in my heart because it is where I proposed to my wife (this review would have been positive even if she had said no). They have consistently good coffee and it is the only coffee I will drink at night because it is just that good, even though I know I won't be able to sleep. The taste is worth it.

On to the cakes. As soon as you walk in, there is an amazing display of all kinds of cakes right in front of you and IT CHANGES EVERY TIME! Fresh, European-inspired flavours are waiting for you. In addition, there is an extensive menu of other desserts such as crepes, ice cream, gelato, baked Alaska, etc.

Another thing to mention about The Apricot Tree is that the service is second to none. Many of the staff have been there for years and recognize our needs as a family with young kids (they never seat us too close to the door, they provide extra napkins assuming we will need them, etc.)

The cafe is decorated in such a way that it brings the outdoors in, giving the entire place an alfresco feel. A somewhat recent plus is the addition of a wheelchair accessible washroom on the main level. This makes a huge difference for many people I'm sure. The old bathrooms are down a long flight of stairs in the basement.

Before I forget, as of Jan 24 2016 they are now open on Sundays and they have an awesome Sunday brunch/all day breakfast menu. If you are in the area, you simply must check this place out!
