4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Ate here twice while I was in Vegas for a wedding. All of the food I had was absolutely fantastic. I had a chance to sample the filet, salmon and lentils, chicken, chocolate mousse, creme brulee, many bottles of wine, espresso, Ham and cheese crepes, smoked salmon breakfast. Everything was fantastic. I highly recommend this place!
