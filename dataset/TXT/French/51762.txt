PlYrlj86zAYljZTRCBSZ3A This was my first time trying legitimate Canadian poutine. I had the one with duck. In general it was delicious and exceeded my expectations. The portion size was pretty big (which I was thankful for because I was starving that day). The cheese curds were squeaky, which I had heard was what you wanted in good poutine. The gravy was also rich, but maybe a little on the salty side. All in all, I'm pleased with my first experience of poutine!
