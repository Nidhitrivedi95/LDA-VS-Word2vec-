cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg I had high expectations of this place...  
We had a reservation for 4 but when we got there we still had to wait for our table. Ok, no biggie. I knew this place would be a challenge for me since i don't really eat strange animal parts etc. Hmm... let's go with the French Onion soup then, since it's my all time favourite soup on the planet. The waiter assured us that everything on the menu was available. But when i got up from the table, and he came to take our order they said no French Onion soup today. Hmm... the bf did his best to order for me since i wasn't there. Steak & frites it is. Sounds good. We also wanted to get the Oreilles de Crisse, but they didn't have that either. Bummer.
The waiter took forever to bring our wine, we had to remind him a couple times. When we got the wine it was deeelish! YAY! That made me feel better. I also substituted the frites for mashed potatoes, which i had heard were to die for. 
When my meal came the steak was very pink. Ya, i know i know... that's the way you are "supposed" to eat a steak. But I like mine a little more brown and a little less dripping with pink ooze. When i asked to get it done a little more they refused, saying the chef won't cook it any more because it ruins the taste. Hmm, i can try to understand that i guess. But really, I'M the one eating it! So, no, i didn't find it delicious. I only ate around the outside. Meh. The potatoes were really good though.  
For dessert we ordered Pouding Chômeur. It was okay, but i was glad we shared it between the 4 of us. It was really sweet. 
All in all, i could give this place more stars if the service was better, or if maybe they had the food that i wanted. But both left something to be desired...
Meh. Too much hype, i was disappointed.
