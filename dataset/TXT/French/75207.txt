y0cgy0tTh_C8NWCk0WGgjQ HOLLLLLLD A MINUTE, did you say, you gave away my table because I was ten minutes late for a birthday reservation I made a week before, even when I had the courtesy to phone 2 days before to let you know my party of 11 would only be 8?

Th answer is yes.  Saturday night, with a large birthday party and nowhere to go my family and friends abided the horrible service because we did not want to be stranded without restaurant in some other section of the city.  Scrunched up into the dunce's corner of the restaurant, drinkless and stressed, we waited 2 hours for for our table and when we were finally seated, we waited another hour and a half for our mediocre food.  The only item above par in this long anticipated meal was the side order of sweet potato fries and really, who can mess up deep fried and breaded carbohydrates?

From the bottom of my heart, I implore you, do not give this place your business, the food cannot mitigate your upset stomach after its been turned by the obnoxious owner and his sad staff.
