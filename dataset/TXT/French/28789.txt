eJ9L40jm5VOXCIq7xs9kQw We dined at Bonapart on August 12. The street the restaurant is located at is torn up for re-construction, which gives us visitors from California a slight negative initial impression. But we persevered due to great Yelp reviews, and I am delighted we did. Bonapart was first class in every way. The interior is warm and eplegant without being overdone. The food was truly excellent. My wife and I each chose from  their 3 course offering both Fish and Veal were first rate in quality and preparation. The sauce reminded me of the best I have had in France. The service was extremely professional. There is no possible critique I can remotely level against Bonapart
