rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I apologize in advance for the length..
Let's start with the Sunday breakfast. There were 5 girls and we didn't have to wait long. The food and mimosas were delicious. I had their American egg meal. It was a bit pricey but we knew that going in so the bill wasn't a shocker. 
We left full and happy.

Fast forward about 30 minutes later when I realize I left my sunglasses in the booth. These aren't some cheap sunglasses, they are prescription sunglasses so I need them to see in the hot Las Vegas sun and they were expensive. I called the restaurant and spoke with a gentleman who said he found them and would hold them for me there. 
Since the food was so good we decided to have breakfast there again on Tuesday before our flight home. 

Let's review the food on Tuesday morning. There were 7 of us girls now and not one of us really enjoyed the food that day. I had the French Toast with bacon and it was much too sweet. And the bacon which was really good on Sunday was all fat and oily on Tuesday. 

On the way out I inquired about my sunglasses and they said they don't have them. They looked in a drawer and said they weren't in and they are nowhere to be found. I was upset! I would've came straight back if I thought they wouldn't hold them for me. We also wouldn't have spent another $500 for mediocre food that day. So they told me to try lost and found.
We went downstairs and they didn't have them either. They looked in their log and said that nothing had been logged. Somehow they disappeared or got tossed. 
With such a nice upscale place you would think this wouldn't happen. 
And the hostesses couldn't have cared less or been any ruder.

No, I will not be visiting this restaurant again.
