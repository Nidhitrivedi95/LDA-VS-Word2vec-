JezHN-9KKLTMbojq00VP0g Is it possible to have a crush on a restaurant? If so, I have a restaurant crush on Le Petit Triangle. 

I have never had a bad meal or bad service here. Quite the opposite, in fact. Everything I have every had -- including sweet and savory crepes, salads, quiches, entrees, brunch options, coffee, juice, wine, dessert -- has been fresh, flavorful and satisfying. Plus, I just love how the whole space is designed. Though it's a teeny, tiny little space, with an itty, bitty open kitchen and an adorable patio, it feels welcoming and comfortable from the second you approach it. 

Whether it's breakfast, brunch, lunch, dinner, dessert or any other meal, "Petit Triangle" is always a good answer to the question, "where should we go?"
