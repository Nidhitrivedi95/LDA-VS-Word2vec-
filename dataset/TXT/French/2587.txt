0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g Picasso was a good meal, but there are better in Vegas (I had a better meal upstairs at Le Cirque if you are looking for something in the Bellagio)

Reading the Yelp reviews we made sure to get a table near the fountains, but if I were to go again I would request a table on the other side of the service table - the dining was more intimate there.  The fountains are cool, but you can see them from the strip, and during a fine meal they were un-neccessary noise.

Why 3 stars?

While our server was excellent, the service overall felt disorgainized. There were many times that our wine pairing would come out several minutes before the dish (or the option to get wine was only offered after desert was served).  Our personal server had excellent personality and attention, but overall the co-ordination between the front and the back of the house was disjointed and sloppy at this price point.

The wine pairing was the worst I have experienced at this level of dining. Two of the wines served during our meal I can buy at the local Whole Foods for less than $20 a bottle. While the flavors mached the food, the quality did not.  The wine steward should have taken time to understand who we were and serve appropriately (I mentioned that we had a Torrontes when we were on a tasting trip to Mendoza so it did not require as much exclaimation, but this was lost on him). I had to surpress a giggle when he was talking about the paring of Tokaji with Foie Gras (fairly standard if you do not go French). Also, when a pairing with the meal is purchased, it usually includes a pairing with the desert course, We waited for a bit staring at melting ice cream before realizing it would not come out.

The food was good overall, and kept in pace with other fine dining restaurants.
