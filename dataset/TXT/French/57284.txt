rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Ate here 2/13/08. Made reservation at 8:30pm, arrived at 8:35pm and was seated right away. Was busy for a Wednesday night. Elevators to the restaurant was right next to the elevators from the Venetian parking lot so location was convenient. 

We started with the pate for appetizer. Nice big slab of the pate with some radishes, pickles, some green and 3 slices of toast and mustard. I don't think they gave enough toast to go with the amount of pate given, so we used the rest with the complementary bread. Very yummy! 

For entree I ordered the slow cooked short ribs and my partner ordered the pan roasted trout and fries.

The short ribs I heard was slow roasted for 12 hrs! It was incredibly HUGE! It must've weighed a pound at least! It came with creamy polenta as well. It was delicious! Big thick piece of meat, had to take the rest as left overs.

The trout was equally delicious. Not a piece of bone in the fish. It was butterflied very well. Excellent crunch to the roasted almonds too. 

We also ordered cocktails. 2 Grand Cru and 1 Soleil. Grand Cru was delicious, that's why we ordered 2! No room for desserts unfortunately.

Total bill came to $125 for two after taxes and before tips. Not bad for the food and place. It was however loud.
