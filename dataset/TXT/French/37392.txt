j0baDQfMAGDm_QGdFMmb-Q The menu was a little more limited than I would have liked.  I suspect many of the dishes on it are excellent, the one I ordered was less so.  I loved the closeness of the interior and, on a cooler evening, the outside seating looks very inviting.  

For appetizers the mussels were excellent, the escargot only so-so.

For dessert, what's not to like about creme brulee?
