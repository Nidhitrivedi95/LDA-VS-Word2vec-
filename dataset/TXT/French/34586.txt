HojKatUfX4UHWaPqtl63NQ I had been wanting to dine here for a few months already and was excited to finally be able to experience it. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed. The room is beautiful, however, we were seated at a window table and the overhead light was very bright. So instead of being able to see the view, I got a reflection of myself LOL. The food ranged from okay to not good at all. The vitello tonnato (veal carpaccio) tasted like canned tuna. The ox cheek pasta and mushroom risotto were the best of the meal. Everything else was just okay. I gave an extra star because our server, Christopher, was very knowledgeable and professional and the rest of the service was good as well.
