I had the goat cheese salad which was outstanding. My friend is a vegetarian and with no problem the manager accommodated both of us easily. Also, definitely order their bowl of coffee...never seen a coffee that large before! :) 
We sat outside overlooking the strip, while misters sprayed over the railings to keep us cool from the hot sun.
