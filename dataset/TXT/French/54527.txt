rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw Food may appear better than it tastes, at least for me.  After seeing so many delectable photos on Yelp along with the high ratings, I decided that Bardot would be the restaurant of choice to use my dining credit as part of my stay at Aria.  My family and I had brunch here and it was only marginal.  Had better at Mon Ami Gabi.  Food also took too long to come to table which is unacceptable when the restaurant is not even half full at 10am.
