SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA I was surprised by this place- I saw the good reviews but I'm normally not really one for fancy food.  the Wife and I came here to celebrate Cleveland food on our Staycation and really really enjoyed it.  Loved the TERRINE DU CHEF- not pasty like some other pates.  Loved how it came with pickled onions and cornichons.  My wife had the CASSOULET (braised white beans with lamb, duck confit and sausages).  It was hearty, had tons of pieces of meat and sausage in a wonderful earthy, beany sauce.  Very french and plenty to mop up with the delicious crusty bread.  We don't normally order dessert but we were on a roll so we ordered the Meyer Lemon Tart.  It was beautiful, carmelized peaks of meringue on top.  The lemon curd was a little soupy but I'll forgive it because it was otherwise delicious.  To top it off it was not too expensive for what you got.  Service was outstanding.  We will be back.
