ovtlrcsVRlgZZQUlHs_ovw Oh Vogue!  Went for my 3rd visit and still undeniably awesome!!!  Not only is the food AMAZING, the service is fantastic!  I have sampled several apps, sides, entrees and daily specials.  Seafood, from the oysters to the swordfish=phenomenal!  I will continue to go back to Vogue for any special occasion.  It is pricey, be prepared, but completely worth every cent.  Don't forget to tip your servers & bartenders :)
