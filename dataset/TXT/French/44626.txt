mnn--vaYHtNyBNYFYBFIog I can't figure out how this place gets good reviews!
Obviously people coming form a burger culture would think this joint has good food otherwise it makes no sense. 
People, paying big $$$ does NOT make the food good!!
They do have good service, (although very "mechanical" as if following an exact list of things to do) and a decent wine list, but the chef should REALLY stick to hot-dogs or poutines!
Cold, dry, tasteless plates, that do indeed look good, however lack any type of taste. 
Also, the ambiance is rather dry,(like the food) lacking any type of background music.
They do have amazingly good cocktails.
Do yourself a favor, go for the mixed cocktails, run like hell anywhere else for food!!
