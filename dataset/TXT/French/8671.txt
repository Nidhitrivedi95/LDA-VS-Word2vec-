4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Cozy French bistro offering savory and delectable breakfast, brunch and dinner. Had spinach and got geese omelet sever with crispy hash brown and crispy toast with sautéed green beans. Fluffy and soft with perfect seasoning and fresh coffee made it a perfect mid-morning pick me up meal. The patio would have been the ideal spot to eat but the wait was long so we settled for the inside table which was nice too. It was a satisfying meal .
