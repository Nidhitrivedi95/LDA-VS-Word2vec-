4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw One of my favorite restaurants in Vegas, especially for steak and frites!  

Steak cooked perfectly, had both the bone in and filet mignon, the fries are thin and crunchy (how I like it) and appetizers were good too. Tried the seafood crepe, salmon tar tar, and oysters. 

One thing I really appreciate is that this place is not too expensive in comparison to other steakhouses on the strip - my opinion.
