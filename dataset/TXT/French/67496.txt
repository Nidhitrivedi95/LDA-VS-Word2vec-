UxWH8zRYIBgs6Q2oykvRdw Four of us went on Sunday April 12th, 2015 for brunch/late lunch. First, it is in the beautiful unique distillery district. The restaurant interior is absolutely stunning and grand. I felt like I went to Paris today. Our server Anthony was very pleasant and friendly. Food was amazing. We had the $1 oyster each with champagne. Great way to start the meal. Then some of the mains we had were eggs benedicts, smoked salmon omelette, poutine. Not only the presentation of the dishes were beautiful, but also the taste. I would also like to add that the skinny fries that came with some of the dishes were some of the best fries I have ever had. 
More importantly, there was a miscommunication with the sandwich special of the day from our server. I think the kitchen just changed the special. Long story short, when the sandwich arrived, it wasn't what we were told earlier. When Anthony realized it, he handled it very professionally. He apologized and made sure we got the correct sandwich. It's situation like this that shows a great restaurant from an ok restaurant. 
Finally, I sometimes fear going into these beautiful high end restaurant that the servers sometimes have some attitude. I must say Cluny striked the perfect note with their staff -- professional yet pleasant and friendly. 
I would recommend this restaurant to anyone.
