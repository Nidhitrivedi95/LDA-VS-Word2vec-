_T7f2wUgNlJqxsR-cR89SQ A friend and I came here for Lobsterlicious a couple of years ago.

There were some good dishes:
+ butter-poached lobster: cauliflower puree with puntarelle and shaved fennel, smoked bacon butter sauce
+ lobster bisque
+ crème brûlée: flavored with bourbon madagascar vanilla beans, raspberry sorbet and langue de chat biscuits

There were some bad dishes:
- lobster and farfalle rigate: leeks, spinach and chard, with lobster tarragon sauce
- pan-roasted sea scallop (too salty, too much lemon zest)
- frozen hazelnut parfait with brown butter snap cookies (not frozen enough, too nutty)

And then there was a really terrible one: venison loin. It's supposed to be one of their best dishes, but it was waaaaaaaay too salty.

Really great waiters/waitresses though - or maybe that's just Canada (people here are ridiculously nice and friendly)! I'll probably be back to give Scaramouche another try.
