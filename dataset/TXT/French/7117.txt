4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Made a reservation for 4 on a Sunday night at 7:15 - sat down immediately on the patio with a beautiful view of the Bellagio water show across the street. Tried a little bit of everything my family ordered.

Salmon: seasoning was right on. According to mom, cauliflower was delicious.

Rib eye: massive but cooked exactly how my dad wanted it. Seasoning was just like the salmon - right on.

Beef wellington (Sunday only): first time I've had it so i don't know how it's supposed to taste, but it was juicy.

Steak with peppercorn sauce: steak was alright - it was a skirt type. Didn't really like the sauce, but that's a personal preference thing. Frites were crispy and complemented the meat well.

French onion soup: flavors inside worked well. Very cheesy.

Bread: always warm, butter was right texture.

Overall, pretty good. I would come back.
