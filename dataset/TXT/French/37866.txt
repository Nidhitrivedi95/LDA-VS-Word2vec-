jaSowNITPRRCYpPb3_pjdA Not sure I could have been more underwhelmed by the experience at Andre's Bistro and Bar. The only thing positive I can say is there was a warm greeting when we walked in and our busser was attentive when it came to refilling our water. 

That being said, the overall service was bummer. Our waiter took our order, ran over to tell us that if we wanted the soufflé we had to put the order in RIGHT AWAY, and that was the last time we saw him. 

Our cheese plate came out on a fly by with no explanation of what was on it. I had to flag someone down to ask what some of the accompaniments were. Then our entrees with the same drop off. 

The ribeye I ordered looked a lot more like the "flat iron" they had on the menu and was cooked all the way through. (Ordered medium rare)... I've seen better steaks on IHOP commercials. My wife's ricotta gnocchi came out surrounded by a messy plate of inedible bitter greens and a mint "paste." 

If you're thinking "why didn't you send it back" I didn't see anyone again until our water glasses were empty and wasn't going to just sit there until someone noticed us. 

I did wind up flagging down our busser again, this time to pay, after we sat there for another 10 minutes after finishing our meal. 

Maybe it was an off night as I have heard good things about Andre's but if so, it was a James Harden level off night.
