_cjPEH9wXhKS-HQe_U3M4Q food was good but a little underwhelming. 
the usual brunch/lunch menu items were not available...on s Saturday afternoon. 
duck confit, foie gras toast etc. 
everything on the menu was really mediocre and not very impressive. 
the lamb burger i had was good and the fries were tasty, but i really wanted more authentic french choices or even more interesting ones...
good but not great
