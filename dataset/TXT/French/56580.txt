rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A This must be the worst of any of Thomas Keller's restaurants.  I'm sad to say I can't find anything positive to say about the experience.  Strike that ... the decor of this place is nice ... but pretty typical of Vegas standards.  The location within the Venetian is hideous ... I mean you practically have to navigate a maze to get to this place.  The service ... decent, but, sometimes slow.  They're friendly and polite, but sometimes seem to forget about you.  The food ... unexciting and frankly unreliable.  Go there a few separate times, and I can almost gurantee you that it'll be a different experience each time.  Anyone can be good once in a while.  But great restaurants are reliable.  Its unfortunate, but, I feel like this location doesn't do Mr. Keller's other restaurants any justice.
