epvLkQNL6MOvk3s6JlTntA We went for dinner on a Sunday night. We were three of five customers in the restaurant, which was off-putting. I guess they only just started serving dinner as well as breakfast and lunch. It would be a really great dinner joint if they dimmed the lights a little and played some romantic French music (instead of Johnny Cash... a bit much for nighttime).

The crepes were great. The service was great. Our server (#7? possibly the owner?) was quite jolly. I'll go again sometime.
