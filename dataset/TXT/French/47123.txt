O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q We had the tomahawk steak dinner. Hubby's wants today. It was cooked very well and since it was for our anniversary dinner, they gave us some complimentary champagne. And when the dust bunnies flew off the ceiling fan, pre-meal mind you, onto our table and into my eyes (the first time I've worn contacts in 3 yrs!) they offered to move us. :) The service was outstanding. We even had dessert which we never do. Creme brulee trio. Attire is dressy nice -- preppy shorts and polo shirts to cocktail dresses and suits.
