6fPQJq4f_yiq1NHn0fd11Q Maybe I'm spoiled with having tried crepes in France but this place brought me down a little.

My girls and I were very excited to have breakfast at this place on our first morning in Las Vegas. Sadly, we were met by a long line which did not seem to shorten at all, thanks to only one working cook and two crepe grills. Assuming that every customer orders 1-2 crepes each, it is not surprising that the service was very slow. I ended up waiting for 15 minutes to get one crepe. 

The portion is pretty general, though. One crepe is definitely split-able between 2 people. 

Moreover, I think they lack some serious variety of crepes. There are only about 6 kinds for each of the sweet and savory crepe categories. And none of them specifically sounded appetizing to me. I ended up ordering one sweet and one savory crepes.

Granted that it is very hard to screw things up with chocolate, this place has miraculously produced crepes that were too sweet and creamy for my taste. I felt a bit queasy afterwards. 

Nothing was absolutely terrible, but the service could have definitely been faster. But would I pay $10 to eat at this place again? Probably not.
