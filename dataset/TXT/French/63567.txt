t1mR_Zff6Dqv1TueE2JLEA So bad.  I'm a native from Morocco and this reminded me of a fast food chain that overcooked everything to well done.  But it wasn't "well done" it was horrible and disgusting.  The prices were also extremely expensive for the poor quality and poor service. Avoid like the plague...
