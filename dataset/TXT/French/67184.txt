USleI8g1UVN9-9jm-b4uIg Man... I must be on a different level on this one because everyone seems to be bat-shit crazy about this place.  Don't get me wrong, I though it was okay.  I've heard about the Fig Tree over and over (and OVER) again since I moved here... so finally, for our Anniversary we decided to get all dolled up and experience it for ourselves.

The waitstaff was very kind and attentive, the food selection was okay - but there was nothing innovative, nothing that blew me away.  And I guess maybe my expectations were just too high...  but for me the best part of the meal was the salad.  My beau said the same thing.

He got the steak, I got the chicken special.  I wasn't crazy about the chicken so I asked for a box to take it home.  No joke we put the to-go box in the car and it smelled so horrendous we stopped the car the throw it out.  A $30 meal!

I'm going to give 3 stars because even though my experience wasn't great, obviously I missed something... so maybe it was me.  At the end of the day I wouldn't go out of my way to go back here, but if someone's heart was set on it I would try it again.  I would rather spend my money somewhere incredible.
