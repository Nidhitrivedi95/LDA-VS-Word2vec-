1ThbwFVBL9YA2oOM11iO7g The Cuban sandwich was super tasty. We're visiting from out of town and were taken here by our local friends. I really liked the atmosphere and the service was great....we did have to wait for water refills a few times, but the waiters were obviously slammed and doing the best they could so it wasn't a major demerit. We got a Cuban to share for the table as an app and I got the roast chicken as my main.  We got the fresh baked cookies for dessert as well as this interesting peach and cream thing. The cookies were gooey and warm, but not the best cookies I've had. Didn't stop me from eating them though! The peach dessert was a really interesting complex dish. I'm not usually a fan of fruit desserts but you could tell a lot of thought and effort went into it's creation, which I can appreciate.  Overall I really enjoyed our meal here and would come back...
