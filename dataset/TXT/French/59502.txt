RZk_PE-H9SygqwSQd88cWQ Friends and I lunched at Le Grand Comptoir, a pleasant bistro in Phillips Square. The owner greeted us, seating us at a table by the window. 

Their menu is typical French but their cooking is anything but. To start, we shared a plate of escargot with artichokes (C$7.95), deliciously finished in a creamy sauce, and an order of the pate du jour (C$5.95). My pork cutlet was seasoned just right, was quite good, coming with a side of fries. I decided against wine[1].

Service at Le Grand Comptoir was great, and it's easy to recommend them for a satisfying French repast.

[1]I had imbibed copious drink the night before, so a glass of apple juice kept me company instead.
