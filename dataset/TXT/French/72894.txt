XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q First of all I dined here with high expectation since I heard from my friends and I'm so excited when I knew that I will visit Las Vegas and made reservation in advance. Me and three of my friends ( one came here before) , we decided to have 15 courses and totally price come out $600 each person. I 've been to many 3 stars restaurants and used to work in the kitchen as a chef, foods here are absolutely delicious and presentation in each dish is so beautiful. The reason that I reduced one star because of service , they didn't change the utensils when we finished the first course , my wine finished and no one pour to my glass also I feel  a bit racist and a bit look down ( we are Asians) and they managed to sit all the Asian people zone( hostess seated the couple of white and they already ordered after that they whisper to the waiter and then they change their table to the next zone that I noticed that only white people sit there). Finally the dessert car come ,they didn't allow us to pick ( one of my friend that came here before told me that you can pick whatever you want and they will give you a loaf of bread for souvenir that is the best past) but we didn't get that( why???). Bottom line I might come here with high expectation and this dinner is the most expensive of my life so I need the great memory.
