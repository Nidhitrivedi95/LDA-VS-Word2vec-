w2tr0PA0b3tg8pId0kjM-A I tried 6 macaroon flavors and I'll try to remember them all - Lavender, Violet, Pistachio, White Chocolate Basil, Earl Grey and Rose.  Out of those, I enjoyed the Pistachio and Earl Grey the most.  

I've had macroons from Laduree and I can't even compare the two - Laduree is on a completely other (heavenly) level from most of the macroons I've ever tasted.  The ones from Gaby Et Jules were ok, a bit too creamy in the middle for my taste and I didn't always feel that the flavors were true to taste.  For example, I've had amazingly good Rose macaroons before but if I hadn't rememberd I ordered a Rose macroon I would have never guessed that the flavor was Rose.  Same with many of the other flavors including Lavender and Violet.  

I wasn't a huge fan of the White Chocolate Basil but I thought the Pistachio and Earl Grey were 4 star worthy.  6 macrooons will set you back $13.00 - which is on par with other high end pastry places.
