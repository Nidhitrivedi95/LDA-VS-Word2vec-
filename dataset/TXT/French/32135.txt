gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA I had one of the best meals of my life here. As others have mentioned, the view is spectacular. We were seated by the window, which accentuated that part of our experience. The service is excellent from the moment you step off the "private" elevator to the time you leave. Our server was knowledgeable and friendly, and the sommelier did an excellent job of talking us through the offerings.

I had the roasted lobster, which no longer seems to be on the menu. That's a shame. It's much simpler than the thermidor, and delivered a strong lobster flavor with just a hint of char. I had the bone marrow appetizer, which was luxurious, topped with the same sort of garlic butter served with the escargot (also wonderful). One of my companions had the onion soup, which she adored.

Since it was my birthday, I received a special key which opened a birthday gift at the end of the meal. A truffle, not a new car, but much more delicious.

My meal at Alize was more than a year ago (sometimes these reviews lag!), and more recent reviews seem less enthusiastic. All the basic of food and service were there on my visit, and I can't imagine it's changed much. Highly recommended.
