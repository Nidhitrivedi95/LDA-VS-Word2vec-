hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA I discovered Baguette Cafe through yelpers when I was moving to Vegas and I am so glad I did. This is a hidden gem that is growing fast producing the best quiches and and croissants. Their quiches selection varies and they are always delicious. And if it wasn't enough, they have great coffee and an even better service. Absolutely French, absolutely worth it
