el-3IdlW3bTCSnquLvH-3w If I was blindfolded, seated and my blindfold was taken off, I would have sworn I was in France!  The decor and ambiance is very French.  I went in to meet someone for coffee and Croissant.  The croissant came fresh out of the oven, so delicate and the coffee was magnificent, perfect! The food that came by our table to other patrons looked and smelled deeeeeeelish as well! The owners and chef were all so gracious and service oriented and most of all, so passionate about what they do.  Their French accents added to the experience, so authentic...wonderful!!!  Truly a little part of France right here in Scottsdale!
