rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Since reservation at the French Laundry takes eons, Bouchon is definitely the way to sample Keller's dishes.  Everyone at our table enjoyed their meals and gasped as each course was presented.  Our server was attentive and pleasant.  The room can get a bit too loud, but it just adds up to the electrifying atmosphere (for this foodie, at least).
