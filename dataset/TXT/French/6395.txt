4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw The food and view are great. Breakfast here is a good idea for the tourist. The Brie and Apple Crepe is not something to pass up on. Soft flavor that is just perfect. I could have done without the fake accents, but after a while it normalizes. For dinner I got the Seared Salmon. The sweet pea sauce is delicious. And to top it off, Bellagio Fountains are right in view. For dessert, stay away from the Apple Tarte, it was soggier than expected and the vanilla whip only made the sogginess worse. Would have preferred a scoop of ice cream or something similar. 

Overall, great place, great food, great atmosphere. Cafe Mocha is delicious too.
