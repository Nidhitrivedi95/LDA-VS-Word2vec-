hloS23Thw57IITw7_DLLOQ It was a Tuesday night and a blizzard was on its way to Montreal, so basically the streets were pretty dead. But, since it was the end of our business trip in Montreal, we decided to go out for dinner, but something with a French flare.
The conceirge at our hotel recommended to us Le Parchemin, but also suggested that we reserve a table ahead of time, which we didn't, but found out we didn't really need to when we got there. Perhaps because of the storm, or the fact that it was a Tuesday evening, the restaurant was pretty empty, except for a few couples out on dates (which is a good sign.)
Located inside an old Presbyterian church in the heart of Montreal, the ambiance is very elegant and not at all swanky. They had an extensive wine list, and also offered a special "Gourmet Dinner" package that includes soup, salad, main course, dessert and coffee/tea for CA$44.95, which is a good deal for this class of restaurant. (Wine of course is extra. ) 
The lobster bisque soup was fantastic, and I ordered the filet mignon with the black pepper and Port sauce that was extremely moist and tender.  For dessert they had the Parchemin trilogy, which consisted of three small tarlets for three of us to share. The portions were right and I felt full but not overstuffed as I usually do with French cuisine. The service was excellent as well, and the Maitre D, Juan Comas, was extremely kind and even came to speak with us a bit. 
I recommend this restaurant for both as a date-night option or a group fare.
