You may find yourself tempted to source the same goods at the Starbucks chain next door - and the staff there are usually lovely, so you wouldn't be making a big mistake - but I'm a local spot gal at heart, and that's a big part of why this place has mine. I love seeing all the staff here making soup and quiche, stacking freshly made sandwiches in the display case, and filling bowls with various salads to order. 

This space is big and airy but also cozy and vaguely Parisian inside. You can usually find your standard mix of laptop workers, meeting takers, and friends meeting for a coffee and catch-up. So go ahead, check it out. I was pleasantly surprised by Le Gourmand and I bet you will be too.
