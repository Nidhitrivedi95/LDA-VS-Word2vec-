O66Zy8Y13VBm72ZDhS4fIg I was alone on a saturday night and decided to go to a bar in my neighbourhood. With Hemingways in mind, the thought soon soured as I got closer on Cumberland and thought of getting bombarded by single older men while sipping on overly sweet coloured cocktails served by big boobed waitresses (no offence Hemingways). It was then the sound of the piano playing which lulled me into a hypnotic trance that pulled me into the bar of Sassafraz. The thought of dining alone personally scares me, but here i felt completely comfortable, and safe, being a female drinking alone. 
I got the french martini, and a bellini, the latter being pleasantly sweet and bubbly. 

I came again for lunch during winterlicious and had a similarly pleasant experience. I sat in the main dining room, which is a little bit uptight and outdated looking with everything padded in white leather so you may feel as though you are being admitted to an institution.
My date had the soup, roast chicken and apple compote - enjoyed it all
I had the salmon tartar, short ribs, and chocolate malt cake.
The presentation for everything was stellar. The salmon tartar was accompanied with pomegranate puree, which was a complementing sweetness to the saltiness of the fish. The beef was on the fattier side, and the chocolate malt cake was simply a brownie. But its winterlicious and it was $25 per person, so all is forgiven, for the price we were beyond satisfied. 
The staff is also impressively trained, and really shame other Toronto restaurants regarding customer service.
