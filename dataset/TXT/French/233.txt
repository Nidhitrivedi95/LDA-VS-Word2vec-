-4TMQnQJW1yd6NqGRDvAeA Just had dinner here tonite.  We also had dinner there 10 days ago.  Maybe we should have thought twice and went to another place but the ambience is so nice and on a gorgeous nite here....why not.  I know why not.  We had the mall plate of meatballs and gnocchi....mediocre at best.  I don't know what seasoning they used in the sauce, but my Italian relatives would be modified.  I had the pork belly and it was good, a bit dried out, but it's what they put with it, that was a total turn off.  Cabbage was not good and they had some fronds of the fennel, with hardly any fennel, and some mini mystery vegetable.  There was no taste to any of the veggies.  Husband had the duck both times and enjoyed it.  The fist was the choice of our friends.  They enjoyed it, but didn't like the lentil under the fish.  The prices might be a bit high for very small portions.  The thought of Brussel sprout salad sounded enticing but the taste wasn't exciting....lacked any definition of flavor or seasoning.  Quite boring! The restaurant is OK, but not a rush-to-go-back type of place!
