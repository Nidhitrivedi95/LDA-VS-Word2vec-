I ordered a caesar salad and within what seemed like five minutes it was on the table. It was delicious, I loved the cheese and dressing. I also ordered the classic quiche lorraine. I'm a big sucker for quiche, my grandmother made it countless times for me when I was little and I have to say eating this quiche sent me back to my childhood. It was AMAZING..and incredibly filling. I couldn't even finish all of it!

Our waiter was very friendly and attentive. Not only that but the food comes out so quickly that I barely had time to finish my caesar salad before my lunch was served. My boyfriend got the warm chicken and brie sandwich. It had thin slices of apple and caramelized onions on top. Absolutely delicious.  All in all a great experience, great food and an elegant yet not pretentious atmosphere. When we go back to Vegas we will definitely be dining here again.
