T4g4k2OhCTsiqcP-ZXElHQ I've always been vocal about my love for French food and restaurants. Jules is no exception to this rule. It's cozy, bustling at lunch, authentically French, from the servers to the chefs to the owner who speak to each other en francais and make you feel a bit like you've escaped across the pond despite being right in the hub of Toronto on Spadina. 

Great for lunch or dinner, a date or dinner with friends, or just a glass of wine at the bar by the kitchen to chat with the staff. I have fond memories of all these instances here. Plus take out for lunch! A small patio in the warmer months - what more can you ask for?

The quiches are lovely and reasonably priced with salade verte, soupe or frites! Ooooo la la, the frites here are amazing!!!!! Perfectly salted, soft on the inside a bit cripsy on the outside, this girl's favourite kind! I'm not a mayo fan but my friends that are adore this side with their fries. I admit, I've gone there more than once at lunch just for these! 

Mussels are tasty as are the salads - Niçoise being my pick. Crêpes, steak frites, and of course no French menu is complete without a croque monsieur (and many other tasty sandwiches) - Jules has something for everyone. Even this veggie has options between quiches, sandwiches and salads. 

The wine list is small but lovely. By the glass, half litre or bottle. Not fancy but elegantly upscale. J'aime Jules!
