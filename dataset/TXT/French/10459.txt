[frisee & warm bacon salad with soft-poached egg, croutons] 
-- absolutely delicious! the poached egg is an amazing addition and actually emulsifies the dressing - yum.

[sea scallops, butternut squash puree, brussels sprouts, hazelnuts, brown butter]
-- scallops were cooked perfectly, large portion but needed more salt. Squash was good but a bit bland and the brussels sprouts ok.
