rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w The food was good but first impression was a disappointment. Our reservation was at 8pm on a busy holiday weekend. We got there 5 mins early so we were instructed to wait wish was to be expected. The waiting area was already packed with people, but we saw a few tables available inside and a couple by the waiting area. We still didn't hear from the hostess by 8:25pm, so I complained. She didn't seem apologetic and proceeded to seat us at one of the tables by the waiting area that has been empty the whole time we were waiting... Really?!? 

The service after that was great and the food was good. But to pay the price they're charging, I expected much more.
