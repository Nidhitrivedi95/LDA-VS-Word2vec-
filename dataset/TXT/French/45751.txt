mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q Talk about FINE DINING! Luckily we just strolled in here and got a table immediately without a reservation.

Decor:
Fancy, modern. There's seating around the kitchen, so you can watch all the chefs making your dishes. It's fun to watch!

Food:
We ordered the tasting menu, which consisted of what seemed like an endless number of courses. I felt like food just kept coming out nonstop! At some point, I gave up trying to remember the dishes and how many courses we ate because it required too much brainpower. The food was DELECTABLE. Joel Robuchon definitely knows how to please the palate.

My one disappointment was the bread. It was too dry. Felt like someone just doused my mouth with powder. The cheese, however, was delicious.

Wine:
Great wine selection, however, my liver wouldn't have been able to handle another glass of liquor from the weekend, so I decided to pass. 

Service:
PERFECT. Everything was well paced and taken care of without either of us having to request anything.  They gave very detailed, elaborate  description of every entree they dropped off, but I kind of zoned out because I didn't know like 60% of the terms they used.
