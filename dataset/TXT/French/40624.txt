KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA Amazing beautiful scenery! You don't feel like you're in Vegas! I know it's a French wine restaurant, I just feel like portions are small and not enough variety.... Turkey sandwich is really good!! Staff is nice.... Wish I could afford to try the wines!!!! Maybe next date night.... But, will have to wait for it to cool down... Sitting outside is a must!
