1iDBWrwjfk4w_ThhL_qTYQ Can you give a restaurant no stars, because I can't even give them 1.  Restaurant week and I was so excited when I looked at the menu for this event.  The escargot was like eating rubber snails, they came in ramekins with gravy poured over them that tasted like a fake package made gravy and were served cold! Yuk! What happened to the garlic butter?  When we complained the waiter took them away and a few minutes later brought the same dishes half eaten and passed them around the table, each one of us got the other ones half eaten dish and we were shuffling them around the table to get the ones we originally started with.  So what they did was take our dishes that we ate into, put them into something to heat them up and brought the same dishes back which made the snails even more rubbery.  Now comes the main course, we ordered the scallops, there were only 2 the size of a quarter on top of a very nasty burnt eggplant concoction also on the plate was risotto and lobster sauce except it appeared to be white rice put into a cup and turned upside down on the plate with the same fake package made gravy poured over top.  For $44 per person, I don't think so; I will never go back there.
