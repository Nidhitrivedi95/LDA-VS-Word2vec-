uTCOEqjuVAXUOzti5TWj2Q The Crepe Club was a fabulous experience. We had the strawberry crepe and it was great. The staff loved our daughters and were so friendly, playing with them and giving them samples. The manager then came out and gave them the croissant they were going nuts over and said he loved their smiles and had to give them the pastry. It was genuinely thoughtful and he seemed so happy to make our girls day. I definitely recommend checking it out if you're in the mood for some crepes!
