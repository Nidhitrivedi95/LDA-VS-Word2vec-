QeFsIMcIFIJcOrpthYL8jg Came between lunch and dinner. We had the poutine (not a fan in general but good), the bolognese (delicious) with handmade pasta, steak and fries and homemade bread. Definitely delicious, food service and would definitely recommend. Not sure how lunch and dinner work, I think it's reservation only, but at the time we came, it was definitely a great experience.
