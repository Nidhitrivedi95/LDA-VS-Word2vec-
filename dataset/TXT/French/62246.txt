SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ This is one of my wife and my favorite places to go for any occasion, or none at all. We've been going there for the better part of 20 years. When I handled international sales, I would often take clients from overseas here, and it was not unusual for them to ask to go there again when they returned to the Phoenix area. You can dine inside or out. I would recommend outside. During warm times, misters keep the area comfortable, and during cooler nights, portable propane heaters do the same. 

The service and cuisine are consistently outstanding. I highly recommend their Rack of Lamb, Osso Buco, Salmon and their steaks. There are too many great main entrees, salads and appetizers to mention here, so check out their menu online. Also wonderful cocktails and deserts - both solid and liquid.

Whether you want to impress a client, entertain friends, or celebrate a special occasion (as we did with our anniversary on this day), or simply just have a great dinner out, you can't go wrong with the House of Tricks.
