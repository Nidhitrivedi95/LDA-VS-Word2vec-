ytD9rJ-jcb8zMUCfiYCnFw This place had some of the best eggs benedict ever!! The fresh orange juice was phenomenal also!  There was five of us and everyone said it was the best breakfast they ever had!!  The server was very cool and friendly too.  Not sure why some of these people are rating this place so low.  It was a hidden gem, and i am glad we found it!!
