ZgiSgTwHOoxdfi0unI36Mg The Gazette is attached to the Westin hotel and while some of our friends staying with us got to be at breakfast early in the morning and had drinks late at night, I only got to sample from the dessert menu. 

I loved their bread pudding. I am a sucker for bread pudding, I love everything about bread pudding. And this was great. It was warm, there was a caramel boozy sauce too and omg, I loved it. 

The service was oh so very slow and it was quite annoying. We were sitting for a good 10 minutes before someone took our order, and it took well over 15 minutes for our desserts to come, and another 10 minutes for the check. That was too long, way too long. Especially given that there was almost no one at the restaurant at that time. Bread pudding, great tho!
