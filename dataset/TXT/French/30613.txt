fVF5wayDyY6ZR5oJB1IK3g We beat the rush and got seated close to opening time for brunch at Lawrence.

We started with some delicious stuffed donuts (stuffed with vanilla cream, Nutella, and lemon curd).

I had the ham, cheese, and fried egg on toast which was mouthwatering. The bread was so thick and the egg was cooked perfectly.
I also tried my husband's scrapple, fried eggs, and bacon (which I really enjoyed, although he didn't).
