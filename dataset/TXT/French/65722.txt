Went with my in laws (including my French Canadian mother in law), and the owner greeted us (her in French),and recommended amazing wine. Amazing wine makes me happy.
Food was delicious. I got the duck confit and I still dream about it. 
A little pricey, but you get what you pay for!

Would definitely go here again.
