AHosGBveeXx9YjsQvdJgeg Food and service were great,but i made valentines reservations over a week in advance and got sat behind a beam/wall and was disappointed that me and my wife's view  were obstructed,felt like i was in the cheap seats,when we spent the same if not more than others with better seats.other tables were open so don't think it was overbooked.
