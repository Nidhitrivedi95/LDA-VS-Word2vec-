rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw My husband booked a reservation here because we love Steak Frites. We both had the flat iron cut- one medium well, one medium rare. My husbands steak was under cooked- rare. While we thought the meal was pretty good overall, our friends who ordered the same we're not pleased.
