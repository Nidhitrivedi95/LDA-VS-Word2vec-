XbG4OgFoaSIxQxVRhTxU2w Definitely worth a visit.  We trekked to this corner of the city on a recent trip based on the Unique Eats segment and other Yelp reviews.  The place has a magnetic charm.  The open kitchen and casually chic decor welcome you into the restaurant.  Soon thereafter you find there's a certain playfulness to the menu.
   
The Japanese tacos were outstanding, as was the wine suggested by our waitress.  I wish the taco portion was split among two shells instead of large one,  and I really wish that soft corn tortillas were used instead of the hard version (it cracks and was a little greasy).  The chile rellenos and cod were both boldly flavorful.

Side note:  The chef is dedicated to serving only sustainably caught fish; a decision the demands a lot of creativity and shows a lot of thoughtfulness.  Many thanks to you!
