ucgzkl7atsBMGu4gGpmHfw We have eaten at Peter Pan four or five times.  I like the unpretentious and relaxed atmosphere and the casual but attentive service.  The menu is not spectacular but its good fare with good portions and at very reasonable prices.  Recommended for pre theater or a pleasant dinner after shopping on queen west.  We always sit in the old church pews next to the old fashion par.
