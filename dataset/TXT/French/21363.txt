B56AYe5GNuavMDtwFsXqzA I dined here with a group of 4 girls and we each got different entrees so that we could share.   We ordered the foie gras and duck fat curry fries as appetizers and the following entrees:  sea bass, diver scallops, duck with chickpeas, and croquet madame papadelle.  

I really liked the foie gras, although its not the best I've had.  It's a very tiny portion that they give you, so if you're sharing with foie gras lovers, best to get 2 orders.  Thankfully, no liked it as much as me so I ate most of it.  I liked everyone else's food except mine - the croquet madame papadelle.  I was hungry and didn't read the description thoroughly and didn't bother to ask the waiter to explain the dish so I pretty much ordered something that was different than what I thought it would be... my fault :/  Other than that, scallops were cooked perfectly, sea bass was flakey in a good way, duck with chickpeas = delish. 

I feel like the service I received here should be the standard for all high end restaurants - I've been to way more expensive places than Petite Maison and received not so great service.
And usually, I don't really care about "service", because if you read a lot of my reviews, I tend to really focus more on food than who is bringing me my food.  But if I'm spending 50+ on my meal, it's just kind of a given that I'm paying for the experience as well. With that said, our waiter was very nice.  Not the overbearing, hovering type.  He explained the menu thoroughly and didn't annoy us.  Maybe we just got the pick of the litter that night, haha.  That or they train their staff very well.

We ended the meal with a chocolate souffle that came with a raspberry sauce - the dessert as a whole was not too sweet which was a good thing.  I guess it just tasted like a very moist chocolate cake with... raspberry sauce.  =D

Oh yeah.  And the ambiance...   there's something about dimmed lights, candles and french words you can't read.  :)
