rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Came here for brunch and had a small wait. Got seated outside without being asked our preference of indoor or outdoor. As the sun moved in the summer afternoon it became quite punishing.
The food overall was good though. I had the mussels and my wife had the ham and cheese with the egg on top. Both dishes go to show that although simple, with high quality ingredients you can create an amazing meal. For the price, there was plenty of food so I think it has a good value.
