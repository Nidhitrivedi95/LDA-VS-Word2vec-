Tefx_N6A6nrsdj4jHHnbYg You don't have to twist my arm to get me into a French bakery. The Allure of a freshly made macaron is enough. 

A super cute little venue amongst the medical center off of 215 and Durango. This little cafe has coffee lunch and pastries all made in in-house... Except for the butter croissants which are imported from France! Everything was superb. I would recommend a French press coffee over an espresso, as I could tell they are more of a bakery than a coffee shop. A perfect place to wait on your medical records, meet someone, or celebrate with a macaroon after you find out that your suspicious mole is benign!
