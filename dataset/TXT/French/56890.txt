rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A C'est delicieux!!!!!

We had breakfast here and loved it!!!  The decor is very simple but elegant- try to sit with the view of the fountain.  The staff was very helpful and the food was to DIE for.  

I had the Croque Madame which was better here than any I've had in Paris- the fries are reallllly good.
We also had, at the table, the Salmon baguette, Les Oeufs au gratin and the omelette special of the day- all were great and the coffee was fantastic.  

I definitely recommend it!!
