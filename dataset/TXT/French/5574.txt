I heard of this place some time ago, but never had the opportunity to stop by during one of my many trips to Montreal.  We took that walk over from our hotel on a rainy night and were greeted by the friendly staff and sat immediately.

The starters were so-so - 3 start worthy on their own - but still tasty and enjoyable.  The gaspacho was fresh, but a bit too spicy for the two of us that had it.  The escargot (served in a cast iron pot) were tasty, but maybe a tad bit oily.  The bread served at the table is worthy of 5 stars, however, and is served with a great, fatty french butter.

The mains were simply excellent.   Two of us had the beef bourguignon special of the week, which was some of the best B.B. that I've every tasted - it was simply amazing.  Another had the hanger steak frites, which was cooked perfectly.  Our other friend had a classic Salade Nicoise, which had large pieces of perfectly-grilled tuna.

This is a cute place.  The atmosphere is great, the service is friendly and it has a great wine list.  Unfortunately, it was a cold and rainy spring day, but I can imagine that it's even better when its front garage door opens up onto the pedestrian street out front.
