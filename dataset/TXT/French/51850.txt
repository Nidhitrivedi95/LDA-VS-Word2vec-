pmoIMK8zGWvKsVOPDBYfzg This review is only for the cigar bar upstairs: but it is TERRIFIC!!

Such a nice, sophisticated, classy atmosphere. 

Great classic blues music playing at a reasonable volume.

Very well ventilated, so the gentlemen can enjoy their cigars and the ladies can still breath comfortably.

Nice whiskey and cognac selection. 

A top notch cocktail menu and a wonderful place to go for drinks and to escape the rest of Monte Carlo, which is not worthy of such a fine establishment. We will come here again and again.
