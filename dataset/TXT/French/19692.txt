aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw WOW! The croissants here were flaky and buttery--something I'd always read about what a good croissant should be, but had never really experienced it until I had one at this bakery. It was so heavenly, and I could've ordered a half dozen or so to have for myself. Luckily, I exercised some self-control. Also had the caramel (ok), orange (yummy), raspberry (yummier) and chocolate (yummiest) macarons here. They were soft, chewy and very tasty. The piece de resistance and the 'signature' Bouchon cookie, I've heard, is their version of the oreo. There's no way an oreo could ever compare to the Bouchon oreo. We should just replace all oreos with Bouchon ones! They were tres magnifique. Highly recommend stopping by this bakery if you're at The Venetian. You won't regret it.
