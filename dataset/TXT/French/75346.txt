 The cakes are fantastic, and very pretty looking. Most sell for around £2-3, which is what you'd pay for a slice of industrial carrot cake in Costa, so you are getting a good deal. My toffee apple cake was perfect - soft apple slices resting on crispy pastry with toffee flavoured crumble topping. It was also the right size, big enough to give you a decent few bites but not so big that you feel ill afterwards.


 The coffee wasn't as outstanding as some of the cups you can get in Edinburgh, but it was certainly above average. It also came with a free mini madeleine, which was lovely and buttery. Madeleines do not keep well, so you could tell this had been baked very recently.


 They are also the first place I've seen in Edinburgh that sell handmade macarons. The chocolate macaron was very dense, and very chocolately. It wasn't quite as crisp as I would have liked, but this was a minor issue.


 My only real criticism was that service was a bit slow. It wasn't very busy, so I expect you could wait a long time if there were a few customers in.


 Overall, an excellent replacement for the rather unwelcoming Stockbridge Chocolatier, and I shall be back regularly!
