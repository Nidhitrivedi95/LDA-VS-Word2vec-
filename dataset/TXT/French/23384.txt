c8j5MQqlb0RhgS_bpxMDuA Okay, here's the schpiel on Boris Bistro. You go there because they have the nicest patio in Montreal. You're also pleasantly surprised their staff is genuinely friendly and don't hurry up to grab your plates or come ask you "How everything is" too often (sorry, but there is such a thing as overdoing good service). You sit at your table and realise something's different - and amost odd! You can hear yourself think! You can even have a conversation! That's because the Boris Bistro patrons aren't blasting music to distract from their food, cause they don't need to. But, I digress. The reason I really wanted to write this review is to talk to you about their Cold Poblano Pepper Soup. It's soup that could easily be served at a three-star Michelin Restaurant. The flavors are balanced, the spicy peppers don't overpower you - they tease you and perfectly marry the cold wave of pleasure that kicks in shortly afterwards. I gave this restaurant 5 stars because to me, very few restaurants in Montreal can offer this level of ambiance and service and still make great tasting food at a very affordable price. My only critique would be the salmon tartare, which is a bit bland and under seasoned by my standards. Always fresh though! Props on presentation too, I love the black stone plates.
