The dishes that my dining partner and I tried --  coq au vin, French onion soup, charcuterie platter, among others - tasted generally bland, uninspired and generic. Again, I'm basing my opinion on the higher than normal prices that the RR charges. At this price point ($25-$40 for a main) one should expect a level of quality at least close to par with the rest of this city's offerings. 

Now, this restaurant opened a week and a half ago, so I am inclined to say it is still a work in progress, and surely the menu will be revised and refined. Until that point, I would suggest waiting at least a month before you venture in for the food. In the meantime, if you want French - real French - look elsewhere (Didier, Papillon, Le Select Bistro, etc).

PROS: Novel décor, friendly and attentive front staff

CONS: Menu lacks character, refinement, and value; does not stand up to the competition

FINAL WORD: Come here to see and be seen, but not for the food.
