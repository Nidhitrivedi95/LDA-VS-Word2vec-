cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg When I mentioned to all the locals that I was going to Au Pied De Cochon they gave me this really jealous look and demanded to know how I scored a reservation...The trick?  Have a friend call 8 weeks in advance.  It's so worth it.

Great food and fun atmosphere!  I went here with 4 friends and we had a feast!  The duck carpaccio really stole the spotlight, so make sure you order it.  The duck in a can is phenomenal, so is the pied de cochon, don't even think about skipping these two stars.   Leave the lamb alone, it's not their specialty.  Here it's all about the pig.

Two rounds of beer, a bottle of wine, 3 appetizers, 5 entrees, and creme brule cost us about 70 bucks each.  Can you get a better deal?
