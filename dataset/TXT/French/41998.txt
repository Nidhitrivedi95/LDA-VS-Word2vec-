Kut9tVbDX_f7qKMRRoXg3w Went here for lunch... Terrible service... We ordered 2 French onion soup, quiche and ham and cheese crepe... 

We waited for an hour... Only the onion soup came... We were really frustrated... The server was rude and didn't seem to care... Maybe its cause I'm chinese...

The soup was ok... Not great... They used    mozzarella cheese  not Swiss.... The soup cost 18.95... Not worth the price.... Never going back... Will never recommend anyone to come to this restaurant
