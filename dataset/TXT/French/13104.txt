4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Had a wonderful dinner at Mon Ami Gabi last week. We made an early reservation (4:45pm) since we had tickets to a show at 7:30 and didn't want to rush through our meal.

We started with some champagne and the complimentary carrot salad. Then a warm baguette was delivered with some perfectly chilled butter and I knew I was in for a good night.

For an appetizer, we shared a chilled seafood platter that included lobster, oysters, jumbo shrimp and salmon tartare. Perfect. The lobster was "lazy-man"...all ready to eat. Everything was delicious. We ordered french onion soup as it came highly recommended...I'm not a big fan of french onion soup in general...but this was very cheesy and rich. I tasted the broth and we asked why it was so rich...the broth is a combination of beef and veal stock. I don't do veal...so that might be why I wasn't too thrilled with it. But...if you like french onion soup, this might be the one for you. (Note - I don't like the globulous cheese, either...so it's all about personal preference and taste).

For dinner, I ordered the fish special. It was a white fish - similar to a sea bass (but not sea bass; and I can't recall the name of the fish). Cooked perfectly with brussels sports and mashed cauliflower underneath. Absolutely delicious. My companion had the goat cheese salad and loved it.

Service was awesome. Friendly and efficient without being even a touch snooty. Ambiance was fabulous as well.

No room or time for dessert but I would visit Mon Ami Gabi for another meal in a heartbeat.
