YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g This is a review on their wine selection (I have yet to try their food except their French fries which were amazing) 

It is so hard to find my favorite champagne especially for a reasonable price but it isn't just their champagne list that is amazing. They have a great absinthe list and their Bloody Mary bar is to die for!!! Great place to have a few drinks and relax
