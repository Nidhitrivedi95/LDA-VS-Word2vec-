4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Firstly, make a reservation at this place! Do not wait in line for over an hour like the majority of tourists who come to this place.

As for seating, a table on the patio with a great view of the Bellagio is the way to go.

The food is tasty, but the French steaks are too thin for my taste. After one steak, I considered ordering one or two more plates. The fries are also unique and definitely worth a try.

During busy times, it is also apparent that the staff wants you to leave as soon as possible. Oh well, business is business.

I am by no means a regular at this restaurant, but it is definitely wroth a try.
