ysJo5Jdo29XOBCnKrbUKWg I'll admit that I was not hugely impressed with Paris 66 the first couple of times I went there. The crepes were fine (but who wanted to pay so much for crepes when you could get perfectly reasonable ones from Crepes Parisiennes in Shadyside? But, I guess that's no longer an option), brunch was fine, and dinner was fine. I mean, everything was FINE. But nothing was stellar (except for the macaroons. those were out of this world). 

So, I didn't go back for a while. Thankfully I was persuaded to go by some friends, and what a change! I think management is trying really hard to go hard-core French, so the servers all speak French and appear to be legitimate Frenchpersons! The menu has changed and now the dinner entrees are much more traditional French fare. 

When we last went, they unfortunately had run out of everything we wanted to order. And I'm not even exaggerating; I tried to order the duck breast... no go. My husband and another friend tried to order the lamb shank special... no go. They even told us they only had one left, and so my husband and our friend had to decide who would get it, and then they came back to tell us that they actually didn't have ANY left! Despite all this, we really enjoyed the meal and would be happy to go back again. I guess management just has to work on procurement... Excellent desserts, but... wait for it... NO MORE MACAROONS. Gah! This place is too popular for its own good!

So, if you weren't impressed with Paris 66 before, give it another whirl. It's worth the try.
