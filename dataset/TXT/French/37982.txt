Jbl6p9CVkfCB8fWYFd2-Qw Don't be deterred by the suggestively "euro-nightlife" name. I have been to Club Isabella a few times since I moved from Chicago about a year and a half ago, and am consistently impressed with the atmosphere, hospitality, and quality of food and drinks.

As a Case Western graduate student, Club Isabella's location is ideal for after-class happy hour specials that don't include dollar pitchers of Coors light - keeping the wilder campus clientele at an appreciated distance. The interior is gorgeous, the pizzas are delicious and perfect for small plate sharing, and the drinks are phenomenal.

Our bartender Jeff was friendly, funny, and attentive - the perfect mix of professional and personable. $10/drink is reasonable to me considering he used quality liquor, customized each martini to suit our individual tastes, and served each one in a spotless glass that he inspected personally. We had the Elder Wand*, Apple, and Pear martinis. Did I mention that they were phenomenal? I've paid far more for drinks that were far inferior.

Some Yelpers have complained about the parking situation. We valeted out of laziness for $5 but you know what, he opened all of our doors on arrival and departure and had the car ready to drive away before we even walked out to present him with our ticket.

Of course I will be back.
