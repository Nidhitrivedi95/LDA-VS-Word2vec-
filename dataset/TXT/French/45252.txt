mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q Its official, I now qualify to eat at the big boy next door! That will be a later review, now on to this one... 

L'Ateiler is worth the $500+ price tag. Did I just say that? Wow I'm getting snobby, or maybe its not "getting". 

The experience was awesome from beginning to end. I'm going to focus on the highlights of the food but the entire Discovery menu ($175/pp; 9 course) was amazing. 

* Langoustine Carpaccio with toasted poppy seed dressing. 
It was served flat on a dish and to be honest looked a bit odd, but after my first bite I realized this may be the best dish of the night. 

* Poached Baby Kushi Oysters served with French Butter. I'm usually not a big fan of cooked oysters, however the combination of the oyster and our champagne was perfect. 

* Venison with sweet and sour cranberry and chestnuts, served with the house specialty truffle mashed potatoes. Venison is a challenging dish to put on any menu, especially a tasting menu. In this case it was prepared to perfection! The cranberries were not too overpowering and balanced the bold flavor of the venison quite well. 

* Fresh Passion fruit in a coconut meringue. I'm not a big dessert fan, but this was a nice ending after all of those intense flavors. 

The second most impressive thing to me at this restaurant was watching the action in the kitchen. The restaurant is very small, and typically I'm not a big fan of sitting at the bar, however it is a must at L'Atelier. The best way I can describe it is a "ballet with a bell"! Go and enjoy, you will know what I mean.
