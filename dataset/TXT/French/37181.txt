IUtjbbqQ6jUSi4t2jjgYRA Yesss and yes! I was so surprised with the quality of the food. They recently just re-opened and I can't say enough food things about this place. I had the london fog and the quiche. That quiche is perfectly cooked!!

Trust me, not many places can make that and I will def be backing to try out another stuff on the menu. Even their beet carrot soup was excellent.
