4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw An affordable dining experience in Paris, I mean Vegas.  Location was built out perfectly to the French theme.  They had tasty appetizers with the country pate and the garlic simmered shrimp.  The burger was cooked well with a large amount of fries.  The bread that they serve before the meal can be, "cut the top of your mouth hard" so be careful.  A local recommended the french onion soup, but I totally forgot to get that.  Great views if you get the outdoor seating!
