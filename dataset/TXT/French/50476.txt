OYHpqY6-3C-wXR-uPbHhwA I came here from breakfast on a sunday. The food was great. To my surprise they came to our table to refill water and coffee just like a resturant. The service was great. I was so full from my breakfast I wasn't able to try any macaroons. So I went back today and I'm so glad I did. I've macaroons in France, these were the same if not better.There was more filling! Not to mention the woman behind the counter convinced me to buy the butterscotch muffin. I felt like a suckered buying into it until I just took my first bite. It's incredible! After eating it I wanted  make sure to tell everyone about it, so I yelped it. Enjoy!
