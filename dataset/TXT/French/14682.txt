As part of my job as a catering manager my boss asked a few of us to check this place out for lunch to see what sort of competition it was.  A free lunch?  You don't have to ask me twice!

We headed down about 1:30pm on a Wednesday and there were a total for 4 people in the place besides us.  The kitchen is totally open so you can see your food being prepared which I thought was cool but the chefs I was dining with didn't agree.

I ordered the salmon salad in an attempt to be healthy and also because it sounded good.  It came out quickly but lacked all the "stuff" I want in a salad.  On the menu it said roasted peppers, green beans, grilled salmon, blue cheese and lemon vinaigrette.  The salmon seemed like it was from a can, there was one roasted pepper, 2 green beans and 3 chunks of blue cheese.  The vinaigrette was more like lemon scented olive oil and I had to ask for more to coat the salad.  No good.

My coworker ordered the chicken sandwich which looked good and the fries were tasty, someone else ordered the shrimp and grits and they enjoyed it.  The service was good and it smells like a campfire in there but overall I don't know if I'd go again!
