P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ I have now been to three of the Guy Savoys in the world.  The Las Vegas one falls just behind the original one in Paris in my top 5 restaurants I have ever been too.  I loved the bread pairing and the wine pairing with the tasting menu.  If you only go for a couple of courses, you MUST have "Artichoke and Black Truffle Soup,Toasted Mushroom Brioche, and Black Truffle Butter. It is soooo good that I think about this dish all the time.  It is probably the best single dish I have had anywhere. I also love the regular menu item called "Colors of Caviar." Anything langoustine is amazing!  Do not eat much the entire day because you will be consuming a lot of food at this meal.
