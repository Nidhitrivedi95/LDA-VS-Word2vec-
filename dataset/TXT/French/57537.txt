rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I love Bouchon, it is the best place in Las Vegas for breakfast hands down. I make it a point to come for the Ouef and boudin blanc at least once each trip and the pastry is not to be missed. The portions are sufficient but not huge and the service is efficiently understated, just what I need early in the morning.
