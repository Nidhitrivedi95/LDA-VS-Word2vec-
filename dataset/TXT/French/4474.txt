2gUbgbdJ7IFSbicBXlSchw I was a New Yorker in Montreal for my birthday when I came across L'express in a tour book.  It was highly recommended and, even though that's usually a sign for me to run the other way from the tourists, I decided to give it a chance.

I was immediately impressed by the clientele.  Young, old, folks dressed up in furs, people casually wearing jeans, friends, business partners, couples.  I felt that everyone was here because of one thing.  Good food.  We didn't have a reservation and the place was packed.  But I prayed to the Birthday gods and we only had to wait about 10 mins before we had a table.

What we ate:

Cornichons and Bread (free for table)
Ham and Cheese Quiche with Salad
Hanger Steak with herb butter and fries
Quail with Wild Rice 
Creme Caramel a l'orange 

I wish I had ordered the Quiche as my main course, it was so good.  The crust was flaky and on a cold Montreal night, it really hit the spot.  The hanger steak was delicious and way too much I had to share it.  The quail was tender.  The only complaint from my husband was that the wild rice was "Just okay".  By the end of the meal all that was left was a few stray fries.  The creme caramel was velvety and the sauce sweet without being too orangey-bitter.

The service was polite and efficient.  The atmosphere unpretentious bistro style.  The price tag a little high but what the hell.  Happy Birthday to me!
