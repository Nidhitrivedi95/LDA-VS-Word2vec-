yenHHL1QMjj2iAiYu6TRyQ The restaurant is basic Italian food nothing that blows your mind that will have you begging to go back.

It is byow which is most likely the best part.

We had a fun waiter as we were a group of 6 girls :)

The atmosphere is very quiet and calm and all the customers looked upset minus our table.

Calamari is the best thing :)
