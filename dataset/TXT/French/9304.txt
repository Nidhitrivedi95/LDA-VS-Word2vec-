4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw After deciding to punish myself for being exceedingly hungover we walked about a mile to this highly reviewed place looking forward to a late breakfast. We were SOL though at noon on a weekday. Server said it wasn't "fair" to the cooks to have to serve a breakfast menu along with the lunch menu. OK, whatever.

DH ordered a burger medium rare with fruit and I ordered a croque monsieur. Burger was served with fries instead. Got the fruit after bringing to server's attention. Burger came medium and was really dry. My sandwich was horrid. Bread was stale, not crisp and fries were Meh. Only thing really impressed with was the baguette and sangria.

Server was pretty nice though. Sat inside and wasn't crowed at all on a Tuesday. View on the patio is nice and great place to watch the fountains at the Bellagio.

Might try once more for brunch but not holding my breath.
