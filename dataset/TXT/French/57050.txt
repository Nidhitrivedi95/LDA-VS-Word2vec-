rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A It's been quite awhile since I came here, but I was motivated to go to Bouchon to try Thomas Keller's fried chicken from his restaurant Ad Hoc on 4th of July, as his recipe is supposed to be incredible.

Being the chicken lover that I am, I hurried over, and yes it was the best fried chicken I have ever had.  However, it was the most expensive at $36.  But it was a really huge amount of food.  A half of a chicken, mac and cheese, collard greens, and a bacon biscuit.  And some really delicious homemade cracker jacks were given to us on the way out.

The entire experience, from the food to the service was pretty awesome.  So I think I like Bouchon more than I did before.  I'm motivated from this visit alone to come back, at least for brunch.
