E9HkUYYO_-5vKjvBwLuDIw Once again Oh La La delivers gourmet dining but at a reasonable price. A must have is the Endive salad.   The texture and taste is perfect. The lamb chops were prepared perfectly with yummy accompanied dipping sauce. The tiramisu melts in your mouth and the serving size could be for two   The owner is also the executive chef and the staff is friendly and efficient. The owner visits your table to make sure you are satisfied. Each plate is cooked to order. They have a nice selection of wine. I highly recommend Oh La La if you want a nice evening with great food.
