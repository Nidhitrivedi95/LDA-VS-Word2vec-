My husband and I went there for the first time on a Friday night to use a groupon.  Definitely recommend reservations, because we didn't have them and almost didn't get in. Fortunately a dust storm scared people off the patio, but cleared out when we got there, so the patio was wide open.

Food was amazing!!!  From our triple onion tarte appetizer, to the filet mignon and lamb shank, to the chocolate pecan tarte for dessert. We left totally satisfied, but wanting more.

It is a little pricey, $88 (before groupon discount) for 1 appetizer, 2 entrees, and 1 dessert and coffee, but totally worth it.  We will definitely be back and recommend to everyone we know. Ambiance is great, loved the patio seating (so ask for courtyard if weather is good) service was excellent, and the flavors and food were perfect. A must try if you like french food. Looked like 2 fifties era houses that had been converted into restaurants, so the atmosphere was cozy but intimate.
