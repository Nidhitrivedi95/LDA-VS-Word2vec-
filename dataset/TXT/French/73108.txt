xNnZ5ksBY1gwwTV2Btb4Ag Went here for dinner last night, and it lived up to expectations. 

Had the beet/onion salad cold dish starter, which was light, fresh, and perfect for summer. Main course was rabbit leg / whole cauliflower / cauliflower purée / greens - meat was perfectly done, and the cauliflower was surprisingly tasty, which was different since I usually associate cauliflower with the overcooked soggy stuff you usually find in the 'mixed vegetable' tray at cafeterias. This was the opposite. Finished with a ridiculouslyyyy good cheese plate that came with puréed strawberries. Even the starter bread at this place was excellent (three kinds in the basket: raisin, sesame, white). 

While the food and wine (great selection!) were excellent, it was the service that really stood out in a class of its own. I felt like we had 4-5 personal servers, but not in a "I'm just covering for your regular server while he's out for a smoke break" kind of way. More of a "we're all here as an incredibly attentive team, and are totally on the ball" kind of way. And all this without being in your face or pushy. 

Maybe the decor could be a bit more interesting? Other than that, not much to say about this place that isn't positive. I would recommend it, especially for a nice dinner with a small group of friends.
