Overall experience: 9/10

My friend took me to Colette for a birthday "brunch". It is a fantastic place to go when you are celebrating an occasion. The entire place is beautiful and feels worthy enough to deem unique for your celebration. 

The reason there is no service rating is because there was no wait staff when we were there. We ordered pastries and coffee from the bakery, and it was brought to us, but that was the extent of the service. That being said, those who did take our orders were pleasant and helpful. 

What we ate was good. Nothing really stands out, and I can not speak for their lunch/dinner food. However, Colette gets a high rating due to their design. Sitting in a grand, Parisian-inspired room really does influence your experience, even if the food was just normal. 

The bottom line: though the food is normal, you may come just for the decor (and the instagrams), and that's okay.
