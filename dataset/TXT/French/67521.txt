The first thing you'll notice about Cluny is the beautiful decor and "grand" atmosphere. You'll feel like you've travelled to Paris the moment you step in. another thing you'll notice is the large BREAD TABLE in the centre of the dining area. To me, this was the highlight of my experience, the bread, which doesn't really justify the restaurant's soaring prices.

In terms of service, most of the servers were, like the food, bland, with great presentation. At times, it felt like I was speaking to a beautifully decorated wall that would occasionally smile back at me. Overall, it was kind of an awkward experience. 

Now, the main event, or honestly lack thereof, the food! My family and I ordered a variety of dishes, as it was my mother's birthday. 

We started off with the Snap Pea/ French Bean Salad which was SUPER SMALL and OVERPRICED. We then had the Tuna Tartar which was standard and probably the best dish of the night. For main courses we had the Veal Meatball, which tasted bland, and dry, although the added bone was cute. The char boiled octopus lacked seasoning, it was literally boiled octopus that had been slapped on the grill for a minute or two. Then we had the grilled fish, which again, was bland, we covered it in salt and pepper. Also, all the dishes as a whole were "overly complex" and now in a good way. Many of the accompanying sauces were either too tart, too vinegary, or too bitter to really compliment the food. This is description is applicable to the side veggies as well.

Overall, come here only ONCE and do it just for the bread and atmosphere.
