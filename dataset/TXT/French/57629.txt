rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A This place is amazing; great way to try Thomas Keller's stuff at a great price point. The food is quite good; really like the appetizers (try the smoked salmon in clarified butter terrine) and the entrees are also solid. Service is really distinctive; last time I was here, they were about 30 minutes late in seating us, but made up for it with a bottle of wine and free appetizers. The fact that they were willing to do so much (knowing they'd probably not see us for a year as they're in Vegas) goes to show the level of professionalism and commitment to good service. Definitely coming back each time I'm in Vegas.
