A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g The cakes here are super delicious! I would have given this place a 5 star however I came across problems. I came to this place twice for the panache(?) but each time it didn't have it. So the last time I came I figured I'm here anyways so I might as well try a few new things. So anyways , on this last visit this is what I found....

1- if you order the macaroons, do not eat it right away. as soon as I got in my car I took a bite out of one and it tasted like "refrigerator". I'm guessing from it being too close from the vent in the showcase of the store. When I ate it about 24 hrs later, the refrigerator taste was gone. Which made it ok.  
2- the girls in the bakery are friendly however the girl with the dreads made a comment to me to buy her one aswell (I'm assuming because I spent $60 on this one transaction) .. girl, your making this customer feel uncomfortable. You work here so go feed yourself a slice of cake on ur break. Whether it be a joke or not, you have a job , go buy your own... 
3- the girl with the green hair.. I saw her put on gloves to pick up the fallen macaroons in the display showcase. She took off the gloves and I guess missed one macaroon so I guess she was lazy to put a new pair on and I saw her grab it with her bare hands and place it back on top of the other macaroons in the showcase. Kind of nasty.

Cleanliness are this bakery isn't so great and the customer service is a little too friendly? I guess u can say. The cakes here are super delicious and regardless of me seeing an employee touching the food with their bare hands, maybe I'll come back again? Not so sure. But hopefully management reads this and betters their associates.
