gxMa7j1LXIUxxBoP0osDpA Definitely the best and most delicious food to find in the Gay Village. It's tucked away at a parallel street from Ste. Catherine, and the menu appears to change everyday. The food simply put, blew my mind. Something drew me to the Tempura Blood Pudding, something I would traditionally never order, but no regrets whatsoever - it was one of the most delicious appetizers I've ever tasted. Perfectly mixed with vegetables and a complementing aioli, it was perfection embodied in an appetizer. The codfish was every bit as joyous, perfectly crispy skin and soft and buttery meat in a delectable olive oil sauce. Wish we had more space for dinner. It's byob so come prepared - for us it was a nice 'recovery period' from the afternoon spent drinking in the village!
