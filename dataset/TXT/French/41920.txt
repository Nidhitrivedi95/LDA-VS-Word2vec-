Kut9tVbDX_f7qKMRRoXg3w This quaint little Marche has a that feel of a little Paris. Random objects clutter the walls (wooden shoes, old photos, chalkboards with different eats available, etc). And faux ham and sausage links hang in the window. There is a full deli, but I went for breakfast. Saw it just walking by and popped in. Everyone was quite nice and very cheerful. We got the fruit crepes with chocolate. Very tasty. I also like that coffee was given in a mug. I drink quite a lot of it. Not the best coffee, but definitely what I needed at the time.
Overall, a very pleasant experience.
