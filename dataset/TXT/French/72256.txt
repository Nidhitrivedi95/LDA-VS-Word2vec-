XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q Ate here a couple of years ago but unlike e by Jose andres it's a little bit harder for me to recall anything truly spectacular about the experience.  The food was good but not that memorable.  I remember the candy cart being very awesome but can't recall specifically any one dish that stood out.
The atmosphere was very serious and formal which didn't really contribute to my enjoyment of the food that much.  I remember all around us people speaking to each other in low hushed tones as if we were in an art museum rather than a restaurant.  I feel that being in a setting where you must treat your meal with such reverence detracts from the food somehow; additionally service was coldly polite so that didn't help things.
If you must, don't do the full menu, there were a lot of extras on the menu and its easy to get full before even the meat courses start.
