dubu2kN3Y9EB4uYGFWa0MQ This restaurant is in the Monte Carlo soon to be MGM Park.  Enjoyed the breakfast and went back for dinner too! Food is fresh! Loved the freshly made donuts for dessert!  What was a delight was the folks they are so friendly and sevice top notch. Went for drinks @ the bar a 3rd visit. So well staffed that  there was a lot of one on one service. Loved talking with Joe, Stephen, Tim, Jeff and others across the bar. Yes the Bar Staff is great. Oh try their milled warm wines for the holiday season! This experience made my stay @ the hotel.
