rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Bouchon is my Sunday Brunch spot! Be sure to check out the specials, at times they are real winners. 

We came a bit late (around 1215). At this point, they were sold out of the Terrine Foie Gras and Charcuturie. Instead we got a basket of their delicious fresh-baked pastries and beignets. Next time, I'll probably skip the pastries but the beignets are so light, fluffy, and perfectly cinnamon-sugary I'll have to try those again!

They're famous for they're chicken & waffles--gourmet of course. And they're absolutely delectable. You'll be licking your plate clean (if that sort of thing was appropriate here, of course). The entree I had was the Corn Beef Hash. The one thing that I'm very nit-picky on is overly salty food. This hash was just right! They cooked my eggs exactly how I specified and all the delicious flavors came right through.

TIP: Show up early enough to get the good Hors d'oeuvres!
