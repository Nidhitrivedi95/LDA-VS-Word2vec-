rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Dinner our first night in town at the hotel.  A great meal with a great waiter Gary and his helper Jose'.  Order anything and it will be all good.  I'm not kidding.  Only two negatives -
1) I've had better French onion soup.  Actually the DB Brasserie downstairs on the casino level had very good and savory French onion soup.  It was a bit too sweet here.
2) Service grinded to a halt when entrees and then our dessert were supposed to be coming out.  Almost a 25 minute window from the previous course.  Did all the cooks take a break at the same time?  I don't know, but after a long horrible night of trying to check into the Venetian (not a great hotel at all by the way) we just wanted to get done.

Really nice people that weren't pretentious at all running the place.  Good food and good people.
