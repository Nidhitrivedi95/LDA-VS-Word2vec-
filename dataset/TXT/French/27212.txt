dd3GZs6zW2t7BM0cbxAzvg I had brunch here on a sunday.

I started with the fried camembert, which was great.  The exterior was crunchy, the inside ranged from liquid to gooey.  The berry coulis was neither too sweet nor too sour, and complemented the camembert very nicely.  Despite the fat content, overall it didn't feel too "heavy."

Next I had a boar crepinette, which was a little dry, but only slightly so.  It came with a fried egg, and when I ate them together it was just fine.  The green beans on the side were nice and crisp.

The duck confit omlette was satisfactory, but nothing special.  The duck was mostly lost in the omlette, neither the texture nor the flavor were sufficiently prominent.

For dessert, I had the trio of creme brulees.  
The vanilla was a well-executed classic, with a rich full-bodied flavor.
I was quite happy with the lime (I'm generally a fan of lime) which had sweet and sour flavors well balanced.
The chocolate-chili (which they warned me was still in an experimental stage) was okay, but I had to use my imagination a bit to taste the chili.

The service was prompt, accurate, and friendly.

While some of the food was not awesome, I decided to award 4 stars on the strength of the fried camembert and the creme brulees, and also on account of the great service.
