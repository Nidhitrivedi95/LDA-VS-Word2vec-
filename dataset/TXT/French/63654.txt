When you are seated the only menu available is the Prix fix and no pricing is provided. After inquiring, the cost is $55. When we asked for the a-la-cart menu, which we asked about before placing our reservation, and compared pricing, that's where things got interesting. If you were to add the most expensive items from all 3 courses it would still not equal to $55. The pricing on their Web site vs their a-la-cart menu vs their dessert menu have varying prices for the same item. 
The food was good, but not for this price point. I understand that you are paying a premium for the show, but the deceptive and misleading structure to their menus should be addressed.
