SBnpT6JDbah-5l_52GM5sw Aah Sardine, I want to like you so much, but the food is ultimately mediocre.  Too salty and buttery, even for French food.

Appetizers:
Moules frites: pretty good!  Too many fries though.
Charcuterie plate: not super great, and looked kind of unorthodox (lettuce?). Mousse was hard to spread, not enough pickled vegetables, and selection of meats seemed limited.

Main courses: (super large portions)
Poussin (aka young chicken): tender and tasty! Potatoes were caramelized. Watercress was a bit acidic and bitter, but together the dish was well balanced.
Duck confit salad: very disappointing.  Too salty and acidic overall.  Duck was tough and chewy.  Poached egg had no flavor and was watery on the inside.  Would absolutely NOT recommend.

Ambiance is very hip and chill for both couples and groups, with tables against the front for lake views during the day.  
Service was a bit slow, but our waitress was absolutely lovely.  

Sadly, everything was great except for the food.
