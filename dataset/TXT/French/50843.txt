oZHbPhIj01_31jqD053a_Q I had the tasting menu at Europea in its early years, and I have great memories of it. But Europea is now playing a defending game where nothing changes, and what I had seen as genius and new, now appears as gimmicks and old cheap tricks. If you have been once, you will not need to come back. Great quality, you should go - but it is very disappointing that nothing ever changes. It is time for Jerome Ferrer to rethink his menu and get inspired by more contemporary ideas. His menu and gimmicks now feel a little bit dated. If you are from Montreal and you think this is the pinnacle of food, you need to get out of the city and travel to New York or Tokyo - or at least Google what today's top chefs are doing. Europea is the kind of restaurant that desperately would hope to get one Michelin star, but would lose all of its personality trying to get there by focusing on dated and gimmicky presentation instead of inspired flavors.
