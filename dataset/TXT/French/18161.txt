A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g This is only for the Macaroons : Hubby and I got an assortment of Salted Caramel, Pistachios, Vanilla, Peanut Butter, Coffee, Ginger (o.O) and Rose.  I must say they are definitely one of the best we have had :)  Like many reviewers had already commented, they are "smaller" in size but makes it back in taste!  The rose was very unique but I really like it, it's has a light floral taste without feeling I'm actually eating a rose.  
Only suggestion I have is a better 'box' to carry these in.  Right now, it's just being tossed into a box which is fine for winter, but in the 'warmer temp' - all the macaroons fillings were melting by the time we got home :(
