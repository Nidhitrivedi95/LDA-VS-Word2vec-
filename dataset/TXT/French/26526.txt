D87tFO-R6U8f4-e0r4Zq_g I've always been more of a savory crepe person, than a sweet person. As they say, I'm sweet enough as it is. I've tried both the St. Tropez and Cote D' Azur, and I truly loved them, both, and as many have recommended, I also prefer folded crepes over rolled cold ones. 

Service here is right on the mark, and as soon as you enter you're greeted right away. (Of course it helps that there are just a couple of tables). Everything is prompt and pleasant. 

This is definitely one of the better crepe digs in Toronto. Will be back!
