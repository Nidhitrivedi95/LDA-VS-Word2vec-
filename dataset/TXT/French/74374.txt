xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g A short review:
Pros:
great view
got to see the kitchen as we entered the restaurant.
Good bread..
a very extensive wine list

Cons:
Mediocre food.
Service wasn't what I expected for an 'expensive' restaurant - not to say the service sucked, they were just absent a lot.
did i mention expensive? for a-okay food?

I docked one star for the mean lady who took my reservation as we were walking through the paris hotel. It was during the day so of course I wouldn't be all dressed up, ready to go and eat.. This lady said, "Oh, shorts arent allowed" -_- I think we know. Please don't treat us like kids just because we look younger than 21yearolds.

Just plain Rude. With a capital R.
