YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g This place is great! I got their house burger with Gruyere cheese, mushrooms, avocado and the chili aioli. It was fabulous. The only thing I didn't like was that the fries were plain. good, but plain. I would have expected more from a gourmet spot but I understand why the plate was constructed the way it was. The meal was a little pricier but it's good quality food and very well put together meal. Highly recommend this spot and this meal.
