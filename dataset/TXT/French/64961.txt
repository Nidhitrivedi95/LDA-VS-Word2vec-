Tl2nqtPXlLbAG3qkUYVM2g Such a charming place, but blink and you'll drive right past it. The menu changes daily I think, so you'll always get something new with each visit.

The croissants are to die for! They also have a crème brulee sampler that includes vanilla bean, passion fruit, mocha, Grand Marnier and chocolate. Awesome. Loved every bite.
