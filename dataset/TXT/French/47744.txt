O3OH5IEFMPtz7mPKakPZ3Q Kevin is awesome. He was friendly and he has created an amazing menu. The food was great with fresh ingredients, you can taste the quality! The prices were reasonable. The restaurant is small but if there is a wait, it's worth it. 
We had Gyoza, Rock Shrimp, Truffle Oil Edamame, Fried Rice and Tacos (Salmon and Beef).... I would order everything ok. It was all delicious.
Also... the coconut sake was amazing!!!
We will be back.
