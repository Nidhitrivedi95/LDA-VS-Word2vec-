qmh6zxtJ8C8-YiUPv7ySlw I've had great experiences both times coming here.  The first time I had the 3 prefix menu and the fish entree was amazing.  So amazing that I can still remember what it tastes like a year later.  This time I ordered the mussels, which was really good.  The mussels were cooked in a broth that kept the mussels moist.

Service is always great here, attentive but not pushy.  Always get seated outside if possible.  How can you complain eating next to a waterfall and lake.  At certain times of the night, there's a water show.  It's not amazing, but it's something different.
