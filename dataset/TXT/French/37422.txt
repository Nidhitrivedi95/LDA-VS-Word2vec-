j0baDQfMAGDm_QGdFMmb-Q Not quite as happy as some of the other reviewers here but I will be back.  Service was a bit slow, took quite a while to get our drink orders.  The bread and dip is fabulous and tempting to fill up on it.  I thought the salmon tartar was fairly dull, it was labeled "spicy" but it wasn't.  My shrimp dish was ver flavorfull but the shrimp were overcooked and tough.  My spouse liked his duck dish a lot. Other diners liked the eggplant tart and anchovy pastry a lot as well.  The beet salad was sort of ordinary as were the fries.  All in all though, there were a lot of interesting menu selections and we'll try it again in the near future.  I was sorry to see Dragonfly go but really glad this is here.  I really like to support small restaurants with local owners vs chains.

Update:  Went back yesterday a litle after 7:30 and was told they were out of bread and dip!  How can you run out of bread?  It is like running out of water, sort of.....
So we left.  Went to Marco's instead.
