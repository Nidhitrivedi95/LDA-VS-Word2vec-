sphMzEIqY1I2Dzv3zLZY2g Have been to Global 4 to 5 times now and it is consistently good. Very unassuming location (in an office park off of Johnson Rd. on 485) but they make the best of it. Great service that seems like side jobs for local Johnson & Wales kids (who else would be able to describe the cooking method for each entree that descriptively? Maybe... I don't know). Chef covers many different cuisines, hence the name, but seems to do best with creations of his own (try the pork belly if it is ever on the menu). Worth the trip. Decent to above average wine list.
