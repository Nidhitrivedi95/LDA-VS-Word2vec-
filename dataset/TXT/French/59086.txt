rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w We had a wonderful experience at Le Cirque tonight. Delicious food, attentive service all- around, and our server - Martin- was so professional. They have a few menus you can choose from. We went with the safe middle option - 5 courses, which was just the right amount of food. They also have a 10 course option, which in our experience of multi-course tasting menus means - roll us out the door. There was also an additional starter and dessert not on the menu, as well a mini plate of fruit gelees, macarons, and a delicious little pink thing which may or may not have been a marshmallow to finish. A smoked salmon with panna cotta, caviar, and gold leaf on top - and a watermelon granita with lime foam as a refreshing palate cleanser. I absolutely loved the chestnut veloute - the flavors were so intriguing. If he could, I'm sure SO would have licked some of his plates clean. We came purely for the chocolate ball, and it was a great visual experience. All in all, we were very happy and have been inspired to return home and try Le Cirque in New York. Hopefully it will live up to the experience we've had in Vegas.
