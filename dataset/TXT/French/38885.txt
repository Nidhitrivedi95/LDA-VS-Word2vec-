jLxeBgWhLRbII2ACkgH1Sg This is my second visit here and wow - always impressed with the quality of their food. I think the chicken quiche I ordered was probably the best I have ever ate. I really enjoyed the extra crunch crust of the quiche as well as the cheese. It came with rosemary potatoes and a small salad. Great place to stop if you are in the area.
