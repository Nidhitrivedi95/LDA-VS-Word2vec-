4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Wife and i came here for dinner.  This is our second time here.  We both shared the peppercorn steak and the filet minion merlot.  Both medium rare.  It was EXCELLENT!!  Both plates were served with lightly salted crispy flat stringy fries, very good.  We also ordered the French onion soup,  highly recommend!   Our drink for the evening was a large decanter of sangria.  Oh man, that was tasty!   This place will be a regular stop now when in Vegas!  Cheers!!!!!
