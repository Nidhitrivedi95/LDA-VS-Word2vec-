gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg On a trip to Montreal, we stumbled upon this restaurant just in need of something quick and nearby. The menu looked interesting and affordable. It's a large restaurant, with outdoor seating and the restaurant itself is pretty open. I ordered the pork shank house speciality, which only ran about $15 so I thought it would be a good portion. It was humungous! Two large pork shanks, both fatty and tender, along with veggie sides (basically just a big piece of broccoli) and fries that I substituted for sweet potato fries. A bit too satisfied, I couldn't finish it all...

Everyone else's dishes looked really tasty, from chicken burgers to the steak. We also shared the appetizer Flammekeuches? which is kind of like a really thin/flat pizza. With bacon, gruyere cheese and onions, it was a nice light snack but only had about 1.5 small pieces each for 10 people.

Overall enjoyable! And they offered to do separate checks, which was convenient.
