zw4Legbcu018p5WcZ74iWA I came here with a friend while we were visiting Montreal for the first time. Neither of us speak French but the staff was very helpful and patient with us! The food was also very very good! My friend ordered the poutine and she said it was the best she's ever had. I had a burger and it was excellent, not too big. Overall, it is a great little place and they were very friendly!
