IvFdi-vp823dTAWwHMT6xQ So when you book a room here, it comes with free breakfast. The FREE breakfast includes.., CEREAL, TOAST, FRUITS ... And that's all. 

If you want a hot breakfast, aka 2 eggs, fries (home fries?), and either bacon, ham or sausages for $4 per person. 

Okay yea I know it's free and all for the cold toast and fruits but still... I would expect more from a hotel breakfast. 

Ps it's crazy empty inside. No shitz, I mean who would want this??
