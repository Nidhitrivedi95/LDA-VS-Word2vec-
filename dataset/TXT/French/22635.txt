On not-so-good days, it's watered down and not blended well. Recommended dishes: red velvet waffle, Terrace French toast, bacon or pecan waffle. The s'more waffle is too sweet for a meal, it works well as a dessert, though. The service has always been good even when they're slammed. If you're planning to go Sunday for brunch, plan to wait for a table due to this place's popularity, but it's worth it of you plan for it.  They will not seat you until your entire party is present.
