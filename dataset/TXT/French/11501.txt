4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I stopped in with a friend to sit on the patio and have a light meal yesterday. We were seated outside after a short wait and brought bread and shredded carrot salad. We each had the French onion soup and  petite salad. Both were lovely. The salad was light and crisp. The greens were fresh and perfect. The soup was heavy with cheese and served the perfect temperature. The flavor was not overwhelming and tasted freshly made as well. 

The service was just the right amount of attentive without being fawning. It was supposed to be just a "quick stop" nothing special grab a bite meal and it has been my best, albeit small, dining experience in Vegas so far.
