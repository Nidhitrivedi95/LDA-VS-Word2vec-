Although a native, this place opened just before I left for LA so I didn't get a chance to eat here often but I do go whenever I am back in town. Anyone who knows Montreal knows that it is definitely a foodie town...Montreal palates have been spoiled so that many restaurants in other cities which may satisfy pedestrian tastes, do nothing for a more practiced tongue. This modern Italian restaurant (with French flourishes) uses the freshest ingredients and constantly modifies their menu as it is connected with a culinary institute...the students come here to practice how to run a real restaurant. I'm salivating just thinking about this place...hmm...time to book a ticket back home.

*Don't forget to bring your own wine or if you forget, there is an SAQ (government liquor store) right next door. They do not serve alcohol...i don't believe they are licensed for that.
