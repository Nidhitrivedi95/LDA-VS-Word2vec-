xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g Eiffel Tower Restaurant would be the epitome of fine dining.  I would recommend making reservations as it can be busy during weekends.  Also, do remember to dress up for this dining occasion.  I've been here twice, and literally every table in the restaurant has a view of Bellagio's water show.  At night, the strip lights really come alive, and you can take it all in while enjoying a bottle of Grgich Hills cabernet sauv.  This is a great place for a romantic dinner, or a friendly get together.  They definitely have enough waitstaff to accomodate both.  The bartender is friendly, so if you have to wait for a table don't hesistate to grab a cocltail. 

I had the roasted lamb rack with a side of asparagus.  The lamb was cooked to a perfect medium rare, a deep purple in the center.  It was crusted in pepper and served with some grilled tomatoes.  The lamb had the consitency of cotten candy and melted in my mouth.  The asparagus was cooked perfectly in butter and topped with parmesan cheese bits.  The asparagus rivaled my entree in quality.  I also had the opportunity to try the filet mignon, as well as the veal medallions, and both met or exceeded my standards.  We finished with a choclate souffle, which I must wholeheartedly recommend.  

The service exceeded my expectations.  My drinks never dipped below the halfway point.  There was perhaps one waiter for every person in our party.  Our waiter was friendly, funny, and knowledgeable on every item on the menu.  Overall, a great experience.

Although the dinner is very costly, I must recommend it if you love fine dining.  

PROTIP:  You must order the souffle at the beginning of the meal because it takes a while for them to prepare it, so let your waiter know.
