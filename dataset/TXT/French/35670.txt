htQgj-ANQpZGpIpkkrEmyQ On the north end of Main Street Markham, Inspire is a cozy place in Markham. They have a lot of parking spaces located on the right side of the shop. Walking into the store, I felt like it was well designed, with a fusion of asian and caucasian feel - the fireplace and the touch of wood really made it. 

The waiters/waitresses are all very nice and patient, kindly explaining what was on their menu for those who have never came before. Their chicken waffles were great the first time with fresh meringues, pomegranate seeds and fennel seeds. However, the second time, the waffle was a bit smaller, had melted meringues and tomatoes were used to replace the pomegranate seeds and the appearance did not match up to the first time I went. Their other foods are still great, their INSP burger being a fulfilling specialty.

I really want to come back and try their creme brulee dessert - if they still offer it.
