4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw We ate here for breakfast and we loved it so much, we had to go back!  Everything was amazing and waitstaff was super friendly and helpful.  I don't understand the bad reviews at all!  Baguette with nutella was delicious, special benedict was delicious, and french toast with blueberry compote was amazing.
