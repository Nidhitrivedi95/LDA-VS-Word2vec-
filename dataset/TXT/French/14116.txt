58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw I had a great Sunday breakfast/brunch here. I ate the Brunch des Cantons which is eggs, country ham, bacon, sausage, baked beans and potatoes served in a cast iron skillet. It was definitely hearty but exactly what I needed after a late night and every component of the dish tasted awesome. Turns out it was the only meal I needed for the entire day.
