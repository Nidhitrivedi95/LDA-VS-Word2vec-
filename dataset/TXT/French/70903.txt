xBxDMEkFK5GBhiy-8gGE9w The food was pretty good, but the experience was mostly ruined by the abysmal service (I should have trusted the many reviews that repeatedly complained about the service!)

We were met by the smileless maitre'd. We asked the waiter for some advice, but he mostly read the menu aloud (we could do this ourselves, thank you very much). I ordered a cocktail, and some foreign body was floating in the glass. OK things happen, so I asked the waiter to replace it. At this price range of the restaurant, I'd expect him to smile apologetically and replace it without any fuss. Well, not here at Brasserie-T. He started to argue that this obviously foreign body is part of the green leaf, which was floating in the cocktail. I asked him to replace it anyway.

Then the most hilarious part comes. The waiter took the glass away, and my wife observed him removing this foreign thing with his hand (sic!). Then he brings it back, and ... starts to argue again. Now he says it fell into my cocktail from the tree while he was bringing it. Well, we were indeed sitting under a tree, but I don't really care if it's from a tree, or a bird, or anything else - this junk clearly didn't belong in my cocktail. I asked him to just bring me a new glass. Amazingly, unbelievably he continue to argue. At this point I just got sick and tired of it, and just refused the cocktail.

Again the food was decent, but the overall experience was pretty poor.  There are lots of great restaurants in Montreal. Just look elsewhere.

Update: later that day we had dinner at Bouillon Bilk, and the difference was night and day, as the latter was absolutely amazing.
