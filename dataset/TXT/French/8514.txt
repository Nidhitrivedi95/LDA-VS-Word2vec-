4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I've gone here so many times! It's a wonderful place to spend your birthday, anniversary, or just a romantic night out. I once heard that the darker the lighting is at a restaurant the more expensive it is. That's not the case with this place. It's actually a really good deal, considering being on the Strip. You can sit out on the strip itself, watch tourists or sit inside with the look of the beautiful restaurant. Very classy. Love this place!
