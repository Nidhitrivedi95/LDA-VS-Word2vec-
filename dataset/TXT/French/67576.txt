Anyway, we sat at the bar to see the chef cracking up oysters. However, we weren't necessarily eating oysters. I ordered a dish of ceviche and tartare for appetizer. The food surprisingly came very fast. So speed is definitely a plus in this restaurant. 

For main,I ordered lamb. The lamb was overcooked but thankfully the server was willing to change the food. That is another plus.

All in all, the place is good. No need to wait for too long, food is fast. Only problem is price  if you don't mind paying the price, definitely worth the visit.
