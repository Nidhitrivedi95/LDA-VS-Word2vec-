rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Service - 5 stars! We came here this past weekend for a friends birthday. We were a party of 11 - came in around 1pm on a Saturday and left at 330pm, but only ended up waiting around 20 minutes without reservation for brunch. 

Food - I shared a chocolate croissant with a friend as appetizer (with side of grapefruit juice), and got the Croque Madame (which was absolutely amazing with the sunny side up eggs!). I'm already a huge fan of french fries as well, but these were extra delicious! My friend ordered the chicken & waffles - VERY heavy for a brunch (especially if you're feeling a little hung over given the gravy and other sauces), but otherwise super savory!

We also ordered the dessert platter (ordered 6 of the 7 desserts) they had on the menu. My two favorites were the bonbon (ice cream cream puff-like) and the creme brulee!!!! My least favorite were the the flan (it was kind of bland in my opinion) and the custard cake (also very nothing atypical).

Again - service was SUPERB. I would definitely come back here on my next Vegas trip!
