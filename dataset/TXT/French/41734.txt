However, upon entering the room, it was filled with the stench of mold, floors were wet, and decor looked like it hadn't been touched up in 10 years. Not even was the envelope inside the welcome book clean. Everything looked as though it's been stepped on and clearly marked from other usage. 
Service was barely helpful so we checked out, canceling the remainder of the stay and booked another hotel room.

The rest of our weekend will be spent coughing up phlegm and downing antihistamines to avoid getting properly sick from our allergies to the mold.
