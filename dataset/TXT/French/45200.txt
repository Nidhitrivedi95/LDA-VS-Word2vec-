It was hard to make the reservations online, probably because it was on a busy weekend. But if you call the front desk at the MGM, they will probably find you a better time slot. When I showed up, only 2/3 of the space was occupied. Our waiter sat us at the counter, where you can see the entire kitchen staff working on the food. All the food decorations are fake besides the tomatoes!

Below is a list of items we ordered:

Appetizers:
LE FOIE GRAS - Traditionally Poached Chilled Duck Foie Gras
LE VITELLO - Thin Chilled Slices Of Veal Topped With Tuna Sauce & Sweet Gem Lettuce
LA DAURADE - Snapper Marinated With Lime, Tomato & Virgin Olive Oil

Main Course:
LE BŒUF - Wagyu Beef Rib Eye
L'ONGLET - Steak Tartar With Old-Fashioned French Fries
Pommes Purée - Mashed Potatoes

Foie gras was a bit oily for my taste, but I guess I have to get use to it. I did not enjoy the veal one bit. What I did take pleasure in was the snapper. It was very colorful and the flavor just explodes in your mouth. The rib eye was ok; it was not as tender as I would prefer. Plus I find it a bit pricey ($99) finding out the meat was domestic. The tartar had too taste of onions. My wife really loves their French fries and bread. Their famous mashed potatoes did not disappoint, very buttery, but only in small portions.

Overall the food did not wow me. Maybe next time I will try their Prix Fixe menu. During the meal my waiter seemed way too busy. Don't get me wrong, he was not rude or anything. But later the waiter found out my wife did not like the steak tartar, so he took it off of the bill (very nice of him). Bill came out a little over $300 (still tipped over 20%). I think next time I am going to try their flagship next door, Joël Robuchon. Remind me to break my piggy bank before I go there.

Whoever says first time experience is always the best is mistaken!
