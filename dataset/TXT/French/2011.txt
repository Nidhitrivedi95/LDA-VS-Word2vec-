This is as close to an authentic french food as you can get, I love the quiches, they are so fluffy, airy and delicious, the pastries are outstanding, made with lots of butter (as they should) and really everything is good here.
The only drawback i have is the average coffee and the very tight space.
If you like french pastries this is for you (just bring coffee from mcdonalds next door)
