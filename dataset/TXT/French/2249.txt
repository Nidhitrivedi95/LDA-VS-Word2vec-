0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g One of the most audaciously over priced and least interesting meals I have ever had. And I have dined on six continents.The kitchen is simply "mailing it in". The carrots were mealy, the red wine reduction sauce had no salt in it whatsoever, Nor did the asparagus. The tuna tartare was tasteless. Ditto for the breads. The venison was bland and had no taste. The pigeon was OK. This is simply a disgraceful performance for what pretends to be one of the best restaurants in the US if not the world. It is clear that the kitchen and the chef, who is extremely talented, has no interest in the quality of food that is being served and can take the diners in, since most patrons have no sense of food, and therefore, areeasily taken advantage of.
