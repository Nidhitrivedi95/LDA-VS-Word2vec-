O66Zy8Y13VBm72ZDhS4fIg For some reason, i always remembered this restaurant as a fond memory back in 2001.  One of the best restaurants I've been to date, and I've been to many all over the world on expense accounts and out of my own pocket.  I even remember I paid about $70-80 for the dinner by myself on a weekday.  Was in Toronto on a business trip.  Service and food was the best, ambiance top notch.  Some celebs go here every now and then.  Some pro bball player was treating his entire extended family out to here the day I was there.  I just remember everything so nice and vividly still.  Beautiful hostesses here too.  But I was young, so maybe I was impressed more easily.  This place also turns into a nightclub late at night on weekends.
