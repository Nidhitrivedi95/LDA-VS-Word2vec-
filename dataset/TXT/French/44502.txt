MhFoFpLBx_Fy8gs9dlwtGA THIS PLACE IS SOLID! 

The food is SERIOUSLY good. The staff are very professional as well. The moment I walked in I knew this place was going to be good (not touristy, mostly locals who look like they know what's up, or tourists who know what's up, any way overall good vibe.) Au Petit Extra met and went beyond my expectations. Dare I say, my dinner companions were impressed with my killer food instinct to have chosen this place. 

I would love to go back there.
