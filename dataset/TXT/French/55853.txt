rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I would give my first Thomas Keller restaurant 3.5 stars.  We showed up a little after 5pm with no reservation and the restaurant was nearly empty.  And even after dining for almost 2 hours, the restaurant was still pretty empty for a Saturday night.

CEVICHE $13.50
*White tuna was heavy citrus and salt.  There is no description on the menu I assume because it probably changes.  I tasted tiny lemon segments and possibly Maldon salt only because it really lingered.

ESCARGOT à la Bourguignonne $17.00
Burgundy snails, parsley-garlic butter & Bouchon Bakery puff pastry 
*6 perfectly cooked snails in a rich buttery garlic sauce.  I loved the puff pastry, added a different texture to the dish altogether.  Also used the French table bread to dip into that leftover sauce.

STEAK BOUCHON $59.00
grilled eye of the rib & sauce Béarnaise, served with French fries
*I am so used to ordering steak frites but seeing there was the grilled eye of the rib option of course we had to go for that.  Pro tip: ask to make them truffle fries - so worth it!

DESSERT:
Disappointing to be honest.  The creme brulee had almost a soupy texture, not a custard and the top sugary crust was minimal.  Also went with their daily special which was 3 petite brownies, peanut butter crumble, peanut butter caramel, ice cream and baked apples.  It wasn't very cohesive and the dish wasn't very French.  I should've went with the profiteroles.  Maybe next time.

SERVICE:
It had a nice flow and I liked that the server had the kitchen split the steak bouchon down the middle for both of us so the steak and frites were on each of our plates already when they brought our entrees.
