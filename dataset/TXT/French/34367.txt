HL6ZzGF7V-KDaU0zziHyEA Just finished a fabulous brunch today on a beautiful Sunday afternoon in Montreal. The reservation was for 130pm and the atmosphere was spectacular. Located right next to the Ritz Carlton hotel, the 2 of us were nestled in our own oasis with a pond and beautiful scenery (please see pic). 

Brunch is 39 dollars for 2 courses (app and main or main and dessert) or 49 for 3 courses. We went for 2 courses. To start we both had the baby beet salad, ruban blue fresh goat cheese, pistachios and watercress. Wow...what a salad. So fresh and each mouthful was heaven. Next up, I had the Louis d'Or stuffed agnolotti pasta, tarragon sweet peas and green asparagus. The pasta is housemade and again, wow...I didn't want it to end. My friend ordered the housemade smoked salmon and sunny side egg, potato latke, creme fraiche, red onions and capers. She seemed to really enjoy it! 

Great service, great food and amazing atmosphere. Worth checking out and make a reservation so that you can sit outside!
