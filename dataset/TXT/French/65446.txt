u_-PMjrCpr9EBRmLSWCEHQ When looking at this page on my web browser on my phone it said "Yelpers report this location is closed," which is so wrong ... It most certainly is not. 

We stopped by the Unibroue brewery around the corner because my husband thought they had a hospitality center and tours. Not so much. Hopping on the phone, we found the Fourquet Fourchette was less than a half mile away, so we hopped back in the car. Found it open. Not closed. Whew!

The restaurant was completely empty (it being 2pm) but the back patio had a couple families and friends, a nearby bike path/trail seemed to lead straight here for a wonderful water-side rest.  

We also noted that a wedding was going to be taking place, so that was kind of cool. We got to clap and cheer for the bride and groom on their special day. 

We had the beset grilled cheese sandwiches ever, followed by a monstrous charcuterie platter. Our waitress didn't know the english words for some of the things on the tray, but we didn't care. We were gonna eat it anyway. So good. Could have used a couple more slices of toasted bread, but overall... amazing. More than perfect for two of us. 

We enjoyed Maudite, Ephemere, Blonde de Chambly, Raftman (in bottle because it wan't available on tap) and la fin du monde. 

We watched the wedding party enjoy Blonde de Orange which is kind of a mimosa with beer. I took a picture of one that was returned to the bar and wished that the bartender had given it to me instead of pouring it away... ah me. Heartbreaking. 

Gift store was a little expensive but we were there and bought some beer to take home and 2 beautiful glasses. 

Overall, absolutely no complaints. Hearts and bellies full... the manager then asked if we liked beer history and recommended we swing by Bedondaine & Bedons Ronds. Which we greatly enjoyed. 

Beautiful setting, beautiful day, beautiful everything.
