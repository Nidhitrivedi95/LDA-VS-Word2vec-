ovtlrcsVRlgZZQUlHs_ovw Very interesting place, great atmosphere, good food and nice location, its the kind of place you would normally find in the Scottsdale Quarter or Cave Creek but on the west side.  

Originally I wondered about paying the price for a place that wasn't in a 'better' location; but now i have been there i decided its nice not to have made the big trip and parking hassles of those more exclusive areas. 

The meal was thoroughly worth the effort.   We got there about 730pm on a Friday and it was busy but not fully packed. 

Ordered Fois Gras, escargot and the smoked salmon, then ordered the lasagna and salmon for main course.  

Staff were quick, prompt and friendly.  Good service. 

Ambiance is really nice.
