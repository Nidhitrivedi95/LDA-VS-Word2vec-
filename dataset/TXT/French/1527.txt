0B_aEPeZjrXs6T7vS3arrA We went to Sophie's for their 7-course New Year's Eve Prix Fixe dinner a few nights ago. It was pretty pricey ($70 per person for early dinner, $85 for late dinner) but the food was very good and the service was excellent. Some of the dishes were a little challenging for me as I am not accustomed to authentic French food - we had veal sweetbread (look it up if you don't know what that is), watercress soup, rabbit and wild boar - but it was fun to try new things and I was pleasantly surprised by the watercress soup and rabbit dish and the escolar (fish) and creme brulee courses were awesome! The bread rolls are to die for. SO good. The whole affair took us nearly 2 hours and I was absolutely stuffed when we left. Best of all, despite its high brow menu, I found the restaurant very friendly and casual - not pretentious or uncomfortable for us French food newbies - even on such a special night. We even wore jeans (I called in advance to make sure it was OK and they said "of course.") The regular lunch and dinner menu is a little more conventional and less expensive. I definitely plan to come back. Their cuisine is not for everyone, but if you are a lover of French food - or new food experiences - you will love this restaurant.
