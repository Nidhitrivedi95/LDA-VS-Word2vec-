4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Food here is amazing - and for the Las Vegas strip prices are reasonable.   They have a full bar and a good wine list.  We loved their onion soup; mussels; steak; and their crepes for desert.  All in all the service was superb.  Great views of the Belagio Fountains.....and just in general watching the traffic and people walking by....

Its a great place for either an enjoyable meal with friends or a romantic dinner out.
