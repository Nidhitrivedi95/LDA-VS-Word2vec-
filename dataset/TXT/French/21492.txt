Bc3V5_JEgIDV6ONo2Hcwmg Ventured off to HoMa for a night out as oppose to our usual downtown settings. Luckily, this place has a late menu starting at 9:30pm. Stunning art deco look with a rustic touch.

Good : The grilled calamari was by far my favorite dish. Maybe even one of my top 3 fave calamari dishes. The sauce compliments it really well, and the portion was a decent size for an appetizer. The decor is beautiful inside, the lighting and ambiance is very cozy. When we arrived at the restaurant, we were greeted by a very welcoming host, and the service was pretty much spot on. I ordered the artic char, which was well cooked but nothing mind blowing.

Bad : My boyfriend ordered the goat cheese croquette, which turned out to be a big piece of breaded goat cheese. It was good, but half the portion would've sufficed. It was just a but too heavy, and the flavor was just too overpowering. We also ordered the mushroom ravioli, which sounds better than it taste. The ravioli was a bit under cooked, and the creme sauce was a bit too strong, which you can barely even taste the mushrooms. 

Bottom line : the terrace looks fantastic, which is probably great for summer. Might return again if I am in the area.
