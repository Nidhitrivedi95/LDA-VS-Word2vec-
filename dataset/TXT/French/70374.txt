X8lYvkI2Yv7f96cz4uE9LQ What a culinary experience I had dining here. It's like eating a master piece, a perfect balance of beauty and substance!  This is why I love Montréal, great food and services and value for the quality of food.

The drinks they serve are very well balance as well, not drown out by the alcohol or syrup.

The appetizers were so cheerful and bright, it simply reminded me of happy summer time.

Each of our main courses we ordered were all great on its own. I will let the pictures speak for themselves.

It such a nice little place. Too bad it can't take a party bigger than 6, else I would bring the entire party to savor the experience!

Will come back again!
