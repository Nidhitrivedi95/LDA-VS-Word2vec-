6GCbZASjMnAPYBWLc_z30g Had a satisfying breakfast here with a friend. The French toast was perfectly cooked, and my friend's strawberry waffles were excellent. Service was friendly, and we had a coupon for BOGO, which made our meal very reasonable. 

The clientele here does seem to be quite a bit older though. The combined age of both me and my friend was still younger than most of the patrons here!
