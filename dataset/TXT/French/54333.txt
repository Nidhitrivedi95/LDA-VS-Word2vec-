rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw Gorgeous bar and the interior is so French, I just adore it. 

Excellent service. I had the la varenne cocktail (cognac, liqueur, lemon juice), bone marrow au poivre appetizer, poulet roti entree with mushroom bread pudding and haricots verts, and frozen paris brest for dessert. My fiance had the pork chop. 

La varenne was a little too sweet and not strong enough. The caramelized onions that came with the bone marrow was a little too salty, but the country bread was perfect. The paris brest should probably be more of the traditional variety, as opposed to with hazelnut ice cream, as the ice cream hardened the choux pastry and made it less enjoyable altogether. 

A little bit of a limited menu.
