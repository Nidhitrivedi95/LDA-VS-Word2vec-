4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Had lunch here which was really good. The atmosphere of the restaurant is great, busy but comfortable. saw carrot top and george wallace at a table next to us.  went here for breakfast the next day which again was really good. We had reservations for lunch but did not for breakfast. For lunch we waited about 5 mins to be seated.  People who didn't have reservations were waiting for awhile so make sure to make reservations for lunch especially on the weekends. for breakfast we were seated inside with no reservations, which wasn't that bad, but sitting out in the patio is much better especially on a nice day.
