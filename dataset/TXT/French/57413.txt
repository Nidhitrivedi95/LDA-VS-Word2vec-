rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I was very excited to try this restaurant as it was nothing short of amazing reviews. But what a complete disappointment Bouchon is.  Terrible service. Food was sent to our table more than once that we did not order. Our server, after calling for her completely ignored us. And then decide to come around when she felt like it. We ordered the American breakfast, lobster hash, salad, French onion soup, and side fries. It took a long time for the food to arrive, which is completely unacceptable as the restaurant was not busy at all. The food, everything from the bread to the bacon to the sausage was so dry. What I love most about French food is that it is almost always creamy, buttery, rich, etc. None of bouchon's dishes offered anything relative to that. I would not recommend, would definitely not come back.
