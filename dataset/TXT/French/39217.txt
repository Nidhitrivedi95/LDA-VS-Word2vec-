JsAjP49bCk9KjJmmmjyM4w I was in this cafe a few weeks ago.  Not only did my wife remember having been there many years ago, but she commented that the view is really beautiful.  Outside of the broad front window is a view of Queen West's Trinity Bellwoods Park.

It's a French cafe with sandwiches (panini).  The tartes are really great and they have espresso and stuff.  The atmosphere of the place is interesting as there are many French products available, from french sparkling apple juice to French candy.  They were out of the boulangerie stuff as all of the croissants had been sold by the time in the afternoon when we arrived.

My only concern is that the staff aren't French.
