gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA My family and I went there last month and had their tasting menu, OMG, that meal made my trip.  I had a horrible time in Vegas, but this place blew me away. The view was magnificent, the staff were attentive and the food was flawless. We had a hard time trying to decide on wine and the staff were very patient with their recommendation. Best $700 I spent in Vegas :)
