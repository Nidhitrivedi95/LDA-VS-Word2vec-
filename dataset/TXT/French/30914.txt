fyJAqmweGm8VXnpU4CWGNw Oh la la!  Did you try the Pots de Creme??  (And please 'o please tell me you read that 'po' and not PoTs....oh so American if you pronounce that 'T'...or so I've been told).  But basically the P.O.C. is the size of your face and you want to sit down and eat the WHOLE thing in a single sitting, which is also 'oh so American' but not 'oh so good for the waistline.  

I ordered two sandwiches here and a pots de creme (two because I had a meal buddy, not because I'm that much of a glutton...but I sometimes can be).  Oh goodness.  The sandwiches (Croque Monsieur and the Cochon Melt) were Fabulous.  Also, not low calorie, but this is classic French Cuisine, not lean cuisine.  All was amazing.  Did I mention the Pots de Creme????  I will never share again.
