SJo_IjvzdRtCvZVN0cbrRQ What an amazing place. Mothers Day, could you pick a busier day. NO! They did an awesome job! We ordered the special "Lobster Benedict". Unfortunately we were informed they were out of it. So we chose another special the Bacon and Avocado Quiche. Very yummy. While we were waiting the (I believe he was) owner, came over with a small dish of desserts to apologize for not have the Benedict. What a wonderful touch. The service (Kyle) was fun and very attentive. Can't wait to go back again!
