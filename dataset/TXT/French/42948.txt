LQ_gYNs5E10IGFE0NOyD7A Cute little trendy restaurant.  The inside of the restaurant itself is small, but there is plenty of outdoor seating.  We ordered the pork ribs, the chopped salad and a few of the buns.  Everything was pretty good.  The portion of the ribs were quite large.  I love that the chopped salad.  It was served in a mason jar!  How cool!

We ordered a few drinks as well.  Not bad!  I'll be back!
