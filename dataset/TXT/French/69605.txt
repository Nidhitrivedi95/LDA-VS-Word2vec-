WOd8tWsh2Yt_osHv-ngx_w This is pretty much all you could ask for in a breakfast restaurant. We wanted to avoid the "chain" experience and try something a little more authentic, and this was perfect. The place was starting to fill up when we arrived around 10:30am on a Saturday, so definitely try to go earlier to avoid wait times. The menu was interesting and diverse, without omitting the classic bacon & eggs if that's what's you're going for. I had the spinach, shallots and cheddar omelette and my boyfriend had a classic with crepes - we both loved all of it. The potatoes, toast, various meats, eggs - all wonderful. The service was great. A bit of a wait time on getting the bill but that's just a testament to how popular this place is.
