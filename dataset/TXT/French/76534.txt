Exceptional meal all around. We can for a lunch and ordered the duck salad and short rib, as recommended by the waitress. Both meats were flavorful, melt in your mouth, delicious. Additionally we had a few choice cocktails which were refreshing, though a little light on alcohol content. Their bread selection was very interesting with no plain bread but an assortment of cheese, gingerbread, and fig to choose from. We ended with a complimentary macaroon. 

This was an exceptional lunch, but did run us about $100 total. I would highly recommend Tableau for a fantastic lunch (and an expected brunch just as good), but just realize you are at the Wynn and are paying for the service, quality, and ambiance.
