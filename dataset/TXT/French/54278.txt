rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw I feel rather conflicted reviewing this place...if there was an option to give 3.5 stars, that would probably be more accurate. I so very much want to rate this place 4 stars. The decor and ambiance are top notch, exuding a classy feel of a refined and upscale Parisian bistro. I also love the look and layout of their bar. Beyond this, that's where my disappointment started trickling in. Their house bread was for my preference, too hard. My latté was rather average. Their French omelette I'll have to say boasted great flavors. The cheese inside the omelette was very tasty, and the side salad with the vinaigrette cuts nicely into the heaviness/richness from the omelette. Before my main dish, I started off with their puff pastry escargot, and that I hate to admit was my biggest disappointment. Escargot is my favorite Parisian delicacy (I eat them almost everyday whenever I'm in Paris...probably not the healthiest thing to do). I definitely appreciate the different way they prepare them here, but it was quite honestly rather bland. If you're curious about trying this restaurant, I would still recommend giving it a go. Maybe at some point, I'll come back and try dinner...but I unfortunately had a less than stellar first  experience here.
