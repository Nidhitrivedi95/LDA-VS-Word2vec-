SD7vTf-H00J8BS3L-kt7jg I'm a bit ambivalent about this restaurant, but in the overall, it was OK.

The decor was really gorgeous, but we don't eat in restaurants for this: it's the food we are after. Unfortunately, I was disappointed.  The entrees and desserts were amazing, but my main course, tartar, was bland and had a boring taste.  The service was pretty cool and decent, and we were offered shooters because it was my birthday. 

The chef needs to upgrade his cooking skills, but since it's a recent place that opened two months ago, I'm ready to retest it this summer. We'll see if they upgrade or fail.
