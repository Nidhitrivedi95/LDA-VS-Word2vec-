mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q My wife and I tried the nine course chef special (I matched it with the five recommended wine pairings), but she had a couple vegetarian courses instead of Foie Gras which she doesn't like. Each course was fantastic in taste, service, presentation and wine pairing. It was the most expensive meal my wife and I have ever had, but it was a two hour event that exceeded both of our expectations.

Over the two hours the timing of the nine courses was perfect, the service was outstanding, the view of the kitchen and food preparation entertaining, and (did I already say?) the generous wine parings were perfect.

We aren't foodies and may never have a meal like this again. But if you're up for spending $500-$600 on a dinner and experience you'll remember for a longtime, this is a good choice. It's also far less expensive than Joel's three Michelin star restaurant next door.
