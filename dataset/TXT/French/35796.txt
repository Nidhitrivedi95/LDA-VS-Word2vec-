hvjgF-vnPw2jyL5DBuB0qg The service and the food was great. The waitress really helped explain the menu.
Their speciality is sea food, so try ordering at-least one dish. I had the big eye tuna appetizer and it was delicious with the right seasoning.
The portions doesn't do much justice for the price, but delicious none the less.

My only issue was with the lobster poutine. I am no poutine expert but I felt the fries were  quite burned and was a little sparse on the gravy.
