SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ My experience was poor. I was so excited to try this place after seeing and hearing so many good things. When I arrived the hostess was rude and pretended that I didn't exist until she realized that I wasn't going away. We were sat quite quickly, but it took nearly 15 minutes before our waiter came to take a drink order. I ordered ne of their signature drinks and was pleased when it arrived. Our waiter brought out bread and herb butter, but the butter was nearly frozen and impossible to spread over the cold bread. I was a little taken back by the pricing on the menu, and I'm not cheap by any means. In fact a table of eight were seated near us, and once they saw the menu, the entire party left. Well it took our waiter another 15 minutes to come back and take our order. I chose the beef tenderloin and my date chose the fish. After getting refilled three times, the waiter came to us and said that our food is coming, but that the kitchen was backed up. There weren't that many people there so I wasn;t buying it but we waited....and waited....and after 40 minutes I was brought a cold steak on a hot plate...not happy. I mentioned it to the waiter and all he said was that he could have another made. I said I didn't have another 40 minutes to waste as it was after 9PM when I got my food to begin with. He left and came back later with a huge smile and the bill. First and last time dining here. Portions are small, price is high, and I could have had the same meal for half the price some place else.
