fVF5wayDyY6ZR5oJB1IK3g Came here for brunch today. It was unique and lovely, though it gets busy and is a bit on the pricier side.

Very minimal decor, and big glass windows. There was about a 30min wait at 1pm for Sunday brunch. It passed quite quickly though. We were sat down by the owner who was our server. The tables are nice and big so there's space even though it's full. 

The menu is small, and features 10 or so various brunch creations. More unique ones, like pickled herring with bacon, eggs and rye. Or scrambled eggs with smoked trout. Which was a nice change than the regular eggs Benedict etc. 

I had the smoked trout with scrambled eggs which was excellent. The scrambled eggs was done in a very unique creamy and herby way. Also, the mimosas and bloody mary was also excellent and strong.

People I was with had the baked eggs, and the English breakfast. It all looked great and feedback was positive. 

We also tried the donuts at the end which were excellent.

It definitely leans on the pricier side, and service feels a little passive, but overall a really nice experience. Understated with quality food. The wait is a little off-putting, especially since you can't reserve for less than 6 people, but I'd definitely happily return if the opportunity came up. It seems like they change their menu often too, though I'm not sure.
