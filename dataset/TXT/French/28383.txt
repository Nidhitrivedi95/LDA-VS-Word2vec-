EEIz44ewHhOKmfTloAK13g This place is no joke.  I had to book months in advance and all I got was 530 pm on a Tuesday, so definitely plan ahead if you're hoping to get the tasting menu here (which you should!).

First, their reservation system is great.  They respond to emails which is always a plus.  They call and confirm.  I had requested to sit at the chef's bar (something else you should also do), and they were booked there, but called me a few days ahead to let me know they could in fact seat me there.  I appreciated their ease of communication.

The space itself is like a hidden speakeasy.  The entrance is off of Spadina, and the restaurant is floating above Hero Burger.  There is a hostess just inside the entrance way, in case you are lost.  Then you take a creepy elevator up three floors and the space itself is beautiful.  

The service here is bar none.  Friendly. Efficient. Impeccably.  Everyone is paying attention to everything at all times.  And yet non intrusive.  Man - I could go on and on.  I haven't had service this good in Toronto in a million years.  I'd give them 5 stars just for that.  Bravo, FOH team. BRAVO.

Here are some random thoughts before getting to the food:
- the bathrooms here are some of the nicest ones I've ever seen. I loved that they have a full length mirror in each stall, although I have heard they use distorted mirrors so you think you look better than you actual do which is kind of weird (Oh! and the bathrooms are hidden so a server will lead you/follow you)
- the bar stools were quite comfortable facing the kitchen
- the kitchen can get quite warm so wear layers
- you don't get a number for your coat, but they know exactly when you are leaving

So the food - definitely sit at the chef's table, it's so much fun to watch food come out although I think that it was most fun because we were the first people in the restaurant (obvi, at 530) so none of our courses were "ruined" but all were surprises.  

We did the wine pairings and that was very, very worth it. I was a little sad because I love bold reds, and none of the wines were like that, but you do get wine with every single course - so be prepared to get sauced!  Interesting and rare wines I'd never seen before.  The sommelier was very knowledgeable and passionate.

Now, the food. I don't want to ruin any surprises but it is seafood heavy (or, ours was).  Our favourite dish was probably the uni, so you do have to be a bit adventurous.  I've never liked uni before in Japanese preparation, so this was really interesting to me!  

I would highly recommend this restaurant for special occasions.  The final bill for two extended tastings, plus wine pairings, plus tax and tip was $500!  For two of us....hope my dining companion appreciated it!  :)
