uP3H5bcsiTXM0k0xQhRndg I had one of the best dining experiences of my life. It's a small place, seats 32, and doesn't take reservations. We were seated promptly after a short wait. We were greeted by the owner who was extremely friendly and helpful, and she reviewed in detail the entire menu, and suggested things and offered half portions. She and her family own and run the restaurant. I have never felt so welcomed as I did here.

The food was also wonderful. I had the pork belly and my spouse had a steak and both were superb. We also shared macaroni and cheese, and salad.

Highly recommended.
