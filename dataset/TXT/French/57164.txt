rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Beautiful setting especially the outdoor patio. The design is traditional French and feels authentic. I tried the eggs Benedict which was fantastic. They don't offer French press coffee but their normal drip coffee is still very flavorful and full bodied... You'll need it after a night of heavy drinking .

I'll have to go back to try some other things on the menu.
