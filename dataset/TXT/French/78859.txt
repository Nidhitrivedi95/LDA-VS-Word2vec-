ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug As a Las Vegas resident, I generally avoid restaurants on the Las Vegas strip both because local restaurants often offer better value and because of the traffic hassle. However, we needed to meet relatives who were staying at the Paris and had just experienced a 6 hour delayed flight. It seemed only courteous to meet them where they were staying after all of the travelling they had done. 

We made a reservation for seven people for 7:45pm on a Friday night, but apparently not a real busy Friday night. We arrived in three parties and thankfully were seated as we arrived. We ate "inside" rather than on the "outside" near the casino floor. This was a thankfully quiet place where we could all hear each other. The next plus was that the bread that was served was good chewy bread rolls, and unfortunately, freshly baked good bread is often not served in Las Vegas.

Three of us had the peppercorn steak. One rated it 8 out of 10, I thought the sauce could have been more subtle; the third person liked the sauce. One of us had the French dip and declared it excellent. Two had the duck a la orange; one thought the duck too lean, another liked it. The person who ordered the beef in wine sauce liked it and the person who ordered the omlette said is was okay. Service was good, there was never a need to catch the waiter's eye. 

With one of us ordering an appetizer and no one rushing through dinner, the meal lasted an hour and a quarter. To me, when you get together with relatives from out of town the meal should be a leisurely occasion. I see the speed of service is a constant source of debate in Las Vegas dining. Some people want to get in out quickly, others like myself resent a waiter asking, "Are you still working on that, sir?" 

For me the restaurant served its purpose well: A nice quiet place to have a leisurely family meal with no one rushing us and reasonably good food and excellent service.
