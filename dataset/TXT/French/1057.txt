_eNeiqWPt1MPLFF6DEIJeA From looking at the menu prior to going in we were excited, but unfortunately it was pretty underwhelming in the end. I think we tried basically all the buns; the kung pao and duck were the best by far but even they didn't really merit comment. As for our mains, most of them went largely uneaten in very large part due to being overwhelmingly underseasoned (un...seasoned...). The ramen was the best tasting, but wasn't really very special and was definitely NOT ramen. What should have been dashi ended up being a fairly thick sauce, and the noodles were vermicelli not ramen noodles, and as such they broke down almost completely in the hot not-dashi-sauce. Service was fine, but there was only one other table in the entire restaurant.

Ultimately I can't say anything was genuinely bad, but it definitely wasn't good, and gave us no incentive to return.
