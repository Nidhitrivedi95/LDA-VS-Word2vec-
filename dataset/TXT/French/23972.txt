cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg Excellent food.   I had the Boudin, the poutine with foie gras and white gravy, and the tartare made into a maki roll.  My mom had the lobster and veg (really good) the wife had Alex chop but I didn't have any.  The fries here (what my son had) are great too.  

Oh and I can't. Forget the house blonde beer.

The one thing I didn't like was the noise level.  I came here with my wife, mom and two kids (3 years and my 10 month old daughter). I know it isn't exactly a family place, but they were very welcoming and  accommodating.  The noise just reminded me of the cafeteria in grammar school, loud chatter.  It wasn't all that bad, but my son wasn't all that happy with it and my mom and wife were more annoyed than they should have been.  The atmosphere was also pleasant despite the noise.  The staff was nice and as I said, welcoming of a family with kids which is always nice.
