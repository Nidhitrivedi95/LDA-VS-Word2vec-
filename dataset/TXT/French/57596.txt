rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Throw your pinkies in the air. You need to have your pinkie in the air no matter what you're doing here, whether it's reading the menu, sipping your coffee, or taking a pee. It's that fanciful. You need to put on some "just came up" rap shit that samples Vivaldi and has delicate piano keys in the background and talks about bands or stacks or racks or birds or what have you denominations of ill begotten money to set the audio landscape that will match the views in the amazing outdoor garden in which you will consume the culinary raison d'etre. 

Oeufs brouilles et boudin en beurre blanc, bitches. Boom. That's scrambled eggs and sausage in country gravy but it's in French so fuck all that Waffle House noise. My bad, I actually love Waffle House, but again, pinkies in the air. Can't see you 'cause the money in the way and it's also this new kind of soundproofed cash being beta tested by the U.S. Mint so I can't hear you either. Fuck all that noise.

The foie gras terrine? Gangsta. My friend who was there with me commented to our server, "I love this fancy peanut butter." But he said that shit with his pinkie in the air. Real recognize real. It is what it is. Haters to the left.

The Bloody Mary here is just retarded. I mean that in a colloquial, superlative and complimentary way. The Bloody Mary here is Rain Man. Word.
