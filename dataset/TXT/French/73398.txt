xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g Wonderful introduction to see the bustling kitchen as you exit the elevator. Reservations are a must for this restaurant and we had one. We were seating promptly and just as the sun was going down and all of the lights on the strip came up! The waitstaff was excellent and the sommelier very knowledgeable and helpful. Service was excellent and the food very good, but not memorable. The food was good enough to make us come back next time, but mostly for the ambiance and view.
