4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Mon Ami Gabi was great for dinner.  Our party of three each enjoyed our meals.  The service was fast and friendly and offered great suggestions when asked.  For a great location on the strip, their prices were beyond reasonable.  Will definitely go again when the opportunity arises.
