Yp9w4nhUowBU_IS_StFXbQ Was just ok.. (Breakfast meal) Service was fine, ate on the patio in march so very pleasant and one of few places we could still have a nice breakfast at 1:30pm..

Had the eggs bene, the wasabi bloody.. (Dont waste your money on this).. A Under Seasoned and underwhelming drink for 16.00 bucks.. Someone needs to redo that drink big time... Will likely not come back. Sorry guys.. Esp at 80.00+ dollars for a basic ala carte breakfast meal.. I dont mind spending the money but come on.. Work on wowing us would ya? Its in your DNA Mr. Wynn.
