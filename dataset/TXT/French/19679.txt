Came here for the first time during a vegas super bowl get-a-way! One of my besties (Rosie) and her bf brought some back for me a few years ago, but I never got to try them fresh. The bf and I got a nutter butter, 6 French macarons, and a chocolate dipped raspberry macaron. I thought the macarons were pretty subpar. The NUTTER BUTTER was our favorite thing! It was gigantic and super delicious ! I also really enjoyed the chocolate dipped macaron minus the fact that it tasted like hazelnut when it was supposed to be raspberry, but I'm not complaining I love hazelnut. I thought the texture of the macarons were a bit too chewy. The weird thing though, the macarons tasted better the next day! Instead of becoming stale, they were of beter consistency of a macaron lol. Yum. Most def, would come back for more nutter butters  maybe try a few other flavors of the macarons.
