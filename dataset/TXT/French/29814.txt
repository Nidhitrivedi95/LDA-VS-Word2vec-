Walking up to the 2nd floor of the Ritz, you find Toca with a Euro decor to greet you.  Not plush but neat.  Music is hip. Great place to bring a special someone for sure.
On Sundays, Toca just introduced a Tapas menu  $45 will include unlimited cold and hot tapas. You also receive a main course and dessert. What a deal.  Now let's see how it tastes.
Each course is served on a sheet of slate stone.
Cold tapas: Tuna tartar - fresh firm tuna cubes that go so well on top of a bed avocados and spices puree.  Best tuna sashimi eaten in Toronto!  I had a 2nd order.
Grilled Foccacia - with figs and italian meats. Savoury, so tasty.
Crab salad - Less sophisticated than the other 2 - finely chopped and mixed with Mayo.  Not too rich, not too salty (as typically so when done this way).  Spread on the crustinis or the fresh-baked bagettes.
Hot Tapas- Frie Gras Croquettes - You get one (size of a thumb). Good but nothing special.
Stew Pearl Potatoes, Chrizo, Peas and Eggs - nice combo of ingredients.  Very yummy and best of the 3.
Vichyssoise - Rich and cremy. probably good  but not a fan.
Main Course - Seared Branzino - a fresh water fish with delicate texture. Capers, lemon and thyme flavour accentuates the fish.  Brussel sproat leaves complete the taste.  Excellent Fish!
Dessert - Pear Frangipani - So full already. Poached pear on filo pastry. 3 small Marscapone cheese spheres can be added or not.
Overall, service is top notch - Classy, knowledgeable, not pushy. Toca, you won my heart and my 1st 5 star rating ever!
