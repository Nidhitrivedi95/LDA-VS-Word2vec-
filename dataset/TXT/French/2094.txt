0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g Just went there for a special occasion dinner.  

Overall, I would say that it was about what I expected...not less, not more, and I say that in a positive way.

Unlike some other Vegas upscale restaurant, it was quiet, subdued, and great for a special occasion dinner.  We were seated at a small table next to the window where we had a great view of the fountain.

I had the tasting menu with wine pairing and wife had the prix fix menu.  

My tasting menu was lobster salad, scallop, fois gras, and I selected lamb for the main dish.  The service was impeccable, and the food was excellent.  I do agree with some other reviews that their menu seem to stay quite....eh...stable for some time.  I think it's nice to have their signature dishes, but I would think that renewing a menu for each season is a good idea to attract repeat customers.  

since the portions are quite small, I was first worried whether I might get full, but I was VERY full at the end.  They also went out of the way to change my wife's main dish to something else as she wasn't quite thrilled with her choices (as she has some food allergies).

Overall, I had a great service and food, just as I thought I would received and made for a memorable night.  Was I blown away?  No, but I've eaten at a quite few Michelin starred restaurants in many countries so I don't get blown away too easily :D
