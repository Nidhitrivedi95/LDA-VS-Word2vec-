KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA Great restaurant! Went in a couple days ago with my girlfriend. The owner was amazing he made sure we were all set up properly. We had brought in our own bottle off bubbles we still ended up buying 2 more bottles of Faust napa cab. My favorite part of our meal was their dry aged rib eye the taste was great and just the right amount of seasoning for a piece of beef. 

We left with the curiosity of coming back for brunch I'm sure we'll be back within the week!!


Thank you team!!!
