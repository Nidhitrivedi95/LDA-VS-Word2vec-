AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw The bf took me here for brunch on Saturday for my birthday.  It is quite small inside, but very cute and quaint.  We were about 15 minutes late for our reservation, but the hostess was nice enough to still seat us right away.  He had asked if they could do something nice for my birthday so they had an arrangement of chocolate covered strawberries all ready for me with a little happy birthday chocolate card, all of which were very delicious. 
 
I ordered a mimosa and the lobster eggs benedict.  My bf ordered the chicken sandwich.  His sandwich was more of a very thin panini with a side of greens.  My lobster egg benedict, on the other hand, looked amazing.  The eggs were perfectly poached and covered with a fluffy version of hollandaise over a generous portion of lobster and waffle cake.  It was melt in your mouth to die for.  I could only eat one and ended up taking the second one home.  I ate it the next day and it was still freakin' delicious!

Our server was perfectly nice but she rarely checked on us and our food took forever to come out.  Other than that, this was a great experience.  Just be prepared to pay a LOT for not so much food.  It is fine dining, after all.
