SFnrHuVFSNiondFVUBLJZQ We got into Montreal late on a Friday night and were hungry so we wanted something quick and not too heavy. We stumbled on this place. Waitress was very sweet and helpful. We had soup, salad and " breakfast" crepe. Everything was really good and fresh. We went back the next night for dessert crepes! Yummy! Share one, they are big & sit on the top floor so you can look down into the street.
