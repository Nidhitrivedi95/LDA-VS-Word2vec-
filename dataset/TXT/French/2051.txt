0oX5D44PgivB0TpgxZWjyQ Great option for good food if you live in the Laval area. Try the coxinhas as an appetizer; it's like a fried up taco ball. Their pear mojito is just fab! All 4 of us loved it. They also serve brunch I believe so I'll be checking that out quite soon.

Note: we went on a Thursday night and if got a bit rowdy and very loud. 
FYI: they have a great little private room downstairs perfect for private events.
