rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I came here for brunch with my girlfriend on a recent trip to Vegas. I'm a little torn, the service was great but overall I felt like the entire experience didn't quite live up to my expectations.

Pros: Service was on point. They don't allow reservations for brunch so we decided to get here as early as we could (easier said than done after a night out in Vegas)! We arrived around 9:00 and were seated immediately which was great, I was expecting a longer wait. Our server was friendly and very attentive. Our food came out quick and our water glasses were always refilled in a timely manner.

The ambiance here is great. The decor gives it a really classy feel, much like the rest of the Venetian hotel. Huge windows bring in a lot of natural lighting. Feels like it would be a really nice place to eat at for dinner as well.

Cons: Finding the restaurant is a little tricky. You walk through the casino and the hotel lobby towards a hall that leads to a different set of elevators. The casino does have multiple signs that help point you in the right direction.

The food was good but for the prices we paid I guess I was just expecting a little more, I wasn't really blown away like I thought I would be. Based on other user's pictures I decided to order the croque madame. Serving size was good, the dish came with a heaping side of fries. The egg on top was cooked nicely. My girlfriend ordered their omelet of the day. Again, just like the croque madame the overall dish was good but for the price I don't think it was up to par.

Would I come back again? Maybe, I would consider giving them another shot but it's not on the top of my list for brunch spots.
