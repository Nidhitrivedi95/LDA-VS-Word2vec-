_T7f2wUgNlJqxsR-cR89SQ This was a great place to take my fiancé for birthday dinner. She's a big fan of Italian, but I wanted to treat her to something different by introducing her to french cuisine. 

The atmosphere was pleasant - perfect for a romantic night out. The view from the dining room was phenomenal, a great topic of discussion and a nice place to take a picture in front of. 

The waiting staff was polite, present, and open to requests.

The wine list was extensive - a broad range of grapes varying in prices from affordable to a little pricier. 

The best part of all was the food. Perfect portions and great attention to detail. We loved the truffle fries dessert! 

I would definitely go back for a special occasion - not something for everyday outings. Unless you're ballin like that. 

Bon Appétit!
