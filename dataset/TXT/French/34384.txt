HL6ZzGF7V-KDaU0zziHyEA I went for brunch on two separate occasions a saturday and a sunday. Both times I was incredibly happy with the quality of the food and the service. The lobster roll was one of the best I have ever had in my life. It is a little pricey so I would save this place for a special occasion.
