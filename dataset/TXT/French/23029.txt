bzbNGyrTwWHAgg1CqkSgeg Loved the red velvet waffle! It was super delicious and not too sweet. The green fried tomatoes were delicious - it had a good texture and tang flavor. I would skip on the chicken since it was dry and flavorless. The service was prompt and great. It cost about $25 with tip for the waffle and two sides of the tomato and chicken.
