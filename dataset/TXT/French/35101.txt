HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw Good HH here for both food and drink options. mama ordered the Fair Trade and I got the Rose Eight. both drinks were very good. while parusing the menu, we saw another table ordered the French Onion soup. we ordered that and the Blue Crab and Avocado toast. don't order the toast. you will barely see it let alone taste it with how small it is. however, DO order the French Onion soup. IT WAS AMAZEBALLS! i've had a lot of FOS and am pretty proud of the one i make as well. but, this FOS was on another level. i had to OMG that thing. i was tempted to order another one, if it were not going to spoil our dinner plans. 

overall, great service and amazing drinks. ok prices for a casino restaurant HH at Cosmo. we'll be back.
