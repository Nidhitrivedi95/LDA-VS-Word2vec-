or4UVDjXEEjze3wNPjoAZA Overall, we had really good food and drinks for dinner here. Hit a bit of a snaffu when I ordered the halibut (they didn't have any) and an aviation (they didn't have one of the liquors that goes in the drink), both of which are on their menu. Ended up splitting the smoked salmon (AMAZING - definitely get it!) and getting the scallops for my main (really good). One of my friends thought her steak was overly salty, but it may be a personal preference.
