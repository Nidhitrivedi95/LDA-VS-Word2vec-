xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g So this review is a tad late, but still holds true I'm sure. The meal I had here was hands down one of the best, if not maybe even the best (or maybe I'm just saying this cause I can't afford to eat like this anymore since I moved to Europe) meal I've ever had. You can't get foie gras in California anymore, so of course I had to go with the legit tournedo rossini, which was pretty much, and I don't know if I've ever used this word in a review, probably not on Yelp at any rate, orgasmic. Yes, orgasmic people, I said it. It was melt in your mouth, and the textures and the flavors, me oh my. The foie gras was velvety and a great contrast to the tenderness of the filet. I don't think I even used a knife, didn't have to, I kind of just sliced through with my fork because it was like butter.

I also splurged, cause I like to go big on vacation and this was one of my last meals in the states, on the raw seafood platter. Yes it will break the bank, but again, so fresh and so clean. The lobster tail, crab legs, oysters and mussels, basically tasted like they had just been caught and brought to your table in under an hour, which we all know in the middle of the desert, wouldn't be possible, but my taste buds enjoyed thinking that it was. 

Very pricey, but you know what they say in Vegas (well other than the thing about blackmail fodder staying there, cause with facebook I think they had to scrap that particular ad campaign) go big or go home!
