kGOr_D-LNpgZ2M9N8TT4QQ I came with a group of friends for the 2015 winterlicoius lunch. 

We were really impressed by the decoration. It has classic candles at the table, big glass windows with sunshine, wood table and chairs and beautiful glass ceiling with art work. It was such a great place for a romantic date night/relaxing Sunday brunch. 
Staff is really friendly and funny, which made our lunch experience awesome. 

However, food is a little bit disappointing. 
Appetizer: Raw oyster is awesome, but the rabbit terrine is a bit dry. 
Main dish: Both chicken and salmon are dry. However the side dish was really tasteful. I love the mushroom and the vegetables and the potato.
Dessert: The warm chocolate cake is bitter, combing the sweet ice-cream, which makes it perfect. The lemon tart gets lots of compliments as well. Crème Brule is too sweet for me.  

Since it was a such lovely place, I think I will go back to try their regular menu.
