xcmmTXhuMx2fZF2Bt69F4w Still a top 3 favorite for Pittsburgh food. Recently went there for brunch and loved the eggs benedict on brioche. We came in around opening time, at 11 am, and we got served amazingly fast, so fast we were done by noon.  The only minor downside is that the place is small and therefore noisy so plan accordingly.
