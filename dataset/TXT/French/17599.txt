9ot8oInkYZTt6wkkGe__vQ I've decided to return to this restaurant as it is one of my favourite of all times. I took my brother and his girlfriend to try the summerlicious dinner. Because I wanted to get a good glass of white wine to go with the trout. I asked the waiter if it's wild caught or farmed. I thought it was a legitimate question, but his reply was "most are farmed anyways nowadays" anyways the trout can use more flavour. The only highlight was the wild honey flower with the cheese. 

Next, my brother is very allergic to apples. Again as my brother and I scanned through the menu, we saw the word "pomme" and thought there were apples in it. Again the waiter's attitude and response wasn't good at all. 

Boeuf
beef tenderloin, pickled pearl onions, watercress pesto, heritage carrots, buttermilk pomme purée

The servers that were bringing our plates out were much nicer and friendly. And they reassured my brother no apples which I liked. I rather they serve me than our waiter. He didn't make me feel comfortable with our questions. It kind of ruins the overall experience and changed my previous perspective of this restaurant. Overall I did not enjoy the meal.
