WOd8tWsh2Yt_osHv-ngx_w One of those places where when on vacation you don't have to find another eatery because they have everything you need from great food to great service. 

The seat I had allowed me to look straight into the bar area where the bartender prepared all drinks, fruit bowls and desserts. It was nice to see him cut and prepare fresh fruit for the fruit bowls and cleaned up after himself after every task. So pleased with the cleanliness of the establishment. 

I am very particular and am good for sending something back at least once. EVERYTHING WAS PERFECT & IT'S HARD FOR ME TO SAY THAT!!! 

This is a definite recommend and so happy that I only had to exit the Omni Mont Royal's door on Peel, walk 15 ft and experienced heaven in my mouth. 

BTW, I had the black olive, tomato, red onion and feta omelet which comes with home potatoes,  fresh fruit,  toast, and a cup of tea I added a fresh fruit juice (l'univers) prepared upon order (delish). 

The waiter was attentive and didn't act like it was a bother to speak to me in English. 

Shhhhhh, don't tell I'm on my way over now for breakfast before I hit the road back to the states. #goodeats #mustdo #tryityoulllikeit #dontcheatyourself
