I took my 11 y. o. son for lunch with me while on vacation. He had some difficulty with the choices and the all French menu. But he enjoyed his steak frites. I had two of the specials: a duck tartare appetizer with orange infusion and an herbaceous creme binding it together with taro chips on top, and a sausage and shrimp dumpling main course with chanterelles and bok choy in an exquisite mushroom and veal gravy. I couldn't even talk. I just wanted to savor every bite. We finished with a delicious creme brûlée and coffee. 

The neighborhood is lots of fun as well. We wandered down to Ave Mont Royal afterwards. Lovely mix of residential and little shops. 

Definitely worth a special trip to eat here! Reservations are suggested, especially for dinner.
