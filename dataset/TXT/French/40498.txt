KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA Spent a spectacular morning at Marche Bacchus.  What a view, the lake makes for a  peaceful meal and the swans are beautiful.  Our server, Rene, was superb.  Very efficient but not overbearing, always making sure our champagne glasses were full.  The food is outstanding.  We shared an order of the escargot and was thrilled.  It was the best I have ever eaten.  And you can't go wrong with the bottomless mimosas for $20.  There were 4 in our party and we all agree we will be returning to this great restaurant for brunch, lunch and dinner.  We did not even know this place existed until an offer was posted on Groupon!  I'm glad we took advantage of it.
