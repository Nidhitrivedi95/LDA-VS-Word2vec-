kGOr_D-LNpgZ2M9N8TT4QQ I've eaten at La Societe a few times now, and each outing has been solidly enjoyable, from the decor (I love the stained glass ceiling and tiled floor), to the service, to the impeccable food.

The prix fixe menu will keep me coming back because it's such a great value at about $36, but there are many a la carte items that I still plan to try. This evening I ordered the house salad, flat iron steak and chocolate cake. Previously I tried chilled tomato soup, heirloom tomato salad, mussels, cassoulet, and frites with garlic aioli. My favourites would probably be the mussels, flat iron steak, and frites.

The house salad was nice and crisp with french beans, but the creme fraiche dressing was a touch heavy-handed. I did not notice any of the advertised asparagus. The steak was very nice with no complaints (not overly-chewy -- my typical complaint for steak dishes), and I enjoyed the rich peppercorn sauce. The "gateau au chocolat chaud" was a lava chocolate cake with hazelnut ice cream and strawberries. It was a nice sedate ending to the meal, and very shareable.

I'd love to try out their brunch menu, especially once it becomes patio weather again in a short half-year or so! (They have patio heaters, which are actually quite hot to sit under, as I have experienced.)

Service is attentive without being obtrusive.
It can get pretty noisy with the after-work crowd, although one of the servers told me that Sunday and Monday nights are quieter.

Good for dates, family, and small groups (six and under). You have enough options to choose from affordable to pricey meals, delicious all the same.
