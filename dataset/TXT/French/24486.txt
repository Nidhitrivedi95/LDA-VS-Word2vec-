cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg Stopped by Au Pied de Cochon for Brunch before heading back to the states. Tough getting a reservation on a weekend for dinner, but luckily the sunday brunch is first come first served. The brunch is served almost dim sun style where they stroll a cart of brunch dishes to your table and you can pick what you want. They then proceed to mark your menu with the items taken. Just like chinese dim sum.  There are over 30 items available that range from savory to sweet, all unique or a play on some traditional fares. Very delicious and enjoyable. I highly recommend it to everyone.

I would put it for 5 stars, but have to take off one star for some organizational issues. They do the push carts, but also allow people to order directly off the menu, and thats fine. Problem is, when we ordered off the menu, some items never got to our table. they somehow got intercepted and put on the regular push cart i suppose? Half the time you dont know if a push card is for people who ordered things or if they will stop by your table. Because of this we were able to try all the item we wanted except for one, where the waiter tried to order it for us 3 times, and still it never showed. 

Other than that, of which i hope is a only rare occurrence, I highly recommend brunch here, and will hit up the dinner on my next visit.
