COuznKd_gb_N8hlOy3_i9w Disclaimer--On our maiden voyage to Zinc, we only tried the cocktails. 
But we were impressed. The server was excellent. The rest of the staff looked happy to be there (that makes me happy to see). 

Their patio, which is huge, is more of a plaza. Set back from the street in the location of the former Dollar Bank building on Euclid (just east of E. 6th), we were really impressed by how invited we felt. There wasn't any way we could resist sitting outside although it was clearly about to storm. In fact, it did start storming and we had to move inside. They were completely welcoming to us, although I made it clear we were only ordering cocktails; they sat us at a booth in the bar.  I ordered the Tiger Rogue and it was served on ice in a pint glass. Our cocktails were excellent, but mine got soupy as the ice melted.

Stealing from fellow yelper Keith Charles, I must mention the talent. After all, "going out" is about people watching. The talent was in full force...if you are a single dude looking for a cougar. I spotted my male friend eyeing several well dressed leggy women a good dozen years his senior as they walked past our booth in the bar. Hubbida hubbida may have been the words he used. It was a "classy crowd" and it should be. The dining area and bar carry out a French, romantic, bistro ambiance. 

The menu is French inspired and accessible to all; they even offer a burger. They have an extensive option for seafood, and we all loved the big pile of ice with lobsters poking out. We felt like we were on the East Coast.
