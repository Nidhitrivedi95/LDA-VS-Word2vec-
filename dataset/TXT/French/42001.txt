Kut9tVbDX_f7qKMRRoXg3w This place is fantastic. A portal into Montreal's Frenchness, with amazing duck and rabbit terrine, charcuterie plate to die for (perhaps literally), delicious French onion soup and the kids loved the hot chocolate. Passes the authentic totally French perfect vibe test. And it's an old school butcher and provisions store to boot. If only I could have stopped myself before eating ALL the food. A must visit in Old Montreal.
