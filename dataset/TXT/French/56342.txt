rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A EXCELLENT.  Went there for Mother's Day and everyone was very pleased.  All the dished were fresh and delicious.  Service was also great.  The wine selection was good.  Don't know what else to say, it was great.  We ate on the patio and there was one smoker who appeared to be walking to the pool nearby that was bad for ambiance so, recommend eating inside.  Besides it's cooler inside.
