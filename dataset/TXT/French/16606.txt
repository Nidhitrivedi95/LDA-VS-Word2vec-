8ciT6qjI18x9EPtOb-gqYQ Went for a birthday dinner, apart from having a reservation and having to wait for 20 minutes it was a great time.  Not really a french or foodie restaurant however their food and service was good... BYO is also nice change. The atmosphere is very cottage-like with tables close together, we had conversations with the tables on both sides of us.  The desserts were very good, at the time they had a pumpkin tarte that was delicious.
