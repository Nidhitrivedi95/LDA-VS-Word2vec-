SJo_IjvzdRtCvZVN0cbrRQ Slightly overpriced, but the food is delicious. Worth the splurge if you ask me. More of a treat than a neighborhood hangout. Don't get the lox plate unless you're not that hungry. The baked goods are wonderful too! Usually I just hit up the bakery rather than dining in. The service is nice but the servers can be very short.
