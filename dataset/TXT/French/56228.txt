rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Arleen is the best waitress ever! She was attentive, kind and quick. She made our first experience at Bouchon delightful. The food is amazing, the complimentary bread so good and crispy. You have to try the chicken and waffles. The chicken is crispy and the waffles were light and decadent. Everyone was super nice.
