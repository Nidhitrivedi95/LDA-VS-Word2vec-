rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Bouchon = YUM!  Even though I have visited your Yountville location close to home, I had to visit you in Vegas.  Why?  Because as soon as we flew in the first thing on our mind was food....GOOD FOOD.  We were really hungry and knew we would need a good meal to fuel us for late night clubbing plans....

Bouchon did not disappoint.  We all shared the melon and ham salad, the octopus salad, and the endive salad with a side order of fries (that was the size of an entree)!  

The bad side is that we were staying at the Venetian and even though the restaurant is in the hotel they will NOT delivery to our room (lame).  And we could NOT pre-order.  Restaurant policy is that the customer has tp be in the restaurant to place an order.  I guess we we're not high rollers (even though there was a baby grand piano in the room). Oh well..we got over it quickly and the food made up for it.

P.S. be sure to visit the walk up bakery on the Venetian Casino Floor for dessert!
