xYy54Y2VTBAG5k7WJcaH4A We had an incredible meal last night at Terra,,  I seldom go out to restaurants these days because I became so bored. So many times a lot of money paid for meals that would be described mediocre at best. Terra is an incredible exception. I enjoyed scallops over ravioli with a cream sauce that my taste buds sensed before the food hit my mouth. My friends ordered lamb and duck. They were kind enough to share. The food, wine,service were all top notch, really extraordinary.  There are a handful of restaurants in Charlotte that serve this kind of quality. I will be back again and again.
