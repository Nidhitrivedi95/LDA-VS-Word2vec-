oJZNHz5UUVUgrZwVBVlpYw Arrived at 12:50 am, yes a little late.  Was hoping to try the caviar and a nice drink.  Asked the host who seated us if it was too late to do so, she ensured us it was not.
  
Waitress finally arrived at our table around 1:04 ish, about same time I'm getting ready to get up and walk out.

She tells us kitchen closes at 1 am, so we cannot have anything but a drink.
She may be able to get me the $200 caviar and some toast, but she'll have to beg the kitchen person who will get pretty mad at her.
We left, was not worth it to us especially as we had been kept waiting for a good amount of time without even a hello.

One star because I have to give you something.
