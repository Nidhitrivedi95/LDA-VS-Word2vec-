Super spacious and open, it's got a great atmosphere. A lot of families were there when went there recently, which makes sense: it's in Philips Place, literally right next to that gigantic movie there (and near Upstream). But it wasn't annoyingly family-oriented or anything, so don't worry. 

Nothing too exciting on the wedding--just your basic Italian fare, but it gets the job done. I had penne a la vodka, my go-to, and it wasn't bad at all. Super affordable, too, which isn't always the case in Philips Place. Again, this place is really conveniently located. If you're headed for a flick, as we were, this is a great place to grab a quick but non-fast-foody meal. Equally good for a post-movie glass of wine or bite. We'll definitely be back.
