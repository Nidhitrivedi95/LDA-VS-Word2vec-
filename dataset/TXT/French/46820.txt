nkHaix6KenApS8M-liZsCQ I did one semester at the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, NY. I was young and not interested in the classic French style of culinary training. That part where they scream and yell like you are in a scene from Full Metal Jacket.

This place is the real deal in French/American cooking. There is a champagne bottle signed by Paul Bocuse in the wine case. To consistently execute at this level and be in business for as long as they have is a testament to the skill and passion that was demanded in the French kitchens of culinary legends.

I believe that if Chef Christopher Gross was to visit the CIA at some point they would take him down to the Hudson River and demand he walk on the water. Yeah it's that good.
