Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA Absolute breathtaking view atop THE Hotel at Mandalay. Do yourself a favor, get a dinner reservation for around 8pm. Enjoy a cocktail outside the lounge overlooking the strip before dinner. its a good a view as you can get anywhere on the strip.

Attentive and friendly service. Water nor cocktail glass was ever empty. 

Cocktails were delicious, ordered 3 different ones and loved each.

Food is 4 stars. Nothing mind blowing but perfectly prepared and seasoned apps and entrees. Both the Lobster and Crab salad apps are musts. Entrée was the Filet topped with a seared Foie Gras steak. It was excellent

I do think the food is slightly overpriced. You're basically paying for the view and I suppose in many ways, that part is priceless. Definitely a must visit if you haven't already
