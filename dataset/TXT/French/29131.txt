epvLkQNL6MOvk3s6JlTntA I am pretentious and I love pretension.  Carmon's offers pretension and delicious taste all at once.  I came in for brunch this morning, and loved the atmosphere, the overdone fin-de-siecle details, and....the crepes.

I had a delightful buckweat crepe filled with eggs and bacon that was far more classy than a savoury breakfasty thing had any right being.  I was also incredibly nervous as I was sitting with a Harvard professor and talking about Woodrow Wilson, or perhaps just from the very strong double espresso they whipped up here.  Speaking of coffee, if you get a chance, order a cup of regular filter coffee.  They'll pour you a refill from a ginormous metal coffee urn that looks like it was filched from Scheherezade's palace.  No, seriously, it does.  Or from Toulouse LaTrec (at least the John Leguizamo version).

Well worth a trip for brunch.
