I enjoyed a delicious and fresh salad and a the Duck Confit!  So freaking good. You will want to make it your lover.  Lots of bread and butter was served before and with our dinner and the French red wine, recommended by our server, was exceptional.  For dessert, Hubby and I split a luscious Crème brûlée.

I love the restaurant name which translates as "Two Round Kids".  If I ate here every night, I would definitely be a round kid.  Depending on where you are staying, you may have to take the Metro to this neighborhood that is a mix of shopping and dining.
