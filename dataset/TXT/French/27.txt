-4TMQnQJW1yd6NqGRDvAeA Met friends here last night for our second enjoyable dining experience at this fine dining establishment.  This time we chose to eat inside, although the outdoor area is lovely, albeit due to the somewhat confined area, we had noted the tables to be somewhat small in accommodating everyone's plates, water and wine glasses during the main course.

It was the first time for the couple we had joined us and they were very pleased with our selection, except for the lack of valet service I'd assured them The House provided as they had last time. My husband and I had lucked out by getting the last spot in the small parking lot but in downtown Scottsdale at prime dining hour on a Saturday night, spots are not easy to come by. Apparently, there's a little known lot around the corner in which patrons can park but it would help to be made aware of this at time of reservations/confirmation. 

In any event, we sat directly across from the kitchen but were pleased to see - and hear - that not only was it not noisy, but how efficiently orders were placed (with attention to detail as my husband and I heard while awaiting our friends arrival) - and then picked up for delivery to the tables. Our own selections were well prepared to our specifications with the appropriate amounts of time between seating, ordering and courses being brought to the table. My husband and I both enjoyed the arugula salad followed by chicken atop risotto - at first we thought the entree looked small and regretted not having ordered a side dish but it turned out to be plentiful and succulent. Our friend is wine enthusiast so we deferred to him for our wine selections and were pleased with his choices.  

Aside from the presentation and preparation, the staff was attentive, accommodating and friendly.  Truly made for an excellent dining experience.
