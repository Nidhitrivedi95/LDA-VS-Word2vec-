3jKUbhGSjFTv5jZ0wnW0xA We love spending a few days in Montreal and sampling the cuisine, on a recent visit we decided we were staying close enough ro Prince Arthur and for old times sake we would go there for dinner. Lucky for us we chose Les Deux Gamins. It did not disappoint, it is a lovely resturant with a warm friendly atmosphere. I have to say we decided to walk from the Hilton Garden Inn, it took us 25 minutes, unfortunately in a torrential rain, my hair looked like I had just walked out of the shower. 
We both wanted a salad meal, something light but tasty, my husband had the salad Nicose, it looked like a picture, the perfectly grilled tuna was outstanding. I had the salad with duck confit that too was very nicely done, great balanced dressing. We had no room for desert, but really wished we had, next time.
Our only problem was the length of time it took to get our meal, if that could be remedied LDG would get 5 stars.
