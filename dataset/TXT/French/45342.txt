mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q Best meal I've ever had by far. We both went with the chefs pre fix menu and wine paring. Its not your typical romantic nice dinner place. Its a bit more hip. 

The service was great and it was nice to see the chefs cooking and plating your dishes. A very cool experience. We sat at the bar seating which I feel is the best spot. You get to really talk about your meal and wines with your server. Think bartender of food and drink. 

We spent 650 for two without too and tax. So 800 out the door. Of course you could eat for less but I think for the experience its best to do the chefs menu.
