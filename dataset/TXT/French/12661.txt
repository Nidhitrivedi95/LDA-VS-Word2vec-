4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Saw great reviews on Yelp, so we thought we'd give it a try for dinner.  We had such a great experience we went back the next day for breakfast and then had dinner later that day as well.  We were seated on the patio in each case with a very short wait (we were early for dinner).  The atmosphere and service was excellent and pricing was very reasonable in each case.

We started our first dinner by sharing the Frisee and Kale salad.  Flavors were outstanding with a poached egg highlight.  I rarely order steak, but my steak bordelaise was excellent (thin cut, but tender) and my wife's hanger steak with merlot butter was tender and very flavorful.  The potato chip/fries on both entrees were salty and crispy.

For breakfast I had the turkey & egg white omelette and my wife had eggs benedict and both were excellent.

We started our second dinner by sharing the duck confit.  It was a generous helping with dark, tender meat accented with balsamic cherries.  This paired with the baguette bread could have been a meal itself.  For my entree, I have the lamb shank (large and again awesome) and my wife had the sea scallops.  The scallops were melt in your mouth and the brussel sprouts were the best she's ever had.

All great experiences. We know where we'll be going again the next time we're in Vegas.
