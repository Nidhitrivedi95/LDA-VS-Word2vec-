0nddnkjG1RV8hdFdy_wCMA This is by far my most favorite tradition  - I pay homage every time I visit Toronto.
Patisseries like this just do not exist anymore - a pastry art that is far and few!
Butter croissants, almond croissants, french almond custard tarts and windows of endless quiche - try the onion & bacon or the roquefort....COMPLETEMENT EXCEPTIONNEL!!
In my travels, I search for comparable pastry but I am secretly proud that nothing compares. Get here early so you can have your choice of goodies.
I love the small, quaint feel of only hearing French spoken over coffee and a newspaper.
I am told the Pain Perdu is all low-calorie ha ha ha!! and worth every little bit!!
Ah such a blessing to visit every time - A BIENTOT!!
