bzbNGyrTwWHAgg1CqkSgeg I always have high hopes for brunch. Checking Yelp beforehand, I decided Terrace Cafe would be worth trying. It certainly did not disappoint.

Terrace Cafe is one of the few places that I know of in Charlotte that does brunch on Saturdays. They also don't take reservations, so expect a wait due to its popularity. I went with my boyfriend at 11:40AM on Saturday and were seated within 30 minutes.

Their bloody marys were good. Warning: the Diablo Bloody Mary was very spicy, but the others were of normal intensity. We ordered the shrimp & grits, chocolate chip waffle, and biscuits & gravy. The shrimp & grits was good, but I wasn't a huge fan of the sauce they had. The waffle was a good cake-y consistency (I prefer it that way). The biscuits & gravy were to die for. And I've grown up in the south my whole life. 

All in all, I had a good experience. Food was good, service was quick and accommodating, and the restaurant had a good vibe to its decor.
