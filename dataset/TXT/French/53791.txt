qmh6zxtJ8C8-YiUPv7ySlw OMG! Ok, we went here for my Bday dinner...

To start off we had 3 different types of cheese and a Sauvignon blanc- the cheese was served with grapes, raisins (dried on the vine), a honey butter sauce, some type of nut, dried figs and dried cherries. This was all AWESOME. 

Second, I ordered the lobster bisque - Let me tell you, this was the best I've ever had. it had blackened corn and two small lobsters in it. My hubby ordered the escargot - it was Alright. We shared both. 

Main course- we both ordered the short rib and a bottle of Pinot Nior (recommended by the somalie(sp)). The rib was so tender, it melted in your mouth. It came with a small amount of augratin type potato and steamed spinach. It was a superb meal and the wine was excellent.
