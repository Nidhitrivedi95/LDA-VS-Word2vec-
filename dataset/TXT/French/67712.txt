UxWH8zRYIBgs6Q2oykvRdw I live upstairs from Cluny and have eaten there before with adequate results (food decent, menu not available (apparently on whim of the chef), service gets by). 
However, I just tried to order take out from this restaurant and was highly disappointed. I called ahead to ask if they offered take out and was told, yes, but that I'd have to come in to order. Annoying, but fine - at least I had the option to not waste my time. After deciding to go down to order and then wait for the food to be prepared, I was ignored a hostess, before being told that I must order from the bar. 

After being ignored by the bartenders for about 5 minutes, I asked one when he came close if I could order some food to go when he had a moment. He then proceeded to inform me that it would be TEN MINUTES before he could TAKE the order (after which of course, I would need to wait for it to be ready). IT'S MONDAY, the restaurant and bar were not full (and I have two years of waitressing experience to help me judge that!)
 
I then asked the hostess if someone else could take my order as the bartender wouldn't be able to do so for some time. She informed by that maybe a manager could, but made no move to find them - advising me to just wait at the bar. 

Needless to say, I left, and went to the much friendlier Mill St Brewery 100 feet away. 

It seems that Cluny has decided to maintain a facade of French snobbery, proving that they seemingly have not actually travelled to Paris, where exquisite service is a profession and people take pride in their work.
