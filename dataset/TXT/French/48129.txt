O66Zy8Y13VBm72ZDhS4fIg Came here on a Friday night for snacks and cocktails and was blown away.

Ambiance:
An amazing pianist was playing through most of the night. Honestly couldn't get enough of his soulful singing. The decor is on point and the lighting is perfect for an intimate date. There was a woman sitting next to the pianist with a book and a glass of wine. You could tell she goes to Sassafraz often for the ambiance. 

Service:
Our waiter was named Jon and we agreed that he was the best waiter we've had in a long time. He was friendly, attentive and really knew his alcohol. He made several drink recommendations all of which were extraordinary. 

Food and drinks:
That brings me to my third point. We only had some fries and dessert so can't comment on entrees. The food we did have was absolutely delicious. The cocktails again were exemplary. We had just finished with drinks and dinner at Scaddabush and were not impressed with their cocktails. Going to Sassafraz afterwards was like comparing night and day.

Recommendation:
Great date place and go on a Friday night when the pianist is there.
