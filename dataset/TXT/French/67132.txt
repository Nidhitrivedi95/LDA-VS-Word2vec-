USleI8g1UVN9-9jm-b4uIg We went here because of the great reviews on here and ended up not liking it so much. We started with an octopus appetizer which was pretty good and went onto to our entrees I had the Elk chop and my husband had the Grouper with Lobster. 
The Elk chop was nice and tender and the horseradish spaetzel was okay. The grouper and lobster was pretty good too. However the reason why I am giving it three stars is because I think it is a little over priced. Our total came out to be around $150 including two glasses of wine. I think the overall experience was good but for my husband and I, the food here was not worth the total on the bill. We don't mind paying for a nice meal but not if the food is not worth it.
