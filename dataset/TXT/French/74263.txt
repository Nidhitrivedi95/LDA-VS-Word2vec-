xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g REVIEW JUST FOR COCKTAILS:

I was in Vegas with my wife and another couple we know in November 2012, and we decided to grab cocktails at the Eiffel Tower Restaurant bar in the late afternoon.  While the cocktails were pricey, the view rocked as did the drinks.  The French Martini ($16)  was outstanding as was the Vesper ($18)and New Wave ($18).  Our server, Molly, did a great job.  

I can't attest ot the food, but for a cocktail and a chill session, this place is great!
