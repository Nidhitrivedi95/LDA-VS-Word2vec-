I ordered 8 raspberry donut holes which were h e a v en ly. I also ordered 8 macarons: strawberry, blueberry(yum), chocolate mint (yum), ginger (interestingly yum), vanilla, peanut butter, coffee, & rose. Vegas doesn't have many renowned bakery options, and I wanted to get unique birthday sweets for my sweetheart & I think I made the perfect choice! 

However, I would have loved to got him a macaron cake, but maybe next time. It also would have been great to dine in because the atmosphere just feels unlike anything in Las Vegas. The art installations and other food display added a very surreal touch. The lady who helped me was very nice, extremely helpful, and patient, especially through my indecision. She also had a cool accent which somehow added to the whole surreal and awesome experience and I highly recommend this for quality treats.
