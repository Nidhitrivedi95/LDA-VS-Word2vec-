0d6kx6Jlocw77y1J9nbqMA I just happened to drive by here today when I was in need of some sustenance.

I was figuring I would walk in to a heavenly 
bakery full of pastries galore.

Not really. 
I saw a half naked bakery case scattered with random desserts, no pastry, and honestly none of them looked appealing to me.

But that's OK, I was happy to see that they had some regular food items like sandwiches and quiche on the menu.

I'm a Quiche Lover~ I did not Love their quiche.(see pics)
It looks quite pretty but unfortunately it was lacking any and all flavor and the crust was really hard and tasted like cardboard. Boo.

I did not care for their version of a 
vinaigrette either it was very thick and sticky.
I also ordered an ice tea, and got a choice of fruity or minty, 
I chose fruity.
Strangely enough it tasted
like a mix of the two and I didn't care for it much.

Sadly I have to give only 2 stars based on the quiche maybe their desserts are better?
