rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A We've been to Bouchon a few times for brunch and always have a great experience.

My personal favorite is the roasted chicken and waffles. It is not the typical fried chicken and waffles that you see a lot, it is perfectly roasted with the skin on. The chive waffles are nice as well.

The Croque Madame and American Breakfast are always a hit too.
