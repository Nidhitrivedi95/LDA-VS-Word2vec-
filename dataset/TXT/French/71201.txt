xcmmTXhuMx2fZF2Bt69F4w We came here for brunch and the food was amazing! I had the potato streudel, the eggs benedict with crab cakes, and a mimosa. My food was amazing, maybe the best eggs benedict I've ever had. The service was awful (and I can't stress that enough), so you should know that going in and prepare yourself to wait for food, refills, etc. Otherwise, this is a really fun place with good energy, and the food is delicious.
