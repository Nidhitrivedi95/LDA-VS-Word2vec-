Some of our favorites are the crab cakes (perfectly cooked and seasoned); cafe greens salad; fish & chips (best); peanut butter shake (to die for); Alfredo pasta with chicken; skinny French fries; calamari; and butternut squash soup with miso rock shrimp and roasted leeks (amazing). Atmosphere is casual and they serve wine and beer. Best of all it's all organic. It's tucked away in the Trails shopping center in Summerlin. Definitely one of our favorites.
