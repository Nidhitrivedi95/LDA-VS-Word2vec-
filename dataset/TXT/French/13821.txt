50-xiTYmE6NERi-yJ6NvHw I came here for dinner before heading to the Aquarium. My friend and I ordered 24 oysters that were $1, charcuterie board and pig's ears. The oysters were delicious and I have no complaint for $1 each. I also really enjoyed the charcuterie board. I've never been a fan of pig's ears but I think Biff's made it particularly poorly. I would stick to ordering it at a Chinese restaurant. I also ordered a drink - not your grandma's fruit cake. What drew me to the drink was the pumpkin cider which I could actually taste in this drink! I thought the drink was well made. Lastly, we ordered dessert. I don't remember what I ordered but my friend ordered artisanal ice creams and sorbets and I remember it being very flavourful!

I definitely want to come back here and try an actually entree. It was a fun night at Biff's!
