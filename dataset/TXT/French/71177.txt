xcmmTXhuMx2fZF2Bt69F4w yum. crab cakes for appetizer - 2 pretty large crab cakes w/ some salad in the middle. definitely not your regular tiny, oily frozen crab cakes that you get at other places

i had the braised beef for dinner - it was a little salty but still really delicious, especially loved the frites. SO GOOD!!! if it doesn't come w/ your entree, make sure you order it as an appetizer! (although it comes w/ most entrees and everyone basically got the mussels that come w/ them)

my bf had the seafood waterzooi - i just looked on their menu though and it said a tomato base... but his was all white, he said it tasted like white wine. dunno how i feel about them not having the right ingredients and simply substituting w/o telling us. he really liked it though regardless

the entree did take a while to come out though, that was kind of annoying. i saw a couple who came in maybe 15-20 after us get their entrees about 10 minutes before we got ours. BOO. 

the wait and substitution of ingredients = -1 star

we went around 6pm on a tuesday night and had a 30min wait, but after our wait was over another couple walked in and their wait was only 10min, so i'd suggest going on a weekday to avoid the lines - place is pretty small
