0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g I really enjoyed Picasso from start to finish. 

We had a 630 reservation and when we were seated the waiter asked if we were heading to a show later in the evening and assured us we would be out on time.

we were a table of 4 and we all ordered the 128 fixed price menu including 5 courses.

All the courses were delicious and plated very nicely. But the 2 that stood out to me were the scallop and Foie Gras. The scallop was large and perfectly cooked with the perfect texture. The Foie Gras...oh man the Foie Gras was the most divine and decadent thing i've ever tasted. The portion was extremely generous, it could have been served as a main course...and it just melted in your mouth. OMG i would go back solely for the foie gras. I wanted to savour every bite.

The service was attentive but not intrusive, and everything was on point for that night. it made our dining experience very enjoyable, plus you're surrounded by original picasso artwork and you get a great view of the bellagio fountains. It would have been nice to get a seat out on the patio, but unfortunately we were not VIP enough.

To end our experience at Picasso, we were given a box of muffins for the next day....the box was really nice!

Picasso, I'll be back...for the Foie Gras.
