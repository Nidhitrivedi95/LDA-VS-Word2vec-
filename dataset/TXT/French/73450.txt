xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g You will definitely enjoy a meal here.  The restaurant makes every attempt to live up the the expectations of fine dining.  There is a dress code and the staff are all dressed in their Sunday best as well.

The atmosphere is intimate and the service is fairly attentive.  This place is always busy so it's hard to get the attention you probably feel you deserve for the tip you will feel obligated to leave.

I remember our food taking a while to come out, but also remember it being worth the wait.  It was all cooked to perfection and the portion sizes were spot on.

Would definitely go back.
