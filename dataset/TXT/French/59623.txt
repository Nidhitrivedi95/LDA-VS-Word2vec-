s1NqIkLMCFX6PuTk6wt6QA I love this quirky little diner a hop skip from gorgeous Park Lafontaine. It's usually jammed on the weekends with the brunch crowd and I'm not often in that neighborhood but last week I went for lunch with a friend and was reminded how sweet that spot can be. 

Any place with booths generally wins me over (especially if they are red or black...) and Anecdote indeed has booths 1950's diner style and the back section also has a raised area with kitschy tables and chairs. The staff are friendly and attentive - this time round' the waitress quickly confirming there was no dairy in the soup of the day that my lactose-intolerant friend had ordered.

Now I'm by no means a vegetarian but I remember going there for the veggie club and fries which was memorable. After scanning the comprehensive burger list (friends swear by their classic Anecdote burger and they have some other interesting options like 'cerf', 'bison' etc.) I settled on a tofu-dog all dressed and fries. It was exactly what I wanted and the whole meal was under $6.00! They also have a really adorable kids menu for $4.95 and under - so family-friendly as well. 

Things can get pricey though as sides are extra but generally the prices are reasonable for what you get. They also have many great breakfast options...
