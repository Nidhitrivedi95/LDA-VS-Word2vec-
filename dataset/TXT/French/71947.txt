XI3iNUgChOfJk5ppjKVEQQ I was mildly concerned given the location on St. Paul. The menu certainly wasn't as ambitious as at our previous night's dinner spot, les 400 Coups. But good restaurants exist in tourist neighborhoods; and a simple, well-prepared menu is a great virtue, too.

Barroco turned out to be not as good as les 400 Coups. But that's not a fair barometer. Barroco was certainly better than I'd feared, and also certainly better than it needed to be.

Burrata came with a nice variety of ripe heirloom tomatoes. It wasn't laden down with oils and heavy dressing. A pleasant surprise, especially given that I hadn't intended to order it (sometimes things just come out of my mouth). The cheese was creamy, but not excessive.

The branzino (another unexpected order on my part) also turned out to be quite good. A little oily. And it did not require the valiant service of macadamia nuts. But again, very, very passable.

I also enjoyed panna cotta, partly because I am a dessert baby. It came with some sort of inscrutable minty green topping. But I cannot say that I was too disturbed by that.
