KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA I hate giving low ratings, I gave them a 1 star because the service sucked so bad tonight. Sure the ambience and the food was ok. But I'm just shocked how the service was based on the good yelp reviews. Tonight we were a group of 12 girls, celebrating a girl friend's birthday. Our server Marty was nice at first, but seemed to be elsewhere at the rest of the meal. I understand we're a larger group, but he didn't ask if we were paying together or separate at the beg of the meal ( that's a no brainer in the food and bev industry with a larger group - I know it's annoying to, but still, for convenience of the group, obviously ppl have cards and cash ), it must be our fault because we forgot to state we wanted to split our bill at the end of the meal. Our appetizers, and salad didn't arrive at the same time, half of the groups arrived 10 mins later for a salad? No apologies on our server's part. As the salads were arriving, the entrees came. And what irked me, is when the server asked if we were ordering dessert, as I remembered I forgot to ask to split my check because my son was crying at home - he stated in a rude tone that we didn't say to split the check in the beg, and there was nothing he could do. As he was walking off, I could hear him make a snarky comment about the whole check splitting thing. In the end of a $400 bill for 12 girls, and that's including tax - it wasn't worth $36, and for me to give him a 15% tip, I shouldn't have. It was suppose to be a great night, but we literally wasted an hour and a half trying to figure out our check. There was a lot of should've, would've, could've with the service. I will not be dining again, and will not be referring my friends. Maybe it's good for a smaller group or another server other than Marty.
