Tl2nqtPXlLbAG3qkUYVM2g We reserved the private dining room for a business group meeting. Room is quite small but enough for a table of 12 or so. Vincent's has a small-ish valet parking area outside. If you want to park yourself you could do so at the 7-11 next door. 
Vincent's is classy, dark, and ambient. It feels European with its small wood tables and chairs, paintings and prints, and emphasis on quality over quantity, both in regards of food as well as service. 
Our server was extremely nice and accommodating. She hooked us up with Wifi (worked very well) because for some reason there is virtually zero T-mobile signal there. She and her colleague were always there to make sure we had everything we needed and our glasses always full, but never pestering or overbearing. She even recommended AGAINST a menu item one of us was considering, something I've very rarely experienced. Usually servers sugar coat everything. 
 
The food was very good, high quality and clearly made with love. I had the lamb chops which were perfect. They came with  small sides of potato gratin and asparagus. Very simple, classy, and delicious. The portions were very small which is to be expected from a French-inspired place like Vincent's but maybe they could give patrons just a little bit more. 
The wild boar one of my colleagues ordered looked equally delicious and she said she loved it. For desert we tried the Grand Marnier creme brulee which was basically just creme brulee on top of 2 shots of Grand Marnier (pass unless you really, really love Grand Marnier). 
Overall a nice, quiet, classy experience. I never saw the bill but I imagine it was pretty lofty. Would definitely go there again. I can't give it 5 stars because while the food was good, it simply wasn't outstanding, and the portion sizes bordered a bit on stingy.
