rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w Le Cirque has a long history of compliments. The staff here is original from the day it opened. This is where you go to have the finest French/Italian food that Vegas can offer. My husband and I have had the honor of going here frequently on our trips to Vegas. Ivo still is the best maitre d' in any restaurant you will go to. He sets the stage of giving a comfortable, relaxed, elegant and sophisticated atmosphere. We ask for Jimmy to be our waiter when we reserve our table and he continues to bring a refined joy each time we visit. The staff here is top notch and will make accommodations to help make your dining experience the very finest. 

Now the food...risotto? Nobody does it better. Lobster salad and Creme Brûlée? That's the beautiful history of Le Cirque and classics that have a fan base like no other restaurant. The chocolate sphere still continues to delight patrons. You will not go wrong ordering anything from this restaurant. They treat the food with the utmost respect. 

Tonight was a Christmas gift of enjoying their food and company and I look forward to seeing them again.
