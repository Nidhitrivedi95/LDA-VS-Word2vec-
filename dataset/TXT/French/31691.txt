gLuaw6h5WgImHpjseAHVrQ I was there for sunday brunch. The place was not full and the only 2 servers were overwhelmed!! They should have at least one busboy and one hostess for these few hours. Service was very cordial but you can tell that they could not manage the flow.. the food was ok, but nothing to brag about. Deco is awesome! I will return for the evening menu, hopefully they will have more staff, or not, but the pace is usually slower than brunch!
