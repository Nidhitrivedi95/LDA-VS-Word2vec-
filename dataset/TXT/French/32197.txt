gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA First time I was here, was 1 year ago. Maybe I am here on the chefs day off, but tonight was especially bad. I was by myself so I expect service to run a little slower but it took 10 minutes to order a cocktail. another 10 for a menu and 30 more for bread (the butter was already on the table). When I finally received my meal, the gnocchi was in a pan of oil. The duck breast was nearly white it was so over cooked. The only reasons this was not a 1 star review was the kale and the attention of pulling your chair anytime after you get up and we're heading to the restroom. The kale was exceptional. But I am truly unhappy with the service and price of what is a mediocre restaurant with a great view.
