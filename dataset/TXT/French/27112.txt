dd3GZs6zW2t7BM0cbxAzvg knowing that i've been wanting to try la palette for the longest time, my bf took me here for our anniversary . now that i have been, i have mixed feelings towards it . i went in, wanting to fall in love with it so maybe i went with too much of a high expectation . 

i absolutely loved the atmosphere . with the cozy decor & the dimmed lights .. but not at ALL pretentious ! even my bf felt comfortable here . i really wish i had the chance to try them out when they were at the kensington location . i heard it was even cozier ! servers were very attentive & everything came out timely . extra star just for the atmosphere & the service .

now the food . 
for app: we ordered the escargot & foie gras (we always order foie gras whenever we can after trying them for the first time at hoof cafe!) . it was my very first time trying escargot and for such exotic food such as this, i expected it would be much more flavorful . foie gras was wonderful but we still prefer hoof cafe's . just a little .
for entrees: my bf got the bison steak . it was good but some part of the steak was wayy too salty . perfectly cooked med rare tho . i had the game meat (elk that evening) and it was just okay . the bf liked it a lot more than i did . i LOVE french food so this was a bit of a disappointment . :(
dessert: we just ordered what looked like a chocolate brownie . sounded amazing on menu, but nothing spectacular .
