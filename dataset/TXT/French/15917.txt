Summary of this eatery (definitely not worthy of being called a restaurant), the food was both horrible tasting (extremely salty) and expensive. The added bonus I got was raw chicken which the kitchen claimed it was "cooked". A total waste of money!!! 

Here's the long version. My dad and I were catching a long haul flight at Pearson, and saw this restaurant which seemed to be offering warm noodle soup and dim sum. I had mentally prepared for the authenticity of the place, however, the food was much worse than expected and was extremely expensive for what it is. 

I had gotten the Pad Thai with chicken on the side (an extra $5). I had expected the chicken to be incorporated into the Pad thai, it instead came out as a skewer with 3 pieces (cold on the outside, and pink in the middle refer to photo) - not sure about you guys but that's not what I look for in chicken. I had complained about it, and was brought another skewer, and the waiter saying the kitchen checked the temperature of the chicken and said it was okay (really not sure what broken thermometer they used). On top of the raw chicken, the Pad thai was swimming in soy sauce. It was so salty but I was extremely hungry.

My dad had gotten a beef noodle soup with shrimp wonton noodles. Also very mediocre, but he doesn't complain as much as I do.

The total of the meal came to $60 with tip, NO drinks, just two horribly cooked meals. 

Stay far away from this place if you can!!
