The service is friendly and exceptional.  Being an individual who smokes and enjoys 3-5 cigars daily and I've patronized many cigar shops and lounges, I really enjoy the small private feeling environment and atmosphere of this place.  The cigar selection is minimal so I recommend you bringing your own as you may not find what your palate desires.  I'd frequent here more often for a cigar, however, mobile connection is sporadic at best in case you need to be connected or need to do some work/business over a cigar.
