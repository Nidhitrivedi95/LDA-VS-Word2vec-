K2C8dSx9215LLcIzHL959Q Wife and I had dinner there with another couple, & upon entering the establishment, I was immediately disappointed by decor & lighting.  My disappointment was quickly dismissed by the excellent service and presentment of  beautifully & elegantly crafted cocktails, which included orchid ice cubes that brought joy to the entire table!  The good vibe created by the cocktails continued as the soup and apps came with flavors that aroused all of our senses.
Another round of drinks and then came the duck, the lamb, the grits as we all devoured the amazing flavors presented to us.  
 Lastly came the dessert chocolate mousse presented by the owner/chef table side with a liquid nitrogen show!!! Get past the spot and enjoy the incredible talented  chefs flavors! I promise you will not be disappointed.
