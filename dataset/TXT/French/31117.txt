gECTGhoToWi4PPxhSlJ40g Delicious poutine! We came here two years ago while staying at a cabin and made a special trip to Lachute on our way back from Saint Hippolyte to taste it again. So good! Squeaky curd as it should be and tasty gravy. A little on the messy side since it's served in a styrofoam container loaded to overflowing in a paper bag.

Try the Guedille hot dog too. No wiener, but a mix of onion, mushroom, and cheese.

Staff are friendly and helpful.
