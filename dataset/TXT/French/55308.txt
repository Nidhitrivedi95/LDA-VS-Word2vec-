rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Went for dinner.  Sat at the bar.  The server did not know what kinds of oysters they had.  She also did not know what was on the cheese plate.  The food was nothing exciting.  Was served one of the worst glasses of wine (Syrah).  It wasn't corked, just tasted awful.  And that was after I waited 20 minutes to get it.  There were a bunch of managers standing around too while our server was clearly weeded.  I should have made them aware and not run to Yelp but we just wanted to get out of there after spending a load of money on a bad experience.
