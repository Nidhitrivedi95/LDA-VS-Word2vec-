4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw One of my favorite places to eat. We sat outside in front of the bellagio fountain this time because I wanted to show him fountain show while we had our lunch. We tried the escargot, he got the special sausage sandwich of the day, and I got the fish of the day which was the swordfish. Loved the swordfish. Fish was cooked perfectly with sauce and the tomatoes were delicious. View was breath taking and people were walking around the strip so it was nice to see different faces. Love love it.
