1aj4TG0eFq6NaPBKk6bK7Q Amazing! After looking for multiple places to have breakfast, we settled on Jacques. The service was great! The girl up front was very helpful and convinced me ( a non-omelet eater) to get the langostina omelet. It was amazing. Highly recommend the French toast and salmon on croissant as well! We will definitely be going back.
