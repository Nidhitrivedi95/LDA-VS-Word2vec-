The oyster on special we had were impeccable - obviously that's about the sourcing, but the frozen mignonette was a delightful addition. 

The Elk chop was beautifully cooked, with a magnificent sauce and really lovely sides. The lamb unfortunately was overcooked - not served at the requested medium rare - but they were happy to replace it but both diners declined. Still the sauce and sides drew raves.

So, a less than perfect meal but still a delightful experience , and I wouldn't hesitate to go back.
