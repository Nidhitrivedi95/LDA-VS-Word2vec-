RfsMUrGUJdrpfrU54rmEsQ I was not impressed with this restaurant. We tried late lunch around 3:00 pm...I know it is my fault for not reading, it is not a place to bring kids. They don't have a kids menu of course so they recommended meat balls and fries. The meat balls were super spicy for a child!
Our entrees were OK but nothing impressive... We won't go back.
