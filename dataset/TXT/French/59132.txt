rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w I get that they have a dress code; that's fine. But they didn't let one male in our party in because he wasn't dressed nicely enough, then right behind us they let 2 women who were in shorts, t-shirts and looked like they just walked up the entire strip in 100 degree weather. We ended up going right down the hall to a place that had a better ambiance and wasn't so snooty. This place just wasn't for us. It's also really dark inside; there are places that have just as high quality with better seating, in my opinion.
