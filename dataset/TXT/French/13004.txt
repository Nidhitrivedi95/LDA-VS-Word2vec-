4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Came here once for lunch and was not happy with the service. The place is really nice and big, good for large and small parties. We got sat outside under the dome so we got a nice view of the Strip and the sky. 

Waited a bit for our server to take our drink orders, my sister asked which flavors for coffee they offer and the guy said "We have them all" along with a dismissive hand gesture like we annoyed him by asking... like really? I highly doubt that they have ALL the flavors. I don't know if he was just too busy or give us a few options or he didn't know... he could have answered in a more polite manner. 

We ordered the housemade country pate which was really good! The pate was so creamy and smooth, it was delicious. I got the Salmon, Spinach and Baby Kale Salad and my sister got the Classic Quiche Lorraine - both were pretty good. 

I would definitely come back for the food, but for a nice place on the Strip, the service needs improvement. Not criticizing the entire restaurant, but our server really ruined our first impression of the place.
