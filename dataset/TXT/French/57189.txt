We were seated at a beautiful outside table overlooking a pool and garden on a lovely crisp morning.

Started with a Bellini (champagne and peach) which was very refreshing.  My husband ordered Bacon and Eggs.  Nothing fancy, but everything was good.  My friend had the Croque Madame and was extremely satisfied even though she put only a minor dent in the mountain of "frites" served wit it.  Her husband ordered the special which was a homemade sausage (great) served with roasted vegetables and poached eggs (way underdone).  My waffle with bananas was served last.  Tasted good but was not fresh.  It was not even warm.

The waiter never checked on the table.

I will definitely go back.  Lots of potential.
