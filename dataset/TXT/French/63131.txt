SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA Excellent place!  And as several reviewers have mentioned very chic (but without breaking the bank).  This place is located across from the law school.  I'm jealous of all the law professors that have this walking distance from them!  The outdoor patio is especially enticing this time of year and that is where we went!  

I had a chicken pizza for lunch and it was quite tasty (albeit a tad oily). Altogether, the elegant chic ambiance of the place is what elevates the entire dinning experience. I felt like I was at a chi-chi restaurant in NYC or some large European city.

*One weird thing: there's no bread basket at the table, rather, waiters hover around and intermittently place bread on your plate with thongs.  WHY?  This is rather distracting and unnecessary in my opinion.
