hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA Had a craving for a croissant filled with meat, cheese, and egg while in Vegas. This place came on the top of the Yelp recommendation page. Neat little place tucked in a corner of a strip mall made of predominantly offices. Seats inside are kinda limited, but there are plenty of tables outside. Tried the ham and cheese croissant with a cup of cappuccino - both came out good! I don't think I could stay long in this place and not getting fat - I was about to buy every kind of baked goods they just pulled out from the oven all the time I was there.
