Food wise there were many crepes to choose from, both savoury and sweet. The crepes were finely made, thin, and light. I must say though, that the filling tasted kind of bland and did not melt well with the rest of the crepe; I had the spinach, ham and cheese crepe with a coffee, costing around $10. 
Still an overall positive experience though, with great service and atmosphere and very reasonably priced. I would go back to try a breakfast crepe, for the next time I'm in town.
