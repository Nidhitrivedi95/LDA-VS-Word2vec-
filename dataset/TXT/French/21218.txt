B56AYe5GNuavMDtwFsXqzA I've recently fell in love with French Cuisine and had the chance to endure great flavors from a cozy, cottage-like, French restaurant in the heart of downtown Scottsdale, Arizona.

I had made rezzies at Petite Maison via Open Table on Yelp. Parking is on the street or their nearby parking lot. As we walked up to the hostess' table, she was able to show us to our seats. Although the restaurant offers outdoor patio dining, we opted to dine inside to experience dining in this cute, kitschy restaurant.

*ESCARGOT ($11 for 6 pieces, **3.5 STARS**)
I was expecting to shell out the escargot from it's shell! But actually, the escargot was already pulled from it's casing and baked within an individual baking dish full of melted butter and seasonings. The dish was served piping hot (especially the plate itself) along with two slices of warm, toasted baguette. The escargot was delightful, rich and tender. The warm buttery sauce it was baked in, encapsulated every crevice and gave a lot of oomph to the escargot itself. Definitely a dish worth trying! I kinda wish though I had the fun of shelling out the escargot from it's shell, but at the same time I'm kinda glad I didn't have to get down and dirty for it! 

*FOIE GRAS ($18, **4 STARS**)
Was OMG! Mouth-watering, delicious and worth every penny! For those of you who are unfamiliar with foie, it's duck liver fat. The French would feed the ducks corn (in this case we knew the ducks were free-range and came from a decent place). The foie gras was seared and tasted like it was a piece of steak! As you cut into a piece of the seared foie, you got a piece of fat, which glistened within the light. Add a piece of the paired cranberry chutney, cider glaze and savory donut, this dish was mesmerizing! I do concur that it's worth ordering as this dish is what the restaurant is known for! GET 'EM!!!! 

*BOULLIABAISE ($33, **3 STARS**)
A saffron base sauce was made with fresh mussels, clams, shrimp, scallops and halibut. The seafood was cooked quite well and everything was tender. The seafood was fresh! The base of the sauce was simple and not too salty. Not the best nor the worst, but pretty decent in my humble opinion.

*POISSON ($28, **1 STAR**)
A seared piece of halibut was cooked well. I liked that there was a nice "sear" within the fish and it was light and flaky. The only downfall to this dish is that the lobster risotto was not executed correctly. First and foremost, the risotto was so soupy that it wasn't thick in consistency as risotto should be. In addition, after one bite of the risotto, it was quite grainy - as if the rice was not yet cooked!!!!! After flagging down our waitress, she apologized for the mistake and was embarrassed for such a thing happening. 

The dish was sent back to the kitchen to be corrected. After several minutes, the risotto was served. Not only did it taste slightly better, BUT it was still grainy because the risotto was not cooked well..... AND it was still soupy! Unfortunately, it was the risotto that had made the halibut a lackluster as it was not paired well together. I didn't want to embarrass the waitress again and send back the dish, but accepted it as what it was. 

Service (**5 STARS**) was phenomenal from our waitress. I liked the fact that she shared recommendations of what to devour since it was our first time visiting the restaurant. She even shared a few corny jokes, which made our evening fun despite the risotto fail. She apologized sincerely for the mistake and was happily to correct the error. 

Overall, Petite Maison is a decent French restaurant in Scottsdale, Arizona. But I've had better French food in Portland, that this place doesn't really compare! If I were to come back to Petite Maison, I would probably only order the FOIS GRAS again. I had heard their dessert is good as well. Maybe my taste buds are spoiled by Portlandia, BUT for what it's worth, Petite Maison is A-OK in my book!
