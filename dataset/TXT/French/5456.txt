Not really a big fan to dine with other tourists in Old Montreal during the Grand Prix weekend, I found this place on a side street near Saint Laurent and it did not disappoint. The French onion soup was perfect -  not too cheesy but perfect you could taste the great combination of cheese and onion it was that good. I ordered the duck confit as my entree it was cooked perfectly. The duck was very juicy and the meat was silky smooth. Pairing the food with a glass of Kronenbourg was surely a winner. I finished off with a creme burlee (hazelnut) and a cup of cappuccino. Unfortunately I have to deduct a star here for very slow service near the end of my meal. I had to wait for a long time for my cappuccino and then my bill but if I am back in town, I would love to visit again.
