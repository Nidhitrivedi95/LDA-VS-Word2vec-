-uGMZNvGu7gsrOaUMAmf_A Visiting from Los Angeles. We stayed in Quebec City and Montreal for a little over a week, and actively searched for the best croissant. Crazy,  I know. But, hey... why not. 

We stopped here for a quick bite, not thinking it was going to be great. Wow, I was wrong. 

The BEST croissant I've ever had. Period. Chocolate and hazelnut heaven. Their quiche is very,  very good,  as well.  

Coffee is Illy, I believe. Can't go wrong there. Service excellent. 

Highly recommend!!
