_T7f2wUgNlJqxsR-cR89SQ I should have written a review sooner. I have been to Scaramouche many times (note there is a difference between the restaurant and pasta bar. I have been to both, but am reviewing the restaurant. The food and service have always been great. 

The location is very nice because you overlook the city when you are eating. So, make sure to get a seat next to the window.

The food has always been excellent. For appetizers, the last time I ordered the grilled which octopus is done perfectly. For the main course, I either get the lamb (one of the best I have had) or scallops. Dessert, I am not a dessert person, but their coconut creme pie with white chocolate shavings is good. The dishes come out at a good pace.

There is an extensive wine list and the sommelier is always there to help. He doesn't always recommend the most expensive wine - he just recommends what is good.

In terms of service, the staff are always attentive. Most importantly, wine glass is always full.
