WOj8nPos3R9IIf0Pyttd8g We went for Saturday brunch and it was so delicious! I just had to get the burger with fried green tomato and piminto cheese served with pomme frites (yum) and my friend took the server's recommendation and had the French Toast (declared it was the best she ever had!). The portions were generous and we each had a glass of wine (generous pour). Service was attentive without being bothersome and I love the cosy feel of the space. We are going back next weekend and bringing some friends!
