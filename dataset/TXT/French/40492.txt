KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA Always love coming here for dinner with the family.  The salmon was pretty good but the pork chop I had during a previous visit is probably my favorite. The wife had steak frites and loved them. What really keeps us coming back, though, is the charcuterie plate, the excellent service (ask for Marty), and the great wine selection. We always bring a few bottles home with us for in between visits. Be sure to check this place out!
