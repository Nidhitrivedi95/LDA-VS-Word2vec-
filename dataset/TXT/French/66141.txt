ufwkkMd9yr9cFU1R5ONArg My first morning in Toronto started with a delicious breakfast here. Kris U said he knew just the place to take me. Of course, he nailed it. 

This is my kind of spot. It almost felt kind of divey. Small space, casual, crazy good food, friendly staff. We both ordered the Mexican benedict. For my side, I went half salad, half potatoes. It sounded kind of weird when my server suggested it, but I'm glad she did. Hungry for more than two benedicts? They have an option for a third benny. Genius. 

I only have one problem with this place, what do I do now when I'm craving their Mexican bennies and coffee? Kris U, mail me benedicts and breakfast burritos ASAP.
