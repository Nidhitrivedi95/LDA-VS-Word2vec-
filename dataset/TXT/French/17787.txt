9ot8oInkYZTt6wkkGe__vQ We went here to celebrate my husband's birthday and were not disappointed.  The price is high, but the quality is unmatched.  I got the steak tartare for my appetizer and it was really good and a decent amount of food.  It came with several crustini and various accompaniments such as pickles and radish.  For my main I ordered off the tasting menu to get the canard a l'orange which came with roasted sun chokes and grilled endive.  The duck was delicious, cooked to a nice rare and the orange sauce was a perfect accent.  For dessert we got the cheese tray with 5 different cheeses, one Canadian and four French.  It came with some delicious quince jam, a block of honeycomb, and lots of crispy "feuilles" to eat with it.  All in all it was a really great meal.  After we were finished, they brought out a "Happy Birthday" plate for my husband with some cream puff and truffles on it which was a nice addition.  

This is the third time we have been to this restaurant and I would definitely go back again.
