We arrived at Montreal and I made a reservation because we are a party of six (kids 8, 10 and 13 and three adults). We stayed at the Westin and walked the 25 minute walk to the restaurant. It was very quiet at 5:30 when we arrived, but the restaurant was full by the time we left at 8 PM. Our kids were certainly underdressed, but but nobody made an issue of it. I would definitely try to look at least organized if not nice.

Food was amazing. We had soup of the day, cheese plate and escargot as an appetizer. As a family we enjoyed the lamb, the duck confit, the hanger steak and the pasta (can't remember dish name).  Everything was delicious! Our waiter was sweet as well.  Definitely would return!
