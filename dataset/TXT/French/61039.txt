SFnrHuVFSNiondFVUBLJZQ What's not to love about this place... yummy savory crepes and cafe au lait. We liked the crepes so much we came back twice during our trip. I love the egg, swiss cheese and avocado crepe. 

The restaurant looks small with limited seating until you walk upstairs to go to the washroom and discover an extensive upper dining room enough to seat 50.
