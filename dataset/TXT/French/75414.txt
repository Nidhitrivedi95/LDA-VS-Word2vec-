Ycp3Agr7dt71TZkeKV7jng I stopped  in randomly since it was on the walk back to my hostel. Looked pretty nice, so why not?

I asked if they served iced coffee since I didn't see it on the menu anywhere. The cashier said "We do iced Americanos", which was fine by me, it's actually preferred. What was not fine was the amount of condescension in her voice and on her face as she said it. If I wanted crappy customer service, I'd go to Starbucks.

Look, I get that iced coffee isn't a favorite of baristas or coffee afficianados of any sort. They're not my favorite either, but they're refreshing on a hot day, moreso than my usual order of an Americano and iced tea isn't really my thing. But regardless of what's being ordered, you should give good customer service. It's not like I was holding up a line or anything, I was the only one waiting to be served.

I would take my money elsewhere.
