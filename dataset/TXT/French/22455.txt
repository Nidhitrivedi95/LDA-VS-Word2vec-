BSmqxPbQglQwP2R56OqOag This used to be one of my favorite places. Food is great, atmosphere is wonderful. I went last week for happy hour and it was packed as usual. They don't allow carry out happy hour pricing, so I decided to stand and eat as I was in a hurry anyways. I went to pay and they wanted to charge me over double the pricing stated in the happy hour pricing. I simply asked the bartender to update the price and after talking to his co worker mentioned that the item was not on happy hour after I was half way through my salad.
