50-xiTYmE6NERi-yJ6NvHw Dropped in to have a quick bite before the So You Think You Can Dance show across the street at happening at 7:30 in the evening. We arrived at around 6pm, and got seated at the bar as everything else was either occupied or reserved. Our orders went in at 6:11pm according to the receipt. 

We ordered a dozen of the $1 oysters (we came here just for this), 2 mushroom soups and a goat cheese salad. The soups arrived at 6:40, about half an hour after we ordered. At about 7 the gentleman next to us asked the bartender to check on his order; he had been waiting for an hour. The lady next to us mentioned that her oysters took an hour to arrive also.  Finally our salad came at 7:05, and it wasn't that good.  At about 7:10 we decided to mention to the bartender that we had a show to catch, and she started to get the bill until I reminded her that our oysters hadn't arrived yet. She apologized profusely and went to the kitchen to check for us.  Five minutes later the oysters came and I rushed to gulp them down and pay the bill. Then I realized I only got 10 of the dozen that I ordered, and had to get the bill adjusted. 

I don't fault the bartender too much as it was the kitchen's fault, but the speed of service was atrocious and the food was overpriced for what you get ($10 for a soup and $15 for a tiny salad with no meat), aside from the oysters.  If I hadn't told to server we had a time constraint who knows how much longer we would have had to wait?
