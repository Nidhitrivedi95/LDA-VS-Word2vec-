Dcj69NZJnbJhK-YHP_nULA The perfect Thursday night out. Friendly local bar and restaurant. The frites are amazing and so is most of the menu. Spectacular and extensive beer list too. Double sided bar area opening into more seating. They have a record box for listening to old vinyl too. Good service and a fun staff! Great for small groups or a date night.
