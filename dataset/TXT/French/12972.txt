4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw It was my birthday and at the advice of his brother who had been in Vegas the weekend before us, my husband decided we should have dinner at Mon Ami...and I am SO glad we did..We both had the filet mignon merlot and I am still remembering the taste now two days later...lol...It was SO good and the red wine reduction was perfect. Next time we're planning on trying their breakfast/brunch
