D7CnTsm8SCmbQghz1ioPdw I enjoyed the service very much. The drinks were ok and the lobster cavatelli was on point. Truly enjoyed that. My kids also had the fettuccine and thoroughly enjoyed that as well. My biggest complaint was the venison for 2 was portioned for 1. Totally overpriced for what that was and I think it was 140 cad for that alone. It was alright.

Just don't get that. It's not worth it.
