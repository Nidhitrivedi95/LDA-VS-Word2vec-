oZHbPhIj01_31jqD053a_Q The surprises kept coming!  I was excited about this meal but after a few days of seeing the sites around Montreal we considered doing something more casual for the night. After Europea, we were glad that we went with our reservation!  

The number of appetizers treat type items that they bring, one after the other, is truly incredible. Truffle oil popcorn, homemade jerky on a clothesline, lobster cappuccino, smoke salmon displayed in a wooden box, on and on. The entrees were very good but the experience was out of this world!

Best surprise came at the end when the cotton candy tree, marshmallows, chocolate truffle, and meringue to-go all arrived. 

You pay a lot but you are paying for entertainment as well as your meal. I am cheap/frugal but this was a unique experience worth every Penney.
