Christopher's Restaurant has elevated our expectations of fine dining to a level that is dangerously high. 

We started with cocktails and first courses: the sweetbread and an order of escargot. It was our first time eating either, and I'm definitely a fan of both. I also noticed we seemed to be the only ones eating our bread, and whether that's more we were just eating our way through whatever they brought out or other patrons were carb conscious, I'll never know. For our entrees, Robert order the fillet mignon and I ordered the duck; we ordered a side of gnocchi. Sweet baby Jesus! Were these the most flavorful, succulent and outrageously orgasmic cuts of meat God ever saw fit to be served? I'm thinking so, because chewing was simply a customary task and an excuse to keep the meat in contact with our taste buds that much longer. And the gnocchi, mary, was splendid and deserving of a Nobel Peace Prize. 

The sheer richness of each course was overwhelming. So much so, that I couldn't finish my duck. But unlike that over-filled feeling one gets when getting stuffed, this was a pleasant sensation of being fulfilled. 

I can't wait to go back, this time on a Thursday because I want to try their rabbit and see how good it is. In the meantime, I'm going to be studying French and dining etiquette so I at least appear to be refined.
