P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ We experienced a stunning dinner experience, from the ambiance, fabulous and innovative food preparation, to the exquisite service.  We had their combination Signature menu with caviar tasting added.  Included dishes were  "Colors of Caviar," Heirloom Tomatoes Salad and Tartare, miniature hamburger on a miniature sesame bun (maybe a total of 3/4 of an inch across!) that had incredible flavor;   Frozen Vinaigrette; Red Mullet, Chanterelles and Natural Jus; Foie-Gras "Bitter Infusion"; Artichoke and Black Truffle Soup,Toasted Mushroom Brioche, and Black Truffle Butter (Guy Savoys signature dish); American Prime Beef Tenderloin, Oxtail Pommes Boulangère (sooo sweet and tender) and Baby Heirloom Carrots; and Fine Cheeses,  Quince and Apple, Chocolate Fondant, Crunchy Praline and Chicory Cream.  It also included an amazing assortment of breads.  And champagne of course.

Needless to say we were stuffed.  Everything was so good and beautifully plated.  Service was attentive but non-hovering, and very congenial.  Could not have been better.
