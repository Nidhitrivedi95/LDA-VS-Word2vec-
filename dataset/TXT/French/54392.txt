rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw This is a really nice restaurant in the Aria.  You have to take the escalators upstairs from the casino to find it.  I was a little embarrassed waking in here with my shorts, but they didn't blink.  I guess I'm in Vegas.  Meanwhile, our waiter with the fake french accent and classy snobbish personality greeted us.  He made us aware of the specials, which I'm glad since we ordered two different ones.  The meal was pretty good too.  The price was high which is expected in a classy type joint.  I just think it was memorable.
