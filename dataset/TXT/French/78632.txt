ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug Since Mon Ami Gabi had a huge line, the boyfriend dragged me away to another restaurant. (My foodie stomach was in tears! :[ I wanted to wait!!)

We found Le Cafe Ille Saint Louis. There were few diners in the restaurant.

The ambience was ... hrm. I'm at a loss for words. We opted to dine outside. The interior was too dreary and lonesome. Outside consisted of small tables underneath a faux Parisian sky, surrounded by casino go-ers. A small gate separated us from the hordes of casino-folks.

The service needs improvement. Our waiter was impatient. He tried to be polite (point! thank you!) but his mannerisms implored discomfort. 

The food failed to be spectacular. There were two special dinner options, and we each got one. Variety to taste everything, right? My chicken was a dry and boyfriend's salmon could have used a bit more flavor. We cook similar dishes at home, and uhmm.. the quality of our homemade dishes trump Le Cafe Ile Saint Louis' offerings. 

Overall, the experience wasn't terrible. But it wasn't quite the best. Vegas has better options.
