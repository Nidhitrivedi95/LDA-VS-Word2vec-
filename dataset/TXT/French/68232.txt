vg55SAkrEmuHpWfIMtJjBQ Perfectly prepared American/French Bistro fare. Every dish I've had has been executed perfectly, with the highest quality ingredients. Due to the whole pregnancy thing there were a couple things I can't eat. I wanted to try the whole roasted fish, which came with an aioli (raw eggs) and the chef graciously substituted a tomato sauce that was delicious-I can't imagine the aioli was any better! The roasted chicken is always spot on, with flavorful pan juices, crispy skin, and juicy meat.  Probably one of my favorite things I ever had were these Pork Rilletes, with a plum-rhubarb ketchup (tasted sort of like a BBQ sauce)- it was BBQ pulled pork elevated to a whole new level. The desserts are delicious as well. I LOVE their chocolate cake- and I do not have a sweet tooth! All in all, their ingredients are of the highest quality, their food is cooked and seasoned to perfection, and I've never had anything that wasn't delicious. It's only cons: it's TINY and can be hard to get a seat, 2) because they change their menu daily and get everything in fresh- they can run out of a particular dish (or dishes) even early in the evening.
