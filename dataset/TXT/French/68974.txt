VwZhwflLnTq19aAeFLJHCQ Awesome sauce!!! Must I say
We are originally from California but I got to say that Bernards has the best Bistro.
I really wanted the MY WAY SPECIAL seabass but they were out and only because its that delicious. So I ordered the Scollops and crunchy frog legs and was the Bomb....
Thanks Gerber your awesome as well. 
Great service!!!
 Yes, I will be returning...
