rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Located in the Venetian hotel - this restaurant was the best I've experienced so far on the strip.  While service was a bit off this night it was still great.

Our table was comprised of 5 people all of which were professional foodies.  No watching the Food Channel does not make most of you on here a foodie.  We work in the hotel food and beverage business.  We do know what we are doing.

The French onion soup was outstanding.  Not salty with just the right balance of stock, broth and cheese.  

Most of us had steaks.  I had the Steak Bouchon - NY Strip cooked perfectly.  The price was $45 but appropriate for a French dining experience.  It included Yukon Gold potatoes and Broccolini.  I am unsure if the steaks were USDA Prime.  It was not listed on the menu so I will have to assume USDA Choice.  

We did not experience dessert, but the after dinner coffee was awesome.  I had decaf due to the hour of the evening and it was full of flavor.  

Atmosphere was upscale and well thought out down to how the servers tie the knot on their apron.  I thought the menu as a napkin ring was a great idea!   

Come casual in your nice jeans and a jacket or a suit and tie.
