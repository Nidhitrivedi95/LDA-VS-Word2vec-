OmFXBWLv1DoFelP2-RLqFA Food is great.  Service is a bit slow, as confirmed by a local who was with us. Prices were great for the amount of food we orderd.  Of course this is all based on an American reviewing who hails from the SF bay area where everything is expensive and things are always at a quick pace.   I would return with my significant other whenever I visit Montreal again.
