YUFxSG6idHePsxOmnSHtpQ Wish I could write a review. The menu looked tempting online and I took immediately to the Ham, Egg, and Swiss waffles. There is a location very nearby but I have never been. So I called for takeout breakfast. After the hostess answered the phone I was put on hold for 8 minutes before I finally hung up. Nice try but I won't bother with Mimi's again.
