SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ As a highly recommended place, we decided to have our first visit. They assigned us a very nice table and a great server, very attentive and always smiling. My wife had Kale salad and portobello entree. I had clam chowder and pork chop. Food was really delicious and portions  were generous enough so no space for dessert. Next time in Phoenix, will certainly try to dine here.
