3M7MWfMh5RSoASV23-6hEw Mrs. Amigos is an unpretentious eatery that offers cafe fare, brunch, and French dining options.  The atmosphere presents a family-friendly room and the clientele (at least when I went in) consisted of retirees and families of East Asian origin.  The decor seems to reflect the clientele well (or perhaps it's the clientele that reflects the decor?); it's a unique combination of French bistro with children's drawings adorning the glass window and there are even a few Asian touches. 

My partner and I tried the brunch items, which tasted exactly like my mom's!  The presentation was good, however, some of the items were... slightly scorched.  They weren't so burnt that I couldn't eat them, but it did look a little odd on my plate, and hey, I wouldn't dare criticize mom's food for fear of punishment!  And just like mom, the server (could it have been THE Mrs. Amigos?) had a slight tone of disapproval when we couldn't finish our plates.  I didn't really like having to feel guilty for leaving a small piece of food on my plate (almost reminded me of Spirite Lounge)... but whatever...

All in all, I wouldn't come back here for breakfast, but I might come back for lunch or supper since the plates looked quite good.
