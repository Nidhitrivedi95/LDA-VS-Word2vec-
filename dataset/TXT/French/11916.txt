4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw On a recent 2-night trip to Vegas, we actually ate here twice, once for breakfast and once for dinner.

I have to say, this is one of my favorite restaurants anywhere, not just counting Vegas. The deck is worth the wait to watch the fountains, but if you want to enjoy it without the wait, go at breakfast. The interior is just as wonderful at night, so don't feel too disappointed if you sit inside.

I do feel that their menu has gotten a little less adventurous since I went for the first time 6 or 7 years ago. But it is still excellent, and surprisingly reasonably priced, given it's premier location.

Just a great experience all around.
