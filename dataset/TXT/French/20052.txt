aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw I bought a box of macarons ($17.50) and liked the soft pumpkin flavor.  I didn't love the chocolate pudding because I expected more of a mousse-like consistency instead of feeling fine sugar crystals on my tongue.  At $3.50, it was probably the cheapest item I bought there.  I don't think I can afford to bring back cookies or jam as a souvenir.  I like the packaging and silverware.  

I recommend the apple croissant, chocolate, and lemon tarts.  I still have an apple tart and chocolate almond croissant left over.  The oatmeal is very plain without milk.  A woman waiting saw me pick it up at the drink counter and said, "good for you!".  The beignets are filled with chocolate or raspberry.  

The orange juice seems expensive but I was tempted to buy the carafe.  Their hot chocolate is satisfying for a light breakfast.  Tomato foccacia is okay.  Its topped with feta over olive oil or pesto.  When I asked the clerk for recommendations of soft bread for someone with a cough, he couldn't give me any tips.
