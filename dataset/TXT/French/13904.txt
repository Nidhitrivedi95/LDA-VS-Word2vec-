50-xiTYmE6NERi-yJ6NvHw Biff's Bistro is nice and pricey for dinner.

We went for Winterlicious Dinner and it was just okay.  But the service was excellent that I would probably go back again.  Plus, I reallly want to try their oysters!

The atmosphere is pretty nice, but our table for two was too close to the table for two behind us.  I don't think it's meant for two women with winter coats to be sitting back to back without hitting each.  We ended up pulling our table over since there was no other table on one side of us.

Ther server was cute! (Too bad neither my friend nor I am single!  I'm just kidding... kinda..) The service was very good from the very start.  The host greeted us promptly and we were seated very quickly even without reservations.  We ended up taking our time after our meal to eat our desserts and then even after that we stayed to chat a while longer.  They never tried to kick us out (thank goodness it wasn't a busy night) and they still served us water time and time again.

The food was okay, but I thought it was a little on the pricey side even with the Winterlicious menu pricing.  The breat there is very good!  We ended up getting 2 more refills.  The portion size of the appetizer is good, but I found the portion size of the entrée was a little small.  The dessert was delicious and a good size.

All in all it was a good night out.
