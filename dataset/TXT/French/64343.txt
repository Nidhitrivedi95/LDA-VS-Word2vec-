tCSlpwJQ4CZsUEMZeH2SFg Good experience on my first visit to Cafe Monte. I love the casual yet classy atmosphere and the warm and welcoming feel you get inside. The service here was spot on. My server was very attentive, and receptive. For dinner I had the lobster and crab crepes with a side of pommes frites. The crepe entree is very filling and full of good flavors. The pommes frites are thin and crispy and nothing less than amazing. I'll definitely return again soon.
