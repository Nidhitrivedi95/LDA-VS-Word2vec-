XcWlBj5oQgzKhR7Cxovj3w Good service. I get the feeling from the other reviews that their lunch and dinner might be good. Their breakfast was not good, and was overpriced even for an airport. My friend's French Toast was extremely dry, and my bacon and eggs was a small portion. Another friend got a Bloody Mary that he enjoyed, until he got the bill. The bartender/server was friendly and attentive.
Would not recommend for breakfast.
