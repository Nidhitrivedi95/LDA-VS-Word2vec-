SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ We visited this place last spring based on the reviews read. I thought I sent this review in not long after our visit,  but Yelp gave me a reminder to finish the review.

 Pros: Quiet adult atmosphere. 

Cons: We had salmon with vegetables. Since I was possibly allergic to the puree, I was suppose to get more vegetables instead, but that didnt happen. Food was small portion and not worth the cost. Order was not correct. We were seated under a large umbrella with a table candle light that would not stay lit. As the sun set we could barely see our food. Wait Staff not attentive so we could have our candle table light lit to see our food.

Also be prepare to pay for parking as its located in busy area.

Overall, this place is not worth the money spent.
