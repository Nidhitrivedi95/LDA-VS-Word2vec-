ysJo5Jdo29XOBCnKrbUKWg I've had some really delicious meals here, and their holiday decorations are just lovely.  I woudn't particularly recommend sitting in the tented back patio in the winter if you can avoid, but they do try their best with the space heaters, and they would totally do the trick if they didn't have people coming in and out of the back door.

Overall, the setting is a step up from Crepes Parisiennes on Filbert, but that's what you're paying for, the setting, the service and a fuller menu.  Their crepes are not better and are overpriced in comparison to the aforementioned place, but their Plats Principaux are far from flavorless and owners really seemed to make an effort to work the room, at least whenever I've been there.  If you're a seafood lover like moi, try the Crevettes Provencales, the last time I had it I could not get over how they cooked the shrimp to perfection, a task not often completed around these parts. Just don't bother with the crepes here and it's a really great menu.
