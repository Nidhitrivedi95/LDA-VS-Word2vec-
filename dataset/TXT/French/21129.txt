b3wgQ6CccBO8fgvlbS0M1Q OK, after the Thai place at that location closed I began to wonder what will open in its place? At some point this was also some kind of Mediterranean restaurant, but never went there. After almost two months of watching people come in and out of that place, they were ready for business. I was a little hesitant at first, but I walked in for lunch and I really liked what I had, but, I noticed that they a pastry display and began to wonder what kind they had. So, about three weeks after my initial visit I walked in and went straight to the pastry display. I purchased a couple of croissants and two of what the owner described as King's Torte (an Epiphany staple). Although it set me back almost $20.00, I must say it was worth every penny. I haven't returned for lunch, but I make at least one stop a week to get my sweet fix. You have to try it one day.
