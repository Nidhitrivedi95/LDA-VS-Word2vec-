Colette's is a one of a kind experience, the food is incredible, literally anything on that menu will taste full of flavour and aroma. In the mornings they come around with a cart and offer grapefruit mimosas and the original orange juice mimosas. The staff is very accommodating and friendly, I love coming here for breakfast and lunch.
