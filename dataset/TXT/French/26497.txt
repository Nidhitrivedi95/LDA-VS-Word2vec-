D7Wv_B7GBbrx-EDfgxDwRA I had the ribs with shrimp with the cheddar cheese and mashed potato, thats really gigantic. As for the ribs, they taste really great. The bbq sauce for the ribs was magical. I had tasted the goat cheese from my friends plate, boy it just melts in your mouth. The place was ideal for a date night and with groups too.
