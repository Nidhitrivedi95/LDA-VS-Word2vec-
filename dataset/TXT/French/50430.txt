ovtlrcsVRlgZZQUlHs_ovw Such a basic restaurant that pretends to be better than it is. It was my sisters 17th birthday tonight (no idea why she picked this place) but I was looking forward to it anyway. We show up only to find its CLOSED, ALTHOUGH we had a reservation booked for 10 people!!! They didn't even have the respect to give us a call. This lack of service is typically reserved for Applebees or Chilis, I will never be taking my family here again.
