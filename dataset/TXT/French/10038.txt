4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw One of my go-to spots when I'm in Vegas.  Not too fancy, good food, nice outdoor patio right across from the Bellagio fountains.  The seafood crepes are awesome.  They technically are not on the menu for some reason, but they'll still make them for you if you ask.  My only complaint to the staff would be: Please turn off your gas-lit lights when it's 100 degrees outside and sunny.  I literally thought my face was going to melt into my delicious beer.  But I still love you.
