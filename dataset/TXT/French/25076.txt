Those are the things that all these reviews seem to cover so I will too.

The food: good, not mind-boggling, and certainly not proof of the existence of God. 
I had the rustic pasta which was salty, but satisfying. Then the veal ribeye which was like fatty pork. The bread was nice but not great. The wines by the glass were pretty good but a severely limited selection.

The service: very good. Perhaps this is the best thing about the restaurant. Very attentive and gentle. The waiter, busboys, sommelier and manager were all invested in making the experience a good one. As Lawrence Welk said: Thank you boys.

The room: cold and charmless...like eating in the terminal at La Guardia...except for the hanging glass bubbles which made me feel like I was in a glass of club soda.

The view: very nice, but because the restaurant is kind of on the side, the view from the MIx bar is better. As well, the tables are too close together so that it feels like everyone around you can listen to your conversation. No intimacy at Mix.

The biggest problem with Mix is that the food is way too expensive. 
I have one piece of advice, from someone who virtually eats out every night of the week...you will go out of business if you don't modify your price structure.
Read the business section of any newspaper: prices that were accceptable in 2004 are irresponsible and verging on offensive in 2009.
