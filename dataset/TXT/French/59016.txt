rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w I reviewed Le Cirque on October 23, 2011. Since then I have returned two more times. Who knows if my experiences at Le Cirque were going to be different.  Well, they were even better!!! Since dining at Le Cirque in October, I have also dined twice at what many people consider the greatest restaurant in the USA---Alinea.  I would rather dine at Le Cirque than Alinea. The service at Le Cirque is more friendly and seemed less rehearsed. The food that Chef Gregory creates is more sophisticated and flavorful. Grant(ed), the dining experience at Alinea is absolutely wonderful and it is almost like attending a theater performance. And there is nothing quite like having a meal at Alinea. As far as the food goes, I just prefer Le Cirque and Chef Gregory. During my dinner last Friday night, I especially loved the Santa Barbara sea urchin "ice cream", the bucatini timbale, and also the deconstructed bouillabaisse.
