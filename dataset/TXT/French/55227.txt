rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Great salmon dish with a seafood type broth. Trout comes pan seared with head still on so be warned! Duck confit was just okay. Croquet madame was a hit with the table. Foie gras was hit and miss at our table. Great ambience. Nice outdoor patio. Service can be a bit haughty. Good beer selection. Nice experience, but not sure I'd come back just for the salmon.
