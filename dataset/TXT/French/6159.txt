41vgh9z4OSJfbgOy57qh0Q Seriously good value for money if you eat from the table d'hote menu. 

Service can be a bit hit or miss but I think maybe some teething problems on the few times I have visited. The wine list is keenly priced. 

Always find it a little weird eating at a place in a hotel where you have to walk through the lobby. But overall 5 stars as it doesn't detract from the technically accomplished cooking at this price point. 

I like how you can get a table on a friday night. This is classic french bistro fare down right.
