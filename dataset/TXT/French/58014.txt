This was a highlight of our honeymoon. I was so looking forward to this meal and knew after we got here, nothing would compare. And we were right. 

We were sitting next to a lovely couple who highly recommended the chicken and waffles and what a recommendation it was. 

Let's just say the bread and butter course was the best I've ever had. 

We started with the basket of pastries. We had the raspberry beignets. Full of freshly prepared raspberry jam with a crispy exterior. The chocolate almond croissant was incredible. The pecan sticky bun was topped with so many pecans! But my favorite of all was the cheese pastry. It was a muffin full of mascarpone cheese and it was heavenly. 

For our entrees we split the eggs Benedict which was good but I could have done without. The chicken and waffles was the star of the show. Bacon cheddar waffles with perfectly roasted chicken with mushroom bacon gravy poured on top. Like, are you kidding?! It was perfect. The side of fries and bacon were also exceptional. 

We mentioned that we were on our honeymoon and were sent a delicious creme brulee on the house that was, of course, perfect. 

Everything was amazing. Between service, food, and value this place is not to be missed.
