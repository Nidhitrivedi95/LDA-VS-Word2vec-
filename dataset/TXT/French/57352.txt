rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A This restaurant has been on my list whether I'm in Vegas or Napa. However, it kind of fell short to my high expectations considering it's Thomas Keller's establishment. Everyone raves about how good it is and it didn't hit the mark. Albeit, I did come during brunch and maybe it's not as good as their other items on their lunch or dinner menu. As expected, the wait is always going to be long but I was pleasantly surprised that I got in after 30 minutes of waiting. My friend and I ordered their specials for the day which was clams steamed in a chorizo broth, eggs benedict, and the fresh and smoked salmon rillette. From those three items, the smoked salmon rillette was my favorite but everything else tasted really bland. In addition, our food was pretty cold. I most likely will give this restaurant another shot, possibly in Napa next time.
