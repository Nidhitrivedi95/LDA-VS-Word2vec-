SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ I know that this place gets rave reviews from ASU faculty, so I took some out-of-town guests for lunch.  I had made reservations online and specifically requested indoor seating.  When we arrived, our table had been prepared outdoors--and, even worse, out in the open, so it was covered in fallout from the trees and speckled with bird poo.  We requested in indoor table and were quickly accommodated.  I'm guessing that some people find bird poo to be 'quaint' or authentic, but I don't.

To summarize: Some of the food is delicious, while some of the food is disappointing.  Club sandwich was delicious, grilled chicken sandwich was dry and flavorless.  The menu reads much more impressively than the food that arrives.

I was also disappointing that it took over an hour to receive our lunch entrees on a Monday afternoon.  One of our five dishes had also been incorrectly prepared (ordered without hot peppers, but they were included), but we didn't have time to get the food corrected, since we had an engagement.

Service seems adequate, at best, but the servers seem fairly apathetic.  Not rude or incompetent, just not attentive.
