rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A My Vegas trip was made complete with my dinner here.  After reading reviews from other websites, I was skeptical of the service I was to receive, as they mentioned the waiters starting off with an introduction of Thomas Keller.  Thankfully my waitress did not start off with that and she was the best the entire evening.  Ordered was the Charcuterie, which is an appetizer plate of different salami's.  The duck confit, which was tasty beyond word.  I had the endive salad and my entree was the roasted lamb.  Dessert was the caramel custard with banana ice cream.  I enjoyed the ice cream more than the custard.  And an after drink of the Absinthe Drip.  The service was exceptional,so don't know if I just got lucky or not, but I was very happy when I left.
