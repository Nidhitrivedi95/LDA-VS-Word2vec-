ZrHU8ZzwZQjTRpB1K_8JTQ Finally made it here for brunch and had the to-die-for gnocchi carbonara. Service was nice but unobtrusive (that's good) with only one observation--server had a disgustingly dirty apron on that looked like it had served through several shifts. When you're seated and all you see of a server is a dirty bib apron it's kind of off-putting, yes? Oh, and the bloody mary was bitter, not zesty. Was looking forward to a good bloody and this was not it. But overall, a nice brunch and will go back.
