0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g Picasso is the epitome of FINE DINING. Everything was just SO CLASSY.

Atmosphere: SO classy. Did you know the place is decorated with REAL PICASSO Paintings??? How fancy is that? Of course since it's fine dining, it has a business casual dress code and it's very quiet and polite in the dining room.

Food: SO GOOD. You get a choice of 2 tasting menus. (different people can get different ones at the same table which I appreciated). We both got the Degustation Menu. SO delicious. The lobster salad and the lamb and the scallops and the giant dessert...omg. SO good. I cannot say it enough. Also, they give you a complimentary potato soup shooter pre-meal. They ALSO give you a complimentary array of petite fours after your meal (so if you don't want to order dessert, that could serve as your dessert nicely). 

Wine: The sommelier they have is one of around 100 Master Sommeliers in the country. He was very good--you can tell he was super knowledgeable about wine and very passionate about it too. Well, he is a master after all.

Service: Everyone was just SO nice. From the host to the waiter to the bread waiter to the water waiter to the sommelier. They were all friendly and professional. 

Bathrooms were beautiful.

Oh and it's good for small and large groups. Big enough dining room to fit many parties.

If you want fine dining at its best in Vegas, this is the place to go. 

To TOP IT OFF: When you leave the restaurant, they give you this Beautiful little box of Fresh baked cinnamon cookies. OMG. WHO DOES THAT!?!?!? This is high class people. (Did you count? that's 3 different COMPLIMENTARY things they give you throughout dinner. That's AMAZING.)

The experience there just made me incredibly happy. =)
