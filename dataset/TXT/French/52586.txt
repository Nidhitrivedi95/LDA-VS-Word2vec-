Q5rybJSXsYpi0Weju8fR5A I always think of Second Cup as a slightly Canadian Starbucks. It's just about the same, except their iced lattes have a bit more of an espresso punch to them.

Nothing special about this location. If there's even a hint of sunshine, the outdoor patio will be packed with singles doing work or reading.
