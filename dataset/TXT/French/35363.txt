Ht-_i0UAq7YDBaqJwcQMdQ Was recommended to my gf and I while staying in Montreal for weekend. Had oysters three ways.  Rock crab. Scallops. For entree split the surf and turf. Wait staff was fun and knowledgeable. Waiter recommended a delicious bottle of white wine. I had Rice pudding with figs for dessert.
The place itself is open and perfectly lit with very comfortable chairs. 
An all-around great dining experience. 
If you are there for just a weekend and want to do something special for dinner with your significant other- this is the place for you.
