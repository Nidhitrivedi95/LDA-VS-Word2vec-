Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA What a great disappointment! We were looking forward to trying the supposedly amazing French touch from Chef Ducasse at Mix, however nothing felt like a Michelin gastronomic restaurant. 
Apart from the view of the Vegas strip, this restaurant is truly a waste of money and time. Especially in Vegas where we have found some true gems. 

1. The service was almost inexistent. Our server was extremely pushy and tried to increase the amount of our bill. However, it was pretty obvious what he was trying to do. When asked what are some of the best recommendations, he stated: "Well, first I would start with a glass of champagne." In my head, I was thinking "Dude, I asked you about the food!" Then, he only recommended the tasting menu ($120 per person), without even mentioning the a la carte options. Apart from these two interactions, the waiter did not come see us at any time. 

2. Being familiar with French gastronomic restaurants and famous chefs (like Joel Robuchon), we were dying to see what Ducasse had in store at Mix. A serious lack of innovation and originality was what we noticed. My husband ate a cod that was not-memorable and I got the lobster curry. My dish cost around $50 and I swear when it arrived it literally looked like it had just been thrown onto a plate with no considerations for the aesthetics of the dish. Curry splashed all over, a mush of overcooked rice and just nothing that excites the eyes. While the lobster was abundant, the dish tasted like a curry dish I would have taken at a regular Thai restaurant (which would cost $10). I'm just glad we didn't try anything else. And those two dishes were supposed to be the top items that display Ducasse's "genius" abilities....

Overall, it might be best for Ducasse to take his name out of this restaurant. My husband and I are huge foodies and we have tried top restaurants in every city we have visited, but this one is definitely not a place we would come back!
