3FlWR_osNPb8dcqLgHebHw Good not Impressive


This breakfast, lunch, and dinner spot is alright.  The decor is very welcoming, with soft booths and well-spaced tables.  The breakfast is far better than the lunch/dinner offerings.  I usually go with the four alarm omelette, which has scallions, jalapenos, jack cheese, and a homemade chiptole sauce all topped with tortilla strips.  Again, it is good not great.

The service is always great, many of the servers have been here a long time and now how to be friendly and efficient.  

Think of Mimi's as an upscale Denny's or IHOP.  It is consistently average, and a good place to come with a group for relaxing brunch. There isn't much that stands out here, just all around solid fare.
