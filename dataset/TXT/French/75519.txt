Ycp3Agr7dt71TZkeKV7jng I have worked in this neighbourhood for 5 years now and very early on, I had the pleasure of experiencing Le Gourmand. It actually surprises me that I haven't written a review yet!

The decor reminds me of a French cafe. The menu is written on a chalk board, the tables are intimate (aka small) round wood tables and at the back of the restaurant is pantry where you can purchase goods such as olive oils, pasta and chocolate. 

The reason this review doesn't get more stars is because of their prices. I find them to be astronomical in comparison to what you get. Yesterday I got a large soup, (which isn't all that large) and paid close to $7.00 for it. The average meal is around $12. 

If you need an afternoon pick me up though I do suggest going and getting one of their massive cookies. I dare you to try and eat the whole thing. they are pretty big and pretty fantastic. That with a latte, it will fuel you to get thru the rest of the day.
