T4g4k2OhCTsiqcP-ZXElHQ I don't think I've ever had a croque monsieur before eating a Jules Bistro, or maybe years ago in Paris, but it wasn't stand out, so I've never ventured to try one again. But the croque monsieur here is OUTSTANDING!!! Hands down the best sandwich I've ever had (if I may call this open faced dish a sandwich). I have been craving ever since, and will definitely be back for another!
