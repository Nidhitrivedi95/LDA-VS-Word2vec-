O66Zy8Y13VBm72ZDhS4fIg This is the second time we've been here for a weekend getaway and it was fantastic again. This time we sat on the waterfall side (note: always sit on the waterfall side) and the ambiance was 100% better. The food was fantastic, well presented and satisfying. The serving staff was fun, kind and really helped to make the whole experience worthwhile. Will definitely come back again!
