tCSlpwJQ4CZsUEMZeH2SFg I was very disappointed on Saturday, July 22nd.  We had reservations at 8pm for 5 of us.  Our service was horrible.  I drank 3 glasses of water (mine, my wife's, and my mother-in-law's) and the waitress never refilled our waters or asked if we would like anything else to drink.  We had to ask for another bottle of wine.  
After we finished the appetizers, the gentleman that delivered the food was irritated because plates were never cleared.  They delivered the food and cleared the appetizer plates all at once.  No one ever checked to see if we enjoyed our food or wanted anything more to drink.  At this point, it was 9pm and the restaurant really was not that busy.  Our waitress must have been more concerned about getting off her shift then the service she was giving us.
We have dined her before and loved it.  This was not a good experience.  The food was just okay and with bad service... it does not make us want to return.
