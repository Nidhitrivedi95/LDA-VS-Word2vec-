LQ_gYNs5E10IGFE0NOyD7A I've enjoyed both Brunch and Dinner at The Upton and have been blown away each time. 

Having Brunch on the patio is a great way to spend your Sunday afternoon. From lovely patio to the live band playing The Upton knows how to create a wonderful ambiance. Had the Scottish Smoked Salmon and Bloody Mary which both were to die for. Honestly, I've enjoyed everything I have ordered or tasted at The Upton.

Its a must when in Old Town Scottsdale.
