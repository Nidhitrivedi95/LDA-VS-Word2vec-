cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg Went there this weekend and had a fantastic time. It's my 7th or 8th time and I'm always amazed.I also got to take a picture with Martin Picard. wohoo!

I started off with the their house beer which was delicious. 

Then came the foie gras overload...but it rocked my senses.

I highly recommend the 1) Cromesci 2) Duck capaccio 3) duck in can 4) ploc a champlain *** (my favrotie) 5) pecan pie.
