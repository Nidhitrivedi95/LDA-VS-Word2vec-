Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA We came to Vegas for Valentines day. Since we were staying at Thehotel at Mandalay Bay. I decided to try Mix for our Valentines dinner. This is always a special day for us and we have had many great meals over the years. 
Mix does not have great food and the service was slow and poor. We ordered cocktails, it took forever to arrive. Appetizer of tuna tartare was nothing special, you can have a much better one at the Yard House. I had the curry Lobster which was tough and not flavorful. My girl had the Sea bass and again nothing special. 
The waiter was not very good and didn't seemed organized. When we finished our entree the plates just sat there for way too long. Ordered coffee, it took forever! They never asked us if we would like another cocktail.
Very disappointed with the food and the service and we will never return.
 There are many good restaurants in Vegas, I would not recommend Mix to anyone.
