ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug Fuck!!!! That's all I have to say when I walk by this place now. 

I do not know what the heck happened to this place. It used to be pretty decent, but now it's literally taken a nose dive into the toilet. 

The calamari is unbelievably salty. Salty to the point where it felt like you were just eating crunchy sea salt. The french onion soup was not hot and just salty. The Paris burger tasted like your fat uncle's butt crack. It was dry, stale, and the meat just smelled awful. Oh, and guess how it tasted? SALTY. Everything here is so salty... as salty as my attitude right now! 

The service was also terrible. The waiter was a nice man,but he was terribly incompetent at his job. Never came by to check up on us and took forever getting the check to and from us. 

There are better places to eat in Vegas than here. Trust me.
