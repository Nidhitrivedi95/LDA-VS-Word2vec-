 Well... its not as good as i thought it would be. I probably won't be back. 

The fried chicken wasn't my liking it had too many different  flavors  going on and just tasted gross. The waffle also had a weird taste like curry, sweet butter, mixed with some other spices that didn't taste great. 

The burger on the other hand was good, very juicy and perfectly flavored. The fries were meh, they were decent cause of the sauce. 

Service was so-so. Waitress doesn't look very happy. 

Price is: $30 for 2
