q0n4I-zqiI47xispOqc1lA I was a fan of J'eet when I wandered in last year.  I found the coffee here to be exceptional, especially when I told the owner to "surprise me" when he asked what I would like.  I had a spinach French Toast that was exceptional, as savory French Toast was something of a new experience and the Chili was good enough that I ordered a second portion to take with me on the long drive home.  I'm looking forward to making this a regular stop when I visit the Childrens' Hospital across the street.  I spoke at great length with the owner, who was very interested in customer feedback, as was the chef, who told me a lot about how she selected a real artisenal bakery with fresh deliveries.
