HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw 1st review on Yelp as warning. 

Service, very friendly & relatively prompt once server noticed us (10 min at table w/o service on 33% capacity of place).  

Food, seriously mediocre for price. 

Came for Foie Gras, this is breakdown:

Foie gras was mediocre liquidy, beef tongue sent back because it tasted like leather teriyaki, chicken waffles ok, beef tartare decent.  I hate sending food back as it seems so rude, but F that noise. 

Credentials: my LA yelp bookmarks look like a plague of chickenpox & I have eaten extensively throughout Europe (btw, Yelp needs to up game in Euro reviews). 

Going to Secret Pizza for a slice now.
