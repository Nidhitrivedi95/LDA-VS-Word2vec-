FRuuIDOd21pTJHvEGIt1Gg Fun bistro with great food. 

Great service. The place is dim without being overly dark, casual but festive. 

The menu had so many delicious looking choices that if we lived in Montreal we would have to come back to try more! Here's the run down of what we ordered:

Buffala mozzarella salad: YES. A wonderful twist on a caprese. The arugula is in the most wonderful balsamic, the cheese is soft and salty, the proscuitto is prosciutto. 

Vegetable soup: spectacular. Similar to minestrone and just fantastically flavored.

Salmon tartare: really good. The yogurt is a nice compliment. It's a lot so I would recommend getting the appetizer portion.

Salmon: didn't try but my mother really enjoyed 

Warm goat cheese: good, but the only thing that didn't amaze us. Pretty simple goat cheese without too much flavor. Would skip this next time.


Hope you enjoy this as much as we did!
