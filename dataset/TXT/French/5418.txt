I had the warm goat cheese salad as my meal which was delicious. My parents got a lamb dish and a beef dish which was both delicious. We asked for mashed potatoes instead of frieds, but they gave us fries. We mentioned it and they gave us mashed potatoes on top of the fries which was nice. The highlight of the meal was the pineapple flamboise, highly recommended. The vibe was great, the food was amazing, the prices were reasonable. Loved it.
