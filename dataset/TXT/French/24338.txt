cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg A unique experience
This place is unique in many ways. Although I did enjoy my dinner here, I would not go back or recommend it, as today in Montreal there are many other options. (I would recommend the Cabane a Sucre though!)
The food was ok, but lacked focus, was abusing fat, but lacked umami. From the crepes with sirop d'érable, to the duck can, to the many other dishes we had. One interesting thing to note was the the leftovers I took home were much better.
Service was slow, waiters never came and asked if we needed anything, overall this part lacked experience - and it looked the same for everyone around us, perhaps it was a busy night. 
The place is noisy, but I had no problems with that. Decor and vibe were great. 
Wine list is superb. 
Prices are Ok, we ended up with a very high bill as we tried many things. Comparatively speaking, for the amount we spend, we had much better time at other restaurants, within 3k range of this place. 
I've been here 3 times over the last decade to "give it another shot", yet every time I come here, I could write the same review.
