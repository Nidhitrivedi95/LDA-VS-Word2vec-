8ciT6qjI18x9EPtOb-gqYQ Oh this place is so good.

Finally made the Hubs take me during Yelp week - and he too is glad I forced the issue.

At first, I wasn't totally sold on the ambiance of the place, but as the night continued (and the wine flowed) I found myself more and more happy.

We ordered the baked brie & onion tarte as appetizers. DELICIOUS. Ugh, just writing about them makes me want to go back and get more... 

The hubs ordered the filet, and I ordered the salmon. Both were perfection. The sides were also delicious, and the portions were just right. 

For dessert we ordered the four-berry tarte, which too was freaking incredible. I mean seriously, everything they brought out of the kitchen was just fantastic. 

I can't wait to "drag" the hubs back. :) Hopefully SOON.
