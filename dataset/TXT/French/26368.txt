D7CnTsm8SCmbQghz1ioPdw I went to this restaurant on a date night with my husband. As soon as you walk in the entrance candle smells wonderful! The service is outstanding. Our waitress was quick, attentive and overall lovely. We started with 2 bloody ceasers and some oysters. The drinks were delicious and strong! The oysters were so fresh and out of this world! They were also perfectly shucked I might add! My husband ordered a glass of red wine, I forget the name but it was a Cabernet and was really fantastic. I had a marmalade margarita again delicious!!! The main dishes of lobster fettuccini and scallops with a side of roasted potatoes were perfection. For desert we had a chocolate espresso mouse and I was actually so full  I could not finish it! The few bites I had were delicious. I strongly recommend and shall be returning!
