BSmqxPbQglQwP2R56OqOag Local Bistro had been on my list of bookmark's for a while now and I'm glad we finally remembered to check them out. 

Since I'm a points whore we made an Open Table reservation for a weekday lunch knowing fully well we probably didn't need the reservation. We arrived right on time and while the restaurant wasn't packed, it was certainly busy for a Monday at 12:45 PM.

One of the servers greeted us as we entered the restaurant and showed us to a table. Unfortunately he forgot to clear our reservation and now Open Table has us as a "No Show".

Our server came right by and took drink orders and told us about a couple specials and the soup of the day. We both decided on Iced Tea, my partner ordered Chicken Parmesan with a side of spaghetti and I had the Croque Monsieur with fries. The spaghetti was an upsell by the server but really wasn't necessary. The Chicken Parmesan was a double breast pounded, breaded served with a nice side of Arugula Salad. My Sandwich was pretty good, although not a true Croque Monsieur. But wait, I'm getting ahead of myself. 

At this point you may be thinking, why the three-star review? Between the reservation not being cleared, the extremely S-L-O-W service (it took at least 30 minutes for the food to come out of the kitchen) and the cold fries that came with my meal we were somewhat disappointed. Even my partner, who is very forgiving said he would just give them a three star rating. For what we spent for lunch, close to $50 with tax and tip the service and food should have been amazing, not just average.

In the end we may be back. They have a nice wine selection, the atmosphere is really cool and the location is convenient.
