sARavfidmIS878q5BtlyVQ Oh my lord. I bow at the alter of é. Everything was perfect. Beyond perfect. I don't think any meal will ever leave me as satisfied and delighted as é by José Andrés. I may or may not have teared up when it was all over. Tears of joy and sadness. 

The atmosphere is incredible. The room is cozy and whimsical, and the food is presented with the perfection of a well-choreographed show. I won't go over the whole menu, but some highlights were: 

- the most perfect gin and tonic I have ever had - José's signature drink. It has a compressed ice cube in a perfect sphere, which still hadn't melted by the end of our 3 hour dinner, as well as lemon rind, a lime wheel, juniper berries, and the most imaculately measured top shelf gin imaginable. It was amazing. 

- Freeze dried foie gras with a warm, delicious broth below. The foie gras was so rich and creamy, that when served cold, it was like ice cream. We were encouraged to drag it through the warm broth below, which was the most fun, delicious combination ever. 

- Cotton candy empanadas with foie gras and corn nuts - This was our first bite, and we just knew things were going in an awesome direction. Sweet, savory, creamy, crunchy, awesome. 

- Lobster and citrus, I don't remember the details, but the lobster was perfect and tender, and there were little segments of different citrus fruits to pair bites with. 

- Sangria preparations - the first was our édible sangria - whipped to a thick foamy texture, and dotted with encapsulated sangria, freeze dried raspberries, orange zest, spearment, and liquid nitrogen frozen peach puree spheres. So. Much. Fun. 
The second sangria was an encapsulated cava sangria with pear chunks. You let it slide into your mouth, and it would burst instantly, filling your mouth with a full gulp of sangria. Each diner let out a little cry of delight when the bubble burst, because you can't really prepare yourself for a sudden super-gulp of sangria.

- Lamb soue vide - melted in your mouth. 

Really, everything was amazing. I could do the whole list. BUT it's also worth mentioning that I was able to appreciate menu items that I normally despise. I HATE mussels, but ate three of them at é - and disliked them significantly less than I have in the past. (It's a texture thing) I'm also not a big fan of oysters, but their encapsulated presentation was fun. 

The ONLY note that I have was that I was a little confused about the bill. There is a "service charge" of almost $200 for four of us. When the bill was dropped, the server said something about the service charge, but mentioned that we could leave extra for the cooking team. What does that mean exactly? Do you tip again? Does the cooking team get a part of that "service charge?" I was totally confused. I snuck a peak at how much my neighboring diners added and followed suit, but I'm not sure if it was enough. 

But anyways, NOTHING was disappointing. I will absolutely be back. The team does an outstanding job, and I sincerely doubt that I will ever top this dining experience. But that doesn't mean I won't try :)
