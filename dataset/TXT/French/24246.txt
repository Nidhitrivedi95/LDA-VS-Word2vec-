cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg Excellent ambiance. Make a reservation if you want a seat. Sat at the bar where the bartender (Vincent) was extremely friendly. Recommended two great wines to go with the Fois Gras (had it seared). The fois gras sauce was a bit much but still great. Also had the Duck in a Can which was excellent. I'll definitely visit this place again. If you're in the greater Montreal area, I recommend you check out these other places: http://bit.ly/pFQdbi
