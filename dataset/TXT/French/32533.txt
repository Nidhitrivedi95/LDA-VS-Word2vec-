gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg I stopped by while wandering around town on a Wednesday at 530. I wanted to watch the hockey game that was going on and I wanted some bar food. I sat at the bar since I was by myself. This was really good. I had the peppy chili flatbread pizza. It mentions that it's hot but I didn't taste any spiceyness (which is good - I didn't want too spicy) I accompanied it with a beer sangria. Also really good. The service was fast and friendly. 

It's not award winning but it is good bar food and that was all I was looking for!
