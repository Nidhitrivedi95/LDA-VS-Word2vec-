F3rhQVjwggLiN4LsL2kXdQ Saw the review and decided to go here. Glad we made the choice.

We sat in the backyard which was very cozy. 
We ordered Canard en Jarre, lamb shank, salmon tartar and a dish with shrimps, lobsters, mussels etc. All were great.

And don't forget to bring your own wine.

Had a great time here. Highly recommended.
