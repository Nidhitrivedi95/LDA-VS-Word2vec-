 The main hall adjacent to the main entrance has the most spectacular glass domed ceiling.


 The service is very good ! as are the cocktails ;-)


 The atmosphere at the dome during the festive period is lovely, they have beautiful decorations and spiced Christmas scents lingering in every room.


 Lovely relaxing venue.
