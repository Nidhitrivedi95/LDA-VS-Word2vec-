Lunch special of wine, salad and entree is a decent value.  Sauteed chicken breast was excellent.  But it's served with french fries rather than veggies which is really dumb.  Would be 5 stars if veggies instead.  Salad was also excellent as was the service.  Very cool place to bring your special someone.  Very quiet atmosphere.
