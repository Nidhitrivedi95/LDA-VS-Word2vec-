tAj-0ZPUATzLHS0KHzXFBQ Heaven. Just what I wanted on a chilly night in Montreal.

We had the small meal, which came with a stellar spinach and mushroom soup topped with fried onions, followed by the raclette of course. 

The raclette was delicious, as always, with excellent accompaniments, including 3 kinds of cured meats, potatoes, asparagus, broccoli, peppers, and cauliflower. And the standout unique touch--thin slices of apples that seemed to have been soaked in cider. They were so delicious.

The wait staff was attentive and friendly, and the space was warm and quiet, making for a bit of a romantic setting on a cold night with lightly falling snow. 

It is BYOB so we were able to bring a split of a really delicious wine that reminded us that we really need to pay more attention to wine quality on a daily basis. 

No complaints, I'd go back tonight if I were still there.
