q0n4I-zqiI47xispOqc1lA A great little undiscovered place that is frequented by locals and people like us that are always looking to find unusual little places to go to.... And Caffe La Mona  is certainly that! My daughter took me for birthday brunch and even though the menu is not as large as during the week, there were a lot of choices on the menu  Everything was fresh, tastefully prepared and presented. The service was great( not sure where everybody's coming from with complaints of slow or non-existent service, not this day) . For sure we will be returning there!!
