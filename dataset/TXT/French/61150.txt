SFnrHuVFSNiondFVUBLJZQ Had read good reviews about this creperie so decided to stop in for a late night snack/dessert as I was walking through Old Montreal on a recent trip. Ordered the lobster bisque w/cognac which was amazing, and their La Laurentienne crepe (ham, Swiss cheese, asparagus, w/bechamel sauce). Absolutely delicious. 

Restaurant itself was nice and cozy with available upstairs seating. Very affordable. Highly recommended.
