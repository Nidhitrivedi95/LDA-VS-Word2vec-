fFInb4Dl2Ix4iE-VOltbkQ Out of town family members bought us a gift certificate to go to The Nelligans which is super sweet. Unfortunately we couldn't stay at hotel so opted to use the gift card for dinner here. Bad move. First the ambiance is awful. Felt like an old school cigar lounge or library. Which could be cool if done well. But it wasn't. The wait staff were kids who clearly had no clue on the food or menu. Eg we ordered the seafood platter and the server didn't know what oysters were called. When we asked for the region they were from: total blank stare. So we had that and a bottle of bubbles and cut our losses. The seafood platter was meh. Not worth the $95. But the bubbles were good!! My advice: just don't do it. Ok for a drink at the bar but otherwise save your money.
