pRlO48w4GkWEPEYIH2tHsw It's my 2nd time here and was dissapointed. It seems that the menu got smaller and I wasn't really satisfied with the meal. Ordered salad and a sandwich. Salad was ok but sandwich was dissapointing, kind of lacked flavor. The fries were good at least. And the bread for appetizer was good as well. I enjoyed my first visit more. Service is very good and fast.
