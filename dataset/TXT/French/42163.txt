Then it became a little more of a low-volume Hum.

Then my teeth started rattling, just a little bit.

I went and looked in the mirror into my opened mouth, and it hit me as to what was happening.

My taste buds were.....what?.....chanting......????

All I heard was tiny little echo of  "We Are Not Worthy.....We Are Not Worthy" over and over again, building to a crescendo, then stopping abruptly. 

Then they took a low bow.

This was right after eating the Mardi-Gras-inspired Comte ~ ham ~ celery root rémoulade crêpe from TGF today.

It was seriously one of the best things to ever cross my taste buds.

This truck is worthy of the hype.  Some aren't - but this one IS.

I've still yet to get a taste of the duck fat fries - went too early once, and this time I was too late as they were sold out.  Darnedest luck.

Go out of your way to visit these nice folks and their other-worldly crêpes.  You will not be disappointed.
