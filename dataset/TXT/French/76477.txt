Yp9w4nhUowBU_IS_StFXbQ We went here for brunch and ordered the pastry basket, lobster appetizer, dungeness crab club, pancakes, bacon, apple chicken sausage, and marble potato hash.

The pastry basket was awesome with that butter and those fruit preserves.

I wish I could tell you about the lobster appetizer but it never came out.

Pancakes were nice and fluffy.

Crab club was OK.

the sides were good with the apple chicken sausage being the star.  The bacon and potatoes were OK too.

Tableau gets 3 stars just for the food.  The server seemed like she didn't want to be there and ignoring us and forgetting an order is just not acceptable for the price of the food.
