ZrHU8ZzwZQjTRpB1K_8JTQ I have nothing but good things to say about The Stamm House and I was disappointed to see such terrible reviews below. If they were mediocre when they first opened, they have made great strides in the past few months.

The space is absolutely gorgeous and the menu has a small paragraph about the history of the building. We ended up sitting downstairs in the bar area for dinner, but I toured the upstairs space and it was equally beautiful. 

To drink, my friend got the "autumn special," which tasted like a pumpkin spice tea with booze in it, really tasty. I got white wine, which was also really good.

For dinner, I got the fish fry special and was blown away with the portion and side dishes that came with it. I opted for the Wisconsin fish (there was also an Alaskan option) and the portion didn't fit on the plate. It came with 3 sides: coleslaw, pickled veggies, and roasted potatoes. Everything was really good and I ate it all, despite being a huge portion.

Overall service was great, food was delicious, and the space was enchanting. What more can you ask for on a romantic date night?
