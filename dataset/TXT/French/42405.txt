The potatoes that came with the dish were pretty excellent, but I was unimpressed with the benny. It was put into a broiler which over cooked the eggs and gave the hollandaise a hard brown crust on top. When I order eggs benedict, I look for that buttery sauce. It was more like silly putty over an egg. : / the OJ was good and service was decent.
