4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw This is a great place to sit outside and watch the world go by. It was so hot,we chose inside. Nothing spectacular. I would have chose something else but,I was there and what the hell. I ordered a steak which was the same quality as Ellis Island and at Ellis, the steak would have been half the price of this place.If you can get on the patio,go for it.I do not think inside is worth the money.
