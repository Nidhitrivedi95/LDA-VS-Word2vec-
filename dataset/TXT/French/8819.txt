4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw The breakfast was great (eggs Benedict, wife had spinach and goat cheese omelet (really good)); however, bacon was burnt and dining room was quite warm to 12 out of 15 people in our party, hence the four stars. They did turn on the ac at our request. The service was exceptional for a casino restaurant I will definitely come back.
