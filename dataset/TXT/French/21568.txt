I started with the fritto misto which was satisfactory.  Shrimp, calamari and cod were lightly battered and generally tender.  The dipping sauce light and not particularly exciting.  

I followed this with lamb chops.  They were cooked just right, and fairly tender, but under-flavored: the rosemary and roasted garlic mentioned on the menu were difficult to detect.

As my main, I ordered the duo of duck: a roasted breast, and leg confit.  The breast was acceptable, but a little on the chewy side; similarly, the leg was okay, but a little dried out.  The blueberry balsamic sauce was dull with muted flavors.  Further, the duck flesh itself was not as flavorful as I expect duck to be.

Finally, I had the mixed berry crepe for dessert.  It was filled with a vanilla gelato which allegedly had berries mixed into it, but they were barely noticeable.  The crepe itself was a little stiff (i.e. stale) as though it had been sitting around for a while.

In contrast to the food, the service was quite good.  The waiter even turned up the air-conditioning without us asking (I think he overheard us saying we were hot). 

Overall, the food was not bad or offensive, but really quite boring and mediocre.  I will avoid this restaurant in the future.
