UxWH8zRYIBgs6Q2oykvRdw Cluny has a great location and is a great looking restaurant. I was taking my girlfriend here for her birthday dinner with reservations booked in advance. Started off well when the restaurant called me and offered a free dessert for the birthday; however upon arriving, despite the reservation we had to wait in the lobby for a table to free up. The food was great overall. The service was just okay. Seems they also forgot about the birthday because the dessert was on the bill and there was no message or candle on the plate.
