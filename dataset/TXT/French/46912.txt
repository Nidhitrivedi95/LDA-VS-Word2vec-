Nm7puiFh38hZbPGSdXbGgw When all you need is something fast and filling, this is the place to be! Chicken Souvlaki, Burgers, Poutine, Pizza, Onion Rings... Miracle has it all, and it's a great place to chill out and grab some "health" food particularly after a long 12 hour day of working. 

In St-Henri there are many different other pizza/burger joints, but this is the one for me!
