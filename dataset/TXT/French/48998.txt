OkC86YtZ0Nm19my5F4GGrQ My husband and I went here for a Valentine's Day lunch (he is out of town during the week). It is a cozy place with a gorgeous bar and a red tile ceiling. I had the lunch combo: mixed greens salad, fromage tartine, and legume soup. Everything was so good and the portion size was perfect. The tartine had crisp fresh bread with cheese and fresh sliced tomato. We also split the creme brulee which was really good. This is one of the best lunches out I have had in a while. I am a vegetarian and the last couple restaurants we tried just didn't do their vegetarian options well. This one was spot on. Simple and really good.
