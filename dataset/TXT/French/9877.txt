4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I usually do not go to French restaurants because they are over my budget but here the pricing was moderate. The food was excellent. We hard scallops which were very large and cooked to perfection. We also ordered  a cheaper cut of meat which was as tender as a higher cut. A balsamic reduction that was perfect.
Salad greens very fresh. The best part is I ordered wine by the glass and it was very good and reasonable ( $9)
The waiter was very pleasant and the food come out quickly
The only down was after we where seated it took a while for our waiter to show up about 15 minutes but we did not mind we where seated outside and the water fountain show at the Bellaggio is excellent to watch ,we also were able to enjoy a street performer about 30 feet away on sidewalk.
Total bill for 4 was 175.00
