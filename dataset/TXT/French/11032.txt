4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Best steak frites I've had! We came in November and it looked pretty packed. I was expecting a long wait but we were seated immediately inside. 

I got the peppercorn one and boyfriend got the Merlot steak. The steaks were seasoned well and cooked just how we asked. The fries were thin, long, and cooked to a perfect crisp without any unnecessary reused grease flavor- you know what I'm talking about! We also got the house special pate. I rather enjoyed it. The bread here was just the right balance of crispy and chewy. None of that over baked, roof-of-mouth scratchiness. The pate was hard, in that it wasn't mushy like cat food. You have to cut it. It comes with capers, some greens, pickles, onions (I think). It's something you should try if you go there, the quality exceeds other pates I've had.
