wwgRu0TAMX8rfRhsiI0ifQ First of all: this is my second time here, and I wasn't impressed the first time.  This time, we went for heavy appetizers and drinks before seeing the new Star Wars movie.

Now, I'm a fan.  They streamlined down the menu and upscaled the liquor selection.  The bartender knew how to make a proper wet martini (and she was bloody gorgeous, which doesn't hurt, either).  The antipasti plate was full to the brim and delicious, the mussels were cooked perfectly, and there was a guy with a guitar playing in the bar who was great accompaniment to the meal.

I opened Aliante as a dealer back in 2008, and it has a special place in my heart.  I try to go there as often as I can, and now I have a favorite watering hole there in which to drink and munch.

If you're going to the movies and want a great little place for a drink and food before and/or after, this is a good place for you.
