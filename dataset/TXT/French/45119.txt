mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q Dam! I was there yesterday and didnt even bother to ask if Joel was there =( Would of loved to say hi!

Ok, I watch food network and all the shows. I have ALWAYS wanted to jump in the TV and eat what they were making.

My fiance and I went on Vacation and I decided to splurge on some great food. We have been saving to get out of town and we spent a very great chunk of our vacation $$$ just so I could eat like I have always wanted to. We are not fancy looking people, we were just 2 kids that work very hard wanting to feel special. They treated us with such respect.

OMG!!!! My fiance is NOT into food like me and he was blown away! I We had the 9 course meal and each and every bite was delightful!I One of the dishes, we were watching one of the chefs prepare, was so intriguing as she was seriously strategically placing each grain of salt, herbs etc. on the plate.And boy could you taste every grain of ingredient in there. 

Well worth the $$$ and will be going back for our anniversary every year!
Thank you for the meal of a lifetime!
