Dcj69NZJnbJhK-YHP_nULA Tuesday night sliders!  My friend took me here while I was visiting Madison.  Sat on the newly-expanded side of the bar and had a great experience.  Knowledgable bartenders helped us choose the perfect Belgium beer to accompany my sliders on a chilly, February night.  Loved the pairings and unique presentation of our food.  (We also ordered a couple of salads and lentil soup.)  Will definitely come here again when back in Mad-town!
