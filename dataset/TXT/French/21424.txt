What's interesting about this restaurant is that the menu is constantly revolving and they use whatever ingredients they have on hand.  

I came here during restaurant and had the pleasure of trying multiple dishes.  For the first course, a salmon crepe was selected.  It was minced salmon wrapped in a crepe.  The sauce was an olive oil drizzle.  The crepe was crispy on the outside, and the smoked Scottish salmon has a slight saltiness to it bringing out the flavor of the dish.  

For the main course, it was a tender filet.  The outside was a bit overcooked, but the inside was tender.  I was surprised that the waiter never asked us how we like it prepared, and I had forgotten to specify have a medium-rare steak.  The taste wasn't memorable, but the presentation was lovely.  For the main course, I had a chance to taste my friend's Bouillabaisse.  I almost wished that was on the restaurant week's menu.  Unlike some of the other bouillabaise, they didn't overdo the tomato in the sauce and had a very creamy soup making the dish light, but flavorful.  The variety of herbs brought out the natural flavors of the seafood.

The dessert was a vanilla soufflé.  The texture was so fluffy and luxurious.  The cream drizzled on top wasn't that sweet too making it a perfect end to the end without overdoing it.  

Overall I had good service and lovely experience on the food.  I would stick with the classic countryside simple French dishes, and you'll probably be able to enjoy new dishes each time when you come.
