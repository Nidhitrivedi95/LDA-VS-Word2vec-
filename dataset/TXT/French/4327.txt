Food and service were worth meandering around the city in freezing temperatures and slipping and falling on my butt a few times while walking around trying to amuse ourselves until our table was ready. Chicken liver pate was easily one of the best I've ever had, and frankly, the price was right. Large enough to share but I wasn't big into that because who knows when ill have a pate like this again. Big thanks to the staff for a great dinner and for treating us like old friends.
