1aj4TG0eFq6NaPBKk6bK7Q I stopped at Jaques for lunch yesterday.  The food was outstanding.  Fresh, great quality and innovative!!!!  I had the porcine mushroom and butternut squash soup and half grilled chicken sandwich on a cibatta bread.  very yummy!  I did not have any of their pastries, but I was tempted.  I tend to be a regular at this restaurant.
