5EIuCcoHY2evAhFMBV6G6g had breakfast here - service was lamentable - water?  coffee?  getting our orders wrong?  had to ask for everything and manage our waiter's job.  the croque madame had a poached egg on it?  wtf? at least get your french recipes right.  sheesh.   the coffee was so weak - when we could get it, we had to drink like ten cups of it, and then still ended up at illy.

in vegas, when you want something filling for breakfast, I'd wait it out and have a croissant or  a bagel and a starbucks - wait for lunch.
