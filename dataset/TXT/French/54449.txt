rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw Came here with my girlfriend for her birthday bc we wanted to try at least one gourmet restaurant and I love French food. 

Great decor, very brasserie/French feeling. It was bougie and anything but pretentious, the people at the table next to us were in fanny packs (blast from the past much?)

We started by splitting a French onion soup (my first not counting what they serve at Panera) and it was deliciously indulgent. The melted Gruyere was to die for, and overall very flavorful. 

My girlfriend ordered the cod/bass (I forget which one but I'm too lazy to look it up) and I tried hers, it was quite excellent. Me, I'm a fan of a perfectly cooked roast chicken and I was served just that here. My only gripe was that the Au jus/drippings served on the side, the server poured it all over my chicken rather than letting me do it myself. Hence my bird was on the saltier end, more than I would like, but it was not unpleasant in the slightest. 

The biggest surprise was the mushroom bread pudding which came with my chicken. I didn't think two things such as mushrooms and bread pudding could be combined so deliciously but they were. My girlfriend hates Mushrooms but even she was floored by how good it tasted. 

The portions are gigantic btw so just be warned. I didn't think I could ever feel defeated by a meal but my gut was stuffed beyond doubt when I hit the 3/4th mark. My girlfriend threw in the towel much earlier so as such, neither of us could enjoy the dessert menu. However in our food coma states, we were not so secretly staring down the Mille feuille that the fanny pack folks were digging into next to us bc it looked delicious.
