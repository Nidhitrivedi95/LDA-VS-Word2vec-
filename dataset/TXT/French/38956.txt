jLxeBgWhLRbII2ACkgH1Sg We had a great breakfast at this little bakery and cafe.  The employees were very nice. One of the staff noticed our Paris guide book, as we were planning our trip, and he wrote a whole list of things to see that weren't touristy. 

The food was amazing. We each had a pastry and a hot item, the quiche and croque-monsiure were excellent.  While eating outside the owners walked up and asked how our meal was.  There were several expats eating there, can't be too far off authentic.

We will return again. Thanks.
