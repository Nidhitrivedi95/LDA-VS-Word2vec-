I like their creative "bistro" takes on certain foods (very good tuna), but it seems like the portions are tapa sized. Appeals very strongly to scottsdale-ites I'm sure, but if you don't have money to blow then pass this place up because they have exorbitant prices because of commercial rent they must pay.
