4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I went here for breakfast with a group.  First off, no seating of incomplete parties.  I don't see that as a negative, but some may.

We got a great table outside and got to people watch til our hearts were content while gnawing on some tasty food.  I got the standard fare of 3 eggs with toast and bacon and coffee.  Unfortunately, it's pretty hard to go much higher than 3 stars for that or much lower. (OK, it's not hard to go lower, but it's pretty tough to screw that up)  The bacon was actually amazingly good - nice and thick cuts with what my burned out palate detected as somewhat maple-y as well.  The eggs were fine as was the toast and potatoes.  

Perhaps, on another drunk weekend, I'll stop in and be more adventurous.
