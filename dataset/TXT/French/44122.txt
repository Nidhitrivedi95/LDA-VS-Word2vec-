MdjIl105vqCYUGKFSUVytA Me and the hubby had the Sunday brunch just this past weekend on Valentine's day. We were lucky enough to get a reservation and what a pleasant surprise!

I'll start off with the good- we were seated within a few minutes of arriving for our 10am reservation. They took out coats, promptly brought the coffee, and directed us to the buffet. The food really is fantastic. We are both vegetarians but we do eat eggs and this buffet does not disappoint. Plenty of options, something for everyone and what a treat for the eyes! Photo ops everywhere, kind of funny to see everyone's so busy taking photos they hardly take the time to enjoy themselves.

Now the not so nice parts -although you give your table number at the egg station for omlettes /Benny's, the staff is seen going from table to table asking did you order this?? It was amusing at first but then it became annoying. We were interrupted over 5 times with someone else's eggs being brought over. Why? I have no idea.

Also closer to the end of the 2 hours brunch time slot, there were huge crowds huddled around the buffet. Taking pictures, blocking walkways to the washrooms. Really awkward. They have nowhere to stand and you have to excuse yourself 20 times to get a plate of food. Management needs to figure this out.. Other than that our day was great! We loved it! Pricing is steep but you do get what you pay for! Definitely a good brunch spot find.
