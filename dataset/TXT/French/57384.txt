rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I am so in love. Everyone on staff there was just so wonderful. As soon as we walked up to the hostess stand, the girls were just great and we were cracking jokes. Our waitress was very attentive and took our drink order right away almost as soon as we sat down. I ordered the iced coffee and my boyfriend order the mimosa. I truly loved how the iced coffee comes in a carafe with ice in a glass so I didn't have to wait for refills. The coffee was very flavorful and truly refreshing. The epi bread that comes to every table is so amazing! I'm not even ashamed to admit I ate the whole thing because it was so good. 

For my brunch, I ordered the Hachis de Merguez which was somewhat like hash. It was amazing sausage diced up and sauteed together with pepper and onions topped with fluffy, moist, delicious eggs. The sausage was surprisingly sweet and smoky. My boyfriend ordered the Petit Dejeuner Americane, or the breakfast sampler platter, that was to die for! I had a bite of the potato croquet and it was so yummy. The food was everything I ever imagined, as a huge fan girl of Thomas Keller. 

The only negative I have to say is after we placed our order for drinks, they took 10-15 minutes to arrive for iced coffee and a mimosa. I was anxious for some coffee and it just seemed to take an unusually long time for them to arrive. Everything after that came right after the other and very quickly and flawless.
