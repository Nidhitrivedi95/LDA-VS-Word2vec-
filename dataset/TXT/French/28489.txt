The rest of the reviews sum it up. It's not that expensive (considering other restaurants), it's damn delicious, and you don't feel rushed (nor do you feel like you have to wait too long).

The escargot was the best I've ever had, and a few other dishes also made me go "damn."

Best part is that it's not pretentious, so it was a very comfortable meal.

One tip - gonna do bar service next time. The kitchen is right next to it, so a very cool vantage point to see all the food made.
