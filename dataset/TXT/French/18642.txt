aervNtqzrKf0CGrFo4xfKw I came with a group of four on a thursday night; it was very quiet inside but the patio was packed. I personally had the p'tit poulet crepe (chicken, spinach, mushroom, shallots, white cheddar), and within our group we also ordered the rafael crepe (shrimp, scallop, mushroom), the saute fruits de mer, and the daily soup.
Their drinks were very good! One of the bartenders' specialties is a blueberry mojito which was delicious.
Food was only moderate, nothing too special. The p'tit poulet was good upon the first few bites but very quickly became too heavy for my liking and definitely too much in one serving - I was unable to finish my crepe.
The service was good. We had a very kind and attentive waitress who was quick to modify my drink order when it had been made incorrectly.
