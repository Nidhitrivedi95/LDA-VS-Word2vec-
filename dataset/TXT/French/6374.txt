4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Based on its own merits the food and experience was good, but based on expectations and price I was very disappointed.  A French Bistro that doesn't have pastries available for breakfast.  Crowded, loud, expensive for just pretty good.  Pass.  I compare it to Bouchon over at The Venetian...there is no comparison.  Go to Bouchon.
