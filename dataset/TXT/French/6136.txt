3uC7Lbc3RgUDTWQlBu4PqQ After my dinner at B&B Burger where no dessert is offered, I walked around the corner to this little spot where I got a pumpkin tart.  The tart was very good and just what I'd expect from Bouchon.  The only problem with this small outlet near the sports book and clock tower is there is no place to sit.  It is almost entirely takeout.

The tart was boxed which wasn't necessary.  I ended up removing the tart from the box and using one of their plastic forks to start eating the tart.  I soon gave up and picked it up and ate it like that.

There's a water dispenser at the bar with the plasticware and sugars/creams for coffee, but it wasn't working.  After finishing, I went to the nearest bathroom in the casino to wash my hands.

A great little pastry and a perfect end to a dinner somewhere else!
