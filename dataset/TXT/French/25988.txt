d482l58ho0_IMdFkXX1F5Q Stopped in on a Sunday pub/appetizer crawls because of two words-  Happy Hour!  Sat at the bar to check out their wine and beer selections but ordered appetizers too because of the choice offerings... Country pâté anyone?  Feasted while drinking Rose and ended up resting our feet while we caught up on College Football predictions on the flatscreen.  Enjoyed a chat with another couple doing the same.  Bartenders are so nice and knowledgeable and will even let you take a $5 glass of wine to go back out into the casino or strolling St. Mark's Square.  Definitely reserving a table for a romantic French dinner next visit to Vegas.
