0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g Went to Picasso this past Wednesday and the service was horrible for a Michelin rated restaurant. Not only was service/course timing poor, the food was mediocre at best. SW at Wynn and Bazaar Meats at SLS killed it. I didn't mind spending $800+ there but we left Picasso wanting to go to In and Out Burger for what would have been a superior experience.
