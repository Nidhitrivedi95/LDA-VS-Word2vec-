ShlPoJpwWCrkUvYy6fUEow I went On November 17th, 2013. The place is gorgeous, service is excellent, the food not meeting the expectation of a Belgian ! French Fries are not like the one that you will find in Belgium! That's the first thing that a Belgian should know how to do and I'm sorry this place doesn't know how to do real Belgian's French fries. Snails are good.
