HOev_2CifUcfIm9xDL_uaw We were in the area and found this wonderful cafe on Yelp!  The owner/chef is from Paris. He can cook.  I had the quiche it was the best I have ever had.  The favors just exploded in your mouth. My husband had the crepes with ham, cheese, and scrambled eggs.   Wonderful. We will be back for lunch!!!!!
