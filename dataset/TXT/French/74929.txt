xYy54Y2VTBAG5k7WJcaH4A My two dining companions and I had a wonderful dinner tonight. The surroundings are pretty ordinary, but the food and service quite inspired. The Lamb Osso Bucco was as good as I've ever had, and the apple tart for dessert was just right for the three of us. The place was busy but the service was attentive and unrushed. It was expensive but our Living Social coupon made it pretty reasonable....about $40 apiece.
