cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg After all the rave reviews about this place that I read, I found it thoroughly disappointing. The service was fine, but the restaurant itself was noisy and crowded. I had a foie gras appetizer and the bison tartare, but neither was anything special and the tartare was too heavy on capers. The food was expensive and just wasn't the good. After all the hype and waiting until 9pm just to get a table, I was expecting a dining experience and instead got just a meal.
