cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg If you love foie gras and you are in Montreal you have to come to this place. They have a foie gras section on the menu!! Far from a gimmick, everything is expertly and artfully prepared and the vibe of the restaurant is energetic, with an open kitchen.

I came here a year ago and saw there was a draft sitting in Yelp and it wouldn't let me delete it, so I thought I might as well write a quick review. They had this giant, delicious sugar pie for dessert and I only wish I had saved some more room to enjoy more of it.
