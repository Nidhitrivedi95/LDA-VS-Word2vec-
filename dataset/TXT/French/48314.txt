O66Zy8Y13VBm72ZDhS4fIg I was here for Brunch on Valentine's Day. My boyfriend ordered roses from a 3rd party, and the hostess delivered it to our table. I'm happy they offered that service, but I am a bit disappointed because my boyfriend had requested to have them delivered to our table at the end.

Brunch menu was a bit limited in my opinion. The blue cheese was delicious, the fresh bread was to die for! (Mouth watering as I type). The main course was okay. Ambience is nice. My only other complaint is that we were next to the corner booth - thank goodness we weren't stuck there because the tables were jam packed so tightly.

I had higher expectations of this place but I left with a content restaurant experience, but a great overall Valentine's Day.
