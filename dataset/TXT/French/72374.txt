XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q Ever wonder what it would be like to be one of those Iron Chef judges, getting to sample 8+ dishes that just looked absolutely mouth watering on screen?? Well now I do! My husband and I decided to live life dangerously so we both tried the 16 course tasting menu. With a price tag of $400+/person, this decision was not made lightly. We didn't even review what was included in the menu- we just wanted to be surprised and delighted. And surprised and delighted we were!! 
Each dish was elegantly masterfully crafted and created to please the palate and the senses. Puree of this, shaving of that, foam of this, with reduction of that... all combined perfectly to create a beautiful symphony of a meal. Not just saying that to justify to huge expense, but my husband and I really did enjoy every bite.... but if you don't dare try the 16 course taster, they are 6 courses and 3 course options + a la carte which doesn't put such a huge dent in your wallet....
Plus, did I mention the Bread cart??? How about the dessert cart??? Amazing. Put those bad boys in park by my table and we'll be just fine :)
