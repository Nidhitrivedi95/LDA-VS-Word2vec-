JFfZDmNAoa_MHG16K2BY6A delicious appetizers: steak tartare was very balanced, and beet salad was perfectly assembled and had a certain flare that set it apart from the typical been salad.

mains were excellent:  scallops and oxtail for my SO was intriguing and perfectly cooked, and I had the beef tenderloin, which on paper may sound uninspired but  was perfectly executed.

even better than the food was our server, who knew every ingredient in every dish and was able to describe every dish in exquisite, mouth-watering detail.  best server I've had in a looong time.  even the kid who was bussing our table seemed to know about wine and food.  

this resto is not be as hip as it once was, and no, it's not on ossington or dundas west, but it serves excellent food in a fairly simple, modern atmosphere.  and it was a pleasant surprise not to hear a soundtrack of random mp3s of all the indie rock darlings playing in the background, as is all too common in many restaurants.   

looking forward to going back.  both my SO and I agreed it was one of the best meals we've had in the past year or more.
