5EIuCcoHY2evAhFMBV6G6g Here for a Grazie Dinner Special.  Three course meal.  Appetizer, French onion soup or Caesar Salad, with a main course of fish or scallops or chicken, with a choice of chocolate pudding, sorbet, or ice cream for dessert, served with a glass of sparking wine.

The decor is like a French farmhouse, soft lighting with a candle at each table.  Service was a bit slow but the wait staff was very nice.  This is not fast food. This is fine dining.

They start with complimentary French rolls, whick are crunchy on the outside and fluffy on the inside, with a perfect chew. Pinot is also a bakery.

Appetizers

Caesar salad has a unique presentation, whole romaine lettuce leaves wrapped with a thin prosciutto strip and a bread stick.

The onion soup was hot and tasty with a nice cheese top with French bread croutons inside the broth.

Entree

The fish was perfectly pan seared with crisply skin on the outside but moist on the inside.

The scallops were served over a  watercress sauce  and were excellently prepared.  The presentation.was almost.too pretty to eat.  The  scallops had just the right tenure and flavor.

Dessert 

The croisant chocolate pudding is a twist on a classic bread pudding, presented warm on a vanilla sauce.

The Ice Cream is a trio of chocolate, vanilla, and coffee flavors. The ice cream has a truly rich flavor.

Rating

Overall, a great dining experience...five stars.  Just don't expect to spend less than 2 hours for dinner.
