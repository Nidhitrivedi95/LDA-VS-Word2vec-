XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q All I can say is go. And Yelp needs six dollar signs for some places ($$$$$$) like this one. 

Dinner was $455 for the 17 course tasting menu, water was extra (nearly $100 by the end of the night) and wine pairings for the large menu start at $295. Expect this before you come and prepare accordingly. 

Normally I would have done a wine pairing, but in this case I'm glad I did not. My reservation was for 6pm and did not finish until after 11pm. It was the right amount of time. 

The best piece of advice I can give. Be particular about enjoying each and every bite. You will be rewarded. Each sumptuous bite was orgasmic. Chef was on point tonight. 

There is nothing bad I can say about JR, treat yourself, save up and go. There are very very few opportunities to experience cooking at this level. 

Art.
