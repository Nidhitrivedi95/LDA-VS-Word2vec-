ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug A colleague attend a conference at Paris hotel every year, and usually find ourselves here for at least one meal as we did again this year.  There was a line, but they got us in fairly quickly.  Even though the restaurant looked pretty full, the service was fast and attentive.  My friend had the cheeseburger, which looked tasty and she said it was.  I had an omelet, which I had no complaints about.  This is great place to go when you want a restaurant atmosphere, but haven't made a reservation anywhere in advance, and at the end of a long day, don't want to leave the hotel to find something.  For where it is and what it is, it fills the bill.
