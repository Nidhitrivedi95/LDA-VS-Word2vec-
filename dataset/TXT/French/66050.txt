udFcIcbWbxrO8uLF95WnQg After trying almost all the nice restaurants in the Cleveland area, we had to give this newer restaurant a try as well and see if it's up to par with all the other ones. And just as we had hoped, this place did not disappoint!

For appetizers, I think it deserves a FIVE star! We ordered 2 appetizers - A stuffed pepper and a beef ceviche. Although you see these 2 dishes in many different restaurants, but the way they paired the 2 dishes with varies ingredients are just amazing! If you like spicy food, the stuffed pepper would be a good choice. And the beef ceviche, you can't even tell it's raw!

For the entrees, it deserves a 3.75 star. The reason being is that the Flounder fish we got was a little bit below expectation. Although the waitress said it'll be something that we've ever tasted in this world, it didn't shock anyone. The taste was good and feels like a healthy dish, but it wasn't anything out of the ordinary.
As for the whole roasted chicken dish, I would say that's much closer to having a out of this world taste than the flounder! The sweet and savory taste is amazing! And I loveeee the crunchy and tasty skin! Although the white meat was a little bit dry, but the dark meat makes everything worth it! I appreciate the fact it comes out with a side of veggies, but it was a little bit too creamy for my liking. 

Last, but not least, the dessert was ABSOLUTELY amazing! We tried the Meringues, which looked like a big white macaroon. The dessert is nothing like what we expected, and it melts in your mouth! And yes, the dessert deserves a 5 as well!

Oh, one more thing, their drinks are very interesting as well. The pear drink was surprisingly sour! Very interesting drinks there too. Overall, we were very happy with the restaurant. And would love to go back and try some other items on the menu!
