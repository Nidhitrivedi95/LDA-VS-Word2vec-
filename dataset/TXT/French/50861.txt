oZHbPhIj01_31jqD053a_Q The restaurant is beautiful and classy from the moment that you walk in. They took our coats and seated us promptly. The table on the top floor near the stairs bounced from time to time as people walked heavily. The presentations were beautifully prepared, the wine menu was extensive. 

The presentations were fun, but I was more interested in the underlying food. The popcorn was too old and hard, the cigars too salty, the smoke from the salmon box was delightful. The butters were interesting and the bread fresh but overly crusty. The clafoutis was served in an incredible little dish. The foie gras was good but not the best that I have ever had, the caramelization was a bit too deep, the canele didn't have the crisp exterior, though the cloudberry was nice. The veal cheek was incredibly beefy in flavour, the potatoes on top were wonderful. Dessert was beautiful to behold but not as sweet as I would have liked. The champagne macaron didn't really have a great champagne flavour, but the macaron was well made.

Do this for the experience. The delights of having different plates put in front of you with interesting containers. It's a beautiful presentation and the service.
