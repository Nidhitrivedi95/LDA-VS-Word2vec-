tCSlpwJQ4CZsUEMZeH2SFg Have been coming here for about 3 years,  and I am beginning to wonder why. 

Was in for dinner recently, service was good, wine was good but at $14 a glass for  Sauv Blanc over priced. I had the "herb roasted" chicken.... dry, and flavorless. She ordered the crab cakes which were a style I have Never seen before ... 3 round disks that were flattened beyond recognition maybe 1/4" thick, total weight Maybe 2 oz! Half the plate was filled with red pepper aioli ... ( mayo and canned red peppers) seriously the mayo was twice the weight and surface area of the crab pancakes ?? I guess the "crab" was the accompaniment ?? the remainder of the plate was filled with spinach that was barely warmed and wilted mixed with very obviously canned peppers and nothing was done to hide that fact. We rarely complain, but did this time, the server ( Caroline I think) was very good about it. The replacement pasta was better but not by much. 

Great location, but with the new competition the kitchen needs to get its act together.
I am giving 2 stars for the service only.
