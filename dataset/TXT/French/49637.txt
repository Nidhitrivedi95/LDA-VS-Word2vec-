or4UVDjXEEjze3wNPjoAZA Forgot to eat lunch at lunch time again.... Stopped by Zinc to find they were only serving from their afternoon menu but it looked good to us so we decided to give it a try.

Can recommend the Zinc Burger....open faced with bacon and blue cheese...very tasty! The Pate was not quite what I expected...it was very flavorsome but I had expected a different texture and taste...it was served  as a slab that needed to be cut rather than spread...I also would have preferred a plain baguette rather than the marble bread that it was served with....the Bordeaux that I had was very good though...cannot remember the name and it is not on their online menu.

But this is the BEST part .... Dessert! : ) Once again not meant to be ordering dessert till the holiday indulgences are paid for but oh well .... this was yet again one that was not meant to be missed....THE ZINC VALRONA CHOCOLATE SOUFFLE with warm Grand Marnier Sauce : ) .... Chocolate heaven. 

Their cappucinos are also very good and served with biscotti. 

Zinc is a lovely little spot whether you are sitting inside or outside and the staff are five star.
