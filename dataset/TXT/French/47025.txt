nWW6fBfBljiRFa4sG7TyxA I went to the Black Pig and left hungry, poorer, and disappointed.  

I ordered the beet salad for an appetizer that was primarily composed of tough, bitter greens.  On top there were strands of beet, but they were missing the vibrant purple hue and sweet flavor of a good beet.  I'm assuming that both of these were locally sourced which is a mistake after a long hot summer.  Chefs need to pick and choose more.  Local vegetables can be bad too.

For my meal I got a burger, which was fine, but overcooked.  They tried to add some stylish accouterments, but it ended up falling flat.  A Bar Cento burger is better and cheaper (esp. at happy hour!); he should have just recycled that recipe.

My girlfriend got the scallops which consisted of 4 scallops and 5 pieces of asparagus ($5.50 per scallop).  She thought they were somewhat overcooked and didn't have the smooth buttery texture you'd expect at a nice restaurant.  

To sum up the Black Pig: small portion sizes, high prices, pedestrian food.  You'll be better served going anywhere else on W. 25th.
