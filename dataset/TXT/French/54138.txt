r4hP0FlsYVr-0bv-kdFIBw Taking 3 children out for fine dining can be a little daunting.  Our kids are well behaved, but still, you get an unwelcome feeling often, even when you just walk in.  Not so at Nice Bistro...from the moment you walk through the door you are greeted so warmly, you feel like family.  The hostess / owner is wonderful, speaking to everyone in her mother tongue, but making sure the young ones understand.  Chef coming to chat and welcome you also.  Then the deliciousness begins.  It's not often we go out that every dish is fabulous, but that was the case.  Blackboard special jambalaya, steak frite cooked to delicious perfection, the bouillabaisse was amazing, and they even made a special omelette for one of our children who couldn't decide between the menu choices. My only wish was that I had more room for more! We managed to squeeze in some shared desserts....a delicious crepe, and possibly the best bread pudding I have ever eaten. 
Our first trip here in 9 years, and we can't fathom why we waited so long.  It will definitely be a more regular feature for us.
