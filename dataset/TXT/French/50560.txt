OYHpqY6-3C-wXR-uPbHhwA Went Saturday 7-11-15 at 8 pm.  Parked and began approaching the door but noticed there were chairs stacked up in front of the door and the "open" sign was turned off.  Shame on you, closing an hour early! Boo! 

Went back yesterday 7-26-15 around 2PM to see if they could redeem themselves.  Hint: they did not.  I wish I had never went there.  It pains me to do this because they were so darn nice.  

Have you ever been to a national park and went to the gift shop/restaurant there and thought "well, this sucks but it's the only thing here." ?  Well that's how i felt here. Our server, Amy, was incredibly nice and knowledgeable but she couldn't save this place.  

It took 15 minutes or so for three people to get "gelato".  We were served what I suspect was ice cream.  They ran out of whatever containers they usually serve it in and we got to-go coffee cups.  All three of us had to make a separate trip to the front counter to ask for a spoon.  I got six macarons and two scoops of ice cream for $12.38.  

Have you ever been at your Nana's house and she offers you ice cream she bought six months ago?  Ya know the kind that has ice chunks and a layer of congealed goo in it?  That's what this was like.  There was a gummy film over all the gelato and instead of scraping it off Amy served it to us like that.  It was awful.  

Macarons tried: 
Coconut
Black Currant
Almond
Pistachio
Strawberry
Lemon 

The display case was kinda empty and dissapointing.  I will never be back here and I do not expect this restaurant to last the rest of the year.  Two strikes and you're out, Honey Cakes.
