HOev_2CifUcfIm9xDL_uaw I have been here twice and I love it so much!

I eat so much food there which is unusual for me since I don't like the feeling of being over full. This food is great because it doesn't make you feel like crap after. Both times, I had the same thing because I am obsessed with it: French onion soup, quiche Lorraine with the side salad and a couple of crepes. They are so reasonably priced that you could order the whole menu and not feel bad about it.
