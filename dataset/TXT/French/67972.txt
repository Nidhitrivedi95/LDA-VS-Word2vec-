v50-nvBCZNf7nCNbyUlQLw This place is located in my favorite Walnut St.I just love walking in this place and enjoying the good vibes.And we came to this place for brunch and ordered veggie crepes.

  The place was small and completely packed. And their service was slow,i blame it on the crowd. The crepe was like paper,but it totally dissolved in your mouth. The lightest brunch ever!

  If you hate eating heavy meals,then this is the place for you.The place somehow reminded me of old European movies,with the old round tables and wooden chairs arranged very close to each other and to add a cherry to the cake, this was a house converted into a restaurant.

 I would love to go back here to try the Desert crepes :)
