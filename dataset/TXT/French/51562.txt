We attended one of Chef Eric's wine classes. Chef is extremely educated on wine and it shows in his excitement and knowledge of the wines of the world. While we knew that food was not part of the class, it would serve best to grab a bite to eat before you get to the class. There was a plate of exceptional food after the class and the Chef was very accommodating to allergies or other food concerns. Just let him know ahead of time.

The staff is friendly and follows the easy-going nature of Chef. This event is a must attend even if you know your regional and international wines. It's informative, interesting, and just plain fun.

On a side note, we have attended a Chef's menu dinner at the restaurant and the food is superb.
