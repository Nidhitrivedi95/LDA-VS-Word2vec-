3rj1qpgFvkRWtAka17mhEQ I just move to this side of town  and by far its my favorite . The food was hot and fresh the service was excel . Our waitress was on top of detail and make sure we had everything we needed. The manger gifted is some muffins for being 1st timer . The price was just plus we even got to bring food home for left over . I highly recommend this place .
