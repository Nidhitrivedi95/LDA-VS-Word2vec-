lQ9VmIWvM6v-rONPkYX8aQ I can't believe this is a 2 star Michelin rated restaurant. My husband and I had the tasting menu here and felt we had better food at restaurants that aren't even rated. I give it 2 stars - one for outstanding service (as to be expected) and one for the good desserts (minus the macaroons b/c we had better ones at the McDonald's in France!). 

Other than that, there was only ONE dish on the tasting menu that was good (not great, good), and that was the lobster linguine with one piece of uni on top. The rest of the dishes were either blah or made me feel like I was about to have a heart attack. The foie gras and wagu beef were both so fatty that I couldn't even finish either of them. 4 strips of wagu beef, and I struggled to eat 2 of them. Way too much fat that I can clearly SEE and taste in it. Ugh, even thinking about it now makes me want to puke. 

The only highlight of the night was that Kelly Ripa and Regis Philbin were sitting behind us! Other than that, I can easily say that we will never waste our money here again. So not worth it!!!
