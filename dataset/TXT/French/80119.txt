zw4Legbcu018p5WcZ74iWA This was my go-to breakfast spot while on my mini get-away. I was recommended this place by a friend and it did not disappoint. Food and service were superb! Customer service was excellent - the guys were so nice and friendly. The price of the food were acceptable - not dirt cheap but not ridiculously expensive - I'd say it's averagely priced. While the place is a bit small, the vibe of the restaurant is great. Only complaint - although I did not bring it to their attention - was that my last meal there had a long thick black hair tangled in my bacon (if you zoom into my picture - you can see the strand of hair over the eggs, orange and bacon on the right) :( I'm not easily grossed out and I know this happens so I let it pass. All in all - great cute place on a budget. Will definitely come by again when I'm back in Montreal!
