I've been here before for lunch, and remember liking it.  I had a salad with crab cakes, and a cappuccino.  Everything was good.
My boyfriend, and I decided to try this place for breakfast.  I had eggs Benedict.  They were really runny.  The whites hadn't even set.  My boyfriend had an omelet.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't really inspiring either.  It would have been better if it wasn't quite so dry, and it would have been excusable if the price wasn't nearly 10 dollars each dish.  When I pay that much for eggs, I generally expect some kind of quality.  Same goes for the mimosa I ordered.  For $7 a glass, I'd expect at least Korbel.  I couldn't recognize the brand that they were serving, and although it was still very enjoyable,  it definitely wasn't anything special.    
The service wasn't anything to write home about either.  When my boyfriend left for a few minutes, the waitress ran up, and snatched his plate.  There was a lot of food on it that we were planning on taking home.  I asked her for a box, and she went to get one.  I shook my head, and turned my attention back to my potatoes just to realize that she snatched the ketchup, and all of the condiments off the table while I was still eating.   
I would give Mimi's 2 stars, but I'm adding one because their lunch is usually better.
