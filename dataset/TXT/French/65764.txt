uB6gdgo8pL4baMgdc4vS3A Great experience. Room was great as was the staff. Breakfast is buffet only. Good the first day, meh the next. You could tell it was a training experience for the students when a line formed waiting for clean plates and multiple staff just walked by.

There is a great crepe place across the street: La Bulle au Carre. 

This is a good location for shipping and wandering. Square St. Louis is a lovely park.
