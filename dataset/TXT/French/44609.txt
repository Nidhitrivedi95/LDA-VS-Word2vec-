mnn--vaYHtNyBNYFYBFIog This place had a great ambience - the open wine cellar was very unique. We started off with the champagne tasting (can't go wrong there) however, we went towards the a la carte menu, not being very hungry - I felt the dishes were a bit disappointing but that may be because everyone around us was enjoying the tasting menu. I'd definitely go that route next time.
