ucgzkl7atsBMGu4gGpmHfw Lovely ambiance and service. Presentation was beautiful. My salade niçoise was really bad though. Not recommended. It has an anchovy dressing, which should have given it away but it smelled horrible. I was on a date and didn't want to complain, but the tuna steaks were also cold and raw (seared on the exterior?) and I didn't expect that. If the menu explained it better I would have chose otherwise. I think I'm spoiled having tried this salad first in Nice so nothing compares, but my anchovy loving boyfriend couldn't even take the smell of the salad. Truly gross! It almost smelled like the dressing went off. Liked the quail eggs though :)
