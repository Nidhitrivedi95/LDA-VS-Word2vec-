I ordered the lamb shoulder and it was perfectly cooked plus a great portion. My wife went with the duck (her first taste of duck ever) and she loved every bite. The service was great and the restaurant itself was very accommodating considering it was a Saturday and we didn't have a reservation. The building looks like a firehouse but the interior is very clean and stylish. This is not the cheapest place in Montreal but sometimes it's worth the extra few bucks for a quality meal.
