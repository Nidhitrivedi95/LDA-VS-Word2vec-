The pricing was a bit high, but the wine selection was perfect and the food put a terrific twist on some of my absolute favorites. I cannot even explain how great it is to be confused as to which dish to order these days. Monk Fish, Rib Eye with Escargot Sauce (amazing!), and all of the classics... If you want to experience fine dining in Vegas, you have to go here. Yes you are at the Paris, yes you are in an Eiffel Tower Replica (the real one does not have dining like this) and yes you are on the strip...who knew that they could have such high standards and deliver this well? I do now!
