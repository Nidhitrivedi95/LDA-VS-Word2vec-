JJ1Ruu37kn66YSWUmCKNCw I'm from San Francisco, but when I make my 2 yearly trips to Montreal, I have to visit L'Academie!
My favorite dish is the mussels, but the other stuff is good too.
Prices are VERY reasonable and it's a BYO Wine, so you can't beat that.

I always get great service and the ambiance is good too.
