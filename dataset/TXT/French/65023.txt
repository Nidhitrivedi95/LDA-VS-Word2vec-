Tl2nqtPXlLbAG3qkUYVM2g This place did not disappoint. I love that I came here as a "just-because" dinner when the cuisine screams "special occasion" (5-stars for my smart date).

Highlights:
Duck tamales 
Lobster and basil pasta
Flourless chocolate cake that tasted like the corners of a brownie in every bite
Souflee that tasted like you were eating hot cocoa (that's a good thing by the way).
