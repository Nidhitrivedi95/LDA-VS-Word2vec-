ME6D5nLlfG0xZCtICOYDuw The Brasserie is one big cliche, from the French cafe patio furniture and French posters inside to the menu selection.  However, it stopped short of being cheesy.  The menu has those typical French dishes that you always hear about but don't usually find in restaurants.  Boeuf Bourginon, Cassoulet, Poulet grand-mere, etc.  Also a raw bar.

The food was excellent, but I would have like a bit more umph with the sides (those that came with the dishes, not a la carte).  Bread was fabulous.  I had two wines off the "interesting wine" section, and they were both very nice.

Service was good, and dinner was well paced even at prime time on Saturday night.

I will definitely be returning to try other dishes.  Maybe will just focus on bread, appetizers, and dessert!
