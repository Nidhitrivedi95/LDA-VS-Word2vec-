Y3e_rfMxAPFWI03ZgnpPxg Mistake indeed. No atmosphere. Bland food. Rude service.

I would like to elaborate but I am afraid I may become crass. We visited here  and I forgot then I already vowed not to set foot in this place when agreed to this visit. thus i gave them another chance, mistake. Over the years they have changed the lay out and decor. That is it I guess. Service and quality of food is questionable to say the least. 
It was perhaps we went with couple that run a B&B in France and they (& we) were expecting a little French hospitality and cuisine. Mistake. We instead got the French stereo type of ignorant and poohaa. And that was when I was truly trying to like it. OK - I haven't been here since, but I do hope that they have seriously changed their ways. However, with all the better places out there in Edinburgh I will not be spending my money here anytime soon.
