4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw This spot is on point. Great steak, great service and great ppl. 

To start off, I had reservations for 3 for dinner before heading to the airport. Thought to ourselves, why dont we have a nice lil dinner before my friends and I all head home from a weekend of partying.  We checked in with the hostess in front and shorty after we were taken to our seats.  We were seated in the patio which was great cause we had a front row seat of the bellagio water show:) and of course every 5 mins we were greeted by the drunks walking by with a "woohoo I'm drunk" lol classic Vegas! 

Now onto the food and service. Our waiter came by gave us bread and butter to start off and told us the special of the day.for appetizer we got escargot. Mmm delish! For my main course I got steak bordelaise. Which was also yum Yums (caramelized onions and red wine sauce Mmm) and can't forget the glass of red wine. 

I can't believe I didn't try this place sooner. Prices were lower than what I expected. I Definitely Had a great time here:)
