epvLkQNL6MOvk3s6JlTntA Carmon's is a dingy little restaurant that has cute "authentic" touches here and there - fans that look like jet engines, mismatched salt and pepper sets, crappy paper menus shoved onto a clipboard, an antique cash register - but their menu lacks a certain something. I came here with my mom for Sunday brunch, and I was told beforehand that there is minimal waitstaff and apparently only one cook in the kitchen. So I expected slow service.

What I didn't expect was crappy service, with the two waitresses serving everyone else before me and my mom, serving people who came after us, completely ignoring us for twenty minutes to get our order, plopping our plates down in front of us, and then giving us the wrong check, one that was ten dollars more than what we actualy ordered.

The food was standard. My mom had the ratatouille crepe which was okay, but sort of tasted "earthy" (read: like dirt), and my spinach crepe was drowning in creamed crap by the time I stuck my fork in it. And I asked for cheddar on top - what the hell? $2 for shitty American shredded cheese? My bad for expecting you to go out of your way to give me shavings of nice cheddar cheese. 

Don't expect me to come back here again. If I want to experience French food, I'll go somewhere guests are actually appreciated and the food doesn't take effing four hours to get to my table, while the owners and other waitresses mingle and act nice with people that look a certain type. No thanks.
