rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A The food was no where as good as I thought it would be, considering the raving reviews this place gets.  It was edible, but nothing spectacular.  I ordered the croque madame which pretty much tastes like ham, eggs, and toast that I could've made at home.  My friend had the corned beef hashed, which was not so much corned beef but diced ham.  The only thing good there was the chicken and waffles.

The waiter was pretty clueless, bringing wrong things and forgetting what some of our party ordered.  I wouldn't go back there again.
