aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw The service was excellent and there is a reason why i gave it a lesser star rating, last night i went to save christmas! by buying treats for the family. I got a discount since i work at the casino. I bought a ton of brownies and macaroons and things i can't describe. Anyway, me and a coworker were having fun and we got the order which came to 22$ which, is what i expected. 
My only complaint is i got home, overly excited about dessert that i nearly skipped dinner and went straight for one of my fave things in the world, Brownies only to be let down! :( it tasted like it was burnt, but nonetheless i gave it the benefit of the doubt and tried another... and another it all was horriblee :( luckily the other items i bought made up for it.
I'm a fan of great service so i would definetly come back, but i'm staying away from those brownies!
