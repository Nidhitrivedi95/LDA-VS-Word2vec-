B56AYe5GNuavMDtwFsXqzA My wife and I were at Petite Maison for Valentines and I am not sure what the previous poster was talking about.  Yeah, the service was a little slow, but the place was packed and who wants to be rushed through what is supposed to be a romantic dinner (well maybe if you are trying to break up or your date is boring . . .)

We live in NYC, eat at the finest restaurants in the world and are fierce critics of lousy food.  There were two choices for each of the four courses, and we ordered one of each, so we tasted literally everything on the menu that night.  We loved every bite.  Every dish was perfectly prepared and beautifully presented.

As far as the claim of racism, while I abhor the politics of Arizona, and would like to see Sheriff Joe Arpaio in jail, claiming that the staff of this place are racist is slanderous. I saw people of every different race and nationality enjoying their romantic dinners together, and there was absolutely no difference in how they were served.

Sounds like someone just had a bad date.
