MdjIl105vqCYUGKFSUVytA I only purchased a appetizer here so my review might have some bias. I had the beef tartare which was nice and was a bit spicier than I had expected. However not the best beef tartare I've had in Toronto. The restaurant is cute inside trying to mimic France however it feels like it's missing something- they didn't quite nail the French vibe. Our server had a French accent which was a nice touch although she was most likely from Quebec. Not a very busy restaurant though so the atmosphere here is just okay. I'd like to come back to try the brunch some day but dinner I would skip to be honest, the menu wasn't very enticing.
