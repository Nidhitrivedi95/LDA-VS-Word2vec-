gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA The two stars is purely for the view, which is simply fantastic; and for the service, which was delightful (servers were polite and attentive)

We were here with the Travelzoo voucher, and I'd say the food was abysmal. Frankly, lunch earlier that day at Grand Lux Cafe in the Palazzo was leagues better and cost less than half the price.

Firstly, the 'free' cocktail that came with the set came in a cheap plastic glass, and was so watered down that neither of us finished more than half. The food was equally bland - tasteless, not very fresh, and frankly, difficult to stomach. I really did not know if they were saving the truly good food for people who paid full price for the tasting menu, or if the restaurant really sucked. Truly, even a great chef would not serve disgusting food even if it was a discounted set. It was really hard to believe that the place had a michelin star in 2008 and 2009.

Again, the only reason why this does not get 1 star was because of the phenomenal view (ask to sit by the windows when you place a reservation), and the service. (they say 'voila!' and serve you your plates with a flourish!) Having said that, i would not visit this restaurant again.
