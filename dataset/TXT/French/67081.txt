USleI8g1UVN9-9jm-b4uIg The restaurant was wonderful, but our server did not make this a blissful birthday dining experience.  Do we fault the restaurant or the server (who didn't even tell us his name)?  Unfortunately, the server is part of the entire experience and his lack of attention and uncomfortable recitation of the specials was only the beginning.  Did he have too many tables?  Did we look too young?  Was he new?  Our appetizer never made it to the table and his response as our entrees were set down was that he "must have forgotten to write it down."  Excuse me sir, but you didn't write anything down.  No other comments were made by the waiter on this subject.

Everything we put in our mouths was delish.  The roasted garlic spread we lapped up with only forks after we finished our bread and devoured the spinach salads with a quail egg and warm bacon maple dressing.  The elk was decadent in the Bearnaise sauce and the hearty portion of ostrich steak was cooked perfectly.  

I believe strongly in customer service and this waiter just didn't have the over the top feel you would expect from a restaurant of this perceived quality.  I recommend the restaurant and the food for a high end dining experience, but not the waiter.
