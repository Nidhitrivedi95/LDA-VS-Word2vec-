HL6ZzGF7V-KDaU0zziHyEA This was our bougie dinner choice of our trip to Montreal and it was also my first time doing a tasting menu! Maison Boulud, from Chef Daniel Boulud, really made a lasting impression on me. We had an 8pm reservation, and were seated out on the patio overlooking the pond area - really cute!

The tasting menu is 6 courses, and the chef takes in any dietary restrictions/dislikes and sends out the courses. There is no set menu. We came in pretty hungry, and I did worry that we might leave hungry - but we left so stuffed! Some of my favorite dishes was the handmade gnocchi with lobster, the arancini amuse bouche, and the tuna tataki with clams. We also had several desserts - chocolate souffle was delicious and so was the passionfruit tartlets!

Service was truly excellent. Our meal took about 3 hours so you definitely just sit and eat and get full to the max. We couldn't even finish our desserts! Beautiful hotel and space, would definitely recommend!
