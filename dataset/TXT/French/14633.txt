5fquJHY2hMX9tPRD5s0t5g You ever sit down after eating at a restaurant and think to yourself, 'That might be it. That might very well be the best meal I have had in my entire life'? Well, that's how I felt after finishing my coconut cake at Rooster's. If I chose to starve myself after this meal, resulting in my death, I hope they make mention on my tombstone that my last meal was at Rooster's. I will have died happy if that's the case. I was in town with some friends for a little getaway in Charlotte and each one of us rolled out of this place with the biggest smiles on our faces. We tried the sampler, split mac & cheese, and mashed potatoes. My buddies had steak, pork shoulder, and I had the ribs. I will make a trip back to this place someday. You have my word. Absolutely fantastic.
