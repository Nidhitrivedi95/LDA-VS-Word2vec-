i2dnic7VdQ3NyiQQWUXHbA Phenomenal meal! I had the roti (which tastes like a latke topped with salmon). It was so incredible! My husband had the chicken and waffles, which he said was good, but he didn't rant or rave as nearly as much as I did. Very cute restaurant right across the street from Atwater market. Nice service and ambiance.
