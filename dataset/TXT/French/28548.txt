ehRigNzlkRQlvhzKr7PLCQ 2.5 stars really. It was very basic food. Frozen fries. No flavor in the burrito. But I guess whatdya want for $10? The service was good and quick. The space was cute enough; odd that there was no ambient music on so it felt kinda quiet and unwelcoming. Have a nice looking patio. There were paper and crayons on the table, so that was fun. The logo is hard to read--too small and busy, hard to see from the street. Great concept however that I want to support.
