mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q Service was outstanding! The reason for 3 stars is the price point for the quality of steak.  Girlfriend had a tenderloin that just melted and was seasoned perfectly had no problem with the $78 for such a great steak.  On the other hand I ordered the ribeye and really had no taste to it.  I think the Waffle House steak for $9.95 had the same flavor as this cut of meat.  Definitely should have done the tenderloin!  All in all a good dining experience while visiting Vegas.
