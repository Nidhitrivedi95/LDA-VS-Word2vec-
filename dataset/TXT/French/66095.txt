UFtVchZr4uRl8TtTe9WxZw The crepes here are really fantastic.  I had a mushroom, bechamel sauce and asparagus crepe and by the time I was done I was swirling my finger around the plate so I could get every last calorie into my body. So yummy.  

We also ordered french fries but they never came. By the time we finished our crepes we were so full we were sort of happy about the mess up so we didn't mind.  

The waitress was also lacking in that she never returned to our table and we practically had to send out smoke signals to get a check.   We had also planned to have another drink but since she never came back that was a no go too.  Even with the bad service I'd go back without any hesitation.
