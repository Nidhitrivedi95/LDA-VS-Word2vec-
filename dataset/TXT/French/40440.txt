KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA My boyfriend brought me here for a romantic evening.  We arrived a little early, and was immediately greeted with friendly smiles and a welcoming atmosphere, the hostess had saved a romantic table for us, but as we were a little early, it was not ready yet. The place was pretty packed, which meant all the waiters were busy.  At this point the sweet hostess jumped forward to clean the table herself, our spot was right at the edge of the deck, so we had an amazingly gorgeous view.

The waiter was very nice and attentive, unfortunately they were out of foie gras and duck, so instead we ordered escargot as an appetizer, a veal chop for myself and filet mignon for my other.  The escargot was a little bland, although the garlic butter sauce was quite heavenly with some bread.  The veal was a little dry around the crust, but overall good, the gnocci and mushrooms it came with was tasty.  And his filet mignon was amazing, perfectly cooked, tender, with au gratin potatoes and asparagus.  Mmmm.....

Bread pudding for dessert, they use a rum based sauce instead of the typical whiskey, it made for a subtle, not overly sweet flavor that I decided I preferred.

Overall it made for a great night.
