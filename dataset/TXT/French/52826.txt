QD0gnPAdy7w2vZZG9I41Sw We had purchased coupons via groupon (65$ for 2 persons, instead of 120$), and was glad to have done so; we got a cocktail, entrée, main dish and surprise dessert. The experience was truly one of a kind, as the waitstaff are all blind and you eat in the dark. The staff was very friendly and we had a great time. The only thing I would have changed were the portions of the meal, which were on the small side - I would not have gone without the coupon. 

Note: You need to order your meal and drinks before entering into the dinning room, so plan ahead for what you'll be wanting throughout your meal (water, wine etc) as they will not offer refills or extras after you're seated.
