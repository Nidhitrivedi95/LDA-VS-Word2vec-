The pastry looked amazing but I wasn't there for the buttery, flakey croissants, the eclairs, or other delectable treats. I wanted a loaf of crusty, airy spelt flour bread. I wasn't disappointed. Besides all the treats you'd be served at a French cafe, they also serve up some pretty mellow and smooth coffee. My only beef, just like any business on Butler Street, the parking is ridiculous.
