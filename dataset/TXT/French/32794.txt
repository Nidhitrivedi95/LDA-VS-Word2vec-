h_ypoQ2rmwX8UGSmohsGiQ My first time getting my morning coffee at Maman...they charge extra $0.50 for lactose free milk!!! Is like I am being punished for being lactose intolerant. The lactose free milk is not that much more expensive. Charging each client an extra $0.50 for lactose free milk is a little steep. When buying lactose free milk in the store I pay extra $ 0.50 for 2L of milk. The coffee was okay for the price they charge....nothing special about it.
