HOev_2CifUcfIm9xDL_uaw I chose to give one star because this restaurant failed in all aspects.  Service was mediocre at best.  The chicken pesto panini was over toasted, the chicken was bland, tomatoes not close to ripe and zero pesto flavor. The tomato soup was over heated, no body and no flavor. Epic Fail.

Food Guy Out!
