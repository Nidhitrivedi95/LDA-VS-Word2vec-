Vkl5QgIfpi6fS-Xox1EOug Les Enfants Terribles at its core is a great restaurant. The menu is nicely varied, the food is delicious...when it arrives at a reasonable time and in the correct order. I've had great and mediocre experiences here, mostly around the services unfortunately. Its either the food arrives way too late, the order is wrong or the waiter/waitress is so-so on the professional side. That being said when it works, it works very well. Worth a shot, especially in summer with that fantastic view and great terrace.
