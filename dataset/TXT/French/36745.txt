IE-FSNn9Zx9YFx3nJV4C1A Very pleasant atmosphere in downtown Montreal. The staff was welcoming and the food was delicious. We ordered the foie gras and goat cheese creme brulee as apps and they were both great, but the foie gras was a favorite! I ordered the sea bass with squid ink ravioli for my main dish -- the sea bass proportion was rather small, but very tasty. I didn't care for the ravioli but it was definitely worth a try! Overall, it was a great start to our vacation in Montreal.
