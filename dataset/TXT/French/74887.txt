Xw50tINqzrI_BM_x7_IcZA I've been here a few times because their crepes are amazing! I've tried two, both of which I loved enough to come back for. Along with the crepes, the atmosphere is also very important to me. This is a little French cafe where you can sit down and just relax while conversing with friends. You can practice speaking French with the owner, which is a change from all the other cafes that I have visited in Toronto. I am giving it 4 instead of 5 stars because it is a little expensive to me.

I tried:
1. Champagnarde: 9/10. 
2. Côte d'Azur: 9/10.
