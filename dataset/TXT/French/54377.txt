rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw We ordered duck confit, escargot, onion soup, pork chop and steak. The food was good but to me a bit over seasoned and salty overall.  But the service was great.  I was eating pork chop which was slightly over cooked and the server brought a new one even before I tell them so! What a detailed oriented service.
