fFInb4Dl2Ix4iE-VOltbkQ Great experience, the appetizers were great especially the stuffed calamari and the foie grad poutine...on the mains, the Guinea fowl and the braised pork were the best, with the stuffed lamb taking third place...the lobster tortellini rocked as well!  Would definitely come again!
