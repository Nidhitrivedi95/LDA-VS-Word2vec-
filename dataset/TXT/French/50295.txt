ovtlrcsVRlgZZQUlHs_ovw I had a large party, we were there from like 7 till 10 our waitress checked on us 4 times. We sat w water glasses in front of us for 30 minutes before we got asked if we would like drinks. Horrible experience. Filet minion was on point tho. Service sucks. Oh and one of my guest was never greeted at the door. Stood  there for 20 minutes before she walked out.  Never again vogue bistro.
