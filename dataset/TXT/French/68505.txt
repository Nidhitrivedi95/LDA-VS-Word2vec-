vLkKorA1gPS97Zj0_WKA0Q I went here with five other folks and I was unimpressed with my dishes. I will say that my most of my friends enjoyed their meals however most of them got steaks.

I got seafood dishes for entrees and so did one other person in our party and we both thought our meals were over cooked. I got the lobster and my friend got the fish. Each was a little rubbery. For a dish that costs 70 dollars it should be perfect. 

My appetizer was also subpar. I got a sort of Thai fish cake soup and although I will admit the soup was good I thought it was a tad over salted and lacked complexity. And the fish cake leaned heavily on needed the soup for any flavor as it was completely bland on its on.

We also got a few bottles of wine. One we had to send back because it had turned. The restaurant staff and our server in particular balked at our claim that the wine was bad. But we had a man in our group that was from the region in France that the wine comes from and knows the man who makes the wine in France. He knew that the wine wasn't supposed to taste this way. If it had just been me I might have backed down lacking the confidence in my knowledge of wines to confront the server or sommelier at the restaurant.

The rest of the time though the staff was very nice and the service was great. The server even brought me a side dish or gnocchi which I liked.

I would imagine that a 1200 dollar dinner for six would be better than what we got. Maybe my expectations are too high but then again I can remember meals that have been worth that. This meal just didn't make the cut.
