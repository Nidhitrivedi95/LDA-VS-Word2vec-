eUjDWzbQ6eLZy0uELEOa9Q Oh dear.  I'd love to go back to Boiler House to give it a second chance, since it has generally received good reviews, and the atmosphere is truly lovely.  That being said, however, my first visit -- for a work dinner with about 8 people -- was fairly disastrous.  It started off well -- we ordered a few bottles of wine and the servers seemed very attentive about keeping our glasses topped off.   We were served an amuse-bouche as well.  The restaurant didn't seem particularly crowded that night, but as the minutes dragged on and we waited and waited and waited for our food, it became a fairly excruciating experience.  When our food finally arrived, more than half of the dishes were actually cold.  I had made the mistake of ordering the butternut squash gnocchi, which was essentially a gelatinous orange stick plopped on top of a pile of tired-looking leeks.  Needless to say, I was not impressed.  The staff was apologetic and comped us a bottle of wine, but it didn't entirely take the bad taste out of my mouth.

However, my hard-to-please colleague ordered the rib eye, and he was thrilled with it.  I'm willing to give Boiler House the benefit of the doubt, but since I'm only in Toronto a couple of times a year, the likelihood that I'll return is slim to none.
