31KfCljxlb6zRS8r00lm2w While visiting Montreal we took the big red bus tour with the specific point of getting off at Oratoire Saint-Joseph du Mont-Royal.  As we were approaching the Oratory, our tour guide suggested Duc de Lorraine and we are grateful she did.

It's simple and casual atmosphere, but the food is excellent.

The three of us enjoyed a croque monsieur, croque madam and a baguette saumon along with small salads.  Each was simple, but as classic and wonderful as anything we had while in Paris a couple years ago. 
They clearly take their time, know their ingredients and know how to prepare these dishes.
While there, we saw many locals from the neighborhood gathering, which was a good sign.

Following lunch we were talked into trying three of their pastries, and Opera, Chocolate Eclair and an Eclair Chantilly.

Along with a latte and cappucino.. they were delicious.

Duc de Lorraine will definitely be on our list to visit again when we're back in Montreal.  It's a ways out of the city, but worth the trek, to be sure.
