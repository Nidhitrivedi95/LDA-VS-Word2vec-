xsFJZu4nME615byZVrpMGA Absolutely delicious. Gorgeous decor and interior. I was here with someone in the even around lunch time and it was the perfect place to go for a classy quick bite. Walking in, we didn't know what to expect but this is a full-service cafe style establishment so just go in, grab a seat and they will come to you.

------About the service------
5/5 fantastic waiters. Very professional and courteous; only checking in to see how everything was doing and was extremely polite. Tip them well ! 

------About the food------
My first intent when searching for a place to eat was something that would not be heavy on the stomach. This fits the criteria very well, and then some. We ordered the avocado salad and the quinoa salad. Both were fantastic and refreshing. I ordered the quinoa and she ordered the salad (which is more refreshing in my opinion.) They also had a wide range of espresso drinks, all looked good but I went with the chai coffee (5/5). Very hot to pick up but no regrets. They provide you with extra sugar but they made it perfectly anyway so none was needed.

Overall, a nice place to chit chat/relax on a lunch break or even a lazy sunday. Would come back again in a heartbeat.
