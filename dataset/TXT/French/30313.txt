FRuuIDOd21pTJHvEGIt1Gg Disappointing dinner. Pre-circus outing with my 17 year old daughter. Service was excellent, but steak frites and fish and chips were super bland. Fish tasted like the frozen kind baked in the oven. Steak was tough and tasteless. Appetizers - octopus salad and buffalo mozzarella were good. Room is very nice, but ambience is only half the battle.
