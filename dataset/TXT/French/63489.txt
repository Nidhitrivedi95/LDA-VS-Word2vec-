t1mR_Zff6Dqv1TueE2JLEA It was our first time having Moroccan food and we enjoyed it. The appetizers were great. We had the hummus and pita and the chickpea salad. I loved the chickpea salad and the hummus. The pita was over cooked so it was hard and too crunchy - we just avoided it. For the main, we had the vegetable tagine and the chickpea tagine. The chickpea tagine wasn't on their lunch menu but I asked the waiter and he said they would make it for us. I preferred the flavour of the vegetable tagine, but both were good. The tagines came with cold pita pieces, which should have been heated up a little bit so that they're easier to eat. Or maybe that's just how they always serve the pita with tagines. The cold pita was better than the overcooked pita for sure. 

For dessert, we got the chocolate tart and the creme brulee. We didn't like the creme brulee at all. It was in a tiny little container and it tasted only like I was eating sugar. The chocolate tart was delicious though.

We enjoyed the performance as well. The dancer was very talented and she seemed to be having fun.
