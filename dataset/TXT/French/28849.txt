el-3IdlW3bTCSnquLvH-3w What a treat this place is!  The husband/wife team have created a little gem in the desert. From the warm goat cheese salad,($9) to my crepe élysées ($10) and my husband's raves about the beef bourgignone (the most expensive thing on the menu at $22) we left happy!  Oh, and took home a lemon tart since we didn't have room for more - also so lemony and fresh.  You can taste everything is fresh and made right there. We can't wait to return and try the lunch offerings. They've only been open a short time, so we really wish them well!
