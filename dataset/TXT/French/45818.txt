Las Vegas has some fine restaurants and this is definitely one of the BEST we've been to. We secured bar seats which overlooked the open kitchen. The decor is elegant, modern and very chic with strong hints of black and reds. The service was impeccable. They really have it together here. 

Here is the rundown of our amazing meal: 

L'AMUSE-BOUCHE 
Foie gras parfait with port wine and parmesan foam 

*First time foie gras-er and WOW! so good! 

LES LEGUMES 
Mediterranean vegetables layered with buffalo mozzarella 

*Beautiful dish. the flavors of the veggies and the mozzarella meshed so well together. very very good. 

LA SAINT-JACQUES 
Scallop cooked with seaweed butter, curried cauliflower 

L'ONGLET 
French-style hanger steak with fried shallots with Pommes Purée. 

*WOW. melt in your mouth steak. one of the most tender cuts I have ever had. 

LES TARTES

Every course was cooked perfectly. This place is the BEST. Hands down. You totally get what you pay for and it is so worth spending the dough you need here. 

I recommend making a night of this. Do not plan on catching a show afterwards. You don't want to rush through this experience. Give yourself at least 2-3 hours here to truly enjoy this dining experience. You won't regret it. We will definitely return.
