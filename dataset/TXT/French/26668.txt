Da6eZFThE9xanUAGNpZxAg My husband and I came here on a Friday night and the food and drinks were definitely a hit. Initially, we were seated inside the restaurant, but given the beautiful weather, we requested for the patio. The patio was situated at the back of the restaurant and was small and cozy. We both love charcuterie boards and were quite happy with the selections available. The salami was fantastic with the right amount of salt and fattiness. The smoked prosciutto was flavorful and the apple butter was simply delicious. Overall, we found the charcuterie board to be good value at $17 with a choice of 5 meats ($1 surcharge for the bresola - personally, we preferred the other selections). We also tried an Italian olive, which was meaty and not salty. For the small plates, we ordered the arancini, octopus and kale salad. Of the 3 dishes, I enjoyed the octopus the most. It was very tender and the tomato sauce was tasty. The arancini was a bit flat flavour wise, but it was still a decent dish. And the Parmesan cheesecake at the end was to die for. It was decadent and had the right amount of sweetness. With good food and service, we will definitely return!
