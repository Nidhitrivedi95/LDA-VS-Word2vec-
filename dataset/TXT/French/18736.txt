AHosGBveeXx9YjsQvdJgeg What an amazing view, this was my first time here.  I was surprised how accommodating they were, my friend has an amazing taste for food.  They created her a special dish out of the items she said she liked.  It was amazing!!!I had the bourban filet...I haven't had a steak in years, this was amazing.  From the food to the atmosphere to the wait staff everything was fabulous...I can't believe I have lived here just over a year and this is my first time here...it will not be my last!!!
