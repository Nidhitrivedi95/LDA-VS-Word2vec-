The food at these kinds of restaurants is always stellar and unforgettable. I have to say that the dish that stood out was the one he recommended strongly - the rabbit. It was like comfort food to the tenth power. This dish had very warming flavors that cover the tongue with a blanket of savory-ness. *thinking about it right now*

Oh and they also served a raspberry champagne concoction that I loved. 

My father ordered a chocholate desert and when they serve it they pour hot liquid chocholate on top of this chocholate bowl and it melts a hole in the top - just very cool presentation that I had to mention.

Aside from this the atmosphere is not typical. I love the dim lighting mixed with the colorful patterns surrounding. 

There are simply so many excellent restaurants in Vegas to choose from and if you value excellent service paired with awesome food and atmosphere - I would recommend this. Oh and we went here right before going to see Cirque Du Soliel so it was very fitting.
