4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Mon Ami Gabi is a great spot for a nice dinner.  Not quite upscale like the Eiffel Tower restaurant but still a decent place for a meal.  Most will recognize Mon Ami Gabi for being "that sidewalk cafe at Paris".  Yup, that place.

The wait can get a little long, so you may want to call ahead or put your name down and gamble for a bit.  Thankfully, we didn't have to wait long since we called ahead and were seated promptly.  The staff was very nice and filled our waters without being asked.  

The hanger steak was very flavorful and cooked just as requested.  I don't know if it was the alcohol or what, but I loved the steak and it was easily one of the best steaks I've had.  I've never had "frites" before (think regular french fries but thinner and less greasy) and they complimented the steak famously.  After a couple martinis and the meal, we finished our meal by enjoying a strawberry crepe.  Not the best I've ever had, but still very tasty and enjoyable.

I wouldn't hesitate to visit Mon Ami Gabi again.
