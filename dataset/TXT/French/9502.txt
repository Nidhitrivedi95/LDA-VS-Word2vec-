4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I made reservations for my Boyfriend's Birthday  for 8 pm and we both enjoyed it! They promptly sat us down at the Pavilion, which is where you can see the fountain show from the Bellagio, which is right in front. I had requested this seating area upon arrival and they made sure to find us a seat there. Thank you!

Dinner- it was delicious, my boyfriend had the New York Steak and I had the Lobster Roll (which they only do for Lunch not dinner, but I asked if they had it and they still had some) with fries which were delicious.

Drinks- I had a Sangria and it was very good! I was Happy!, My Boyfriend had a Burboun kind of drink (not for me).

The experience was one of a kind. The server was very attentive and very helpful, she even remember it was my BF birthday and brought him an ice cream cake pastry with a candle lit and ready to blow. Thank you! I didn't have to tell her she just did it. I had a coffee and it was very tasty as well.

Overall we had a wonderful Birthday Dinner. Never felt rushed to leave or hurry up to sit other people. You can actually enjoy your dinner and see the fountain show. We would definitely go back.
