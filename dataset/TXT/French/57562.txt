rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Eleven of my girlfriends and I went to Bouchon for a lovely bachelorette pre-party dinner.  I canceled our reservation at the last minute because, in that ever important debate, "food vs sleep," sleep won the first round.  Bouchon gave us the flexibility to cancel last-minute without any penalties.  Nice.  However, ultimately, our stomachs won the battle and we decided that we were more hungry than tired.  So I called Bouchon and asked if we could head over (like, now) without any reservations and, again, they were extremely gracious and flexible and, not only took all of us ASAP but, also gave us a private room without our requesting it.  Now we could be as loud and obnoxious and Miss Piggy as we wanted to be.  

Our waiter was fantastic - sweet, offbeat, patient, helpful, quirky, funny.  Huge tip for him.  The bread was excellent - excellent presentation and warm.  The main courses and dessert - hmm.  Maybe I was expecting a lot more since I've heard such great things about Bouchon (and, of course, we all know Bouchon is owned by the owner of French Laundry in Napa) - but, honestly, the food was TOO DAMN BUTTTERY.  I don't care if this is French food and it's supposed to be fatty.  You know something is wrong when all I can smell in the air, in my hair, in our food, is butter.  Now, my girls and I can EAT.  Oink, oink, baby.  But, because of all the butter in the food, not one of us could finish her meal.  NOT ONE.  That is a downright shame.  I was disappointed by the trout I had ordered.  I've had much, much better trout - even trout prepared in a similar fashion - in Europe, in restaurants that were NOT fine dining establishments, just casual gastropubs.  I can't believe I am saying this but, the meal would have been much better if the portions had been smaller - less butter and less of that buttery aftertaste.  Also, it would have helped if the desserts were at least orgasmic but, alas.  This is what we ate:
- Watercress & Endive salad
- Mixed green salad
- Bibb Lettuce salad 
- Pan-roasted trout w/ almonds
- Atlantic Salmon with black cabbage
- 2 different specials of the day (scallops, steak)
- Lemon tart
- Dark Chocolate Mousse
- Pot de Crme

The salads were so-so.  The main courses - 'nough said above.  The desserts - good but, definitely not spectacular.  

Would I go back?  I'd return to Bouchon for breakfast/brunch but, probably, not for dinner.  :(
