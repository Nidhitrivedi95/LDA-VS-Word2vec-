O66Zy8Y13VBm72ZDhS4fIg I went to this place with a party of 18 for a birthday. It was nice because before we went, the birthday girl was able to choose a prix fixe menu. She was able to make changes to the menu to cater to our groups needs. 

The prix fixe menu was $75/person, which is more on the expensive side. However, the food did not disappoint. 

Appetizers: I ordered the wild boar terrine, which started out cold and salted, but ended pleasantly sweet with a red currant geleé. Some others raved about the salad, which they stated had many dimensions. I also tasted the red lentil and carrot soup with pistachio cream, which was rich and savoury. 

Entrees: I had the Cornish hen with quinoa and double smoked bacon, which was rich and fantastic. My fiancée had the lamb and mushroom risotto, which I had 1/2 of and it was also fantastic. Rich, creamy, and with perfect texture. I also had the NY striploin, which was cooked to perfection and was very good. 

Dessert: I had the Apple Bread pudding and sour cream ice cream. I recommend this dish any day of the week. It was very rich with a brandy caramel that you pout over your own dish. Others had the chocolate lava cake, which was good, but paled in comparison to the apple pie.

Service: we were serviced by a waiter named Gio, who was caring, informative, and very quick with service. I felt like he paid special attention to us, but he was frequently serving other tables, which shows that he is a very dedicated waiter. He made a mistake with a wine when I reordered, giving us a more expensive bottle, but when I brought it to his attention he adjusted the bill in our favour. That was nice. 

Drinks: The wine was fairly priced, but if you are ordering scotch or hard liquor, know that it's going to cost you. 2 double Glenlivet Scotches cost $96.
