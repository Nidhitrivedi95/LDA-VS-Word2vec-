rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w This is one of the best dining experiences I have ever had. I went here on an anniversary for dinner and had the prix fixe menu with wine paring. Better than my experience at Aqua in San Francisco...Everything was excellent and the wine paring is a must. Of course this place is a splurge, but is what the definition of fine dining is in every aspect, food, service (even though the somalier wasn't all that friendly) atmosphere, wine, A++
