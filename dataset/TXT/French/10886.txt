4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Searched on-line for best Eggs Benedict and this place was mentioned. Seeing as we were already guests of the Paris, we figured this to be a no brainer.

We were wrong. My poached eggs were like golf balls. Bearnaise sauce was brushed on, and the English Muffin was hard as a rock. It's fairly obvious these were pre-made and probably being stored in a hot box or chafing dish somewhere else. I'm guessing they just pulled them from the buffet line from Le Village Buffet. I've been through enough Sunday Brunch lines to know this is what happens when you place Eggs Benedict in a chaffing dish.

I should have complained and sent them back for something else but I did not have any confidence in the kitchen at that point. Plus we had to get to the airport.
