nLiOl95RBCVswpe7wYpUww I love this second cup. By far one of the nicest little coffee places I've been to here. Love the Chai latte with the biscotti. Great selection. (Same as a regular second cup I agree but the ambience makes it so much nicer!)

The staff is super an there is a fireplace.... Seriously this is def one of the more cozy and nicer places to have a coffee.
