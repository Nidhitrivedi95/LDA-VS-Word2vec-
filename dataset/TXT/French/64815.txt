teTQU7TIPE0O_B1zN_239w Went to mesa location Fri evening. Our waitress was not not friendly, our food tasted like it came out of a bag or can, and the restrooms were filthy. 
The young hostess was very pleasant.
The french onion soup was tasty and the ice tea was cold. The meatballs, shrimp scampi, specialty sandwich and table bread were very mediocre.
