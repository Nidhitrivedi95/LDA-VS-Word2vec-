ZV7t55UEx1LnBOWqTrutSw A great experience with this farm to fork restaurant. The food was very fresh and menu appear limited to what was fresh for the day. Cocktails and wine selections were delicious. The appetizer and entree menu has a limited 5-6 selections. We had the duck and venison which were cooked perfectly. Soft shell crab and beef carpaccio were a great appetizer. Service was friendly and attentive. Would definitely come again and recommend to my friends that want to try food that is unique. Desserts were on point. A great food experience overall!
