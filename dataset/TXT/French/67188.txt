USleI8g1UVN9-9jm-b4uIg The best food I have had in Charlotte, HANDS DOWN!  Interesting, exciting and delish food combinations. I would HIGHLY recommend the seabass and the dessert (omg) hazelnut chocolate torte....ugh, so good! The food was incredible and the service was second to none. I called ahead letting them know that a member of my party was celebrating a birthday and they went above and beyond to make it feel special (in a discrete way of course). The atmosphere is warm and inviting set in a renovated home it felt very cozy. And parking was very easy. I will definitely be heading back as soon as possible.
