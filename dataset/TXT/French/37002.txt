in3zjiaLpNzr9G3K35gAJQ I mean , wow.  Tiny little spot behind the main 'fancy' restaurant and what a steal!  Absolutely delicious food and very affordable.  I opted for a prixe fixe course and it was delicous.  Butternut squash soup, which was rich and creamy; the lamb was absolute perfection and delicious.  Pink in the middle, but seared perfectly on the outside. Lastly, the profiteroles were delicous. Overall this was an excellent restaurant that I will definitely visit many more times to come.
