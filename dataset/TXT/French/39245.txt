JsAjP49bCk9KjJmmmjyM4w What more can I say about Clafouti that hasn't already been said? Their croissants are the best on the Queen West strip, in my humble opinion. I've heard Patachou has the best Parisian-style croissants in the city but they're a little far for me to make the trek. Thanks to geography, Clafouti is my main go-to whenever I crave flakey, buttery goodness. 

Clafouti also has an excellent selection of homemade breads, and I will sometimes buy a baguette or one of their multi-grained loaves - if you're lucky enough to grab one before they sell out! 

But it's their croissants that make me a return customer. Plain, with chocolate, filled with fruit or acting as a sandwich, their croissants pull me into this little shop each time I'm in the neighbourhood. Nothing is more satisfying to me than waking up on a beautiful morning, buying a fresh croissant and dipping it into my cafe au lait, whilst sitting in Trinity-Bellwoods Park. Simply heaven.
