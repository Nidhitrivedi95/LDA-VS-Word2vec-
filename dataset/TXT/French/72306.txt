XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q Among all the great restaurants in Vegas, this is definitely the best.  The atomosphere is relaxing with chic black decor.  The food is excellent.  All the dishes look like demo from TV top chef cooking show.. most important... not only looking good but tasting great..The dessert is far and above anything you can expect.  Try it.  You won't regret a penny you spend there.
