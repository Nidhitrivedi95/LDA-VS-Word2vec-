Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA Hands down, one of the best meals I've ever had. The $90 prix fixe menu was incredible and worth every penny. 

Our server, Randy, only made the meal that much better. You could tell he works as a server, but he's a chef in his own right. He did an awesome job accommodating us, considering I got the prix fixe menu and my mom had an entree and side. He timed it right and was extremely knowledgeable about all the food.

Every single thing on the prix fixe menu was amazing. Every item was unique enough to make me think, and though I probably wasn't able to fully appreciate the presentation, it slapped me in the face with flavor I couldn't misunderstand. The lamb dish was the best I've ever had. Dessert kept coming...3 items that were ridiculously good!

My mom had the cod and it was a huge portion with unbelievable flavor. She had a $9 side with the cod ($36) and it was plenty of food. These prices are REASONABLE when you're on the 64th floor of Mandalay Bay.

BONUS
Randy took the time to explain that MIX is one of the few restaurants in Vegas that actually serves PRIME beef, pastured meats, and most everything is organic. There are plenty of other places on the strip with prices this high and lower quality food so don't be fooled into thinking these prices are ridiculous. They're just not.
