4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw My wife and I dined here tonight. We had a great time. The food was great and we were fortunate to sit outside to view the Bellagio fountain. However, we had to wait an additional hour to get outdoor seating even though we had a reservation for 8:45pm on a Wednesday. Reservations are only for indoor seating and outdoor seating is first-come first serve.

Complimentary french bread was served before our meals came out. It tasted freshly baked and it was a plus that it came out hot.

I had the steak bordelaise and my wife had the special for the night. It was braised short ribs with mashed potatoes dressed with olives. She also ordered a carrot based soup as an appetizer. The meals were excellent and the portion sizes were large.  An excellent value for about $25 per dish.  The soup was $8 and it was also a large helping. 

For dessert, we had the profiterole trio ($8) which includes vanilla, chocolate & strawberry ice cream over some kind of pastry topped with hot double chocolate fudge. The ice cream and fudge were delicious especially the vanilla. However, the pastry seemed a bit out of place in both taste and texture. All in all, the ice cream and fudge made up for the pastry. 

I recommend this place for great food at great prices. I also recommend getting a table outside if possible. I'm only giving this place 4 stars out of 5 because of the long wait for outdoor seating even with reservations.
