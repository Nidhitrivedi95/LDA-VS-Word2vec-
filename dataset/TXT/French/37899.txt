jaSowNITPRRCYpPb3_pjdA We are an insta fan! It's been a while since I have written a 5 stars review. We came to Andre's for early dinner today. We sat outside on the patio. The restaurant is chic, and tastefully decorated.

The service was really great. The waiter made sure our waters and cocktails/ drinks were filled. We ordered most of the items from the happy hour menu. Happy hour is from 3pm to 5.30pm. The menu is unique which I like. We had the Charcuterie Board, everything on it were really delicious. The escargot was really flavorful with  tons of garlic and butter. We also ordered Frog legs, although the batter was heavy, it was meaty. We ordered Andre's burger to take home. Don't forget to order the house cocktails, it was also delicious. The bill was about $87 and $104 with tips for a happy hour meal but it was worth it. 

Overall, the food portion was not small and the quality was excellent and so was the service and experience. We will definitely be back.
