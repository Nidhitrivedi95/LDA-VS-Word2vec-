Food: Meh

Some friends and I decided to do brunch here on Saturday, and I must admit that overall, the experience was good.  For starters, they allowed for a reservation on the weekend, which is always a big plus, and although this is the case, I'm not sure we would have needed one as the restaurant has a very large and nicely spaced out seating area.  The first thing i noticed when I walked in was the bar made out of what appeared to be white marble, which was spectacular.  The servers and staff were very courteous, attentive, and seemed generally happy throughout our whole experience.  Our table ordered a variety of different dishes, all of which were "ok".  I wasn't disappointed, but also not blown away.  I had the three cheese omelet, which I must admit is a bland dish to begin with, which was well prepared and nicely presented.  Some deserts were ordered as well, which were very well presented.  Overall, if you have friends in town and need a decent, accommodating brunch experience, this place shouldn't disappoint.
