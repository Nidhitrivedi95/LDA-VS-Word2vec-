Yp9w4nhUowBU_IS_StFXbQ This place is really cute! My friend and I went for breakfast around 9am and we made reservations. We didn't go in right away. The hosts advised us to wait a couple of minutes (we waited about 10). We sat down and the host gives me this mini chair to put my bag. I thought that was uberly cute! The table setting was nice and the server too. The atmosphere and the vibe- I'll give it a 5/5. 

Food:
My friend ordered the Spanish omelette and I ordered an item that was off the menu. I tried my friend's omelette and the Spanish omelette was rly good! It had a very interesting taste to it. I had a French toast and that was rly good too! The only reason I give a star down is because of the portion. The portion is a little small (maybe bc it's fine dining?). Other than the portion part this place is a must come! Also it's perfect spot for a brunch date!
