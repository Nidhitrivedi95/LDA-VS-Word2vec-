HiMb8cwGsnFVwYxt1h0RCg LOVE this restaurant! It's really amazing! Went twice and never got disappointed. The price is good for the portion and taste, and the restaurant is quite busy, so please reserve or you will need some luck to find a place at peak hours!
I tried their seafood pasta and it was HEAVENLY, their mozzarella sticks are also amazing! Brunch is not as good as supper but their mushroom and beef dish was really really impressive! Sum all, a big thump up for Tôt ou Tard!
