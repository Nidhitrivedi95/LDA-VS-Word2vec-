ysJo5Jdo29XOBCnKrbUKWg This was our go-to date restaurant. We have been here many times previously for dinner, always tipped generously, and spent well at this restaurant. Apparently they have decided they no longer want our business. 

Tonight we intended to celebrate our new engagement at Paris 66. We arrived tonight, a Saturday evening with crappy weather, around 7:15. The parking lot was empty, and so were most of the tables. The hostess, however, seemed to believe they were packed to the gills. She asked if we had a reservation, and when we said no, she said she couldn't get us in until 8:45. I was confused because we have been here many times before and never even needed to wait for a table-- never mind the fact that the restaurant was empty.

The hostess did not offer to let us wait to see if another reservation did not show, nor did she apologize for the inconvenience. We left and went to another of the many restaurants in the area. While there, I checked open table and there were reservations available at Paris 66 immediately. 

I really hope that this was a case of a clueless hostess and not some newly developed snobbishness regarding my fiancé's lack of shaving. Regardless, We need to find a new date restaurant.
