JezHN-9KKLTMbojq00VP0g I drove all the way from Kent as soon as I found out about this place and it was completely worth it! I ended up sharing an appetizer with my date, we each had a half salad, each had our own entree, and then split dessert for only $50! Although the interior of this place is rather hole in the wall, the food is phenomenal! I can't recommend this place enough for anyone that enjoys French cuisine!
