bzbNGyrTwWHAgg1CqkSgeg My family and I visited this place about a week ago for Father's Day, and we were expecting it to be really good from the pictures/reviews I saw, but it turns out it was overhyped.

To begin, I would lie to start with the service. Since it was Father's Day, we were expecting it to not be the greatest service, which is totally fine. However, our first server seemed to have no interest in us whatsoever, and he made some poor, overworked server take his place instead. Our service from this next server was decent, probably because she had so many tables to staff. Also, when our food arrived, we had no utensils on our table, and we waited a good five minutes before any utensils were brought to us (by the way, my Dad had to get up and find someone instead of just waiting even longer for our server to show up). 

Now for our mediocre food. Everything but the lemon poppyseed French toast was just "meh" food. I ordered the Bavarian creme French toast sticks, which sounded good, and they actually okay apart from the very oily taste from them being deep fried and there not being creme in the whole French toast stick. The other dishes we ordered that were just okay as well were the full breakfast and eggs Benedict. Not only was the full breakfast overpriced for what it was, but it did not come as ordered either. Not to mention, my dad got food poisoning from it as well (on Father's Day!:( )

Overall, the only good thing about this place was the lemon poppyseed French toast.
