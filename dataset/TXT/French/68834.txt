VQkrYJgDZIDsnaphQh1ZDw Ate here for breakfast in the hotel pretty much every day before starting out. They have an excellent breakfast buffet and fantastic coffee. After night after night of drinking and excess this nice place is a perfect start to another day in this beautiful city. If you just want something quick and dont want to leave the hotel, head down to the lobby and stop in here. It is good!
