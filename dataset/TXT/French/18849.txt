aM4pb4teV2Tr0Z-ZRt4icg I love macarons, but they are definitely not all created equally.  This little shop in Scottsdale Quarters fits the bill.  They offer interesting flavors such as cassis, earl grey, and rose, as well as more traditional flavors like chocolate, vanilla, coffee, etc.  I personally really like the cassis ones.   Besides the macarons, I would also recommend trying the violet flavored gelato.  It sounds strange, but it is really tasty.
