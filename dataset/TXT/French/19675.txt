aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw Bouchon Bakery, right off the bat, is a tough place to find! It's not located directly in the Grand Canal Shops of Venetian. Rather, it is located off the grid of the Grand Canal Shops at the end of a long line of other shops and high-end restaurants. 

It's a very small bakery. When I was there, there were only a few people there, so the line went fast. I got four macarons -- red velvet, chocolate, salted caramel, and pistachio.

The red velvet and chocolate were my favorites. The salted caramel and pistachio were okay, but they were too chewy and might have been chilled for a long time.

Other than that, the bakery itself was very quaint and cute. It offers other pastries as well, like cakes, croissants, danishes, and cupcakes. I would definitely come back here to try different goods!
