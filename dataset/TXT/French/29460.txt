f2w9rH1gFJ4GJDNq3hvVFw We LOVE this restaurant.  We love it so much we ate here twice in three days.  The curried octopus is amazing, as is the watercress soup and the sweet potato pie for dessert.  The prices are great, you'll never leave hungry, and Jean Pierre is a great host.  Remember to bring your own wine, and Jean Pierre will happily open it for you.  This place is such an amazing find we'll fly all of the way from San Francisco just to eat here again.  The spices are a mix from everywhere and the octopus melts in your mouth.
