xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g From 1 being horrible and 5 being awesome:

Food - 4
Service - 4
Price - 1
Scenery/View - 5

I only gave it a 2 because it was outrageously over priced.  The quality of food was good, but not something I would write home about.  You're paying for the ambience and view here, not for the food.
