XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q West of New York City, this is my favorite place to eat. You'll wish you had more room in your stomach to try a bit more of JR's truly grand cuisine and accompanying libations.

Eat a light lunch and be prepared for a long meal that's worth the time. It's within a full blown Vegas-style dining environment that showcases world-class modern French fare. Enter through the MGM's villas- arrange to be driven in via one of their gold limos if it's your first time.

You can pay almost as much in Napa, SF, LA, and other places in Vegas but I still haven't found another establishment that has quite matched up. (French Laundry is up there too of course, but it's substantively different in style).
