rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Second time here wasn't as good as the first.  I was hoping to see Chef Keller's legendary awesomeness at breakfast, but surprisingly came away disappointed.  

It was pretty spankin early for vegas standards, so my friend and I came here for breakfast.  It's set away from the casino, which makes it's a nice, relatively quiet place.  The sausages were great, but the crossiant was really greasy.  I mean it made my lips extra-shiny-greasy.  And the potato was very salty.  But the sausages were just that good that i overlooked most of the imperfections.  

It's a nice dining experience here and in the summer you can eat on the patio that overlooks one of the smaller, more private pools at the venetian (which i did last year).  One thing of note is that my friend felt uncomfortable with all the old men leering at her throughout our meal.  I think they thought i was taking my hooker to breakfast, but um, no that's not it.  Bouchon can't control that, but it did make her uncomfortable.
