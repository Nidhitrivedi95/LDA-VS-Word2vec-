4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Good times... prices decent, good for groups, friendly servers, prompt hosts... 

Now for the food... it was a pretty good steak... i ordered the NY with pomme frites med rare... Came out juuuust right... the meat was tender for a NY and flavorful. My friend oredered the filet mignon and that was even more tender, though hers was maybe a tiny teeny bit on the rare side.. but still really good and rather rare then over cooked! 

The mussels were great too!... lovely sauce and really fresh mussels. I can be picky about the freshness of mussels but it was great that night! Our whold group was very happy with their dinners.
