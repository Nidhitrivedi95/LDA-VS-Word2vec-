4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Coming here for many years and this is my first bad experience. The food was still great, but the service and the new policy of not allowing you to have a sample tasting of wine before ordering , spoiled my excitement about eating here again. We like to try different wines and the server interaction and suggestions about wine was always a highlight of the meal.
