JezHN-9KKLTMbojq00VP0g My first experience here wasn't a good one. I got the Pork shoulder and duck cassoulet and the cassoulet was inedible and after 2 bites we couldn't force ourselves to eat it. The pork shoulder was tender but the sauce was very bitter. I decided to give it another shot and the the second time I ordered the duck breast and chicken cream crepe. The duck breast was delicious and cooked perfectly, and crepe was good as well. I got the lemon curd crepe for dessert and it was one of the best I've had. I'd definitely recommend the crepes on the menu. The atmosphere is cute and just like the name the cafe is a small triangle shape. The place has fresh flowers on every table and it really does feel like you've escaped to France for an hour!
