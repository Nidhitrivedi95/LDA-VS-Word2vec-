BSmqxPbQglQwP2R56OqOag I dined in on Tuesday, and I had the spanish risotto. It was excellent! This was my first time, and when the complimentary dessert came to my boyfriend and me, I tried striking up a conversation with the female manager. Although the restaurant did not seem too busy, she made us feel like an inconvenience. We felt uncomfortable around her because of how she talked to us in such a degrading manner. AND SHE IS SUPPOSED TO BE A MANAGER? HOW CAN A PERSON BE A MANAGER AND NOT LET YOUR GUESTS FEEL WELCOME?! Bottom line, we did not feel appreciated as guests. What a shame when the food was so great... certainly we will not be returning, as well as letting others know about such POOR MANAGEMENT
