rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Awesome brunch.  Totally affordable consider you're in Vegas.  I got the salmon baguette and Howard got the Breakfast Americaine.  It was lots of food!!  Yummy bread and pastries.  My dish is a standard, but all very good.  Howard's, again standard, but done very well.  You think you're in a parisian bistro, it was wonderful Sunday brunch!
