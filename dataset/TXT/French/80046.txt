As usual, when my head is pounding with the repercussions of a crazy night,  I need to fuel up with high amounts of proteins. 

This is why you can't go wrong with the Full Irish breakfast plate which is rich in energy. The plate is super tasty with gaspor sausage,  eggs, back bacon (yummy), black pudding, piglet liver,  soda bread, a grilled tomato and potatoes. Needless to say all this  will fill you up big time and partially erase any hangover. 

Although full,  I'm a glutton and I had to satisfy my sweet tooth. I had remembered loving their scones back in the day. Although they weren't on the menu the waitress made them happen and OMG they are freaking deliciouuuuus! 

Love this place!
