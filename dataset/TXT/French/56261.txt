rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A We thoroughly enjoyed our meals.  We were able to walk in although we had a reservation.  The restaurant is a tad hard to find, but this has to be one of the best value meals we've had in years.

I had the Truite Grenobloise & the trout was cooked perfectly.  My wife had Steak Frites and enjoyed it very much.  Another person in our party had Côtelette de Porc and said it was excellent.  Among other items ordered was the Confit de Canard and it was very, very good.

The service was very good and we never waited for anything.  And, of course, I was very pleased with the cost of the meal; it was very affordable.
