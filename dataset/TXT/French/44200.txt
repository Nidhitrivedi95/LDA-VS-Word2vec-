ME6D5nLlfG0xZCtICOYDuw My fiancé and I finally committed to making the drive down here from our North side of town for my birthday.  I really enjoyed the town center it was in.  It set the tone, a classy atmosphere.  

The fried calamari here was fantastic.  It was well seasoned and cooked just right.  Really, the aoli sauce is what made the plate.  It had the perfect combination of flavor and spice.  

We followed up with Caesar salads.  The taste was pretty spot on, but the presentation was a bit much.  The crouton (one long one) was tough to break apart and the romaine was left long cut.  Maybe that's an authentic type thing?  I dont know, but I'll be the first to admit I'm not the most culturally knowledgeable person out there.  Either way, I prefer to eat my salad without having to use a knife.

My fillet minion was seasoned perfectly and the sauce for it was delicious as well.  It was slightly overlooked, a little closer to medium, as opposed to the mid rare I ordered.  Still, I will admit, the steak won me over.

The service was pretty solid, our waitress seemed very busy.  We had a great night at George's and for that we thank him.  Good stuff.
