ysJo5Jdo29XOBCnKrbUKWg I went to Paris 66 for brunch with my wife and some friends, and it was really excellent. My brunch combination included eggs Provencal, pain au chocolat, and a crepe with whipped cream and a berry sauce -- very simple, but very well executed. My wife said that her buckwheat crepe was a bit too rich, but I'll let her write her own review if she wants to give Paris 66 fewer stars. Also notable are the macarons. Lots of different flavors and all of those I've tried (raspberry, pumpkin, caramel, and pistachio) have been between good and fantastic. Finally, the service was quite good: they were friendly, attentive, and indulged us when we were indecisive.
