ZgiSgTwHOoxdfi0unI36Mg Went for a family New Year's Dinner on the first. The service was excellent, though we were in no hurry and had ample time between drinks, starter, main course, cheese course and dessert.  The Caesar salad was ample and not overdressed--surprisingly fresh given it was at the end of the holidays. The BBQ ribs were served a la haute cuisine with roast root vegetables under the rack of eight perfectly cooked, fall-off-the-bone pork short ribs. Presentation is a concern. Over all, the dining experience was great, like most hotel restaurants, though, it's no bargain.
