SFnrHuVFSNiondFVUBLJZQ Great ambiance.  Service was excellent and very informative.  Presentation was topnotch even for simpler dishes.  Soups are delicious.  Reasonable prices as well considering how expensive that area can be.

Servings might be small for overeating Americans but I liked it.  Some people are just used to seeing loaded up plates with extra food they don't even touch. 

The nutella crepes could've used more nutella so just ask for some on the side.

Hot cider and wine looked great but we didn't get a chance to try.
