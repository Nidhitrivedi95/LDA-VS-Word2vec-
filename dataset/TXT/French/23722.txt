cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg Bummed that this was our last dinner during our 4 nights in Montreal.  It was disappointing.  They were super busy and we did not get seated until 1 hr after our reservations.  Maybe this was the reason food was not so good.  We had:

- duck carpaccio.  Good but not great.  Couldn't taste the duck flavor.  Tasted like regular beef carpaccio.  

- venison tartare - ok but the huge mound of meat got boring since it just came with toasted baguette and salad.   Apparently it cane with fries too but we didn't get ours until 30 min later after we were done with our meal.  We tried a few and they were the worst fries ever.  Soggy, greasy and bland.  We were so surprised that a restaurant with this reputation would let something ghat bad come out of the kitchen.  

- duck in a can.  Too oily.  Duck was tough and hard to cut.  Foie gras was just okay and not melt in your mouth like other places.    We've had much better duck and foie gras for less.  The best thing was the red cabbage which gave the rich dish balance.

Service was horrible.  French waiter who rushed through menu items and we had to ask him what things were since menu is not descriptive and he didn't offer to explain anything.  He never returned to ask us how our meal was or if we wanted more wine.

We were there for a total of 2.5 hours and not by choice.  Go to Joe Beef instead.  We went there 2 nights earlier on a busy Friday night and found the food and service was executed very well and a better price point.
