4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw We visited this restaurant for brunch while we were on vacation in Vegas. I had read all the great reviews and let me say...it definitely lives up to those reviews! Our service was awesome....we got water right when we sat down and everything came out quickly. Every worker was very friendly. We had a reservation for 9 AM and were a little late, but were still seated right away despite how busy they were. The food was absolutely delicious and the prices weren't bad. I highly recommend this restaurant for brunch!
