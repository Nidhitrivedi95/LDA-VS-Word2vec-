4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw After doing my research for a more casual restaurant for a night out in Vegas, I settled on Mon Ami Gabi and was VERY excited to check it out based on all the very positive reviews.

I was sorely disappointed.

Our reservation was at 9PM and when we checked in was told they were running 10 minutes behind.  

We headed to the bar and once a free spot opened up, we tried to order a glass of wine.  We stood there for about 15 minutes before we were acknowledged.

At 9:20PM, I checked back in and was told we were the next party of two on the list.  After another 10 minutes our buzzer went off and I moved over to the reception desk and was told our table was not ready.  So we didn't sit for our 9PM reservation until well after 9:30PM but no big deal.

We sat and we greeted promptly.  Service at the table was great; the food was not.

I ordered the escargot which was average and the French onion soup which was not good.  It was very sweet and bland and there was hardly any cheese.  I was disappointed.  

Everything else food wise was ok.  My fiance got the filet with the red wine sauce, it was also very sweet.  The cheese platter appetizer had one really great bleu cheese, the other two cheeses were average.

Expected much more after all the stellar reviews.  I don't know if it was an off night or what.
