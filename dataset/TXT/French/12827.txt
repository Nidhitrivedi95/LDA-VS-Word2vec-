4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I ate here late night after an up night of gambling.  I ordered the following:

Filet Mignon
Seafood Platter
Skate Wing
French Onion soup

The steak didnt have much flava, even though it was cooked pretty nicely.  That means the meat was not AAAAA+, so veer away from that one.

The seafood platter was impressive.  It came with an entire lobster, oysters, shrimp, seaweed salad and tuna tartare.  The lobster doesn't come cracked, so prepare to get dirty.  This dish was $$$ but the lobster is def worth it.  My girl and her mommy loved the tuna tartare with big chunks of Ahi and Avo combo!

Sting ray you say?!  Aye mateeeee!  Def get this one.  The texture is like a more tender version of scallops.

French onion soup.  This one was in alot of the reviews and it was good.  Heavy on the cheese, and a hint of sweetness from the onions.  But $8 for a small bowl of soup?!  Better get lucky from the tables games then.
