SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ Honestly, I had heard so many rave reviews about this place and well I guess I expected a lot more.  I finally went for dinner.  

The ambiance is quite lovely.  If the weather is nice opt for outdoor seating rather than indoors.  The wait staff is lackadaisical.  I admit the scallop appetizer special was delicious however my main entree was tasty but definitely not stellar by any means.  Considering the prices I expected the entree dishes to be a little more hearty.  I am not giving up on this place completely but I may opt for lunch or happy hour the next visit.
