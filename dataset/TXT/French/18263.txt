A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g After seeing so many reviews and pictures of this place, I had to try it out for myself. It's a 5 minute drive from work, which may not be a good thing for my diet. My first visit was with my mom, who happened to be in town. We decided to split a small ham and cheese croissant and a dutch apple tart. We ordered 2 coffees as well. When i took the first bite of that croissant I was taken aback at how many different buttery layers of crusty goodness it contained. It was literally perfection on a plate. It had a mild melted cheese balanced with a sweet savory ham and it took my breath away. We both looked at each other marveling at the taste. I couldn't believe how good this little $2.95 sandwich could be and neither could she. It was THAT GOOD! So simple, yet insanely rich and flavorful. The tart was delicious as well and made the perfect ending to the breakfast. The coffee was refilled constantly while we stayed to chat well after the food was finished. This kind of establishment is part of the reason I love this city. You can go to an authentic French bakery and bask in the splendor of feeling like you're in another time and place, then pack up and head back to reality a five minute drive away. I've returned to Patisserie Manon on several occasions since that first visit. Service has been continually friendly and attentive. I've since tried the apple flan and some macarons, which are divine. I'll never stop ordering that ham and cheese croissant though.
