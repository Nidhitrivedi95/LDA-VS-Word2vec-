mr4FiPaXTWlJ3qGzp4-7Yg We went on a Travelzoo coupon and we arrived early for our 7:30 reservation. No problem, here's your table. Our server was fantastic! I can't remember his name, unfortunately. He made excellent suggestions, was very helpful, knew all the dishes, and the ingredients.
We had the Beef Carpaccio and Squid Ceviche in Gozpacho to start and were blown away by both!
 My wife was really looking forward to the lamb shank, which was not on that days' menu, so our server suggested the Venison loin. My wife had never had venison, so it took a little convincing, but she loved it.  It was probably the best venison I've ever tasted. I had the polenta with the wild boar sugo. very good. We also ordered the Roasted Jerusalem Artichokes, which were fantastic. 
The wine was very good, and dessert was excellent, Maple Panna Cotta and Sticky Toffee Pudding.
 All in all an excellent dining experience.
