dd3GZs6zW2t7BM0cbxAzvg This was a great bistro experience! Meats were perfectly cooked, venison tartar was well seasoned. Veggies were perfect. And atmosphere was lively. The seating was a little tight.- a drunk group on the corner in combination with being so close to other tables just made it hard to have  a private conversation. The service felt rushed- pleasant enough but our server  kept trying to clear our table and  fill our wine glasses too  often- she could have slowed it down a bit. Very sold with a menu that had several daily specials so you could return often and never get bored with it.
