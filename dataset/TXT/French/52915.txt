QeFsIMcIFIJcOrpthYL8jg Amazing professional jazz band on Saturday (2nd floor). It's a wonderful show while eating. I recommend you to try the filet mignon, it's a blast, as well as their risotto (I'm normally quite picky when it comes to risotto). 

However, you need to make a reservation first. Otherwise, you might have to wait outside for an hour. It's a very popular place in the Old Montreal.
