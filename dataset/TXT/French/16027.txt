78TC3sZSYBzBsSJ0z5pyhw We will not be coming back here. 

We were given a Groupon 20 for 40 from a friend & thought we would try it. The menu online looked interesting. So we made reservations. When we got there there are no instructions that guests with reservations don't have to wait in the line. Oh we'll no biggie. 

Well we were seated and pretty much ignored us for 15 minutes. We ordered drinks finally & that was the last time we were provided anything to drink. At the 30 minute mark we got the appetizers. The lukewarm lobster bisque had no lobster at all & 2 ravioli at the bottom of a fairly large bowl. The ceasar salad was one half of a heart of romaine lettuce cut all the way down the middle including the core (yuck). We had to cut that off & then cut up the 'salad' to make it eatable. 45-55 minutes into the meal we get the veal we ordered as the main entree & unfortunately it had an odd taste to it so I couldn't finish mine. The waiter took another 10-15 minutes to even ask how the meal was (mind you we haven't had anything to drink in a while either) and he gave me just enough time to nod but little else. 10 more minutes he comes flying by us and we asked for the tab but he didn't acknowledge us. However 8 more minutes & he came with the tab & mentioned our Groupon discount dropped off the box. We packed up like lightening and left a pathetic tip for pathetic service. I felt bad because I know how much the tips mean but I hardly saw this guy. The service was way too long, no refills on our drinks, and even the GM looked right at us as we were getting more & more frustrated with the service and never once came over. I can honestly see no reason to go back to this place as the service was 1 star, the quality was 2 stars and nothing on the menu seemed really stand out (that you couldn't get a more excellent option elsewhere).
