SJo_IjvzdRtCvZVN0cbrRQ My mom and I love finding unique brunch spots, so I wanted a unique place to take here when she came to visit. This is the best bakery that I have found in the Akron area.

I got the corned beef hash, plus a whole bagful of pastries! Everything was spot on, plus most of their ingredients are local and organic! I highly recommend The Blue Door to anyone looking for something different and delicious!
