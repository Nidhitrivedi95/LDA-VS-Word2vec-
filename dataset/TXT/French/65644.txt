U4e-0KtL2aPURQwbefjF3Q I've been passing this place for years and always thought it was a long-abandoned pizza joint based on the exterior. Imagine my surprise when I found out that this place is not only still in business, but also sells middle-eastern food!

I came here for chicken shawarma during lunchtime. The dark interior wasn't very inviting and the atmosphere was kind of bleak. I immediately spotted a chicken shawarma sandwich on the menu for $5.99, but despite my best efforts couldn't find chicken being roasted on a spit anywhere behind the counter. I did see a roasting spit by the wall, but this equipment wasn't being used at the time. I was hungry and didn't feel like battling the freezing winds outside in search of a new lunch place, so I decided to place an order despite my misgivings. Where did my meat come from? Beats me.

I received my wrap promptly and ventured out back to find a seat. The seating area was pretty small, with a few bar stools and a couple of tables (one of which was occupied by an employee). I enjoyed the food but it was nothing to write home about. The bits of chicken lacked the crispiness you'd expect from roasted meat. I also would've liked more toppings (seriously, no pickles?!). That being said, the garlic sauce and the hot sauce were delicious!
