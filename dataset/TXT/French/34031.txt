hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA I keep coming back here! The food just gets better and better. If you do decide to come often, you too will start to notice - the soups, sandwiches, even desserts are Not made the same way each time! That is a good thing! There are variations on ingredients that keep the palate alive and guessing. Today I had 2 things which are superb. One of them is not even on the menu yet. SO, I hope you too can get it - Pesto Vegetarian Spinach Wrap with pesto, cilantro, tomato, spinach, goat cheese and mushrooms and it was grilled! Plus the wrap was pesto too.... Simply delicious :)  For dessert, I had Chocolate Pudding Tart. It was sweeter, yummier than ever before. Olivier's mum told me, it had more cream than chocolate and that she was adjusting the recipe. Kiki and I ate it in under a minute! Mouthwatering, mind-boggling goodness. We also ate the Prosciutto Salad - my bill came to a whopping $13 dollars! Then Olivier gave us 2 breakfast pastries to take home. I shook his hand, and told him sadly that I would not be seeing him till Monday.
It is getting busier here.
There are tables outside. Both in front, and on the side. The side tables sit in the sun. One of the very few outdoor cafes in Vegas. It will be a good year for Baguette Cafe is my prediction.
