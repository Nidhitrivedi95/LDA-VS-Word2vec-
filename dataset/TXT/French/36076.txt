hzyvL2v97xLzLbLXcdi1uw My star rating is kind. I don't know - are these guys French? I think not, or, if they are, they were never Crepe chefs. As a long-time customer of Crepes Parisiennes, I fully admit bias, but being tired of the shut-out at C.P. over holidays, I decided to try Cafe Moulin. Heck, I was thrilled to see that the "crepe genre" had been maintained despite the loss of C.P. in that spot.  I really like the do-over and being able to sit down and be served, but sadly, the Salmon crepe was fishy. The Cafe Au Lait was just coffee and milk. Of course I guess C.P.'s espresso based Cafe Au Lait is Pittsburgh's best anyway. I found it patronizing to have the meal explained to me. I wondered: if the owners _are_ perhaps French, I guess they think that Pittsburgh is the same as Bug Tussle  Alabama -- "we done never had crepes befo'" Whatever.

Having had crepes in Paris, I think Crepes Parisiennes is much closer to the mark. I'm sorry for that, because I am a customer and not a loyalist. I would like Pittsburgh to have another great crepery and I don't care who runs it.
