Sandwiches are on fresh French bread, and gigantic, which justifies their $9 price tag. Staff recommends the Italian as their favorite.  They also have a lunch special featuring a soup of the day and fresh French bread. 

I was a little disappointed in the nonfat café latte I ordered: I'm used to French coffee being a bit stronger and bolder than what I was served here, which was a bit overly milky and didn't seem to be strong. Perhaps the beverages aren't their highlight.

Service was warm and genuine, and happy to suggest menu items to try. Location interior is homey and clean, without being shabby. Not sure this was the best area to open a bakery given the close proximity to German Bakery and the Kosher place across the intersection, but if they emphasize their French offerings, they should do well.
