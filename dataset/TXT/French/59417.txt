rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w I've never bothered to review Le Cirque before because, hey, it's Le Cirque.  OF COURSE it's five stars.  You need me to tell you that?  It's one of the finest restaurants in the world.  And, unlike some famous New York restaurants, the Las Vegas outpost of Le Cirque is not just a namesake.  It is simply fantastic.

I have recently found myself compelled to give less than stellar ratings to a couple of other Bellagio restaurants.  So, in the interest of fairness, I wanted to say something nice about a Bellagio dining experience.  Yelp defines five stars as "Woohoo!  As good as gets!"  Le Cirque is that.

If I had to quibble about something (and believe me, that's not easy here) I would mention that I might like a menu that is less "bundled."  I'm not a big dessert fan, so I would be happy with a menu that allowed more of an a la carte selection, and didn't require me to order a multi-course meal with dessert.  But, you know, if I have to choke down a Crème Brûlée or a  Soufflé - well, as they say, c'es la vie.
