JezHN-9KKLTMbojq00VP0g Cute restaurant, definitely recommend making reservations because its small. We went for Sunday brunch- 2 of us shared an omelet (can't remember name but it was vegetarian and had tomatoes, fresh mozzarella and pesto in it- $10)-- came with breakfast potatoes. The omelette was ok-- bland but good. They also let us sub the croissant instead of toast without an extra charge. The croissant looked amazing, but was disappointing. It was hard and dry, was not very tasty either. The nutella crepe with strawberries ($7) was amazing, perfect amount of nutella and was delicious. Definitely better than the omelette. We also had mimosas, bellinis ($7 each) and a bloody mary. The drinks were good, bloody mary could have been spicier, overall it was a good experience. Good, fresh food and friendly service.
