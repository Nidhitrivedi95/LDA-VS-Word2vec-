d482l58ho0_IMdFkXX1F5Q I had dinner with my beloved wife and her long time friend. We ordered many things but what impressed us the most was the sea shellfish platter (called shellfish plateau there). Its a meal for 2, good quality of sea food and fresh. We also ordered escargot, chicken breast, Cesar salad, and prosciutto. All meals were good and yummy. Service also good. We sure recommended this restaurant to have seafood. Oops, the dessert also incredibly nice.
