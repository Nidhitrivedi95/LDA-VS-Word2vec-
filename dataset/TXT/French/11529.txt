4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw My aunt regularly visits Las Vegas and Paris (France) so she knows plenty about French cuisine. Out of several places in LV to choose from, she decided to treat my family to Mon Ami Gabi.

We had the country pate, trout amandine, and 3 steak frites, with different sauces - Au Poivre, Classic, and Bordelaise. We also shared for dessert the creme brulee and chocolate mousse. Everything tasted great -- I would say the steak I had would rank among the top 10 I've ever had anywhere. The trout was flavorful and remained moist on the inside while crunchy on the outside. Pate was flavorful but not overly rich. The chocolate mousse was superb -- flavorful without being too sweet; my mother is not usually a fan of mousse but like theirs so much, she kept taking bites from the bowl!

If one opts to just go for the steak, this is a fairly affordable meal, at about $30-40/ plate. Food portions are great -- not too little but not too much.  Our tab ended up in the several hundred dollar range but this was largely due to the 3 bottles of wine we ordered. 

I made reservations so we were given a nice table near the patio with a wonderful view of the fountains.
