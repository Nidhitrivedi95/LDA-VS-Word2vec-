xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g We had a reservation for 9:30pm on Saturday night. We arrived 15 minutes early and were seated right away. We had a table overlooking the Bellagio fountains and the Las Vegas Strip. The view was priceless. The servers were quick and attentive. If you are thinking of proposing to your significant other this is the place. Three couples got engaged the 90 minutes we were there. For dinner we had the rack of lamb which was delicious. Entrees are about 35-70 and cocktails are around 20 a drink. Good food, great scenery.
