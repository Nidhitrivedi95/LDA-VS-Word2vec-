1aj4TG0eFq6NaPBKk6bK7Q LOVE LOVE this hidden gem in the Trails shopping plaza. Casual with classy touch. Food is fresh- organic, vegetarian, gluten free options and a refreshing change from all those same-old cafes. Delicious dinner options. A MUST go-to neighborhood place for locals . BIG thumbs up!!
