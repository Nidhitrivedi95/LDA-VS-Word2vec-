O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q One thing you do not think about when you go in with a bigger group is the convenience for everyone to pay with credit cards when you order a meal since not everyone will be loaded with cash. Went in with a group of ten and was told they could not process more than three cards. Eventually we got to talk to the manager and we were able to pay with up to five cards. Still, pretty unacceptable since I could go to a Chili's and everybody would be able to have a more affordable meal and be able to pay with credit cards if you wanted to.

My meal that was the seafood variety was pretty good, and the bread was good, but that was about it in terms of having quality food from an expensive place like this. My friends had steaks that were very mediocre, and we ordered four sides that got cold pretty quick, the best thing probably being the french fries.

We went around 9:30PM, so maybe the staff was tired. You don't pay $50 expecting for your meal to be less than stellar, including a rather underwhelming experience for a restaurant on the strip. May be better for a smaller group, because it was horrible for us.
