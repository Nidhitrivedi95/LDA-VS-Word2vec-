Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA I didn't know what to expect coming here to mix. I figured I was staying at the hotel why not come here for dinner as well. After all it was my b day weekend. Made reservations with the concierge earlier that day in the lobby. 

We arrived around 7 or so. Took the elevator up. The decor is really nice. All white, with glass ornaments hanging throughout the ceiling. We were seated right away. Ordered a few drinks for me and my date. Our waiter took pretty good care of us. And was on top of things for the most part. My date ordered some chicken with veggies dish. I ordered the filet mignon. Also had a side of Mac and cheese. My filet i gotta tell you was excellent. I highly recommend it. My dates chicken was ok. Nothing spectacular, but good. Mac and cheese was good. But I mean how fancy can u make it.

In the middle of our meal, our waiter brought us some complimentary champaign. Which surprised me. Later he told us it was from our concierge that we had made the reservation with. Earlier that day. Which was really surprising. Considering I didn't even tip the guy. No desert. But the meal was just really good. I had to kick myself at the end of the meal because i didn't even bother taking in the strip view everyone so dearly talks about. Prices were exactly what they should be. Pricey but well worth it. I'll most likely make the trip here again. FYI I was here back in June 2k10.
