w1BbvLeKBSKBnlALLhPmGg I went here on a slightly damp Saturday afternoon and it was a nice place to have a quiet bit to eat and drink with a friend. We were there about 3 hours and there was no hurrying us away (even though we nursed along two drinks each, with some bar snacks).


 I was driving so couldn't partake of one of the extensive range of cocktails but they did look awfully good and my companion approved of hers. Service was friendly and good without being pushy. Pretty much as soon as we contemplated going to find the waitress, she appeared!


 We had some of their two for £6 bar snacks (also four for £12 and six for £18, which seemed superfluous!) which were lovely but the portions were not generous. Do not expect them to make a filling lunch!
