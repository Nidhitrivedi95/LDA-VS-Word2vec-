xcmmTXhuMx2fZF2Bt69F4w Had the red curry moules at this quaint point breeze eatery.  The curry was on point and moules perfectly steamed.  Pomme fritz very delicious too!  It's small so expect to wait.  They have a good beer selection but I knocked them back 1 star cuz they only have 4 choices on draft.  Overall great service and nice ambiance in this one.  Can't miss if you like mussels!
