while it's no secret that this isn't the real Eiffel Tower, the secret is this: reasonably priced food and a surprisingly relaxed atmosphere. not things you normally expect of the French, or their Vegas colony, but nice to see.

the spicy lamb burger is hefty, juicy, and packed with flavor. get it. do not pass go. proceed directly to the lamb burger. it does not disappoint. FOR GREAT JUSTICE.

service was friendly and fast.

the view out on the Strip is tough to beat, especially when you see the Bellagio fountains going off. worth it.
