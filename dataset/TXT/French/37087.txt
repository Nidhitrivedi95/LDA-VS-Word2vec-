IQ5TkJX2Hin9O0uJNDoyZw Food was not bad, price was on the cheaper side. I tried their veggie curry and was pleased to see lots of veggies. The curry was light; I usually like them richer. They served us fast, so for this reason, it's a good location to go downtown during lunch. I was not impressed by their service. First, they couldn't answer my questions about whether the soup broth and spring rolls were vegetarian and they took away my spring rolls without notice. This was upsetting because I wasn't done eating. They only accept debit, as an FYI.
