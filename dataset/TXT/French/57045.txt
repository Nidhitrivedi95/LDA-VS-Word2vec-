rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A The first stop on my birthday extravaganza was Bouchon.  3 adults and 2 children.  

It is beautiful inside of Bouchon. Their big windows make it a warm and inviting place to enjoy brunch.

The part that stood out most for this brunch was the word: SPILL.

I heard it yelled behind me, in slow motion almost. I looked forward and saw grape-fruit juice all over the table, I turned back around and saw people coming from all around with towels prepared, and still heard the calls of: "Spill, she spilled!"  

My 21 year old clumsy sister spilled her juice all over the table. I'm giving Bouchon an extra-star for their quick table change which showed their service. It was quite embarrassing, but undoubtedly the funniest part of the meal. I still get a good chuckle thinking about it.

ANYWAYS: The FOOD!

I REALLY wanted to love Bouchon. I've dreamed about dining here (but mostly The French Laundry, which I WILL one day...)  forever now, and finally I did..... I ordered the Croque Madame, which was good! Don't get me wrong, I highly enjoyed the sandwich and their fritas are tasty too! My daughter munched most of mine. 

I just didn't get that WOW factor I had been expecting, maybe I ordered the wrong item? The only time I did have a melting-in-my-seat experience from yumminess was when I tried their pastries! MMmmm. We ordered 2 croissants, a banana-nut muffin for the little ones, and a nummy pecan sticky bun. Go try them, NOW!

I will go back, probably for dinner before brunch again.
