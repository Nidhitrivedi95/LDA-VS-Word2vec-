The setting is very nice, and the menu sounds wonderful.  I had:


The Bison tartar for an appetizer and

Halibut with roasted carrot, roasted orzo and wilted chard

The last time I had steak tartar it was at Maison Robert-  it was traditional with eggs and caper and was out of this world.  I realized this appetizer was going to be completely different, and it was.  The bison was sort of dry and the main flavor was salt.  Honestly, the whole grain mostado with pickled onions on the toast was better than the tartar, and it was about a teaspoon in size.  For a $50 meal with tax I don't mind small portions, but I expect to be dazzled with flavor.

Likewise the halibut was lacking in flavor.  It was cooked well, and tasted fresh, but I enjoyed the orzo and chard more.  I think I noticed a hint of fennel in the orzo, which I will try at home, so at least I learned an alternative preparation.

The service was about what you can expect these days as the waitstaff talked to one another (it was later in the evening about 40 minutes before they closed when I checked out), and they were attentive.  

In the days when 20-25% tips are expected, and the majority of reviews rave about the food, I want to be objective.  I'm rating House of Tricks based on their prices reflect fine dining.  Maybe I ordered poorly, but I chose items that I typically wouldn't cook myself and sounded different than I could get elsewhere. The food was by no means awful it just lacked pizazz.
