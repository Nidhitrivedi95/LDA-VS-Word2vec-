50-xiTYmE6NERi-yJ6NvHw Went for buck a shuck with some coworkers. Horribly slow service. It took an hour just to get our oysters and it was all we ordered. It wasn't even busy in the restaurant. Empty tables allllll around. 

Oysters were great but definitely too slow. 

But the server was very kind and polite the whole time. So maybe its better on other nights.
