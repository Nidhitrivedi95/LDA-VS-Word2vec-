rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw My husband and I were very impressed by the food and service at Michael Mina's BARDOT Brasserie! 

We made dinner reservations for our first night in Vegas and we felt like we were taken to Paris with fine ingredients, French decor, and our spectacular and charming server! 

Even though the menu isn't too extensive, we were unsure of what to order at first. Everything sounded so good. We finally decided to share the grilled duck wings a l'orange and bone marrow appetizers, beets salad, and Parisian gnocchi with a side of fois gras. 

We had to add the fois gras after reading several good reviews and my goodness, it was just fatty delicacy! My hubby loved it. The Parisian gnocchi was fluffy and pillowy soft. I thought the gnocchi and fois gras combination made that particular dish a bit on the heavy side, especially with the addition of cream. But it was a small portion size so it wasn't hard to finish. The shaved black truffles was also a nice touch to the dish. 

I loved how the beets salad had huge chunks of red and orange beets. The vinaigrette and baked Brie and goat cheeses were a nice touch. We really liked that dish. 

The bone marrow was also fatty goodness as I try to scoop up every ounce of it with the thick toast. I thought there was little bone marrow for the price and wished for more of it than bread. 

I've never had duck wings before but it was meaty (doesn't look like it in the pictures) and had a nice sweet glaze that combines well with the cream that had a hint of orange flavor. 

We thoroughly enjoyed the food and definitely ordered more than we can finish. The service was excellent and the restaurant is just beautiful that we would love to return when we're back in Vegas.
