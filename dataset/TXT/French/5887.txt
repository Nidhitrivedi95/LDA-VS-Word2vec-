3rj1qpgFvkRWtAka17mhEQ Tried the smoked salmon egg Benedict.  Wasn't very impressed as the hollandaise sauce tasted very chalky. Needless to say, I ate it all as I was starving and the side of roasted potatoes were delicious! The house coffee was just ok. The menu was extensive with a variety of different items which can appeal to anyone. The service was also very fast and attentive. I would give it another go and stick to more common American items like French toast or sandwiches.
