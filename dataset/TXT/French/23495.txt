ChwyMZi_eZlMfL9qpXH_zw I was looking forward to this but I was truly disappointed.

Hollandaise sauce is hot hot butter, fresh yolks and lemon juice whisked together into the most delicious and velvety sauce ever. I have no idea what Pause et Vous's sauce was, but it wasn't REAL Hollandaise. Even though the eggs were cooked well, and the ham, and the cheese, it was a real bummer for this Eggs Benedict fan. The rest was ok.

My wife ordered a crepe that she said was adequate. Nothing stood out for us. We won't be back.
