63in7ND_-TPVVI_J12JLRA We went to Robin des Bois last night as part of a work Christmas dinner and the atmosphere was perfect for the event. Not to mention, as a non-for-profit ourselves, we were happy to support another cause. Because of the event size they had split us into two tables, which I feel was pretty reasonable, although our table was definitely getting served faster than the other table.

Allow me to say, the food was amazing- my partner had the French onion soup, which was generous in its size and perfectly seasoned, as well as the risotto which seemed to be very good as well. I had the polenta appetizer and the cat fish which were both delicious- the apple and lima bean garnish to the blackened catfish made the meal for me.

The only real downside I would put to the evening is that because of our group's size and what I figure is the volunteer staff size, it took us two hours to get our meals. Post-hunger rationale, I can really appreciate a volunteer-run business like this, but in the moment we were less than impressed.
