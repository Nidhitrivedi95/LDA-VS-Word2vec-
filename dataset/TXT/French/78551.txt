They are located in Mimi's former location, following the fire several years ago.  However, unlike Mimi's, Le Madeleine is more of a fast-casual place, rather than a sit-down restaurant. 

Having never been before, I needed some time to decide, and the staff were very patient and helpful.  I selected a quiche lorraine, a creme brûlée, and a water, all for $10.  I think that is pretty reasonable for this caliber of food.  

The quiche was precooked and heated so it could be served quickly.  Regardless of the reheating, I thought it was delicious.  The creme brûlée was served cold so the topping wasn't really crusty, but it was still delicious.  

The dining area is very cozy and comfortable.  Nicer than a Panera, and certainly better than any fast food joint.  

I like that Le Madeleine has many options for meals, including samplers and made to order crepes.  This place beats any of the food court options in the mall, and is worth the drive across the street.
