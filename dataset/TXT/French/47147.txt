O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q Pros...
Good flavor of the steak

Good service...till food dropped

Cons....
Poor service once food arrived

Ends of steak charcoal not char broiled

Creme Brulee....ick custard was way over cooked and tasteless

How much was that glass of wine....

Sat at bar...all of the usual places I would normally go were full or hosting private parties.  Ordered NY strip med. rare and brussel sprouts.  Good service and banter from the male/female bar team.  Food came, ordered a glass of wine. Steak was a bit over temp but not enough to be objectionable...
However the outside was charged to the point it was hard to cut thru.  The ends where the steak tapered down had enough of the crust that the burnt taste<U+200B> overwhelmed the good parts.  Sprouts were good.  Now that the food was dropped getting the bartenders attention was a fail.  Finally had a bar back order a creme brulee....at least 20 minutes elapsed before it arrived.  The custard was way over cooked and rubbery...to top it off it was tasteless.  Called it a night and got the check....umm $85 for a glass of wine....the bottle is only 16 or so more!

Save yourself and look elsewhere.
