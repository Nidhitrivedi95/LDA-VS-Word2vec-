mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q WOW!  Eating hear is truly an experience.  Part dining, and part art show.  You know it's going to be different the minute you walk in and see the modern piano black, chrome, and red decor.  Sit at the bar and watch all the action.  Part of a new trend (at least, for me) where the chefs double as servers.  They didn't offer the $75 tasting menu when we went.  Instead, we had to get the much more expensive 10 course Discovery Menu.  It was worth it.  Be prepared to sit for awhile, like at least 3 hours.  Not a good place for a pre-show dinner.  This is an event all its own.
     Each course creative and well thought out.  Functional art.  Not only good to look at, but real delicious food.  The complex flavors and textures  always leave you wanting more.  Of course, I didn't love all the dishes.  But, that's the best part of a tasting menu for me.  I get to try out as much of the restaurant's menu including some things I wouldn't order if I was limited to a few courses.  The Discovery menu is quite adventurous and includes: foie gras in three different courses, oysters, dover sole, lobster, and smoked salmon.  We also ordered skirt steak off the a la carte menu, which was my favorite.  The simple things are done so well.  For example, the best part of the foie gras ravioli in warm chicken broth with herbs was not the ravioli, but the perfectly balanced chicken broth.  It was, hands down, the best broth I have ever had.  I wish I had gallons of this stuff.  
     I could never justify getting the Discovery menu again but I will definitely go back for some a la carte items if I'm ever near the MGM Grand.  This is a definite must for adventurous appetites who appreciate food that is artfully and painstakingly prepared for taste and presentation.

Note:  Not a good place if you go with a party of more than 4.
