Food-wise, the pastries were good, but not worth the price. I've had better for cheaper. My family and I ordered every croissant type they had available at the time: butter, almond, chocolate-almond, apple, & chocolate. They were all okay, but not the best. 
My personal favorite was the chocolate croissant.
