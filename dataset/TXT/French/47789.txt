O3OH5IEFMPtz7mPKakPZ3Q Great little tapas place! If you are looking for sushi, then this place isn't for you. They have French and Japanese food which is great. We had the honor to meet the executive chef/owner of the place. He was really nice and was incredibly passionate about food! He was proud of his ingredients and even showed me some of the escargots. He really made us feel welcomed and the food was good. We ordered almost everything on the menu. The salmon and tuna tacos were great! They were wonton fried skin shells with sashimi pieces in it. The edamame with truffle oil was delicious. Gyozo was okay. Nothing special to be honest. The lettuce wraps with black cod was amazing while the sea bass one was deep fried, so I perferred the black cod over the sea bass. The rock shrimp was great, packed with flavor. I recommend this! The side of mushrooms were just that. Haha but I love mushrooms, so I can't complain. The tuna lotus chips were a unique creation. If I had to choose between the tacos and this, I would go for the tacos, but have to try something once! Both the kushiyaki beef and chicken were great! They are skewers, and very juicy! The japaniero fried rice special was great! It has shrimp, beef and chicken. Mmm... Goes well with the rock shrimp. They are in the process of getting a liquor license, so get ready everyone for amazing, fresh, quality food and alcohol! Woo woo! Did I mention they have happy hour after 10? Whaaaaaa?!?! Nom nom
