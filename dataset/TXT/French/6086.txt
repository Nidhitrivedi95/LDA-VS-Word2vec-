3uC7Lbc3RgUDTWQlBu4PqQ While this little Bouchon outpost has decent espressos and very nice service, I have been disappointed in the famous Keller macarons each of the three or four times I've had them. Macarons are my favorite treat and these have simply been stale every time. They are hard, not crisp and light. I can't eat the other bread-y things because I'm gluten intolerant, so I can't speak for those items. I would come back for the espresso though, certainly.
