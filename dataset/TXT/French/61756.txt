sphMzEIqY1I2Dzv3zLZY2g I waited to review this restaurant, until we had the pleasure of trying both the Upstairs (more elegant dining) and the Downstairs (more casual dining). We have now tried both and have enjoyed it throughly. The new location is much better than the former, where they are accommodating for either of your dining needs (elegant or casual).

We celebrated my wife's birthday upstairs and it was wonderful. We each (3 of us) had 4 courses and everyone loved their dishes. The waiter was excellent, was engaging, knowledgeable about the menu, personable but not to much. We came back a week later and sat outside, and along with the rest of the appetizers that we enjoyed, we had the best burger we have ever had. 

We love good food, I am not one for over the top presentations. The food may look good but does it taste good? And it did INDEED! Well done!
