QeFsIMcIFIJcOrpthYL8jg Pretty good, but not good enough for the prices - hence the 3 stars.

Still, all around a great meal. 

About a 10 minute stroll from Chinatown and just 1 block from the water.

The French onion soup gratin is a must.

Fish there is done very well (ask for it to be medium rare) as is the game fowl dishes.

Service is matter of fact, but caring all in one. We love our evening and would recommend you check it out if you're looking for French flair food.
