D7CnTsm8SCmbQghz1ioPdw We had an early reservation and was seated almost right away as the restaurant was not busy. It was great date night atmosphere. Waitress seemed knowledgeable about the menu. I had the cod with celery purée and my husband had the bison burger. The cod was rather tasteless. I understand that they were probably trying not to overpower the taste of the fish but the entire dish needed some seasoning. The only thing that had flavor were the Brussels sprouts so I was pretty disappointed. My husband's bison burger was pretty tasty though. Towards the end of the meal the restaurant became very busy. Our table was neglected. We sat a while before we flagged the waitress down for the bill. Overall it was just an ok experience for me.
