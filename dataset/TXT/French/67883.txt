V0iYi5OjdRcz82m95jV7vQ A great place for French pastries! Stopped in for a croissant but ended up walking out with the croissant, an almond croissant, and a bag full of macarons. Without a doubt, the best macarons I've had here in Charlotte, barely edging out the macarons at Cafe Monte! Will definitely frequent here more to eventually try everything in the case!
