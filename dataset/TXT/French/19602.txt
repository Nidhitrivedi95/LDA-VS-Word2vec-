aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw I came here twice. The first day of my vacation then the last day :) the people that helped me were friendly and patient. I'm glad because it took some time for me to decide what flavor of macarons I wanted. I paid for the "buy 5 get one free" macaron deal they had. My favorite was either the caramel or vanilla. They are also larger than the usual macaron I'm used to, so that was also a plus.
