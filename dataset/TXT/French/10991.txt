4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw This restaurant in Las Vegas is a great spot to relax and have a nice brunch. Food is good, I recommend the seafood crepes, it sounds kind of strange for crepes but trust me they are Delish! The service isn't the greatest though. when I went the host wasn't too helpful and didn't seem to know how to accommodate last minute requests, maybe she was new. The food took a long time to arrive, I had filled myself up with French bread by the time I got my food. I expected better service since it is a pricey place. Nevertheless, you be the judge!
