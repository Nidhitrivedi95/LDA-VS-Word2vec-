i only had the macaroons here but they were pretty tasty. possibly the biggest ones i had, for about $3.30 a piece it was a light, flaky macaroon with a light cream filling. the lemon was a bit tart but also a bit sweet making it the perfect balance. the raspberry was a little too sweet but it was still not bad if you have milk or water to wash it down. definitely coming back to try other flavors!
