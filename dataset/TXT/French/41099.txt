kevp3zZnKe6z-erUffgHuw It's a nice French restaurant with a cute little terrace right on Prince Arthur. Their service is polite and pretty quick, so you won't have to wait too long. It's BYOB, so now you can choose your own wine at the SAQ and bring it with you to drink at the restaurant. I strongly recommend their tartare, very good choice actually. Overall, it's a nice place to have a date night, friendly dinner of take your grandmother out for some wine and tartare.
