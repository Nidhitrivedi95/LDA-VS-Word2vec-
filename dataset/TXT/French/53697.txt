There's a beautiful patio outside where you can looking at a falling water fountain, and if it's dark, periodic light shows.  The atmosphere would be really great for a date.

My food was also delicious. I was with a friend who had never had Escargot, so we tried that. It was a non-traditional preparation, but interesting.  Then, for my main course I had the scallops. The texture was perfect.

The waiter managed to talk me into the Meyer Lemon Dessert. It was fabulous. The lemon was delicious, but moreover it came with BASIL ICE CREAM.  It may have been the best ice cream I've ever had.

Definitely go here if you're in Vegas.
