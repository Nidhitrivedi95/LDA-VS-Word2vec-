4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Four stars for the best French Onion Soup ever!!!  The serving size is huge.  One star for the great service.  I liked the Vine Cart that was rolled around to give you a view of the bottle before purchasing a glass of wine.  Limited availability of mixed cocktails.  Two of us ordered steak and they were good but not outstanding.  We dined inside due to the 100 degree heat that day but the view on the patio would be outstanding.
