rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w I have to admit I was a tad underwhelmed at Le Cirque. We chose to go there before our show for their prix-fixe pre-theater dinner. I ended up doing a different menu as I felt the pre-theater dinner was too restrictive. However, I was disappointed to see that the portions were the same as mine even though I was told they would be smaller on the pre-theater menu. 

I had the lobster salad which I had read raves about on here. Truthfully, I thought it was kinda 'meh'... nothing special.  I tasted my friend's lobster bisque from the pre-theater menu and thought that was much better.  I had upgraded to the beef w/fois gras and it was good, but again, nothing special even with fois gras on top --of which there was very little I might add. Even my dessert -- a young cocount with sorbet and pineapples was very lackluster. It looked kinda cool coming out in the coconut but you can't taste the coconut cuz it's hard so it's really just sorbet w/some pineapple chunks. I wouldn't recommend it. 

All in all I think it was an okay meal but not of the caliber I expected based on the notoriety of the NYC Le Cirque. With so many good food options in Las Vegas, I doubt I'd ever go back here.
