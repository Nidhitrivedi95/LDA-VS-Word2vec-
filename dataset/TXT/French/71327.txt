xcmmTXhuMx2fZF2Bt69F4w I guess its kind of a sin to go to Point Brugge and NOT have the moules, but hey - I'm a sinner.

We got there at about 2pm on a Saturday afternoon in February, expecting it to be kind of quiet.  It was absolutely hopping.  We waited about 10 minutes for a table and game on--

Starting with the Roasted Tomato and Spinach Dip.  SO GOOD!  Generous serving, perfect for sharing. 
 
Then for me the Chicken Milanese - very good but, as soon as I saw my friends face after her first bite I did have Butternut Squash Gnocchi envy.  She indicated that the gnocchi was made from the butternut squash and immediately began to formulate possible recipes.
 
The place is small, the service is excellent.  We were seated up the stairs and immediately around the corner so neither of us could see much of anything.  We were doing a lot of chatting though, so that was ok... but not awesome.
  
We both saw some other things on the lunch menu that we'd like to try, so maybe we'll try another Saturday - this time at 3pm.
