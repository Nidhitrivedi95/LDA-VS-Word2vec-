oZHbPhIj01_31jqD053a_Q Perfect. Great experience. Such a tremendous attention to details. And we are talking abut food, not a powerpoint presentation. Was pleasantly surprised by both food, and service. The way they serve it, is simply a performance. But make sure you come in early, when the floor is not that packed, otherwise the waiters won't have enough time to present the food to you. High cuisine / almost Art :). Definitely coming back again next time I am in Montreal.
