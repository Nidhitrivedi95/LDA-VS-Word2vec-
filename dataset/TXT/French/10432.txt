4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Second time here for breakfast and still amazing. Eggs Benedict is divine with fresh made in house English muffins, thin Canadian bacon and a light sauce. My husband ordered the quiche.  I usually don't eat quiche but tried it and it was the best I'd had with such great flavor! I'd order it again.  Service is always great.  I'll be back!
