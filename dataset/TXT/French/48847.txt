Nestled right at the check-in area of The Bellagio! Best place to watch old guys with young girls, drunk girls, groups of just turned 21 bros and everything else in between! What a perfect spot for people watching!

We only ended up getting drinks but the live piano music was great and so was our bartender. I forgot his name, but he was an older guy that knew his stuff! We racked up a bill and he sure did take care of us! Thumbs up on the mixology!

I would have given this place 5 stars but it was obvious that when we were at the bar, there was an argument going on among the staff. Particularly, the female servers were complaining to one another about a young busser guy that would take orders and check on tables for them. He thought he was doing the girls a favor but he was actually screwing them up because he would take food and drink orders and get the tables and orders mixed up. yiKes! I used to work in the restaurant business and I know what this is like. The hosts want to be servers, the bussers want to be anyone else and the servers want to kill the manager. Love it.  It was Vegas entertainment for free.

TIP: Sit at the tables to the left upon entrance for better people watching views. Right side is a bit sheltered by the slots, but still a good view too.

I'd go here again each time I visit the Bellagio!
