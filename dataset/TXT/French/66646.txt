uP3H5bcsiTXM0k0xQhRndg Come here, and do it now.  This place is arguably one of my favorite restaurants in Montreal.  It was so good, my girlfriend and I went two nights in a row.  Yeah, it's that good.  Let's begin.

The wait can be long, but be patient, it's worth it.  They have a nice microbrew beer selection as well as a wine list.  The food, is incredible.  An ever changing simple and small menu, everything we tried was delicious.  Their house favorites happened to be my favorites as well, their mac 'n cheese, pork belly, steak, and calamari.  I would be writing a novel describing the intracacies of each dish, so I won't.  You really just need to try it for yourself, you won't regret a single thing.  Oh and don't forget dessert, order the pouding chomeur.  Change your life.

The service may seem hectic, but they are seamless, efficient and hospitable.  Sylvia, is super friendly and bubbly, and makes you feel right at home.

Needless to say, I will be returning, and bringing everyone and anyone that will want to have a truly great dining experience.
