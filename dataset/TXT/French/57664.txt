rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I cannot believe that Thomas Keller put his name anywhere near this restaurant. Doesn't he run two of the top restaurants in the WORLD???? I would expect the BEST service, the BEST ambiance and the BEST food from him.

Our waiter was sweaty and had to read from a notepad to tell us the specials. He never once asked me if I wanted a refill on our wine. In fact, he never checked in one us (during our hour and half meal) to see if we needed anything. Kudos to the busboy and the other wait staff for stepping up a bit b/c he SUCKED. The place was messy - there was food on the floor and the dessert menu was actually dirty! I opted against ordering dessert not only b/c there was leftover god-know-what on the menu, but b/c the options were so bland. I could have gone to denny's and had better options - i think i could have flan , ice cream with chocolate sauce, lemon tart or chocolate mousse. Hmmm - real high class options!?!?!?!

The food, I have to admit, was good. I'm not saying GREAT - but good. I sure as hell cannot believe we paid $38 for a slab of PORK...but that's the price of taking a chance and ordering a special from a sweaty red-faced waiter who kinda splittles when he talks (I think he mighta been high or drunk). 

To give you some perspective - Martini House is one of my favorites - the food, ambiance and staff are ALWAYS impecible. Chez Pannise is a miracle as far as restaurants go. I can go there and order anything off their menu and want to lick the plate. I will never go anywhere near Bouchon again...and if this is what I can expect from the French Laundry...then...fuck their three month wait list. Why would I even go there?
