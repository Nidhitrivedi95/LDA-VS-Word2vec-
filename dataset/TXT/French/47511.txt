O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q I tried ou Morel's French Steakhouse on a business trip, traveling alone.  I went right before the dinner rush.  I couldn't have asked for anything more in a meal experience.  The staff was VERY helpful and knowledgable.  The cheese selection was out of this world, the wine was wonderful.  Needless to say the steak was to die for.  I can't see how anyone would have a complaint about this restaurant.  Yep it is expensive, but you are at a steakhouse in Vegas....duh.  
DELICIOUS!!!!!!
