xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g Amazing food and wine with a great view!  We have stayed at Paris before and have dined at this restaurant before but I just have to comment on it. The place has a great wine list with a sommelier that is very good recommendations. 

We had the seafood appetizer and it is worth the money. Yes it is a bit pricey, but this is not McDonalds. My husband got a filet with a truffle sauce that was out of this world. We are planning to go back just to get this entree. My food was amazing as well, and I feel that you just can't go wrong here. 

We recommend it for a very special romantic dinner.
