ZrHU8ZzwZQjTRpB1K_8JTQ I see that 1847 is closing to "retool," which I don't oppose because I really want to see this place work in my community. It's got some great things going for it: an historic building on a well-traveled street, a beautiful outdoor patio and ample parking. But I have to say, after 5 visits, it's still missing a few things. 

1) SEATING THE GUESTS. The first time we went, our wait was 30 minutes. To be fair, the place had only recently opened but here were empty tables everywhere. Everything appeared poorly run. The next time we made a reservation, but still were asked to wait 10 minutes for our table to be prepared. The following two visits were great, which we chalked up to early bugs working themselves out. But last night we went again. Seated immediately (nice!), but the hostess didn't tell the wait staff! We sat for 20 minutes until I went back in and reminded them we were there and finally got a server.  
2). COCKTAIL SERVICE. I love a good craft-made cocktail. The "Scarlet Letter" is noteworthy! But you've got to streamline that as well. A 10-minute wait for a drink is too long in the thirsty suburbs. 
3) NOISE. I know that noise is trendy in the modern dining scene, but people get tired of yelling at each other. The beautiful stone building is an acoustic nightmare, especially if someone in your party is hard of hearing. 

So these thoughts if a "supper club" is going to work: sit people down, don't forget about them, and bring them drinks right away. They will be happier, kinder to your hardworking staff, and will probably be more open to your interesting menu Then present an environment where they can sit comfortably, converse with their friends, and enjoy a long evening without getting hoarse. 

I'd hate to see creative dishes with locally sourced food go away. I'd be willing to pay similar prices (and tip nicely!) if I was impressed AS
SOON  AS I WALKED THROUGH THE DOOR by more than just the awesome building renovation.
