aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw The pastries here are as yummy as ever, but the service is much to be desired. The blond woman who I assume is the manager pretty much berated one of the employees in front of me, making me a bit uncomfortable. I was about to say something, but decided "eh it's not me she's yelling at, so whatevs". I went on to order a baguette and she immediately went to the cash register without asking if I wanted anything else. I guess she assumed I couldn't afford the desserts here? Anywho, I asked for "2 macarohns". And she asked "Oh you want 2 macarOOns?". What a bitch to correct me using the WRONG word. A macarOOn is a coconut cookie dummy. I can't believe Buchon Bakery would actually employ white trash like her. But I guess in Vegas there isn't much to choose from. With her attitude and appearance she should be in the back sweeping up the kitchen floor.
