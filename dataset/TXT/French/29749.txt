fFInb4Dl2Ix4iE-VOltbkQ I enjoyed my dinner immensely and think the chefs are talented.  They can do a lot more with the menu but play it safe, and I think that's a shame.  Our service was fine (especially since we were such a large group), our steaks were good and the space is comfortable.  I would recommend stopping in for dinner for a quiet evening, but I am confident they can do more with the potential there.
