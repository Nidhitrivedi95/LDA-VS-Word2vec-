SJo_IjvzdRtCvZVN0cbrRQ Just returned from dinner here and I would recommend it without hesitation. They are famous for their breakfast but dinner here is so wonderful! First of all, the care and planning they put into this menu was so impressive. The quality of the food and the ingredients involved was outstanding. My husband ordered the oysters and wild boar and both were great- he was so happy with his selections, I had the Ohio tomatoes and organic chicken. Both were amazing but the chicken was seriously the most delicious dinner I have had anywhere in the area. The presentation and care they put into the plating of the food was of high caliber- the meals were really stunning works of art and tasted fantastic. I appreciated the labeling of menu items for those with dietary restrictions. I am gluten free due to a medical issue and I had no problems finding something safe for me to eat and delicious! They even had homemade gluten free Irish soda bread!   The staff was friendly and pleasant. They really showed a knowledge of the menu. I was blown away by this dinner. I didn't even know they were serving dinner until randomly seeing it online. They are knocking it out of the park on this just like they do with breakfast.  If you are looking for a fine dining experience that is truly delightful, pleasant, incredibly delicious and out of the ordinary, go here for dinner. You will not be disappointed. (Then get up and eat breakfast here the next day, if you can handle that much awesome)
