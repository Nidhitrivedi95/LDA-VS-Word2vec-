Interior was homely, lots of wood used on the walls & furniture, there was a chandelier & the bar had accommodation to dine at if you chose to.

Server was a very lively & attentive British man.

Some qualms I had with the place was that my drink was a bit warm & my food not warm enough.

The steak frites was excellent & cooked medium-rare. Steak tartare could have been a bit colder as the dish is meant to be served cold.  Shared PEI Oysters were very fresh & succulent.

 For the prices paid, I expected a little more out of Table 17. There are better options out there for the price range.
