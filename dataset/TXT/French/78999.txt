ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug I had an excellent time at this cafe in the Paris hotel. Sal was very accommodating. My heel was hurting and I asked if he had a bandaid in which he returned with 6 bandaids. The mojitos were also delicious and the food was excellent. My friend and I had a great time. I must go here again in my next trip to Vegas!
