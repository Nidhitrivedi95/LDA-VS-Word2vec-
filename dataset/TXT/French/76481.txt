Yp9w4nhUowBU_IS_StFXbQ I am not a breakfast person; I detest it.  If I'm ever committed to a crime, sentencing me to a carb-laden assault of waffles & pancakes would hopefully be construed as cruel an unusual punishment. 

Of course, my girlfriend is the quintessential breakfast freak.  Spending a few days with her at the Wynn/Encore resulted in an obligatory breakfast trip.

I researched the Wynn's website in order to devise an escape route, and I found it.  It went through a frenchy-breakfasty place called Tableau.

The menu looked exotic but reasonably priced (especially by Vegas/Wynn standards).  Even better, it featured breakfast items that weren't some concoction of carbs and pig.  I immediately made a reservation for Sunday morning.

The place itself is beautiful.  It seriously feels like a setting for a tea party from a fairy tale (in a good way).

We split a tuna tartare appetizer, while I had the Duck Croque Madame and my girlfriend had the Pastrami and Eggs.  

The tuna tartare was some of the best I've ever had, and the portions were more than generous.  The duck croque madame is certainly my new favorite breakfast food (and possibly favorite food of any kind).  The pastrami and eggs were good also, but overshadowed by my dish.

Throw in a couple coffees, and the bill still came to be less than a hundred bucks.  An absolutely astounding meal at a very reasonable price.  This was possibly the highlight of my entire time at the Wynn.
