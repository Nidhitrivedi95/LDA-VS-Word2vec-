If you're on a date night, ask to be seated on the corner tables where the armchairs are. 

The food is well thought, classy and has some sort of a feminin touch without being too much - and the boys will love the pâté en croûte and everything with foie gras.

The servings are just perfect for you to enjoy a 3 course meal. Nice techniques, good flavors, very friendly staff. You should try it !
