YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g We had dinner with a group of eight. Our host ordered shrimp, calamari and bruschetta as appetizers. All three were very good.

Hubby's main course was strip steak with polenta as a side dish. His steak was prepared perfectly. I enjoyed salmon which was excellent. 

I don't order dessert often so I treated myself to a sea salt caramel dish. Oh my goodness. 

What made the experience five stars was the service. It was impeccable.

I have no idea what the final tab was. I calculated that it was around $80 for the two of us.
