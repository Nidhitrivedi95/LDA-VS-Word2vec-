YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g First off, Huber Kelly is adorable and I love his way on top chef masters.  I was torn on which one to go to while in Vegas staying at Mandalay.  I am happy we chose Fleur on a whim.  My man doesn't do tapas bc he is 6'7" and needs FOOD haha.  We got tons of dishes at this place and they were all rocking.  LIKE the gnocchi? Um only 5 came and we were like lets get 20 more. Each. My duck, my ribs, my salad, my cheese, my Chime mmmm Chime (sp?) like I said in my Mandalay Bay review; my man doesn't like tapas but he did at Fleur!!! also the interior is beautiful.
