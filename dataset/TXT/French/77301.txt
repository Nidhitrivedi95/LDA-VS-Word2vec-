YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g Keller's SF location has GOTTA be better than THIS.

Service: Outstanding
Seating: their version of a 'booth', two separate half moons set within earshot of the foyer and the cash wrap.  Grr.
China: Gorgeous painted flowers on white ceramic
Decor: 3500 Ecuadorian roses formed in the shape of a leaf
Food: Boring, a bit salty at points & cash.  $120/pp + $80/pp wine pairing.

- Ahi tartare, all I could taste was salt, which overpowered the fish.
- Celery soup, overly creamy, I sucked up the caviar floating atop & pushed it aside.
- Steak tartare, the brioche was nicely toasted & buttered, another piece would have been perfect.  I enjoyed the swirls of yolk on the plate.
- Salmon, nice and rare, very simple in flavor, the bf complained of the blandness, the ingredients were pedestrian & similar to a chain restaurant.
- Braised ribs w/micro greens and a side of applewood smoked bacon polenta.  Hearty, earthy and the BEST of the savory dishes.  
- Cheese course: goat, sheep, cow & blue, w/drunken grapes, fresh jam, dried fruit & nuts.  Came with sliced bread, the bread was a bit chewy.  I need CRUSTINESS.  The best combo was the goat w/jam and drunken grapes.  
- Basil sorbet with a medley of 'sauteed' fruits.  Delicious and innovative.
- Chocolate tasting.  Chocolate tart, pot de creme, sorbet, cake, & layered coconut.  The tart & pot de creme were fabulous.  I was not too keen on the other three.
-Fresh madellines with chocolate sauce.  Wow.  Crunchy edges.
-Petite four platter, one in five were edible: the chocolate cake bite.
-Espressos, $5/ea, potent.

Too many less than exciting parts of the evening equates to a lower rating.
