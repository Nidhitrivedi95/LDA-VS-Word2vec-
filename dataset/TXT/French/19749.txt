aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw I might have been hella drunk at 6:30 in the morning but the ham and cheese croissantwich was delicious!!!!! We were behind a guy that bought $150.00 worth of pastries and was telling the people behind the counter how he was going to recommend this place to everyone...

As I was devouring my crumbly croissant, I was already full halfway through it... but I kept eating cause it was too damn good!  I took out one star because I really was drunk..... so i need to come back here and try everything while I'm sober. Haha
