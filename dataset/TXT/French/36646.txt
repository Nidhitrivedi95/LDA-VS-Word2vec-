i5vxtyiHKYnRcJ0p9N7mLw If you can teach me how to say "holy cannoli" in Italian you need to know about this entirely fantastic deli! It was recommended to me and I made excuses to get over there i just wish I'd done it sooner! Great big salads and sandwiches hot or cold! Fresh deli chef made pastas and desserts. I'm super excited we work nearby to eat here often. I'll be back soon!
