rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w I expected much better service in such a 5-star expensive restaurant. I would say it is overpriced for the food and the service you received. 

We had a feeling that staff in le cirque were not willing to serve us, especially when a manager came to give us a souvenir (a box of chocolate for each table), he just put it on the table without facing us and immediately turned away. Customers don't deserve basic respect? 

To be fair, the food was ok, my husband and I had a $98 3-dish dinner set for each of us. My appetizer risotto was delicious and my entree (chicken with fra gois)  is good.

Despite the food was ok, you won't lose anything if you don't eat here. We won't go back to this restaurant if we go to Las Vegas next time. Not worth.
