Tefx_N6A6nrsdj4jHHnbYg Spent about an hour here while waiting for my grandfather who was at the cancer center in the same parking area. I had an extremely pleasant and delicious experience.  Enjoyed fresh (so fresh the french press was brought to my table to press and pour myself) delicious green tea and an apple brie almond salad.  I was a little bit skeptical of the combination of ingredients in the salad but after one bite I was hooked!  The brie wasn't too strong and the julienne'd apples complemented the bitterness of the greens perfectly.   The food was brought out promptly, I didn't even have time to peek completely through one of the many vogue magazines set out in front of two comfortable chairs.  

The ambiance is wonderful, great soft jazz playing in the background, nice varied seating options and perfectly simple little decorations.

Pleasantly surprised at this delightful little cafe, where the ladies working there were almost as, if not more pleasant than the place itself.

**Stayed for long enough to order more - macaroons were lovely as was the capuccino
