v50-nvBCZNf7nCNbyUlQLw After walking by this place what felt like a million times, I was so excited to get to try this place.  I knew the weird quirks (long lines, no sitting until you have ordered, cash only, etc.) and yet was so excited to get in and try the food.  Unfortunately, however, despite the hype, the crepes just weren't great.  Don't get me wrong, they were good, but just good.  The plates and silverware were plastic, the servers were rude, and there was no such thing as atmosphere.  I could be convinced to go back and give it another try if a friend wanted to check it out, but I certainly wouldn't go out of my way to recommend it.... it wasn't that good.
