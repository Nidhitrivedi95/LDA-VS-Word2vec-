0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g I can't say much about Picasso that hasn't already been said. This was my finest dining experience in the US by a good margin (Only a certain meal in Japan can best it). My girlfriend surprised me with reservations here for my birthday. It just so happens I've had my eye on the place since I moved to Vegas as it has earned great praise over the years and is relatively reasonably priced for a place that was recognized as a two star Michelin restaurant when they last rated in Vegas.

I was excited to try the Degustation menu as it had a lot of courses that I wanted to try anyway. Every course was delicious, but I truly enjoyed both the scallop dish and the lobster salad. The lamb was fantastic, and the foie gras was rich buttery goodness.

One of the highlights of Picasso is obviously the view, where you can be up close to the Bellagio fountain shows. I generally think sitting inside is more comfortable, but this is one of those restaurants where you might want to sit outside to enjoy the fountains. That being said, it will be much noisier if you choose that route.

Their dessert menu is actually quite extensive and I went with the mousse cake. I was surprised by the size of the portion, considering that most of the courses were petite. I was given quite the slab of cake! Accompanying it was a nicely written Happy Birthday message as well as a candle. The cake itself was rich and delicious, but a little too much as I couldn't quite finish it. Sometimes fine dining leaves you a little hungry - Picasso probably will not.

Ironically, I read Lena C's review beforehand so I knew that the richness of the menu might get to my tummy, so it was nice to be forewarned!

All in all, this was a fantastic and extended experience that makes you appreciate the effort that they put into the details of the restaurant itself. From the waiters, to the paintings, to the parting present, this is not a meal to forget anytime soon.
