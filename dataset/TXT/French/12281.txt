4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Our waiter was laying on the French accent thing really really thick. I thought he was faking it for the benefit of the tourists, but when he started conversing with the Québécois to at the next table i realized he was legit.  Food was great, the fries that come with the steake frites are a thin chip like version, I'd prefer thicker shoestring ones, but a small quibble.
