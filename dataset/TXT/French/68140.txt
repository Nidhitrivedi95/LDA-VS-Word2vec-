vg55SAkrEmuHpWfIMtJjBQ We were looking for an upscale dinner place while visiting Pittsburgh and settled on Legume.  Its seasonal/daily menus and high reviews seemed too much to pass up.  Legume is next to Butterjoint and although they are technically different places, you can think of Butterjoint as Legume's bar - you can even order off of either menu at both places.

Legume's menu changes over time, so your options may be significantly different, but everything we had was delicious.  We started with the Smoked Bluefish Pate, which  was served with crostinis.  I have not had a Bluefish Pate before (or any kind of fish pate, actually) but this was yummy.  Plenty of smokey flavor and it went well with the bread basket (which came with rye, focaccia and baguette breads) too.

My main dish was a chicken, and I really wish I knew how they cooked this one.  The menu description said "cooked under a skillet", but I've only seen skin so crispy and meat so juicy in fried chicken.  In any case, it was great!  It was served over perfectly cooked rice, escarole, and garlic.  My girlfriend had a Mushroom-Barley Risotto, which was also cooked just right and had a great combination of flavors.

Service was outstanding.  Our waitress took great care of us with our orders and filling up waters.  Overall, great food and decent portion sizes.  A little on the pricey side, but not bad at all for a fancy night out.
