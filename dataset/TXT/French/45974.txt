mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q Went here right after I got engaged and had a really memorable experience! 

We sat at the chefs bar and ordered a few dishes a la carte. Me and my new fiancé shared le fois gras (classic chilled fois gras), lobster bisque and l'hamachi (hamachi sashimi). 

Since we were celebrating we ordered champagne- I was super impressed by their large selection of veuve cliquot- my favourite champagne (!) It was served in matching veuve cliquot champagne flutes too which was a nice touch. 

I particularly enjoyed the amuse bouche- a fois gras parfait. It was so delicious! 

Since I'm from Europe I also really liked the warm, freshly baked French bread that was served prior to the meal.

This restaurant is great as although it is formal, they encourage sitting at the chefs bar which creates a relaxed and less 'stiff' environment. 

L'atelier is my new favourite restaurant for sure!
