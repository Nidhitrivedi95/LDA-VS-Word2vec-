or4UVDjXEEjze3wNPjoAZA This is an update from my previous review. Had to attend a business lunch last week and thought "oh no" when I found out Zinc Bistro was the chosen destination. There were ten people in our party we sat outside in the back garden patio area. As stated in my previous review service was very very slow. No prompt refills on iced tea. Delivery of appetizers, entrees etc... took an exorbitant amount of time to be delivered. It was recommended by another member of the group to try the "Duck Confit" sandwich. Worst sandwich I've ever had! The duck was dry, tasteless, shredded "gunk." The group ordered the mussel appetizer which was served in a flavorless broth. The "Pate Maison" tasted like it was weeks old with, again, no flavor. Other members of the party commented that the food was average at best and overpriced. It's a good thing I didn't pay for this meal out of my pocket. As I said in my previous review, "don't waste your hard earned money at this lousy place."
