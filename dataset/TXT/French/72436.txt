XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q It was a great experience. The food was somewhat tasty. We did the tasting menu with the wine pairing. Cost was close to 2 grand. But we were not in awe of everything. To each's own taste but it was not what I expected for the tasting menu.  

The bread cart was great with many varieties. The dessert was also an impressive display but looks can be deceiving. 

Service was excellent.
