xcmmTXhuMx2fZF2Bt69F4w My wife and I dined here for Sunday brunch, fittingly after I performed at "Bach Beethoven and Brunch" at Mellon Park in Point Breeze.  I had a mimosa and the crab cakes eggs benedict.  The crab cakes were full of lump crab meat and delicious!  The mimosa was the right combination of orange juice and champagne.  My wife had a mimosa and frittata, which she enjoyed as well.  Overall a great experience.  I would like to try this out for lunch some time!
