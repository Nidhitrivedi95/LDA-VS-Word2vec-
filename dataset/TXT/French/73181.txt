xNnZ5ksBY1gwwTV2Btb4Ag Last night we enjoyed one of the best meals we have ever eaten in Montreal. We started with salmon crudo appetizer and a bowl of the chilled asparagus soup with nordic shrimp. Both were absolutely delicious. We paired this with a Hill Farmstead Dorthy Pale Ale. Just when we thought the meal could not get any better the main courses arrived. The expertly prepared Turbot served with a light cream sauce was incredible. The fish was melt in your mouth delicious. The Lobster dish with grilled/smoked asparagus and a spicy mayonnaise was delicious as well. Patrick, their resident beer expert, suggested we have the Brasserie Dupont Cervesia which we absolutely loved. Our server Veronic, was friendly knowledgeable, attentive and passionate about food.
