DJcvnN7BCiqOUAra35xYuA I loved trying this place. You can order two rolls per person and share. The food is fresh and different.  

We sat outside and were approached by two people asking for money. It isn't the fault of the restaurant, but it did make us uncomfortable. But once the weather gets really hot you'd be inside anyway.
