rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Nice atmosphere quick service.  I ordered the salmon salad.  Not a fan of berts but this salad was great.  I ordered an espresso and it as on the table within minutes.  The wine menu is nice and they have a sommelier for a breakfast.  Ate here four times and food was never served hot.  Wonder if on purpose or kitchen too far.  The breakfast is quick and they keep beverages filled.
