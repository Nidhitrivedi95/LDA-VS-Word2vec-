LjOBNcNNpuewBqSPxYYTJQ It's Amelie's its FRENCH it's a Bakery so why not 5 stars you ask? Well maybe if I hadn't experienced the Noda location this would've been an easy 5star review however knowing that the customer service, the taste of the pastries, the crowd, the hours are all better in Noda I have to take the star-rage down on this one.

The pros: Conveniently located for me and my family 
Quick French Fix (pastry)
Very easy on the eyes 

The cons: The cost
Hours 
Taste 
Variety at all hours 

I could go on and on but I won't, I like Amelie's and will return to this one when convenient but if I had to choose and time isn't an option I will head to Noda especially since I can go any time of day or night and get a sweet fix as they are 24hr.

The people working here are nice (not as nice as Noda staff) but definitely friendly with good customer service.
