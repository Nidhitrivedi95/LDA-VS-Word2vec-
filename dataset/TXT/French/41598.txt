kKC7UTcHZM3zLfT97x3msg I was in here recently while traveling through town. I have been following this restaurant on Instagram and wanted to come in and try it. I'm so glad that I did. This restaurant far exceeded my expectations. Every dish from appetizers to the main course is dealt with tender loving care. The flavor  combinations of everything that I put in my mouth were astonishing. Started off with zucchini florettes stuffed with crab chef special they melted in my mouth. Then had the grilled white asparagus appetizer and warm mushroom salad  every flavor  on that dish paired together so well I specially love the cheeses. Main courses were herb crusted Ontario rack of lamb rack  and St  Jacobs pork loin. The lamb was butchered and cooked  perfectly the flavors of the lamb were absolutely on point. The pork loin was so tender and the crispy belly and maple balsamic on top just set of off. I'm still dreaming of it The dessert was fresh garden strawberry shortcake which was just delicious. In the end they gave us some nice truffles. The service was wonderful the staff was very helpful The lady of the house who is the owner was delightful and came to check on all the patrons to make sure they were enjoying their experience. This was a five star experience for me.
