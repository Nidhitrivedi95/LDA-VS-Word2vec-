Mon Ami Gabi is a restaurant at the first floor of the Paris hotel.  Sitting in the indoor/outdoor patio allows the diner a front seat view of the Bellagio fountain show.  

I adore French Bistros and I have to say, Mon Ami Gabi was surprisingly one of the better ones I have been to. Their standard bistro food was right on the money. Warm french bread, escargot, pomme frittes, french onion soup and several glasses of Roses - made for a great extended and lazy lunch.  

This restaurant may not have been as "charming" and authentic as the French Bistros I have been to in San Francisco, Napa Valley or New York.  However, Mon Ami Gabi serves solid French Bistro food - a good alternative to indoor- buffet style restaurants on the strip.
