ysJo5Jdo29XOBCnKrbUKWg J'adore Paris 66. This is probably one of my favorite French restaurants. It's not the decor or ambience, though I love both. It's just the way I feel eating there and the food. I have had just about every crepe on the menu and still enjoy every one of them. I have always been greeted warmly by the entire staff, and they have graciously accommodated even my more bizarre requests (like asking to move tables because I liked a different location better...after already ordering). 

I highly recommend this East End gem.
