xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g The service here is A1. The waiters are very attentive and work for their money. You feel like a million bucks here alone. Then the food was just fantastic. I had the Parmesan crusted chicken and would recommend. The cheese appetizer was certainly one for learning but delicious. Waiter recommended a $100 bottle and got confused, he understood we wanted a cup and not a bottle, but charged us for both. It ended up expensive. You get what you pay for.
