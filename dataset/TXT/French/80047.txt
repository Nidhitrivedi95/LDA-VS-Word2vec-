ZV7t55UEx1LnBOWqTrutSw Came to Montreal on a business trip and found the restaurant when searching online for "Farm-to-Table, Montreal". Made reservations for two for supper. 

Service was the best it could be, with our sever Claudie being incredibly friendly and helpful. The Head Chef and Chef de cuisine exchanged bringing our dishes to the table and explaining their process in creation and how certain dishes reflected David's (Head Chef's) origins in Dublin. Very thoughtful and attentive. 

This is impressive alone for me--but then the dishes were incredibly flavorful and thoughtful. everything was delicious, but the highlights were the Butternut Squash soup and the Smoked Venison. I always thought that butternut squash soup in general was a bland soup, but this had over the top butternut flavor and the pickled mushrooms balanced the richness extremely well. The venison had a very strong smoke and tea flavor and was cooked to perfection, and i could of just eaten a bowl of the Jerusalem Artichoke sauce alone. 

Very impressed, and if I'm ever to come back to Montreal, I will immediately make reservations here again. I always feel fortunate to come to restaurants with this much passion in there food. Thank you EVOO!
