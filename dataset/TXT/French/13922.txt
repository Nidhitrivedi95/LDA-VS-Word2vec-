50-xiTYmE6NERi-yJ6NvHw One of the upscale French restaurants under the O&B arm. I've been here twice for the past 2 years, due to the restaurant's central location.

Pros:
- Great steak tartare as well as some other signature French dishes. If you're craving some good French food, this is a place to check out.
-  Buck-a-shuck $1 Oysters on Tuesday nights - one of the many places in the Downtown core that has good oyster deals on Tuesdays. 
- Lovely patio. I love this part of Front street as it is more quaint and calm compared to other parts of the Downtown core. 

Cons:
- In my opinion, many of the dishes are overpriced. Most entrees are well above the $25-$30 price range. The last time I came for buck-a-shuck oysters and a few sides including a small Chacuterie board and the goat cheese tart to share with my friend, we both ended up paying around $30 without any drinks or feeling full. 
- Service was mediocre on my last visit. The table beside us was receiving many bread refills, while we received none. When the waiter served our Chacuterie board, some of the items fell off the plate but were not replaced. I also noticed some of my dishes were dirty on the patio. Overall, the service does not match the price charged on the menu.
