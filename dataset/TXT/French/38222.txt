JezHN-9KKLTMbojq00VP0g Meh. A lot of hype, not a lot of flavor. We went here after hearing stellar reviews from several friends and the Internet. We had high expectations as we had been told how fantastic it was. Went on a Friday night, there was an hour wait. Totally expected and no big deal, walked down the street to Johnny Mangos for a drink and came back.

Our server is the sole reason for the 2 stars, and a decent appetizer. Our server was super sweet and very knowledgable of their menu and even suggested a drink for me to try. Really really nice. For an appetizer we ordered the Bruschetta. It was good, nothing special. I ordered the gnocchi, and was very excited about it. When it arrived it looked promising. However, it was BLAND. No taste whatsoever. The bf liked his meal, but didn't rave about it.

Meh should have stayed at Johhny Mangos down the street.
