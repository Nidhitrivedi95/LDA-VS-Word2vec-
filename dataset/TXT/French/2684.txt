0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g The. Big problem was that I did not look at the menu before booking. I never would have made the reservation based upon the extremely limited choices available . This restaurant is more like Ludo's  Trois Mec restaurant where you have almost no choice.

That being said, the food was average for a restaurant with this reputation. We ate the tasting menu at Michael Minna the night before and found it much better than Picasso.

The fish was sent back as too dry, too salty, and otherwise tasteless. The deserts were less than exciting.

I found it way overpriced for what it delivered.
