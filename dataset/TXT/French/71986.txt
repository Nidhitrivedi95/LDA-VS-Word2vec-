XI3iNUgChOfJk5ppjKVEQQ On the advice of the hotel concierge my group went to dinner here. We ate at the bar and Kristoff. He is an amazing bartender and a lot of fun. The food was phenomenal. We had steak tartar and oysters for an appetizer and the tartar in particular was great. The ribeye with chimichurri was to die for. I can't recommend this place highly enough!
