fKDyiIcFLkl-_5d4JsvBXA Great atmosphere! Although restaurant inside is great my husband and I chose to eat outdoors to see the pedestrians and traffic. Ultimately, this was entertaining to us. We both ordered the Special entrecôte - one with soup and one with the walnut salad. Both were amazing! The soup was refreshing with hints of onion or leeks and the salad had a light and tangy dressing with the best walnuts. I asked for medium rare steak but more rare and it came out perfect. The sauce over the steak is s butter Dijon but more butter than Dijon and I'm in love with this sauce! I would highly recommend dining here.
