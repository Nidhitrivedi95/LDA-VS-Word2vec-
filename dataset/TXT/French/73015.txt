XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q Me and my wife's first 3 Michelin star restaurant. Bottom line is we've been to 1 Michelin star places with much better food. The decor and preso was all very nice but nothing about the food was innovative.  I had veal cheeks drenched in what was essentially Tom Yum soup and scallops in Thai coconut curry.  The food is not bad by any means... just not worth the $$$$.  
One positive note was the dessert was very good.
Overall, very overpriced for what you get.
