2gUbgbdJ7IFSbicBXlSchw I showed up solo on a Friday night, with no reservation, hoping to get a spot at the bar, which was full with "reserve" tags. Luckily the staff accomodated me with the condition that I wrap up before 7:30. I could not refuse that!

I had the chicken liver pâte with pistachios, pot au feu, a couple glasses of wine, and some conversation with other customers...fantastic...very helpful staff, suggested the menu items. Oh, the cornichons are really good, too!

No doubt I will return to L'Express whenever I can make my way back to Montréal.
