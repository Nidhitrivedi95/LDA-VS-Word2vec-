9ot8oInkYZTt6wkkGe__vQ Typically this is one of the best restaurants in the city. I've visited several times and it's everything I was expecting and more.

That being said, the recent winterlicious was very underwhelming. They were woefully understaffed, the tables were shoddy and wobbly, and the dinner was decent at best... given the tier of the restaurant.  

You get what you pay for I guess.
