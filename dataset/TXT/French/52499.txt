q0n4I-zqiI47xispOqc1lA Im visitin pittsburgh all the way from europe, my favorite kinda food is crepe, and i was wondering if i can find a good place to have some in the united states, couple of my friends told me to go to Caffé Mona and try it. so i went there today for the first time. It is so european, cozy, such a lovely place, they have too many good options on the menu and its not that pricey at all. I had a mr green crepe its asiago mozarella feta with some fresh baby spinach in it. That was soo good.. comes with side salad and costs me only 9$. Server was so kind and quick. During my pittsburgh visit i believe this place will be on top of my restaurant list. They have a beautiful patio with umbrellas i love it.. you all gotta see this place
