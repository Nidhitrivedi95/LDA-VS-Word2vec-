xBxDMEkFK5GBhiy-8gGE9w I heard about this place but I wasn't looking for it when I was walking around the area.

Stopped in for a quick snack of sorts, I was going out to dinner later on with some friends but needed something to hold me over.  What is better for a quick snack than some oysters and a beer? The oysters were pretty fresh but they were pretty pricey, I wish they had some more beer choices to accompany the oysters better.  Otherwise I might stop in again in the future if I am in the area.
