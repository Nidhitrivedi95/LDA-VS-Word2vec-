ucgzkl7atsBMGu4gGpmHfw This place is AMAZING! I was here a little while ago for dinner and everything was delicious. Went back for brunch recently - this place has to be one of the best brunch spots in the city. Plus they have a patio!
 
The scones and jam are to die for. I had the shakshuka and it was done perfectly - a rarity in Toronto! The dollop of labneh on top added a nice flavour combo. I will definitely be back!
