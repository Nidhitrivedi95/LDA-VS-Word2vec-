YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g We were walking by and I convinced my group to come eat here as I'd always wanted to try his food after seeing him on TV so much.

I ordered a burger with crab and blue cheese.  Fries, of course.  The burger was Awesome.  But it cost $14!!!!!!!  Yikes.  

I asked about Happy Hour and the waiter said that they offered it at the bar.  The bar was 10 feet away, if even that.  I asked him again, and he confirmed.  You don't get the happy hour at the table, only at the bar.  Ridiculous.  There were only 2 other people in the restaurant at the time.
