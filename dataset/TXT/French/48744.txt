oJZNHz5UUVUgrZwVBVlpYw My wife and I were celebrating our anniversary and stopped here for a drink and an appetizer ahead of our dinner reservation later in the evening.  The ambience is old school and classy, like walking into a bar from the television show Mad Men.  The piano player added a soothing, backdrop that still allowed you to carry on a conversation while enjoying the music.

The cocktails are well made, but not cheap.  My wife and I had the old fashioned and thoroughly enjoyed it.  The quality was that which one would expect of a more upscale bar.  The cheese plate appetizer was tasty and properly portioned.  This establishment is not likely an every day hangout for a lot of the population, but a nice place to catch a drink if the mood strikes you.
