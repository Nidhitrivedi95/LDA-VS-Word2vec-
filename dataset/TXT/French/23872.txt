cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg Yes! as a true foodie, traveler....and fan of Anthony Bourdain, I couldn't help but pass by this popular establishment on our last day in Montreal. Situated off the beaten path from the busy St Denis. We walk in around 10pm, no reservations (pun intended). Still got a seat. 

It's funny since we just came out of dinner (albeit bad one) an hour and half prior to our arrival. We felt the need anyways to spend some time here. Our order turned out to be light one. Sipped on some fine wine. Then settled for apps like  Cromesquis de foie gras (a little fois gras shot) 
and Saucissettes fumées marinées (little hot dog smoked sausage) with a side of their fries, made in duck fat. It all turned out pretty good. 

Peaking at the tables next to us, we witness the infamous duck in a can meat. Looked yummy. In fact, every single dish we saw looked good. Just wished we had a larger appetite. 

 Lovely modern simple decor. Service was friendly, laid-back but still very attentive. We even peaked at the main chef (forget his name) walking back in forth in his kitchen & talking some pics with fan. 

If ever in this area again, will be sure to hit this spot.
