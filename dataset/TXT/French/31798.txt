GS06uO84yKQpa7oezgVZgQ This restaurant is tucked away and very nice. The food and service are excellent. Really top class, bread is made daily and the menu changes daily too. There are always fresh ingredients. Dishes are such as beef burgoine, a variety of fish dishes, coq au vin. It is a truly wonderful place to go for a meal. It is slightly more expensive than other restaurants perhaps but worth it.
