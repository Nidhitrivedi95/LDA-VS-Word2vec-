Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA We stay at Mandalay each year for an annual golf tournament, so MIX lounge is conveniently upstairs. Its definitely not a club like the others along the strip... Just a chill place to grab drinks. The dance floor is small, and pretty much non-existent. The crowd is older... No young hotties. The DJ wasn't that great the last time I was there either.. He didn't know how to transition songs! But the view is great though... Cant get a better view of the strip than from MIX! They also have an open-air balcony if you wanna get some fresh air...
