aervNtqzrKf0CGrFo4xfKw My wife and had our anniversary dinner at Le Papillon, and we were not disappointed. 

The restaurant has a nice casual decor about it, and a patio upstairs with a separate menu. 

We sat downstairs because the poutine was on the downstairs menu. One of the better poutines I've had outside of Montreal. 

Everything we had on the menu was exceptional. The bartender made the best Caesars (very hard to find a good caesar in a restaurant). 

The staff were very friendly and knowledgable.

Overall a great experience. Will be again.
