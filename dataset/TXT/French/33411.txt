I will tell you that this kind of place is rare and I'm glad it is so close to my home, I will definitely be coming back for more again and again. 

Make sure to try their soups and their excellent sandwiches, I know I know it is just a Cafe but believe me when I tell you that for food that is made so well and with so much care it deserves to be praised and talked about. Oliver gave us such good service and attention that I'm willing to share with everyone the beauty that it is the Baguette Cafe. 

Enjoy......
