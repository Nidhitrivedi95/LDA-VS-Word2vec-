Ht-_i0UAq7YDBaqJwcQMdQ Honestly, the biggest standout to me about this restaurant was how noisy it was. It's very cozy, but also hard to hear anyone at your table. I wasn't expecting this.

The food was very good and/but definitely on the heavy side - maybe this was partially due to our ordering, but we also found the portions to be very large. The pork risotto was so rich that we would have been happy to have shared a quarter of it, even without the foie gras, which felt over the top to me.

But I really enjoyed the boar, which was sizable but NOT over the top. We asked for a wine pairing to encompass people who ordered boar as well as those who got fish, and were given a suitably subtle red, which was decent but not exciting. The desserts were more exciting, but overall we just weren't blown away.
