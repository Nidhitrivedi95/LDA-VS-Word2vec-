O3OH5IEFMPtz7mPKakPZ3Q My friend recommend this place and to be honest this place is diamond in the rough.  Possibly worthy of Michelin. As good or better than Nobu in las vegas. Must try or make it your must restaurant every time you in vegas...so good literally every dish is guaranteed to melt in your mouth.
