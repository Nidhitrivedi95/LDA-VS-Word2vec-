jSfnItqaOnEp2nenVF7fCg I am really sad to have to give this place a 1 star. We have been here quite a few times and have had wonderful service and been treated great, however when we came in today it was a different story. Being military we have always received a military discount on out bill on previous visits. When we asked today they informed us that they didn't have military discount. When we let them know that we had been offered it in the past the waitress, Kim, seemed annoyed by our request. When we gave her the military ID she then preceded to say, very loudly for others to hear, that our ID was expired, which was not true. When we showed her the expiration date on the ID she once again was rude and disrespectful. Unfortunately the unprofessional and rude behavior of this waitress, Kim, towards our military members has deterred us from ever visiting this place again.
