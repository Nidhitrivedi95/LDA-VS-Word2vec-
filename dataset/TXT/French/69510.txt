WOd8tWsh2Yt_osHv-ngx_w Eggs Benedict were fantastic. The breakfast poutine also delicious. I ordered both, but either was more than enough. I'd order the poutine by itself for a nice filling breakfast. Service was good, it was Saturday morning so it was packed, but they do a quick turnaround so no waiting.
