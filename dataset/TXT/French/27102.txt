Dcj69NZJnbJhK-YHP_nULA I thought dining here was an interesting experience, although it definitely didn't exceed my expectations.

My wife and I went for lunch on our first visit to Madison together. We started the meal off with some frites and dipping sauce, which were easily the best thing about the meal. As others have mentioned they truly are amazing. On the other hand the rest of the meal was far from spectacular. I ordered the Smoked Salmon BLT and did not enjoy it as much as I expected to. It wasn't very good at all, so I didn't even end up finishing it. My wife got the Caprese, which she liked a little better than I liked my sandwich, but also thought it was a letdown after the appetizer.

The service was decent, but I don't remember anything special about it. The restaurant feels kind of cozy though and the Belgian theme is neat, so I wouldn't mind coming back again. Next time I visit I may just come in to get some of those frites as a snack! They were so good!
