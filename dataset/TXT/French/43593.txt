m4PW-GMc8JOU5nmMYncu-Q Le Lab was on my bar bucket list and I can say that my life is now complete. Once you push the red curtains guarding the entrance aside and walk into the bar you're immediately transported to another era. Dim red lights are illuminating this Moulin Rouge-like bar, the bartenders are taking shots while playing with fire, and the brouhaha is pouring into your ears - what a time to be alive.

Once seated, the menu was handed to us along with a glass of water. Exactly what we needed since Le Lab was our third bar stop and dehydration from the alcohol was kicking in? Anyways, my pick was the Tiger Thai Collins which was probably the best cocktail I've ever had. The coconut added a creamy richness, the lime gave the drink a citrus zing, and finally, the hot pepper delivered the knockout punch into heaven. It was so good that I wanted to try other drinks but it was time for our next bar stop.

Expertly well thought drinks accompanied with crazy butt clenching pyromaniac stunts, a definite return. Truly a must try bar if you're in Montreal.
