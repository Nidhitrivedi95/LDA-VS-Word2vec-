jo4KmAqlZ7vxjHIP7IIkAw Lovely restaurant with a wonderful and relaxed atmosphere. I had the Soup du jour, which happened to be Potato Leek. It was just what the doctor ordered for a blustery cold winter day here in the city. The waiter was attentive, and the soup was delicious!  The menu is extensive. This place is very relaxing, and ideal if you want to catch up with friends.
