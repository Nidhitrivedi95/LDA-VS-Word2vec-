rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Definitely not impressed. Service was LAME server knew nothing about French wine; neither did the "expert" that took over 30 minutes to come to our table to merely read the wine list to us. The server who brought the seafood appetizer was equally clueless. He informed us that Tamale Bay (sic) was "somewhere on the East Coast".  Add to that the oysters were poorly shucked; devoid of nectar and still attached to the shell.

No plates for the bread & pistachios??? that came out after 20 mins. Food was really good, not fabulous. Two in my party got a special, the lamb shank; the most impressive item of the evening. 

Sorry Mr Keller, you need MUCH better staff.
