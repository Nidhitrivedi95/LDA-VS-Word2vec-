mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q So I don't normally write reviews but I thought for a place like this I should.  My husband and I were in town for a convention and this was the place we could not stop talking about for weeks before arriving.  We were so excited to eat here.  The  hostess sat us at the counter since it was just the two of us which was fine because we got to see all the food being prepared.  We ordered a drink each and about 10 different items on the menu so we could taste as much as possible.  We noticed thru out the evening the waiter did not refill our water with out asking and left our dirty plates in front of us for extremely long periods of time.  We thought it ti be strange that the two couples on either side of us always had their plates cleared and water glasses full.  I can get past that I have worked in restaurants before and I look past slow service.  What I can not look past is a HAIR IN MY FOOD.  That is the grossest thing ever!!!!!!  The worst thing about it was that the chef, manager or waiter never apologized for it.  They made me a new dish and went along their business.   I think when you pay $500 for a meal and there is a hair in one of your dishes it should be addresses.
