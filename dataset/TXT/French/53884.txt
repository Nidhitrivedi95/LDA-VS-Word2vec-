qnFdBp12seAxwe2_iHM2bA Ah sweet Laloux! Bright and simply stilish, mirrors and crispy white table cloths. Impeccable and unpretentious service. Beautiful list of wines. Laloux offered classically perfect bloody Caesar and survived the Old Fashioned test. The dishes rates of my dining companions varied from very good to excellent. I personally regret I had only few oysters, they were not only delicious, but chucked as I like them. I had the smoked mackerel instead of ordering more oysters and it was nicely prepared, but nothing to rave about. If you want to rave about an appetizer you must have the foie gras, served with solid scrape of honey comb. The beat salad is not only delicious but so aesthetically arranged that some relatives and friends were reluctant to eat from it. My main dish was the yummy venison, the accompanying squashes, mushrooms and other ingredients were blending so well with the meat. And if you order dessert don't forget that the lemon tart is one of the best things that can happen during your dinners of 2016, alternatively just get the twenty years old Armagnac!
