rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Came here for dinner during my last Vegas trip. I ordered some sort of strip steak dish with au gratin potatoes and my friend got the pork shoulder special. Both entrees came out fantastic - cooked perfectly as requested and crusted well without being burned. My steak in particular was very juicy and tender.

The other items we got were pretty good as well - we tried foie gras for the first time, and I think I am now addicted. It came out in a little jar and when eaten with toasted bread, it was delicious. A super rich, buttery flavor that was not overwhelming. I'm curious to see if its this good when I go to France later. We also ordered the beef cube appetizer which was tasty, but not memorable or worth it.

We got a beer each as well.... I think they were $9 a glass. After doing the math, I ended up spending about $100, which is pretty pricey. But I left feeling satisfied with my meal.

On another note, the ambience was very nice for a date - a little bit loud for my liking though.
