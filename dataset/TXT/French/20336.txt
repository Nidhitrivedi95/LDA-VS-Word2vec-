However, the experience overall has been negative.  Bought a restaurant.com gift certificate for Zebra.  Gave it to the waiter when we first arrived.  He knew we intended to use it.  Both my date and I ordered the full meal deal that included the salad, meal, and dessert.  Well when it came time to order dessert, we were informed that the meal deal wasn't included in the gift cert. because it "cannot be combined with any other offers."  He waited until after we had ordered the most expensive parts of our meals to tell us.  So we had to pay regular price for everything and cancel the dessert.  Never offered to speak to a manager and never mentioned anything about the meal not being included until after we ordered and ate 2/3 of it.  

Instead of making a scene at the restaurant, I elected to email them at a later time. That was 6 months ago.  Still no response.  I have, however, been added to their mailing list.  Nice business you got there.
