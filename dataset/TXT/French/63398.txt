Chicken livers and frisee salad also were great. Moules Frites were perfect and the scallops were tender, cooked just right and nice amount. The pork plate, which consisted of a brined ham slice, pork belly, pork sausage gave you a taste of several types of pork and all excellent.
Wine list is fairly priced and even though they were out of what we originally ordered the server came up with a different bottle that worked very well.
