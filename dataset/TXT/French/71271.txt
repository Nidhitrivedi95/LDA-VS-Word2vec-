xcmmTXhuMx2fZF2Bt69F4w Small, but trendy bistro type restaurant. With its size it can get crowded and loud pretty quick. Not a good place for children or groups over 6. Other than that, the food is fantastic! Very tasty and somewhat unique menu, which applied to the appetizers, entrees, and deserts alike. Try something new each time and you'll still have a great meal!
