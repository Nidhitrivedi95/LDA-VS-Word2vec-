YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g I ate there Friday, February 12.  

I was looking forward to this experience since seeing the chef in action on Top Chef Masters.

I can truly say, this restaurant is a MUST.  OMG, it was truly a spectacular experience. 

I had the luxury 4 course pre fix dining menu and my husband had the lobster.  His lobster, we both agreed was the most delicious lobster we have ever had.  My meal started with the most magnificent Truffled Onion Soup.  It was perfect.  Then I had the chorizo stuffed sea bass.  It was the perfect combination.  At first I thought the chorizo would overpower the fish, but it was the right combination, it was well balanced.  I then had the BEST filet mignon ever, it was amazing.  The perfect finish was the chocolate souffle, which I am serious, I could not eat it standing up.  Truly a magnificent experience and exceeded all my expectations.  it is a bit pricey, but worth every penny.
