lY3XZS7RJrGzZtyjWW3tOQ Good, attentive service...Warm (well, a little chilly in temp, but cozy) ambiance...Good food.

Had a little ladies lunch out and here is what we enjoyed:

Shrimp and Goat Cheese Melt - It was good, lots of shrimp and lots of goat cheese - kinda oily.
Salmon with Wild Blueberry Sauce - GREAT salmon for the price - blueberry sauce was really tasty
Beef Short Rib - Very, very tender beef.  Fell apart on the fork (good thing) with the most amazing mustard molass sauce reduction thing. 
Citrus Crusted Chicken - Pretty good for a chicken dish.  Superb mashed potatoes.

Dessert - pretty tasty chocolate/caramel fondue - came with very fresh fruit.  The pastries (breads) to dip could have been fresher.  The fondue could have stayed hotter.

All in all, this may have sounded like a critical review - but I really enjoyed the experience.  I just think this place has A LOT of potential, so I hope that the owners are reading Yelp and being responsive to customer feedback.  I'm giving it four stars...But it's currently sitting at a 3 1/2 with room to grow.

Oh!  And we got our bread...The waiter told us it didn't have rosemary - it has a lot of spices, but not rosemary.  It's good and he kept it coming.  Thanks!
