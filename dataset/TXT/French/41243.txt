kGOr_D-LNpgZ2M9N8TT4QQ I work across the street from here, and came in recently for lunch.  I had the croque madamme and it was really, really good.  Very decadent and large in size.  The fries were very good, exactly what I want from a french bistro.

The service was attentive and pleasant.  I will return.
