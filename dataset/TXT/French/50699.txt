OZC42gnhlJ_auXduDRfMoQ I really like this place.  So, why only 3 stars - service.  The food is extremely good.  The Bison burger was sincerely incredible.  Omelet in black truffle sauce - wow!!  Very good coffee.  But, the service is inconsistent.  First time - excellent.  Second time, slow....almost as if they did not have enough help.  They're getting started in this location, and I hope they get this issue fixed because otherwise its a 5 star experience.  I'll be back - often - and I'm sure its going to get better.
