xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g Where do I start??  This experience was one of the best that I have had in Vegas!  It was my birthday dinner and we had an absolutely fantastic time.  The meal was so delicious and unique.  Our server, Jorge, was so attentive and knowledgeable.  He really made the experience so much better.  My husband called ahead for flowers and a photographer, so it was just a gorgeous table.  The only drawback is that we could see the fountains from where we were seated, but the sunset and skyline were beautiful.  We will definitely come back again and again!
