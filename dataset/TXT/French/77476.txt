YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g Was in Vegas last week, and had the opportunity to eat here twice. Once with a business team, and after that, selecting it as the spot for dinner with a colleague of mine. 

On both occasions, everything I had was amazing. They do the "small plates" things, which is great because you can try more variety. From the green beans to the pork belly flat bread - each dish stands on its own and delights the tongue.   The wine list is amazing as well. 

If you'll be in Vegas, I highly recommend adding Fleur to your dinning list.
