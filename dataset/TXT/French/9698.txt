4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Made reservation through opentable & came here for lunch last Friday. Staff were very attentive. Our server made sure we didn't pour our carafe of Frangria (reallliee good) ourselves :D  Great view, service, price, & food!!!

On to the foodies we had:

*Mussels Marinière* --  Absolutely deee-lishcious!!!  Best mussels dish I've yet had in Vegas. To savor it all (down to the last few drips of sauce) we dipped the remaining of our fresh baguette into their white wine & herb sauce. Yuumm!! 

*Seafood Crepe* -- Excellent dish! Nice sized scallops & shrimps - perfectly cooked. Best eaten when served fresh out from the kitchen.

*Grilled Salmon & Spinach Salad* -- The blueberries & walnuts went so well with this salad! Big portion salmon - flavorful, not dry & grilled just right on a semi warm bed of spinich.


HELLSYA i'll be returning to dine at this place again... well the next time i'm out here for Vegas~!  ^^;
