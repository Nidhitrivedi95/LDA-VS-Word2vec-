rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Bouchon again! After checking into the room, we decided our first food destination should be Bouchon. We had such a great experience in Bouchon at Napa Valley that we wanted Bouchon again. It's great how we only need to walk a little to get there (we were staying at The Palazzo). My recommendations:
- duck salad (very small portion): I don't think they have this everyday but if they do have it, order it!
- coq au vin: this one's a classic - it's a little on the saltier side though
- steak frites: another classic - steak was nicely cooked and they give you loads of french fries (make sure you pack the left over fries to go because it'll be good drunk-food)
- truite amandine - superbe!!! This one is a must try! Fish was very buttery, topped with fresh haricots verts! 
I paired my steak frites with a glass of champagne - perfection.
How can I forget dessert!
- Bouchon brownies (can't remember the exact name): this is not on their usual menu: it's warm brownies with melted chocolate inside topped with peanut butter ice cream and garnished with candied nuts - another must have!
- ile flottante: this one's okay. I personally don't quite like meringue unless they have the texture of Pavlova

Bouchon has never disappointed me. Our server was great - explained everything in detail and that was a perfect opening dinner to our Vegas trip, even though my wallet has already started to cry (our total came to around $350 for a party of 5). sigh. It is Vegas afterall.
