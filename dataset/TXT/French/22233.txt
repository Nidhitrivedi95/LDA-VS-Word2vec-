BSmqxPbQglQwP2R56OqOag Went for brunch today.  Really nice bottomless bloody marys!  Also loved the Spanish skillet.  The wife had a nice chicken salad which had really nice flavor.  Paired perfectly with her glass of sauv blanc.  We also shared some pancakes which were nice and fluffy.  My dad had a steak and eggs which was cooked to a perfect medium rare with 2 sunny side up eggs, and my mom had the bolognese.  The only piece of advice that I can suggest is that the Spanish skillet should come with some toast for sopping up the sauce.  Other than that it was a perfect brunch!
