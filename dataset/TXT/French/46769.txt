nkHaix6KenApS8M-liZsCQ Stopped in here for a martini prior to a movie the other day.  The place was empty...but the staff was extremely polite.  Bartender prepared a fantastic specialty cocktail for the fiancé.  She was very pleased with it. The "art photography" behind the bar is terrible.  It's like a novices interpretation of high fashion art and obviously an amateur with misguided high aspirations of his/her own talent.  God forbid a place purchases high caliber works for a space.  Buying a digital camera and hiring some low grade "models" off of Craigslist does not make you Man Ray no matter how much you have to drink.  I have had mixed dining experiences at the restaurant ranging from spectacular to terrible.  I guess it depends on the evening.  I have definitely had more good experiences than bad.  The wine selection is competent and the kitchen does not shy away from special requests even when busy which is a major plus.  Specials are often very appealing and tasty. The decor is cultured and better than most if not all other options at the Biltmore.
