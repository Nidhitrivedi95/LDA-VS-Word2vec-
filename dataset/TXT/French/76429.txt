Tableau is located in the lobby of the Tower Suites at the Wynn.  The bright light decor aims to wake you up after a night of winning/losing, dining/drinking, and whatever other behaviors Las Vegas inspires.  The staff at Tableau are attentive and knowledgeable.

For lunch, I had the baby kale and romaine caesar with grilled shrimp.  What a great lunch!  The greens were fresh and crisp.  The dressing was tangy and savory but not over-powering.  The shrimp were enormous and probably more aptly described a prawns (though tasted like shrimp!).  The lunch rolls were freshly baked and delicious.

Overall, Tableau is a phenomenal lunch spot.  I'd go again in a heartbeat!
