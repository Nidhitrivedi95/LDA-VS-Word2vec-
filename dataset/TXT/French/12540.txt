4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I love this restaurant, and I don't even eat steak!

Long before my dad worshiped the SW steakhouse, this is where we could come during our tri annual trips to Vegas. I have probably eaten here a dozen times, and everyone I have recommend it to, loves it.

Even though I don't order steak, I have tried it here, with the blue cheese reduction...yum.

Honestly, I could have the warm bread, butter and wine and probably be just fine. 

Everything we have ever ordered has been awesome, I had the chicken last time we were there and their version of mac and cheese. I'm pretty sure I scraped every ounce of cheese of that dish...

ENJOY
