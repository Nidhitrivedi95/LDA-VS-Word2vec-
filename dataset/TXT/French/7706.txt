4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw As a Las Vegas resident i was lucky enough to eat here a dozen times. Ive taken few dates here and even took my mom for mothers day. Food is always delicious service is quick and pleasant. Prices are just right for gourmet food (especially during happy hour)! I always get patio table because i can watch the fountain show. Defiantly would rate it as one of my top choices for eating out with style. I recommend this pace to everyone including YOU!
