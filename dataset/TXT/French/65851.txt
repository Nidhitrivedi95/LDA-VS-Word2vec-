ucgzkl7atsBMGu4gGpmHfw I had a very peasant experience w Peter Pan Bistro. From the moment I was seated, I could tell that their service was going to be top notch. Throughout the servers were very attentive and polite.

The decor of this place is quite interesting. From the abnormally upright booths to the wall rugs with deer heads, I could not quite figure out the theme for this place. 

The food was AMAZING. I ordered the Squash and Pumpkin soup as well as the Fall Barley Risotto, and let me tell you I was impressed. Not only was the presentation impressive, but also the complexity of the flavors. The soup was sweet, smooth, with a nice touch of sour taste with the pickled carrot. The texture of the risotto dish was my favorite, although I was also delighted by the subtle hint of olive. 

Bravo, Peter Pan, will be back.
