mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q I ate here over a year and half ago and I still recall the experience.  I don't do too much retro-yelping because I'm afraid that the memories will have decayed, but not with L'Atelier.

The restaurant is modern-cozy, mostly red with dark low lights.  There are many small tables on the side and a large bar area with an open kitchen.  You can see the whole kitchen and the entire scope of preparation.  Sitting at the bar is an experience in it self, let alone eating there.

Unfortunately, I was alone for dinner, but then it made perfect sense to seat me at the bar.  It was the greatest experience watching the plates be finished, a meticulous process that took 5 minutes just to garnish the plates just so.  I just love watching excellence in action.

I had a small plate of smoked salmon on creme fraiche as a starter and then John Dorry with chorizo as a main dish.  It was served with a small pot of pureed potatoes that I will never forget.  They were so smooth, so creamy.  My server conspiratorially whispered to me were at least half butter and I could believe that.

Sitting by myself at the bar, I wasn't alone.  There was a journalist (from the same convention) on one side and a young female doctor on the other.  We made small conversation and were shared our amazement of the food.

I had three pots de creme for dessert that were wonderful.

Someday, when I can convince my wife to come to Las Vegas with me, we will eat here.  Watching the food preparation was great and the food was better.
