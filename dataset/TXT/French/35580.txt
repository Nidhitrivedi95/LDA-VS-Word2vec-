htQgj-ANQpZGpIpkkrEmyQ Having heard about this place on Instagram, I've always wanted to try it out. I ordered the chicken and waffles. I loved the dish. The highlight was definitely the fried chicken. It was a bit crispy. The waffle was okay.  Overall, I was very impressed.

My friend also ordered the inspire burger with the confit fries. The fries were amazing and I definitely recommend ordering it. I'll be looking to get this the next time I go.   

I definitely recommend booking ahead of time, as it is a popular restaurant.
