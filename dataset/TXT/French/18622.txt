AcWAop2TvCRp-DhWl7qR6w I order the same thing every time I go out for breakfast since I'm in the search for the best eggs Benedict in montreal. I would give pèlerin Magellan the number two spot based on their sauce and number one based on their plate. The eggs had caramelized onions in the mix and the fresh fruit on the plate was the good stuff... pineapple, strawberries, watermelon... many breakfast places break my heart with soggy melon and warm grapes. I wish they had a 1 egg option though as two is usually too much for me. Regardless, is come back for sure. Yum!
