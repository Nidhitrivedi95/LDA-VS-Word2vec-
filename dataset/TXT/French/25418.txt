Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA My 1st visit was on a whim.  We showed up with no reservation and were seated in a corner, which of course sucks cause MIX has the BEST view of the city in my opinion. However, because it was a random visit my BF & I looked like total bums, so no biggie. 

We went with the tasting menu & wine paring. It was fantastic! But holy crap was I full, and really drunk! 

The 2nd visit was on Valentines Day, (made a res this time) the place was packed, we were not seated in the bum corner, but I think I would have rather. Our seats were so close to the other tables we might as well have been on a double date! 

We again asked for the tasting menu, but it wasn't the same. They had a set menu for V day. Sill good. 

I suggest making a reservation. :) asking for a window seat, ordering the tasting menu and settling in for a nice night!
