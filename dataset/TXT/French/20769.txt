AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw Service: The lady behind the counter was really nice.  I was hoping to meet the Pastry Chef himself, but apparently he left...Sad...However, she was very helpful and was able to help me out with every question I had.

Food: The macarons, Mille Feuille, and gelato was amazing.  Had the right amount of sweetness to it, the macaron cookie was soft on the inside, the filling was nice and soft...gelato was sweet, the mille feuille had a flaky crust and a cool creamy filling.
