FVY75lAgzS4BKFPnZ8oHeA My boyfriend isn't too big of a fan when it comes to French food simply because of the portion sizes for the price you pay, so it was a great thing that they had a special 9pm menu.. Nicely located in Laurier, it has a very romantic ambiance. Or maybe because we were seated by the windows and it was a rainy night.

Good : The food is excellent, from appetizers to main course. The service was very good too.  The veal tongue slivers will not disappoint! 

Bad : I cannot recall anything bad about this place. 

Bottom Line : Oh, I will definitely return. If you enjoy French cuisine, this is definitely the spot. Great for dates!
