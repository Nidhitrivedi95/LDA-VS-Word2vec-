hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA it's away from the strip, which we didn't expect, in a business park. We had the prosciutto salad and spicy chipotle sandwich. Both DELICIOUS!!! I wish there was one of these in San Diego. Everything was super fresh and just tasted so great. We also had the Broccoli chedder soup which was a bit different because it was blended into a puree, still delicious!!
