pmoIMK8zGWvKsVOPDBYfzg Hands down one of my new favorite restaurants in Vegas. It was so good we had to come back. The service was excellent especially Alfredo. The wine list is on a ipad, how cool is that? So you just click a cocktail and it tells you exactly whats in it. For apps I got the beef carpaccio and my husband got lobster bisque, both were awesome. For dinner I had the chicken in some delicious sauce and the hubby got the duck, he was happy that it wasn't super heavy like some places. For dessert I had the crime brûlée. Even the drinks were outstanding, I had the lemon pomegranate martini. When we came back two days later Alfredo said he remembered us because of my smile, love to be charmed! This time we did a Vegas first and shared a cigar in the cigar room which had a beautiful fire place lit and a relaxing atmosphere. I can't wait to go back. Top notch.
