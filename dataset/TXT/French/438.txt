-Mz3M0g6iFZczs6a7ddf5g We were just me and my husband, had no trouble finding the place (which is walkable from downtown Montréal ±15 min.) The place is an old industrial space that was converted, trendy pleasant and comfortable. 
My husband and I arrived a few minutes before our reservations and were seated right away, the greet was very professional as we left our coats at the entrance. We were explained the menu and specialties, opted to share the octopus as an appetizer (a delicious discovery) followed by the lobster risotto for me and the salmon for my husband... which both melted in our mouths! We accompanied our meal with a bottle of Pinot blanc from Wann (highly recommend it! priced at 56$), a private import, and indulged a selection of cheeses to end our meal. 
The whole thing cost us  137 + tx. and service which we thought was a very decent price.
Would definitely go back! :)
