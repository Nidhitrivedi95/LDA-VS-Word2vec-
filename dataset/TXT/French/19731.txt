aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw First: Please note that many people are reviewing the restaurant  NOT the bakery. 
My review is for the bakery. I have been coming here for years, but I am extremely sad to report that my last two visits have revealed that they just don't care any more. 

They seem content to just coast on their laurels selling this stuff to rubes and foreigners 

The coffee is good, but the pastry is where they need to re-focus.  

First, the biggest offender is their Macarons. They served us a nasty hateful hard lump of a cookie last week. This thing was seriously rock hard. They are supposed to be crispy with a slightly softer interior.  That is the WHOLE POINT of the cookie.  When we complained they said "that is the way they are supposed to be, and the softer ones are old" No, no, they are not. You overcooked the crap out of these which formed, essentially, a meringue. 
 I have eaten Macrons across the world and made them myself. I was in Paris a few month ago and took down a half dozen of these from Laduree. I am pretty familiar with this stupid little cookie because my wife loves them. 

Do not insult me by telling me this hammer-substitute is in any way acceptable. They told us to take it up with the downstairs location if we did not like it and refused to refund or exchange the cookie.  Astounding. 

The rest of the menu items have just gone downhill. Their croissants are all but indistinguishable from the stuff they sling at buffets.  The outside should be flakey and the inside tender. Not some glupey congealed mess. You know how I know its a terrible croissant? There was absolutely no flakes to clean up. 

I hope Dominique Ansel opens a location and shows you guys whats up.
