They take the time to introduce you to their well orchestrated menu, and they don't cut any corners when preparing your food. 
This is by far one of the best eateries in Toronto, and it's a must for anyone who is looking to enjoy a well prepared, HEALTHY, and high quality savory crepe. 

My personal favorite is the Big boy, which goes well with their Sugar cane/watermelon juice!

These guys are amazing, and I encourage everyone to try them out.
