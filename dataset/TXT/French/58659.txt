I went last weekend and had a very good salad nicoise - the tuna was fresh and the mix of ingredients was perfect.  I also had a bite of my girlfriends duck which was well cooked but a little too sweet for my liking.  We sat at the bar and the bartender was very friendly, although we could see right into the kitchen and I have to say the cooks did not look overly hygenic. Their uniforms were all dirty and one was wearing a filthy t-shirt that he kept touching.  I have come to believe that open kitchens are really better in concept than reality, we are better off not seeing the inner workings of a restaurant kitchen.  Aside from that though, the ambience was good as was the food.  Also, I htought the prices were very reasonable considering the quality of the food.
