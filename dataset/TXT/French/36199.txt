The coffee selection was great and we had a wide variety of sweet and savory crepes to choose from. Because it's a place that's really small it does get crowded at peak times and even though there was a blizzard out, we did have to wait to be seated. I would go back though for the excellent service, perhaps during a non peak hour.
