YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g Wish we went here for dinner instead of lunch, i liked the dinner choices better, but it was convenient and we wanted to head to the pool afterwards. We ordered a hot dog and a burger. The hot dog was ok,  I expected more. I've had better hot dogs at a cart in the fashion district. The bun was the best part, could barely taste the bacon. The burger was a lot better.
