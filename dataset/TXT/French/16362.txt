7Ug8zCmY6iDTewxWqeYQ2g Lunch Special!!

Le Quartier General was fully packed on a weekday around 2 pm! If you are coming with a group, reservation is strongly recommended! But since I was alone, I just waited a few minute before I got seated.

$20 prix menu with a choice of appetizer and main and if one still have room for dessert is $5. 

With the help of my waiter, I ordered the Tartare of the Day: Scallop and Meat of the Day: Bison with 1/2 frites and salad. Both were well prepared and delicious!! 

Service here is excellent! My waiter is attentive and so friendly!! 

I am definitely going to come back here for dinner as they have prix menu for dinner too!! The menu changes regularly since the ingredients are seasonal and sourced locally!

And I will be making a reservation and yes I will be ordering that foie gras appetizer!!
