T4g4k2OhCTsiqcP-ZXElHQ Went to this place on a Saturday night (walk -in) and they had a seat available right away from a cancelation. The restaurant has a very French vibe.... almost magical ambiance to it, especially in the evening. Our server was charming with is accent and very nice. 

I ordered the pate app. and the mussels main, my husband ordered the burger with Brie cheese. All courses were delicious, only issue was the mussel broth was slightly salty. The meal in total came to $53, awesome! 

I would definitely come back again, even to host a party/birthday. They have great menu items that would accommodate many diets.

Thank you for the quality food and great prices.
