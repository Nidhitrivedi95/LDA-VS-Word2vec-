Menu is awesome and our food (croque madame, kale salmon salad, mushroom soup) was generally very good. The service was mediocre-a trend we found at several places around town this trip. Also, the beignets were not at all what we expected. Instead of puffy donut "pillows" like I've had so many other places, these were heavily fried, crunchy on the outside doughnuts (in an o shape). Would go back but didn't live up to the experiences I've had at Bouchon in LA.
