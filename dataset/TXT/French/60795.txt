SCklYa_jhihWAcfIn-_chg I stopped in today for a highly recommended brunch with a friend of mine, who lives in the neighbourhood and said I would "just LOVE the place". 
Mid-day on a Friday we waited about 10 minutes for a table, not that I minded very much. 
Once seated we got our waters fairly quickly, our waiter was pleasant, all is well. 
I personally found their menu rather limited. Perhaps they switch it out for a more extensive one on the weekend? My friend ordered the beef sandwich, and I the smoked salmon/scrambled eggs with caviar. 
His sandwich looked very lonesome on his plate. No garnish or salad. I'm pretty sure they forgot, as I've seen photos of the same sandwich with the salad along side it. He brought it up, but wasn't too bothered. 
I received a rather small portion of smoked salmon and caviar with my eggs, I don't know why I was expecting the portion size to be generous, as the price-point is on the reasonable to inexpensive side. 
The eggs were alright, but nothing short of what I could of made at home. Same goes with the bread. And the potato portion of my dish, which were shredded and possibly fried? ended up tasting soggy as opposed to crunchy, which was somewhat disappointing. 
The only thing really saving this review would be the lemon tart I ordered to go which was absolutely fabulous. Just the right about of sweet to sharp flavour. and the crust was an ideal thickness. Enough to hold its own taste without being obnoxious. 
Would I go back? Maaaybe. But the best brunch in the city? Definitely not.
