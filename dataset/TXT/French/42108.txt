KWoXY9-R00NY-Rv_MSNwaQ One of the most regrettable dining experiences. As soon as we were seated I could sense something was off. Soon enough I got a taste of the conniving and insulting modi operandi used by the wait staff. Our waiter was completely aloof and acted like he was on crack. he never checked up on us and when he did 'interact" with us, he had the most suspicious look on his face. The only thing that drew me to this tourist trap was the "lobster bisque" displayed on the outside menu. After confirmation from the waiter that the bisque was "truly amazing", I ordered it. When it arrived, I noticed there was absolutely NO lobster in it and it was super thin. I asked the waiter about this and he said the lobster is pureed. Really? You take something with such immaculate texture like lobster and pulverize it? If that really were the case it would not have been so thin. Anyway, I gave it a try and I can honestly say it was the most disgusting soup. Tasted like 80% water, 10% lobster broth and 10% metal from a can. And at $10, this attempt at bisque was just comical. After my one taste and my bf's confirmatory taste, I asked the waiter to take it back.  25 min later, my bf received his steak and fries. The steak was definitely over-sauced to mask its sub-par quality. When the bill arrived, I see that the lobster was not removed. When I inquired, the ignorant waiter said it could not be removed, but don't worry "it can be in place of [his] tip". Haha, did he think we were planning on giving him a $10+ tip? I asked to speak to the manager and he hesitantly went to get him. Some other employee then told me there was no problem with taking the "bisque" off the bill. 
Our waiter was the bald late 20/early 30 year old guy. Note to the owner: you should fire him and work on your menu.
I truly hope people see this review and do not waste their money here.
