w2tr0PA0b3tg8pId0kjM-A I really don't know why there is so much hate here. Sure this is Pittsburgh, but any decent macaron anywhere else will be at least $3. The disadvantage, I guess, is that maybe there are many college/grad students checking this place out? Even so, you shouldn't be popping these macarons like pills anyway.

The macarons were pretty, like they're supposed to be, but I did think that they lacked in taste. The flavors were there, but not as strong as I wanted them to be.

I fell in love with their chocolate cake, Le Royal Chocolat. Get it!
