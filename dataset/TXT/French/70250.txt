x1bjSvpIJTN1KBFhUjOU_g I got recommended this restaurant by a friend and I was certainly wowed by the food and the service was impeccable. We visited on a busy Friday night and the place was buzzing with a mixture of tourists and locals alike. Upon been seated 2 minutes a member of staff brought across some crusty bread ,olives and some lovely salami for us to graze on. The wine was excellent and chilled to perfection. The smoked salmon starter was brilliantly presented and tasted very fresh. For my main course I plumped for the cote de boeuf which was cooked medium exactly how I asked for it with a peppercorn sauce and a side of potato gratin which again was outstanding. The portions are spot on and you definitely get value for money in this restaurant. It is rustic hearty French food in a lovely relaxed environment. I asked for the dessert menu to be polite but spotted the chocolate mousse and was persuaded to try by my dining partner and my oh my am I glad I did. It rounded of a perfect evening very nicely. A warm welcome exceptional service and  great authentic French food and excellent value for money await if you visit this restaurant. I will certainly be visiting again soon. The best meal I have had in Edinburgh.
