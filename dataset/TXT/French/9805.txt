4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Food: The rest of my group didn't love their food here, but I thought my roast chicken with frites was delicious! The chicken was nice and moist and the frites were great to munch on! The bread before our meal was also great, fresh out of the oven.

Price: Not bad at all. My meal was around $25 or so...most dishes were $40 and under. 

Service: Service here was good. Our server was friendly and took care of us.

Atmosphere: Nice and intimate. You can also dine ouside right across from the Bellagio fountains. I liked dining inside though, it was nice and warm.

Location: Located in Paris right in front.
