-Mz3M0g6iFZczs6a7ddf5g My favorite meal in Montreal! The food was so good! All the food was fresh from the kitchen, piping hot! We had the kit of three and foie gras parfait to start. Kit of three is nice, sashimi-like, but not spectacular. Foie gras was really good. Great textures on the plate. The linguini with speck was delicious. Perfectly al dente and a great combination of flavors, savory, slightly salty, and that oomph of umami. I had wished I didn't have to share it. The venison was cooked just right. For dessert,the chocolate cake was a perfect ending. I'm usually not a fan, but this one was rich but not too heavy. Service was efficient. Place was cozy and chic. Loved it.
