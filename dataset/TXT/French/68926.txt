VwZhwflLnTq19aAeFLJHCQ My boyfriend and I went here for the first time tonight after driving by and seeing a write up about it.  We absolutely adore it!  The food was unique and amazing, the service spot on (not overwhelming but perfectly attentive) and the ambience perfectly sweet.  It is definitely our new date spot! We are picky customers and this one should not be missed.  Bernard also came out and said hello, that sweet touch made the experience even more genuine.
