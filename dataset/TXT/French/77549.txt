YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g We stopped in here for lunch before hitting the shark/aquarium exhibit in Mandalay Bay. This place is on the fancier side and is pretty pricy but nothing out of the ordinary for Vegas. Very trendy ambiance and a huge visible wine cellar. 

Service was awesome but in all fairness we did get there somewhat early. By the time we finished and left, the restaurant was a lot more full and when we walked by it after the aquarium, is was packed. 

The food was awesome!  I got the chicken sandwich which was absolutely delicious. I got to try my lady's fish tacos(phrasing) and they were the best I've had to date! The mahi mahi was perfect! Lightly fried to perfection and their light and somewhat zesty lime dressing/sauce was amazing.  Even the fries I got with my sandwich were perfect. In closing, check your bank account and give this place a try. It's well worth the cost in my opinion.
