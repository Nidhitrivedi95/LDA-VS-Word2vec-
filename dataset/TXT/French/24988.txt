Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA We had the restaurant week tasting menu. Out of all the restaurant week meals we did, this one was the best! I should have written this sooner so I could remember the details better, so apologies in advance for the made up names I'm using for the dishes! 

Started out with tuna sashimi appetizers and one of our party got the shrimp cocktail. Tuna sashimi appetizer had TONS of tuna on it. Seriously the portion was huge and an awesome value. Tuna was fresh and tasty. Dish wasn't super exciting or mind blowing.. but no complaints. People enjoyed the shrimp cocktail as well.

For mains we had the chicken, steak, and the cod. The cod was a tad rich and buttery for my taste, but it was well prepared and yummy. Steak was VERY good. For a non-steakhouse, I was very impressed. Chicken diner wasn't very excited by his chicken.

Dessert: the floating island didn't do it for me.. ehhhh.. kinda weird, not that tasty. The candy bar was ok, but not good enough for me to even eat half of. They gave away some sort of fresh baked madeleines with nutella at the end..  it was far yummier than any of the "real" desserts. I advise not to pay for a dessert but just eat the freebie one.. much better. 

View was amazing outdoors, but as many have said, it's so freaking hot in the summer! We dined in september and were miserable. Seriously can't they put out some sort of classy misting system or something.. WAY too hot during the summer! I'm sure it's lovely in october though.
