kGOr_D-LNpgZ2M9N8TT4QQ I love coming here for brunch. The last time I went, I had the quiche of the day, which was pretty good. The crust was perfectly balanced between flaky and rich and the egg part was light and fluffy. The quiche came with salad and a large side of potatoes so I definitely didn't leave hungry. My favourite part of this restaurant is definitely the atmosphere. It's beautiful. I love the ceiling and the floor. In the spring, the flower decorations remind me of The Great Gatsby.
