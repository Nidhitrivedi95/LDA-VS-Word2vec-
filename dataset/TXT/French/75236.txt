My fellow foodie-in-crime and I considered ourselves lucky to snag a table on a Saturday night at 7:00 without a wait. Oh my god, I couldn't believe how many tables were squeezed into this little place! It was so crammed that whenever someone would walk by you had to watch your table and hold onto your drinks. We almost lost our martinis thanks to our neighbor and his swinging jacket. The table on the other side of us eventually did lose a glass of wine from someone getting too close to their table.  I don't know how the servers manage to get through the narrow aisles with food and drinks.   Our server never brought us the bread he promised, our dinner took an hour to get to our table (highly recommend the blackened cod or the keith's pale ale battered fish and sweet potato fries), we had to ask the server where our food was and when it did finally arrive,  he left to get us pepper and came back 10 minutes later.  Our server never came back to see how we were doing or how things were and when our plates were cleared he passed the bill to another server who put it on our table.  Maybe we wanted a dessert? a water refill? maybe coffee?  Nope, they just gave us the bill.  I'm not sure if I would go back - crammed in like sardines with bad service?  Probably not.  There are tons of great restaurants in the city - I won't even miss this one.
