intKyiipUlHDWi_chv0f3A LOVE this place! Right down the street from my house and they allow dogs inside and out!! The turkey sandwich with cranberry spread is amazing, one of the best sandwiches I've ever had! seriously! What a great neighbor to another loved place, civilization. I've only ever gone for lunch but I'm excited to try the wine and cheese board in the evening.
