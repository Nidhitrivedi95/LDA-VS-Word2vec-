WOd8tWsh2Yt_osHv-ngx_w Service was slow/non existent. The mimosa I ordered came out with the food, had to ask the busser for coffee, food came out cold, grabbed our own sauces from server station. We spoke to the manager and he gave us a free smoothie? 

The food was good and portions are generous, but I would not visit again.
