Batifole is a lovely bistro in Riverdale neighbourhood, bordering East Chinatown.  If you like soufflé, this place should be near the top of your to-go list.  My orange-grand marnier soufflé was flawless with a dramatic height, a crusty and delicate top that cracked easily revealing the creamy yet airy centre.  It was devoured so quickly it never had a chance to deflate.  The savoury soufflés were good too, although you might have a tough time choosing between these and other tantalizing dishes.  We particularly enjoyed escargot with chef's special sauce, which we thought were superior to the traditional version with more depth in flavour.  

Decor - cozy, intimate

Service - knowledgeable and attentive

Menu -- short and focused, all small plates are priced the same, so are the large plates.

Enjoy!
