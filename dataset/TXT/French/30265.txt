FRuuIDOd21pTJHvEGIt1Gg Excellent service and excellent food even at the end of the day. They serve food and drinks right up until closing which is very convenient. The steak tartare was excellent and the pappardelle was very rich and tasty ( a little too decadent but very good). I ended the night with the lemon cream and mascarpone mousse, which was the highlight for me. This was one of the best desserts I've had. Have it with a side of honey and tea.
