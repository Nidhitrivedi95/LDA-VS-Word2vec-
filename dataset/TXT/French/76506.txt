Yp9w4nhUowBU_IS_StFXbQ We had breakfast at 3pm, and this was probably the best late late brunch I have had. 
The drinks were perfect, the traditional Eggs Benedict was amazing. Lots of meat, and a great hollandaise sauce that's oozing with goodness. 

As with all places Wynn, a bit on the expensive side. But you also pay for the luxury to never leave your resort, and be confident you are not missing much outside by roaming the strip for food. That's an oxymoron in and of itself. 

Our service was awesome, the waitstaff was amazing and looked happy to be there for us on Christmas Day!
