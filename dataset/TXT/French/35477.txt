htQgj-ANQpZGpIpkkrEmyQ Where did this place come from? Nestled in quaint Markham main street this Asian fusion place has a feel that belongs downtown. A limited menu but all  big on taste. I had the far east burger and duck frit fries. Delicious. Haven't tasted this fusion flavor outside of a trip downtown. Fairly priced and convenient for those in the suburbs I will definitely come back.
