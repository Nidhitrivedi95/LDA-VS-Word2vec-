ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug We were walking around the Paris hotel and thought we would stop by for dinner here. They had a special for the day with a nice 3 course meal for $39.

I had the french onion soup and it was really good. I got the mixed meats course where I ordered the mashed potatoes which was decent but could tell it was microwaved but the mushrooms dish with 5 different mushrooms which was pretty good. My meal also included two small lamb chops, a spicy italian sausage, and a petite mignon. The lamb was decent, sausage was dry, and the cook could not get the filet mignon right. I ordered it medium (pink and juicy). The first time it came out charred and over cooked and the second time, after I had sent it back it came rare and soft. The sausage looked like it was on a hot flame but the inside was dry and one end was cool to cold. For dessert the cheese cake came in and it was yellow and buttery, with not much cheese. We agreed it was like eating a sweet and salty stick of butter. My GF had the fish dish, I think it was salmon and she said it was OK but nothing special.

They were nice enough to try to make my meal right but ended up just getting filled up on the lamb and mushrooms. 

Overall, the service was outstanding and a floor supervisor even noticed I hadn't eaten much of the beef and asked if I would want a drink on the house. I kindly declined.  I imagine the kitchen had a hot flame and try to make the cook time faster but if they would use just a tad lower flame and a couple minutes longer to grill things the food would have probably been very good. We'll probably stop by for the french onion soup again next time, nice service but the food can use just a little work, the restaurant has potential.
