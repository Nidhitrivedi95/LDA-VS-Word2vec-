O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q I'm sure this has been covered extensively in other reviews, but interesting choice of artwork they have going on here. Keeps you occupied for a good handful of minutes while tilting your head and wondering whose which what body parts are depicted. We came for a birthday brunch and I was pretty happy with my king crab eggs benedict. The oysters were fine as well. The biggest complaint was the bloody mary; apparently the "non spicy" ones were still too spicy to chug down for most of the group. Overall, it's a decent brunch spot, especially if your group is staying at the Venetian or Palazzo and are far too hungover to crawl very far. They also made the birthday girl give a giddy shriek with a really cute sparkler candle on top of a delicious creme brulee, so they get some bonus points there!
