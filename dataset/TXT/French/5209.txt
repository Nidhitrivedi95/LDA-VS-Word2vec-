3FlWR_osNPb8dcqLgHebHw Mimi's Cafe Summerlin: slow and inefficient service on Saturday May 7, 2016. Server Candace Candy 
failed to bring our bread basket and meatball appetizer until end of meal. Never offered her apologies for her delayed service nor was the appetizer removed from the bill. Shame on you Mimi's Cafe Summerlin! Negative zero stars! Our family has been coming here for 10 years and lately the service and staff have just been disgusting!
