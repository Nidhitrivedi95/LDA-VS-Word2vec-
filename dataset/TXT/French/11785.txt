4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Mon Ami Gabi was the last restaurant we visited before heading to the airport to make our way home. I'm glad we stopped because it's hard to find a place back home that serves traditional French fare, such as the Croque Madame. That's what I ordered, and I don't have a regret whatsoever. My only complaint about the food is that the pomme frites (fries) arrived cold. My SO had a savory crepe, and it was average. But I don't believe crepes should ever be savory to begin with. 

Seating was uncomfortably close, with our neighboring table only a mere few inches away. It felt as though I was a part of their entire conversation, as that was the only thing I could hear during my meal. The service was slow, and it wasn't even busy. Our waitress could have cared less about our patronage. I mean, it is a restaurant on the Strip, but geez... I probably won't return on any future trips back to Vegas, unless I'm really craving French food, and there's literally nowhere else. 

Overall: 2.5/5
