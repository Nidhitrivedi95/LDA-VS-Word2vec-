I think I'd been here years ago for drinks at night, but this was my first time brunching at Sparrow. A savoury brunch for two. This is a charming yuppie brunch - everything is pleasant and rustically refined with pops of whimsy. 

A nice reminder of some past summer travels, I opted for the turkish breakfast: olives, feta, eggs, walnuts, apricots, veggies, flatbread, sour cherry jam, fig jam and merguez sausage on the side. Visually appealing and good for people who like to pick on a little of this and bit of that. Nothing too standout in terms of taste. It makes a great photograph for all you IG/Yelp types!

Likely to appease me (I had mentioned that this dish looked great), my fellow bruncher got a near perfect savoury dish with hints of sweetness that consisted of house smoked trout with spinach and green onion pancake, beet salad, soft boiled egg and whipped creme fraiche. I preferred this dish and we shared both plates. 

I wouldn't wait in line for this (and thankfully we didn't) but I would recommend it if you're looking for a solid brunch spot in the mile end.

This is a bar and so definitely order some boozy brunch cocktails while you're at it!
