cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg Good, but not great foie gras (great foie gras does not need to be drowned in a  balsamic or any other glaze!). The duck in a can works and the foie packed with it works better there too; the pot of assorted meats got good marks as well. An Italiante eggplant and pasta starter didn't work and shouldn't have been served, and the beef tongue was good without being particularly distinguished for those who grew-up with and enjoy tongue. We understand that the deafening noise level is part of the experience--although we don't appreciate it, but the real let-down was the service, or lack thereof. Despite having an early reservation and ordering without delay, staff kept wandering by without either noticing or at least responding to empty glasses (yes, we did want to order another round!). Oh, and to the server who promised to wrap-up the last of the meat pot to go--yes, we finally gave up and went; not planning to return.
