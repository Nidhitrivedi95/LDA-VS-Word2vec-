cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg My bf and myself are big fan of Anthony Bourdain's No Reservations follower. After watching the Montreal episode of No Reservations, we decide to drive up to Au pied de cochon from NYC. It was very very hard to get table reservation, so we decide to walk in see if we can get lucky. And...YES! we are very lucky to show up 5pm hungry for some good food and there boom 2 bar seat available, of course no question we took the spot and start drinking while we check out the menu...Yes, the duck in the can is fun, the menu descriptions and dish names are playful. This is serious food and seriously amazing, and fun. Things not to miss include the foie gras tart, the boidin noir, and baked apple. The PDC mashed potatoes are half potato, half cheese, and that is a beautiful thing. The draft cider is also quite refreshing, and the wine list is relaxed and affordable.  Bon Appetit!!
