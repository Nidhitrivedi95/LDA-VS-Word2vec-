w2tr0PA0b3tg8pId0kjM-A Walking into Gaby et Jules I was immediately captivated by the pastries. They looked absolutely beautiful. All of the different shapes, colors and textures. Not only was there a variety, but each one looks absolutely perfect. I had to stop wondering how it was possible to make these and start figuring out which one I wanted to eat, otherwise I might have stood there all day. I was a little intimidated by the descriptions. I wish I had brushed up on my French and maybe brought along a dictionary of pastry terms. After reading all of the cards, I realized, how can I go wrong as long as it looks like chocolate and doesn't have something I don't like as an ingredient. 
I finally chose 2. One was a long rectangle covered in glistening chocolate. Inside was a delicate cake surrounded by mousse with just a hint of a crunch.
The second was cylinder of chocolate mousse with a Carmel filling. They were Bo the kind of food you ate with very small bites, savoring each morsel and trying to identify all of the shuttle favors and textures.
