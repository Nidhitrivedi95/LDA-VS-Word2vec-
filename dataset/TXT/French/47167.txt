O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q What a great place with a great large bistro feel. The staff was very competent and responsive. The food was very good. We were impressed with the variety on the menu and fusion of other cultures... loved the Bloody Mary cart that your server brings to your table! Try a BM with tequila for a cool twist! I actually wanted the quiche which my wife had gotten before and raved about (so creamy and light) and instead opted for the chicken and waffles?!? I know at a bistro! But it was great. Love this place. The outdoor seating can be in the sun so avoid midday heat and eat inside or late evening meals.
