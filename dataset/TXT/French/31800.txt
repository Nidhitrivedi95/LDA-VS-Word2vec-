GS06uO84yKQpa7oezgVZgQ Went to Cafe St Honore as part of the Dine around 2009 promotion. This offers 2 courses for £15. As ever we went at lunchtime & the saving was not massive as they do offer a lunchtime menu at a reasonable cost. The ambiance was lovely, the staff were friendly & welcoming & the tables beautifully set. We has a choice of 2 or3 items for each course. I started with the soup of the day whichwas mushroom. It was delicious. Hubby had the smoked trout salad which looked fantastic too. At this point in time I should point out that all of the ingredients are locally sourced, or as many as possible. The quality is outstanding. My only disappointment was the risotto, I don't think it was made with proper risotto rice & the texture was just not quite right. Also being made with smoked haddock it was a bit too salty. I should on reflection have chosen something different as I always have this dish when I go to Skippers & in my eyes it can't be beaten.
That said we had a lovely meal & the bill was as we expected. Well worth seeking out if your in the area. Booknig recommended!
