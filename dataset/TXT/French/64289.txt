tCSlpwJQ4CZsUEMZeH2SFg Step one foot into this Parisian Bistro, smell the coffee, see the people, fall in love! If you've never been to France, the decor, music, and food will take you there. Right here in Charlotte!!! I finally made it to Cafe Monte one Sunday for Brunch and the place was full of people!!! I was alive when I walked in. Really reminded me of a Bistro in Paris. I waited for close to an hour for my table, which is reasonable on a busy Sunday afternoon with no reservation. After being seated, my only complaint was that I wasn't getting good natural lighting for food pictures lol! I had coffee to start, the Cafe Au Lait (I think). Wasn't all that thrilling. Anyway, I ordered the Waffle with flambeed bananas, bacon, and of course frites! Everything was good. The bacon (which I call a gateway meat seeing that I don't eat pork) was marvelous! My guest had the quiche. She thought it was a little overcooked. Our waitor wasn't the most attentive, but other than that, we really enjoyed this place. Hope to get back soon!
