jSfnItqaOnEp2nenVF7fCg I can't believe it's taken me this long to try this place. What was I thinking?!!' I've been missing out! I had the quiche Lorraine which was excellent, my boyfriend had the Cuban panini which was sooo yummy. They also had a corn green chile soup that was to die for. Everything was amazing, a true little gem in surprise for sure! Can't wait to go back
