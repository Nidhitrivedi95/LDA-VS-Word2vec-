b3wgQ6CccBO8fgvlbS0M1Q I have been looking for a cute French cafe for a while and stumbled into Au Petit Four by accident. It is my new favorite French place in Phoenix. The people working there were French, were speaking French, and had French music playing. The doors were open and the air was chilly and it almost felt like I was in France. 
I had a croissant for a snack with an espresso, then tried the spinach quiche and a pastry. It wasn't cheap, but it is located in the Biltmore, so no surprise. I'm very impressed and can't wait to go back.
