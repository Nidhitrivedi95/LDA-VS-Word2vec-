E9HkUYYO_-5vKjvBwLuDIw Came here for dinner with a friend. The service was excellent and our waitress was very attentive. The bread was crispy and the butter was very creamy. We got the Le France charcuterie plate (the only weak link here was the Parisian ham, which to me isn't really charcuterie...) ($15), the pistachio goat cheese appetizer ($9), the French onion soup ($6.50), the endive salad ($10) and the Moules Poulette ($19). We also got a free tiramisu for checking in on Yelp. Overall, everything was very reasonably priced. The flavors were excellent. Everything was very well-prepared. They even kindly split the endive salad onto two plates for us. Highly recommend!
