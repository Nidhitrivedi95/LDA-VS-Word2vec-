XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q We waited 45 minutes before we were served any bread. The service is extremely slow for only having a few guests in the restaurant. We arrived at 5:30pm and didn't get the amuse buse for over an hour. We did the 4 course meal. The foie with artichoke and the lobster appetizers were delicious. Everything else was downhill. The cheese souffle was mush. It had a decent flavor but texture was awful. After having the corn amuse buse, it just didn't pair well. My husband had the ribeye which was 2 slices of meat. For that price it should be a whole steak. I had the pork. It was too spicy with pepper. The black pepper was huge chunks that completely blew out my palate. We both ordered the chocolate souffle for dessert. Mine was undercooked. Certain items on the menu if ordered were an added charge. After already paying $400 for a meal, not including tip, everything on the menu should be included. I wish I could be refunded. This was not the experience I was expecting.
