VzLwewoXSFVLUQjHgBzlzA EXCELLENT food. We had Black Angus steak, lamb risotto, duck (which was superb), and guinea fowl. Appetizer of the day was also delicious (a dumpling/ravioli with spinach and ricotta). Only complaint was the noise. The space is small and intimate, so if there's a large group eating while you dine, it may be loud. Not a place to go if you are sensitive to noise or want a quiet dinner.
