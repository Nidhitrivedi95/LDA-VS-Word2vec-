hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA This place is amazing...like everyone else, the host Olivier is awesome. He welcomes you with hospitality and continues until you leave. I think he makes an effort to remember your face and name.. he immediately asked me if it was my first time and called others by their first name.
The place was a bit hard to find (Google maps was not accurrate). If you find yourself staring at a business building, just drive around to the back and you'll see it. 
They use Illy, so that was a plus for me to come here, but learning that all their items are "fresh" made and he is making a goal towards all organic and fresh (not frozen).
