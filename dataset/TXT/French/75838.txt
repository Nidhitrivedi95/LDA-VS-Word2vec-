YMcGgFQDEarRQ22ml1z_VQ We were shopping for a bag across the street, but I had eyed up Milo et Fine before we had even stepped into the store as a potential spot for a coffee afterwards.  It looked cute and welcoming on the outside with a tractor painted on the window front, which definitely drew in my 2 year old son.  We were warmly welcomed and ordered 3 hot drinks and a little Breton cake.  All were delicious and served in carefully selected, sweet, vintage dishes.  Their saucers even matched one I use at home to hold a bar of soap!  I loved the Breton-inspired nautical decorations and the clean modern feel to the café but with lovely vintage touches.  It was the perfect spot for an afternoon cup.  I noticed that they used beans from a St Henri roasting company.  I am always a fan of local cafés using local beans and other products. I am loving all the shops and cafés opening up on Beaubien.  I wished I lived a little closer!
