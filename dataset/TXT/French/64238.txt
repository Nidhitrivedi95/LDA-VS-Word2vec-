tCSlpwJQ4CZsUEMZeH2SFg The atmosphere was great during Sunday brunch, good mix of people(After church crowd, older, younger, those recovering from Saturday night, etc..) decor was very much French bistro, outdoor seating and forced to walk by the pastries and goodies as your seated inside. The service was lacking.. I will echo the not refilling cups of coffee trend the other reviewers mentioned. The classic eggs Benedict were great and the hollandaise was perfect. The ham and egg croissant was very uninspiring and was served alone on a plate, some fruit or salad would have been nice. Will return to try their fries and onion soup.... to see if that influences my rating.... until then...
