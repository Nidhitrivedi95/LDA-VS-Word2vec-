bzbNGyrTwWHAgg1CqkSgeg I have been a few times, but haven't gotten around to writing my review. Can we say SHRIMP & GRITS? One of their most popular dishes is the red velvet waffles and chicken-also equally good. Each time I have went, there was a wait unless you opt to sit at the bar. You will have to see them prepare all the food through the window to the kitchen, which for me takes the fun out of it, but it definitely doesn't take away from the taste. Get there early to avoid a line but GO!
