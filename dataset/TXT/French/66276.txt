uP3H5bcsiTXM0k0xQhRndg My husband and I took our two year old here our first night in Montreal. We were seated upstairs in a small loft area. No high chairs, so beware! The restaurant locally sources their foods and is a family run business, so the menu is one page. We had the mac and cheese and the pork belly along with the local stout. We also had the pistachio creme brulee and the chocolate cake. Everything was delicious! Our picky son ate the some cheese and bread. The service was A+ though. Everyone was really understanding about our tired kid!
