5EIuCcoHY2evAhFMBV6G6g LOST: SOUL AND GOOD SERVICE; IF FOUND PLEASE RETURN TO PINOT

The food was actually pretty good overall, with a generous portion of moules mariniere soaking in a hot tub of butter, wine and garlic, and a Flintstones-sized short rib that was fall-off-the-bone tender.  The only negatives were the duck breast which was tough and chewy, the service which was painfully intermittent especially given how empty the restaurant was, and the utter lack of soul and character.  If I'm dropping a few bills on dinner, I expect something more than just good food.
