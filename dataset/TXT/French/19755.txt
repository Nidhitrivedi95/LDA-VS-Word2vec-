aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw so ive been seeing this fad in the culinary world about these darn macaroons...my bf and i decided on stay in vegas to find some to try and i heard bouchon bakery had great ones.

thank goodness i decided on this bakery to try my first macroons here...i tried the chocolate, pastachio, and caramel flavors. they are a bit pricey but worth it! the employee there gave me a coffee one when i originally asked for the caramel and before i left i made sure they gave me the correct one but of course they gave me the wrong one...so i told her i asked for the caramel not coffee...she gave me a look and gave me the caramel..never said sorry or anything. boo on customer service there. but on my last day of vacation in vegas...i couldnt resist to take some home....love the caramel one out of all them..and customer servicewas def improved bc it wasnt the same girl haha.

you should def come here for great macaroons!
