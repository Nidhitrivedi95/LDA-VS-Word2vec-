50-xiTYmE6NERi-yJ6NvHw Nice restaurant, servers that are helpful and willing to explain parts of the menu. I had Braise Beef Cheek & Bone Marrow, and Beef Bourghuignon. The plate presentation were nice, only overdone by the excellent taste and tenderness of the beef. My bride had Asparagus Soup, Sockeye Salmon. Both were flavorful. First time her but it will not be the last. We enjoyed the food very much.  Server was good. Thank you for the meal.
