xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g It's more like a 3.5 stars for me.

The bad: the place is extremely noisy and touristy. A giant number of people waiting to get seated on a non-weekend night. The deco is old and dingy. This is definitely not a "fine" Michellin-star dining experience. 

The good: the view is quite good. You got a panorama view of the Bellagio fountains, though if you really want to see the fountain, Le Cirque and Picasso in Bellagio would have better views. 

The unexpected: for such a touristy place, the food is actually quite decent. The bread is fresh and tasty; the drinks are well-made while not exceptional; my entree (cod) is tasty as well... typical good French cooking.

Overall I will not go back because it was so touristy. Le Cirque and Picasso are much better (also more expensive). I can see it being fun for some one who wanna go to a destination restaurant while having decent food.
