bgzMrz4qzEfJ7qqNthcveA Been there twice. Once as they just opened, second time a month or two ago.
Was never disappointed.
Still on a top list of the meals I've had in Toronto.
Menu changes every day, and even though it's considered French, I would classify it as French-Moroccan fusion, with Middle Eastern influence.
The food is inventive, tastes amazing and the service is always impeccable. 
It's not cheap, but I am very willing to pay for an excellent food and service.
I've noticed a lot of reviews pointing their portion sizes. Honestly, I didn't find them small. Last time we shared an appetizer, got two mains and two sides, as we wanted to try everything. We honestly had no space left for dessert.
Bottom line - it's a restaurant which puts a lot of efforts and passion into their work. And they are doing really well.
You want big portions for nothing - go to McDonalds across the road. Period.
