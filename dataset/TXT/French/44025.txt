MdjIl105vqCYUGKFSUVytA Colette is very well decorated with a great ambiance. Their service was amazing when it came to the support staff who were clearing the plates, and filling up water glasses. But the actual server himself seemed uninterested near the end of our meal. In the beginning he was on point with our coffee and mimosas, but it took at least 30 minutes until we could wave him down for our cheque. 

The food was okay. I didn't feel blown away or overly impressed. The options were very interesting and they seem to have put some thought into it. But the actually execution was lacking. Not one thing I tasted left any impression. 

At the end of everything with tax and tip I walked away spending $90 for myself. This included the buffet, a coffee, and a mimosa. That is ridiculous! The food was not worth the price I paid. This is definitely a spot for people with cash to burn and care more about their status than the quality that they're paying for. 

If you have that much money and looking for something good to eat, go one block East and check out Le Select Bistro.
