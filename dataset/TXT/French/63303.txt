Out of Zack Bruell's restaurants that I've tried (Table 45, Chinato), this is the better of the 3. At least it wasn't too salty and at least it was flavorful?

We were seated right away. It's a nice artsy type of restaurant- the lights were dimmed and the restaurant seemed pretty spacious.

I got the "Pork Two Ways." My friend claimed that the chicken confit was to die for. It seemed good? Let's just say one thing- the portions are HUGE. Yes, HUGE. I have no idea how people actually finish their dishes. 

I did enjoy that they came out on stone pots/plates. I do enjoy food which is cooked in stone pots. My pork in two ways was, yes, gigantic- the pork "shank" per se, was alright- tender, flavorful, soft. The pork belly... just seemed overcooked. I'm not sure- I just didnt' really enjoy it. My friends, however, loved their foods.

This place didn't really meet my expectations. Food was alright- but for a place so hyped out, it was okay. I kind of wish the tables just weren't so close to each other though. The waitress brought over a plate of cheeses for another table next to us...and man, it reeked!

Next time, I'll try something different. All I know is that no pork dish for me next time....
