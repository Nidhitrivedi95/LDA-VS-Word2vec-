-unEKbRspO6OuEaPdmRywg Underwhelming. 

Went with a group of 8, place was empty aside from a large group (30+). 

Ambiance: 4-stars, classy. 

Menu: limited selection, meat heavy and lacks any sophistication. 

Food: onion soup tasted bland (colored water), goat cheese beet salad had no goat cheese, etc. Filet was good but consisted of a chunk of meet with no sides. Salmon was a ridiculously small, overcooked piece. 1 star. 

Drinks: great wine selection, decent cocktail list. 3-stars

Service: attentive, but sommelier kept skipping the two ladies at the table, which was rude (and you should always start with the ladies...) 2-stars.
