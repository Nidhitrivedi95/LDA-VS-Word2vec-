Maybe it was because we went at 2PM but the brioche we bought were all dry and stale tasting (yet somehow there was a lot of oil stains in the box within the 5min walk back to our hotel room). I had the exotic while the BF had the Nutella. The exotic had large chunks of fruit which were a little hard to eat (they should probably cut into smaller pieces). I wasn't much a fan. The BF's Nutella look burnt and tasted dry w/ very little Nutella. BF took one bite of the PB&J (the only brioche not warmed up) and threw the rest away.

Definitely not recommended.
