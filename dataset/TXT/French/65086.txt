TLf-aHjmcG_4QB5-k6s6lQ Aweful, service was so long, we were 2 and the resto wasnt full, i got my plate and my egg was cold!!
My husband wasnt getting his plate cuz they forgot to order it.
I hated my experience i do not recommend it to anybody AND its pretty pricey for breakfast. The plates are not generous.
Good luck to the owner
