OkC86YtZ0Nm19my5F4GGrQ Adorable dimly lit restaurant! The food is incredible. Highly recommend the Brie cheese appetizer baked in a pastry crust. The French onion soup was perfect and full of thick bread, onions, and cheese. Got the beef tartine which was loaded with meat cheese and horseradish on thin baguette. Super carb heavy meal but totally worth it!
