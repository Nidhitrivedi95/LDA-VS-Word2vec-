rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w A wonderful restaurant.  Great food.  Outstanding service.

My wife had the snails, which she loved and I started with a special truffled risotto, which was superb.  For the mains, my wife had the waygu rib-eye, which was wonderful and I had the butter-poached lobster which was amazing.  Note that rib-eye arrives pre-sliced, which was a bit of a surprise and may have made it a bit less juicy than expected.  Nevertheless, wonderful.

We closed it out with two wonderful grand mariner souffles.  For the wine, we had a Nuits Saint Georges, suggested by the sommelier Frederic, who was wonderful as well.

Topping off the great service was the wonderful interior, which is really beautiful.
