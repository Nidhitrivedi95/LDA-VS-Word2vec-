XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q Wanted to eat at the Robuchon outpost in Las Vegas for quite a while...  I was not disappointed.  The bar occupys up to about 40 guests with well informed servers presenting your food to the guest over the counter.  It becomes obvious that you are at a Robuchon's vision of being a japanese  style counter chef.  But with Robuchon's stern eye in the room,  his food is complete in all forms but none.

The crispy thin tart of sweet onion and pancetta was offered with a couple of perfectly cooked quail eggs that burst with the mellow yellow yolk.  It was so delicious and it was garnished with a nice pairing of sorrel greens.  He had the fancy stuff too.  Such as the quail egg stuffed with foie gras and served with truffle potatoe puree.  Man it was good.  Very small and expensive... but it was worth it.  I think.
One dish stood out above the rest and that was the steak tar tar... Basically a raw burger patty with the fixings ... dijon. onions. pickles.  s&p... Served with french fries and a tiny little wedge of iceburg lettuce, I really began to think I was eating a burger and fries.  

The presentation is very precise and the line cooks take there time to get things right on the plates.  They move fast but take their time on the plates.  A sign of a good experience to come.  

But it just so happened that he was there that weekend and I got to meet the icon... practically a god to most people.  He is the inventor of new cusine almost.  But more then all of that, he is just a great chef.  I found he was a very nice man and up next  is hopefully the Mansion next door.  When I asked him how it was... he just smiled looked at me and nodded his head up and down with a silly little smile on his face and I trusted his every nod.
