Since Manon (a nearby French bakery) keeps disappointing me, I am so HAPPY that I finally found a cute quaint little French Cafe to stop in and have a pastry and coffee.  I can't wait to try the lunch menu.

I love that it has outdoor seating with umbrellas.

They play French Music so you feel like you're sitting in a French cafe in Paris.

French Press Coffee here, with a FP carafe brought out to your table!

When I ordered my coffee with croissant the menu had the item posted as, "bread/croissant" so I asked her, "Is it just a croissant that comes with the order?" and she said, "Yes". So I get my order and a huge baguette was there too?  Had I known, I would have just ordered a small chocolate croissant...oh well.  She needs a little training and to crack a wee bit of a smile too. I won't knock any stars off for that because the other servers were friendly and I loved everything else about the cafe.  

Plus...I got a 10 percent off with my Yelp Check-In.

Despite it's location in a strip mall, it's off on it's own, so you don't have distractions of other businesses or heavy traffic.  

The case of goodies isn't as expansive as Manon but they offered Macarons and chocolate croissants as well as other savory treats.

Nice lunch menu too serving up traditional items like grilled Croque Madame, Soups, Quiche, etc.

Great little cafe for a nice breakfast don't miss it.
