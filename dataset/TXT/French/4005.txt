This is a perfect example of not being able to tell a book by its cover.  This is a place you go to because you're looking for it, not because you passed a sign that says "French Crêpes".  And you should go looking for it.  Their crêpes are great, and very authentic, not only because they use different flour for the galettes (savory crêpes) and dessert crêpes, but because it's organic, and actually imported from France.  The crêpes (the pancake part) have a delicate flavor, with a nice bit of sponginess.  The fillings are fresh and flavorful.  There is also a nice selection of fresh-made fruit and vegetable juices.  Their coffee drinks are also great.  The accent is on fresh fare that leaves you satisfied, but not overstuffed. Decorations are pleasant, without being overwhelming, and Maggie is warm and friendly.  The fact that French natives love to eat here tells you a lot about the quality and authenticity of the offerings at La Maison de Maggie.
