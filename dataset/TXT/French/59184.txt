rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w This is the most expensive restaurant I've been to so far and I am not really sure if I am expecting too much or too little....my ideal rating for this place would be 3 1/2 stars but I'll round up because they had some "surprise elements" (more on this on the bottom) that I wasn't expecting and it was a good touch.

- 1 star for the super slow and unattentive service that almost made us miss our 9:30pm show and we started eating at 6:30! I had to flag them down so many times. I had even told them I had a 9:30 show in the beginning and the waiter assured us that we will make it.

All dishes but 1 was perfect for us (this is what i had wanted to take off the 1/2 star for). My fiancee had ordered escargot for appetizers and it was SO buttery and salty. You couldn't taste much aside from the butter. The portion was generous...but he couldn't finish eating it because it was so salty and buttery.

Everything else was perfectly delightful but the highlights - 
Lobster Salad Black Truffle Dressing - Generous portions of lobster, flavorful but light dressing, delicious and so beautifully presented. 

Beef Tenderloin, Sautéed Foie Gras, Smoked Serrano Potato Croquette, Sweet Onion Compote Supp. - The foie gras was perfectly cooked with a thin crunchy layer and a very generous portion. A very good "first time" with foie gras. My steak is cooked to a perfect medium rare....drooling as I speak...

Napoleon of Melon, Chilled Midori Melon Soup - This is incredibly refreshing! I loved the cantaloupe sorbet atop watermelon. It was both visually pleasing and awesome way to finish up dinner. 

The "surprise elements" that I mentioned earlier were that we got to do some sampling of some of the chef's new dishes and got a tray of Petite Fours after our dessert and finally a darling little jewelry box with 2 drawers- containing one delicious chocolate truffle in each drawer. A perfect way to end a dinner...if you didn't have to catch a show.
