_eNeiqWPt1MPLFF6DEIJeA A new spot in Lakewood that has been open a couple months.  Didn't go in for food, however my drink and experience left a superb impression on me and I will be going back to try their Ramen, deconstructed sushi, and Chicken & Waffles.  If you are looking for a refreshing, delicious, beautiful (and strong) cocktail, please order the Cucumber Lime Gin Fizz-One of the better Gin Fizzes I've had in my life. Also, order a sake bomb so you can check out the cool presentation.
