SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA Excellent service with absolutely professional and friendly staff who managed to introduce special dishes of the day and give recommendations artfully. I'd highly recommend the Cassoulet and Foie Gras. The best thing about this place arguably would be their sun-filled patio, which would be perfect for a dinner in the summer.
