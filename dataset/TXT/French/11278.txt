4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw All you need to order is the French Onion soup and the Filet Mignon.  Period.  This was my favorite place we ate at on my trip and we even went back.  We sat on the patio and you can watch the water show at the Bellagio from there.  The filet was so tender you could cut it with a fork and it will melt in your mouth.  They cover with some sort of wine/butter sauce which then gets soaked up by the potatoes.  SCORE!  The French Onion soup is the best I've had.  And I know my FO soup.  If you are in Vegas this is a MUST TRY!  I also had the Pepper Crusted Seared Ahi Tuna Salad with was pretty good, but the filet is the main attraction!
