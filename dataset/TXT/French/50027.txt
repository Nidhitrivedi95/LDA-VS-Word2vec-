I stopped in to the shop for a hangover breakfast of sorts. I had a simple le Parisien (French baguette with butter, ham, and Swiss cheese) - and it hit the spot! The baguette was among the best I've ever had; and, the ham, cheese, and butter were perfectly proportioned - fresh, tasty combo of great flavors. I can't wait to go back and sample some pastries!
