ohMpNug5zWNxOlL6ShG7Ig As a man of few written words, I have to say I love this place and I would go back in a heartbeat.  Great food, nice wine list, small place with a cozy atmosphere.  A little too big of a push on the fries, but you'll love the mussels, the country pate and the trout was amazing.  Enjoy.
