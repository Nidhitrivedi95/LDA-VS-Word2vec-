bzbNGyrTwWHAgg1CqkSgeg I've always had a great experience when I go to Terrace. It's one of my all time favor brunch spots! I love their red velvet waffle and chicken!! I get it just about every time I go for brunch. I've also had a breakfast drink...kinda a spin on the mimosa....there but I can't remember the name of it. It has grenadine and pineapple juice though and it's delicious! I've had their fried green tomatoes and they were very tasty as well. Honestly, I've never had anything that I didn't like at Terrace.
