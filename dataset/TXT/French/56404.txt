rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Started off good, but ended on a disappointing note. Sat at a bar table, took a while to be greeted. Ordered a 3 cheese tasting plate which was delicious. For entrees had the croque madame and the steak frites. Croque madame was good, but seemed as though it had been sitting under a heat lamp for a little too long. Steak frites was a nice cut of meat and cooked well, but was extremely onion-y. Even the frites were taking on an onion flavor. Our server checked on our appetizer, but did not come back to our table for refills or to check on our food until we asked one of the bussers to have him bring our check. When we left, we let the manager know about our experience and he didn't seem to care much. Started out well, but for a $100+ meal, was disappointing.
