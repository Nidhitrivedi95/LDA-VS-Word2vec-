ZrHU8ZzwZQjTRpB1K_8JTQ My wife, son, and I really enjoyed our visit. My son had the Stamm Burger and really enjoyed it. My wife had the Walleye and loved it. I had the perch. I like my perch without any taste of oil to the batter and this had a very slightly oily batter; but I enjoyed it none-the-less. The building has been restored to an amazing beauty. The service was excellent. My wife and I do not drink alcohol and the bartender put a lot of effort into producing an excellent N.A. Old Fashioned and N.A. Mojito for my wife and me. The manager/owner stopped by twice to touch base. All-in-all, very well done. Applause, applause Stamm House! Thank you!
