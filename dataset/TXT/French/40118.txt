KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA Disappointed. Have been coming here for years.
Decided to celebrate a personal achievement. The server was at 50%. No personality. Never even asked how our meal was. Risotto was ok, husbands meal was ok.
Best part was the free music. Way to go Hal !
Really sad. As this was one of my favorite places.
