3jKUbhGSjFTv5jZ0wnW0xA On a warm early autumn night, returning to this city that I love many years ago as a student, my daughter and I really enjoyed this modest little gem.  

We ordered from the table d'hote and loved every course.  My salmon tartar was generous and perfectly seasoned.  My beef tenderloin was perfectly cooked and deliciously succulent.  My daughter's fish entre was a bit overdone for my tastes but the preparation was well balanced and perfectly seasoned.  The wines were reasonably priced, and the service was attentive and friendly in spite of the fact that I've forgotten almost al the French I ever knew and had to rely exclusively on English.

As a tourist I only ate here once, and I can't compare it with other Montreal restaurants, but from my limited point of view, this place was everyting I was looking for and helped rekindle my love of Montreal.  Highly recommended.
