4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw On my last trip to Vegas I made it a point to try Mon Ami Gabi. I heard really stellar reviews on this place and I love me some French food!
I dined for brunch enjoyed the escargot and the baked brie. Their Nicoise salad was a generous portion. I also inhaled the baguette they served at the beginning of the meal. The prices here are pretty steep (with drinks about $65pp) and that was just for brunch. It is totally worth it though and I left a happy camper. Next time I am in Vegas I will definitely try to go back again.
