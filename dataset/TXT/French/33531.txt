hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA I like this place. The owner was really attentive to the customers and you can tell the food is made with quality ingredients. 

My bestfriend and I came in for breakfast. She had a croissant with scrambled egg and mushrooms. I had a pesto baguette. I didn't want meat or eggplant so the owner suggested mushrooms. I thought that was really thoughtful of him to be okay with the substitution. We also had the chocolate tart.

We found everything to be good and tasty. We did, however, find the chocolate tart a bit too tasty (but that wasn't bad or anything; just we couldn't eat it all in one go). 

Price wise... It wasn't cheap but also not overly expensive. I thought it was priced pretty decently. Our total with tax was around $19 dollars. We were both full, after.
