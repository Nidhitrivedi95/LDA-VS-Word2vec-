Loved it. Amazing service, despite how packed and booked this place was. They found 2 tables for us outside and our waiter was the best. He was cute, knew his beer, and made great suggestions and convo.

My Blue Cheese, Apple & Endive Salad was worth every 10 of my $10. Its large, so much flavor, and pretty! The Foie Gras Cromesquis i could live without, not my cup of tea--i tried it well because...when in rome.. i mean when in montreal. My friend loved her poutine fries, deff worth every penny of hers. Also, they have a great stout collection here, over all we were pleased.
