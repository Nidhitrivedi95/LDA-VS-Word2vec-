4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw i'd rate this as a "high" 3.5 star which rounds the rating up to 4.

me, the wife and the in-laws had a nice dinner here.  i started with an smash of an onion soup that was fully of cheesy goodness.  the wife and the pop-in-law split a salade maison, which was a mixed green salad w/ a house vinagrette and a goat cheese crouton.  they enjoyed it but nothing special for them.  mom-in-law just had sat tight for her entree.  

i had the skate, as my entree, which was very tasty but oh so buttery, a bit too much i would say.  the wife had the lemon chicken w/ french cut beans which she found flavorful but a bit overcooked.  pop-in-paw had the thyme-seared salmon which was quite good and mom-in-law had the sampler of vegetables which looked excellent and i tried some beets and was won over.

we all split the chocolate mousse for dessert and loved it.  it was a bit thick but they added lil pellets of crunchy chocolate thingies (cue homer) and that just made it!  this itself makes the place a 4 star!

the service was good though a bit on the slow side.  our waitress was quite nice to us and very funny too.  she suggested a great pinot noir but i completely forget the name of it but it's the only pinot noir on their wine by the glass list.
