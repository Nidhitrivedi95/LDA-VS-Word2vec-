Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA MIX is a gorgeous restaurant, and if you're lucky enough to sit outside the view is amazing. The food is pretty good, but you're paying more for the overall experience and ambiance. 

I thought the ahi tartare was just okay. I would have preferred ahi and avocado instead of the cucumber with curry flavoring. 

The lobster curry was good but not amazing. The pieces of lobster were large, but the curry sauce and the rice were not too impressive.  Personally, I don't think the two go together.

The filet with foie gras and black truffle was yummy! Too bad my first steak was way overcooked.  They were nice enough to take it back and prepare another one for me, and they even gave me a new side of potatoes which I thought was a nice gesture.  The 2nd one was cooked perfectly, but I felt like half the piece was really good and tender and the other half had a lot of gristle and was a little tough to eat. Guess I had bad luck with the piece I got. =\

The sorbet was a nice way to end the meal.  Overall, MIX is still one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas. The service was good and the decor and view are very impressive.
