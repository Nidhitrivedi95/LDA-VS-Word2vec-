KjuvzMveMCyUqbQy3dBuBA This restaurant is by far the worst I've came across in Markham. The price is just ridiculous, the food was whatever. The steak and lobster TAIL combo... Ugh I don't even want to look at it. The lobster tail was there but the meat was not attached to the tail and it was a few random lobster pieces! How do I know this? Because I'm a manager of a Chinese seafood restaurant and right away I can see that the lobster chunks came from different parts of the lobster. The chicken leg that I got tasted like rubber and the gravy? Tasted like package powder gravy. Honestly this is not the place you want to go if you want to have steak or lobster. The service was okay and that's why I'm giving it 1 star besides that I don't fine anything nice
