gjCmXkMNVE0JSk8puUwv6g Two of us met to share dishes at this new healthy eating restaurant.  Leaving the restaurant thinking about how good the desserts were compared to the savory dishes is not the best way to remember a meal.

The savory dishes for the most part were lacking in seasoning.  The presentation is exceptionally good looking and make the food something you want to dig into.  When we got to the chicken, we both mentioned about it needing something even just plain salt.  It wasn't until later that I saw on a table where the artificial sweeteners were, there were also salt and pepper grinders.  Too late.  The chicken and later the angus beef were lacking in seasoning.

Moving past the savory dishes and moving to dessert showed where Eatt shines at the present time.  A favorite of mine was the tiramisu prepared and presented in quite a different manner.  The poached peach with a nougat center and sprinkled with some pistachio pieces and the praline puffs were very well executed and were quite good.

The restaurant has a lot of promise.  The chefs are trying different things and the plating is very successful.  The savories need work with seasoning. 

The place is very bright and pleasant.  There are a lot of window space that gives the place a nice, lighted interior.
