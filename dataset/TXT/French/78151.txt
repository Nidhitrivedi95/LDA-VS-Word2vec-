YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g Best meal we have had in years. Beautiful dining room and excellent service. 

To begin they served us complimentary Moscato D'Asti which is an Italian Dessert wine, and while we are not drinkers, it was so light and refreshing, my wife had seconds. 

They next brought an amuse bouche which was a beet served on a dollop of Goat Cheese. 

I had the 7 course tasting menu and was pleasantly surprised by each and every course. Started with Ahi Tuna over a shredded fennel slaw, next was the silkiest creamy onion soup I have ever had with just a touch of black truffle. Then to the veal ravioli, it wasn't bad but wasn't a highlight like the next course, which was a poached hamachi fillet served with a ginger sauce and mushrooms. So delicate and just full of flavor. That was followed up by the best lamb i have ever encountered. served over a couscous with a mango chutney. The pre-dessert course was a mango gelato served on banana bread, swimming in a coconut soup containing strawberries, tapioca pearls, and fried plantains. The final course was the low-light for me, a molten chocolate banana cake with a cup of espresso. I felt that the bitterness of the espresso really ruined all the beautiful flavors of everything else but i didn't eat enough of it to allow it to affect my incredible meal. 

My wife had the surf and turf which was a prime fillet with a butter poached lobster. It was served with a potato puree that is precisely what potatoes should taste like. 

The entire meal was just beyond words and lived up to my HIGH expectations. 

The Service was excellent and while expensive i felt it was worth the money. My only complaint is $5 for 8oz of soda. I'm OK with being gouged on the food but not on the soda's. All high end restaurants do it but I'm still not a fan of the practice.
