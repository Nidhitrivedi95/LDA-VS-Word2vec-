htQgj-ANQpZGpIpkkrEmyQ Amazing food and portions, though the server wasn't very helpful. I ordered the veg hanoi (veggie salad) and it was full of flavours and textures. Easily the best salad I've ever eaten! Extra side of fries costed $4, and my family ordered their burgers and steak salad which also were amazing with presentation and taste.
