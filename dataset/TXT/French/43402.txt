LUd3UdlUvCr54H-7ttm0TQ My first visit at this very popular resto...
And i can definitely say..... NOT MY LAST 
I liked how the food was presented and  the taste.... !!!
I had Spanakopita with egg , beets salad and yogurt ... it was delicious ..!!! 
We were lucky enough to get in .. as they ask us if we had a reservation... which we didn't ... when we left the restaurant was packed!!!
