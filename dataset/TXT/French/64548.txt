Tefx_N6A6nrsdj4jHHnbYg My wife and I dropped by in the late afternoon yesterday.  Emily, the owner, was behind the counter and greeted us with a big smile and warm personality.

The whole place has a great feel and ambiance to it.  It had great energy!

We ordered a cappuccino, a macchiato, an almond croissant and a chocolate croissant.  The coffee is excellent.  The croissants have delectable flavor and texture.  She informed me that they are sent from France and she bakes them.  Some of the best -- if not the best -- you'll find in the Valley.

We live in Anthem, and it's a good drive to get here, but we really liked it.  When in the SW Valley, we will be sure to drop by again......maybe she'll open another store in Anthem?
