i2dnic7VdQ3NyiQQWUXHbA This hidden resto/bar has a great vibe and cool decor but I didn't find it overly impressive. The drinks were great but incredibly expensive and service was almost completely absent. I had to get up twice to find our server despite us being the ONLY table. I ordered the full size steak tartare which was very good but didn't come with crackers or bread or anything to eat it on. Strange. 

Great food and drinks but super pricey and poor service. I wouldn't go back.
