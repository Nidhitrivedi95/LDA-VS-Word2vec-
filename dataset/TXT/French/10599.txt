Mon Ami Gabi should be on your "to-do" list for breakfast/brunch while you're in Vegas. Period. This restaurant came recommended by our waiter at Gordon Ramsay Burger the previous night (he was a foodie so we trusted his reco). We had reservations for 10:15 a.m. It was a Thursday morning so it wasn't particularly crowded, as I'm sure it gets on the weekends. The restaurant it pretty. They have a nice patio area where you can sit and enjoy your meal with a view of The Strip and the fountains at The Bellagio. We opted for indoor seating because the temperature was around 115 degrees.

Our waiter was very friendly and helpful and walked us through their breakfast specials for the day. We each ordered a wide array of breakfast items between the four of us and every dish was absolutely fantastic. My friends had the traditional Eggs Benedict, the Lemon Skinny Crêpes Pancakes, and the French Toast. I had the Chicken, Brie & Apple Crêpe. I'm a sucker for anything with Brie. Let me tell you, this dish was incredible perfection. I would eat it a million times over.

One of the best restaurants on The Strip, in my opinion. And that's saying something because there are a lot of really, really good restaurants there. I would love to return again for dinner to try out some different dishes, as I'm sure they're amazing as well.
