0nddnkjG1RV8hdFdy_wCMA mmmmmmmm  CROISSANTS!!!!!   Buttery flaky and you can't just eat one - so I grabbed a seat with a couple of friends and ordered a latte and another croissant and than moved onto the best onion tart I have ever had (outside of Paris)...   It was the last piece so I had to share ( the little selfish kid in me came out because I really did not want to).  Perfect balance of crust and onion and it is sweet and savoury and just yummy.  The place is small and cozy.   Haven't tried the quiche yet so I may have to visit again sometime very soon!
