QEgfK_TKY8bwK-YzKDdkGw I was with a group of 7 for our first visit to Lumiere and it was wonderful.  We started out with the escargot, octopus, duck confit, mussels, and the oysters and all appetizers were delicious.  Everyone in our group either had the bouillabaise or the boar with truffle mac n cheese and everyone was very please.  They have a great wine selection and our server was very helpful with recomendations.  We will definitely go back!
