HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw Modern French bistro American style tucked away on the third floor in the Cosmopolitan Hotel.  Superb location as it overlooks the Strip, has floor to ceiling windows letting in lots of natural light.  However you could also sit near the front of the restaurant which is darker and more tavern-like.  I'd been wanting to try the Comme Ca burger since we visited the Melrose location so I was really looking forward to dining here.  I knew their cocktails were solid so that justified the $15 price tag ($15 is average in Vegas; the question becomes whether it is worth the $15) - I had the Aviation (gin, lemon, infused cherry) which was strong and refreshing albeit a bit small.  Then the Prohibition Punch - really liked it and was more along the lines of what I was looking for - crisp, sweet, refreshing but strong. Actually this was my favorite place for specialty cocktails; definitely superior to La Cave or Sage IMHO.  Then we had the oysters to start, and while I am not a huge oyster fan, these were very good, fresh, tasty.  Then the burger medium rare which was excellent.  Fries are pretty close to perfect - crunchy on the outside but soft on the inside.  The aioli is the string that ties it all together.  Will return for sure.
