U1LB3sRMGTu_h7Sf9QdNoA Amazing, this place is just amazing.  Finally we have in Toronto a great coffee place.  It is like a little bit of France in Toronto. The pastries are outstanding, the coffee is great and the service is just extraordinary.  My favourite is the almond croissant, and the sandwiches are just FANTASTIC!!! 
The owner is very friendly, she is just amazing.  I absolutely enjoy Le Neuf every time.  I go there sometimes to study and I feel like at home.  The only thing is that I wish they can open late.
