bVuPp6xuI4UPXlAEkEd2bA last weekend my mom and i went to montreal. though it was a short trip, it was a lot of fun.  our saturday had been a day of HOURS at the open air market, a picnic in the botanical gardens, and a major bike ride back to our hotel.  it was longer than i had expected, and left me sweaty, frustrated with bicycles, and incredibly hungry.  i knew almost immediately what i was craving: steak frites.

my mother humored me and my insane craving for beef and fried potatoes and we checked every restaurant in the area of our hotel until we found exactly something labeled "steak-frites" on the menu.  and boy howdy, did we luck out.  both of us being winos, the line "bar a vin" caught both our eyes and the "steak-frites" caught mine.

it was a beautiful saturday evening, and we seemed to have arrived at exactly the right moment, because we were not only seated within minutes of arrival, but we were seated at a fabulous table in the corner of their outdoor seating area.

fast-forward to our eating, and while i did feel terrible for my mom because of a mix up in the kitchen leaving her to wait an extra 10-15 minutes for dinner, we both had marvelous meals.  the butter atop that steak was so heavenly, i asked how it was made.  our waitress came back with a written recipe. my mom's salmon was incredible as well and we both ate every bite.

while the price wasn't something we'd spend every day, it was the last night of vacation and we enjoyed it very much.  the service was great, i left with a steak-frites baby, and we both left very happy.
