4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Had a nice Sunday brunch at Mon Ami Gabi. Our server was great, attentive but not too stuffy. Loved the make-your-own bloody mary bar, the french onion soup and the mussels. Mimosas were also delicious because they used fresh-squeezed oranges. Steak frites entree was good, the meat is thin so dont get anything over medium.
