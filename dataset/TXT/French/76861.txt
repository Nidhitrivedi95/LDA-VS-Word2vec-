ysJo5Jdo29XOBCnKrbUKWg So this text I sent to my BF pretty much sums up my experience:

"I cheated on you and went to Paris 66 for brunch. I am experiencing an omelet epiphany. This is the best omelet I have ever had and I don't know why. It's just salmon,  spinach, and Swiss cheese but it's incredibly good.  It must have something to do with how the ingredients were prepared and how the omelet was cooked. I cannot replicate this dish."

I've been here several times and the food has always been excellent,  interesting, and worth the calories. They also have a great wine list. 

**Do not come here if you're tight on time! 
This is a casual little French cafe with a tiny kitchen that prepares all dishes from scratch when ordered. Nothing is prepackaged or frozen; therefore, it takes more time for the entrees to arrive than it does at most restaurants. As long as you are expecting this,  you will probably have a great experience (besides,  it's an excellent excuse to have an extra glass of wine).
