jwYnXuaSqtpiNwyU72Vm9Q I went with my family a few months ago. All their meals were good and I would give it a 4-star rating, but I ordered octopus and instead of bringing me balsamic vinegar they brought me soy sauce. It ruined the entire meal, so I told them to take it back and bring it back with vinegar...they brought it back with soy again. One mistake is acceptable, 2 is not.
