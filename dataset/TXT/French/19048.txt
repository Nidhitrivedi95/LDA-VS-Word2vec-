ANHCo9X7zu0LdYecc9fk3Q Overall: Small slightly-expensive breakfast spot with a touch of faux-French. Nothing extra ordinary, but you are at an airport.

Menu: Lot of options for food, and faux-French items. I had their Breakfast Croissant. It was fairly big and delicious but also $8.

Price: Expect to pay airport rates

Service: Food comes in to-go containers. Coffee is fairly good.
