rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw Love love the food. Came here for a bachelorette dinner with 11 other ladies. Everything was so scrumptious, but it was just too much food. We could've done a 3 course meal and it would've been more than enough. But I guess it's Vegas, so go big or go home. 

1st course consists of family style appetizers: charcuterie board, duck wings a l'orange and escargot Bardot. 

2nd- I ordered shrimp cocktail and a friend of mine ordered steak tartare. Normally not a big fan of steak tartare, but this was delicious. 

3rd- I got the rack of lamb which just melted in my mouth. It was so so tender and bloody, the way I like my meat. 

4th- dessert trio (creme brûlée, chocolate macaron and profiteroles)
