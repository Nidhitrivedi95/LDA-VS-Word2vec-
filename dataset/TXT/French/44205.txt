ME6D5nLlfG0xZCtICOYDuw I came here on a Tuesday night with a friend and the restaurant was about half full. The hostess greeted us immediately and showed us to a table-one that was in between two other tables. This frustrated me a bit since half of the restaurant was full and my friend and I wanted to have a private, serious conversation. However, having been a hostess previously, I understand serving sections and why she may have sat us where she did. 

The service was fantastic though maybe a little too attentive. When you're in the middle of a conversation, you'd like to not be interrupted several times. I ordered a glass of Sancerre which really disappointed me. It was a good pour but it tasted like an old bottle. 

On to the food, the waiter was very helpful in making suggestions but I regret taking them. My friend and I had already chosen to start with salads--the beet and arugula for me and Caesar for her--both fantastic. There were plenty of gorgeous red and yellow beets in mine and it paired well with the peppery arugula and pistachios. The entrees were a bit expensive, so we decided to each get hor d'oeuvres and share. She decided on the crab cake and I chose the lamb sausage. BAD MISTAKE. The crab cake was burned on the outside from sauteing it and I've had way better crab cakes. The lamb sausage--disgusting. I've never eaten something with that weird of a taste before. I couldn't even eat it. Not only was the lamb sausage not spicy, it had the most revolting flavor. It was paired with couscous and figs. The server had so highly recommended it that we almost ordered 2 of those instead; I'm glad we at least got the crab cake. 

If you venture to George's, steer clear of those two hor d'oeuvres. The descriptions may tempt you but you're probably better off getting a salad and entree. I'd come here again to try something different and would like to try it during happy hour...
