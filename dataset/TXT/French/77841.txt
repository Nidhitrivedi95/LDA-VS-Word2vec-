YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g I really enjoyed a late lunch here with my husband.  We ate on the comfy chairs by the bar, overlooking the hotel/casino.

My husband had the steak and fries.  He loved it and rated it a 10/10.

I had a cheese appetizer that was a soft mozzarella with olive oil and a splash of balsamic vinegar on the side.  It was perfect for a late lunch or snack.  It was $16 for the cheese and bread.  I asked for a bit more balsamic vinegar and was told that it costs $60 a bottle so could have extra regular balsamic vinegar.  
Well, it WAS really good.
