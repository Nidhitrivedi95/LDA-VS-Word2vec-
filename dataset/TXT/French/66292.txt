Sorry we didn't try the Mac and Cheese. The only down note here was the Chicken Caesar salad was completely unremarkable - like what you'd get at a neighborhood diner.

A couple of items on the menu weren't available, which is what you'd expect if they are serving locally sourced food and being discriminating about what they buy and serve, so that fact actually gave me more confidence in them.
