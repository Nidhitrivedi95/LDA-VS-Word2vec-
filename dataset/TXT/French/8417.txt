The quality dropped drastically to when I last had it 3 years ago. I got the french onion soup (~$11). There was a huge block of cheese followed by the soup. I didn't remember the soup being so salty. I ate it with the whole baguette because it was so salty. Pro tip, combine the cheese with the bread and you get cheesy bread.

You can make a reservation through open table since this place does get crowded. The thing with open table with this particular restaurant is that you have to put down a credit card.
