iwFoA98-OgcdXmNS0LxNOA A great place to enjoy Beer on a Saturday night. Had an amazing time with my family. 

We ordered Poutines with Maxi Fries and Onion Rings since that was all we wanted to take in with the Beer and well, we have a little less variery in Vegetarian meals there... But the Poutine was amazing! We ordered it twice as a matter of fact! 

The place sometimes is really crowded and its difficult to call someone for service, but the waiters are all really friendly and really help u decide what will be best for u!
