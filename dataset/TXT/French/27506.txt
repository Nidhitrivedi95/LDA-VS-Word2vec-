dj2KhjtZBC3Y1IrAsDXYng So since my last review we've been to the restaurant twice and I still find it a bit hit and miss.  What's good is really good, but when it's not it's very disappointing, particularly at those prices.  

We had crab cakes which were excellent with nice crispy exteriors and light, fluffy and flavorful interiors.  They were served with chipotle mayonnaise with just the right amount of heat to complement and not overwhelm the delicate crab taste.  I Also tried their appetizer of "escargots bourgogne" which were escargots and mushrooms lightly braised in wine (just like beef bourgogne) and topped with a piece of smoked bison belly which was advertized as "bacon".  The escargot were a little overwhelmed by the wine sauce and the braising didn't do much for their texture.  The saving grace was the bison belly which was braised right along with the escargot and mushrooms and was spectacular.  I could have eaten a larger piece as a main course.  It was loaded with flavor and was soft and luscious as a braised piece of belly should be.  They do themselves a disservice simply referring to this as a bacon topping in the menu!!
I've also sampled two mains - the venison which was beautifully cooked and presented in a lovely reduction.  It was venison as venison is meant to be served.  I also had the "duck two ways", which was a duck confit and duck breast.  The breast was delicious and again cooked perfectly and served with a mashed potato with a little parsnip that was heavenly - the two vegetables were beautifully balanced together..  The confit however was disappointingly hard and lacked any skin or crispiness so a real disappointment.  My wife had a risotto which was very average.
At both meals I asked for wine recommendations - the first was spot on and the second very disappointing so also a little hit and miss.
