oJZNHz5UUVUgrZwVBVlpYw We proceeded to the Bellagio specifically because I'd wanted to try the caviar at Petrossian. I had wanted to try it the last time we were there, but couldn't because lil guy wasn't allowed in since it was served at the bar. So, we managed to find a daycare for him while we ran off to sample the 'black salt' (as hubby calls it).

We got there as it opened at 12pm and settled into comfy seats. We both ordered Perrier ($4.50) and was faced with a sour faced server. I was like WTF?? We're paying customers regardless of what we order. However, when I ordered a 30g Alverta caviar ($185) and hubby a shot of Christiania vodka ($10), that same server's entire demeanor changed. Fucking hell. I mean seriously. Just because we weren't dressed nicely doesn't mean we were vagrants. Give me a break.

Well, I was kind of disappointed with the caviar. At $185/30g I'd expected far better quality than the one we got. I've tried many types of caviar before and I really preferred Osetra caviar to the Alverta but dammit, I wasn't going to pay $350/30g for it. Screw that. They serve the caviar with a 'bread basket' of toast triangles and baby blinis, but the problem was, the warm blinis served together with the toast created steam which meant the toast was soggy when it reached us. Also, the carb to caviar ratio was ridiculous. There was enough toast and blini for about 500g of caviar.

Still, it was great that hubby finally has changed his thoughts about caviar. The caviar at Petrossian starts at $145 and tops at over $1000. Maybe one day I'll feel generous enough to plop down $300+ for 30g of caviar at a whim, but that day isn't going to be any time soon.

1-star off for the two faced server.
