DwJlGxAJvohbDR_5jV-ERA We stopped in bc it had heated outdoor seating and was open early. So glad we did. The French/American style breakfast was amazing. My 3 year old loved his bagel, my husband devoured his "hungry man" egg platter, and I reminisced as I ate a lovely salad and smoked salmon croissant. 
Wait staff was friendly and service was quick. Coffee was good and they were on top of keeping the cups full.
