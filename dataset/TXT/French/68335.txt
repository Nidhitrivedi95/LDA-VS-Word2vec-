vg55SAkrEmuHpWfIMtJjBQ Wow, talk about commitment...to great food!  This place rocks and deserves all the superb reviews its received.  I ordered the Aubrey as a pre-dinner drink and wasn't all that fond of it, but I'll put the blame on myself more b/c I don't like champagne and was told that these drinks are lighter/bubbly in nature.  So not going to punish Legume for my poor judgment.

On to the entree, I got the barley risotto with flat iron steak and carrot puree and a wine sauce.  Wowzer - it was sooooo good.  I got my steak medium (rather than medium rare) and while it was still a little pink it was really tender.  The risotto, puree, and sauce were great compliments to the steak.  It was also a perfectly sized portion.  

I chose the salted caramel ice cream for desert and it was surprisingly delicious.  I'm saying "surprisingly" b/c I was hesitant about getting the ice cream, thinking it may be too creamy or just not my taste, but it's exactly what I wanted!  

My friends got the gingerbread desert and the other got to the chocolate truffle cake.  While I'm not a huge gingerbread fan - if you do like that flavor then get ready for a flavor explosion in your mouth!  Now I must admit I had a bit of truffle cake envy - it was heavenly!  And ideally I think it would have been amazing if they had a scoop of the salted caramel ice cream to accompany that cake or the cake as a great side to the ice cream.  You get my drift - pair them together and you'll be in desert heaven.

I would definitely recommend this place and look forward to more visits.
