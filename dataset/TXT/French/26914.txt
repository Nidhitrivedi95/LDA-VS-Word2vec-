Dcj69NZJnbJhK-YHP_nULA Been here many times. Some good and some so-so points:

1) Excellent beer selection. If you're a fan of Belgian-style beers, you'll love it. A lot of beers on tap.
2) Coffee is excellent. They give you a small french press.
3) Food is tasty, but not amazing. Would have given four stars, but they don't allow substitutions or changes.
