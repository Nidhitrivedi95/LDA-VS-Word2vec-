XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q I am very confused by the negative reviews on here.  I have eaten here twice.  Once was the 16 course menu once was the 4 course.  Both were extremely filling.

Service:  Exceptional from the moment we walked in.  Polite and inviting host team.  Our waiters were very knowledgeable and gave excellent recommendations.

The Food:  Ok, everyone agrees the bread cart is the stuff of legends.  Everything I had there was done perfectly. Each item on both menus were unique and wonderful.

The price: Expensive.  Very Expensive.  Could I have a dining experience as good for less?  Yes.  Areoles comes to mind.  I could get this experience duplicated anywhere else? NO!  Truly this place is all about the food, service and overall experience.  Very worthwhile.
