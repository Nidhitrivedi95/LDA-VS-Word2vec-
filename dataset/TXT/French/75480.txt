Ycp3Agr7dt71TZkeKV7jng Le Gourmand has great tasting pastries, especially their cookies. They offer an assortment of high-quality and good tasting breakfast, lunch, and dinner options, you can find a full menu listing on their website.  

I recommend trying an almond croissant and/or their grilled prosciutto sandwich.

It's a good hang-out place, lots of seating, nice atmosphere.  They have a side-walk patio which is great in warm weather.
