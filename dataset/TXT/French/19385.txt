aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw My boyfriend & I actually got lost trying to find this place lol. It was worth it :) 

Not only are the macarons huge, but they were light & delicious. Unfortunately my raspberry didn't taste light & delicious, but my favorites are pistachio & lemon! 

If you're ever in the Venetian or if you're a macacron lover, you should stop by here before leaving Vegas!
