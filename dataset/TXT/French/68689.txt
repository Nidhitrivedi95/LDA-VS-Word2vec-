VmSkQsAjUtzJeliKeGQCOQ Pretty safe to say this is the best sit down Italian food in Stouffville. There are a few other options, that may have fancier settings, but this place seems to have the best flavor. 

Came here with 7 family members so I was able to taste several dishes. Everyone was very pleased with the flavor, portions, and service. 

The interior of the restaurant seemingly hasn't changed from when this restaurant used to be an Italian restaurant called "Franos", which was also quite good. ViPei has stepped up the menu since the days of Franos. Although I think the new name is weak.

First I want to say that all the pasta was cooked to perfect al dente. I would highly recommend the Tri-Color Tortellini. Great spinach cream sauce with mushrooms and smoked bacon. Also the Chicken Gorgonzola penne was top notch. Their cheesy cream sauce was very rich and it has great toppings including mushroom varieties and my personal favorite, sundried tomatoes. 

Avoid the calamari appetizer, seems obviously of the frozen variety. Not great. But they offer free bread with oil and balsamic, so no worries on the appetizers.

All in all, this place is great for VERY solid Italian food. Great selection on the menu and they feature a lot of seafood. Literally a hidden gem in Stouffville. This place sits between a Subway and Enterprise Rent-A-Car. Definitely give it a try!
