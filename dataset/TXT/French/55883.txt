rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A We had brunch at Bouchon on our last day in Las Vegas during a bachelorette party weekend.
The food was great!
But the main highlight was our server Damien Drake. He was extremely friendly, funny and helpful.
I recommend that you eat at Bouchon if you are staying at the Venetian. Go for the food, but make sure to ask for Damien Drake!
