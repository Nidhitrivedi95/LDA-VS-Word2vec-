4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw The service and food was wonderful.  I had the corn beef and hash and a cup of coffee for brunch.  The corn beef wasn't the typical canned beef and it was top of the line meat! Nicely flavored beef indeed :) And the coffee surprisingly want the usually weak diner coffee.  Over all very pleased!
