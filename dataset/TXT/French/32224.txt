gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA Alize was outstanding.  This is a new favorite for us in Las Vegas.  The views of the Las Vegas skyline are stunning, and I highly recommend visiting at sunset or after dark where the city and traffic provide constant entertainment.

The food was incredible, and while it's not given away, it would be worth the price even without the dramatic and romantic setting.  I've had less appealing meals at much higher priced restaurants in Las Vegas.  Highly recommended.
