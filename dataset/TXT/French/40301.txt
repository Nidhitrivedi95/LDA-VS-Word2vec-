KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA We came back here two years later to try it out again.

First and foremost, the service was excellent. We had the hostess greet us kindly and sat us immediately. It was very busy for Sunday morning brunch, but they seemed to handle it very well. 

Our waiter was awesome and was always making sure to check up on us and that we had enough drinks and that our orders were coming out in a timely manner. I was very impressed and happy. 

As I had stated in my previous review, the food here has never been bad, and has still never been bad. 

We had - 

Crab Cake Benedict - Just as good as we remembered. Cooked perfectly, the Hollandaise sauce was delicious and overall exceptional. 
The Tuffled Grits and Beef Grillades - The waiter recommended this dish. I wasn't too fond of it. I ordered it because I order anything that has Truffles in it. I'm obsessed with the smell and flavor. The dish really did not have a strong truffle smell. I guess I wasn't a fan of it for breakfast food. I think I would want this type of dish more for dinner. But, to each their own. It was still tasty! 

They serve great mimosas and are quick to top you off. And they have bottomless for $20pp if you're interested. 

Overall, we were very happy to go back and try this place again. As always, it's very clean, nice chill music with a pretty view of the pond. We love watching the black swans that are swimming around. 

Can't wait to go back for dinner!
