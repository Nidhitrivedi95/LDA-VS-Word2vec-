eJ9L40jm5VOXCIq7xs9kQw Service was wonderful, but a little slow to the table. Food did come out promptly though. Tasting menu was well balanced and offered a great selection. Wine selection was diverse and paired wonderfully with the meal. Environment/setting was perfect as well. Price point was very fair.
