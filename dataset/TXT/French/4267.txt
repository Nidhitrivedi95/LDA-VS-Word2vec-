I ordered the country style soup and roasted beet salad, which were very complementary. The beets were cooked just right and had good flavor. The pickles and mustard were also a nice starter at the beginning of the meal (they provide you with a huge jar of pickles for the table). The decor of this place is super cute and European -- I recommend it!
