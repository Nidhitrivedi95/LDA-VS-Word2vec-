XZ7eQLjyGXf6y69UT4SGhg These are legit pastries, not that whack shit you would get at Vons or like Walmart. I believe these are french pastries and they are amazing. Prices are reasonable as well. The pastry here reminds me of the ones I would get at hotels and casino's minus the hotel and casino price.
