L6RxkP8dneVGelDLUhjCug Oh So Good is right on!!! I came in only wanting to buy the pate chaud and left with so much more. A customer who was patiently waiting for some fresh baked items recommended the Vietnamese sandwich and croissants and a few other items. She raved about it and so I tried them. I must say, the Vietnamese special sandwich is hands down the best I have ever had!! The bread was soft and crunchy at the same time and the filling... I am just reliving the amazement of how wonderful all those flavors blended together. Oh I got the flat almond crisp... I originally bought just 1 but ended up eating it while standing in line to pay and had to buy an extra one for the road. Yes... soooo good! And and and the pate Chaud pork is the bomb!!! I will be back later to try their hue thieu!
