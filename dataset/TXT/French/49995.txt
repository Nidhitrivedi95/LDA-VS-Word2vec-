oS96aJIHFWcFAlGHKKXjaw I stopped by here a few Saturday's ago with my girlfriend for breakfast.  We were going to try to get there at a little after 9 but didn't look at the hours until we were on our way there.   So in route we found out that it didn't open until 9:30 but as we had been wanting to come here for awhile, we decided to wait in our car.  It became fortuitous though as shortly after we got there a line started forming outside and so we quickly inserted ourselves in the queue.  Whenever the doors opened promptly at 9:30 there was quite a bit of a line behind us and not everyone was able to make it into the store.  The store itself is quite cute with a display counter taking up a large portion of the room with a brick wall behind it with a chalkboard menu and French flag.  Everything in the display case looked wonderful and led to a tough decision on what I would want later. There were also two small two-tops inside and we saw some workers carrying a few more tables out the door while we were waiting to purchase our breakfast.  

I decided to go with one of the combos that they had on their menu which was a tart au brie with a coffee.  After I ordered the cashier asked me if I wanted it warmed up to which I replied that I did.  In the meantime I sat down at one of the two tops with my girlfriend and enjoyed my coffee which was fairly good.  I thoroughly enjoyed our seat inside as the volume of people coming in and lining up outside made for some good people watching.  A short time later my brie tart was finished being heated and I was able to eat it.  Man was it delicious with the warm brie tasting amazing on the puff pastry!  My girlfriend and I also really enjoyed her almond croissant which she was nice enough to give me a taste of.

The bottom line for me is that I will definitely be headed back here in the future.  I loved both the feel of this place as well as the food and I am excited that they will have Sunday hours after Mothers Day.
