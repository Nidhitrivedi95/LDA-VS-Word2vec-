FJMMPL3pxAPYGEPB0Hwlhw I had the Cheese Risotto with Black Truffle.
I Was pretty excited for this dish because it came with three things I really like: risotto, cheese and black truffle. But it ended up disappointing. The risotto was very tough like it was undercooked (instead of aldente). The cheese was kinda salty and overpowered the truffle taste.

The service was disappointing too. Being a high-end restaurant, I expected service to be top notch. But then I guess this is one of those high-end restaurant where you may be pre-judged if you're getting a good service or not.

I called the server to say that the risotto was too tough than usual. And initially, the server didn't even believe me and made it seem like I didn't know what a risotto is and how it should be. I had to tell him I've eaten a lot of risotto (even on authentic Italian restaurants) so it's not new to me and this was the toughest one I'd had. It's only then he'd take my dish and asked if I wanted it re-made or changed.
