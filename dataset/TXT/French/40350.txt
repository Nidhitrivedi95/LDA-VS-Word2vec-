KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA I give 2 for the location only, the place itself is a bit all over the place, unorganized/neat, the design could've been much better it's a shame cuz it's a very nice big space.
the service and accommodation is ehh, our server only came once to take order and to give the check where I had to say excuse me cuz she kept passing in front of us without looking over nor did she even ask how was the food in between.
 I wish they would cooperate with their guests request like the ability to also serve lunch specialties daily including weekends like Sunday. For someone who doesn't live here and is on a weekend visit and would like to try the restaurant for what it's known for they can't cuz of whatever reason they have etc etc. I ended up not ordering anything else as I was simply looking forward to their foie gras. I wanted to leave but my bf made me stay. I guess my expectations are higher from restaurants cuz my experience in French restaurants in LA is just impeccable, they're more accommodating and value the experience of their guests. Well food was wasn't all that bad, steak was too much salt and pepper (I tried from my bf, didn't order it) I actually didn't order anything. When we were done, I walked out the restaurant and not the hostess or anyone even said thank you or anything. I certainly won't recommend my friends who constantly travel and go to fine restos as they're expectations would be same as mine nor I will return here anyway. It's too bad I really was looking forward to this place.
