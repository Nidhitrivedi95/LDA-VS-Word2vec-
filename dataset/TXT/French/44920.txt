mT8Ej8sKFJoIa5G0Vl4AKA Blindsided. Place is expensive. I live in Bklyn and my drink here at Bâton Rouge was $15 and my forgettable burger was $15. Never again. At Coppelia's in NYC I can get a juicy, seasoned burger WITH pork for $8.59 and a strong drink for $11.00 and that's on West 14th Street! SMH. Tourist trap.

After 7 hours of driving my stomach canceled out my brain.
