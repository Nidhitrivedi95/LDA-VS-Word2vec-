bGao_iVv3TAYcZ_5y9bOCQ What a wonderful place. We arrived after a long drive, without reservations and the restaurant was packed. The lead server had us wait while he made arrangements for to be seated and we were within five minutes. Service was super, friendly bilingual staff, which was good since we both speak rudimentary French! The only negative was they don't serve wine but do cork. That wasn't listed in Yelp and I couldn't get the website link to load.
