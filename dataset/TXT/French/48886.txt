I'm a self proclaimed old fashioned snob, and unfortunately they don't make it the pre-prohibition styled, & instead prefer to kill the taste with muddled crap( cherry and orange )! 

Service was above average. 
Atmosphere was average, for the Vegas scene. 
Beer glass smelled like crap, prompting my wife to drink out of the bottle. 
Good, strong martinis.
