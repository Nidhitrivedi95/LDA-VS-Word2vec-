kGOr_D-LNpgZ2M9N8TT4QQ I like this place! It's a classy, fancy restaurant that's good for happy hour. I noticed a lot of business people come here so it definitely has an older, mature atmosphere. I recommend dressing at least semi-formal coming to this place. The service was great! The waitress checked up on us regularly. The food is definitely pricey but it's good. My friends ordered oysters and I got a medium-rare steak with french fries. We all ordered scotch as our drink. There are a bunch of TVs around the restaurant to watch sports and other miscellaneous things. You can either be seated near the bar or in the dining area.

In my opinion, this is a place I would go to for happy hour and have a couple drinks by myself or with co-workers. I also might take a date here for some fine wine and dining.
