KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA I've been coming here since 2005 and have had a great experience every single time. I love the fact that they have a great wine store and you can buy the wine and drink it for a small fee. That certainly beats paying double or triple which is what most restaurants do.the View is awesome especially close to sunset. I certainly have my favorites on the menu as i have dined here dozens of times but always seem to order the escargot and mussels. the cheese plate is awesome as well. I usually always try something different for the main course and sometimes just keeping ordering more mussels as the main as they are that good. We also used them for catering our holiday party which everyone enjoyed! Keep up the great work
