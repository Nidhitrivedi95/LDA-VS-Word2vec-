LQ_gYNs5E10IGFE0NOyD7A Really disappointing. Awesome service (Love Rachel) and good ambience but poor execution on the food. The momofuko and Korean buns were pretty tasty but everything else was just meh. Ordered the Chinese wings-too much hoisin, the fried chicken picnic-too oily, the Cuban sandwich-too much Dijon, and the Brussels sprout salad-meh. I would not come back.
