5fquJHY2hMX9tPRD5s0t5g New location off to a great start. Short ribs live up to their reputation. Had mac & cheese and au gratin potatoes as sides-both made with goat cheese and both very yummy. A bit loud which made conversation across the table difficult, but is you want good food and a lively environment it's a great choice in Uptown.
