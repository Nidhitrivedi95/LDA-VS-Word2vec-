O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q Pleasantly surprised.  Some of the reviews were less than flattering, but my party of eight was very happy.

- Easy to find
- Excellent service
- Nice space, not too loud
- The charcuterie board was above average, but not excellent.  Good cheeses, especially the mimolette.  The cured meats were pretty standard
- The beef tartare was average by itself, but combined with Morels' homemade ruffles, it was excellent
- The steak (prime rib eye) was very nicely aged.  Nice and meaty, tender, full of flavor.  I tasted the beef rather than salt and butter, which was refreshing in a high end steakhouse
