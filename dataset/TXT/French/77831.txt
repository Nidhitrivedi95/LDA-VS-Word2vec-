First off. Anyone who goes to the webite for this place, looks at the menu, and sees a bunch of things they can't relate to because they've never seen them before and decides from there not to go are making a HUGE mistake.

This place is all about the flavors. Everything and I mean everything has been crafter to provide a unique flavor experience. 

Looking back on this meal I feel as though I expereiced a mini tasting menu from a restaurant with a Michelin star but at a fraction of the price. It was that good!

Normally I like to point out a few dishes in particular that stood out but everything here was good enough to stand on its own its hard to do so, though the truffle soup and the mussels were good candidates.

As for value, my wife and I came away full and very happy and it only set us back $85 without wine. For what you get, that ain't bad at all.

Highly recommended.
