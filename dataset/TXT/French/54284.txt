rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw If you do nothing else stop in for a chicken while your in the neighborhood.. The bites of leek stuffing alone make it worth it and you have not even gotten to the award winning skin and perfectly cook meat.. How are the legs & thighs both cooked perfectly while still attached?? It's a mystery, but why doesn't matter.. What matters is the chicken, go get the chicken.
