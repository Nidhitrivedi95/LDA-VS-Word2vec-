mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q What an amazing dining experience.  My boyfriend and I came here a couple of weeks ago and each got the seasonal tasting menu.  This place earns it's Michelin star, not in the traditional formal way with 4 star service (the service was prompt but much more casual than other $$$$ restaurants I've been to), but by focusing solely on the food.  The seasonal tasting menu had 9 courses, was perfectly sized, flavored, seasoned, etc.  I was VERY satisfied when I left.  

Although I've never bought a dinner for anywhere close to $500 for two people before, if you're going to splurge here anyway, I highly recommend the seasonal tasting menu.  It was every bit as delicious as I hoped it would be.
