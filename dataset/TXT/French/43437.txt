LWDWVUJnwSUyDWOmgW1rqQ One fine day we were walking on Mont-Royal and noticed this diner. Being breakfast people, we walked in to check out the place where the owner told us to come in for the best breakfast in town.

Turns out said owner had a lot of nerve calling this food; it looks like something that needs to be chucked. Smells like yesterday's garbage. Service, on top of bad food, was horrible and non-existent. I would have given it to a homeless person, but why hurt a homeless person.

In closing, if you are looking for a strong case of indigestion, bad atmosphere and just bad food, then go visit them ... Dog food probably tastes better!
