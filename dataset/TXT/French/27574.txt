DJcvnN7BCiqOUAra35xYuA This  is a tiny place downtown but very quaint. Nice atmosphere as well. My friend and  I came here for lunch as we were craving pho and thought we would try this place out. 
Waiter was nice and had a great smile. We got the menu and it was pretty small but it seemed to have enough on the menu. lots of spring roll options. Too many too remember. However after looking at the prices for just one, my friend and I decided to pass as we would have been looking at $20 for lunch, which sucks. lol
The Pho was GREAT. It had good flavor  and after a little siracha etc., it was even better!  Again it was a little costly...$11!  I did like the place but will try to find somewhere near for better  priced lunch specials. I will come back though.
