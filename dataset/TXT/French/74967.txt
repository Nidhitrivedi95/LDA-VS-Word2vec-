XZ7eQLjyGXf6y69UT4SGhg I stopped at Cafe Breizh for the first time and it was OK, not A-OK.  It had been a bookmark for quite awhile and Saturday morning seemed like a good time.

I was ready to order and got out two words when the young woman taking my order interrupted and said she was sorry but she'd be right back.It took her five minutes--perhaps longer--before she came back to the take my order.  During the time, she was packing take out boxes and I waited.  I ordered a galette, the Chevrotine and a cappuccino for eating there and a Nutella brioche to take out.  She gave me a table sign with a number so they would know where to bring the breakfast.

Then I waited.  It was between 20 and 25 minutes before my galette was brought to the table.  By then I was a bit irritated for the wait.  There were a number of staff there but they just couldn't do the take out orders and the in house orders in a timely fashion.  

The galette arrived and I still had not received my coffee.  Then I realized it was get your own from the counter when they placed it on the glass and call your name.  You need to develop a teacher's voice so people can hear you.  I retrieved my cappuccino and was finally ready to begin what turned into a frustrating breakfast.

The galette was made with mushrooms, bacon, and goat cheese.  It was OK.  I would have preferred the bacon to be in smaller pieces than whole slices but it was OK.  I brought the Nutella brioche home and had it later.

This was a one and done experience for me.  The service is so slow and the price point for the three items was high.
