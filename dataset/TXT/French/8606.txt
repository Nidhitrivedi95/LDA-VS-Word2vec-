4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Service is great, food is amazing and overall experience is great. Alcohol is always surprising inexpressive for a strip location. That said, my only complaint is they add a small percentage of the fee for what the waitress told me was health expenses for the employees. I don't know if she was right but would have at least liked to have been told about this before hand.
