4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I was excited to go here because of the 4 star reviews on Yelp, but ended up disappointed. I ordered the steak and fries. I thought hey, thin cut fries! They'll be sooo crispy, like potato chips! Yay! But in fact, the fries were.. Chewy. I didn't know that you can make potato chewy. As for the steak, it was way too salty for me. I didn't really enjoy my steak or fries. The service was quick and good though.
