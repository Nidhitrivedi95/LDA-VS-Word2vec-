4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Great venue, clutch place for a first date/anniversary/special event. Sit outside so you get a good view of the fountain show (well worth). The food here is pretty damn good. My favorite by far is the pesto escargo. These savory treats are served in 6 small yet delicious pieces that's worth every bite. The bread they give you while you wait for your meal is very good.

The steak are to die for. Considering that this place is on the Strip, the prices are actually pretty decent. No need to break the bank to dine at this place.

This place is definitely one of my go-to spots for any type of special event.
