FChZqoNWuLZr5Lj28Cq7yg Go to Tartine!!! This little restaurant is charming and just what the West End area needs to perk up the once thriving town. 

We went for lunch at 12 on the dot and the place was slammed. The poor waitress was on her own but gracefully hopped from table to table. The owner came in and greeted everyone, stopping to talk with everyone as if they were old friends and thanking guests for coming.

We each had a dish: quiche with bacon, chicken/olive/hard boiled egg sandwich, croque monsieur and everyone ordered and LOVED the lyonnaise potatoes. 

We all shared a delicious dessert of chocolate cake with orange flavor, white and chocolate squares around the outside. The desserts are brought in from Montreal and they're delicious.
