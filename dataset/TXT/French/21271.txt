B56AYe5GNuavMDtwFsXqzA We randomly found this restaurant via Yelp while we were in Scottsdale on a Sunday night, and we couldn't have been happier with our meal.   Great, traditional French food, in a nice atmosphere with excellent service.

Reservations: We called when they opened on Sunday afternoon and were able to get their last reservation at 8pm.

Location: We stayed at Hotel Indigo, which was just a few blocks away.  For anyone staying at the W you have no excuse not to go as it is literally in the shadow of the W.

Atmosphere: The interior is a fairly narrow wooden space with a bar on the left and tables on the right.  Despite the narrow space they've managed to make it feel open and airy without feeling like a modern restaurant.  We ate outside on the patio, which is quite spacious.  There is a working fireplace on one side as well as plenty of umbrellas and heat lamps to protect you from the elements.

Service: We arrived a bit before our reservation and were seated quickly.  Both the hostess and our waiter were quick, friendly, professional, and helpful.  We never had to wait long for anything, but also never felt like people were hovering over us.

Food: 
 - Soupe a l'onion: Exactly as you'd like it.  Rich, tons of onions, and great gruyere.
 - Steak frites: My wife ordered this and I tried both her steak and her fries.  Perfectly cooked steak with a ton of flavor.  The pommes frites were nice and skinny, not overly fried, and made with a darker potato (almost like a sweet potato) with a much richer, earthier flavor than your average fry.
 - Porc Roti: While I was initially a little disappointed that they had run out of lamb, I was more than pleased when I tasted the roast pork chop.  Probably the best pork chop I've ever had.  The cider gastrique and along with the winter chutney that included some foie gras was an excellent mix of sweet and savory, while the chop itself was very moist.  I'm not a huge fan of butternut squash, but this dish may make me rethink my opinion.

Value: Excellent.  Every entree was less than $20, the portion sizes were good, and they have a good selection of reasonably priced wines.
