LnSjzFXh1GrOObsRP6LhBQ Came here for lunch today. Had the croque Monsieur and the mushroom bisque. I think it was around $10 in total. 

I really likes the soup. Lots of mushrooms and a nice broth. Very fresh tasting and the cup seemed like a decent portion. The croque mosieur was very rich with a nice topping of cheese. 

The Atmosphere of the place seems nice but it looks like it gets quite busy for lunch.
