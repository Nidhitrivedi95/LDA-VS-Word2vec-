9ET_RUNztevq4_OLAX80Gg This review is specific Winterlicious  2017.  The atmosphere and interior design and decor was beautiful and the cocktails where great. 
I ordered Assortiment de pâté & terrine for my appetizer which was ok. But Boeuf Bourguignon was below average, heavy and not tender. My wife and I both felt upset stomach afterwards. For desert I tried Charlotte Poire & Chocolate which tasted like fridge. 
I've heard that some  well know restaurants reduce service and quality during winterlicious but didn't expect it too be this bad. But the whole point is to experience higher end restaurants for less. Otherwise you can always get mediocre food for average price. In fact I want to argue that we could have far better quality for much less, elsewhere and the only reason I didn't complain was that we where with a group of friends and didn't want to ruin the night. 
I hope the regular quality is better than what we experienced.
