VmSkQsAjUtzJeliKeGQCOQ Small but cozy bistro. Very friendly service and the food isn't half bad either. I wouldn't plan a big party table there due to space issues. And parking is so limited since it's shared with the other shops beside it. A couple dining there would be sufficient. Make sure to call before going because I think the times are incorrect on Yelp. I think they're closed on Mondays and are only open from 7 AM until 3 PM
