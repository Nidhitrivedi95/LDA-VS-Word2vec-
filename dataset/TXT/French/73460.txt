xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g Very romantic for our anniversary.  Great service at both the bar and the table.  The food was very good and while it's possible that it doesn't quite live up to the cost (and I'm not certain about this) the view more than makes up for any discrepancy.  Sometimes the total picture of a restaurant is more than just the food.

Would return again for a special meal.
