4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Probably some of the best service I've ever had - from the hostesses to the manager, and our server. We made a reservation for 1pm right on the rail of the patio for 7 people, showed up with 9 people, and they still were able to accommodate graciously. Service was formal, extremely attentive, personable, and very professional. World-class staff. 

Food was very good. I would stop just a bit short of calling it an excellent French restaurant - it's a very very good French-ish restaurant with a focus on seafood and the grill. 

Highlights
- All the food, really
- French onion soup
- Baked goat cheese
- Bone-in rib eyes were near-perfect
- Actual Caesars (not bloody marys). Being Canadian, this is almost a must when recovering from a night of booze

Lowlights (only a few)
- Wasn't blown away by the quality of the seafood on the platter
- Sauces that came with the steaks were gross looking and too oily
- I know what they're trying to do with the fries, but they end up as a bit of an oversalted oily clump
- Caesar salad was drenched in dressing, but that's what you get for ordering a caesar salad at a French restaurant

As many reviews note, the patio provides some of the best people watching in the city, as well as a great view of the Bellagio fountain show. 

One caution - men must wear sleeved shirts, a problem for one particular show-off on our team.

TL;DR version: Nearly a must-do when in Vegas for a brunch or late lunch, especially if you like to sit in the sun. I'm sure can be just as good for dinner. Most locals we spoke to say that M.A.G. is excellent, so that's reassuring. Top-quality service, great patio, and very very good food.
