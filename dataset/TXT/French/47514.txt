O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q We came here last night because we needed to eat at 4:00 pm and wanted a great steak by the Palazzo Hotel.  Most of the high end steak houses do not serve till 5:00 pm.

We walked around the hotel and bumped into this gorgeous restaurant that was OPEN!

We went in, sat down on a fab table with a view of the strip and ordered
escargot, french onion soup, lobster bisque, rib eye steak, filet mignon, rack of lamb, mushrooms, brocolli, scalloped potatos, and truffled mac and cheese.

Each item that we tried was just outfuckingstanding!!!!!!!!

French Onion soup, lobster bisque and escargot were soooo flavorful, I could of eaten those starters alone and left satisfied.

The meats were cooked to perfection and soooooooo tender and juicy.

The sides of mushrooms, potatos, mac and cheese, and brocolli with a  tangy hollandaise sauce complemented the meats like white on rice......

The service was super-excellent...........!!!!!!!

Toss in the incredible ambience and beautifully designed and furnished dining room and you have one of the finest restaurants that I have ever eaten at.
