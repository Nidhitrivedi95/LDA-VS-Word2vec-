gxMa7j1LXIUxxBoP0osDpA I was looking for a good bistro near the B&B i was staying at (Le Simone) and the reviews on this place, though only two, seemed quite good. I tried to walk in and get a table Saturday evening but it was booked up so set a reservation for Monday night. As with many places in the area of Montreal where I was staying it was BYOB but not too hard to find a Couche-Tard close by to get a few bottles of wine.

The place has a great atmosphere and the night I went it was  raining and my group was by the window. Being from Arizona I am absolutely fascinated by seeing rain so for me, a great spot, but it is a long restaurant and I am sure if asked one could get a table toward the back.

All the food my group of four ordered was delicious. One person ordered the salad with sautéed  duck gizzards and they were melt in your mouth tender. I had to try the foi gras (might have spelled that wrong which on this night was served room temperature and mixed with a bit of honey that gave it a slightly sweet texture (the other option is the more usual sautéed version).  I was on a duck roll that evening and also had the grilled duck breast that was served (correctly) quite rare and sliced thin and then fanned out. Two other people at the  table had the salmon and thought it was well done.

I liked this place enough that when I go back to Montreal I plan on a return visit. It has that classic bistro feel that makes you feel that you could just as well be in Paris as Montreal (viva la France!). I promise you, if you go, you will not be disappointed! :-)
