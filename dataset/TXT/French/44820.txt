mr4FiPaXTWlJ3qGzp4-7Yg My partner and I went to Table 17 for dinner while on a visit to Toronto, we both felt that this was a very good restaurant based on both food and service.

Our hotel was in the financial center, so we wanted to explore a different part of Toronto, and the server at another restaurant said good things about Table 17. The atmosphere there is rather romantic, with candlelight and a somewhat dark setting. It's not a very large restaurant, but the small space doesn't make it too loud.

The menu we had was prix fixe with an appetizer, entrée, and dessert. Since there were two of us, we were able to try a good portion of the menu, and we were rather impressed with what we got. My pork belly entree was very tasty and light.  My partner had the steak frites for entrée, and I while normally tend to stay away from steaks at a non-steakhouse (because you never know what you're going to get), this steak was tender, charred, and very well-executed.

The service was definitely a bright spot here. Our waitresses very friendly and indulged all are crazy questions and requests.

Overall, I would definitely recommend Table 17 for either a group dinner or romantic dinner. There's one table right by the window that was open when we arrived, and we asked to sit there but the hostess said that people reserve some tables by number because they're good. If you care, that one is ...Table 23. ;)
