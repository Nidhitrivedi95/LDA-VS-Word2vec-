1ThbwFVBL9YA2oOM11iO7g Trendy spot in the heart of the must-be-there Ossington strip, but the food is mediocre and overpriced. Avoid the steak at all costs.

The 4 of us went to Delux on a Friday night, and despite a reservation waitied for our table. The service is good and helpful, and the menu, while spares, had some interesting options.
Overall, the portion sizes are small. You get 6 chickpea frites for $5, which seemed excessive (though they are excellent). The $10 goat cheese salad was a small pile of greens, and 1 crusted puck of cheese. While tasty, it was not exactly innovative cuisine.

The real disaster was the steak frites. On their recommendation, I took it medium rare which didn't put me off. What was horrific was the texture. The meat was very lean and sinewy, and tasted more like a $3 special at No-Frills than a $21 entree. Since you only get 7 strips of pre-cut steak, it was particularly appalling.

With so many great places to eat in the city, I can't say this is worth the money.
