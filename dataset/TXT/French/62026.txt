SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ I live in San Diego, but was in Arizona for Valentine's weekend. Through local recommendations, I chose House of Tricks to take a friend for Valentine's lunch...and before I go any further, let me just say that I am SO happy we came here! 

Location--kinda random. Next to the university, and directly next to a mosque and Muslim market. (Turns out market has the world's best hazelnut baklava--go get some!) Once you get closer you can see the cute outdoor tables in the little garden area that conjure up thoughts of a Parisian outdoor cafe. Nice! 

I'll admit, one of the reasons I chose this place was for it's wine menu (glug glug.) They had a special wine of the day, which was great, and pretty reasonable at $6 per glass. 

The food is where this place really shines though...the menu is so interesting, and everything sounds amazing and incredibly fresh. We decided on a goat cheese cake appetizer, served with tapenade, basil, roasted red peppers, and crispy slices of bread--YUM! For an entree I had the grilled slightly spicy calamari, shrimp, and tuna with Israeli cous cous and spinach, and my friend had the phyllo dough wrapped orange roughy with coconut milk and veggies. Both of our dishes were delicious, and we loved the uniqueness of the flavor combinations. For dessert we ordered a bread pudding dish and a tirimisu, with two cappucinos. Our bill was about $80 but we each had 2 glasses of wine, shared an appetizer, each got an entree, and followed it with two desserts and two cappucinos. Not bad for all of that food, if we had just gotten lunch entrees I would consider it a great deal at around $12 per entree.

Service was great, and it was the perfect location for a romantic, lazy lunch on a beautiful day.  My friend was only half-joking when he suggested going back on Sunday....
