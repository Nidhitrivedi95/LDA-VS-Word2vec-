hvjgF-vnPw2jyL5DBuB0qg First time at Garde Manger last night. Sat at the Oyster bar and had a great time. Caesars with crab legs are not only visually appealing but made properly. The Poutine de Homard was delicious, though pricey. The Cote de Porc with a duck egg was amazing, the sauce which coated the plate was perfect. We also had the scallops with carrots which were seasoned and seared to perfection.They came with gnocchi which was yummy but a little tough, either to much flour or overworked. To finish the marshmallow coated brownie, brownie was rich and delicious, the marshmallow tasted great though had a little to much gelatine and set to firmly for my liking. Also had 1/2 dozen Village Bay oysters with mignonette and what I believe was a homemade chilli paste, they were fresh and all you could want from an oyster, at a good price also. 6 for $15. All in all a great meal with rich heavily seasoned food and I will most definitely go back anytime I am in Montreal (If I can get a reservation!).  2 of us shared the poutine and then the 2 main courses plus brownie dessert shared, 2 crazy Caesars and another well drink each came to $185 before tip. Pricey for homey food, but it is done very well with an informed and attentive staff, WORTH IT!
