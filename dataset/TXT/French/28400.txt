EEIz44ewHhOKmfTloAK13g gotta write a review while ALO its still fresh in my mind. came here for my annivarsary and this place is everything you'd want in a top notch fine dining restaurant. the staff is extremely attentive yet non intrusive. they drop off your gorgeous plates in a timed fashion, they are a well oiled machine. the food itself is absolutely fantastic! and get this, i was FULL at the end of the meal. i was ready to go to mcdonalds afterwards to fill up but i totally didn't have to do that. they have 4 main courses and you have 2 options to choose from each category, but i'd just recommend sharing with your partner and just alternate the dishes so you can try a bit of everything! the dessert course is also broken down into 3. and there are little courses inbetween the big ones. honestly, i was blown away i was already ready to make reservations again since i knew that they'll be booked out for months. the course itself was $95 before any drinks, tax or tips. everything was worth the price. easily one of the best experiences i've had in toronto so far.
