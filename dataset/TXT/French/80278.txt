zw4Legbcu018p5WcZ74iWA As a Montrealer born and raised, I've had my fair share of poutine. Although I shouldn't be allowed to pick favourites because all poutine is great, Patati Patata has a special place in my heart. Their poutine might possibly be the best in Montréal. They have shoe string fries and the most perfect combination of vegetables on their Patatine. The fresh veggies cut through the heaviness of an otherwise heavy meal. I'd recommend this place over and over and never regret coming here!
