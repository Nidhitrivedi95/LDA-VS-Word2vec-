gh6__q2WXFuyN8gt6VAnWw I came here after reading the amazing Yelp reviews. Truly, the reviews do not lie. The food is phenomenal.  We ordered the snails as an appetizer and they were just amazing! I have tried many times to find a place that cooks them perfectly and I did not have any luck until now.
We also ordered the Espetada Marinate. This dish is delivered in a metal pick which hangs from the side of the dish. The presentation is definitely unique and the flavors were great. We tried the Paella which had calamari, jumbo shrimp, chicken and mussels. There was a good quantity of meat. The flavor was good, however the shrimp was not clean and the some items were overcooked. Overall, it was good but I would not order it again. 
This restaurant would have received a five star rating if It was not for their long time they take to delivered their meals. We literally waited about 35 minutes to receive our main entree. Also the decor is very outdated.
So if you want a good meal and do not mind waiting for your meal, this is the place to visit.
