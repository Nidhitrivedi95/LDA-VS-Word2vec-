O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q There are a few things I expect from a nice Vegas dinner. Good food, beautiful ambiance, on point service, and high prices. The last one is not something I enjoy, but that's just how it is in Vegas. At Morel's, high prices was the only expectation of mine they met. 

Let's start with ambiance:
Nothing luxurious, fancy, or pretty about it. Boring. 

Food:
All average and pretty tasteless. Not worthy of the prices whatsoever. We were a party of 14 (3 of them being kids) and not one person liked their food. At a price tag of over $1500, that's a sucky way to start a Vegas trip. My salmon was dry and tough, the steaks undercooked and flavorless, and the sides extremely flavorless. Even the mac and cheese just tasted like pasta off the kids menu with some butter and Parmesan. 

Service:
A huge disappointment. The busboys were extremely attentive with refilling waters so there's a plus. The hostesses were straight up mean and were gossiping about us, in front of us. Um you're a restaurant not bouncers at a club. You should be pleasant. Our waiter was incredibly rude and just didn't seem to care at all. 2 seconds after I ordered my cocktail I decided I wanted wine. Annoying I know, but it was a quick change of heart. The waiter pretended to check with the bar and said they already made the drink. How do we know he pretended? We saw him!!! Not a huge deal, but lots of little things like that plus a rude attitude and it equals no beuno service. 

Overall, not recommended. Much better out there.
