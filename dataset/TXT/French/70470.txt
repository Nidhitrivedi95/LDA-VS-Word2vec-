xaqW4NkmUCGRRjmLxiFJ6Q Five star service for a take out place. Yes there are about 5 small tables you can sit at, but this place is mostly used to take out. Walked in and the person at the counter was extremely friendly, explained what the restaurants all about and how they get their produce, recommended a few things and told us to take our time with our decision. We got the philly steak and the falafel crepes, both were extremely flavourful and delicious!! We had to get the fresh sugar cane juice they offer there. Got it with lemon and mint for that Mojito taste. Overall, excellent service, excellent food. Will definitely come back!
