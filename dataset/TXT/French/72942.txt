XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q the ultimate dining experience. 

with our rezo, a limo picked us up from our hotel and brought us through the MGM Mansion entrance. CRAZY insane awesome.  

a hostess walks us through the mansion and brings us to the restaurant.  it was GORGEOUS but it kinda sorta reminded me of Z Gallery. 

We ended up getting the 4 course meal and it was PLENTY of food. for $199/pp, you can choose 1 app, 1 soup, 2 entrees, selection of cheese and 1 dessert.  but it also comes with an amuse bouche and selection of petite fours so it seems like the eating never ends!!  and not to mention the unforgettable bread cart. its like carbo-heaven on wheels. 

the staff was AMAZING and uber cool considering how fancy this place is. for our anniversary, they brought out a special dessert which wow-ed the whole room. 

we were there for about 4 hours of non-stop eating. it was a great valentines/anniversary experience but in regards to food, i thought L'atelier next door was better =\
