T4g4k2OhCTsiqcP-ZXElHQ Very much racist and rude. As soon as you walk in, this older white man sitting at the bar tells "there's no seat for you" while the restaurant has quite many seats available. I asked, "excuse me?" and he continues to respond, "there's no seat" with a nasty smile. I told how rude he was, then he started saying "I was kidding, come on." Seriously? I walked away. Be prepared to be discriminated. Certain people are not welcomed at this restaurant.
