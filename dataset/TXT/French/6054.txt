3rj1qpgFvkRWtAka17mhEQ What a disappointing visit.  We were seated immediately, drink order taken.  The drinks were delivered and we placed our order.  Our server specifically asked if I wanted my soup before the entree....I said yes please.  Next the basket of bread came and then the entree....I told the person delivering that I was supposed to get the soup first...she said oh, ok, I'll get it.  Next a manager came by to ask if everything was ok...I told her that I didn't get the soup first and she said oh, ok, I'll get it...I said no need, someone else is...and that was all she said.  So now I have the soup and my entree and have to decide which I'd prefer to eat cold.....Our server came by and we asked what happened...he said he got busy and forgot....The dining room was not packed.....so I'm not sure about all the excuses.  And I order iced tea with LOTS of ice...emphasis on LOTS.....it came with the normal amount....It will be a while before I go back to this Mimi's, if ever.
