kKC7UTcHZM3zLfT97x3msg So disappointed!  This place came highly recommended by a regular customer, so my husband and I were excited to try it.  Food was great (gnocchi, lamb).  Service was dreadful!!!!  
We were seated at a very drafty table - that likely can't be helped, but they opted to not move us, even though there were lots of empty tables available at that time.  
Husbands cocktail was served without tequila.  After about 10 minutes the bartender realized what she had done and brought a replacement over to him.  I let the waiter know that i couldn't eat onions (typically a waiter will relay that info to the kitchen, and typically a double check is done to see if its an allergy or a dislike).  Waiter obviously didn't care - served me food with onions.  Even when I said the tuna had onions he argued with me (its NOT in the tuna, its in the guacamole).  He slammed replacement food on the table.  I don't know if the waiter hates his job, is new, doesn't know the food served at the restaurant.  I heard him also being rude to the table behind me.
I was impressed as the manager read a negative review on facebook and called to understand the issue.  She told me the owner would call within a day or 2 - as they wanted to make it right.  However, no call.....
Crazy experience.   Food was good, but not worth the treatment by the waiter.
