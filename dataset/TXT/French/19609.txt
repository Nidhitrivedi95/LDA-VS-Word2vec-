aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw Have you las vegans lost your mind? How can you even call these macarons?? These are super dry and stale. I haven't had macarons like these since Koreans tried to make macarons in their cafés. I bought a box of 6 huge macarons, they looked so perfect... Until I bit into one, and it burst into a hundred small crumbs all over my jacket. Yeah.... Macarons are definitely not supposed to do that unless they are a week old.
