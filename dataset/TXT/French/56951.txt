rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A The best dining experience that I have had in a long time.  Located in a secluded part of the Venetian, you wouldn't even know that you were in a casino, with a great decor and ambiance.    The service was impeccable and the food was delicious.  We were celebrating two special occasions and the entire staff made sure to make our experience memorable.   It sure was.   I highly recommend this restaurant.  Especially if you are looking to escape the typical Vegas dining choices!
