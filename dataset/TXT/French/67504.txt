UxWH8zRYIBgs6Q2oykvRdw Decor is lovely but the food doesn't rival it, I'm afraid. We ordered small seafood tower (not a tower, but a plate) - mussels were good, but everything else (shrimp, clams, tuna) was mediocre. The Caesar was tasty- nice and light with good composition. Do NOT order the chestnut mushroom soup- it is an absolutely atrocity; never have a tasted a soup so gross and the color makes it look like a bowl of mud. Service was great, however.
