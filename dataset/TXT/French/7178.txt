4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I would only really enjoy dining here if I am seated outside in the patio. The food was just alright, nothing great. But I did enjoy the baguette and butter! It was SO good! Mon Ami Gabi is more of a place grab a bite to eat while people watching outside and enjoying the Bellagio water show. But for food alone, I don't care too much for it.
