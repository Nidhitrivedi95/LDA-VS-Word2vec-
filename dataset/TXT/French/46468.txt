nKeGPmH5dYNVL5AyAItuKg I visited chantecler on a Monday evening. It's a restaurant/cocktail bar. There's not much seating but luckily when I went there weren't too many ppl. There wasn't a lot to choose from on the menu, mostly appetizers and one main course. We had the spicy popcorn shrimp and the fancy wings as appetizers. They both were pretty good. For the main course, we had the only one available, the lettuce meal which was pork and beef. It was a big serving that was well cooked and delicious. The meat paired well with the lettuce and was cooked so tender it felt like it melted in my mouth. The cocktails were also good and strong.
