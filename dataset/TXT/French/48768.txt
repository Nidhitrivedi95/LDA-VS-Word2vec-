oJZNHz5UUVUgrZwVBVlpYw Came here for a late night snack and everything was fabulous.  We had to wait about 30 minutes, so we just grabbed a drink at one of Bellagio's numerous other bars. 

I don't remember everything we ordered, but we had the cucumber roll, the charcuterie plate, the cheese plate, and the foie terrine.  The cucumber roll was really light and delightful, and the foie terrine was just buttery heaven in my mouth. 

It's a nice place for some fancy snacks at all hours.

Service was generally pretty good, although it was hard to flag down our waitress at times.
