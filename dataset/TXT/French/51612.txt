pKiSzUlBBRNEdTML24piXA I have mixed feelings. The service was not good. The food tasted great, but I felt it was overpriced. There are no pics of this place online, because it's tiny and a little claustrophobic inside. 

I figured out that the chef and the waitress are a husband and wife team. But they are not friendly at all. She rudely said to the other waiter "They're gonna have to wait for a table then since they came LATE!" Yes, we were 15 minutes late for our 10:30 am reservation. I didn't think we'd be crucified for it. Anyway, we waited outside on the patio in the burning sun for 40 minutes waiting to be sat. 

Then they were out of the first three things we tried to order. What we finally got was tasty, and the waitress finally lightened up... rightly so, after a $60 brunch for 2, you could act like you appreciate the patronage. 

I'm intrigued by the menu, but I don't like the atmosphere enough, and I would like to be treated pleasantly when I'm paying for overpriced food which happens to be my 3rd choice on the menu. Probably won't be returning.
