Xw50tINqzrI_BM_x7_IcZA Bon appetit! This is an adorably decorated French cafe with services as friendly as your average Canadian and food as amazing as Paris.

Upon entering, you're greeted in French by waitresses with a friendly smile on their faces. The chairs are a little small and probably won't fit an average Kardashian bum and the tables are quite small as well. The restaurant is tight, but cozy and there is a constant stream of people popping in and out.

Since it was our first time, we were served a sample of minty lemonade which was very refreshing on a hot summer day. This complements the savory salmon and cream cheese crêpes I ordered perfectly.

The crêpes are freshly made, piping hot, and boast of ingredients filled to the brim with creamy cheese and salmon. The food was so well made that I wasn't even angry about not being full afterwards. 

I ordered the Nutella and banana crêpes as a dessert and again, it was out of this world. The warm Nutella and the ripe banana complements the hot and fluffy crêpe perfectly.

I am so happy with this place and very satisfy with everything from the quaint decor to the meal and the service.
