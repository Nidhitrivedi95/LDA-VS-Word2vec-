COgwFthJpS4We16W5Gf4lw It's an older restaurant with a nice vibe. Clean as well. The waiter was nice he had a few hiccups but quickly fixed them. It's not a busy place as it's off the strip and older but for sure a place to check out. It is kind of pricey but worth it the food didn't seem heavy which was nice. I would recommend the spring rack of lamb and escargot. The escargot is good if you enjoy garlic.
