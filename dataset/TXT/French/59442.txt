rw0vvALQ8cghlzoBNJ9Hlg Came here with a few non-Yelping friends who are regulars, after seeing the low ratings I initially hesitated spending my money here. However, I was pleasantly surprised. From the moment we walked in, we were greeted with smiles and assistance. We ordered a few plates so I could get a good taste of what was going on here, from an appetizer of dumplings, to spicy pork with rice and bulgogi beef with rice. 

Seemed to me like the owners were also the only two running this small restaurant, the wife taking the orders and the husband whipping up this Korean-goodness. 

I definitely enjoyed it and found it to be inexpensive for the (good) quality and portions.
