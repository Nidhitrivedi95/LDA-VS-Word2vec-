rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w for a 1 michelin star place, i thought this place would have more to offer. And for vegas standards? this is not at the top of my list.

Service was yes fantastic, my water was never empty, people always asking how my food was, almost to the point it was annoying, but, i'd rather have it then to not have people asking me how my experience is. 

Food? For a 1 michelin star place this food was forgettable. I mean nothing really comes to WOW me, the risotto was good but not the best that i had, the scallops were alright but i live in the Bay Area, nothing special. Foie Grae? I've had it all. So nothing that really wowed me. And Kobe beef? No sir this was not kobe beef and if it was it was trash... I've had kobe beef in Kobe, Tokyo, and elsewhere and this was no better or even close or up to par with Kobe beef. that was an extra $35 i think... 

Dessert? Ahhhh this is where they were saved, the creativity of the pastry/dessert Chef is only rivaled by on that i've been to based on creativity and taste that is Atelier Crenn in SF. Wowed and it tasted really good. 

Price? Expensive. But thats already known, i just wish that i got more for what we paid. 

Overall? Let's say i'd rather have eaten at Picasso for a 3rd time then to eat here for a first (for the $$ spent). But now that i've said i tried it, unless i hear they changed something about it, i don't need to come back. Unless i'm invited to come back and try. So i offer Le Cirque a challenge, come back and show me why your 1 michelin, And change my mind for me.

Tip for "O" watchers: The gf almost missed her show because they were running a bit slow. If they say 8PM is alright for the tasting menu to go to the 10PM show? Try making reservations for 7:20. 

Stars? 2.5/5 i'll round up.
