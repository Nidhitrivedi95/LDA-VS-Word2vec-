-4TMQnQJW1yd6NqGRDvAeA Having so many options for Christmas Eve dinner, we chose to go to the House, one of our favorite "Go To" date night spots.  My husband is a vegetarian, so there were many delicious side options for him.  I ordered the filet, which I have had in the past, and enjoyed very much.  Tonight, the filet preparation was just "off" to say the least.  It was tough and simply not a good cut of meat.  Our server was amazing, and she kindly returned it to the kitchen.  They sent out another filet, this time, well over cooked.  The manager, Vincent, came by to check on my meal, and I honestly let him know that my meal was "OK".  I felt awful that I couldn't honestly say it was up to the usual House standard, and Vincent insisted that they bring me another entree to make it right.  He suggested I try the swordfish, and it truly was amazing.  Vincent made our entire evening enjoyable and we were so happy with the service once again.  I understand that every restaurant can have an off night, and tonight, the entire staff at the House made our dining experience right...and we will definitely be back again.  Brunch is one of our favorites at the House!!!
