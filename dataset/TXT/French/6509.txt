4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Other than being right across the Fountains of Bellagio, I'm not quite sure what the hype is about this place. We came here for brunch during peak hour, but luckily had a reservation so ended up waiting only a few minutes. 

Our table ordered Bordelaise Steak Frites (with caramelized onion and red wine sauce); Chicken and Mushroom Crepe (with kale and brie); Seafood Crepe (with scallops, shrimp, peas and cream); Onion soup; and Eggs Benedict (with Canadian bacon and hollandaise sauce). 

The steak frites and onion soup were the best things we ordered. Steak frites came with a huge chunk of juicy steak and a side of crispy, salted fries. Onion soup was also a nice, big portion, but I can't say it stood out from other onion soups I've had. Can't speak for the chicken and mushroom crepe since I didn't get to try it, but everything else truthfully fell short of expectations. The seafood crepe not only lacked flavor, but also was too creamy and heavy for my taste. The large pieces of shrimp and scallops saved the dish, but overall, the crepe was just okay. Eggs benedict here is definitely not a stand-out dish, either. The muffin was too hard and I've definitely had better hollandaise sauce.
