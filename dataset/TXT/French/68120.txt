vg55SAkrEmuHpWfIMtJjBQ Just had a dinner party with two out of town guest speakers. All very happy w their dinners. My halibut was the best I've ever had. Moist and flavorful and surprisingly light. Cocktails were great. Fries with aioli particularly delicious and nice while waiting for dinner with drinks. All who had chicken under a skillet appeared to feel it was worth the wait. Strawberry sorbet was special. I will return. Have been twice before some time ago but this was the best dinner I've had there. Service was also very good.
