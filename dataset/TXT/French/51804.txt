pmoIMK8zGWvKsVOPDBYfzg Came here with my boyfriend for our 3 year anniversary and had a wonderful dinner! I had a coupon through Travelzoo for a 3 course dinner for 2 for $99. We had some add ons though: 2nd course and drinks. They even gave us some extras for our anniversary! Overall great dinner! Spent $300 including tip, drinks, and Travelzoo deal.
