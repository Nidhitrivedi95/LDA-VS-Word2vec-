I've had way better Macarons from Essence Bakery and Melania's Pastries and they are way more reasonable on price. I know you can't find French Macaron's in the North Valley and I'm hardly ever in Tempe. I tasted the Macarons and Cornulete (a Romanian dessert) from Melania's Pastries and they were amazing! I haven't had dinner or lunch at Scratch yet. I'll write a review if I do.
