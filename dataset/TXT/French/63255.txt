SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA Quality of the experience is compromised by incompetent front-of-the-house management.

I purchased my in-laws a gift certificate to L'Albatros for Christmas and made them a New Year's Eve reservation at the same time (for 5:30 PM). My in-laws arrived at the restaurant at 5:30 and informed the hostess that they had received a gift certificate that the restaurant was holding. The hostess insisted that the restaurant did not sell gift certificates and there was no gift certificate being held for them. 

They reported that they had a wonderful dinner, during which the manager came to their table to greet them. When he asked how everything was, they pointed out the food was excellent but their gift certificate was not at the front desk where it was supposed to be. The manager had no response, as if he did not even process the complaint but rather was engaging in rote pleasantries.

My in-laws had to pay their entire bill on New Year's Eve, despite that they charged my credit card for an amount that would cover most of the dinner only the week before (i.e. they double charged for dinner). This indicates the front-of-the-house either engages in fraudulent behavior, or are grossly incompetent.

I would recommend staying away until this restaurant works through its management issues.
