4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw After attending a concert, I had stopped into Mon Ami Gabi for a late night dinner.  I was greeted by the hostess was was promptly seated right away.  I had the option to sit on the patio, however, I decided to sit indoors.  I was seated  at a smaller table next to the window so I was fine.

Roxanne, server, had greeted me within a few minutes.  Since I've been to Mon Ami Gabi in Chicago, I know the menu and what to expect.  Roxanne did go over the menu and the specials.  For starters, I had opted for the Caesar Salad and for the main entree, I had picked The Bearnaise.

The food runner had brought the salad which was very good.  I'm not a fan of the warmed croutons.  The salad was the right size for an appetizer. BTW, the French Bread is a great touch.  

Within 10 minutes after the busser had picked up my dirty salad plate.  It was great to have a little time to rest between courses.  The food runner, then, brought the steak and frites.  The sauce is on the side, which I liked,  The steak cooked perfectly.  The frites were seasoned just right.  Roxanne would check in periodically.

Unfortunately, I did not save room for a dessert.  If you are near the Eiffel Tower, I would highly recommend this restaurant.
