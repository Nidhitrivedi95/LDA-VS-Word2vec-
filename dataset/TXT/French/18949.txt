An_U8woQkFVsMqVblkImZQ What an adorable place! I love all the decor on the ceiling :) 
Service was excellent. We came here for a Sunday brunch session.

DRINKS:
* Coffee
* Cappuccino

BISTRO EGGS BENEDICT (4/5)
(Smoked Salmon, Croissant, Hollandaise)
The hollandaise sauce was delicious - very yummy and the portions were huge! 

SEARED AHI TUNA AND BACON SANDWICH (4/5)
(Sesame Crusted Tuna, Bacon Strips, Side Salad or Fries)
The seared tuna was very fresh. I would prefer this more if they added more sauce in the sandwich, but my sis, who ordered it, preferred it without the sauce haha

CHIPOTLE SHORT RIB SANDWICH (3/5)
The meat was a little dry, which made it harder to finish up (we had so much leftovers for this one!)

VEAL CHEEK CURRY (4/5)
(Grilled Veal Cheek, Vietnamese Curry, Coconut Milk, Side Naan, House Pickle)
We all thought this was a weird choice for a brunch session but my boyfriend ended up ordering this anyways. This was actually really delicious! Good job haha. The veal cheek was very tender and juicy. The curry was just the right amount of spiciness - we asked for "regular" spicy.
