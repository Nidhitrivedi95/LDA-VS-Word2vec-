fKDyiIcFLkl-_5d4JsvBXA The fries is amazing. The steak is very good but I wouldn't say it is amazing. As a restaurant that is specialized in making steak it is lower than my expectation. (I.e. I can get a better steak with lower price somewhere else). I ordered two steaks for me and my wife and both were overcooked (medium rare but came up close to medium) .

Service wise... No service, but nothing bad as well. The servants literally just don't talk to you. They give menu, serve drinks, take order, take dishes... That's it. No extra words, no greeting, no disrespect. 

However it is a place I will go back again.
