58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw I LOVE the brunch here! I've been coming here every other weekend since moving to Montreal! The service is quick and friendly. The seating is casual, and they have a huge variety of chocolates at the front to purchase! I work nearby so I come here often to grab lunch, or a chocolate snack. The brunch is only served on weekends! I highly recommend it. I would come again and again!
