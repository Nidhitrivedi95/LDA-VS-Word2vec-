rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Ate brunch here on a Sunday around 12:30.  Service was outstanding and food was amazing.  This is the place for a high class brunch.  Yes, prices are higher than other options, but you get what you pay for.  Look forward to our next visit!  We had sticky bun, eggs Benedict, and American breakfast.
