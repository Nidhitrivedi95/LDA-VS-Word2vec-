SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA as with most reviews, i start out with the caveat of, i'm vegetarian. however, this time i really don't have to. which is kinda even more amazing since this is a french restaurant. french food is not known to be vegetarian friendly. in fact, quite the opposite.
i asked the waiter like a million questions about the menu. he was helpful and patient, as i changed my mind three times.
i wanted to try everything on the menu that was vegetarian but given that i had to stay within some sort of reasonable budget, i went for an appetizer and a side, the "french toast" and the crispy breaded cauliflower. wow they were both super tasty. the french toast, i can't even describe the flavors in my mouth. it was light and fluffy, with balsamic drizzle, mushroom ragout and buttery sauce. it just melts in your mouth. the cauliflower, cripsy and breaded is pretty self descriptive.
my friend had the mussels. she said they were good.
i really never go to these fancy places. the most i can stomach to pay for a meal is 30/person. if i were to dine as usual without regard for the prices, this would have been easily a 50/person sort of place for me. or more. i have a feeling i'll be back though, but probably on a special occasion.
