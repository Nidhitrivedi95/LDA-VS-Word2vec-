xcmmTXhuMx2fZF2Bt69F4w Point Brugge is one of those places that everyone seems to rave about, but it took me forever to get here.  My dad and I came here for dinner on a Tuesday night, and we were seated immediatly.  The restaurant is very small, and I could see the street parking being a problem at peak times.  However, none of this should deter you from going to Point Brugge.

My dad and I started off by splitting the Macaroni Gratin ($9.50) as an appetizer.  It was perfect to split as an appetizer.  The Parmesan, Gruyere, and cheddar worked well together, and I like the Cavatappi noodles so much better than regular macaroni.  This wasn't one of my favorite macaronis in the city by any stretch, but it did hit the spot.

From there, my dad and I decided to go halfsies on the Lamb Burger ($13) and Point Burger ($13) as well.  Both burgers were really delicious.  The lamb burger was topped with arugula, fire roasted tomatoes, feta, and truffle oil.  On the other hand, the Point Burger was ground chuck, braised short ribs, horseradish cheddar, arugula, and whole grain aioli.  I loved the horseradish cheddar twist, and this was one of my favorite burgers of all time.  I would recommend either of these sandwiches.

We finished our meal off with a slice of the flourless chocolate cake ($7).  I love flourless cake, and this one did not dissapoint.  The chocolate was fairly dark, and the dessert was super rich.  I could not have eaten a whole slice by myself, as it was also massive.

The atmosphere is cozy, and the wait staff was attentive.  We really enjoyed our evening here.
