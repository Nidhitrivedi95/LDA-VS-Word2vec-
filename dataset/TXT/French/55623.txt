rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A The breakfast doesn't disappoint! We came early on a Thursday morning and were promptly seated in their garden patio. It was lovely! We were right next to the fountain, and it wasn't yet hot. We ordered the American breakfast with a chocolate croissant and the Croque Madame. I normally love Bouchon's chocolate croissants from their bakery, but they served this warmed up slightly and it was divine! The croissant was flaky and perfect and the chocolate was slightly melted. Absolutely delicious! the Croque Madame was delicious! They use brioche toast for the bread -- toasted light and fluffy. I'm normally not a fan of ham, but this ham was actually pretty tasty. Also the fried egg on the top was cooked perfectly runny. Be warned, though, that this comes with a very large portion of shoe string french fries. I thought the fries were mediocre (I'm not sure if i've ever been blown away by french fries...), but the rest of the breakfast was great! The American breakfast is nothing extraordinary, but everything is executed well and a great deal for the amount of food you get, considering this is after all, Bouchon. 

Our server was also very patient with us, as we ate for a while, savoring the breakfast. Afterwards, we asked whether we could get the 4 pastry sampler to go and he said it was no problem at all! He recommended the cheese danish, the blueberry muffin and the sticky bun (the fourth of course was another chocolate croissant). Aside from the chocolate croissant, the sticky bun was my favorite!
