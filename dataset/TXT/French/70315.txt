X8lYvkI2Yv7f96cz4uE9LQ I thought Notkins would be the best meal I had in Montreal, but now I think this place tops Notkins!

Got the:
a.  smoked mussels amuse bouche - really good texture
b.  pork belly - exquisite! I think this is a must-order
c.  duck ravioli - good but personally I didn't think it was exceptional. The skin of the ravioli could be thinner
