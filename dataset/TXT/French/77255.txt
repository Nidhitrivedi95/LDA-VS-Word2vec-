YUFxSG6idHePsxOmnSHtpQ Been a long time since I reviewed this.  Been a long time since I came here.  Ever since they discontinued those killer chocolate muffins, in fact.  Those were the added inducement to get me to choose Mimi's over competing restaurants.

Supposedly this place is inspired by French cuisine.  I think that's a bit of a stretch, though they do try to create a French bistro ambiance.  Menu is sandwiches (including "French dip", so it must be French...right?), quiche (which real men don't eat ;-), pasta, pot pies, and some other stuff.

Despite my sarcasm, the food is pretty good.  If you're trying to choose between big casual chains like Chili's and Applebee's and Marie Callender's, well Mimi's should be on your radar.  It's at least as good as any of those.  Soups are good, French dip is good, burgers are good.  It's all solidly three-stars.  On this occasion I had an off-menu special item:  baked penne and meatballs.  It was nothing fancy, but I liked it.  Other folks in our party all seemed to like their choices.

If only they still had those decadent chocolate muffins...
