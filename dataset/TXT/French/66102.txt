ufwkkMd9yr9cFU1R5ONArg At first I was a little confused by the concept of a Mexican/French breakfast place but they pull it off with ease. We shared the breakfast burrito with a side of chorizo which had nice flavour but not too hot. Excellent food and really nice service and ambiance. Portions are really generous and the menu really has something for everyone. 

We live 3 blocks away and this neighbourhood is really lacking in good restaurants although that seems to be changing (e.g. Good Lake and Ember Social Lounge).It is nice to see well thought out businesses rather than Vape lounges and Money Marts.

Very good restaurant and a unique breakfast experience. Mojito wasn't bad either! Best of luck and we will be recommending to friends. Trying to convince people that TO does not end at Roncy!! Nice job.
