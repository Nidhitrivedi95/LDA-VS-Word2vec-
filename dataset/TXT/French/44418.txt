ME6D5nLlfG0xZCtICOYDuw George's is located in the flashy circle drive of Piedmont Row in Southpark.  It has a well appointed environment, with a large bar area and a separate dining area.  Since it was restaurant week I took advantage of the special menu and had a delicious mixed green salad with fried brie, pears and walnuts; a nice snapper dish and a tasty chocolate mousse.  Some of my table mates ordered a platter of oysters and they looked awesome as well.  I also sampled a dish someone else got with short rib in some kind of casserole mixture served in a cast iron skillet.  It was probably my favorite bite of the evening.  Very tasty and filling.  Prices were, as expected, high and they were busy that evening so service was slightly slow.  However, the solid food, very comfortable environment and super friendly service made our dinner at George's memorable.
