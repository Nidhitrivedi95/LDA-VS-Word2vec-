AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw Fantastic little bakery/bistro that serves fresh made crepes with your choice of fillings. Gelato, macaroons, all types of little cookies and cakes. 
They also serve breakfast and lunch sandwiches that include the croque Monsieur. 
The sit down bistro is located around the corner where you can dine in and enjoy a fuller menu of the items mentioned plus more. French favorites pepper the menu, and we tasted a few which were made with care and very tasty. 
The snack shop tends to form long lines and sometimes can be a longer wait.
