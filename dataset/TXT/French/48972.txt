OkC86YtZ0Nm19my5F4GGrQ Treated my parents yesterday evening for an early Father's day celebration.  My dad absolutely loved it!  We had great service, and extremely tasty food.  

For appetizers I had mussels, which were delicious.  My mother ordered dates and my dad tried the beet salad.  Both enjoyed their dishes.  For entrees, my mother had the duck confit.  My father ordered the sea scallops and I ordered the cod.  All of us thoroughly enjoyed our entrees.  Service was excellent - entrees were brought out AFTER we had enjoyed and completed our appetizers, which unfortunately seems to be a rare occurrence these days.  For dessert, we shared two of the flourless chocolate tortes.  Very good, and by the time we left we were stuffed!  But we enjoyed our evening.  

This was my second visit and both times I've not been disappointed.  Price point is a little higher and portions are not large, but both times the food was prepared well and service was also good.  I have only sat inside, but there is a patio and they keep the doors open.  

We have never been to France, but this restaurant reminds us of a bistro we went to on several occasions in Toronto, Canada. Now that I found Tartine Bistro, I'm missing Le Select a little less.
