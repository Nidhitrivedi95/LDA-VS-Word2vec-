zqNgwQjj0_XAll-neGikIw A friend introduced me to Merci. I had their croissants at his office. It was the real deal. Based on that alone I booked our Belgian club's holiday dinner there. Noel, the owner's wife was incredibly helpful in setting up the dinner for the group of about 23. 

The group had high praise for the food, and the desserts were especially amazing. The restaurant is charming and decorated much like the old patisseries in Europe. The chef has an eye for presentation that is reflected in how the food and desserts are presented. 

The staff was super friendly and allowed us to finish up our gathering post closing time. Merci is conveniently located in Old Town Scottsdale with ample free parking. and although in a dated strip mall, once inside you are transported to a charming cafe straight out of Paris.
