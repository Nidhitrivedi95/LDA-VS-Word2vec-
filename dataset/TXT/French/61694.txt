I felt a little bit under-dressed when we arrived, even though I was wearing an actual shirt. However despite not having a reservation, we were welcomed and swiftly guided to a table in the crowded dining room beside a couple of guys in jeans and T-shirts, so I stopped fretting and settled down to enjoy my cocktail aperitif. A delightful Margarita it was too.

The noise level from the other diners was quite loud making conversation difficult, and it was clear that our fellow diners were rather more advanced in their alcohol consumption, but we did our best to catch up with a lovely bottle of white wine from their extensive list. As I'm not all that familiar with the local wineries, I asked our waiter for a recommendation. Somewhat surprisingly he suggested an Italian white, but it did turn out to be delicious.

The starter of asparagus arrived in a very practical rectangular dish and contained some of the largest and most succulent asparagus shoots that I've ever tasted. Just yummy. 

We followed that with pan-roasted Digby scallops with Morel mushrooms, spinach purée and mashed potatoes. These again were just perfection, practically melting on the palate. Heaven.

It wasn't cheap, but the standard of food and the quality of the wine list certainly makes this place worth it for that special treat, and the period decor makes for a lovely romantic atmosphere.
