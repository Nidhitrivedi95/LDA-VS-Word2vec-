xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g My boyfriend made reservations here and I'm glad he did! This was the most romantic dinner I have ever had! We were seated by the window and were able to watch the Bellagio water show the entire night. Between meals, they gave us small, but very succulent food too. We also ordered dessert and it was a plateful of different types of chocolate! The bill was only $130 so it wasn't bad at all! Very reasonable price for a dinner for two. 

They also offer professional pictures to buy when you first step in. They have a perfect background setting inside the restaurant!
