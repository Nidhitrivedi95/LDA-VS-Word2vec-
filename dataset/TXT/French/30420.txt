FUX9h1a37GJn9ge1baiNuw I absolutely love La Baguette. From their excellent authentic French desserts to their breads, everything I have tried was superb.  If you are looking for an "American French" restaurant, you can go somewhere else. Having traveled to France, this bakery made me feel like I was back in Europe. The family that runs the business has always been friendly to me each time I visited. If you are courteous to them, they will be courteous to you! Their goat cheese quiche and macarons are my favorite items. Bring cash, or a local check to pay.
