The inside is a little light on the ingredients, but you come to a creperie like this for the French cooking not the ingredients.  The coffee was solid as well.  

The menu consists of a sweet and a regular menu.  Each meal is about $10 and ingredients can be added at $1 a pop.  I thought the meal was very good and authentic, but unless you have a craving for a true crepe and a non-filing meal, I believe there are better options out there.
