4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I have been fortunate enough to have had some of the best steaks in the world. From The New York Grill in Tokyo to Peter Lugers in New York. My fillet mignon from Mon Ami Gabi was one of the best, if not "THE" best, I've ever had. My girlfriend had the steak tartare which was also outstanding. Ambiance - 5 stars. (six stars if you can get patio seating on a nice night like we did). The service was prompt and pro. I look forward to coming here again ever time I visit Las Vegas.
