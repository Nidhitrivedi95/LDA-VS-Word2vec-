nWW6fBfBljiRFa4sG7TyxA I remember going there a while back, it was a weekday, fairly early, the place was dead and they said they couldn't seat us without reservations, we could only sit outside. So we did, they forgot about us out there, so we, in turn, forgot about them and left the restaurant. Skip to a few years later I thought I would give them another chance. Same snobby hostess, horrible overpriced menu, not worth the effort to walk in the door. The "simple salad" was bitter greens piled with bitter radishes, covered in bitter dressing~ it's a side dish and it was 8 dollars for that tiny pile of trash. The menu is one page. Just a bunch of sandwiches and overpriced meat. I am glad both my experiences were so horrible so that it is now firmly etched in my brain, " never go to the black pig ever. NEVER AGAIN! "
