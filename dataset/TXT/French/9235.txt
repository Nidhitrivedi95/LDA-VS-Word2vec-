My mother and I came here for 1 reason... to eat their steak frites. They are to die for, and like I said on my profile, they would definitely be my last meal before I died if I had any say about it. 

They first gave us some bread. It was a baguette, and it was delicious. I think I could have eaten the entire baguette if I wasn't so anxiously awaiting the steak frites. When the steak finally came, it was cooked perfectly, and the french fries were nice and crisp. I couldn't ask for anything more. The portions were pretty big, so I didn't finish, but I still had some room for dessert.

We ordered the bananas foster crepes, and excuse my French, but HOLY SHIT, they were delicious. They were definitely one of the best desserts that I've ever eaten. The crepes were extremely thin and filled with bunches of sliced bananas and this caramel sauce... if you were thinking that this couldn't get any decadent, they were topped with vanilla ice cream. I experienced pure bliss while eating these crepes, and you will too. 

So yeah, overall if you're looking for moderately priced food on the strip with a good view and an epic dessert, you should definitely try Mon Ami Gabi.
