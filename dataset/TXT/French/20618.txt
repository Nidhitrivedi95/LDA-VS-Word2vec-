AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw Went here for breakfast and was not impressed with the food for the price.  $22 omelet that comes with an extremely overdressed salad, couldn't eat it. Why would I want a salad with my breakfast you ask. Well because that's what they give you without option. 

The omelet I had tasted great and was cooked perfectly though. My wife had eggs bacon and potatoes which she commented were all very tasty, but not worth the $22 price tag. Seriously reconsider if you want breakfast. There are plenty of restaurants on the strip at the same price point that offer better breakfast options that don't include an overdressed salad as a breakfast side. 

The waitstaff was cold and not very inviting. We didn't have the same waiter once through the entire meal so it was hard to tell who was really serving us. 

Overall I would not recommend this place for breakfast. Maybe they have a better lunch and dinner experience.
