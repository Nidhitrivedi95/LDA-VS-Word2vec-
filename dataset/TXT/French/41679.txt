kKC7UTcHZM3zLfT97x3msg Solid, tasty, great presentation, and really good waiters.   Our dinner for 5 adults came with some cocktails and a bottle of wine (around $110) came to $580 including generous tip.  The wine list was limited although price and quality were excellent.  We stayed there for awhile for our business dinner, and we felt perfectly paced and attended. 

And food was good overall - but raw oysters were fresh but not as great as expected -,and the condiments I felt could be more fresh or tasty.  Vinegar for example tasted old - if there's such thing.   Appetizers were excellent.  Then the main -I had the signature pork dish - with three types of pork - two out of three pork tasted great, but the main pork loins were average at best - nothing special.  

The dessert was also underwhelming - I guess I expected something little more splash to end dinner.   And after a great selection of homemade bread to start, and the dessert ended with less umph, I left thinking it's not 5 stars even thought I desperately wanted to give him.
