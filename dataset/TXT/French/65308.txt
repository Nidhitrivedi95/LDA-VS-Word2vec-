u-SvRRAfYgpbXZRfQgcTzA What a crowded and busy place! However, it's a great restaurant to go to for sake bombs, huge pitchers of Sapporo, and Japanese tapas plates! The environment is fun and loud, so be sure to chant as loud as you can when singing along to "happy birthday" or when I say sake you say bomb!".

I would definitely come back for another round of obnoxious fun.
