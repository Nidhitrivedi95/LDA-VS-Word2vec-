lQ9VmIWvM6v-rONPkYX8aQ As the owner of an upscale restaurant I told myself I would not write reviews for other restaurants.  That being said I feel my expereince at Alex was the finest dining experience of my life.  

Every aspect of the restaurant from the service, food. and decor was nothing less then impressive.  The GM went out of his way to give us a personal tour and the Chef sent us all sorts delights above beyond what we had ordered.

I also enjoyed dining in a restaurant where I did not feel out of place by wearing a suit.  As my grandma would say "it aint cheap" but definalty a restaurant that everyone should experience.
