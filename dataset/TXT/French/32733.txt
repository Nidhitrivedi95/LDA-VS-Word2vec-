Service can be more organized. We gave our orders to a girl who got most of the things and handed them to the person manning the cash. He had to get the things the girl left out and also make our coffee. There's no tray so ask for your food to go if you're ordering many items so they'll pack it in a bag for you. 

On to the good stuff - I love how they styled the interior! The patio is gorgeous as well with fresh hydrangeas on every table. Their cups are too cute!! 

We ordered an assortment of their sweets and a croque madam. Everything was good although the canelé was a little chewy. The bread for the sandwich was delicious and my Americano was lovely! The strawberry tart was super fresh! I can't say their croissants are the best as I have had comparable ones elsewhere. 

Will have to go back to try their soups and pasta. They now have a cocktail bar too!
