YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g You made our Christmas dinner amazing!

We booked on OpenTable.com for our reservation after narrowing down Restaurants that are wallet and taste bud friendly.

The Restaurant:
+ Lit with a dim but even lighting (so I can see what I was eating), the room had a wide open classy feel to it even though some tables were quite close. 
+ Seating was either provided by plush chairs or bar like chairs at a higher table. My only complaint is with the tall chairs. You can't scoot forward. So once you pull it out to sit and find that you are a bit away from the table, it becomes very hard to scoot a metal chair with your weight across a plush carpet. So leaning awkwardly forward was not my thing...
+Decor was high end and minimal at the same time. but not too much where you are afraid to scratch the table.
+ Music, not too loud and not too soft to hear everyone's conversations. We could not hear the casino area just outside the entrance.

The Food:
+ We started with the: White Onion Soup Veloute: A creamy calm soup. Not too intense on the onion flavor but with a hint of Truffle oil with a breath taking aroma. (This was out favorite and ordered it to split between me and Significant Other).
+Next: Gyros; not listed on the menu link. Made with thick lamb and vinaigrette lettuce/olive mixture. (The lamb was cooked to perfection, not too dry or moist, and seasoned lighly without overpowering the meat).
+Black Angus Sliders: Sadly there were only three. we had to split one and wish we had more. 
+Lastly we ordered the chocolate souffle. This was our first so we can't act like experts and critique it absurdly. However we loved every bit and scrambled to grab the last bite. Served with Oreo Ice Cream to ease your tongue from too much warm souffle.

I do have a food allergy and appreciated it very much when the waitress was able to recall off the top of her head if a dish contained nuts or not.
