WOd8tWsh2Yt_osHv-ngx_w Easily one of the best brunches I have ever had. Long story short: great service, food was fast and delicious, they catered to a few minor changes in the dish, and overall absolutely worth it.

I had the classic eggs benedict with ham substituting the default cheese to goat cheese. It came out loaded with hollandaise sauce, with some fresh fruit and house fries (see posted pictures from other users). I crushed all of it, while my girlfriend only had half of her eggs bene with salmon and spinach - not because of taste, but rather it was so filling.
