mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q Came here for anniversary. 
When you make reservation specify if you want table or counter. We prefer counter to watch the chefs work their magic. 

Best iced tea in the world but pay by the glass. 
Bread was good. I like the mini croissants. 

We did menu B. Two apps, two entrees and a dessert. We added a cheese plate, coffee and I had to have a dessert to go ( I couldn't stop eating the tarts)

Between 2 people you can share different items. We got the egg pasta which I could have eaten all night long. Oysters out of this world. Sea bass carpaccio was good but not the winner. 

Entree we both got the rotisserie because we didn't want to share the famous mashed potatoes. Then we shared John Dory and the beef tenderloin. I would skip the John Dory ( I just like the mushrooms in that dish) the beef was encrusted with peppercorn. 

Dessert. Where do I begin. The strawberry was a sorbet fruity delight. It was tart and sweet and refreshing. The chocolate was not the tiara one that others had. It was the signature one with crushed Oreos and a chocolate disc with purée. Light and not too rich. Then came the tarts. I loved loved loved the tarts. I took an order to go back to the room LOL. Rich, decadent, light, fruity, and my kryptonite the simple cinnamon tart. 

Tldr: get the egg pasta and oyster for app. Get the entree with mashed potatoes. Get the tart dessert. 
Then men as all handsome and they speak French bonus.
