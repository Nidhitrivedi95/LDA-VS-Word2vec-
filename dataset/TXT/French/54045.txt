qTacF-_Iucc1Nxom_Za_5Q C'est fantastique! Such a lovely restaurant, with great staff! The restaurant itself is fairly small, although it appears that they are building a patio outside which will provide additional seating in the summer months. J'adore this little french bistro avec tout mon coeur! The impressive focal point is the large horseshoe shaped bar with marble (or maybe it's granite?) counter tops. I recommend sitting at the bar to observe the baristas and chefs in action!  The walls display large sketches of naked (and shapely) women.  The large Edison light bulbs combined with tea lights on each table provided the perfect ambiance and dining experience.  We ordered le Petite Grand Aioli (nothing special, but delicious nonetheless), the Flat Iron Steak with a parsley butter (cooked medium rare to perfection) and the Duck Confit (similar to a cassoulet).  The meal was simple yet elegant, and the glass of 2009 Bordeaux enhanced all of the flavours. For a sweet treat, we ordered les beignets au beurre salé (salted caramel). I am a big fan of salted caramel, however I recommend ordering something a little lighter if you're feeling full after your meal. Et voilà. C'est sûr, je retournerai!
