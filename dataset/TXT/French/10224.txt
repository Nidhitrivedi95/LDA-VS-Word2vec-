4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw This is a must stop for me on every Vegas trip.  I absolutely love dining al fresco with a view of the Bellagio fountains.  Keep in mind, they do not accept reservations for the patio.  We arrived around 6pm on a Monday evening and only had to wait about 10 minutes.  For dinner  we enjoyed one of their specials- off the bone short ribs, steak and frites (not the most crispy frites this time), and crème brûlée for dessert.  Services was attentive but the food didn't quite pack the punch I was hoping for this time around.
