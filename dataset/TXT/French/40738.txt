KBSCJcWGk9QNPX9MTSlM3Q We went here for brunch on the weekend.  It was delicious and I'll be going back.

I had a standard Eggs Benedict.  The eggs were poached just right.  The hollandaise sauce was quite good too.  It came on a whole wheat english muffin, which creates a different texture vs a normal English muffin.  They had a few other Eggs Benedict options that came with things like mushrooms and so on.

My companion had the frittata of the day.  I'm normally not a fan of blue cheese, but I think her dish was better than mine.  The frittata was very good.

Both dishes came with a salad and a small potato creation.

Caesars were $3.  I tried them - not bad!

The Eggs Benny was $9.50 and the Fritatta was $11.50.  Very reasonable.  They have daily meal specials as well.

The server was very nice and attentive.  Top notch service, really.

I'm not sure why more people don't come here.  It seems to be like that restaurant from Seinfeld, with a new restaurant popping up in this location every year.  Perhaps it's the shadow from the very popular Lady Marmalade next door.    I hope this place catches on.

There are some people complaining about the prices of specific menu items.  Complaining about the price of something after you ordered it when the price was clearly listed on the menu and you just didn't bother to look says more about the reviewer than the restaurant.  

They also accept credit cards here, which is a bit of a rarity for the neighbourhood.
