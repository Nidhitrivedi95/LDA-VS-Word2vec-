2gUbgbdJ7IFSbicBXlSchw Let me start by stating that I don't have a lot of experience eating or preparing french food and some of the dishes and methods of french food prep don't really appeal to me, but since we were in Montreal, we wanted to eat at a french restaurant so we made a reservation at L'express based on Yelp reviews.

We skipped appetizers as none appealed to us although they served some really good bread.  For mains, I really decided to go french and had the hanger steak with fries (sarcasm).  It was really good; not a big thick steak like in states but thin and really tender and flavorfull.  Not sure how they tenderize or prepared it but it was very good.  My wife had the homemade raviolis which on this day were meat and mushroom filled, and served with some type of beef sauce.  They were really rich and tasty.  We split a chocolate tart for desert and that was good too.

Overall we enjoyed our meal here.
