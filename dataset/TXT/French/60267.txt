SBnpT6JDbah-5l_52GM5sw A really decent meal, Sardine managed to give me my fish fix, even in the middle of a stark Wisconsin winter.
The evening started out with a fantastic Veltliner at the bar, though I was tempted by the great beer menu (Anchor Steam Ale? In Wisconsin?)
Then, onto the $35 prix fixe:
Lobster and fennel ravioli in a rich, creme fraiche-y sauce really knocked my socks off. To follow that up, sea bass en papillote (steamed in parchment paper) with greens, potatos, and herb butter. The preparation was excellent but the fish could have been a little more flavorful. Definitely not bad for Madison, but not great for the price I paid. 
Dessert was a series of sorbets, all bursting with flavor, but a little over-frozen (little ice flakes and such, as if freezer-burned).

I liked it and would definitely come back for lunch, but might hold off on coming back for dinner.
