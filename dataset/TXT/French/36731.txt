IE-FSNn9Zx9YFx3nJV4C1A Another restaurant recommendation from the hotel... we were able to walk there from our downtown location.  It's funny how small Montreal really is... 

They are right about this place.. they are not too careful with the billing.  The waitress also mischarged us for a beer we did not get.  She did apologize.. as well as for the steak she delivered to us as well done instead of medium.  The beef carpaccio was really good though.. as were the mussels.  Way better than what they serve in the States with a large quantity.

I really liked the wine that I got as well.. delicious.

Not as good as Bonaparte but not bad.

The scene is like a noisy beer hall with the look of Cheers inside.  Not totally romantic.. but nice.
