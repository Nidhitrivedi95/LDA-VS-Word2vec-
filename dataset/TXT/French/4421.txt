We stopped by after the place was recommended to us by a nice French couple we met walking down the avenue. The place isn't easily visible because the sign was literally on the GROUND (which is probably for the best because it keeps out the tourist riff raff), plus the whole menu was in French (hand-written in cursive).

We had no idea what in the world we were getting into, but our servers (I think their names were Josee and Anthony) were AWESOME. We were honest and told them we didn't know what to order so we took the adventurous route and told them to bring us anything they wanted. And wow, what awesome picks.

If you're ever in town, make it a point to add this place to one of your restaurant visits!
