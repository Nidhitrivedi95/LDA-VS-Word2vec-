SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ My husband and I love to try new restaurants, and this one had great reviews and piqued my interest.  Started out by using the SeatMe option on Yelp.   That worked great, our table was ready and waiting for us, AND I had mentioned it was our anniversary on the reservation, so our very capable server brought us complimentary sparkling wine for us to toast each other with.

We started with the wild boar appetizer for my husband and scallops for me.   Both delicious and plated beautifully.  My scallops were perfectly seared and the boar was very tasty.   We had been provided with a bread basket beforehand, which was FULL of bread.   Others have reviewed the bread negatively, but we thought It was tasty, as was the butter.   That being said, I would prefer the bread be warm rather than cold which would also make the butter easier to spread.

We both ordered wine, mine was white and was one of the local AZ choices, Provisioner, I believe, and it was crisp and lovely.  My husband asked for a suggestion from the server for a red, I can't remember which one he went with, but he was very happy with the suggestion. 

Next came our entrees.  My husband ordered lamb, which he loved.  He said it melted in his mouth.  I had  the 14 ounce pork chop which came with red potatoes and an apple mustard something or other glaze that was out of this world.   So HUGE, though, I had a  box prepared to go.   

Now on to dessert, since it was our anniversary of COURSE we had to get one to share.  We went with the apple bread pudding with caramel sauce and cinnamon whip cream which was HUGE and wonderfully creamy and delicious.   It was an amazing dessert and an anniversary to remember.  Would definitely go back!
