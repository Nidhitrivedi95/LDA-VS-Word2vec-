1 STAR= Location and Atmosphere.  Seems like an old ranch style home converted into a restaurant.  I went for my birthday, hoping for a romantic place to celebrate with my man.  What's romantic being in a little 'nook' staring at a couple staring back?

1 STAR FOOD.=  The Crudités - a basket/bucket of big raw vegetables placed in the middle of your table. I am a fruit and vegetable juicer, so I love veggies...but I needed my juice machine.  These pieces of veggies were so big and raw, it was like..do I eat this or take it home and juice for breakfast?  I did not think this added to romance...gnawing on raw cabbage and broccoli.

Bread & Butter - cold and blah. 

Grapefruit sorbet -  the "palate cleanser" served prior to the entrée. Probably the best 2 oz. part of the whole food experience.  Tasty and refreshing.  2 months have passed and I just realized I did not review this place.  Sorry to say, the food was not interesting enough to remember what we both had.  I had a Groupon for $50 worth of food..we had drinks and the tab $150!! (we are not big drinkers) 
HOW DO YOU SAY "RIP OFF"??  
 
3 STAR SERVICE=Some old stiff guy in a suit trying to be fancy in a ranch home.

I will recommend Barrymore's for romance and good food for the same price.
Pamplemousee...too many restaurants in this fine town, SKIP THIS ONE.
