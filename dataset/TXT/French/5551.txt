3jKUbhGSjFTv5jZ0wnW0xA I really loved this place! The food was great and it was very romantic!
The starters are quite filling actually so if you're not that hungry I wouldn't recommend both.
I had the escargot which was really good and I would recommend.
I also had the steak which was done to my taste.
But the best part was the panacota  (don't think I wrote that right) dessert is simply to die for! 
Really nice people at the resto as well.
