O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q I had the petite filet, as did my husband, which was good.  However, I thought the food was a bit overpriced.  If you're interested in cheese and french cuisine, it may be perfect.  If you're interested in a filet or a cut of meat, probably best to go elsewhere.

The ambiance and decor, however, was fabulous.  Beautiful view of the strip.
