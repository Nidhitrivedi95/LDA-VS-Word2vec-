or4UVDjXEEjze3wNPjoAZA We have been going to Zinc Bistro for years....went there April 23 and as always had a wonderful meal...HOWEVER...they have raised their price of a cheap cut of meat called Flat Iron Steak by $8 in just a few short weeks. Even the internet  menu (as of yesterday) still shows the price at $26.  AND...here we were in a French restaurant and they were playing Spanish music! What's with that?!?! That was a first. I have nothing against Spanish music when it's playing in a Mexican restaurant...NOT a French Bistro!! Very disappointed to say the least! I'm sure it will be awhile before we can bring ourselves to go back
