58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw i usually go for saltier/egg-y brunches but this time i tried out their sweet brkfst meal (i dont remember off the top of my head the name, but it came with plain yogurt/crepes/toast/apple sauce/fruits). it was amazing! the plain yogurt was a nice way to off-set all the sweet stuff.

surprised this place has such few reviews. no regrets. i'm from Toronto but if i ever go back to Montreal, definitely hitting up this spot again.
