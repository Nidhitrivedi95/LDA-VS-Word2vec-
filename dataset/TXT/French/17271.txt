9iy6scMRbs5ue41XRLGEkw Our children arranged for us to have dinner here for our anniversary. What a wonderful romantic dinner. The food was amazing not sure which was better the filet or the lamb but we're delicious, the French onion soup is out of this world!  We tried escargot  for the first and it was really good, the chocolate souffle,  creme Brule were fantastic  what a great way to finish up the meal. 
The service was great, the owner was there talking with everyone and making sure everything,  everyone  was having a great experience.  We will definitely go back!
