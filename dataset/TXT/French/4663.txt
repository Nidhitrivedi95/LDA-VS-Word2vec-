While I did enjoy the foie gras i thought the escargots were a bit too greasy, but then again it does say on the menu it's baked in garlic butter. 

After much deliberation, I finally agreed to be adventurous and ordered the horse tenderloin, I was glad I did. One of the best piece of steaks I've ever had. The meat was rare, tender, juicy and lean. There is a subtle difference in taste from beef and from horse meat, but after the first few bites I started to enjoy it. My date ordered a duck confit. That dish was disappointing, the dish was a soggy mess. 

For dessert we ordered a lemon tart and a vanilla creme brulee. Both desserts were disappointing. The lemon tart did not have that lemon zing to it, and the crust was mushy. The creme brulee was OK, nothing mind blowingly good. I would come back for their horse tenderloin, and maybe try other items on their menu before I write this restaurant off.
