3jKUbhGSjFTv5jZ0wnW0xA Went to this restaurant after searching Yelp and really enjoyed myself! I went with a friend to grab some dinner. We walked in on a Wednesday night around 8 or 9. The place was rather empty, but we didn't mind as we were happy to be seated quickly and have a good dinner. There was 1 guy manning the place, so he had his hands full. Needless to say, service was slow. However, the bread was DELICIOUS! My father owned an Italian bread bakery throughout my life, so I know good bread. This bread was brick-oven baked for certain and was fresh from the morning. It was delicious! We asked for a second basket! Then we ordered some drinks, which were nothing to write home about. Lastly, I got a salad with warm goat cheese, which was great if you like goat cheese! My friend got French Onion soup and a side salad, which she said were both very good. I definitely recommend this place for great French food, however the service was a bit slow and it didn't seem to be very popular.
