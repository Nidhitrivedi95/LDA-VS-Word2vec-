Since it was just 2 of us, we were able to get a table outside with no problem. I don't know if that happens all the time. But it worked out for me. 

I tried one of the day's specials. It was a cod sandwich with aioli sauce. The sandwich was great. But it was the aioli sauce that put it over the top.
