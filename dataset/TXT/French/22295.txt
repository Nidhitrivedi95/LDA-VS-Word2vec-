BSmqxPbQglQwP2R56OqOag Went there yesterday with my husband for the first time.  We were waited on and placed our order.  The menu was hard to choose from since alot of their dishes were MKT prices.  There are other North Scottsdale restaurants that are much better for the same prices that Local Bistro charges.  The waitress came with our water with no ice.  There was no bread and butter while you wait.   Another restaurant crossed off the list.
