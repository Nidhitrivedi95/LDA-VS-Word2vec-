4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I have eaten here twice, once for lunch and once for dinner. If you're going to eat here I would suggest doing so for breakfast or dinner (breakfast is always packed even though I haven't eaten it). Lunch is limited and half the menu is good and half is okay. However the dinner menu is expanded and delicious. I suggest any appetizer (they're all good) as well as the wine reduction steak. Honestly, I ate this in Feb and it is now June.... I just told my bf about this place again yesterday because we are heading back to Vegas soon and I want that damn steak wine reduction meal in my belly again. Period. All you need to know.

$$$ is worth it for dinner, not for lunch. Make a reservation because they are always packed. If you can, sit on the patio.
