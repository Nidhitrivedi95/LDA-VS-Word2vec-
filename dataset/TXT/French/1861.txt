I went with the fresh pasta with fresh razor clams. I had never had razor clams before and figured this would be the place to do so. Omg, so good. I could eat that every night. 

It seems like the menu changes frequently, but you can be confident whatever you order is going to be great. The guy next to me had the foie Gras breakfast sandwich and it looked huge and amazing. Best restaurant I've been to in Montreal and I have been coming about twice a year for three years.
