78TC3sZSYBzBsSJ0z5pyhw This was the worst most expensive dinner I have had. We went here because I had a $75 credit from a package deal so why not? Well, a couple mistakes, I order a glass of champagne, and get a bottle...including bottle price. second, my boyfriend and I both order pasta, (and really how hard is it to screw up pasta), but alas, it was so tasteless, luke warm, and chewy that we could not finish it. And 3rd, an appetizer to start the meal, prosciutto wrapped chicken, was so salty and I had nearly swallowed the salt shaker to make the saltiness go away. NEVER AGAIN.
