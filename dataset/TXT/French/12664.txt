4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw My boyfriend and I went here for breakfast... weren't extremely hungry so we asked the waitress for a dish big enough to share... and there it was grilled steak and eggs platter! The steak was perfectly cooked, so were the eggs. The hash browns were fried and crispy. We requested outside seating, the view was good but The only negative here was that the tables were so close together. We felt as we couldn't speak freely as we were pretty much to listen to the other couple conversation... Service as great also!
