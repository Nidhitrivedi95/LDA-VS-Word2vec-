8xCiibfgqy-8xpCWEaguqg Went to The Keg and what I am gonna write will seem a little strange, yes their steak was ok, it was a little cold actually. 
BUT, BUT, BUT,  their Mac & Cheese! It came to me all golden brown, crispy on the top, gooey in the middle. The truffle oil was a nice touch, making it all the better. I loved it and so did the hubby.  It was so good I didn't want to share!
So, instead of the steak, what I am looking forward too is the 6$ side order of mac & cheese.
Try it out, and tell me what you think!
