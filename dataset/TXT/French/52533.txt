q0n4I-zqiI47xispOqc1lA A good place for a casual brunch with a large group. We were able to make reservations for 9 the same morning without a hitch. The brunch special is a great deal - you get to try multiple items for much less than their combined price. The menu is really extensive, with a ton of different types of crepes, sandwiches, French toast, omelettes and more. The food was pretty good; I appreciated the fresh, seasonal fruit on the fruit platter that came with the brunch menu (as an option), and my apple and Brie-filled omelette was tasty. Coffee was also good. Someone had their small dog on a leash; they seem dog-friendly. Nothing blew me away, but it was all good enough for the price!
