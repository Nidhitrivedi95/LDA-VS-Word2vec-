el-3IdlW3bTCSnquLvH-3w My friend Vickie was visiting from Denver and I wanted to go some place new for breakfast after our 8 a.m. massage on Black Friday.  I had read about La Petite France and thought it sounded good.
It is tucked inside the Seville shopping center, so you have to park and find your way inside.  Very nice patio but it was a bit too cold to sit outside.
We ordered  the $12 breakfast which includes coffee, juice or fruit, french bread and choice of omelet (with a croissant) + small salad.  I'm not sure if it's included but we had gotten a croissant, so we each ended up with two.  I chose the ham/bacon omelet & fruit (I'll post pictures) and my friend chose the OJ with the vegetarian omelet.  They accommodated her choice of cheese and egg whites.
The only reason I'm not giving this place a 5 star is that they do not serve champagne by the glass.  If they could figure out that people enjoy a glass or two of champagne with their breakfast on weekends or days off, they would make many happy and more $$ for them.
Having traveled to France, I see why others posted about  the service.  This is a traditional French Bistro (with slow service) and authentic French servers.  So if you are willing to wait (or have to call your server vs. waiting), then I think you will definitely enjoy the food.
