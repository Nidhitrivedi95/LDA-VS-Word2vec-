TI8BCPSStuOgnqBHyTtG9Q My husband and I stayed in this hotel for 3 days. The hotel is in prime location and close to shopping and different sightseeings such as castle. Everything is in your walking distance. 

We really enjoyed our stay. The room was nice with good mini bar. Though a we had to cleaning or call for cleaning. 

The breakfast was not really good. it wasn't worth to pay money to have breakfast. 

The Spa, swimming pool and Jacuzzi was so beautiful and relaxing.

I even had a massage treatment and I really enjoyed it.
