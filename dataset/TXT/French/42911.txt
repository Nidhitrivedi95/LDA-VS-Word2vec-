LnSjzFXh1GrOObsRP6LhBQ Almost everything is good here but their service really sucks. No smiles, no greeting just robotic line movers. I don't need a song and dance but is it hard to offer customer service in the form of being friendly?

I got a sandwich and soup combo + a chocolate croissant for about $13. Everything was good but the croissant. Hardly any chocolate in there!
