jA3xcba82t8x06H8NzG4VQ Oh my yum! We came her for brunch and everyone in our group of seven loved their meal. I had the two eggs. I don't know what they do to the potatoes, but it is pure magic. I could eat a breakfast of just that. It came with three slices of bacon that were super yummy.....and this is coming from a person who isn't a big bacon eater. Service was great and would absolutely go back.
