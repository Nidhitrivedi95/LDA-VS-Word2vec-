rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A This review is for dinner at the restaurant on NYE.

First off- had an awesome, awesome server. I believe his name was Danny? He spent so much time with us analyzing the menu, giving suggestions, and checking in on us. He was great!!

Overall, we really liked the food. The truffle fries were absolutely amazing (and I always like truffle, but sometimes feel like it's not worth the price). But these were incredible. My steak frites and sides of Brussels sprouts and mushrooms were tasty, but I didn't love my dining companion's scallops. They tasted a little on the fishy side to me.

The bread to start was delicious, and I can't remember dessert for the life of me (safe to say it was fairly unmemorable I guess?)
