sARavfidmIS878q5BtlyVQ It was my first time at this place but I have heard very good things about it. It was awesome how there is only a select few of people who go into this little room where you are in front of the chefs who prepare each dish to you. I was amazed on how creative they were on making the food. It was a lot of fun and I highly recommend this place if you are a foodie and appreciate things like this.
