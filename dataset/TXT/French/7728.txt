4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Mon Ami Gabi has been a must-stop breakfast spot for us the past couple years.  I get some variant of Eggs Benedict every time as their hollandaise is excellent. The French toast and other pastries are to die for. Great way to start the day off before you run the strip. I would recommend trying to be seated on the outdoor patio or covered sun room for the best experience.
