w2tr0PA0b3tg8pId0kjM-A Coming from Vegas, I am a confection snob, and French Macarons are in my top 5 favorite things that exist on the planet earth. At Gaby Et Jules, I have tried 14 flavors so far, including earl grey, raspberry, almond, etc...

I find the price of these little treats average. While pricy when compared to similar treats, they are on-par for the pricing of a good macaron.

The flavor profiles are interesting, and most of the time quite good. If there was to be a complaint, it would be that sometimes (in certain macarons) the flavor is quite muted. This is a personal issue, and does not mean that they are not good by any means. 

As for texture & proportion: The outside "biscuit" section of the macarons have the proper texture... slightly crunchy shell... and the inside cream filling was found to be a good proportion. The filling is also smooth, light, and silky in texture. As expected, a proper macaron should somewhat melt in your mouth. 

The ambiance of the shop reminds me somewhat of previous french bakeries that I have been in, but perhaps just a bit more "pretentious" - perhaps from pride of their product. This didn't bother me at all. I rather expect it.
