cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg Service:
   * Fantastic service and upbeat, friendly staff.

Ambience:
   * I spent a week in Montreal and dined out as much as my schedule permitted.  Of all the fancy French and Italian places that I dined at, I liked the unpretentious and casual environment of this restaurant.  It was warm, open, with display of their seafood, and very energetic.

Food, Portion, and Quality:
   *  I regret not trying the pork dishes and opted for lobster and seafood.  Not able to provide too much review on food, but I would not order my dishes again.

Drinks:
   * We had beer and cocktails, made by a super cute and friendly bartender.  The drinks went well with our meal.
