j9d1c73emq6sL0v5IfrC-w Such a pleasant surprise! We arrived after randomly choosing this restaurant for the "MTL a table" event this week and the group of us were each extremely impressed. They had a huge drink selection of all price ranges, a nice atmosphere, fantastic wait staff and delectable multi-course meals. Dirty plates were not kept in our way for long, water glasses always filled, and a service check was done after each course to be sure of our satisfaction (without being annoying!) while the event is a discounted menu tasting, their normal menu seems to have very favourable prices considering the type of food you get! Needless to say, I will be back.
