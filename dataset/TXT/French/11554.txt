It's actually kind of difficult to find a nice restaurant with a patio on the strip, and this place is your answer. Great food, great prices, and PLENTY of patio seating. 

I had the scallop appetizer ($13) with 3 scallops in lemon butter sauce with melted cheese. I'll pay that price for scallops all day. Also had the french onion soup and was delicious. Other had the chicken mushroom crepe and it was a winner. The food itself is probably not worth 5 stars, but the overall experience was.
