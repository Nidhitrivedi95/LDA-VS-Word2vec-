An_U8woQkFVsMqVblkImZQ Love love this place... last week i was in the City... hopping from one restaurant to another... started at Blowfish, then Spice Route... but i couldn't find a desert that i like... i looked at my watch... and it was around 1015pm... i headed to this place... Just Desserts... i arrived around 1030pm... they were already closing, but they couldn't resist me! they knew i have to have something sweet! they were so nice, served me the amazing Dessert and also some latte! i love you guys, you made my evening!
