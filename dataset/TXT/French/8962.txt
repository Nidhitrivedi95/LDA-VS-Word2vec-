4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw One of the few places that can entice us to enter the wild and wacky world of the Las Vegas Strip.  Mon Ami Gabi is one of our favorite places for a special occasion dinner.  The food is amazing, excellent wine list and very consummate sommeliers to assist with the right choice.  Ambiance is second to none, whether inside or outside watching the fountains at Bellagio while you eat.  My personal faves are the escargot and the Roquefort steak, but oysters are always fresh and wonderful and the bread is slammin!
