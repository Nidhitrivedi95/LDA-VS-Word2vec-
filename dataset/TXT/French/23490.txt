CGKgDk1f-VAu0BHOivqmLQ We booked a celebration for 20 people.  The staff gladly met with us and we preselected items for the customized menu to suit all tastes. On the day the service was outstanding.  The atmosphere was cozy and warm with a piano player in the background.  The food - too good to describe.  The view is looking over the golf course.  A beautiful setting.  If you are looking for a European experience, this is it!  Everyone in our party commented on the food, staff, setting and restaurant as being wonderful.  Special thanks to Bronia and Martin who truly care about the customer.
Also - not French food as listed but Czech.
