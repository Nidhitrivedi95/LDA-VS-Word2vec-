O3OH5IEFMPtz7mPKakPZ3Q Japaneiro Asian fusion tonight for dinner. The happy hour is absolutely amazing. Just what a night owl like me needs from 10 -2. Everything I tried was delicious. the salmon taco with wasabi aioli is divine. I could have eaten 10 for the $1.50 price tag, will try the tuna & beef next time. Also got the Gyoza with angus beef thanks to the chef's recommendation! I heard he use to work at Nobu & he's super friendly. Last but certainly not least is the Rock Shrimp, they rock!!! Overall 10/10 experience. Will definitely be back to try everything on their happy hour. The waitress was also super cute & friendly.
