Came here tonight with two girlfriends and had a great time on their back patio. It is small with strings of lights to create a romantic ambiance. Our server was as cute as he was attentive. Tried all the items on the summerlicious menu and I highly recommend the Fried artichokes, Mushroom Gnocchi and Mussels.

The Tom Collins was also a perfect way to top off the meal. 

I'll definitely go back again!
