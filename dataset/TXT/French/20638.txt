AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw Best omelet I've ever had. Went to Payard on our last day in Vegas for breakfast and it was the best way to end the trip. Cute little bistro with a kitchen right in the center so you could smell and see your food as its being prepared. I ordered the veggie omelet that came with a side of salad and a baked tomato. The baked tomatoes are delicious! I also tried some of my friends banana nutella crepe which was pretty amazing. Everyone was happy with their orders and service was terrific. I would highly recommend a visit.
