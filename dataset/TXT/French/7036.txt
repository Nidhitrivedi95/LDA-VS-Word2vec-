4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I had one of the best steaks at Mon Ami Gabi I've ever had. The steak is a very generous portion and thinly sliced. I ordered medium and got exactly what I'd asked for.  The steak with carmelized onions in red wine sauce was TDF! The frites were a bit over salted, but still yummy.  The side spinach was heavenly and loaded with garlic.  For a party of 10, it was not difficult to get a reservation. If you are looking for a nice dinner while in Vegas, Mon Ami is a great choice. Steaks start at $24 and end at $39 for a bone-in cut.
