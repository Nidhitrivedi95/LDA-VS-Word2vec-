O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q Came here for restaurant week after checking out the menu online.  Upon arriving the decor was upscale, but not overdone.  Nothing too extravagant or flashy, which was kind of nice for a strip restaurant.  

The menu drink menu is great.  As a whiskey snob, I was happy to see all my favorites included on the menu.  Of course overpriced, but good choices nonetheless.  They also had one of the most extensive cheese lists i've seen in town.  I sadly did not partake, but oh did I want to.  

The restaurant week prix fixe menu included onion soup, a tomato/mozzarella salad, choice of halibut or new york strip, and profiteroles for dessert.  All the food was prepared perfectly, yet none of it stood out as unique in my mind.  I suppose this went along with the decor... upscale yet modest, nothing too flashy.  

Although nothing at all was wrong with my visit here, I just wasn't wowed like I have been at some other amazing vegas restaurants.  For the price, i'll be checking out some other places in town before I return here.
