Which is too bad, because Joe's is one of the good places. It's a tiny cute place filled with plants and books, that's blocks away from everything that makes St Henri an awesome neighborhood. Not a whole lot of vegan options, mind you, but the home fries are so delish, you don't see me complaining.
