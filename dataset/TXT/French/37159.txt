They need some work on the food. My side of pasta was cold. Ugh! The Veal Piccata was boring and for 24.00 I expected more than four small pieces. 

The Pesto Red Snapper was bland, lacking any pizzazz.  The pasta was lukewarm and hand churned Parmesan cheese was not offered, let alone cracked pepper.

You have a beautiful restaurant and great service. If your food would be equal you have a winner. Step it up a few notches!
