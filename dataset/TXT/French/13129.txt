4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Our dinner was extremely disappointing. The jumbo crab cake was mushy and barely cooked,  the green salad had no flavor and we had to ask for balsamic vinegar and the steak with Dijon mustard was overpriced and extremely underwhelming. It was pounded thin and hasd very little flavor. Additionally they attempted to bring our entrée while we were still eating our appetizer. We were never asked how our food was, and it was terrible. The "French style" green beans we're simply steamed and also had no flavor. My boyfriend is French and said these was nothing in the realm of French style and he was very disappointed with dinner as well which is unfortunate since it was his birthday. He said this is nothing more than lunch Bistro food in France that would cost about 15 Eurod compared to their $30  for one entree . We were surprised to see such good reviews.
