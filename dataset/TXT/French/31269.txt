gh6__q2WXFuyN8gt6VAnWw My friends and I decided to go on an impromptu visit to Las Vegas as we headed back home to Oregon. We were looking for a good late night place for dinner, and we definitely found it here! Yes, the deliver (via GrubHub), but you should absolutely go in. We were greeted by who I assume was the owner, and she just gushed about the menu, offering suggestions for us as most of us had never had Portuguese food before. We got the Calamari and Dolmades for appetizers, and the pound of shrimp and paella for entrees. And sangria all around. It was so very, very good. The owner obviously takes a lot of pride in her restaurant, and it shows in the food and the service. She was very attentive to us, as well as the other customers. There was a dance lesson going on when we arrived, which I really enjoyed watching. Everyone was laughing and having fun. Don't be fooled by the average looking outside (and the LED Sign Board that appeared to have reset itself at some point and just reads LED Sign Board). The food is great, the sangria was AMAZING. I loved it. If I am ever back through Vegas, I would love to come back!
