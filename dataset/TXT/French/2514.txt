0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g Hands down the BEST restaurant I've ever been. The combination of the view of the Bellagio fountains, the impeccable service, original Picasso paintings, and culinary perfection. 

I had the oysters, veal chop, and hazelnut joconde. It was all fantastic, especially the oysters. Our server, Robert Capucino, was friendly, informative, and a true professional. 

This is THE place to be. Class and elegance.......simply THE  BEST!!!!!
