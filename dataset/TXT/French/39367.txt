jSfnItqaOnEp2nenVF7fCg Amuse Bouche - a hidden bistro gem in the land of chain restaurants!  

Every time I visit, there is something delicious and unique on the menu.  My favorites include the always fresh tasting, perfect pate du foie with perfectly toasted crunchy crostinis.  The salade bleu is just the right portion size with yummy candied almonds. The hummus platter always satisfies and reminds me of simple hummus I've had in Israel & Jordan.  My most favorite dish, by far, has been for breakfast; nowhere have I had a benedict corned beef dish like theirs - fresh corned beef and perfectly poached eggs, amazing!  

We visited recently with several out of town visitors and a few of us ordered the scallops dish and they were grilled to perfection, everyone agreed that Amuse Bouche knows how to handle seafood - full flavor and seasoned well!  The meatloaf platter never disappoints as the meat is cooked well without losing juice or flavor - slam dunk for those who love this traditional meal.  The pork chops special was overcooked; however, after dining here many times over the years, this was the only miss in a sea of out-of-the-park hits!  So we won't hold it against them and will definitely be back! :)

The marriage of flavors is just not something you find in most area restaurants, so I recommend you try Amuse Bouche for any occasion.  Please ask for server Kim; she's polite, kind, and very attentive to basic needs, as well as, special requests. :)  Bon appetit!
