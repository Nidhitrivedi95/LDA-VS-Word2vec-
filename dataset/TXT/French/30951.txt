fyJAqmweGm8VXnpU4CWGNw Casual place with food and service of a 5 star restaurant. The frittes are absolutely delicious. They are served with a garlic aioli. My husband had the fried shrimp po'boy. I had the turkey and Brie sandwich and my daughter had the truffle burger. We all had the soup du jour which was cream of mushroom. EVERYTHING was full of flavor and incredible!!  At the end we shared the beignets!  Wow!!  We will definitely be back and this time for dinner
