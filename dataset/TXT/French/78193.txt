YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g My fiancé and I decided to come and have the mini world tour.  It was AMAZING!  The first two dishes that came out blew our socks off.  The octopus was OUT OF THIS WORLD.  If you don't like seafood...you MUST get this.  It will change your mind.  It was so flavorful, not fishy or slimy, and had a great seasoning.  Everything they brought was fantastic and it is a TON of food...so come hungry.  The drinks were spectacular and the service was even better.  Victoria, our server, was the BEST.  We LOVED HER!!!!  She made sure our dinner was spectacular and she even taught us some words in Romanian.  SO fantastic.  Also, her team Irvin and J.C.  made everything polished and smooth.  We cannot express how much we loved it.  We are DEF coming back...and Victoria...we will practice our Romanian words!  Mulumesc!!
