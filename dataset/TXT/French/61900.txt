The menu is good---options, but not so many that you are overwhelmed. In addition to their regular menu items, them have daily specials-- A Grown Up Grilled Cheese Special, a Mac and Cheese Special, Soup Special---every day!  Feeling adventurous, we tried the specials in each of these categories:  a Beef Wellington GrownUP Grilled Cheese, Bacon and Cheddar Potato Soup, and Crab Rangoon Mac and Cheese. There was nothing that disappointed.  That Beef Wellington Grilled Cheese was OUTSTANDING.  Very subtle flavors, absolutely amazing.  Crab Rangoon Mac and cheese was decadent and delicious.  Thank goodness it wasn't huge, because it was very rich. DD loved the soup. Can't wait to go again.  This place will definitely be a favorite.  The bistro is located inside Stonebridge Manor during the summer months, which is absolutely lovely.  During nicer weather, guests sit on the terrace.  Very cute.
