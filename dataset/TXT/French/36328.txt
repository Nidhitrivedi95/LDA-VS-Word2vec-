i2dnic7VdQ3NyiQQWUXHbA Take me to a place that will flood my mind with old school days and bring a whirlwind of flavours to my palate...Foiegwa.

The location and decor for this venue were perfect- cozy, alluring with the right amount of seating that does not overcrowd you with noise. The menu was simple with an array of options for the non veg or veg. I tried a creamy, smooth chicken liver paté as an opener snack.  Followed by the Beef Tartare for a starter; truffle spaghetti, clams/mussels, ratatouille- all were light and shareable main dishes; ended with an apple crumble for dessert and a mind tripping orange soda Float  that took me back to school days. 

I loved everything about this place- in my books next to Cadet. compliments to Gabrielle for the suggestions and Chefs Jeremie Falissard, Roberto Barroco & co. for your enchanting culinary skills.
