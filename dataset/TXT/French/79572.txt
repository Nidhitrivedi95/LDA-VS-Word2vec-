zqNgwQjj0_XAll-neGikIw The most unassuming restaurant in Scottsdale, delivers in the best way possible. Quaint location, small dining room and a peak a boo kitchen make for a comfortable and enjoyable dining experience. I've now experienced coffee, breakfast and dinner and nothing has disappointed. The French chef came out to see how the duck confit he prepared was serving me, and I had to admit it's one of the best I've had. Very French to its core, authentic. Highly recommended if you're trying to escape the noise of old town without leaving.
