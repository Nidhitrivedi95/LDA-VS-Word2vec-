RoGeo_pQ1TQc6Lyk4CSDgw After a few long years I decided to come back to table 51. I came here years ago when it first opened, not much has change. There is a lot more people that come here now compared to when they first started. I took the pasta of the day and I can't complain, It comes with a soup. The soup was a sweat potato cream based and it was really good. The pasta of the day was alright, the Alfredo with left over braised beef costed 21$ for the plate plus tax, not so bad I say.
