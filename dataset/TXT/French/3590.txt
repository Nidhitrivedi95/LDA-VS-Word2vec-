1ThbwFVBL9YA2oOM11iO7g Delux has been on our brunch list for a while. If I had known how amazing their brunch was, I would have made an effort to drop by sooner! 

What we tried:

Donuts ($5) - These little buttermilk donuts were coated with cinnamon sugar and had a nice crisp outside with a dense, moist interior. They also came with a side of dulce de leche Chantilly cream which paired perfectly with the donuts. A must order!

Duck Confit Picadillo Hash ($12) - with tostones and two sunny side up eggs. This dish certainly lived up to all the hype! The hash consisted of red peppers, raisins, capers, olives, chunky potatoes and of course, pieces of duck confit. The combination of the flavours went together perfectly. I particularly liked the addition of the raisins which added a nice bit of sweetness to the dish. 

Pressed Cubano Sandwich ($10) - cheese, slices of pork, ham, cornichons and grainy mustard. It pretty much looked like a grilled cheese with ham in it and the price was a little on the high side given that it didn't come with any sides, but boy did it taste amazing. A fantastic sandwich! 

A perfect brunch!
