4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Considering the location on the strip, and the fact it has a patio facing the Bellagio fountains, I am very impressed with Mon Ami Gabi mainly due to the value of what you get for what you pay. I have eaten here a few times for brunch and once for a casual dinner and it was all very reasonably priced, yet the food choices and ambiance/service could have easily made this a "nice/fancy/special" meal.

I highly recommend it whether you just want a casual brunch, or are looking to impress someone over a meal. It offers both.

I don't remember the name of our server when we ate here last Sun, but she was tall and blonde, and considering we were seated in the bar she was extremely professional (kitchen took a while to get our entrees out and she made sure we were updated, when bf disappeared to the bathroom she asked me if I wanted his salad held for him until he came back rather than it sitting out...). I appreciated this!
