rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw Was here in Mid July with my cousin on vacation, late night and we decided to stop for a bite.  After wandering down the menu, we decided on the steak and frites.  I wanted the au poivre sauce.  They were nice enough to spit the entree between us.  She also ordered the French onion soup.  Oh my WORD is all I can say about the food - Sacre Bleu!!!!  When I say délicieux- I mean DEE-LISH-SHUS!  wow, oh, WOW!!!!  The soup was spot on.  Absolutely mouth watering and exactly what you'd want from French onion soup.  Not too salty, the croutons were perfect and the cheese was just the right texture.  The steak - oh, heavens..... cooked to make you want it as a blanket so you can tuck yourself into it with the frites as little pillows you can munch on in your happy dreams.  (too much? maybe but it was just that good).  The atmosphere was very nice as well, medium lighting so you could be there with platonic friends or on a romantic date and they have great staff who are very helpful.  We had a great time, I would absolutely go back when I am in Vegas again.
