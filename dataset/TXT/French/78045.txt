YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g On our latest trip to Las Vegas, we decided to have dinner at Hubert Keller's Fleur at the Mandalay Bay.  

They have a dining area in front of the restaurant, but we opted for seating in the restaurant.  The décor and ambiance is very modern and classy.

After checking out the menu, we decided to order several small plates, a large plate and finish off with a dessert. We ordered:

- Caesar salad with parmesan lavash, truffle and anchovy.   The truffle and pieces set this apart from an ordinary Caesar.
- Ahi tuna tacos with ponzu chantilly, Serrano, and avocado cream.  Three small tacos that were so delicious.  Could have eaten a couple more on my own.  
- "in  the shower" mac n cheese, lobster and brunoise vegetable.  Delicious with good amount of lobster mixed in.
- Black angus sliders, with caramelized onions, bacon and frites.  Two juicy sliders that were very juicy and tasty.
- Guinness braised short ribs with rainbow carrots, pommee puree and coffee foam.  This had great flavors with the Guinness and coffee foam.  The ribs were a tad dry.  
- Grand Marnier soufflé with orange crème anglaise and orange-cardamom ice cream.  Wow, this was one amazing dessert.  It was delicious down to the last drop.  Had me licking my spoon.

Service was excellent.  We were talking about the wine cellar with our waiter and he even took us on a tour of the cellar after our meal.  That was cool!

Overall, a great overall meal.  With these small plates, we were able to share all these dishes.  Heck, we even shared the short rib entrée as well.
