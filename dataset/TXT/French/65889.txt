Ud5FqhVC8AdZg9RLzNW_Wg Bad Service, Anti-Family

This is the third time been there for the good food. However, the service is really bad today. The Asian staff is very friendly, but the bold hair short guy(with the creepy tattoo) was rude and not willing to serve.

There're only few customers on Saturday afternoon, but don't know why the short guy arranged our table to the back end near the smoky open kitchen and told us they don't have any chair for the baby(He seem don't welcome family with the baby to this restaurant). 

Therefore, I asked if we can move to the front of the restaurant because the table near the open kitchen is too smoky, then he said it's smoky everywhere in the restaurant and not willing to let us move. Also, as he said there're no chair for the baby but we found a highchair near the cashier. 

This bold hair short guy keep talking with friend outside the restaurant and making this restaurant unprofessional.
