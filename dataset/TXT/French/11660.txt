food is good but I wouldnt say top notch.  

we ordered a bunch of things on the menu and shared.  

a few different types of steaks - some
were more on the salty side, some more on the bland side.  one of the steak was still pretty rare on some parts when we had asked for medium.

scallops -- not too shabby

seafood platter - on the fresh side.  but nothing special in particular with sauces or anything.  

escargot -- very good.  

mushroom appetizer with creme cheese ? (forgot the name) -- very nice flavors 

our server was very friendly, offered the newly weds couple of champagne.  

i say if you go here just make sureeeee to get that patio seating for your fountain view.  end of the day i think thats what made my experience more enjoyable.
