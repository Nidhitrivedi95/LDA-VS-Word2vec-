rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A In a town that has a celebrity chef tagged in a large amount of the restaurants it's hard not to find good food. So I came in expecting great things at the price point they were aiming for I think it fell a little short in some areas but better in others.

Like most places in Vegas if you are coming in with small kids you are treated differently but that's something you get over quickly. 

Overall 3.5 
The Food: 3.25 - I was underwhelmed by the swordfish dish ordered. The fish was cooked well and the ratatouille side that it was served over was rather good. I felt though that the dish was under seasoned and nothing spectacular. The steak frites are what trended the rating up. They hit the requested cooking temperature fairy on point and the fries were abundant. The mussels I tried were also fairly mediocre but not a bad dish either.

The service: 3.5 the host was attentive but when he saw we were not interested in drinks or various appetizers he was around but not overly present. He also failed to show much interest in explaining the menu.

The location 3.75 it honestly was as beautifully decorated as the rest of the Venetian. Great amount of detail in the decor and seating.

Not a bad stop but overall wasn't wowed or inspired to make another trip out.
