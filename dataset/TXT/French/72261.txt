XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q Don't get me wrong, food was excellent - every dish had something first class to it like caviar, foie gras, gold leaf, silver leaf etc. For as much as we paid though, I wish we had just gone to Nobu...twice.

We did the $425 degustation menu, which for our (large) party was actually only a 12-course dinner and not 16 as is advertised on the website. It was definitely a very well planned meal with plates and silver ware complementing every dish. Leave no sauce or garnish untouched because they are all part of the overall flavor.

Maybe my palate isn't sophisticated enough, but past a $250 tasting menu, every additional dollar adds marginal quality to the meal.
