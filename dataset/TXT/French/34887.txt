HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw I travel to Vegas 2-3 times a year...I am always, and I mean always, disappointed with the restaurants I visit. However on my last trip I was at the cosmo placing some wagers in the sports book, I had 3 hours to kill before the games started and I found Comme ca for lunch. I fell in love. Great staff, excellent food, just all around top notch. It was so good, I went back for dinner the next night and was not disappointed. Can't wait to visit again soon.
