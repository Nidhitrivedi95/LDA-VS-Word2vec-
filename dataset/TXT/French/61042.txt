Ok so I'll make this short for now so I remember I came here, and write more when I get home...
Umm omg how do you say omg in french? I duuno but this place is amazing. Always ask the locals and people around Montreal what their favorite restaurants are....I asked and the lady gave me a list of places, but her favorite was this. 
They arent extremely expensive but it is a bit more pricey that the other crepe place down the street by saint Jacques square.
Wine, crepes and fondue = happy
