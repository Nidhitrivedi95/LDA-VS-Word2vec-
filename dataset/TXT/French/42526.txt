LHwzyN5cllTfLuZ8v2k_Bg Recently met friends here for dinner and was extremely disappointed in the service.
I would give it more stars, because the meal itself was adequate, but the two wait staff we endured throughout the evening made, even that, miserable. The servers gave every possible indication that they were way too busy to actually serve us. We waited far too long for everything from initial contact to food arrival. When asked about reasons for the poor service I got extremely rude responses from the staff. It was an evening of struggle and anger. Just what we all want for our night out with friends, n'est pas? I think not! Won't be back for several lifetimes.
