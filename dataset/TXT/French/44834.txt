mr4FiPaXTWlJ3qGzp4-7Yg Quite a great meal. Came early and even though we booked using OpenTable and it was busy, we were allowed to sit. 

Special was Foie gras and said yes before the words were out of the servers mouth. Shared tartare and it was glorious with a very large hint of moutarde, but U dug it. Shoulder of Ontario lamb was great with a hint of mint in the salsa verde. I'm not a dessert guy but the Gateau Elvis with chocolate, caramelized bananas and peanut butter was awshum. 

Nice wine list. Will return soon. 

Only thing hindering a 5-star is the fact that we had to top up our own wine a couple times.
