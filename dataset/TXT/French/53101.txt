QeFsIMcIFIJcOrpthYL8jg Went here for dinner the first night that we were in Montreal. The restaurant wasn't anything great but it was alright. The wine list was small but we found a bottle. The menu was alright - I was told that they specialized in lamp so I ordered the lamb chops but they were pretty small and not overly great. The service was also okay. At the end of the meal we were finishing our wine and the bartender brought over the check without asking if we wanted anything else - we weren't super happy about that. I wouldn't go back but if you're in the area and can't get in anywhere else it could work.
