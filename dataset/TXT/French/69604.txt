WOd8tWsh2Yt_osHv-ngx_w This place is very average. Meh would be the best descriptor. The cappuccino had bath water foam piled on top and the drink was bitter. The fresh fruit that comes with meals is edible at best.  My omelet was ok. Not horrible but nothing to write home about. There are so many good eats in Montreal, I would skip this place.
