SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ Always wanted to try this place. Was disappointed with our server. Was slightly rude. Didn't seem like he wanted to answer any questions about the menu. Seemed a little frustrated with any question we asked. Lemonade was sour and not sweet at all. Food came out quickly, however. Food also tasted great. Good size portion. Server never really checked up on us. Overall, food was really good. Service was not so good. With such high standards for this place I expected even just a slightly nicer waiter. Deal breaker for me as I can get good food somewhere else with better service.
