ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug Totally disappointing.  Go to Mon Ami Gabi on the other side of the casino floor if you want french bistro type of food.  The savory crepe I had here was dry and tasteless, while the one at Mon Ami Gabi was excellent.  Service was a bummer too.  Our waiter was inattentive and grumpy.
