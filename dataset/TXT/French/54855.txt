rBDGlL3eC4v-2HBZ4cWRVQ The food is great, especially considering the recent deal of Mtlatable event. I did enjoy their lamb shank, the vegetable soup and the pear pairing with meat is a nice bonus. The desert is also a big plus. 

Service is as nice as 2 waiters managing a full room can be. The place can get crowded and a bit loud. The tables are too close to each other. Bring your own wine is another big bonus. Overall a nice little place to enjoy some wine and good food with friends, not so much if you want a romantic evening.
