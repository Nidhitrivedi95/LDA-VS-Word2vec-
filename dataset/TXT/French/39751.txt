K2C8dSx9215LLcIzHL959Q I wish I could give zero stars. Having recently moved to the city this is the first dining experience we have had in Pitt where we left feeling very underwhelmed. Our server was good and that is about the only good thing I can say. The food on the other hand was mediocre at best given the price tag. The sturgeon was tasteless and am pretty sure has given me the worst case of the runs I have had in years. The lamb dish came out completely uncooked and raw on the inside taking the concept of farm to table to a whole different meaning. When my husband sent it back, it came back rare. I could barely watch him try to eat it without having to suppress my gag reflex. The only other thing that was decent was the chocolate mousse dessert, which was prepared with liquid nitrogen at our table. I wondered about the safety risks and thought the server seemingly pouring of the liquid on to his hand was unnecessarily gimmicky. Given that in the lab scientists use protective gear to handle nitrogen in liquid form due to the risk of frost bite and burns, I thought the downplaying of the risks associated with liquid nitrogen was an attempt to try too hard to compensate for mediocre or worse food. Trying to get us to focus on the smoke that is created from when liquid nitrogen tuns into gas, so that we could forget about how bad the previous courses were.
