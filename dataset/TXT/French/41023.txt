kcF-en40P3J9L8nLy5lKqQ Not bad! Not great, either. Seems as though CB opened strong last fall but is losing some of its lustre. I love the beer tap selection (Kronenbourg on tap, oh heavenly!), and the bottomless mimosas make an appealing brunch. The staff are very friendly and the servers are gracious and knowledgable. The bar staff can be aloof at times. It just seems as though they have a hard time managing peak hours, and good luck finding a place to wait while you bide your time for a table. I like that they have a decent raw bar variety (wish they could bring in more East Coast oysters but I understand the logistics behind that). I love the prosciutto pomme frites and wedge salad -- two of my favorite "naughty dishes." It's a place that I like, and I'll go to when it's convenient (the fact it's a neighborhood joint is somewhat convenient), but it won't be my first choice... And I know I'm either going to have a good, somewhat neutral, experience or I might be mildly annoyed at some point by either a service or preparation element.
