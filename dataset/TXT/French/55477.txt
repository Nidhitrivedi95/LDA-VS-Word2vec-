rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Join family trip to Vegas, and brother-in-law suggests we eat at Bouchon for brunch.  Heard this famous restaurant owned by one of the best chef, thus expected it could cost some fortune for such high-end dining.  We order some pastry and I order salad and the Kobe beef burger . At my first sight, it looks simple and decent. After I start eating, I find really impressed by such a simple order:
Salad - it is compact solid volume, not like the rest ever--loose, tossed; and EVERY LEAVES are tender, juicy and flavoury.  I never expect a salad can be provided with such quality. Never before.
Burger - It looks funny to me : burger with fried union ring.  When I try my first bite, the crunch fried ring induces one of the best combination when chewing and tasting this juicy burger.  It is fried to the perfect degree for you to chew on it, meanwhile, not oily at all and harmony with beef patty and tomato.  SO TASTY, and makes my mouth watering by just thinking about its flavor!
Pastry - no doubt about it: fresh and taste GREAT (not too sweet as most American pastry). ( I feel it's better than those in Bouchon retail bakery)
Most impressed, overall price is frugal (cheaper than eating at casino buffet for our group) with such a high-end dining environment.  
For sure I will come back at my next Vegas visit.
