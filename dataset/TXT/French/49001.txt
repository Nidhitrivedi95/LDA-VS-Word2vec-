OkC86YtZ0Nm19my5F4GGrQ My daughter and I had lunch here yesterday.  
This is a charming Bistro with fantastic food.
Service was great and totally enchanted by the whole experience.

I will have to get my husband here soon.  
There wine list is great.  Lunch with white burgundy can't be beat.  Soup of the day was unbelievably good.  Beet salad was perfectly prepared and almost too pretty to eat.  That didn't stop me from finishing my plate.
I never do five stars but this Bistro deserves it.
