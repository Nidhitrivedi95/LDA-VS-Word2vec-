zqNgwQjj0_XAll-neGikIw I've spent 10+ years searching for an authentic French Cafe in Phoenix. Finding MERCI was a blessing to my pallete and my desire for different ethnic foods! The Croquet Madame is superb, full of flavor and the portion is a good size. The salad dressing was creamy and even though it was a small amount, covered the large salad I received as a side, well. My friends got the lamb meatballs and Chicken linguini and both were also delicious. I can't wait to go again this week and try something new. And if you want a rich, decadent, orgasmically good dessert, but don't prefer chocolate... try the Baba Rum! It's incredible.
