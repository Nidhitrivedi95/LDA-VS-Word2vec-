YK313oIaYb8Z2NQHL1NWBQ Fourquet Fourchette is an nifty little resto inside the Palais des Congress (Convention Center) in Montreal. While the menu is largely "new French" and has some interesting twists on old classics, including cooking with Unibrou beer as a primary ingredient, the food gives off the vibe of homely, French comfort food - it feels more traditional than it is.

The same goes for the restaurant as a whole. It's located inside the uber-chic uber-green uber-moderne Convention Center, but the dining area is meant to look like a Quebec countryside cabin. There's literally bundles of wheat used as decoration. The tables are long, massive slabs of mostly unfinished wood which reinforce this concept.

The service was gracious and you can tell that the proprietors take pride in not only their restaurant, but in acting as the welcome, happy face to the many tourists and convention-goers who come visit from all over the world.

Lastly, and most importantly, this is best place to get the freshest, most perfect glass of Unibroue beers on tap (Maudite, La Fin Du Monde, et. al) outside of the actual brewery, which is in Chambly about 15 miles away. So, if you can't make it out there, go here for the beer! The Maudite I had here was about 30 times better than the Maudite I'm able to procure in San Francisco. Don't ask me why...
