Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA Awesome place to come for a drink and enjoy the magnificent view, but I can't recommend trying to make a night out here. We got to the lounge around 9:30 on a Friday night and there awesomely was no cover (and no cover for our husbands who got there around 11) and lots of seating with a view available. The view is awesome, with a wonderful panorama of the strip. The cocktail menu was ok but the drinks were a little too sweet. I couldn't stomach more than one and switched to beer. If you're seated away from the dance floor, the volume of music is not too loud which is great for being able to have a conversation. I just didn't love the mix of music. I think it's probably for people younger than me (and I'm under 30) based on the (few) people out on the dance floor. I did go up to the DJ to request some other music, and he said the establishment frowns upon playing hip hop music...but he did oblige us with some Biggie, 50 cent, and Dr Dre. As soon as he stopped playing that short little set it went back to Techno/Dance (I think? I don't even know how to classify the music), and we jetted out of there to catch the last 12:30 tram. If the music had been more my tune I would have loved to dance on top of Vegas all night.
