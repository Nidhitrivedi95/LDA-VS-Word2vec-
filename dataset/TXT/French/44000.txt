MdjIl105vqCYUGKFSUVytA You'd expect a restaurant owned by the Chase group (as in Chase fish and oyster) to nail ... you, know, fish. 

I think it's a case of style over substance. Sure they've spent a fortune on the decor - and that always makes me a bit nervous. I ordered the beef tartare and the halibut. The tartare was like raw beef ... and that's all. It was devoid of flavour. (Chantecler still rules in Toronto for tartare.)

And now the big disappointment: the halibut. It has so overcooked, it was completely dried out. Are you kidding me? Thank goodness for the creamy sauce below ... welcome moisture. 

My husband had the beef bourguignon and from the teeny tiny portion, he found it quite tasty, as was the bag of chips he devoured when we got home.

Sorry, but to me, food rules over million dollar decor. There are some great restaurants turning out amazing food in TO (for a lot less $$).
