It is a less is more attitude on the decor and it works for the intended setting.  There is a viewing case of the offered pastries of the day and that is where you will find most people bobbing their heads in excitement of their anticipated treats.

Upon the initial review of the menu, I was happy to see such a strong price point in a specialty cafe.   Having your entire breakfast repertoire being priced below ten dollars almost made me want to try a few different breakfast ideas.  After a brisk review, I decided on the breakfast sandwich and an iced latte, while my companion chose the eggs benedict and a cappuccino.  

I could see the chef via the semi open kitchen, working furiously to move the orders up to the window for delivery.  Upon arrival, I was pleasantly surprised by a fluffy croissant filled with a perfectly cooked egg and ham stuffing.  The sandwich, while not huge in size, most certainly delivered.  The accompany spinach salad had side container of goat cheese, which made the entire dish perfectly pulled together.  

My companions eggs benedict turned out to be just one minaret of egg, ham, perfectly toasted english muffin and silky hollandaise sauce, rather than two.  The hash browns were home made, textured and tasty, making it a great accompaniment.  It should be noted that the heavy majority of restaurants serving eggs benedict consider two eggs the standard, rather than one, so be prepared you might want more.

Both of our coffee beverages were made with care and tasted great.  

I would recommend this establishment to anyone looking for solid food at a great price point in a comfortable atmosphere.  Further review coming after I visit again to try out their dinner ideas.
