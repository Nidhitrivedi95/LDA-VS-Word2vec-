HOev_2CifUcfIm9xDL_uaw Incredible onion soup and butter croissants! I don't know about you but that's enough to get me in the door.  This is a tiny restaurant with plastic tablecloths in a strip mall in an industrial park - and it is nearly perfect!

We always see families speaking French to the wife that works the front of the house and I understand why, there may be slight adjustments for the American palate/ingredients but I've eaten at this type of place a dozen times in France.  Service is as fast as they can do it so head to the nearest drive thru if you are in a rush.  

Croque Monsieur is outrageous, chef panini is excellent, goat cheese panini is excellent, quiche is delicious, the French taboule is delicate, the fries are as good as you'd expect at a French Bistro and I've already mentioned the soup and croissants.  

A wonderful little place, the exact type of small business we should be supporting.
