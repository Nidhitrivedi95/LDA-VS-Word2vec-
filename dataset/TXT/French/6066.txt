It is a bit crowded so calling ahead to make reservations would be suggested to guarantee your place. I started with a " Calmar frit avec mayonnaise chipotle " for entrees and took the "Poulet au lait de noix de coco" as the main course. There's many different options to choose from (Entrees, salads, pasta, burgers, chicken, different types of fish). The service was good and we we're pleased with our plates. On the other hand, It's a bit on the pricey side and the portions are not that big. Overall, It's a good place to try if you're in Brossard but it's not the best. During the summer, the terasse should be open
