4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I absolutely loved this restaurant. The service was great, the location was perfect, and the food was excellent.  My guy and I both decided to go for breakfast one of the mornings we vacationed there in Vegas.  We both got the Belgian waffles - different versions, his with blueberries and mine with mixed berries.  Absolutely delicious!  I also got a side of chicken sausage which was also very delicious and had a nice spicy taste to it.  Wait service was also on point and our waitress was very quick and timely with our orders.  We hardly had to wait a moment and our food was out.  The view is also great.  We sat outside which had an excellent view of the Bellagio water fountain.  I can't tell you how beautiful it is to watch the fountain show while feasting on some waffles.  Great times.  If you are worried about the heat from eating outside (we went in August), not to worry.  There are fans with mists to keep you cool.  It was 100 degree weather and it still felt absolutely pleasant sitting there.  I would suggest to anyone to try there when in Vegas, especially for breakfast.
