BSmqxPbQglQwP2R56OqOag We have been twice. Both times the food has been excellent and tasty, with fresh ingredients. I have had seafood both times and been very pleased with the quality and preparation. (cioppino is very good) Reasonably friendly staff with decent service. My only complaint was that the waitress this last time really had no knowledge of the wine list and that was really a bummer.
