4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I think this may be one of the only restaurants on the strip that we went to that didn't feel like a strip restaurant (unless you sat outside in front of the fountains).  The service was prompt and the food was cooked to perfection.  My steak au poivre wasn't prepared how I am used to seeing this dish, but it was fantastic nonetheless.  Quality food and reasonable prices.
