4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I recently celebrated a friend's Birthday at Mon Ami, which happens to be one of my favorite restaurants. Aside from the amazing food my favorite part about the restaurant is the atmosphere. I love sitting outside because you can see the Bellagio fountains across the street, however it was a chilly night so we sat inside. I ordered the escargot for an appetizer and the salmon for and entree; both were delicious. I highly recommend dining at Mon Ami if you want quality french food, great service, and a relaxing dining experience.
