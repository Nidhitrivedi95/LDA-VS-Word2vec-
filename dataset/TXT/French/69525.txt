WOd8tWsh2Yt_osHv-ngx_w Smoked salmon Benedict and a side of strawberry chocolate hazelnut crepe. Delicious Chamomile tisane. For my 3 year old A kids pancake and chocolate milk. Fabulous meal and lovely service. They even let me park my big stroller next to the table so I didn't wake my sleeping 5 month old.
