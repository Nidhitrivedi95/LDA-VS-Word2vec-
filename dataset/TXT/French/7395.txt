4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw The Good:
-Quick seating, but still do yourself a favor and make a reservation. 
-Affordable pricing (for Vegas)
-Good Fries 
-Decent selection of champagne by the glass (Nice to find a place that doesn't push me to become a lush and buy the whole bottle)
-Cute digs
-Nice serving staff
-Nice view of the water show at the Bellagio


The Developmental Needs:
-Medium-well steak (tried 3 different ways) felt a bit rubbery the first and second time we visited
-Flavor in the food leaves a lot to be desired. Even the desserts didn't win me over. This made me sad. 


I'm not a huge fan but due to convenience and consistency with what they could execute well we went back twice. Definitely go and see what works for you. The location is great and perhaps there were just gems on the menu that we weren't able to try.
