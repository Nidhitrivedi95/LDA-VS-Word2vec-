Tiny place, 2 overwhelmed staff, small menu. One kind of beer.

The servings of burgers and fries are remarkably reasonable and you could even say health conscious.  Very small burgers and the fries are accompanied by a salad.  Its not that bad if you don't want it to be. 

I really love their hot dog

I have waiting a very long time here but when you see those people working their asses off you don't mind. 

Go on off times.  You will get pretty cramped otherwise and its a bad experienced to be crushed in line.

Again I love this place its got everything going for it.
