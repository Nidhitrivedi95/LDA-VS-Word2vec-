DwJlGxAJvohbDR_5jV-ERA Came for drinks tonight. It was pretty dead everywhere but there were a few people on the patio so we thought it would be alright. We just had drinks since it was very late. I inquired about getting an old fashioned but the waitress wasn't sure if they had bourbon... She came back and told us they had Jack Daniels... 

Since the menu was clearly very beer oriented we got a couple beers. We ordered a couple German beers which seemed fine. Halfway through we realized they were non alcoholic so we called the waitress over and told her about the mistake. She seemed quite apologetic and brought us new ones (with alcohol). However, she told us since we had finished over half of both bottles that we would be charged for one. At this point I wasn't really in the mood to argue with her so we just went along with it.

Long story short, service was average but the way they dealt with the wrong order was just dumb. We didn't know it was non alcoholic until we were mostly through and typically we aren't expecting to have to read the bottle to check if what we got is correct. Definitely would not come back. Food menu looked fine but there are way better places in the area.
