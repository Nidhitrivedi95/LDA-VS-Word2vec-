9L8UgjIvLfwylrFacB2HuA Cafe Holt is situated on the lower level of Holt Renfrew.  Came here for a late/light lunch with a friend.  The space is very white and modern looking with a small bar.

As it was my first meal of the day I was hungry and got a starter and a main dish.  As a starter I chose the lobster and crab ravioli.  Portion size was great (about 5 raviolis) and it was very tasty.  My main dish was the taleggio grilled cheese.  It was good, but I found it to be a little too small for the price, since nothing was accompanying it as well (unless you count sprigs of alfalfa sprouts an accompaniment).  It is a tad expensive, but its of good quality and offers a variety of choices to suit all kinds of tastes.

They also have a decent wine selection.

The service was acceptable and efficient.  (I have sat at both the bar and a table before).

In all, Cafe Holt offers a nice refreshing fresh tasting lunch when its getting harder to come by in the downtown area.
