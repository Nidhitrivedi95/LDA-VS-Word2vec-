pmoIMK8zGWvKsVOPDBYfzg I'm a foodie, and I've been to many of the high-end restaurants in Vegas, especially the Michelin-rated ones. I was eager to try Andre's after reading the reviews, but it just wasn't all I hoped it would be.

The service was good. The server was friendly. However, when I told him I didn't like my cocktail, he said "well, now you know you don't like it for next time."  He could have at least pretended that he cared.  Btw, it was the foie gras martini, which I thought I would love since I love foie gras, but like many items in this restaurant, it was too sweet.  The accompaniments they bring with the martini are fun though (caramelized pears, berries, banana ice cream). 

I ordered the lobster bisque, the seared foie gras, the scallops, and the rack of lamb. The lobster bisque was pretty good but I could have done without the corn infusion. The seared foie was cooked perfectly, but I agree with another reviewer that it was overpowered by the sweet sauce drenched on the plate. The scallops were very good and cooked perfectly. Probably one of my highlights. The lamb was also cooked very well, but again I didn't like the particular sauce they used, so I had to move the lamb onto another plate.  I probably seemed very "high-maintenance" to the server, but I never ever have a complaint or accommodation at the other Michelins I've been to b/c things are usually prepared to perfection. Here, not as much. However, if you like your dishes sweet, this might be the place for you.

All in all, the food was decent, but not as good as many of the other places I've enjoyed in Vegas. I would recommend Picasso or Le Cirque or L'Atelier or Joel Robuchon over Andre's.
