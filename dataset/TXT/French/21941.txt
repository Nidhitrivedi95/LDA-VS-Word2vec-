BpTijSZy7-2SZskFSCVW2g Came here for brunch on a Saturday morning and were seated right away. The restaurant is fairly small but cozy, seating about 20 people. 

We ordered: 
- Eggs "bunny": two eggs baked inside cute little brioche buns with a salad on the side. The eggs were baked perfectly and they were delicious! 
- French toast: two large pieces of toast with whipped cream and maple syrup. The toast was light and fluffy, and it tasted good but nothing in particular to rave about. 

Something to keep in mind - the portions are fairly small and it's reflected in the prices (at least for the items we ordered). If you're really hungry, I would recommend you to add a side (i.e. smoked salmon or bacon). We tried to order soup but they didn't have it that day apparently. 

I would come back to give the other menu items a try if we're in the area.
