rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A This review is for breakfast at Bouchon, which is the only meal I've had there.  My go-to is their $23 breakfast, which comes with eggs, bacon, sausage, potato croquettes, toast, your choice of pastry, juice, and coffee.  So worth every penny - it is delicious and filling!  The last time I went, I chose their strawberry croissant for my pastry.  Just one word to describe it: WOW!  So very tasty :)  On my last visit, I also got their yogurt parfait, which came with berries and granola.  I really, really liked it.  To top it off, service here is top-notch.  

I was going back and forth between 4 stars and 5 stars.  I decided on 4 because although the food and service are top notch, I like when the ambiance is either cozy or luxe, and it's neither here, but rather has a bit of a casual feel for the type of restaurant it is.

FYI, the restaurant is in the Venezia tower, and there are separate elevators in the Venetian lobby near registration that you can take to get there.  Once you get off the elevators, it's a nice walk down a really nice corridor to the restaurant.  There is also another way to get there from the Venetian parking garage, if I recall correctly.  In the past I've had to wait for a table, but I went at opening on a weekday on my last visit, and there was no wait whatsoever.

Not sure what dinner is like, but I can definitely recommend Bouchon for your breakfast needs :)
