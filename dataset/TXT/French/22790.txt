bzbNGyrTwWHAgg1CqkSgeg The service here was wonderful! I got the most simple thing every and wish I had tried something more worth giving critique on, like their chicken. I will try it again before basing my overall opinion on the food. My family however loved their food. My husband got the steak and eggs and my daughter got scrambled eggs and bacon. I got a red velvet waffle that my son's devoured for me I ended up ordering another so I could try it. My son is picky so The fact that he ate it so fast had me curious and it was worth it ! Looooved that dang waffle! Again the service was perfect and our waitress Savanah was so cute and great!!
