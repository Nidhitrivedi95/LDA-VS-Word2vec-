Fd25lEnclIwyWlSRgkbRfg Finally, decent french fare in Pittsburgh!!!  

Sitting outside on the patio eating dinner while enjoying a beautiful view of Pittsburgh's skyline was only one of the things that made my experience here fantastic.
The new renovated location that is right off the 10th street bridge in the Southside, is beautifully well done.  The food is fanatstic. Get the truffle fries because they come with actual chunks of black truffles on them! The oysters were fresh, and the mussels had an excellent sauce.  I was very impressed with not only the menu and the service, but with the wine and cocktail list.  It is not everyday you see a Negroni featured.  I wanted to try all of their cocktails, but opted for wine instead.  The prices are affordable ranging anywhere from 26-60 a bottle.  Dave the owner takes special care in selecting which wines go on the menu.  He explained alot of them to us, and the ones that we recieved were all amazing for the price.  

I am looking forward to the expanding menu that they are going to start providing, but in the meantime, go here and enjoy a true taste of France.
