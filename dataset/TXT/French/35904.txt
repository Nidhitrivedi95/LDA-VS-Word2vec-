hvjgF-vnPw2jyL5DBuB0qg I love you, Chuck Hughes.

You know the way to my heart:  Lobster Poutine.

Garde Manger is absolutely my favourite restaurant in Montreal, and it is not just because I'm a bit of a celebrity chef groupie. The restaurant has a great  vibe - it feels warm and cozy, the perfect place to curl up for some comfort food, yet the eclectic music and vibrant clientele make you want to get up and party.

What can I say about the food? I've already mentioned my love for the lobster poutine. The scallops were meaty, flavourful and surprisingly filling. Though I was stuffed from all the food and wine, I couldn't resist the deep fried Mars bar with ice cream for dessert - yum.

My only complaint: it was really, truly, Chuck's day off.
