Dcj69NZJnbJhK-YHP_nULA Monroe Street is Madison's answer to Williamsburg, and cunningly Brasserie V is making a name for itself among the local, slightly off-brand of bearded, skinny-jean-donning hipsters. My  companion and I arrived on a late, slushy afternoon for a meal, she trying the shitake sandwich and I, the V Burger. My frites came with just-ok aioli mayo; ketchup arrived only after a request. Both meals were excellent, with fresh and proportionate portions, although my burger arrived a bit underdone. Our servista was cheerful and attentive. Cost came to about $30 (no drinks). 

In the minus column, the tables were too closely packed, causing unnecessary collisions with group of four cologne-emitting gentlemen behind us. While our waitperson was excellent,  the chatter among other staff members was distracting and unprofessional. 

The atmosphere is warm and well-lit. 

Our judgment: we'll definitely return.
