4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw My husband and I first came upon Mon Ami Gabi on a trip to Vegas back in 2000. We had just gone up the Eiffel Tower and when we came down we were hungry. It was pretty late so rather than wander the strip aimlessly looking for something to eat, we decided to head into Mon Ami Gabi and give it a try. We were so glad we did because it was one of the best meals we had on that trip. Every year we go to Vegas, every time we're there we eat at Mon Ami Gabi at least once. The steaks are perfect, the service is good and the atmosphere is wonderful. I only remember one time where one of the people in our party didn't care for their steak, they didn't realize that a hangar steak is a very tough cut. The server took note that the steak was hardly touched and when they found out they reason why they promptly removed the steak, asked what else we would like and made the substitution. The steak was comped and the subtituted item was not added to the bill. That's service! I also love Mon Ami Gabi's cocktails, in particular their Espresso Martini, so good!  All in all this is a great place that we go to again and again, wouldn't be a trip to Vegas without a stop at Mon Ami Gabi. I think we'll try the breakfast next time we go.
