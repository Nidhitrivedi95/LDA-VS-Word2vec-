My wife and I eat out a lot, but rarely at a place of this caliber.  The food is very expensive - our bill with a few drinks was ~$500 for two - but the quality, creativity and service is worth it.
The staff was extremely attentive and classy without being pretentious or judgmental of bumpkins like us.
I would spend the money again.
