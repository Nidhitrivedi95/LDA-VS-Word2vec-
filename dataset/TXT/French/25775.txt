Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA Came for our last night in Vegas for a romantic meal. The view (and decor) was absolutely incredible and hands down worth coming for at least a round of drinks in the lounge. However, we weren't too satisfied with the restaurant experience. The waiter we had was snooty (perhaps assuming young clientele = cheap tippers?) and talked down to us. We tried to get past it, but it left a lasting impression on us. Despite the service, we had a pretty good meal. We ordered the lobster Caesar salad and gnocchi, both were fairly good. For my entree, I got the Wagyu beef, which came as a pot roast and wasn't what I was expecting for a fine dining meal. Husband got the curry lobster dish, which was very good. We capped it off with a bottle of wine in the lounge and views overlooking the strip at night. Bottom line, come for drinks, but skip the food.
