SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ After I wrote my first review, the owner of the restaurant contacted me and offered his deepest apologies. It was honestly probably the most heartfelt apologies I had ever received. He offered to send us a gift card to fix our last visit. I accepted. We dined again at House of Tricks on Monday night to celebrate our engagement (perfect timing, right?). This time was so much better. We were seated outside, tended to, checked up on in a timely manner. Our server was so courteous. It definitely made up for first time. We sat and enjoyed our meal, the conversation, and the atmosphere for over an hour. I am incredibly grateful to see that the owner of this place listens to the customers. The meal was perfect, the service was perfect. I am retracting my first review. The owner took the criticism and constructively solved it.
