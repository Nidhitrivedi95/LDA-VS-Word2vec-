rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Very good service and good food.  I got the  beef spare rib and my date got the steak which was a lot better. The fries were very good and the lightly deep fried cod balls were very good. I need to go again and hopefully give it 5 stars, just because it was not the best meal ever and I really wanted it to be. The price is high but, that is expected and should not be a negative.
