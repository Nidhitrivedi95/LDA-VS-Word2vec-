QeFsIMcIFIJcOrpthYL8jg My husband and I just arrived in Montreal after traveling all day and happened up Modavie.  We got there very early in the evening, around 5:30 and were able to get the best seat in the house next to a window looking down one of the quaint Old Montreal streets.  Our service was excellent.  The food was delicious.  We ordered Calamari for an appetizer that was one of the best we have ever eaten..  I had the trout almandine and my usband had the short ribs.  They both were outstanding.  The atmosphere was so relaxing and background music very nice.  I think we may just have to go back and listen to some jazz, since we got there too early for that the first time.  A definite must in old Montreal!!
