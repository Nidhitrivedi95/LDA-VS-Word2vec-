4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I am shocked at all the positive reviews, because my experience was pretty mediocre. My husband, toddler, and I grabbed an early dinner here last night. Lots of reviews say this place is kid friendly, but I guess that doesn't translate to "toddler friendly." Should have known! We asked if they could get us a high chair if they had one, and the hostess just laughed at us. My bad.

I had the steak frites with Bearnaise. I ordered it medium, but it came out well done. The steak was super fatty and gristly. The sauce was pretty bland. The fries weren't bad though.

My husband had the steak frites, classique style. His steak was cooked medium as requested, but also pretty bland and under seasoned. His was at least edible though, and not fatty like mine was.

The good: Our server was attentive and friendly. My husband has Celiac disease, and they have a small gluten free menu. They brought out some GF bread for him, and made sure to keep it separate from the regular bread. Both the bread and his entree came out with a little "allergy" toothpick in them and they seemed knowledgeable about eating GF. He also didn't get sick, so no cross contamination there! 

The verdict: It's overpriced for what you get. If you need a GF option I think it's worth checking out, but otherwise I'd skip it.
