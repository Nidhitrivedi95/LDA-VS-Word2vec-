aervNtqzrKf0CGrFo4xfKw Food and service were excellent. I highly recommend!!  We were a large group for a friend's birthday last night and they handled it very well.  We were a bit of a pain and wanted split bills and we had people coming and going but they were very patient with us. I ate the steak tartare and the pastèque salad and both were delicious. The ambience inside the restaurant and on their patio was perfect!  Great place for a romantic dinner as well. Thank you for a great night!
