c8j5MQqlb0RhgS_bpxMDuA Restaurant was recommended by the concierge at Intercontinental (Gerry) after a long work day. 

We had both risottos (duck and scallop) as well as the salmon tartar. All dishes were delicious! Dessert was a chocolate, salted caramel plate of amazing! 

Impeccable service, great food, great atmosphere. 

Will definitely be back and can't wait to enjoy the beautiful terrasse in the summer.
