The wait was a breeze and we were quickly seated in the outdoor patio.  If you dine here I highly recommend eating on the patio, it's a great place for people watching and if your lucky a great view of the Bellagio fountain show.  The menu ranged from waffles to omelettes to eggs Benedict.  I ordered the smoked salmon platter and the others in my party had the smoked salmon eggs Benedict.  The hollandaise sauce was on point.  Food was delicious and service was friendly.  Price was also reasonable, for four people the bill came out to $89.  I'm really glad I had a chance to try this well known vegas establishment.
