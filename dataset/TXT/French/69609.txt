WOd8tWsh2Yt_osHv-ngx_w This is a great resteraunt right next to the Omni Hotel.  I went here several times and placed to-go orders.  The food is absolutely delicious, fair to moderately priced (for Canada), and the waiters and waitresses were very polite.  Definitely a favorite of mine in Montreal!
