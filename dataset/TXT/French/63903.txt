T4shscbr3BU3yb6EA3BSfA Let me tell you of the time I fell in love with Montreal. Part 3: Dessert
Planning with my friends for our dream budget Canadian holiday, we looked up dessert bars and stumbled upon Les400Coups' THREE COURSE DESSERT MENU ($18).

The summer evening my two friends and I came in, the host sat us at the open bar because there would be a half hour wait for tables. When the bar tender waited on us, at first we all thought he would judge us as being cheap Americans looking for a small meal... "who goes to a restaurant just to get dessert??" But nope, he was friendly and attentive! He described the flow of the three courses - appetizer dessert, main dessert and finale dessert!

We select our three choices and with each course, a server would describe our plates of table spoon size ice cream and other small bits. We take turns scooping up a teaspoon of ice cream and their tiny toppings, among the three of us and.... POW. Big bursts of flavor in a tiny package! Figuring out each flavor felt like being a judge on Top Chef!

Amidst our main dessert, the bartender also kindly informed us that the fruit on our plate amounted to 8 servings worth of vitamin C found in orange juice! I'm going back to Montreal just so I can experience more of their flavors and also build my immune system!
