grHISDkIGwttYthhW8DxCQ This review is for the savory crêpes. The ham and cheese was not that great really. Nothing special to be honest. It's on the more expensive side. I love crêpes so I always try them everywhere I go and I was disappointed when I left the place.I feel like for the quality they are too expensive and I wouldn't go back again. I guess I'll never experience the same crêpes I had when I was in Paris. Such a shame. I suppose the sweet crêpes might taste better.
