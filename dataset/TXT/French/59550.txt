s-zwyD8YOm-y3AbRrsRx7w Based on yelp reviews we chose this restaurant. Sad mistake. Cool ambiance, but so dimly lit the waiter brought us a flashlight. The waiter failed to tell us they were out of the salmon dinner and goulash after we tried to order. The rolls weren't fresh and worst of all that was the same bread that seemed to be cut up for dipping in the cheese fondue. The fondue itself was pretty good, but did have a very strong flavor of wine and 'kirsch', which is mentioned on the menu. I also ordered the escargot bourguinon, which wasn't too bad, just an overload of parsley and not much garlic. My husband had the 7oz sirloin and it was average. We've had better steaks at chain restaurants. The service was below average. You won't get an awful meal here, but it won't be that good either. If the other reviews on yelp weren't so highly recommended and our bill not so expensive, I might not have been so dissapointed.
