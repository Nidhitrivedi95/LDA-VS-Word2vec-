vLkKorA1gPS97Zj0_WKA0Q I love love love this place.  Everytime I am in Vegas, I eat here at least once.  People don't let those negative reviews fool you.  Go to vegas, book your dinner with your loved one @ Twist.  You will walk out very happy.  Not sure what to eat? Simple, Pierre Gagnaire Tasting menu will make you extremely satisfied.  For two people without wine, you are looking to spend about $500 including tips and beverage.  With wine pairing, add extra $250 or so.  But honestly, save yourself on wine, they are not that great.  However, everything I had on my tasting menu worth every penny.  I have had dinner at Twist four times now and I always left 100% satisfied.  You will too ;)
