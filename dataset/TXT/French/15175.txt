63qPRnFAjxtchnSTWBxwbw I tend to not be too into chain restaurants, but anything that involves fresh cheesecurds typically has me sold.  I had yet to try a legit Poutine in Montreal, and Frite Alors seemed like the place to go.

With a few Veggies in our crowd, we were pleased to learn they even had a meat-free option (I'm not entirely convinced the gravy was vegetarian, but hey, if they tell me it's not meat I ain't pushin it).  

Prices weren't bad, and as I've come to find of the Service Industry in general in Montreal, they were extremely accommodating.  People split various entrees, and they offered to split individual bills, and would evenly divide things people had split onto individual bills - the Veggie Poutine they divided onto 4 separate bills!

Tasty, filling, and fun.  Go to Frite Alors for a classic Poutine experience!
