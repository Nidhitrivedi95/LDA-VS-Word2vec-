9ET_RUNztevq4_OLAX80Gg Not much to say, however I really did enjoy the food  presented to me this evening. Tasted flavourful and was texture filled. The service at the table was subpar to what i was expecting, however I can't say its a complaint, more of a, there is room to improve type of critique. I give the benefit of doubt that its a busy day and the servers are probably exhausted, but for me to give more than standard gratuity, you have to try a lot harder. Overall I say its still a great place to go to, maybe avoid those monstrous evenings of special occasions to not deter your overall experience.
