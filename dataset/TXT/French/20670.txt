AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw I was here for breakfast on New Year's Eve. Didn't have a reservation and the wait was about 20 minutes at 9am ish. 

I had the broccoli quiche ($19) and it was the best ive ever had. Could be a little too rich for breakfast, but it was very delicious. 
I try to be a vegan, and this was the only vegetable dish I could find (although it had eggs and butter I'm sure).
