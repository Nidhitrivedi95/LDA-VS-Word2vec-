KNBHGY4rQVuoHxZf_6ANuw We stayed here for 3 night for Canada's Day. We arrived late night and the check-in went smoothly. We were on the 11th floor but our view from the window is not that great... The room was rather large with a desk, big screen tv and very comfortable king size bed. The bathroom is large and has a separate bathtube and shower. The place is very clean and roomy.

The location of the hotel is great. It's close to the Square Victoria metro stop as well as Chinatown and old Montreal. It's about a 10min walk to rue St. Catherine and 20min to McGill/Mont Royal.

Overall this place is a great place to stay.
