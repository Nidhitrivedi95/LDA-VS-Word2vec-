YUFxSG6idHePsxOmnSHtpQ I'm a regular at this Mimi's for 10 years. I just came out of it feeling I will not come back. I ordered Corned Beef Hash. When I tasted it, it was slightly spoiled so I sent it back. Afterwards, manager took so long to come out and with nonchalant attitude said sorry. I cannot believe how terrible I felt as a customer. Manager needs to shape up and relearn customer relations. He still did not apologize sincerely for the spoiled food. When I mentioned it at the end when my check was brought out, he simply said how would he have known if the food was spoiled. Its his restaurant. Whethet he knew it or not, food was spoiled. Apologize first rather than give lame excuse to a regular customer. They just lost a regular customer.
