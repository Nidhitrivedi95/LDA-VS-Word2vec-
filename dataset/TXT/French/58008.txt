rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Fantastic brunch spot in Vegas at this French establishment by Thomas Keller. We had the chicken and waffle (super tender meat for the chicken and waffle was fluffy and light) and roasted tomato soup (intense flavor clearly made from amazing ingredients). More of a brunch place than a dinner one (600 seatings at brunch vs. 300 seatings at dinner). Fabulous wine menu. Gorgeous ambience with a bit of French elegant brasserie elements. My favorite meal at Vegas.

The wait for a table can be long, so put your name down first and they will call you when it's ready. We ate at bar and it was fantastic (no wait).
