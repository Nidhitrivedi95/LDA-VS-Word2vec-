JvEu_1sJod6DGbYOatFvMQ We didn't have reservations and just stopped by in the late afternoon on a week day.  They sat us promptly even though they were supposed to close in 30 minutes.  We ordered the prix fix menu, and everything was wonderful!  The food came in a timely manner.  We didn't feel rush at all.  We had 4 different types of desserts and they were all divine.  Overall, a great restaurant in terms of food and service!
