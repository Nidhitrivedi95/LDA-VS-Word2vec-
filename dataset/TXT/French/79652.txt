zqNgwQjj0_XAll-neGikIw I won't comment on the ambiance because the place is being renovated.  Well executed familiar French staples served at a great price point and with attentive service.  A stand out for breakfast in an area known for many breakfast standouts.  

My favorite Benedict in town.  It isn't too rich or large.  It is complemented nicely with the potatoes and salad.  The egg is poached to perfection and the ham has a nice balance of texture and fat.
