These days, there's an overabundance of high priced restaurants with mostly mediocre food and terrible service.  

But tucked away in the Monte Carlo Hotel, is Andre's.  A cozy french restaurant and really know how to take care of you and your tastebuds.

The quiet and intimate ambiance is perfect for a date or a nice dinner w/ a few pals.

And the food??  Absolutely amazing!  

They usually start you w/ a small appetizer (literally a bite) that the chef has whipped up.  Every time I've gone, it's always something yummy and different, and on the house :)

I had a filet and it was cooked to perfection and seasoned just right.  I also tried their foie gras appetizer and their garden salad.  The presentation was wonderful and the food was so delicious.

My husband also ordered the foie gras martini, and OMG it was amazing!  Of course you'll have to like foie gras in the first place, but even I liked it!  Normally i can't stand more than just a taste of foie gras.  The chef actually comes out and pours the martini for you and even grates white truffles on top of it at your table.

I resisted getting dessert after all that food...and then they brought out a little tray of small chocolates and nuts...again, on the house.  it was just what i needed w/o stuffing a slice of cake into my already bursting gullet.  wow...

Still, the best part had to be the service.  

I absolutely disdain going to a nice restaurant and having to track the waiter down, or even worse, the waiter making me feel like he's doing me a favor by serving me in the first place.  I strongly believe that the whole point of a nice restaurant should be the service.  

Andre's did not disappoint one bit.  They were polite, timely, and extremely friendly.  I would give them 10 stars for their services and manners if i could.

All in all, don't miss this place if you're looking to have a nice meal that's actually worth it.
