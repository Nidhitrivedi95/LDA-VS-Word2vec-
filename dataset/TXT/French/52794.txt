qCSyiWDbjks5OeWHlLqd7w very intimate, to a fault.  tables were so close we knew that Jenn was the only one in the restaurant who had the char.  what seemed to be the most popular choice. and what I chose, was the bison filet.  everything was delicious and excellently prepared.  the byob option is always appreciated, pairing suggestions would have been nice but we did well withe the white to start the meal, less well with the red, my fault.  go here.
