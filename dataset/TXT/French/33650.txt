hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA Soup, sandwiches, quiche and ginger! I went in again this week for a quick lunch, and I was still pleased as pudding. Oliver was there, charming as ever. I ordered a quiche and a cup of soup, and both were delicious. However, even though the food is the perfect lunch, I am equally enthralled by the ginger beverages! They take special care to carry natural beverages (no high fructose), and this time they had straight up ginger ale with chunks of ginger. That alone is enough to earn repeat visits from me!
