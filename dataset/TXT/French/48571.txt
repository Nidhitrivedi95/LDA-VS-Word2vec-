ohMpNug5zWNxOlL6ShG7Ig Went here for happy hour after it was highly recommend. What a disappointment it started with our waitress rude attitude when my husband had something in his water her response was "it could be anything" she disappeared for about 20 minutes after our food came I ended up sending my salad back the turkey on it was severely under cooked. Would never go back.
