4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw We heard great things about Mon Ami Gabi, so we decided to try it for dinner. They gave is complimentary fresh warm baguette with room temp butter. Pretty good, we asked for a second loaf. We started with appetizers and ordered the Escargots. Omg, they were so good. The garlic herb butter that the escargots was seasoned with were amazing. The snails were juicy and very tasty. We all loved it so much we ordered another two... And used up all the complimentary bread by soaking up the delicious garlic herb butter! I ordered the mushroom soup and the hanger steak. Both were just OK. The soup was really bland, had no flavor at all. Hanger steak was alright, also lacked flavor. I think most people rave about their breakfast/brunch menu, so I'll probably have to come back to give Mon Ami Gabi another try for breakfast... That's if I can wake up early enough.. Saying noone sleeps earlier than 4am when in Vegas!
