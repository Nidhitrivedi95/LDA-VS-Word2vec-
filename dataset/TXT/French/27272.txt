dd3GZs6zW2t7BM0cbxAzvg I spied La Palette early one Sunday morning while wandering around Queen West before anything had opened. It looked so beautiful and inviting, and as a French bistro, like exactly that which I love the most. I knew I would have no time to enjoy a meal there as my partner and I only had one non-work dinner night free -- we already had reservations for that night. But, after one long day at work and an unsatisfying dinner my partner and I decided to wander over and see if we could stop in for a dinner and a drink -- and what a lovely time we had. Our bartender, a soft-spoken and lovely man, must have been the owner as he had such joy in talking with us about La Palette's fabulous array of spirits and cordials -- I love unique spirits and after dinnder drinks and La Palette's selection was truly special, less for the volume of selections, but more for their uniqueness and the obvious care with which they were all chosen. My partner started off with an aged Calvados, of which there were several from which to choose, and I started with an apricot eau-de-vie (Apricot!), and followed it with a quite remarkable chamomile grappa, mellow, pollen-y, and yellow like a late summer sun. We also ordered some desserts, Tarte au Citron, and the trio of creme brulee. Both were excellent, though the greatest joy was the pleasant atmosphere and great conversation we had with the staff and other patrons who all seemed to having as pleasant an evening as we were. It was a refuge that we greatly enjoyed,
