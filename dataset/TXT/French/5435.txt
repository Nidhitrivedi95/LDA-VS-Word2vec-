The interior is very intimate and romantic and old style, with Victorian hex tiles on the floor of the main part where we were sitting looking out to the street from the garage pane windows.  

We ordered escargot to share, my friend had the lamb shank for her main, and I had the duck confit with a glass of the Minervois region red. The escargots were excellent as the sauce, which was likely some red wine reduction, had a lot of flavour with entire cloves of garlic and diced tomatoes. The lamb was tender, as was the duck, but the parsnip mash was particularly good, and stood out in my mind. I preferred the lamb, but my friend preferred the duck because it retained the duck flavour well, so I guess it's a matter of personal preference, but needless to say, we enjoyed both the mains. As a note, the red was full bodied, not particularly dry, and went nicely with the duck.

For dessert, we shared a creme brulee, for which the custard was not overly egg-y or sweet, though I found it a little odd that the custard was cold when served. I am used to having it at room temperature. Nonetheless, the flavour was good, and the portion generous.

The service was probably what put me over the top for this place. We had a main male server (I wish I knew his name...) and a female server to assist on the side. They were the right amounts of attentive, and very, very professional and kind. I am always a bit apprehensive about going to French restaurants when I am only able to speak English, because sometimes I get poor service on account of my language. Both our servers were friendly and attentive, and the guy even gave us dessert on the house! 

Terrific dining experience.
