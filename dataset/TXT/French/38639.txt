jLxeBgWhLRbII2ACkgH1Sg Pastries are subpar here compared to Patisserie. But we come sporadically because of the plentiful outdoor seating. Service is usually pretty slow but today was the worst! Why, might you ask? They completely forgot about our order. As in, 50 minutes later, we walk in to ask about our order and they said they didn't have it and simply offered to take our orders again. No remorse, no apologies. Never coming back again
