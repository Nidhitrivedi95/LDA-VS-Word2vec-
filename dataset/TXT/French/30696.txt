FVY75lAgzS4BKFPnZ8oHeA Chez Leveque is pretty special and an oddly spiritual experience.

We ventured in here for a late, prix fixe nosh. Two of three courses for I don't remember what price. Coming here was a fantastic idea. The service is great; the host is engaging, the server is attentive and on the ball with great recommendations. Clearly, the management knows how to train and/or hire. 

They have a cool, tilted mirror on the ceiling over the oyster bar where you can watch the oyster boy shuck away. 

Their drinks are inventive and themed after the seven deadly sins. I had the Luxuraire and L'envie, the latter of which was better. 

For my appetizer, I selected the croquette salmon and veggies. It was pretty crunchy and the veggies were crisp and delicious. Crab cakes and frites for my main were decent, though I think the appetizer overshadowed it to a certain point. The presentation was great. 

The restaurant itself is pretty interesting. The washroom has an antique prie dieu in the middle, the mirrors are cathedral-cut and you get the background score of some haunting monk chants while you go about your business. 

As an aside, the worst-date-ever was in full motion at a nearby table for some poor woman. Some yelling ensued and staff handled the situation very professionally.
