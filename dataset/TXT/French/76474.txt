Yp9w4nhUowBU_IS_StFXbQ My friends and I decided to try Tableau when we felt like a fancy brunch that was not a buffet. The ambiance is extremely impressive, with such a classy setup that I completely forgot I was in the middle of Sin City. 

Besides the ambiance though, I was rather disappointed by almost everything else. The service was downright terrible, with our waiter practically ignoring our table and us having to ask multiple times to get our water refilled. One redeeming factor about the long wait for food is that they brought out a complimentary plate of fruit. 

The food was alright, but definitely not the quality I would expect when paying so much. The Salmon Eggs Benedict was a bit bland, and the crab sandwich had way too much batter (seriously to the point I could not taste crab anymore). The Banana Sour Cream Pancakes were great, but not worth the $17 price tag. 

Also, a lot of the photos on Yelp show the most delicious looking milk chocolate soufflé cake. When I asked the waiter about it, he said the soufflé was discontinued over 2 years ago :(

Tableau had the potential to be great, I just wish it was executed better.
