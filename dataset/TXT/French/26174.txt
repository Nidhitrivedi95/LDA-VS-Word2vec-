d482l58ho0_IMdFkXX1F5Q Came here after the Super Bowl Sunday! My wife and I were hungry from all the yelling and cheering for the Pats! No line, we got seated right away.
They served us right away with bake baguette and focaccia bread. Both are delicious.
We had sea bass and braised short ribs both were outstandingly palatable! The short ribs melt in your mouth. The sea bass was fresh and with no back taste. We had 2 glasses of Cabernet with our meal which brings out the taste of the ribs.
For dessert, we had the molten chocolate cake with ice cream. hmmm delightful!
It's very pricey but we used house money to pay for the dinner so win win for us!
5 star, Highly recommended with outstanding service!
