4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw There is food to be gorged on, to eat quickly and get on with your day. Then there is the breakfast at Mon Ami Gabi, this is not food to inhale, but food to savor, enjoy every bite. We came in as a party of three, and despite the initial mix-up (they thought it was for two, not three), we were seated in a matter of minutes. 

I chose this place after simply looking at the reviews, 5800+ reviews and averaging over 4 stars? I was not disappointed in the results!

I ordered one of the two specials that day. A Lemon Pancake, topped with with freshly prepared papaya and with a side of *actual* whipped cream, not the cheap stuff that comes from a can. I'll be honest, though, it looked like a giant crepe to me, but I digress, it was absolutely worth every bite! They ensured it was just sweet enough to leave any sweet tooth satisfied and without the sugar overload. One of our party ordered the Chicken, Bree, and Apple Crepe, I tried a bite, sweet mother of Christ was it a bite. It was that one bite that made me wish I had ordered it instead! A blend of Savory and Sweet, with incredible Bree to bridge the two, you could not ask for a more satisfying dish! 

Whether or not you get the outside seating, the atmosphere is as grand as one would expect, and the inexpensive prices hide the immense quality you will get from these dishes. 

If you are ever in Vegas, walk down to Mon Ami Gabi, and savor every bite.
