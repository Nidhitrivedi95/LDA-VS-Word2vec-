4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw An affordable place that makes you feel special. As a student, Vegas trip usually means cramming as many people into the room as possible, getting drank, fist pumping to the music, and the morning/noon pho as hang over cure. A fancy dinner and show is not in the picture. 

Most of the places are owned by famous chefs that comes with a hefty price tag that we can't afford. wahhh :(

My friend told me about Mon Ami Gabi, and this change my Vegas trip completely. It definitely up my vegas trip class level by a lot without having to spend extra $$$$$. 

Most of the items on the menu are under $20 and closer to $15, except the steaks.  Thus without having to spend a fortune, you can sit in the patio by the strip and watch the Bellagio water show! 

I ordered the Smoked Salmon & Egg Salad Tartine which was fantastic. I would not make any modification to it. I love the way it is. 

The friend who recommend this place told me that the escargots were really good. I didn't get to try because I am still on a budget...

My roommate and I shared flour-less chocolate cake. My roommate really enjoyed the cake. We cleaned the plate! The cake was topped with some sort of sour cream, which we didn't really care much and wished it was ice cream. 

To start the meal, they give each table  a loaf of french baguette and butter. If you can't have gluten, you can still have some bread just ask! They even have a gluten-free menu.

They do take reservation; however, patio seating is first come first serve basis. The interior design gives a pretty old school classy vibe, so even if you can't get a table outside, it would still be a great experience.
