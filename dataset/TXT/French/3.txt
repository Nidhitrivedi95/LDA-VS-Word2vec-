-4TMQnQJW1yd6NqGRDvAeA We ended up at The House Brasserie for my husband's 50th birthday, coming all the way from Seattle to celebrate by staying at The Biltmore and eating at Cafe Monarch... it's a long story, but Cafe Monarch was not at all accommodating even after  making reservations 6 weeks prior, so luckily their chef, Christian, sent us over to House Brasserie. What a gift! House Brasserie has a beautiful setting, top notch service and wonderfully creative and delicious food. Our bill was quite large, but definitely worth it. The wine was special and our particular menu favorites were the ribeye and the fois gras. We had top executives from Microsoft and Expedia and we all agree- we will be back! Thank you to Chef Matt for a very special, memorable evening.
