vLkKorA1gPS97Zj0_WKA0Q Amazing experience dining at Twist. 

The restaurant is very inviting and has a cute "twisted" branches themed decor at its entrance. Inside the space is open and warmly staged. From top to bottom, the service at Twist was spectacular. Much more than I would expect from a French restaurant (since those restos are usually on the stuffy and formal side...sometimes snobby as well). At Twist, all of the wait staff are professional, warm and friendly. Not once did I feel pressured to order more costly items to up the bill (which happened to us at the Aria cafe the next day -$4banana topping to a waffle- smh).

Onto the food...

Where do I start? Awesome, awesome, awesome. The star of the night was the 6.5oz American waygu filet. I was skeptical at first since I have not really enjoyed waygu at other restaurants (too fatty for me), but this cut was amazing. So delicious, tender & flavorful. Better than any steakhouse I've eaten at (mastros, Flemings, Cut, capital grille & Eddies). Nigerian prawns were delicious (trumpet mushrooms are the bomb) and the 1 salad on the menu was rocking. Thank you Twist chef&staff for a lovely dinner and culinary adventure; until next time!
