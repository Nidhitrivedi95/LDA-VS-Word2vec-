rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Bouchon never disappoints.  Over the years, I've had many a good meal there and I plan on continuing to do so.  Everything they do is done with absolute precision and attention to detail, but at very reasonable prices!  Some of my favorites have included a gnocchi entree with chanterelle mushrooms (dumplings were pillowy and irresistible), roast chicken (simple yet perfectly satisfying), and foie gras terrine (decadent but worthy of the calories).  The creme caramel is also a must!  Whatever you decide on, Bouchon will blow you away.
