bzbNGyrTwWHAgg1CqkSgeg I've been to Terrace Cafe for lunch a few times, but recently tried it for dinner.  I was a little disappointed they weren't serving the red velvet waffles at dinner time, but I went ahead and ordered from the dinner menu.  The chicken was delicious!!  I was not disappointed!  My husband said his mussels were excellent also.
