KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA The view and atmosphere are always nice, although the food is just average.  I've been several times since the new owners have taken over, and it has been disappointing every time.  The typical brasserie food is completely overprice, and the portions seem to keep getting smaller.  The entree of muscles is less then half of what it used to be, and the french fries are not as good.  I was hoping this local establishment was getting better, but clearly that is not the case.  Sadly, we won't be back! 

BTW, there was a wedding party on the terrace there as well.  The constant passing of guests was quite irritating.  In addition, there was live music and the regular restaurant music playing simultaneously.  This ruined the tranquil setting!  Even our waiter was embarrassed!
