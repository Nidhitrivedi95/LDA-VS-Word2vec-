SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ We went to the house of tricks before a show at asu gammage. We sat inside, as it was still a little too warm to sit outside. The service was slow and you are not allowed to order anything from the happy hour menu when dining inside. We had the scallop appetizer to start it was pretty good but was not very warm. I got the steak and the husband got the tuna.  The food was good, not life changing by any means. However, all the food that came out again was not very hot. The table next to us had to find their server because the service was too slow for them. I liked the patio vibe of this location but I will not be back, as there is better dining choices in Phoenix. This restaurant is over hyped, I was disappointed.
