uP3H5bcsiTXM0k0xQhRndg The food was good. Solid. I would not say I was blown away. The restaurant informed us that it was family owned and the ingredients were fresh from the farm, and that was the reasoning for the small menu. I would say that I wished there was more to their menu, maybe just 1 or two options more.  

The salmon was very fresh. The pork belly was good but I've had better. The mac and cheese was slightly disappointing as we were not expecting it to be more sweet than savory.  Wines available were a nice touch.
