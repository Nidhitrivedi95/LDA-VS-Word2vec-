rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Two words: EXCELLENT STAFF. I loved how the waiters were so professional and courteous to all of us. They gave great recommendations, joked around with us & made our dinner even more enjoyable than it already was.

Bouchon is Thomas Keller's hidden gem tucked on the 2nd floor of the Venetian. I highly recommend it to anyone visiting Vegas.

Came here during a bachelorette party because we wanted to take the bride-to-be somewhere special. So fancy that, we found Thomas Keller's restaurant here :)

As a group, we shared the cheese plate. We weren't the biggest fan of it - maybe because some of us weren't cheese people. It was recommend by the waiter. Well if you are a cheese person, then this is the appetizer plate to get & share!

I ordered the Poulet Rôti. I cannot begin to describe the savoriness of this dish. The chicken was baked soft with a crisp layer of skin covering it. Plus to be covered in that sauce & its juice was just amazing. The pears added a nice sweet touch to the dish and the mustard added a bit of spice flavoring.

I will definitely be returning back here when I come back to Vegas. Delicious dinner. Great staff. Picturesque decor. Love, love, love!

Make sure to make a reservation!
