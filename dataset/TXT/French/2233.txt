0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g Probably one of the best restaurants I've ever been to! I loved every dish they had, from the seared foie to the lobster salad to even their amuse bouche! Everything was perfect, and everything was delicious! I feel that it's hard to find a restaurant where EVERY dish is good, but this place seems to have done just that. Wine pairings were pretty great as well, and definitely enhanced each course.

The ambience is gorgeous, with authentic Picasso artwork adorning the walls, and a view of the Bellagio fountains right in front. Service was top-notch, as well.

I definitely want to come back again.... but next time, I gotta make sure I don't lose my $$$ at the casinos afterwards lol.
