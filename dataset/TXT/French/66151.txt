ufwkkMd9yr9cFU1R5ONArg This place is legit!! I can't recall having such an overall satisfying meal. Toronto is filled with restaurants and it's such stiff competition however, this place surely stands out for anyone that tries it.

It has a great Queen West vibe on Lakeshore in Etobicoke. It's a small place but if you get stuck in a small line it is definitely worth the wait.

Start off, coffee was nice with constant refills. I took a look at the "brunch beverages" however, after the previous night all I really wanted was coffee and water. Any other brunch outing I would have tried any of them. They also have a nice list of fresh squeezed juices and smoothies. 

Now, let's get to the good part -- food! I had the huevos rancheros and oooohhhhh emmmm geeee! So good! I won't deny that I make a fantastic guacamole so I'm always looking for something with quality flavour - with the red onions, it added a really nice addition to the meal and the baguettes were nice and crispy. 

I live in the area but typically find myself downtown however, this may be my new breakfast joint!
