dDKhRQlw_OVsPLQAGAeNyA Really more of a 3.5. 

Quaint, charming and lovely restaurant. Good and amiable service. 

Their food has a home-cooked style to it - it's not particularly pretentious about food presentation, but it's confident in the quality and taste of the food itself. My brother ordered the duck leg (which was amazing and so tender) while I had the chicken breast stuffed with goat cheese.

All mains come with soup/salad and dessert. Please do yourself a favour and pick the lemon tart! My brother was a bit disappointed with his almond cake, but I definitely loved my choice.

Their wine menu was a bit odd, in my opinion. Maybe I'm not used to it, but I had to ask separately for the menu for wine by-the-glass. The menu had no description as to each type of wine - they were simply labelled 'Riesling', "Pinot Grigio", etc. Would have liked to know where it's from, from year, etc. I still enjoyed my wine, but it doesn't make sense to have to ask about each wine one by one.
