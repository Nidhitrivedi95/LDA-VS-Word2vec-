4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw We come here every time we are in Vegas and have the best dining experience:  food, service, cost and of course, the view of Bellagio and its fountain.  This would be our 5th time here. We highly recommend their burgers and sandwiches for lunch.  Of course start off with escargot, every time.  For dinner, we've had their fish and steak.  Reserve in advance for patio seating or table just in the atrium, if it is windy season.  We are coming back again in about 3 months!
