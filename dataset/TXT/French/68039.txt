vg55SAkrEmuHpWfIMtJjBQ I've been going here with my family since they were at their original location in Regent Square, and I've honestly never had a bad meal. Now that I'm a poor postgrad this is definitely my "Moooom, buy me dinner cuz I'm visiting!" place. I adore their bluefish pate, all their soups, the chicken under a skillet, and the ricotta ravioli. The desserts are always good too, especially the gingerbread and the rice pudding they have during the winter. They also used to have this dynamite cold brew coffee--bring that back! It's nice to have a place dedicated to farm to table and local produce, and Trevett and Sarah, the owners, are so nice and open about what they do and how they source their food. Trevett's love for this food definitely comes through in what's on your plate!

The cocktails come from their bar next door; I am a sucker for tiki drinks and I can highly recommend the Shark Tank. It even comes with a cocktail umbrella! Now that's the kind of attention to detail that counts.
