KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA This was the first time here. You walk in the front doors to find yourself in a very cool wine shop. We were there for a private wine tasting and had some excellent wines and food off a diverse, however pricey menu. It was getting late, so we decided to order a couple of appetizers, eggplant and the escargot, both very well prepared. The true highlight of this establishment is that's  on the water in Desert Shores. You couldn't have a better back drop. I understand brunch is wonderful. We will certainly comeback for the experience
