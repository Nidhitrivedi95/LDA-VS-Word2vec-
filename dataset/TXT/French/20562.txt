AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw If you're looking for a nice lunch but don't want to spend too much, then go to Payard's.  The dining area is small - seats about 50.  They have a $19 prix fixe for lunch, which includes an appetizer, entree, and dessert.  The best part is that you can choose from like 14 desserts, which normally cost $7 each at the patisserie.  They also give you a basket of bread - we had two different types, but I later saw a few tables with three different kinds.  You only get to choose between two options for the appetizer and entree, so we tried both.  The portions were not tiny as I had expected them to be.  We got the:

-Asparagus Salad - This wasn't a real salad.  It was basically white and green asparagus drenched in oil and balsamic vinegar along with ciabatta toast.  It was quite a lot of asparagus.
-Mushroom Tart - Excellent!  Mushrooms were not overpowering and the tart was light and crisp with a semi-sweet cream sauce.
-Sea Bass with Bok Choy and Chocolate Soy Sauce - I think this might have been frozen and not fresh because it came in a round filet.  However, it still tasted good - the sauce was excellent - along with a couple of baby bok choys and carrots.
-Lamb w/ Chicken Cous Cous - Yummy cous cous.  Lamb was cooked very well done in flat sticks akin to flat sausages.  
-Swiss Relief - Mango Mousse and Pineapple Souffle surrounded by Meringue.  I love meringue, though this desert was overall quite sweet.
-Sicilian - Madeline sponge cake filled w/ cream cheese mousse, cranberry jam, and crushed pistachios.  We got this one bc it sounded interesting, and it was!  I liked the cream cheese part the best (sort of like cheesecake) but I wasn't too fond of the sour cranberry jam.

I highly recommend coming here for a nice lunch with a good value!  I think they change the prix fixe lunch menu every season.
