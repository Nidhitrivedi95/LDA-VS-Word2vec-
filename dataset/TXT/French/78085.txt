YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g Great place for tapas! I did the mini tasting for 2 people and it was plenty of food! Well worth the money! Do not be fooled by the small first course. Each course gets bigger and finally ends with a 5th course dessert! Everything was delicious and flavorful. The Beef carpaccio and ahi tuna tacos were light and refreshing. The truffle soup was to DIE for! The bone marrow was deeply rich. The shrimp and grits were spicy and perfectly cooked. The grilled octopus was a bit unexpectedly acidic but still light. The steak was succulent pairing well with the french fries. The lobster mac and cheese was worth every calorie and tasted even better the following morning. The brioche beignets was a perfect ending to a great meal!
