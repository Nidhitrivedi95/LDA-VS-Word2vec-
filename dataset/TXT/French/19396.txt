Without getting lost in the belly of the Venetian beast, you can easily get here as it's right on the Strip.  There's such an incredible amount of their delicious baked goods.  

Kougin Aman is fantastic as are their Sticky Buns.

I can never get enough of Bouchon Bakery in Yountville and I'm so glad to have mapped out the route to easily get to this location while in Vegas.

It's as good as it gets!
