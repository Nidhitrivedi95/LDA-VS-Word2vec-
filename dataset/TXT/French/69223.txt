w2tr0PA0b3tg8pId0kjM-A SO YUMMYYYYYYYY.

SC and I were in PGH visiting and were craving dessert. This place had great reviews on Yelp so we decided to check it out! 

Gaby Et Jules has a lot of pretty pastries but we were there to buy macarons. We got the lavender cassis, peach violet, mango saffron, white chocolate basil, and le pittsburgh. The mango was our least favorite (which was disappointing; we love mango!). There just wasn't any detectable mango nor saffron flavor. The white chocolate basil was our favorite- beautiful basil flavor! We really enjoyed the other flavors also- we've had macarons from a lot of places and we loved how the macarons here (minus the mango one) had so much flavor infused in them. We loved them so much we went back the next day to buy more for our trip back home haha.
