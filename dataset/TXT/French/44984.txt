The bad: 
The chicken meals that we got weren't that great, also weren't  crispy.
Serves weren't great, not well organized a bit messy; waiters were a bit rough even hit my mother on here hand while he was placing the ice cup in front of here.
As well as, the waiters was rude, interfering with the tip that I was typing in the machine. Even said  most people pay 15% to 20%, I increased it to 20 dolars; still didn't like it. 

Washroom didn't has soap.
