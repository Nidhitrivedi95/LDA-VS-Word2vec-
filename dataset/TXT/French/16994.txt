9ET_RUNztevq4_OLAX80Gg I came here for my friends bachelorette party.  I am giving this place four stars because the dessert and appetiser were amazing enough to make up for the unimpressive main.

I ordered the fennel risotto as my appetiser.  It was creamy and rich with a hint of piquant flavour given by the lemony shrimp.  I really enjoyed it and was thankful that the portion size was large. 

I chose the pacific halibut as my main.  It lacked flavour and was nothing special. 

For dessert I had the warm chocolate coulant.  Wow, this dessert was to die for.  The gooey chocloateyness of the coulant along with the salty sweetness of the caramelised milk ice cream was cloud nine in my mouth ; ) mmmm...
