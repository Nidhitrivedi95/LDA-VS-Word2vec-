O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q This restaurant has a nice view of the Strip and looks fancy. The waiters are friendly and professional. Everything seems to be in order here, making it seem like the food will be just as fantastic. I came here for brunch and I have to say that I found my salad nicoise to be less than spectacular.  I don't want to use the word bland but I really do think they need to use just a tad more salt in their dishes. Maybe it's just me... I am in a love/hate relationship with sodium.

Their bloody mary's looked amazing though, and I'm disappointed (at myself) for not ordering it. Next time!
