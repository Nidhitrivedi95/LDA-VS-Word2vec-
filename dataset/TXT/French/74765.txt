xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g My girlfriends and I went here for Brunch and we were all really pleased with our food, and while on the pricier side, it was definitely not as bad as I thought it was going to be when we got up there. They bring fresh bread and butter to your table (even at brunch), which is pretty much my favorite thing on earth. They also provide an amuse bouche which was a delicious surprise. Our main dishes were great as well. OH AND THAT VIEW THOUGH. Loved it. During the day was awesome because we could watch the fountain show. I was less than impressed with the cocktails though. My bloody mary was ok, but I had a drink that I believe was called the sparkling rose and it was just fine. But I've definitely had way better 20 dollar cocktails than that. 

A side note on the service, the server's assistant (a young guy, didn't catch his name) was awesome and super attentive. The server was not really that memorable but she was adequate. However, I wanted to give the bartender a talking to...He was rude, I asked for a food menu while we waited and he responded "I don't have one, I'll have to go over and get one, we don't serve food at the bar", in a super condescending tone. I assumed that meant he would walk over and get one, but he didn't, so I got up to do it myself. That would have been fine, had my cocktail been 8 dollars, but I'm not paying for an extra side of attitude. And he kept calling me "my dear", which is only endearing if you're an older lady or gentleman, homeboy was barely 30, so it was just annoying. Any way, the service doesn't affect my review, just venting :)
