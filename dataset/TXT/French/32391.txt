gxMa7j1LXIUxxBoP0osDpA The location was a stretch for us. Quite a ways from Centre Ville and the Old City. But the food is worth the trouble! It is a lovely BYOB - so we splurged on a bottle of sparkling wine. The scallop ceviche appetizer was good, but the rest of dinner was superb! We shared the lemon vodka sorbet as  palette cleanser and it was truly delicious. The amuse-bouche was a cold cauliflower soup that was especially tasty. A real treat. I had salmon and for a commonly prepared fish the preparation was extraordinary--the fish soft, tender, and flaky and buttery. The sauce very distinctive and delicious. We were too full for dessert but they looked wonderful!
