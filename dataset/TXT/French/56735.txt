rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I've been here for brunch and dinner, both were enjoyable experiences, but I prefer brunch. 

For brunch I got something similar to a continental breakfast. Came with sausage, potatoes, egg, toast, pastry, fresh fruit, coffee and juice. 

They also have great mimosas and bellinis!

For dinner, I had their trout, which was not pleasant I would not recommend. The only part of meal that I remember and loved was the chocolate bouchon we had for dessert. Denser than regular chocolate cake but not as dense as a brownie, served warm with vanilla ice cream, the perfect dessert! 

Came really early for brunch so we didn't need to make a reservation, but definitely should make a reservation for dinner.
