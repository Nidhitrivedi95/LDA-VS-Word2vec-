O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q Hey, I love a good steak like every other person (minus vegans), but I've never been wowed by a steak. 

The bone in rib eye here is really good - it's cooked well - when you ask for medium rare they deliver on that perfectly and it's seasoned well.  In case you get tired of the old salt and pepper flavoring, they offer you three different sauces to dip the steak in.  One is a salsa mix, another is au jus, and the last is ... well, just as delicious.

I've heard recently that it's not as good as it used to be, but I've only got fond memories of this place.

It'll run you about $120 a person if you have a drink and appetizers, which I highly recommend.  Make it a complete meal, it'll be worth it.

I know there's better steak out there, I just haven't found it yet...

The search continues.
