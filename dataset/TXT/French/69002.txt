VwZhwflLnTq19aAeFLJHCQ Decided to take my family to dinner when they were in town visiting.  Called ahead to make a reservation since we were a party of 8.  Really don't have anything negative to say, food and service were great.    Really enjoyed the singer/pianist and the atmosphere.  My only small complaint was the cost of the daily special, when looking at the menu you would assume it is priced along with the rest of the menu but it was almost double, so was kind of of a shock, but still very delicious.  Will definitely come back and look forward to sitting outside this spring/summer when the weather is nice.  Thank you for putting a bistro like this in our community, it is long over due.
