Our group was fortunate to have Jonathan as our server. He was very attentive and not a single thing was wrong ! By far the best server I have ever had. 

Surf and Turf was very succulent which came with Lobster Tail and Stake. I highly recommend this platter and all of the sides are good but it's obviously up to your flavor of taste. 

The view is great and there is also a lounge/outdoor lounge/club overlooking the strip as soon as you exit the restaurant !
