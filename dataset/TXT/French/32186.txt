gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA I am a cook.. Have been for years, so trust me when I say Alize is overpriced. 
I did the 7 course taster menu most of the dishes had expensive ingredients but the flavor was laking on almost everything. Meal was a car payment and the service was ok nothing special, ive def had better service and food for cheaper..   I was disappointed I thought it would wow me and it fell very short
