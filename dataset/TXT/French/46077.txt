This place has very delicious food, some quality wines, and great service, but the thing that really makes this restaurant is the ambience. I don't know why, but getting the volume, tempo and feel of background music just right is something that most restaurants fail to do  not so at Maison Bleue. They have it sorted. It's unobtrusive, and perfect for dining. The soft-lighting is perfect too, even if you are here with two others for a semi-business meal, rather than staring across the table into the eyes of a loved one on a romantic night out.
Not being a french speaker, there were a few items on the menu I didn't know, but the friendly wait staff were very happy to help out. Between three, we shared the chef's recommended starter plates, which came as 6 separate items on two plates; I highly recommend the aubergine, halloumi and caramelised onion stacks. Mmm mmm. For the main, my companions both enjoyed (and recommended) monkfish cheeks cooked in Moroccan spices accompanied by Ratatouille, and my sea bream with shrimp risotto was yummy! One of my companions believes you can judge a restaurant by the quality of the Creme Brulee. and, well, next time I won't be sharing mine.
The restaurant is handy to the grassmarket and royal mile, so is the perfect place for a tourist to finish off a day exploring the city, or for a local to kick off an evening out.
The only thing I have to complain about is that you have to climb two flights of stairs to get to use the washroom  but maybe that isn't a bad thing after indulging in creme brulee and a few glasses of vino?
I thoroughly enjoyed the evening Maison Bleue should definitely be on everyones list of places to dine.
