4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Quite frankly the Eggs Florentine were disgusting. Runny eggs with no texture slopped over what could have been a great crisp English muffin. The hash fries that came with it were super greasy. 
The hubby had apple crepe with chicken & brie-this was good. 
The servers are friendly and courteous but please don't give me the check before I ask for it. You have no idea if I was finished or wanted to order anything else.
Bottomline-Eggs Florentine not worth the $14.95 -the food is sub par.
