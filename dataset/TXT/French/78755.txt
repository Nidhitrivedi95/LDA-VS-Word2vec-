ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug We had planned on eating at the buffet Saturday morning, but we quickly realized that the line would be a minimum hour and we were starving. We continued walking and found this place that only had a small line, and bonus, had an all day breakfast menu along with their lunch and dinner options!

We were seated within about 10 minutes and ordered mimosas (they were good). 
I ordered the fixed lunch menu that was only $20 for a salad, a choice of 3 entrees (I had the croque monsieur), and a napoleon for dessert. My husband, loving eggs, opted for the croque madame lunch meal.

I really wanted fries also, so I asked the waiter and he said that he would bring some to me. We started with delicious french bread and then my salad came with an excellent bleu cheese dressing.

Both my husband and I really enjoyed our sandwiches. The bread they used was delicious as was the cheese. 

The little mini napoleon I got in the end was also great!...even though it was about 3 bite's worth LOL.

We were definitely glad we tried this place! It was delicious and a quick bite! We would certainly return!
