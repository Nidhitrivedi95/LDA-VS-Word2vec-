mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q The wife and I recently came here while on vacation. We've heard so many great things about JR over the years, it was time we gave one of his restaurants a try. I have to say, L'Atalier certainly lives up to his reputation. While not as elegant or pricey as the signature restaurant next door, the quality of food is incredible, and it is very fun being able to watch the chefs meticulously prepare each course. The service is impeccable, and they will cater to any dietary needs you may have. We both got the discovery menu, and I requested no cheese, which was no problem at all. My wife liked the potato purée so much they provided her with an extra bowl of it on the side, which was also beautifully prepared. All in all, a fantastic experience. We look forward to trying JR's signature restaurant on our next visit.
