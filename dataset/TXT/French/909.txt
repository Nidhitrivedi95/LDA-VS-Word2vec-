_cjPEH9wXhKS-HQe_U3M4Q Maybe the best dinner we ever had?? Lol. Came here for a nice date. If you enjoy French food, this is probably the best in the city.

Escargots in puff pastry: 11 out of 10. It's that good. The pastry, the sauce, just everything is out of this world. 

French onion soup: 9 out of 10. Wonderful taste, made to perfection. Best I've ever had and I've had a lot. 

Bone marrow: It was fine. I won't rate it because I'm not qualified to rate a delicacy such as this and it was my first time trying it.

Duck confit: 8.5 out of 10 - delicious, fatty, crispy.

8oz peppercorn filet: 8 out of 10 - I'm not a fan of "saucy" steaks but the cut and preparation was phenomenal. 

Gateau chocolat (chocolate cake): 11 out of 10. The best cake either of us have ever had in our lives. Tastes more like a moist brownie or pudding. Incredible. 

Service was good (not extraordinary).

I have a feeling you can do no wrong at this restaurant.
