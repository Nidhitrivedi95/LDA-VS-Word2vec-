ITde2CeOZ6fUG9h3xb-Nag This was my second trip. The bar service is outstanding. Many may not like the food because it is closer to real Itailian than they are used to, your issue is wanting Olive Garden and not going there. However, for you foodies it is way too high  in salt, but still a good meal. The issue is, they don't know who they are. I had great, savy bar maids then servers that didn't know marinara from bolognese. They did, however, at a high middle age have the ability to stick an i pad in front of me and my dinner  mates and proceed w a tutorial of why this important to me instead of a list and answering my questions, and how to use a touch screen. Being $200. Into the evening at this point I asked to speak to the owners who claimed some people loved a tutorial by a waitress on an ipad while trying to socialize w people they enjoy and dine. Maybe, I am not so sure they are not latent out of touch reality kids paying rent at their parents, let alone earning what Valentis needs to collect on dinner to pay their rent. Figure it out, and you are the hosts, how about decent dress, make up etc.  When you are at work. If ethnic club staff are waiting on me giving  lessons to dining, spaghetti dinner ought to be 6.99.  Go shopping, go dining, get a clue.
