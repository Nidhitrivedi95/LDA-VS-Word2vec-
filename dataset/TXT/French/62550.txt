SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ Never disappointed at House of Tricks.  Last night a friend and I went to HOT for a nice dinner while she was in town for a short business trip.  It was a lovely experience.

We started with cocktails. I had the New Old Fashioned which was delicious.  The liquor was infused with vanilla bean and fig and topped with citrus bitters.  So good.  My friend had a margarita that has chili pepper infusion.  She liked her drink too.

We shared the cheese tray, which was excellent.  A nice variety of cheeses, toasty bread, nuts, and grapes.  More than ample portion for two.

We both decided on the short ribs on a bed of white cheese grits.  SO GOOD!  Meat was fall off the bone tender and seasoned to perfection.  Will definitely order this again.

When we arrived we were given the choice of inside or outside seating.  As much as we hated to pass up the beautiful outdoor seating area, it was really hot so we opted for inside.  Go glad we did because we were able to linger over our drinks and dinner while staying completely comfortable.

Our waiter was delighted and provided excellent service.

Love House of Tricks!
