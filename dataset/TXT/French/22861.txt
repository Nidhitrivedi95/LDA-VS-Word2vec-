Prices are right. Service was great. Food is done with care.

My mother ordered the beef soup and a half order of a turkey sandwich. The beef soup surprisingly came with collard greens in it, and the turkey sandwich was filled with grilled onions, melted cheese, chopped turkey, and crispy bacon.

I ordered the Egg Benedict Floratine and I appreciated the care that was taken with the dish. It came topped with crispy fried onions, and the spinach was correctly sautéed. 

Only complaint is the chairs need an upgrade, and the lower level dining room floor plan could have been designed better without placing restrooms facing patrons as they eat.
