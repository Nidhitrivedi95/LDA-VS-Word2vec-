ovtlrcsVRlgZZQUlHs_ovw It's a great looking place; kind of like a trendy nightclub (except filled only with disgruntled, old, rich snobs). I only say that because during the 40 minutes (no joke) I waited for my food, I was seated at a table that was less than two feet away from an elderly couple- that proceeded to whine and complain about every single facet of this restaurant. They hated the food, the prices, and the excruciating wait times (rightfully so). 
This place has great potential for a romantic environment to take your loved ones to, BUT do not expect privacy. Everyone is seated within a few feet of each other. 
The staff is great. Bubbling with excitement, and striking conversations that they obviously don't care about. Completely fake, but very nice.
THE FOOD: I got Duck Confit ($20)... Very delicious! Totally worth the wait. It came with a couple potato cuts on the side- also delicious!! I did have to go get some dinner later because I was still hungry. 
DESSERT: I ordered the CrémBrulet- AMAZING!!! The waitress took it off the bill, because my food took so long. Very co
