cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg Don't miss this restaurant if you are visiting Montreal or are fortunate enough to live there. You can't go wrong and you'll get a real taste of the local culture. They serve some of the best meat dishes I've ever tasted, and the service is friendly and impeccable. If you can't get reservations, go early, as it's almost always packed.
