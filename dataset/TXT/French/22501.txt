BSmqxPbQglQwP2R56OqOag Update - after we went back!  

Went back to Local Bistro with some friends because I really want to love this place. And now I do! Their wine list is seriously the best I have seen in the valley. The four of us managed to polish off two different wines (one with appetizers and one with dinner) during our 2 hour visit. First and foremost we made sure it was okay to stay that long (it was a week night and in the summer so we were cool).

To start we shared roasted beets and calimari but I couldn't eat the calimari because I am gluten free. For dinner I had an amazing caesar salad with salmon that was so good I could eat it every day! One other of us had the chicken and wild mushrooms and two had the special fish of the day. All the dishes were amazing (according to everyone's mmmmm'ing) and our service was fabulous! Because it was summer, we even had a chance to banter with our server and he shared his background with us, which just made our outing even more fun! 

So glad we went back here! This place is on our short list of favorites in the east valley! You really gotta go....great wine...super freshly prepared food....gorgeous atmosphere...it's a winner!!
