ANHCo9X7zu0LdYecc9fk3Q Why does airport food have to be so terrible? Yes, we are trapped like rats, yes we are at your mercy but as a business offering a SERVICE, you should be taking your customers into consideration. Serving a sad excuse for a meal is unacceptable. Serving a sad excuse for a meal with an attitude, even worse. Suffice it to say my "Spinach Salad" was a huge disappointment. They basically dumped some spinach in a box with a few surprise bits of strawberry and mushroom (check out my accompanying picture.)

On the upside, this was the last real vegetable I was able to consume ahead of my trip to Mexico. Who knew?!
