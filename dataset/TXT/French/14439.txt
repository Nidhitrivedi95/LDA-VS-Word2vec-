5Bp8rQlvD44_W2lkcCc2vw Not your average hotel bar restaurant!  We were too tired to venture out our first evening, after flying in, and thought we'd have a quick snack at the hotel restaurant, with not so high expectations despite the snazzy decor.  We assumed it would be over priced hype- as lifer/native New Yorkers, we pride ourselves at being able to sniff that kind of stuff out pretty quickly-- but were happily surprised to learn Renoir is a real hit!

Excellent meal, service and sexy ambiance.  Be prepared for a splurge, and we suggest you sit in the bar area at one of the cocktail tables, rather than in the restaurant proper.  The menu is the same, but the vibe is another notch up, in terms of decor, atmosphere, and general coolness.
