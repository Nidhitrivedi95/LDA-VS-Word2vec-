aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw If you are into good french pastries and good coffee for breakfast, you'll get both at Bouchon bakery.   I tried their raisin pain and the latte.  The pain was surprisingly light and flaky, not too buttery although I'm sure it's layered with butter.  The latte was good but  I recommend 2 shots to balance out the milk.  You also must try the fresh squeezed OJ. Unfortunately, it comes in large size only but I finished most of it, it was that good.  For these 3 things, my tab was around $18, I think.  It's pricey but everything is jacked up on the strip.
I recommend the croissants, plain or chocolate.  I'm not a fan of the strawberry croissant.  It was mushy and too sweet (basically croissant topped with strawberry jam and dusting of powdered sugar).  I will not be ordering that again. 

Btw, there is a killer espresso place right around the corner next to Crispy Creme.  Do NOT order the espresso at that Illy gelato place.
