jLxeBgWhLRbII2ACkgH1Sg I have read excellent things about this place, and I was eager to give it a try. I wanted a quick lunch but something light. I chose the Caprese Salad, and then decided to pick up a few macarons for a friend's birthday the next day. It was somewhat pricey. The macarons are 2$ a piece, and there is no pro-rate price for buying a dozen. (That's ok. They were very good.) The Caprese Salad was 9.50$, and when I got home to eat my lunch, I discovered that it didn't include any of the pesto or balsamic that was stated on the menu. That was a huge bummer. I'm a fan of a decent Caprese, and for what I paid, I could have made it myself. The buffalo mozzarella and basic tomatoes were served on shredded ice burg lettuce. There were only small shreds of basil, that was starting to wilt. I had no problem with the service and my macarons were perfect. I will go back again to try a quiche and perhaps the Croque Madame before I form my final opinion.
