4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Had lemon pancake and salmon eggs Benedict. Wow. The pancake was amazing. The lemon flavor comes out of the thin, crepe like pancake! The eggs Benedict was cooked to perfection but mine had some egg shells and salmon scale still on it. For that reason, I am giving this place a 3/5
