eJ9L40jm5VOXCIq7xs9kQw We had the $78 tasting menu with the rack of lamb as the main, while my wife chose the prix fixe with the steak. 

Tasting menu portions were much larger than I expected, so there was certainly good value for the price while dessert was a struggle to finish. The hits were the shrimp and scallop in vanilla, the mushroom ravioli and the lamb. The rest, lobster bisque, foie gras creme brûlée and dessert were fine. 

Service was great (it was a weeknight, quite late, and a big party), and in particular they were very patient in letting us close the place down.
