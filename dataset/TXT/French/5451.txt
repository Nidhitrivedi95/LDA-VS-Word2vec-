3jKUbhGSjFTv5jZ0wnW0xA Here's to a nice little fancy French restaurant, easily accessible in the center of Montreal! At 6pm on a Saturday, our group of 7 entered the almost empty restaurant. The lights were dim and we were served by a friendly waiter.

The menu isn't too extensive, but the items on the menu aren't the common ones you'll find everywhere. I opted for the duck confit and tried some of the beef tartare. 

Just a note - you can get a french onion soup and a glass of house wine if you check in on Foursquare ONLY on Mondays - Thursdays from 5pm - 10pm. They budged a little for us. We had 3 check-ins but they were able to give us 1 special.

The french onion soup was delicious. Under a thick layer of baked cheese, you'll find plenty of onions, bread and a flavorful, spiced onion soup. This soup is perfect for a chilly day/night.

The duck confit was good. I wouldn't say it's too out of the ordinary. It's not my first time having duck and the way it was cooked was just like any other duck I would have. You'll find that the sliced potatoes on the side are much more interesting. They weren't too tough or soft - I enjoyed them more than the main itself. 

The beef tartare that I tried was good. It wasn't too spicy but the portion was huge. If I wanted beef tartare, I would opt for the appetizer instead. 

Overall, dinner wasn't too expensive and we all came out full. However, I would only come here once because there ought to be better choices around the area.
