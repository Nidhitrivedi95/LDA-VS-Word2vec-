LHwzyN5cllTfLuZ8v2k_Bg Le Paradis is one of my favourite go-to spots for French food. I have been frequenting this little neighbourhood gem for many, many years, and I have never once been disappointed with the food or service.

Restaurant is always busy, so I would recommend making a reservation in advance; you can usually make one the day of. The food is always consistent - my significant other and I usually tend to order the same items on each visit. I would highly recommend the Raclette as a starter: warm delicious melted raclette cheese tops seasonal vegetables. The Bavette and Pave de Boeuf are succulently prepared steaks, accompanied with frites and seasonal veg - all perfection. 

The service is always consistent and professional, the wines are delicious and reasonably priced, and the food is superb. Le Paradis is also an interesting people watching spot as it is always busy, and you will find different, interesting mixes of people.

Back and front patios in the summertime are quaint and charming, as is the bistro-esque seating area on the inside. Neighbourhood locals tend to frequent the bar area to have a glass of wine or come for a nice dinner and some engaging conversation with the staff. 

We have taken many out-of-town guests and clients to this venue and no one has ever been disappointed with the food, service and price. I would definitely put this on your list of little hidden gems to check out in Toronto.
