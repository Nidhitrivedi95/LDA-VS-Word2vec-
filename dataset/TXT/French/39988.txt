K64Uw3a2Enh2MznpwRHWKQ We came across a Groupon for Razz's so we decided to give it a shot. Where to begin?  The place is small yet very charming. Razz and his wife are very kind and hard to miss.

What matters most is the food and this place delivers.  We dine all over the US and this place can take on the best of the best. My wife loved the duck and I cannot say enough about the pork tenderloin. The ceviche is also recommended. 

We will definitely be back, thanks for a great culinary experience.
