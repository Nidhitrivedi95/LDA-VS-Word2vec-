JezHN-9KKLTMbojq00VP0g Solid brunch. Had a variety of food:

Steak & Eggs: Potatoes were good, eggs were good (small?), but steak felt like a rough cut and was really chew for a medium rare. Meh.

Strawberry crepes: Delicious, light, not overly sweet, and fluffy. Really great.

French toast: thick cut, crispy and fluffy, not overly sweet, delicious.

Croque Monseuir: Nice ham, crispy bread. 

Salt cod small plate: Really delicious, not overly salty or fishy, not overly oily and great aioli.

Overall, solid place.
