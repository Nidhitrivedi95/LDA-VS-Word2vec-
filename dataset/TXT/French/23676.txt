cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg Like the other hundred 5 star reviews here, this is a must try when in Montreal.  Foie gras and duck in a can seem to be the most popular dishes. Both are excellent and it's unlikely you will taste anything like it again.

The only thing I would like to add is that if you want to make it an interesting experience you may want to sit at the bar right in front of the kitchen. It is clearly much louder, but you are able to see how each dish is prepared.

Reservations are a must, however, if you do forget to make reservations just go there as soon as they open at 5pm and ask if you can eat at the bar. It does work.
