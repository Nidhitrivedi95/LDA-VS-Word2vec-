9ET_RUNztevq4_OLAX80Gg Came here for brunch with some friends.  Service was extremely slow and we had to remind the waiter we needed coffee.  A second disappointment for a Four Seasons Toronto restaurant (D Bar service was also poor on a separate occasion).  The brunch food was very good, however.  Two had steak and eggs, one had the eggs benedicte and I had the omelette.  Everyone enjoyed their meals and the food was very high quality (as we would expect from a restaurant of this caliber).
