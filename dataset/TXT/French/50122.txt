OVrNItYaf-AWNGgeJA1Tsw Came here because I saw the decor on Instagram. But the food and service is terrible. And to tell you the truth the decor is not as nice as in pictures. You find that there are a lot of home decor items that are not functional and annoying in a restaurant. Such as pillows, fabric, and the lighting hung in weird places. But back to the food. I find it over all very fatty and felt very unhealthy after leaving the place. Service was rude as hell. Trying to be a high end place but with low end food. Very expensive and the chef came out to check on us but didn't have the heart to tell him we were very underwhelmed.
