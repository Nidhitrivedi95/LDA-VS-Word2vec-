HOev_2CifUcfIm9xDL_uaw Très bien! Cafe Paris is a cozy little eatery across the street from Costco, serving sandwiches, soups, and salads. In addition to French style sandwiches, they offer paninis, and a few items that are Southwest-influenced (e.g., quesadillas).

I ordered a croque monsieur, and tried some of the French onion soup. The croque monsieur was everything I'd imagined this French lunchtime favorite would be. The bread was crispy and toasted, with some Dijon mustard, tender ham, melted Swiss cheese, with some melted cheese on top. The combination of flavors and textures was excellent. The French onion soup was served piping hot, with a generous serving of melted cheese on top. The flavors in the soup had a deep, rich beef flavor melded with some sweet caramelized onion. The side I chose with the sandwich- a "French taboule", was couscous mixed with dried cranberries. Unfortunately the couscous was a bit bland and a little gummy tasting to me. 

Service was warm and friendly. 

In addition to the indoor seating, there is a small outdoors area with 2 tables if it's nice outside and you want to eat in the sun. 

Until next time, à bientôt Cafe Paris!
