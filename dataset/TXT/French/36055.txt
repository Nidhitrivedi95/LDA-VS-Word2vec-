HYw-4ZwSpiVUQw-We4sPLw there's a girl more beautiful than the setting sun who works here... the food is irrelevant. this girl, my word, she makes me feel so little. like a little man. she has gorgeous green eyes like emeralds shining over cheekbones so sharp they would cut me were i to caress them. her smile radiates and intimidates and will turn the biggest jerk into a pathetic dweeb. she is probably God.
