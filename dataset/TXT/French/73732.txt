xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g Had reservations for dinner with my bachelorette party Friday night. I really loved going up the elevator in the tower and the view from inside the restaurant.

I liked that they had a decent small selection of beers, decided  to try something new and shares an appetizer with my friend 

We ordered the escargot. It has a good presentation and came out in a good amount of time. I really loved the little cakes that the escargot was served on.

I feel like the other servers could be a little more generous with the bread they serve with butter. I really liked the rustic bread. For my entree I has the duck with wild rice. It was perfectly seasoned and so tender
 This is somewhere I would definitely recommend and visit again
