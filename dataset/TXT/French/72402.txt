XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q Wow... Just wow. My fiancée whom is French loves this place. French people are really picky and me being from California, I'm a bit more relaxed and laid back. But this place was really impressive. 

She did 2 entrees and I did 3. We were so full after. We both did the wine pairing which is a must because they have some of the best wines in the world. 

The Margaux was amazing and the presentation and the service was top notch. 

Next time I think I'll just order 1 entree.

Great food and great service. Expensive but worth it.
