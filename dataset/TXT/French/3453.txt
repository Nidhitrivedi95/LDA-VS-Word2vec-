1idRJwqXxxmgSyQRKag4KQ I went to this place with a couple of friends.  We all agreed that it was just ok at best.

First off, the maple cocktail the waitress recommended was waaay to sweet.  It took me all night to finish because I kept having to add ice water to it to tone it down.  And the cocktails were quite pricey to say the least.

As for the food, I started with the beef tartar app.  I was actually sort of bland, so I had to ask for salt.  The potatoes that accompanied the dish only served to dull the flavour further.  The tartar I had at Le Select was much tastier.

For the entre, I had the scallops, king crab and drunken lobster dish.  The scallop was ok, but it was drowning in too much butter. The other stuff on the dish was sort of unmemorable...so much so I finish the dish like a robot and forgot what I just tasted.

I guess the hi-light of the night were the souffles we ordered.  They look impressive, and tasted pretty good.  I haven't had many souffles in the past, so I don't remember if they are suppose to be that "airy".  They were so airy that sometimes it was hard to taste anything because that big spoonful I just stuffed in my mouth was literally 90% air.
