4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Great French restaurant at Paris. Excellent food and service. Make a reservation as the wait was 45-60 mins when we arrived, thankfully we had reserved on Open Table and walked right in. Ordered the peppercorn steak, it was good. My girlfriend had the roasted chicken, that was also good. It's not  THE BEST French food but the price is great. We had a shrimp cocktail appetizer, two entres, all for under $70, that's a decent deal..
