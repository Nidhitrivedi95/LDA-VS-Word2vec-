0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g 2 Star Michelin Restaurant with Excellent Service. The waiters are soooo attentive.. always checking up on our glasses and plates, just the best service.

Must Get.. 

*Warm Quail Salad with sauteed artichokes & pinenuts 
- I chose this dish as my first dish for my prixe fixe but liked it so much that I ordered another one a la carte.. Same deliciousness x2

*Poached Oysters
- I'm not a oyster person but my bf and dad love this dish.. they will order 10+ oysters just for themselves so I'm sure it is phenomenal if you are an oyster fan

*Sautéed "A" Steak of Foie Gras 
-Best foie gras of my life-- just melts in your mouth literally... Great flavor and texture.

I had the prixe fixe menu- the waiter mentioned that I could substitute the main entree with Australian Wagyu Beef for $40 additional.. so I decided to trade in my roasted pigeon for some Australian beef! It was good...but I've had better..

Everything consumed here was delicious. This restaurant is the Best restaurant in Bellagio hands down.
