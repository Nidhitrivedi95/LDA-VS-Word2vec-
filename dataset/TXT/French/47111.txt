O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q We ate brunch on a Saturday afternoon. We sat out on the deck, with a view of Treasure Island and the Fashion Mall. My wife ordered the quiche, I ordered the American Breakfast, and my mother-in-law ordered the Seafood Alfredo. My wife's quiche was a small pie slice shape with a lot of pieces of long onion strips. The quiche was runny and didn't have much flavor other than the onions. My american breakfast had 3 eggs with one slice of bread. For 3 over easy eggs, I was left wanting more bread. The sausage didn't seem fresh, and the potatoes were bland. My mother-in-laws Seafood Alfredo didn't have any alfredo sauce, and everything tasted like the salmon that was in the meal. The fruit plate that we order was the best part of the meal. Pineapple, Cantaloupe, Strawberries and Honey Dew were the main items, with some blueberries, honey and yogurt to fill in the plate.

In short, we wouldn't go back. There are plenty of other places that are better at breakfast for a much better price. The place was almost empty and now we know why.
