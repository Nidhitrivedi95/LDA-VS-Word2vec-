mRrgBIT8vsYdI3YSfzCQhg The name, which is certainly not synonymous with "The Rain Forest Café", doesn't do justice to this restaurant's no-nonsense service and great food. Trust me, I hate fish. After one meal, this chef has convinced me that there's hope. I loved the atmosphere and that certain coziness that comes from have having dinner on a cold Saturday night in a restaurant with a full window view of Yonge St. This restaurant is one of up-towns hidden treasures.
