gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg Usual pub fare..nothing special here. I had the fish and chips and was rather disappointed ;more batter than fish. French fries were no better than the frozen kind that you heat in the oven. My friend had the chicken Caesar salad and she said it was ok .

Won't be bothering to return on next visit to Montreal
