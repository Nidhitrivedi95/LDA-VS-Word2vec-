USleI8g1UVN9-9jm-b4uIg I've eaten here a few times, but this review is more about the bar area.

It's a small area, but a nice place to stop in and meet a friend after work.  They do have bar bites, but will also let you eat from the full menu there.

I had the escargot (deconstructed with mushrooms) and some kind of meatball... I'm sorry that I don't remember the exact name of that, but they were both very delicious.

They have an extremely nice wine list.

Erica is the bartender and she was very nice and very professional.
