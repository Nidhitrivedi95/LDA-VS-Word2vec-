4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw The restaurant itself is nice and the service was great.  The baked cheese appetizer was really good, but very rich. I got the crab cake appetizer as an entree and could not even eat it, fishy and gross! My boyfriend got the salmon which I tasted, it was okay but nothing special.  Maybe we just ordered the wrong stuff but I really wasn't impressed :(
