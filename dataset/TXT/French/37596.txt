jA3xcba82t8x06H8NzG4VQ I led a group of 18 out-of-towners to The Black Pig on a Tuesday evening. The staff was fantastic about accomodating us. All courses arrived within minutes to all of us, no easy feat with that many diners.
The cocktails and drinks were as great as the staff. Folks raved about the steak, and they did look tasty. Following the recommendation of our waiter Lorainne, I had the pork chop. I come from Indiana, so I know pork. This was as flavorful as any that I'd ever eaten. (It was also the biggest chop I'd ever encountered!) 
By the way, after we told the staff of our monthly birthdays, they transformed dessert into a celebration. The chocolate dessert, while wonderful, was overkill.
I cant speak for solo diners or couples, but if you're in Cleveland with a-dozen-and-a-half colleagues, you'd be hard pressed to do better than TPB.
