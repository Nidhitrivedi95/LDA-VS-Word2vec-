ovtlrcsVRlgZZQUlHs_ovw Very disappointed to be honest.  The service was great but the food wasn't anywhere near what the reviews show.  I had the lasagna, my husband had the eggplant and we would never order the dishes again.  Cooked and served in a bowl.  Very hard to eat first off.  The noodles were over cooked in mine and both the dishes were mainly sauce.  I found the prices ridiculous to be honest.  The burgers looked good and I might go back and give them a try.  Perhaps Italian isn't their best dishes.
