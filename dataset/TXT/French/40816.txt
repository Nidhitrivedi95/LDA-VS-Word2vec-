kcF-en40P3J9L8nLy5lKqQ New ownership = bad news. At least in this case. For starters, they don't have oysters anymore which was always a huge draw for happy hour. I got over that and ordered a glass of Sauvignon Blanc, shishito peppers, grilled artichokes, drunken bread and my friend ordered the steak frite. 

My wine was brought out and it was warm. Not even room temperature warm but warmer than that. It wasn't the cool and refreshing glass of white wine I was looking for on a hot sunny day. Our food came out and the disappointments continued. They had changed the delicious lemony herb sauce that came with the artichokes. Now it's basically just mayonnaise. Also disappointing was the drunken bread. It used to be a fondue poured over the bread then cooked. Now it was cheese toast and I can make cheese toast at home, it's nothing fancy. Besides that, that waiter said they cut back and only use fontina now, no Gruyere and you can tell. The shishito peppers were good and my friend enjoyed her steak but if they don't get back to the quality they used to have, I won't be back.
