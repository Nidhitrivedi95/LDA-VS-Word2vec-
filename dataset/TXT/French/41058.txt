KcW_eVY0T0NSwlbXqUrRuw I went here for lunch, and ended up being one of the first people.
So in an entirely empty restaurant they put me right next to the cash register. 
It was so awkward to be sitting there with people constantly standing next to me, or leaning on the cash register (and into my personal space!).

The soup that day was fantastic, however, the veal I had in my main was very dry.
