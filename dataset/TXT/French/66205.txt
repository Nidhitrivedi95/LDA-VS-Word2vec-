Not surprisingly, the menu is Mexican-inspired, but it was nice to find an ambience that matched. There was a charming old-world feel to this little cafe that differentiates it from many of the cookie-cutter hipster brunch joints that have been popping up as of late. 

Our server was very nice, and took the time to help us make our brunch choices. Everything on the menu was around $10, which is pretty much a steal for a decent brunch these days. Traditional Mexican dishes like huevos rancheros, burritos, and tacos dominated the menu, but there were also more common breakfast offerings like eggs Benedict and omelettes for those not willing to venture out. I ended up getting a burger off the lunch menu, as recommended by our server. It was topped with guac, cheese, bacon, and chipotle mayo and the meat was amazing. Tasted more like a steak or prime rib burger than ground beef. They also let you get half fries, half salad for your side for those who can never choose or who like to have the best of both worlds. 

I highly recommend this cute little brunch spot, for its ambience as much as for its amazing food. The server mentioned that it can be hard to get a seat on the weekends, so don't be surprised if you have to wait but I assure you it is worth it!
