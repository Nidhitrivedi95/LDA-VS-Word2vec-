C3PVq7UpeHd6nz1_e-AtkA I was wandering aimlessly down the street when the smell of the food from this place drew me in.  The lovely waitresses were very nice and I have to say extremely polite.  I got the lobster ravioli and it was very very good at the time.  Got food poisoning after wards.......  I can't even say that it wasn't them that give it to me because it was my first real meal of the day.  I want to try this place again just because the actual dining experience was so nice that I can forgive them for poisoning me. LOL
