One of the top 5 best meals & dining experiences of my life. And most of the rest of those were in Paris.
Don't feel I can add any better info than what's already been written.

If you are going to complain about pricing, don't bother going. Do yourself a favor. Seriously those who enjoy a great meal & know it comes at a cost, don't want to hear it.  We get it.
