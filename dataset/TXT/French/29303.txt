EukD4hlPZXgSMpeya5iX2g A cute little family-run restaurant (a renovated house) with a super friendly owner and delicious food. 

I went here with my brother on a weeknight, and had no problem getting a table without reservations. But the place was pretty full, so if you have a larger group, then it may be difficult to just walk-in. 
We ordered the mussels as appetizers, and they were really good. The tomato-based sauce was perfect. I wish I had saved some of the fresh bread to soak up some of that sauce, but, alas, I had already inhaled it.
And then we ended up ordering a couple of the daily specials - braised veal with fettuccine and giant pasta shells baked with ricotta cheese and asparagus. Both were excellent. My brother especially enjoyed the bone marrow from the veal.

The only downside to this place is the service was a little slow (At one point, I think the owner forgot about us - she said she would be right with us and then just never returned), but I wasn't in any hurry, so it didn't really bother me.

Overall, I really enjoyed the meal and the prices were reasonable. I'll definitely be coming back to try out some more daily specials and dishes from the menu!
