eJ9L40jm5VOXCIq7xs9kQw Real deal indeed. Great food and especially atmo. Very subdued and relaxing air and lighting. The premium seats are right near the large above the street windows where you can observe occasional passers-by, a weirdo parking their car right in middle of street or a couple stopping having decided to kiss

Food is amazing. I had a tasty plate of scallops - very minimalistic, but perfect for late night not to over eat.
