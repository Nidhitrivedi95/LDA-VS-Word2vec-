fKDyiIcFLkl-_5d4JsvBXA This place only spécialise on one thing: the entrecôte! So don't go there for anything else, there isn't any.
This being said, this is one of the best meat I ever had and cooked to your desire. The fries are also perfect, the salad so fresh, the bread crunchy and the desert (profiteroles) not too sweet and full of flavor.
I'll return for sure on my next visit :-)
