HGDY8ZQkCmZ_d_OR_glSgA Terrible service and food.

I ordered veal meatballs and pasta. The veal was cold on the inside and I was never offered parmesan or fresh pepper. 

Service is slow and of the 3 waitreses that served our little section, none of them came to ask if everything was ok.

They took away our dishes and didn't offer us a dessert menu. We had time so we waited to see if they'll acknowledge us. 15 min later...one of them came by. 

Would not recommend.
