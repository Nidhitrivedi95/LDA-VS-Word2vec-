kIW8IeTV3W1tS_q_WAU4wQ I ate at the bar here on a business dinner; I am not a sophisticated eater but the menu was too fancy for my tastes.  They also serve the smallest glasses of wine I have seen.  The decor was great but for the price, I would expect much more (especially when NYC is a 1.5hr flight away).  My veal burger and glass of wine came to $40 pre tax and tip.
