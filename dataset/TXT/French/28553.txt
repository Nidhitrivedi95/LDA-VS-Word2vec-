ehRigNzlkRQlvhzKr7PLCQ I went to this restaurant for a birthday party after hours. The restaurant was quaint and had a fun vibe about it.

 For my meal, I had the chicken enchiladas with rice and beans. The chicken was seasoned nicely and the green sauce on top was tangy and had a light spice to it. Have I had better enchiladas? Yes. Have I had worse enchiladas? Yes. Would I drive across town to eat here? Probably not, but if I happened to be on sunset and needed to eat something good and reasonably priced I would hesitate to stop by. 

The owner has a great story about where she came from and why she opened this restaurant. You can tell she cares about the community and reaching out a hand to those less fortunate.
