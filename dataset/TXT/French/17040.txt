9ET_RUNztevq4_OLAX80Gg This is the place to go to if you're feeling fancy and want to eat deliciously made food. There is a good possibility you will see someone famous since it is located in the newly built Four Seasons Hotel (I ran into Tony Parker). But celebrity sightings come at a price.  This Sunday brunch is a 2 course meal at $42 a pop including fresh juice, coffee and tea. Choose from 9 menu items for the first course and 11 items for the second course. A mimosa or caesar will cost you $12. 

For the first course, I tried the buttermilk biscuits which were melt in your mouth fantastic and the chacuterie board. You can never go wrong with cured meats, cheese, pate and pickles veggies. Although it still doesn't beat other meat boards in the city.

For the second course, get the poached eggs which come with zucchini fritters and salad with a dill dressing. This dish had a great mixed of flavours but was still very light and refreshing. If you're look for something a bit heavier I recommend the duck confit hash.

I absolutely love the decor. Your eyes will feast on colourful graffeti-like artwork of Kate Moss,  Madonna and others.

Service here was impeccable as expected. The lady beside me complained about how her poached eggs were cooked and they quickly offered to make her new dish.  The manager even personally came to apologise and removed it from her bill.

The experience was great but it was one of the most expensive brunches I had in Toronto for 2 people.  Probably will come back again but will save it for special occasions.
