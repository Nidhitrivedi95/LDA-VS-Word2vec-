5fquJHY2hMX9tPRD5s0t5g Roosters is one of those kind of sure, it can't miss restaurants for romantic evening, social luncheon or business lunch meeting. Some of my personal favorites dip and corn Butterbean which brings out the country boy in me and their grilled-chicken chicken absolutely superb. Bruce is always also does an excellent smoked BBQ which leaves a trail down the street luring people to it. The definite crowd pleaser and many repeats coming from me.
