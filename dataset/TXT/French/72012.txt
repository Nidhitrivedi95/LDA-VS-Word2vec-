XI3iNUgChOfJk5ppjKVEQQ Please note : I can only comment on the drinks, staff, and ambiance of this place ;) we did not come here for the food on this particular night

As a group of three ladies in town to celebrate a 30th birthday, we were happy to stumble upon this place after getting the "no" vibe from Flygin (shady club) across the street.

Christophe is an amazing bartender and can literally concoct anything you feel like imbibing. He was witty, warm, knowledgeable, and friendly. I enjoyed all of the fancy drinks he created for us that evening, including "The Candice," a delicious blood orange cocktail, named after my birthday girl best friend. Be sure to order it next time!

The staff and owners here make you feel very at ease and welcome, and we spent a very long time hanging out and enjoying the AWESOME playlist. Seriously, the music was killer - a mix of old school hip hop, pop, and even some local Quebecois jams. We stayed until the wee hours and had one of the most fun experiences of our lives.

Thank you, Barroco, we intend to return next time and try the food!! ;)
