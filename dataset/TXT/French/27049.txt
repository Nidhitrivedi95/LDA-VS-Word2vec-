Dcj69NZJnbJhK-YHP_nULA There are two things wrong with BV: 1. you can't order a gin martini (only beer and wine), and 2. it is super small so any trip there will inevitably require a wait.  So why 5 stars? Because everything else is so phenomenal that these two things seem piddly by comparison.   They more than make up for the lack of a full bar with a great wine selection and even better beer selection.  And enjoying one or both of each makes the wait less onerous ;)  The food is always creative, prepared perfectly with only the best ingredients.  The service is always top notch - friendly and knowledgeable and professional.  

I know I said there were only two things wrong with BV, but really there are 3.  It's located in Madison, and I live in Milwaukee.
