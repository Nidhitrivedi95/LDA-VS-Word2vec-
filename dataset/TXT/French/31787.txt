grHISDkIGwttYthhW8DxCQ I used to live next to here and never would have thought they would make good crepes here because of how the place is situated. It's on the bottom of a building at the corner of sherbrooke and parc. You can see the place from the outside, but to look further in, you would need to crouch. When my friend visited me, she wanted Crepe and dragged me here..Then we kept coming every morning for 3 days straight. This has to be the best crepe I've had! From the ingredients the the entertainment of watching it being made. Every aspect of this place is great! Their portion sizes are pretty decent well. It was hard to sit. But it seemed more like a takeout place anyways. Regardless, these are some seriously good crepes.
