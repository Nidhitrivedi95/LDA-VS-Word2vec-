jA3xcba82t8x06H8NzG4VQ This was our first time at The Black Pig- a Saturday night dinner.
We were sat in the front where it was a cozy, intimate atmosphere.  The back of the place seemed a little quieter and open.

The cocktails were great! Both Pimm's cup and Specialino were interesting and balanced.

We started with the pork belly which was everything we had expected.  It's a fatty, juicy, pork bomb.  The homemade mozzarella complimented it nicely.

For entrees we had the porkchop and steak frittes. There was a significant lag time between the appetizers and the main dishes, maybe an hour.  We ordered another round of drinks and weren't bothered but it did feel too long. The porkchop was a good porkchop and I enjoyed it.  Whatever came with it puzzled me... It might have been the cocktails but all I remember is some cold, fried, green thing with melted cheese.  It didn't hit the spot.  The steak was cut into medallions and cooked just right.  The fries and garlic aioli were awesome. 

Overall, the service was attentive and the atmosphere was great.  Price was about right. We'll definitely be back to try more of the menu!
