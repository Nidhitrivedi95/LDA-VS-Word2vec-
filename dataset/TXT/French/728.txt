I preferred this place when it was an unassuming little bistro off queen & spadina. Now it has kind of a pretentious vibe. Man, they used to serve you bread in a basket they lowered on a string using an elaborate pulley-system! It was downright charming.

Yet another tragic downfall by venue-change.

Anyway, not a regular haunt anymore for me.
