aaWhSHpsE285eaSTzDxAMA I frequent Bistro 185 and shame on me for not reviewing before when I would be rating them 5 stars every time. The menu is spot on and atmosphere and service is always a nice change of pace for the typical east side establishments. But.... I am giving a 2 star review today so that maybe it will catch the managements eye. Service was slow, and had to be reminded several times, and it wasn't crowded. The sea bass was not good it was fishy and Texture was off, never should have made it to the table. Scallops also were not good and strange flavor. Maybe the kitchen was off? Maybe down some servers? The experience won't keep me away but I know it's under new management and the chef has put out excellent food in the past.
