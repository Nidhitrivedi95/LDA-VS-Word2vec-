vna49NPM-7B11tcFPTgnsg We came here after an afternoon of drinking at dieu de ciel. We had a charcuterie board, sweetbreads, rooster with cranberry, and the cauliflower. Everything was delicious but the portions are very small so don't come too hungry. The prices are not that expensive but considering the portion size, it adds up if you order a lot of plates. The sweetbreads were outstanding so make sure you order them. Also one of the pates on the charcuterie board was amazing. We could have eaten a giant block of that. Although the wine list was long, only a few wines were available by the glass. While we really enjoyed one of the reds, the other one we ordered was very acidic.
