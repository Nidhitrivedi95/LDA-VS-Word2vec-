BSmqxPbQglQwP2R56OqOag I want to like this place, really I do. But it has some hurdles to overcome to get that bump up to the 4th star. Went on a busy Saturday evening, had a reservation and had to wait about 20 min for our table. I give them thumbs up for handling the delay well as they offered my party wine to pass the time. I'm really mixed on the environment. Love the casual atmosphere with large industrial grade wine shelves surrounding the room and the updated blackboard specials. Did not really love high noise levels precluding normal conversation or the fact that practically everyone in the place looks like they have had plastic surgery. I might consider renaming the place the Botox Bistro. 

Wine list has plenty of options and most are affordable. Also, most are not marked up the typical 100% of other restaurants so they do get a thumbs up for making good wine accessible to the consumer. The menu is great in concept with lots of good choices for mains. The reality is that they had run out of the blackboard special by 7 pm and many of the items were heavy-handed on the salt. Tasty but with some basic flaws. 

I have to drop it down a star for the service. Our server was aloof, walked by our table numerous times without making eye contact to the point where finally we had to raise our hands and yell at him to get him to stop and take our order. There was no water refill and nonexistent wine service after the initial bringing of the bottle to the table. Yep, they were busy and it was crowded but this is the restaurant business and it was a Saturday night. Had they planned accordingly, they would have the 4 th star. Maybe next time.
