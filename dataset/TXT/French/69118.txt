w2tr0PA0b3tg8pId0kjM-A Ascetically, it's very pleasing. The nice clean lines found outside are repeated inside this French bakery. I love the red and silver exterior, it gives a modern look to the main drag of Forbes Ave in Squirrel Hill. 
All the white glove wearing 'Gaby Girls and Guys' were very friendly, greeting us with a pleasant 'Bonjour!' and smiling brightly while ringing up our $80 (!$!$!) worth of macarons and a pastry. 
The macarons are brightly colored yet subtly flavored. Some flavors are better than others. The sea salt caramel was a little disappointing, but the white chocolate basil, almond, and rose were perfect.
And yes, they do tip the scales at $2.25 for 1 with no discounts when you buy more. 
You pay for high quality, which is expected.
It was good to try once, and perhaps on a very special occasion, but Gaby et Jules is a little too pricey for me to become a regular.
