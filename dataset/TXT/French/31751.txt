We all loved our crepes, both savory (ham, egg, cheese and spinach) and sweet ( banana and Nutella). 
It is a very small place, but we found it to be very charming and the service friendly. The owner/crepe maker took great care with each crepe. It was like watching a craftsman. 
We went back two mornings in a row. On the second, his helper was late and we snuck in just before a large group of what appeared to be summer campers. He handled them as well as could be expected and everyone seemed happy to wait, knowing it would pay off. 
 And like another reviewer, my wife raved about the coffee. 
 We don't know when we will be back in Montreal, but when we are, we will be back.
