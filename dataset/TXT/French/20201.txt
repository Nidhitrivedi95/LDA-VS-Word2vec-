aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw I am a sucker for French macarons. I go to Bouchon every time I'm in Las Vegas, Yountville or Beverly Hills. No matter the wait, it's always worth it. Here's what I ordered:

Grilled Cheese Sandwich - No, I didn't come here to buy a grilled cheese sandwich. I was just starving so I wanted something small to hold me over until dinner time... plus, I'll never turn away from a grilled cheese. Note: They have to "heat up" the oven and that took ten minutes. What I really liked most about their grilled cheese sandwich was that it wasn't greasy! What I didn't understand was why they call it a grilled cheese if it's not grilled, they put it in the oven to melt the cheese. Anyway, I enjoyed it nonetheless. 

French Macarons - Yes, this was what I came here for!! I'm drooling thinking about Macarons as I write this. The Macarons here are bigger than the average size Macarons you buy anywhere else. I always get the Pistachio because it's my absolute favorite flavor. I also got the chocolate, vanilla, and their seasonal flavor; blueberry cheesecake. They're so light, fluffy and perfect. I was in macaron heaven!
