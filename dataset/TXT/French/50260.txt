ovtlrcsVRlgZZQUlHs_ovw My husband and I showed up the Tuesday before Thanksgiving with our two kids, in sweats! We had never been here before and knew we wanted to try it, so we came in not knowing what to expect (if we would have known, we wouldn't have worn sweats). Our waiter was Jason and he was AMAZING! He was attentive, but not overbearing, and, in my opinion, gave us the same service as the next table, despite how we were dressed. My husband had the meatloaf, I had the fresh pasta, my daughter had the beef skewers, and my son had the macaroni and cheese. All of it was delicious! I can't wait to go back for a quiet date night with my husband. It's right down the road from us. If you decide to try it, ask for Jason!
