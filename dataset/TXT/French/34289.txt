HL6ZzGF7V-KDaU0zziHyEA My family held a post-wedding brunch here, my first complain is that we were 30 people who wanted to be able to be seated close to each other but were all separated into 3 different groups, far from one another. The intention was for the two families to use this brunch to get to know one another and we were robbed of that opportunity due to the poor arrangement. In some areas the service was very slow, I asked for water with no ice and I did not receive it until after my appetizer was brought out. I ordered orange juice when the appetizer was served and did not receive it till almost the end of second course. In conclusion, this place has a nice ambiance but the food and service is mediocre for the price you pay.
