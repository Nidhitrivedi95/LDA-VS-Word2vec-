_pUSVvU43NkI8cMAzENCKg We tried this place recently, by way of a celebration for my Parisienne girlfriend's birthday. The food was nice- but you'd think we were in France from the service we got! I understand they have the 'Fawlty Towers' experience here, but you don't expect it all year round.

On arrival we were greeted- or rather not greeted - by the man who seemed to be the proprietor. He was rude in the extreme- only deigning to acknowledge our presence after a couple of minutes, and then making us stand around some more while he fiddled with something behind the till- even though our table was sitting ready for us. Waitress service was fast, but they never once asked how things were, or offered a smile.

Despite the above, however, the food was good, if not amazing. I had a starter of grilled goats cheese with chutney which was nice- but would have been better if it was warmed through. My main of a crepe stuffed with creamy spinach and mushroom filling was excellent, a lovely and rich with a well-made crepe. My girlfriend started with a seafood gratin and had braised lamb as main, both of which she reported were very good indeed. We finished with profiteroles, which were nice, but ordinary.

I understand the place does some good deals on lunches, and if the food is all you're concerned with I can happily recommend B'est. But the service, combined with a slightly too bright/open atmosphere that makes things very slightly too cafeteria-like, make it hard to suggest as a relaxing night out.
