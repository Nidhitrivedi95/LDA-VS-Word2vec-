B56AYe5GNuavMDtwFsXqzA Great restaurant for french food. We sat outside...which is noisy on a weekend. I suggest people try to sit inside.

Now....the food and wine was very good. Get the tartare and bouillabaisse! Tartare was some meat paste and a egg on top of it. The bouillabaisse is their seafood...only had one shrimp though. 
The fois gras was OK....also had the duck...which I warn it is medium rare...but still good. Get some full body red to go with it.

All in all very expensive.....so use this place for special occasions.
