0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g I went there with 5 other ladies as part of a friend's bachelorette extravaganza in Vegas.

I went with the Prix Fixe menu, starting with Warm Quail Salad, then Sauteed Ruby Red Shrimp, then the Braised Short Rib, and finishing with Concord Grape Panna Cotta.  (I also tried a few bites from my friends' meals).

The food was delicious, with good flavors and textures.  However, I never had that 'OMG-this-is-the-best-thing-I-ever-ate,' 'excuse-me-while-I-groan-in-ecstasy' moment.  Maybe it was the fact that I didn't have my favorite food-adventuring friend (my husband) with me, or maybe the dishes began to feel a little formulaic ('oh, let's add some crispy, fried bits to every dish to make the texture interesting').

The service was impeccable, however, and overall I had a wonderful experience.
