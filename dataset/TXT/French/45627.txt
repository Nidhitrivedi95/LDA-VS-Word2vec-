mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q My boyfriend and I went here for dinner on Saturday and the decor and open kitchen floor plan is OBVIOUSLY 5 stars. It's was gorgeous, unique, modern, and a fun, new interesting experience. Our server was so friendly and warm and kept us entertained.

We had the 5 course tasting menu for $95 each, and I have to say, I was a little disappointed. BUT disclaimer: I think French food is an acquired taste and I definitely was not used to it because I thought it was extremely rich and heavy, and I felt a little sick after my meal. Embarrassing but my stomach was not too happy with me after dinner.

One of the dishes, I couldn't even finish cause I started getting a headache, but our server was so polite and asked why I didn't finish and when I had told him, he offered to make me another dish to make up for it...and now THAT IS a 5-STAR service. Except, BECAUSE of the open kitchen, I saw him tell the chef that was there, and he made the most disgusted/shocked expression and I was honestly a little intimidated. But he did create another dish for me, which was delicious and less rich.

I LOVE cheese and I wasn't too impressed with the cheese plate, but like I said, I think everything on the menu is a very acquired taste like goat cheese. Not a fan of goat cheese, never have and probably never will, but a lot of people LOVE it.

Our server and maybe the manager? that was walking around and greeting guests even joked around with us which was awesome and made our dinner fun.

So I think service and decor is definitely 5 stars, but the food wasn't my cup of tea, so I'm knocking off a star. Definitely giving you a fair warning if you eat pretty healthy and lean everyday, prepare for a buttery, rich meal. Maybe it was the choice of the 5 course menu that was rich? I would definitely try something else if I came back!
