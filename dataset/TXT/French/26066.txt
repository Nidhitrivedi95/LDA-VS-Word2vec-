d482l58ho0_IMdFkXX1F5Q a stripped down menu of french classics with a lightly modern flair.... which is right up my alley.

a great somm, that is really passionate about what he does, and has some rare treats that are at a really reasonable price (he had Francoise Chidaine's Clos Habert from 2006 for less than 70 bucks, which is a phenomenal deal for las vegas). 

I had the:
French Onion Soup
Steak Frites
Cheeses

All three dishes were executed well, and were exactly as I expected them to be. The price is extremely reasonable (just $48 for 3 courses... to compare, I had a mediocre breakfast the next day cost me $32, so three great courses for $48 was great).

I can comfortably say that I will probably dine here whenever I am in town.
