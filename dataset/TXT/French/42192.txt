KZKbv0vLfW2al37QSu5ZwQ I was pleasantly surprised by this little French restaurant at the corner of St Paul and St Vincent in Old Montreal. We were visiting the old city and wanted to get a taste French cuisine before heading back to TO the next day.

While the prices were "normal" (as in moderately high) for French cuisine, I found the food quite good. I actually "sampled" everything that my family order and everyone had only good things to say about the food. I did't order any wine, so I can't make any comments on that. I had the veal, and I thought that is was cooked just right, and the sauce was fantastic. I even loved the roasted potatoes which they included as a side.

I wouldn't hesitate to make a return visit if I'm ever in Montreal again!
