xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g Very good setting, and romantic atmosphere. Be sure to ask for a window seat, the view is simply amazing. Especially the part facing Bellagio, they have free water works, where you can see very well in the restaurant :]

Food was amazing, we've ordered the warm foi gras,...yeah never had one so good. Lamb chop entree was cooked just right. Beef wellington...well, I don't know how the european enjoys their meat...wasn't really my cup of tea but nevertheless was well flavored. My and my wife ended the night with the souffle and a meringue, both was ultra delicious. 

Service was awesome, almost felt like a personal waiter standing by you. Also the washroom has a waiter handing out napkins...well i've never been to a high end restaurant that has that so this was interesting to me :P

The restaurant is ultra pricey but for its ultra tasty dish. Would recommend for a couple dinner. Doesn't feel like a family place...at least not worth it IMO.
