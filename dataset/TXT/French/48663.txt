ohMpNug5zWNxOlL6ShG7Ig Really cool restaurant in Carefree just up the road from Cave Creek. Wife and I were rolling through on a trip and stopped in for dinner. Seems odd to say this, but the french fries as an appetizer, with the special dips, are really really good. The truffle ketchup is the best.

We split a french onion soup and the staff was kind enough to split the order in two, including a piece of bread and melted cheese for each crock. The only downside of this is that it increased the concentration of gruyere in the soup, which is an extremely salty cheese, making the soup a bit too salty. 

Ordered the Polenta and Bolognese, which was excellent, if you're not in to veal you might want to order something else. 

We saved room for dessert and got the apple fritters, also great. The cider they served with it should be a standard beverage offering it was so good.
