6fPQJq4f_yiq1NHn0fd11Q My boyfriend and I had our fourth year anniversary trip in Vegas this November and stayed at Paris for a couple of nights.  We were so hungry we stopped by the restaurants near the entrances and front desks just to get a quick bite.  

Now, the two of us met at a creperie that we worked at five years ago, and we know our French and Japanese crepes pretty damn well - these quick crepes were flavorful and seemed to never be enough.  With total rewards card for Caesar Casinos, including Paris, you could save a dollar or so each crepe!  Never got to try a sweet one, but the savory pesto roasted chicken crepe is highly recommended.  The shrimp scampi crepe is super buttery and feels like it's coating my throat, but I wouldn't say it was a true ode to shrimp scampi pasta if it didn't!
