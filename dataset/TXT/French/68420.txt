vLkKorA1gPS97Zj0_WKA0Q Service and ambiance were good.  Food is below expectation for the price.  I had the 5 course tasting menu and I liked the John Dory fish dish.  Other than that, the other dishes were nothing spectacular.  The flavous were off balance and the ingredients quality were average.  I would rather go to L'Atelier de Robouchon which didn't have availability at the time I went.
