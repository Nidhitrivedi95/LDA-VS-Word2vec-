We went to the Joel a Robuchon in Tokyo, Japan and loved it so much, we decided to go to the one in Las Vegas since its relatively closer to home. Although I would say to Tokyo restaurant won in taste in all 3 courses, the aesthetics of the dishes in LV made it worthwhile.

Like the Tokyo restaurant, the meal starts off with your selection from the bread cart. We were too full last time in Tokyo to try this, and now I fully regret it. The bread was super soft and absolutely delectable when paired with extra virgin olive oil and their hand churned butter.

The appetizers were extremely good and we were glad to have ordered the menu where we can select 2 appetizers each. We ordered the grilled foie gras, sea urchin, lobster ravioli, and lettuce soup. The only dish that did not impress us was the lettuce soup; it was good, but nothing special. The entree we had were the duck with foie gras and ribeye with bone marrow. The ribeye was seasoned too salty for my taste but the duck was perfect.

The dessert was unbelievable. In addition to the chocolate soufflé and orange caramel cream, we can select from a variety of bite-size desserts!!!
