-unEKbRspO6OuEaPdmRywg Our trip to Montreal and Le Saint James Hotel was nothing short of perfect.  High praise indeed, coming from a very discriminating guest.

Breakfast at XO was nothing short of happiness.  Our trip to Montreal was one to explore the food and culture.  The chef and team truly understand what it is to prepare food properly.  Silver table settings, hot plates, eggs cooked to perfection, braising the ham in broth and toasted coconut on the banana pancakes.  Each evening Nick would proclaim at dinner "I can't have desert, I have to leave room for breakfast".  As a New Yorker and culinary enthusiast, I was truly pleased and have to admit, breakfast was a highlight of my trip.

Not only do we adore Montreal, but we truly appreciate the attention to detail and professionalism of the staff.  We will absolutely be returning and truly thank Le Saint James for being a contributor to our amazing weekend.
