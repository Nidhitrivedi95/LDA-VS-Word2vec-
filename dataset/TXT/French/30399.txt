FUX9h1a37GJn9ge1baiNuw It's obvious that their food is delicious. I've had only a few experiences there but have always had delicious experiences - baked bread, pastries or quiche. However... If the hours are stated online AND on their front door that they open at 7:30am, then they should open at 7:30am!! I made plans to meet a coworker there before work promptly at 7:30 and the lights were off, chairs were stacked on tables and there was no evidence that anyone was there. This is terrible for business; I know that I will never make plans to go there for breakfast again. This was not the first time this happened, so I've learned my lesson. (I gave two stars for the food being awesome, but it doesn't do any good if I can't even get to it...)
