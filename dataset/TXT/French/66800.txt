UpEVdq_euH-5mqCIgUAd2Q Didn't want to pay roaming charges in Canada so we were lost on what to eat because we couldn't Yelp! *gasp*

So we stumbled down Front Street and found Le Papillon.  It's such a large restaurant that when we walked in we were a little skeptical about the food because it seemed way too commercial and not very cozy.

Our fears melted away when we were greated with a warm smile and BREAD!  Nothing makes me happier than to to be greeted with bread and butter at a restaurant.  I love bread and butter, especially if it keeps flowing throughout the meal....

We ordered Camambert Frites with cranberry sauce which is their version of a fried cheese and it was yummy.  Light brown and crispy on the outside and gooey on the inside.  Dip into the cranberry sauce and you have a tasty treat before your meal.  They're tiny though, but perfect since we weren't looking to stuff ourselves.  For our main we shared the mussels in white wine sauce small as well, as both the Camambert and mussels came from their brunch appetizer menu.  The mussels were absolutely fantastic!!  The broth was rich and had a great lemony herb taste and the mussels were plump and gorgeous.

The food was great but the best part was the great service.  Our server kept our coffee cups full and kept the bread coming and she was sooo friendly and super sweet.  Will definitely go back when I visit Toronto!
