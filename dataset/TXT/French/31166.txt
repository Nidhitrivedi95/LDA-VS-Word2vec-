ggIWkJtgXHKnhdxRu338AQ Had a lovely and pleasant Summerlicious dinner. Very attentive servers and super friendly staff/ owner(s)? kept coming by to check on us. Food was delicious! Nice atmosphere and decor, quiet location (away from street traffic). I was most pleased with the service, it was excellent. Will be back!
