pmoIMK8zGWvKsVOPDBYfzg Fantastic dining experience!!! Formal dining with a lot of frills. 

Food was amazing!!! Each dish was cooked to perfection. We ordered pan seared foie gras. It was to die for!!! Slightly cripsy on the outside. Soft, melt in your mouth on the inside. The rich duck taste lingers on your palate after you have finished your bite. There was a dish that wad referred to as sweet bread. Also very very delicious!  

They give you a small bite of sorbet to cleans your palate in between the courses. Lobster was the best I have ever had. Scallops were perfect. Steak wad a soft juicy medium.  Venison was also perfect. 

We ordered the rocky road souffle which was also very tasty, but I rave the most about the foie gras. 

The entire dining experience was superb! My life is complete now that I have experienced French fine dining. :P  Well worth the four $$$$.
