K64Uw3a2Enh2MznpwRHWKQ I have to hand it to my husband.  I'm the Yelper, yet he managed to find a place for my birthday that I did not even have bookmarked.  As we pull into the strip mall, I'm thinking "Oregano's? Really?"  But it was Razz's!  And the Chef's Table (more like a counter) to boot!  Be prepared to get to know those next to you as seating is very tight though.  

As many small plates you can handle (I handled 7, thank you) for $10 a pop.  One of my favorites was the seafood beggar's purse with a red chili sauce, but truthfully, I loved all but the last (I really never know when to quit).  Several of the dishes incorporated southwest flavors which is a huge plus for me, too.  And Razz was a delightful host assisting us with wine selections to complement the varied menu.

Would definitely do this again, but maybe with fewer courses.  By the time 7 rolled around, I was rolling around.
