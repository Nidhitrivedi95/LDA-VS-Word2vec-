BSmqxPbQglQwP2R56OqOag Like everyone else we went for the drunk bread! It was definitely worth it...nothing beats cheese, bread, and wine, let alone all combined in to one. Delicious.

We also had the mushroom pizza which I'll admit sounded better than it was. It was still good and even better when dipped in their rosemary ranch dressing, but I can't say it was anything special. 

For a Thursday night the place was packed, which is always a good sign and I get why. It's a warm and inviting atmosphere with good food. I would definitely go back, especially to try the bottomless mimosas on the weekends!
