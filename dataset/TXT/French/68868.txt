vv7HKwsG6tloU4xho7QUBQ L'Artichaut is a fantastic place to eat with a very friendly, relaxed atmosphere. A group of us arrived, excited by recent reviews of how good this place is but also curious how we, 5 very non-vegetarians would cope with no meat. The manageress was aware of our carnivore ways and we agreed that we would all order a different course so we could try a forkful of each. The choice, the presentation and taste were all amazing and all washed down with vegetarian wine (you learn a new thing every day). We had a terrific time here. The great food and informative, easy going staff made this a really enjoyable evening.
