9ET_RUNztevq4_OLAX80Gg This is my favourite date night/casual splurge spot! 

I've been here for summerlicious, winterlicious, brunch, dinner, etc. and they have never disappointed. 

Before I get to the food, let me just say that they have the best service. I've never had an empty glass, nor a dirty plate on my table for more than a minute. They were incredibly friendly and didn't push to get another bottle of wine and anything like that. 

Now, in terms of the food. It's great! From their epic charcuterie board, beef tartare, boudin blanc, crispy duck, soufflé, madeleines, etc. I've never been disappointed. I think some people forget the fact that the man who owns this restaurant is a legendary, 3 Michelin star chef.

If you want to impress your significant other or have some leftover from your bonus, definitely head to Cafe Boulud.
