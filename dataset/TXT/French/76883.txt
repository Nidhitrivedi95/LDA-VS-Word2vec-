ysJo5Jdo29XOBCnKrbUKWg This restaurant really reminded us of dining at a restaurant in Paris. The atmosphere has the laid back French vibe, complete with a French waiter. He even started talking to my boyfriend in French!

Service: There was a relaxed pace and food was not rushed out. Our waiter did a great job of being attentive without hovering. He was great at knowing what we needed and when we asked, he would be right back out with it.

Food: The moules-Frite were okay. The fries were perfect but the mussels were lacking. The escargot was amazing, as was the beef bourginon. The creme brûlée was okay, I think the chocolate mousse was better.

Cocktails: They were great! Definitely recommend the French Manhattan.

Price: It was definitely a little bit of a splurge but overall not that bad considering what we had. Definitely less than flying to Paris for experience.
