fyJAqmweGm8VXnpU4CWGNw Unhappy employees, chef was a jerk, server didn't communicate to us that our food would take almost an hour to come out, we kept asking what the status was and they kept saying 5 more minutes. Don't come here hungry. Another customer had to wait 45minutes to get 3 fresh beignets and the staff didn't communicate with her either. The place is hot and stuffy and all the employees look unorganized and unhappy. I saw an employee go from helping a customer at the register to cutting cheese without washing hands or sanitizing. BEWARE! It's unfortunate that the grace and kindness from actual French people doesn't exist here, looks like all the employees are locals who work in the kitchen without an apron or hairnet, how about food safety concerns??!!! Get it together French Grocery!
