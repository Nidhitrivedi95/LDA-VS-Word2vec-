4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw i made reservations for late 4th of july dinner. we were seated quick, the restaurant looks nice, dim lighting, you get the view of the water fountain and the strip. we ordered the raw oysters, escargot , almond trout and the seared scallops. the oysters tasted good but were on the small side. the escargot was just ok. the almond trout tasted like something i could have easily made. really nothing special at all. the seared scallops were ok they were a bit on the cold side and were small. the food was just ok and it really is not worth the price at all. the service was ok.
