SFnrHuVFSNiondFVUBLJZQ Old Montreal...you are a delight to the visual sense.

-Delice Special: Scrambled eggs, bacon, ham, swiss cheese, mushrooms, and MAPLE SYRUP!!

As you can tell, I am ecstatic about the maple syrup. Whats even better is that the bacon is ham-like, lean, and very filling. 

Only regret it that I didn't get a chance to try a dessert crepe. Shame on me!
