gjCmXkMNVE0JSk8puUwv6g So I read another review and literally laughed out loud bc I have also driven by thinking "oh no another doomed restaurant" I have gone to swish next door a 1000 times (also amazing food) and have seen this restaurant change so many times. I HOPE THIS ONE STICKS man this food is good. Had to try the broccoli guacamole, it was surprisingly good. Going to try to make that at home. But the QUICHE LORRAINE was off the hook. Wow. My friend had the seasonal steak salad and it looked amazing she said it was great. Owners were very nice as well as staff. Try it out for sure. Great place!
