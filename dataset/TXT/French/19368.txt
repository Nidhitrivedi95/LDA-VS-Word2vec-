aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw I almost had a coronary when the girl in front of me ordered the 'Kanye Amen.'  No one bothered to correct her, thankfully, because it was a line of about 8 deep, I was next and truthfully, the extra seconds of pleasantries weren't really going to make a difference.  I mean if you go around calling pastry, 'Kanye,' there is no hope for you.    So without comment or expression from either me or the cashier, I ordered my kouign amann--pronounced 'queen a-mon'--and it was awesome.  The crunch from the caramelized layer of sugar that lined the bottom, the buttery sweet layers in between and the pastry with just enough give to make it soft yet light and decadent at the same time....I should've ordered this everyday; how often do you have Bouchon just an elevator ride away.
