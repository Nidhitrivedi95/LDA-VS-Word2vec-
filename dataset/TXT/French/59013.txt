It's like they're all paying attention to you.  This type of customer service should be followed by other restaurants.  Everyone from the Host to the Busboy, are so pleasant and professional.

We came in 3 weeks ago for our anniversary.  They had our table set with the Happy Anniversary note.  It's a little thing but makes one feel special.

We had delicious Martinis but unfortunately, lost my receipt and can't recall the names.  They were both delicious!

The meal began with palette cleansing gelatinous starter.  There were several breads to pick from.  I'm not a bread person but my husband loved bread! Even I loved my bread with bacon and cheese.  

We ordered...
Lobster Salad
Hamachi Salad
Rolled Seabass (we both had that)
Chocolate ball with Hazelnut middle
Red Velvet with creamy cheese

I can't say enough about how fantastic our meal was.  Everything was fresh and perfectly prepared!  My mouth is watering thinking about the delicious concoctions they prepared.  The plating was beautiful and my dessert was a piece of art!!!  Literal piece of art! Looking forward to coming back on our next trip to Vegas.

In the end, they offered complimentary sweets while we handled the bill.  

If you're looking for a great place to celebrate a special occasion or a nice dinner, this is absolutely the place for it!  The restaurant is intimate and the service is amazing! 

It's a must try in Vegas!
