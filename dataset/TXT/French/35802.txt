hvjgF-vnPw2jyL5DBuB0qg We got lucky.... 
This was a last minutes trip but we were trying to book about 2 weeks ago.  They were fully book but we went to try again since plan changed. Lastly we got to a last minutes cancallation at the bar for just an hour.  We ordered some seafood (oysters, scallops and razor clams) and a mushroom toast as
 appetizer.   Season selection as great and the best it the freshly graded horseradish was amazing.  The 2 hot sauce that they paired was a hiden gem.  Specially the one called the holy hot sauce; it was chunk's own sauce.   It was well balance with jalapeno and the acidity.  I bought one home and my parent said it goes with meat better than seafood. We got 2 main course: pork loin with mushroom and salmon with squash.  
The loin is one of the best I have ever had.  Soft in the middle paired with buttery oyster mushroom.  The salmon is great but we find the it is a bit too sweet for us.  
An advice is to order a bit more than your regular order.  Their portion is a bit small.
