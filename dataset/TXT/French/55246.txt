rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Been here for the 4th time for breakfast.

Exterior: inside the Venetian Hotel. Really pretty and looks nice.

Interior: Always clean and busy. Bright lights shining in from the pool and overall, a pretty place to eat at but not a quiet place.

Service: nice host and server. Server always asked us about our meal and refilled water for us. She seem to know a lot about the specialties of the day and was really caring.

Food: food here for breakfast has been the same over the past few years I came here. Either egg, muffin, waffle, sausage, etc. 
Got the sorted pastry and that was good. 4 big pastry is satisfying for one person. The pain au chocolate was fluffy and crispy. The sticky pecan bread was tad bit sweet. The blue berry muffin was good. Really wanted to try the fruit tart but they ran out. -sad face- but it was only 10 am though. 

Sausage and egg was one of the specialties of the day. Sausage was too salty. Did not like.

Hanger steak and egg was another special dish of the day. Steak was perfectly cooked to medium rare as asked. Looked dark on the outside but perfectly soft and red inside. 

Terrine foie grass was interesting. First time trying it. Basically like 6 small strip of bread and a small jar of foie gras and another small cup of salt. Spread the foie gras onto bread and done. Too little amount of bread though. I ended up taking breads from the other dishes my family ordered to add with the foie gras. For $25, that's very little for a big price though. If you never tried it, it's worth trying once. 

Overall, the place for breakfast is not really my thing (or any place for breakfast, in my opinion) but it's still a good place to eat and chat at. A good place to eat and easy to go to for Venetian guests.
