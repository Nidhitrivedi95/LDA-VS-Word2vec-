Le Passé Composé is the place to go. They recently moved ...the new looks is way more clean and modern aesthetic there as the old location was a more homey feel. 

The only problem with this place is that you might have to go back to bed afterwards and sleep it off. 

I've had most of the items on the menu and nothing is bad, but here is the underdog that a waiter once enlightened us with: two sandwiches that get over looked: The Grilled Cheese Gaspor and The Innovative Grilled Cheese. My fiance and i now order a Croque-Madame or one of the Poached Egg dishes and split it with one of the Grilled Cheeses, trust me you will not be disappointed! 

The hours are super limited. So this is not a recommended Sat or Sun brunch its so crowded and you have to be there early. What i recommend is if possible go on a weekday.
