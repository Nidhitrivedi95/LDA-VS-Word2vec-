JezHN-9KKLTMbojq00VP0g Not sure what I can say about this adorable little cafe that hasn't already been said. So, I'll keep it short to five points.

1) It's cozy. You'll want to take off your coat carefully so you don't inadvertently smack another diner in the face.

2) The Pomegranate Iced Tea is all sorts of awesome. Get it. 

3) The menu is nice and diverse from sweet crepes to plenty of savory options. There's something to satisfy anyone. 

4) The Chicken & Chutney crepe was a fantastic consistency and filled hunks of bird and topped with a flavorful but almost too sweet chutney. There's a large pool of the sweet stuff on the side - go easy. 

5) Service was efficient but not overly friendly. This didn't rub me the wrong way per se, but if you're seeking that super welcoming neighborhood spot, I didn't get that vibe from Le Petit Triangle. 

In terms of crepes, Le Petit serves 'em up right.
