Tefx_N6A6nrsdj4jHHnbYg This delightful new French Café is a welcome breath of fresh air to the south west Vegas community. Charmingly hosted by warm and friendly staff, the atmosphere is classically European and beautifully decorated.  One of the best café lattes I've had in Vegas with beans provided exclusively to them by black drop coffee beans.  I had the Turkey apple and brie baguette with a salad which was delicious. The homely smell of freshly baked biscuits and breads will make this new Las Vegas gem a regular drop In for me! Well done Le Petit Café.
