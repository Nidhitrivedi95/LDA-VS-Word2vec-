kGOr_D-LNpgZ2M9N8TT4QQ One of my favourite restaurants in Toronto! Make sure when you go you put on the Ritz or else you will feel really out of place, the ceiling in the main dinning room is STUNNING, there is always champagne on ice right in the dinning room so you do not have to wait their wine list is extremely extensive. The food here is excellent, love, love, love their steaks! They also have a delicious seafood bar that will just make your mouth water! The bar area is cozy, very very french feeling every where you go in this restaurant, the only real criticism I have of this restaurant is that it is a french restaurant that plays North American music? I wish they played french music!!! This restaurant is definitely not kid friendly even though they have a kids portion on the menu. Make sure you make a reservation! Overall an excellent restaurant, perfect for your regular haunt of a special evening with your girlfriend/boyfriend or out with friends!
