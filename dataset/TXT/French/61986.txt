STX8NfaW_xP6YZq-wERHYg lovely small french restaurant, mostly crepes plus specials.  had dinner on a friday, really good, nothing too elaborate but everything was done with care and expertise.  the owner-chef lady is a delight. there was a wine tasting event, extra bonus, which was a steal, a generous 4 flight for $10.  there will be lines out the door if/when this place gets discovered.
