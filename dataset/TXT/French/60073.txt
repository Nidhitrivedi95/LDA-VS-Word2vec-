sARavfidmIS878q5BtlyVQ What a meal and evening! A truly spectacular dining experience! My wife's Christmas present was this meal, so we planned our Vegas trip around it. 8:30pm showtime and then we headed back to the dining room inspired by Jose Andres' brain. From there the delicious successes started coming from the 'kitchen' - literally the chef's table is directly in front of the guests. Getting the opportunity to discuss the courses with the Chef team was a highlight!

Memorable dishes included: Crispy chicken skin, zucchini in textures and so many more.

See all of the courses and a description of each on my blog: http://sprtzcstr.blogspot.com/

Highly recommended and worth every penny.
