mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q I never dropped this much on one meal but damn, it was a good meal. The waygu beef steak was easily the most amazing steak I've ever eaten, made from fresh, juicy Australian beef. And watching the chefs was a total delight. Every course was better than the last. I was so disappointed the night before, when I went to Studio B Show Kitchen at the M Resort. Tonight's experience erased all of that. Amazing. Simply amazing.
