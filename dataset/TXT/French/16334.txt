7Ug8zCmY6iDTewxWqeYQ2g My top option for an authentic French "bistro" food in Montreal that does not break your wallet by BYOW! Why call it "bistro" rather than "gastronomy"? Despite the constant efforts to innovate on flavors and decors, the dishes that taste like french "grandma's cooking" always win, and they may not succeed as well on their creative side: 
1st service: Cauliflower cold soup (creative side fail): I agree with previous comments that 'i'd better have it warm'. I've had many innovative cold soups / gazpacho before and this does not enhance the flavors or give any interesting texture when serving cold
2nd service:  Duck tartare (traditional side win): shallot, moutarde, wine sauce- totally classic and totally satisfying!
3rd service: Rabbit (traditional side win): Like grandma's cooking, it contains lots of "Love" = butter+salt+wine+butterrrr. If you're looking for gastronomy, you may say "a bit too dry, too salty and heavy". For me, it is actually super satisfying, especially when paired with a glass of old Bordeaux. 
4th service: Chocolate mousse (win/fail- too full to tell)! At this point, i've been sitting and eating for over 3 hours!!! So the service is on the slow but bearable side, just don't plan anything afterwards besides walking some calories off!
