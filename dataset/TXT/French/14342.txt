58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw Went here for an early lunch. I thought it was quite good. My bf and I ordered sandwiches - grilled chicken and a roast beef. The grilled chicken was better than the roast beef. The real star of the meal was the carrot salad. It had this unexpected ginger flavor with some dried cranberries.
