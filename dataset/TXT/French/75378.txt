YAWHQEPJxpfCwT8e0Urofg A pleasant evening in Monkland Village while visiting our daughter. Ate outside under umbrellas on a pleasant porch--Le Maistre is located in an old house on Avenue de Monkland.  The steak frites was marvelous--cooked just right, and not a soggy frite on the plate ( how rare is that?) As an American resurrecting rusty French, I experienced the kindness of the server, who continued to converse with me in French, though I'm sure it would have been easier for both of us if we had continued in English. 
Our desserts were excellent--one was a creme brulee, and the other some kind of bread pudding.  Would return in a second!  Americans, beware. Due to no fault of their own, the restaurant must charge a heft tax, which ends up adding 12% or so to our /your bill. Not counting gratuite, which you will want to leave.  What can you do? Be prepared for sticker shock.
