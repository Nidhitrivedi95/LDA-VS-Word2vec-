cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg So walked in at 5:30 on a last Sunday of the year that they were going to be open. Needles to say madness !!!! Our reservations were lost however the hostess was exceptionally good at getting us a table without any fuss. Once seated we were warmly greeted by waiter... our new friend for the night lol! He was not only extremely well spoken in English but also very patient taking his time explaining each and every dish multiple times even though there was a line out the door. We started with awesome
Cocktails c'mon who can pass up a poached pear in maple syrup yummines! We then went on to the marrow with beluga caviar and fresh bread , and foie gras pasta almost like a ravioli.... IT WAS PURE ART! Then onto the main course which was out of this world ! Cassoulet was made to perfection! I must say if one watches Anthony Bourdain you will know
what I mean when I say we had a Bourdain moment of meat sweats shots more meat sweat more shots followed by beer and dessert but most of all awesome service from the wait staff who drank with us and laughed to no end.  Well worth it!
