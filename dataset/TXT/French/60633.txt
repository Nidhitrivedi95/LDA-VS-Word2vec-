SCklYa_jhihWAcfIn-_chg I met family here for brunch on the weekend.  I had the baked french toast - it was delicious!  The place is very quaint - definitely feels like you are in Paris!

I would describe this place as a definite A-OK.  I wouldn't give it any higher due to my personal tastes. My issues are that it's cash only, very busy and very loud.
