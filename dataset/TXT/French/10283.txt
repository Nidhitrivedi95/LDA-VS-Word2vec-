4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Great brunch spot! Food is delicious and always elegantly served. Had Slate for the first time here very light, tender and flavored well. The ambience is very posh and with the high ceilings and large windows you really do feel like you're somewhere in Paris. The Pavilion with sky window ceilings and the outdoor patio seating are my favorite and give unbeatable views of the strip and the fountain shows at Bellagio. A must visit dining experience at least once!
