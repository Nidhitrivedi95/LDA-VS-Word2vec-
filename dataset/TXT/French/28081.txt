E2vRShw8WVt6zfugz-gwPQ Excellent casual fine dining that's close to home. Typically if I wanted to have some upper scale food I immediately think of downtown Toronto. Well, no more downtown for me. 

I had been here 3 times so far, all for celebrations. I do have to say the wait times for the actual food was a tad bit longer than I like but the food and service makes up for it. 

The lamb: so melt in your mouth tender and the pairing of the potatoes was devine.

The duck: cooked med-rare, the meat was so rich and yummy. I can only describe as "drool"

The Chatter rib: spiced well and quite beefy. The meat is fork tender and falls right off the bone. 

The service is amazing. The last time we went we ordered the mussels and requesting to be cooked with the marinara sauce and when the dish came it was sauced in the Thai curry. We brought this up to our server's attention and she immediately put in an order for a new one and had us keep the curry one as well. 

Will return here again and again. 

Thumbs up all the way!
