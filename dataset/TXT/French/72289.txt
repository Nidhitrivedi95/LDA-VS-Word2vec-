XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q Joel Robuchon is a good restaurant, but not a superior restaurant.  When I go to a 3 Michelin Star restaurant for the first time, I expect the meal to be filled with wonder and amazement.  My expectations were not met here.  I will say my Michelin Star restaurant experience, prior to coming here has been limited to most of the places in NYC and a few blocks away at Guy Savoy (which I feel is a better restaurant).  

I had the 16 course tasting menu and everything was beautifully plated, but I did not have 1 "WOW" moment.  I also didn't understand the egg dish.  It was just a rubbery poached egg that was VERY round.  

The bread cart was nice, but not superior.  The only item I felt like they did an exceptional job on was the full sized baguette, but at the end of the day, I didn't pay a large sum of money to eat bread.  I have the same comments about the dessert cart.  My plate was filled with items that I only nibbled on.  There was not one item I felt compelled to finish.    
   
The previous sentence sums up my feelings on Joel Robuchon, it is nice, but I do not feel compelled to return.  

Service was very good and decor was definitely the best out of any restaurant I have ever been in.
