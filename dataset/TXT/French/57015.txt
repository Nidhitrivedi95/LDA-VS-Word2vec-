rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I thought this place was decent, but for it's price I'd expect something more amazing. We asked them what their most popular dish was and they said TROUT. Yeah, we were surprised too! But it ended up being the best of the selection we ordered, which included Chicken, Lamb and Salmon. 

I'd probably rank the dishes as follows: Trout, Salmon, Lamb, Chicken. We didn't try the Mussels, though after seeing the table next to us order it, we wish we had.
