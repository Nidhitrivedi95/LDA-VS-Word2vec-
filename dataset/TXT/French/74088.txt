xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g I always have trepidations whenever I eat at a restaurant whose main attraction is that its inside a major attraction at altitude.  It seems that half the value of the meal is on the view (in this case, the Bellagio water show), and it's at the expense of the service or the food.

I was delightfully not disappointed on either count by the Eiffel Tower Restaurant.  Highlight of the evening was our indulgence in a delightful chocolate souflee (order at the beginning of the meal, 30 minutes to prepare).  The wine list is probably too large for your average tourist to comprehend, but our waiter was patient as a trained dog in helping my godmother choose a wine from the list in the dim light.

Their bar also knows how to make a fantastic sidecar with bourbon.  Got me hopped enough to play a spin of roulette (Won $10 on black).

Service was a bit slow in mid-meal, but I give our server high marks in geniality.
