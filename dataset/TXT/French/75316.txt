y6rN3pUCfOkq41_m3Bk2nw I came here for dinner one evening with my family and had the angel hair pasta dish (Angel hair with grilled chicken, sun-dried tomatoes, red onion, roasted garlic in a light olive oil-herbed tomato sauce). The dish was very good; however, I found the sauce to be a bit too salty for my liking. 

Service was good and the waiters were knowledgeable and attentive. It is a lovely, sophisticated, and relaxed restaurant that caters a bit more to the older generation.
