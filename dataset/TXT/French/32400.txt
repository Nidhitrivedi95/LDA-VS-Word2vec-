gxMa7j1LXIUxxBoP0osDpA The only reason I am withholding the 5th star is because the ambiance was a little tough. Our table was wedged between two others and up against the kitchen - not the most romantic location. The restaurant was very loud (hard to hear conversation across the table) and very dim. However, the food.... It was entirely worth everything previously stated for more of that! Everything ordered was a good life-choice. Everything was fresh, everything was divine - even the water tasted good! Highly recommend...well it all changes based on fresh foods, chef's opinion, and whether you can read French. So, just order what sounds appealing, it will be great!
