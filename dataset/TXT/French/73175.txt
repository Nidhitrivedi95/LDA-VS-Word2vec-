xNnZ5ksBY1gwwTV2Btb4Ag Absolutely amazing for a group of guys on a bachelor party looking for a great meal without the snooty white table cloth. Just great meat and seafood dishes with excellent liquor drinks. Great wine list but skip it unless you are ready to drop a lot because the more economic bottles (under 100) are not the best quality.  But great for large groups and many things you won't get in the states. Part of the best night of our trip! The staff treated us very well and were in top of all of our needs. Allow for atleast 2-3 hours for meal as you will want  many courses.
