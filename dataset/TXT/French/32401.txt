gxMa7j1LXIUxxBoP0osDpA I had such a great experience here! Dinner was great - I had the salmon tartar for starters (amazing) and the trou normand (a palette cleanser and an absolute MUST!!). They bring you a great soup of the day if you order a main. I had the bison ribs for dinner, I wouldn't give them 100% but they were tasty. 

Plus it was a BYOW!
