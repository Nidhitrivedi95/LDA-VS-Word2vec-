ovtlrcsVRlgZZQUlHs_ovw The staff here is usually friendly, knowledgeable and helpful. I've seen a few things from some of the wait staff that made me think it COULD be rude (overhearing other tables) but I've never had an issue with my experiences.

The prices can get quite high but there are options for people on a budget.

The food:
The Vogue Burger is one of the best burgers I've ever had at a restaurant. They will cook it to the rarity you ask so if you are a fan of a bit more pink, go for it. I'd avoid rare because it may fall apart on you. This is a big burger.
The frito misto is a personal favorite. If you like a bit more heat ask for the chipotle aioli too. Don't expect to get tons of calamari with this side. But the combination of carrot, ginger, calamari, and aioli is usually one of my favorite parts of the menu.
The lemonade is crack. Stop asking me if I want another!
The wife loves the salmon appetizer. I usually steal her caper berries from it. I'm not a fan of lox but even I like it.
We've tried the mac and cheese once and I could totally order that as an entree (and then probably spend the next 5 hours on a treadmill).

This is one of my favorite places in the west valley when it comes to just wanting to try new things. My and the wife can order a burger each and a frito misto and get out for a decent price. Or we can decide to just order a handful of apps and treat it like a tapas style meal. I've heard some mixed reviews for this place but I haven't had any issues after about 5-10 visits in the past couple of years.
