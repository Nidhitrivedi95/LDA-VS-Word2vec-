4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I was here as a guest of my employer on my last trip to Vegas.

As I've mentioned in previous reviews I'm not a "Foodie" and truth be told my pre-determined idea of a French meal was not favorable. 

Post experience I may have fallen for Mon Ami Gabi!

If you have a meat-and-potatoes guy in your group this is a good choice because you can get that and anything else you want Ala cart.

Pot d'creme desert is amazing! 

We missed out on this one, if you can make reservations and get outside and at a time when the fountains are going off across the street you can see the fountains very well from the balcony. We only saw the show through an open doorway. 

Prices were in line with quality and staff was really attentive.

Good choice if you are looking for a great night out!
