Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA Funny thing is, we went to a burger place at Mandalay first. But they didn't come to our table for 5 minutes to even say hello. And 5 minutes is longer than you think when you just spent 90 minutes at the MJ One show and you're ready to eat off your hand with hunger. So we left. And came here. A bit different, to put it mildly. Service was impeccable, but not snooty. The Missus and I both got different tasting menus. Mine was the Alain Ducasse 4 course one sans wine. From the cold broccoli soup amuse to the amazing lobster curry to the foie gras topped filet to the Armagnac dessert, almost everything was very well presented and tasted amazing. First time with foie gras. Would definitely have been beyond the pale if served solo, but topping the perfectly cooked medium rare filet balanced it's richness. All I know is the junk was tasty. The only misstep was the mashed potatoes that accompanied  the filet. They were served in a bowl separate from the plate, and surprisingly...basic.  

Atmosphere was romantic, view was stunning, of course, and definitely an experience to remember. Not cheap. But actually worth it.
