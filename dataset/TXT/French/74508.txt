xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g Had reservations for four on Jan 1st. We were so looking forward to celebrating my husbands birthday. The atmosphere and view were the best things about the restaurant. Our French waiter was very pushy and difficult to understand. We ordered four entrees, four sides, and two soufflé desserts. As well as drinks.  All of which were bland and just ok. My filet and my friends lamb both had to be returned to the kitchen. My plate and filet weren't even luke warm. It's such a shame, it was supposed to be a fabulous experience, so disappointing. Next time, we will make reservations at the Bellagio for a better dining experience... oh!! Btw, HUGOS CELLAR at the Four Queens Hotel downtown is less than half the price with amazing service and food. They've been serving for 40 years!! You won't be disappointed, I promise!
