gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA I brought my girlfriend here for the great view and the warm reviews of the food.  Luckily, it wasn't the busiest time of year and we had a window seat with an amazing view of the city.
The food was very good, as was the service.  In fact, the girl at the front gave us a card that got us into ghostbar, moon and the playboy club VIP and no cover.
Overall value was okay.  The wine list is extensive, with prices inflated as is typical at almost any vegas restaurant.
I think Alize is a great place to take a date.  I would return.
