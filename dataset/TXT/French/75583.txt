Ycp3Agr7dt71TZkeKV7jng still LOVE le gourmand, but i have to admit that i've had better pastries in this wonderful city of food...and that the pain au chocolat is much better at rahier.  their pastry is pretty much consistently...perfect.  i'm still a big fan of the almond & chocolate croissants, but can't deny that perfection exists...elsewhere!
