C6hljmEZYZw4pA0OJaFOjQ Wow, what a well-kept secret and wonderful little eatery. A glance inside will have you thinking it's simply a café with sumptuous cakes. It is, but it's also a restaurant serving beautiful, fresh cooked French food at a very reasonable price. 

After stopping in one evening for a tea, and tea only, I came back the very next day for lunch. My French food eating partner in crime and I had a terrine to share, then one hake dish and one sea bass. The terrine was really beautifully seasoned, and the chutney it came with quite nice (it was the cumin that intrigued me). 

My hake was, well, it was simply delicious. A huge serving: thick, juicy, watery chunks of hake, contrasted with a thin, crispy slice of prosciutto, and both complimented by puréed butternut squash. The side of fries may have been an overestimation on my part, I barely made a dent in those. But that hake, for £10.50, was just beautiful.

I didn't have room for the cake that first caught my eye and enticed me in. I'll save that for an evening this Spring when I want a glass of wine and big slice of bannoffee pie at 8pm. Because you can get that here. You can also get a bratwurst hot dog, or fresh made waffles. There's a front room like a café, outdoor seating, and a big, spacious, light bright restaurant out the back.

Why I haven't been here before, I don't know. The whole menu looked delicious and I took a long time to decide. I'll be back soon, that's for sure. Don't pass it by, despite it's small appearance and little café inside. There's so much more than meets the eye.
