5fquJHY2hMX9tPRD5s0t5g I've been to Roosters on a couple of occasions and I was pretty pleased with the entire experience. The first time I went was with a coworker for lunch. I tried the steak burger with fries and he had the spit
roasted turkey breast sandwich. I had no complaints about my food but the service was a little slow, which is irritating when most people need to squeeze in lunch within an hour. 

The second time I went was for another company dinner. I got the BBQ chicken, assorted mushrooms and the butter wilted spinach. Every dish was outstanding and the service was excellent as well. I was also able to try the mac & cheese, Au gratin potatoes, and the gnocchi duck sugo and really enjoyed all of them. It's still not my top choice with all of the surrounding uptown restaurants, but I'm in no way disappointed.
