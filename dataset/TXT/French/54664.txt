rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw Went for brunch on a Saturday. Very different than most brunches I have been to because of the French influence. I got the sticky bun which they told me was a new item. It was very good but very sweet. I couldn't eat it all myself because it was so sweet so I had some of my friends hash browns. They were excellent. I also had champagne which was delicious. Service was good as was the decor.  I didn't do the unlimited rose wine but people seemed to be enjoying it. I've also been here for dinner and it was good too.
