4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I did my homework on Yelp for my upcoming trip to Vegas and was super excited to try Mon Ami Gabi! Other Yelp users commented on the great food and awesome service. I'm hoping my experience was the anomaly... but in either case, I don't think I'll be visiting this restaurant again.

Here's what happened:
- I made reservations for 11am Saturday brunch. Reservations are for the dining room ONLY, and although the outside patio seating looked awesome, I didn't want to wait over an hour in line.
- We came on time, at 11am, and were told it would be "just a sec" to get seated. However, we didn't get seated until 11:10am. I was willing to overlook this because I know their brunches must be crazy.
- The restaurant was VERY dim inside. I understand that it's part of the ambiance, but for this restaurant in particular, it didn't work. Maybe it was where we were seated, but I think I'd actually prefer to wait an hour for patio seating.
- After we were finally seated, the server came by and said he would bring out water and bread.  When he came by a few minutes later to take drink orders, we had to remind him about the water and bread again.  

THE FOOD:
- The brunch menu was underwhelming, surprisingly, so I ordered the Chicken and Mushroom crepe off of their lunch menu.
- When the food was brought out, it wasn't hot. The Chicken and Mushroom crepe was pretty good but nothing that blew me out of the water. I was disappointed that it wasn't warm at all.

- I REALLY wanted to try their bread (the French baguette that everyone here on Yelp mentioned) so we reminded our server about the bread about halfway through our meal. He said he would bring it out.
- The server never came by again and at this point we were pretty much done with our meals. What's the point of getting bread when you're done with the main course? Also, I was pretty surprised that none of the other parties around us were served any bread, either. At this point I was wondering if they ran out of bread.... but then why couldn't the server just tell us that? I shouldn't have to ask for something twice, especially when the server told me he would bring the bread out as soon as we got seated.

There were a bunch of people walking around in suits - I'm assuming were managers? I have no idea what they were supposed to be doing,  but they clearly weren't watching the tables.
The couple who sat next to us were waiting over 10 minutes for the check. And when they left, the table was left empty for another 10 minutes before someone came by to clean. Considering how busy the restaurant was, I assumed someone would come by to clean it up right away. I've been to much busier restaurants that are much better about efficiency.

By the end of my meal I was pretty annoyed with all that had happened. The server miraculously remembered that we never got any bread. He pointed to someone cleaning up and jokingly said "It was this guy's fault!  He was supposed to bring the bread out. Blame this guy!" Why was it HIS fault? It's still  YOUR job to ensure that the bread was brought out!

Again, I hope my experience was the anomaly but this experience left such a bad taste in my mouth that I'll probably never return again.
