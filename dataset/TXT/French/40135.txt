KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA My daughter suggested we stop here for a glass of wine for my husband's birthday. You enter through the wine store & the receptionist greets you. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because she was the only one answering the phone, seating people & pouring wine, so there was a wait to be seated, and quite a wait for our wine. There is a beautiful glassed in outdoor patio overlooking a lake, with a fireplace. We requested a table there & it was lovely. Our server, Jason was attentive & helped with the wine selection. My daughter & husband chose to share 3 3oz pours of their reserved wines. It is nice you can get a taste of these special wines without purchasing the whole bottle. We also had a cheese plate with 5 cheeses, nuts, grapes & candied pepper strips& that really complemented the wine. It was a nice way to spend an hour or so. They serve full meals also.
