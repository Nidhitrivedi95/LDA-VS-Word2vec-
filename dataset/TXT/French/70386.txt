Xa8aadsVfrqocGA_rVzsdA The girls and I went as part of the 2012 Happening Gourmand festival; none of us had been there before.

The restaurant itself is well-appointed with both round and square tables and beautiful circular booths. The exposed brick walls are beautiful but the rest of the color palette and decor was quite bland, beige and unassuming. The restaurant felt cozy and quiet on a very snowy winter night however. 

Service was impeccable. The hostess took our coats and led us through the restaurant in such a way as to disturb the other patrons as little as possible. 

The Happening Gourmand menu was limited - although there was a $27 option and $37 option. And, for the price, they certainly didn't skimp on size, presentation or flavour - a very good value!

We all opted for the butterniut squash soup with fried cippolini - delicious, warm and comforting. I had the lamb with lentils and chorizio as a main dish - the lamb was fantastic; it fell off the bone, didn't taste game-y and was perfectly seasoned. The beluga lentils were equally good but the chorizio bits in it were overly smoked for my taste. The desserts were served in very original jars - very cute - and i can confirm that both the chocolate mousse and coffee pannacotta were fantastic!

The wine menu only featured bottles and our waitress told us of the options by the glass - the price was about $13/glass and the Niagara pinot noir I sampled was very good. 

Wait staff was quick and noninvasive although we were served by about 3 different waitresses/busboys and each asked us who ordered what for every course.... not a huge deal but....

Also....we heard music thumping from Suite 701 upstairs which appeared much more festive. 

Overall, everything was delicious and service was good - the special menu was a great value! I would return with a date or perhaps my parents....it didn't feel very well-suited for a boisterous girls' night out.
