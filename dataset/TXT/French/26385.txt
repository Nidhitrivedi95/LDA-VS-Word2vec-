D7CnTsm8SCmbQghz1ioPdw While in Montreal we stumbled upon this place while walking in Old Montreal.  There are many to choose from, but this was a diamond in the rough.

We got there early for our 6:30 reservation.  We sat at the bar to have a drink.  I noticed a great selection of bourbons and asked about a few.  The guy behind the bar was very knowledgable and allowed me to sample a few.  I chose one and my wife had a glass of persuco.  We chatted with the bartender and he made us feel very welcome.

We ordered the steak tartare and the tuna tartare as appetizers.  They are known for the Tuna, but the steak was best ever.

My wife had the wild boar and I had the daily special, braised short ribs.  Both cooked perfectly and falling off the bone.  The reduction on the ribs was great, not overpowering.  The portions were too large to finish.  

It has a cool, stone loge atmosphere, eclectically decorated with vintage knick knacks and pictures.  Music was great alternative rock from the 70's through modern day.  We got out for about $100 a head with a couple of drinks each, including tip.  Very much worth it!!
