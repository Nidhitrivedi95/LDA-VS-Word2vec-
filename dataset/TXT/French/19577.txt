aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw I love places like this: quick and accessible outposts of renown chefs. OK, OK, I guess the word is cheap.

I tried the eclairs, muffins, chocolate croissants, macarons and focaccia during my stay. OK, I admit I have a problem when it come to sweets. 

Are macarons still trendy? I prefer the more classic baked goods. The croissants had a nice buttery aroma. The clerk recommended the blueberry muffin as a crowd pleaser and it indeed was very good..

Next trip to Vegas, the red velvet cupcakes. Or maybe if I have that urge I'll just go to Midway and hop on the next Southwest flight out there just for cupcakes. Life is short.
