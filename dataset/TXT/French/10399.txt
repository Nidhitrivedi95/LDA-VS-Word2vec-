4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw We were a group of five and came here for dinner before seeing the fountain. 
The baguette was really good. The escargot was amazing and we asked for more baguette to go with the escargot. 
The salad was very plain. The ribeye steak was not as good as I expected, nothing special. 

Now comes to the WORST part. The server seems impatient and he came to our table every 3 mins to take away our plates while we were still eating. He even took away our fries WITHOUT asking if we have finished!! I mean, how could this happen?! So rude!

Bad experience. Would not recommend people coming to this place neither for the food now for the fountain view.
