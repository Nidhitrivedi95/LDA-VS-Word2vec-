fVF5wayDyY6ZR5oJB1IK3g Really pleased I was able to come here for brunch.  My friend and I went this Saturday and arrived around 2 pm, and were seated quite quickly.

I ordered a bloody mary, and then we had the french toast with apples / pears / cranberries, and the trout and scrambled eggs on toast. The bloody mary was pretty darn good, but I wished it to be spicier! Personally, I really enjoyed the french toast - I've rarely had fresh cranberries on anything, and that added a nice touch to the overall dish, as simple as it is. The trout was fresh, though small in portions, but my friend was addicted to the scrambled eggs as they were sort of more liquid, like a scrambled egg sauce. We weren't huge fans of the toast that accompanied the eggs, though, as it was quite hard and we weren't a fan of the flavour.

Service was good - water was frequently refilled and staff were friendly.  The decor is quite like the post-modern industrial feel with industrial wire lightbulbs, and darker blue colours with cool art hanging about. I also really dug the wallpaper in the washroom, as a side note.

Glad I got to try Lawrence this time around!
