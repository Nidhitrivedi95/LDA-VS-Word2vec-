5fquJHY2hMX9tPRD5s0t5g We came here to celebrate my cousins birthday, we were seated "outside" in the corporate building. I loved the classy vibes of the place, very nice! Our waiter introduced himself formally, he knew the dishes very well & answered all of our questions. We were given bread & it wasn't warmed up; it kinda tasted like sliced bread from the package tbh. We ordered some dishes to share my FAVORITE dish was the calamari, the meat tasted very fresh & it was just seasoned perfectly! I had the mushroom dish & it was okay. However the other dishes I didn't really enjoy as much because I just felt like everything was way to oversalted and way overpriced for what we got. The salmon for example, it was fresh but we literally got a small piece of salmon that tasted like it's worth only half the price. There was nothing really special about it, same goes for the other dishes. Overall I did enjoy the service and the vibes of the place but I don't think I would be quick to come back anytime soon.
