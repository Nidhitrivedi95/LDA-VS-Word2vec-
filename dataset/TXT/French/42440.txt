lcTa0q9Wo4wNyLCIgWFRUA I have been to la Société many times in the past and the food is always amazing and the service is fast and very pleasant. 

Last night I came in for the Montreal en lumiere special. This event is celebrated among many other great restaurants across Montreal. This was by far my favourite menu. The plates were all unique and well seasoned with a nice presentation. I highly recommend the table d'hôte. 

The ambiance is very romantic and perfect for something intimate. 

I will continue to visit this restaurant as it is among my favourite spots in this city.
