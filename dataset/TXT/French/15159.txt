63qPRnFAjxtchnSTWBxwbw I woke up after a night of drinking and wanted poutine. Frites Alors had it, in spades! The restaurant is a cute little place in the center of montreal, they serve a  number of different types of Poutine. The service was actually good, and on top of the good service and poutine they had a very good menu for beer! I know it was brunch but I couldnt help but get myself one of their beers from a local brewery! Quebec is a light year ahead of Ontario in terms of beer, and I definitely enjoyed being able to get good beer just about everywhere. I enjoyed the Poutine, which had fried onions on it, and tasted pretty good. I would definitely go back here!
