SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ We brought a friend to House of Tricks a few nights ago. The experience was somewhat disappointing for a few reasons. We were seated outside, at our request, and nearly immediately noticed the construction going on across  the street. The lights were intense and glaring in our friend's face-this, of course, was not the restaurant's fault and our server, Sarah, offered to position the table umbrellas to block the light which did help. The night we went was a Thursday and the restaurant was busy but not terribly. Nonetheless, the service was quite slow. The food was very good, once received. I think we will hold off on returning until the construction in the area is completed.
