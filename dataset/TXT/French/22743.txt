My last visit I had the special Jambalaya, which was amazing. There was plenty of shrimp, the grits were cooked perfectly and the onion peels were a really nice touch.

The shrimp and grits are also great, however the Tuna is probably the best thing on the menu. The kale & cranberry salad complements the tuna perfectly.

Definitely would recommend to friends.
