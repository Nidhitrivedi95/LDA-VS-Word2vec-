Near the end of a perfect meal (in a 3 star Michelin joint) Joel Rebouchon Las Vegas

So it's pretty simple on the recipe for this one, take a delicious cold lemon curd fluff type thing and add amazing blueberry sorbet. Mix in some wonderful floral syrup and candied violet petals and then seal it in a perfect sphere of sugar. Not in my entire life, and i eat and travel alot, have i ever been this amazed by desert. The food before made space and time its bitch, effing amazing. The service, the bread cart, the butter cart, the candy/cookie cart, next to nothing. Those who say food is merely to "sustain life" have never lived. The suckling pig with white beans was the best food i've ever put into my face. Wait, have to mention the potatoes, served with main course. I guarantee, if there was a christian god, she would bathe in these. 2lbs Potatoes to 1lbs of butter, my god. the prior courses were good, but not spectacular so the finale was like the biggest fireworks display you've been apart of, slow to start, good, great, holy cow, to dear effing hey-zeus. There is a reason that the tire company rates restaurants and there's a reason this one of the best of them.

Moral of the story is... If you ever have a chance to eat this well, you should try, just once, i on the other hand will do it as much as possible and maybe bring the wife next time.
