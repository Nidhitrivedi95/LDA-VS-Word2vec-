4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Mon Ami Gabi was one of the best restaurants I visited in Las Vegas. The food and the service were great and the price was even better. Food on the strip can be outrageous! Mon Ami Gabi was well priced with good food. I suggest eating outside on the patio if you can so you can watch the water show at the Bellagio.
