ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug Service was so slow at 3 am. Not too many people were eating at that time. My friend and I went to eat at Le Cafe after our spouses passed out upstairs. LAME! Anyway, we ordered the jalapeno cheddar burger medium. It came medium well instead. I wasn't being too picky at the time considering we hadn't eaten in over 15 hours. From what I remember, the burger was delicious. So were the fries. I'd go back but probably only for some more drunk eats.
