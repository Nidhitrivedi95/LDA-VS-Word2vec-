Au Pied de Cochon gets booked up quickly, so try to make reservations in advanced.  When you're here expect that everything you eat will be extra savory & fatty.  We ended up with a 10pm Saturday reservation booking about a week in advance. 

We started with the tomato tartlet which is probably the healthiest dish we tried. The french onion soup was too salty for my taste and took away from any enjoyment. 
We followed with the foie gras poutine, my goodness it's hearty and overwhelming.  But wow the flavor is amazing.  They do not cheap out on the foie gras either.  Then we moved onto the special of the night, a 1.5 lb lobster roll topped with foie gras slices and spicy mayo.  This dish again was overwhelming, but the chunks of fresh lobster paired with foie gras was over overpowered by the spicy mayo.  Would definitely recommend ordering without the spicy mayo. 

They have this amazing desert of poached pear & vanilla ice cream that cleanses your fatty arteries after your hearty meal of indulgence.
