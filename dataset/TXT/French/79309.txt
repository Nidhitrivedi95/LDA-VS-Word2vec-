ZgiSgTwHOoxdfi0unI36Mg This review is for drinks only!! Since we were staying at the Westin, this was our preferred meeting spot before dinner! Our bartender after the first time, remembered exactly what we wanted so as soon as we walked into the bar, she always got our drinks together quick!!! The smokey old fashioned was good! We opted for rye instead of makers mark. Yummo!!!I'll take ten of those merci beaucoup!
