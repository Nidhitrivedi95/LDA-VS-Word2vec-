QEgfK_TKY8bwK-YzKDdkGw Charlotte is not known for a lot of French restaurants, La Bibliotheque was the last one I remember and always loved. Since then I have searched and with Lumiere have found my new French restaurant love.
I was able to obtain a reservation for six during restaurant week and enjoy an amazing experience and meal with friends.

Upon arriving we were greeted by a sweet hostess who took our coats, not too many restaurants offer that service anymore, nice!  We then were seated at an already preset table for six, which was nice.
Our waiter, James, arrived and offered water while we waited for the rest of our guests to join.  Once all six of us were there we received an amazing amuse, a starter of a pear and apple bisque soup with a cheddar roll, which was still steaming upon my first bite.  This amuse made me excited for the rest of the meal.

I started with the poached lobster appetizer. Amazing poached lobster atop green beans and thinly sliced artichokes.
Onto the entrée. I went with the striped seabass served with asparagus, white onions and a sweet potato gratin.  The striped bass with cooked to perfection with an amazingly crisp skin...how do they do that?? I also was able to taste some of the other items ordered, poin loin chop and short rib, which were also amazing.
Throughout the meal our waiter refilled our water and wine promptly and checked in often.

After our entrees were cleared, dessert arrived.  I chose a cream filled puff pastry, cannot recall the name, but it was light and fluffy and a perfect end to a perfect meal.
Overall, Lumiere is an experience not too be missed.  I look forward to my next visit.
