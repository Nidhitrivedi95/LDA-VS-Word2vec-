ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug Came here looking for a good meal, for a reasonable price. What we got, was a great dining experience! My wife and I are always in search of good food, since recently moving to Vegas about a year ago. From the moment we walked it, we were greeted kindly, and got a great table location, within 5 minutes (Tues night 9pm). Our server Antoun, was awesome, and provided great customer service. My wife had prime rib, and I had the ribeye, both cooked to perfection! I really came for the escargot....and it was amazing!!! I almost had it for dessert, it was that good! Cheesecake came with our meal, which was yummy too. 
Our drinks were delish as well. I highly recommend the Chardonnay, by William Hill!!!. When we got the bill, we were pleasantly surprised that it was barely over $100! Remember, we each had the four course meal, escargot app, drinks, and dessert.....at a French restaurant!!! Magnifique!!!
