zw4Legbcu018p5WcZ74iWA This is by far my favourite poutine place in Montreal. The portions aren't overwhelming and are priced appropriately. The fries are nice and crispy, the cheese curds squeaky, and the gravy just simply divine.

I usually get the patatine, but keep in mind that the mushrooms, onions, and peppers are raw (I like it that way but I have friends who don't). If you're still hungry, their fish sliders are also really great, and only $3!

Most importantly though, is that they're open until 2am, and it tastes even better when you're drunk!!
