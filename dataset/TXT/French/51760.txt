PlYrlj86zAYljZTRCBSZ3A I think Blog T.O. got it right when they ranked nom nom nom crepes as the best poutine hub in they city! The stand can't be any larger than a hot dog cart, but it's unbelievable what glorious food is produced in such a tiny area.
I believe the man working at the stand was in fact the owner, as he seemed so passionate and genuinely happy with what he was doing, it was wonderful :) He also explained how he has a loyalty card set up; get a stamp for every $4 spent, get 10 stamos and you get a free crepe! Probably one of the best, if not the best, loyalty card I've ever seen.
Serving both sweet and savoury crepes, and about 8 exquisite poutine flavours, I opted for the Parisienne poutine ; crispy onions,homemade gravy, fries cooked freah right before your eyes, cheese curds,  seasoned chicken breast (which was so so moist and flavourful),  and the piece de resistance,  slices of Brie cheese :') 

The way the Brie stretched and pulled and oozed and goozed....it was really too good to be true! I've tried many poutines in my life, and I gotta say, I don't think this one will be beat!
Especially considering the fact that it's such a tiny stand, with such a passionate owner running it, that makes me even more intrigued to give my business to him. 
Please, help nom nom nom crepes grow, and help yourself by indulging in the tastiest poutine our city has to offer!
