ZdaZwXC0FByDY3EwNELphw Terrible  service , overpriced and pretentious. Unfriendly  servers.  The host did not note down our reservation.  Me and girlfriend dressed causal and we received  cold reception, seated by the corner at the  bar.  The food was not impressive.  The  steak was fatty and we were told to move our handbags so they can squeeze  additional  patrons on already  crowded bar. We barely  had space for  our  food. Also, there were poor air circulation , the place  smelt like wet diapers. It is sad to see Ossington  going  down hill. It is  no longer  the place  for  genuine company and quality food. From this experience  of Union, ossington  is sadly  becoming fake and pretentious just like so many other places in the city :(
