Ncvd4l3zo72FUK5kovQhYQ Cafe des Amie is hit or miss.  One day it will be a pleasant experience, and then the next time you start to wonder how they're able to stay open.  

The food is pretty good and always fresh.  I like their omelets because they're light and fluffy, not dripping with grease (but I do need to add some salt).  I appreciate fresh ingredients and will pay a little more for them.  This place can get very expensive, though, for what it is.  You order and pay at a counter and basically take care of your own drinks, clean up, etc.  The prices are out of line with this self-service atmosphere.  Sometimes the staff will bring your food to you, but other times we've had to return to the counter to check on the food.   We are a family of four and can easily spend $40-50 here at lunch, or breakfast even.  That's way too much for a place that's basically a glorified Ikea cafeteria.

I agree with other reviewer's assessment of the staff.  Not the warmest bunch of ladies.  I went in once late in the morning to sit down with a coffee and read my email in the corner.  Oh the looks they gave me!  I couldn't understand it.  I was the only customer in a room full of empty tables, and they were looking at me like I was sitting there slowly sipping my drink during the rush with people lined up out the door.  I guess I'll stick with Starbucks for my break time.
