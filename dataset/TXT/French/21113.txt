If you have been to Paris, the taste of the pastries will take you back to the flavors and flair of that great city

I have been in to Au Petit Four a couple times, the first time everything looked so good I ended up with a tray of goods and got about 8 different items - that was a delicious day

Fast forward several months later and I stopped in again to pick up dessert for a bbq,  and the desserts were the hit of the event, the mille feuille and chocolate praline dessert were the two favorites, however everything is excellent

There is really no better spot to get in the greater Phoenix area to get pastry than here, I would highly recommend stopping in

As of this review I have not been in for food of a non sugar primary ingredient variety, however based on the pastry I would guess the food would follow suit
