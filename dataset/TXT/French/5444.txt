3jKUbhGSjFTv5jZ0wnW0xA My friends and I came here on the last night of our Montreal trip and it was the perfect spot. 

Food 5/5: I admit I don't know too much about French food but everything was delicious. I started with the Escargots which had tender snails and fresh greens. For my main I had the Fresh Egg Tagliatelles which was some of the best homemade pasta I've ever had. Some of my friends started with the French Onion Soup which was a huge portion and oozing with cheese. The broth was very tasty although I wish there was more of it, it all soaked into the bread. Another friend had the Duck Confit which was fall off the bone good and now every time she has duck in Toronto, she complains its not as good. The house wine was also quite nice, a chardonnay but not overly dry, $30 for the bottle.

Service 5/5: Our waiter was really nice and attentive, taking the time to answer our questions about the menu. Also, because we were a big group, it took us a while to get a table so we were one of the last people there but he never made us feel rushed.
