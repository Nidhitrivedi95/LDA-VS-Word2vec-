z6ZPIpO_1Rx69k9y2DQ7Bw What was once 'Mimi's', which mysteriously burned down and then pops up 'la Madeleines' ( within the same family of restaurants), also carries a similar menu. This is a self-serve ordering line-up and a get your own coffee. Not a fan of this place as the food did not appear freshly cooked, but more like stand-by pre-processed food items down to the small fruit bowl.... if that's what you want to call that!
I was incredibly NOT impressed with the entire process and the meal itself, and felt like a greatly wasted my $$.
Oh well, you live and you learn..... but, never again.
