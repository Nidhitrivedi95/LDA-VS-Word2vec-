One of the only places where I have found that you can sit almost right on the strip and people watch everyone walk by.  The salmon is to die for, just outstanding, I don't know what the sauce is they use but it is sweet and matches the salmon nicely.  I alway like to sit on the patio when I go. and while you pay a location price it is one of the best in the entire city.
