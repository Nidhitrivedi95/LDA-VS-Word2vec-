hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA I always pass this place while driving on the 215 and wondered if it was any good. I always assumed it would be some typical cafe with subpar food and generic coffee, considering it's location in a cluster of business buidlings. And boy, i was wrong! I was in the area today so i decided to try it out. When we got there, there was a line literally going out the door. We waited about 15 minutes so i would suggest avoiding going there during lunch hour. When we got to the register, we were helped by a guy who was really friendly and informative about their menu. He remembered our names and seemed to genuinely care for his customers. 

I got the turkey sandwich and an iced white mocha and my friend ordered the curry chicken sandwich and a funky monkey specialty drink. We were so hungry and being that they were so busy, we knew it would take some time to get to our order so we grabbed a goji bar to munch on. The bar was made from all naural products so i expected it to taste like cardboard but it ended up being SO GOOD! Our sandwiches were also delicious, especially the baguette that they were on. 

While waiting for our food, we kept eyeing the peach tart that was in the display case. We ended up giving in and buying a slice and im sooo glad we did! It was probably my favorite part of the meal. It wasnt too sweet and the crust was the best i've tasted in a while! 

This place is awesome and i would definitely recommend eating there!
