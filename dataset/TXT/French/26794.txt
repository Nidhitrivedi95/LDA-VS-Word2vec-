Da6eZFThE9xanUAGNpZxAg We had a wonderful experience at Nuit, which we stumbled on a Monday night (lucky us, wine bottles are 1/2 price on Mondays!) during a visit from New York City. The atmosphere is laid back but elegant; we enjoyed sitting outdoors on the small back patio. The service was wonderful: genuinely friendly and accommodating and the food was delicious. We enjoyed charcuterie and the Italian fire olives, and a selection of the shared plates. The octopus fregola was a standout. Though we didn't have much room for dessert, we couldn't pass up the homemade parmesan cheesecake - it was worth the splurge. I can't recommend this restaurant enough - it's atmosphere, delicious food and reasonable prices made it one of our favorites in Toronto!
