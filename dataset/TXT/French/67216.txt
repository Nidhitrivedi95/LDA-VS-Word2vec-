USleI8g1UVN9-9jm-b4uIg I know, I know, I know: only 3 stars with such glowing reviews.  The Fig Tree absolutely nails it on service, ambiance, and wine selection.  Thank you Zack for your expert care of my wife and I as we celebrated her birthday.  The evening could not have been nicer.  The elk was cooked perfectly and is a definite repeat.  

However . . . for starters we ordered a sausage-stuffed calamari, and a grilled octopus with an eggplant ragu.  With both dishes the star ingredient was lost.  The sausage overwhelmed the delicate squid and the octopus was buried under a pile of muddled flavors.  Having spent time grazing around the Mediterranean, these appetizers did not deliver on any level.  Lastly, my wife ordered the trout and commented it was over-cooked and mushy.   After tasting it, I agreed (fortunately there was plenty of elk, so she didn't leave hungry)!

Score 1-0 for red meat, but 0-3 on seafood.  I'm OK with top prices but not while batting a paltry .250 average.
