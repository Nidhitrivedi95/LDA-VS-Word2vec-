aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw I have been wanting to try this place forever! We finally got a chance when we got a free nights stay at The Venetian. I don't think we went to the actual bakery because I didn't see half the desserts people are posting in pictures. We asked an employee of the hotel and she directed us to a small shop upstairs foe the casino with only a small selection of desserts. We didn't mind because we were going only for the macarons. I was hesitant and couldn't believe I was spending almost 20 bucks on 6 cookies. I've never had a macaron and was nervous because what if they were gross? Luckily, these were so good!! We got vanilla, chocolate, raspberry, pumpkin, PB and jelly, and pistachio. They looked so beautiful in the box! I tried the vanilla first. I loved the texture! Soft and chewy and so good! The PB and Jelly was my absolute favorite and the chocolate was my daughters favorite. Least favorite was the pumpkin. The pistachio and vanilla tastes very similar to me but we're still delicious! So glad we finally tried this place. Unfortunately, it's located on the strip and we don't go down there often but just might have to make a special trip for another PB and Jelly! Yum!!
