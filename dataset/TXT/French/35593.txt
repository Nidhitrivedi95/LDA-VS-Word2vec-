htQgj-ANQpZGpIpkkrEmyQ We highly recommend this place!

Went here for lunch on a Sunday. Place was not busy at all. Service was excellent. Seating space was small so it will probably be best to book reservation on peak time.

Hubby's obsession with chicken and waffles was highly satisfied. Star-anise flavour with blueberry compote was great mix. Wifey tried the salmon poke bowl and it was surprisingly good.
