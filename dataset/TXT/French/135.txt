-4TMQnQJW1yd6NqGRDvAeA Having been warned about what to expect in Old Town Scottsdale, was completely taken aback to find The House, more Southern Charm and less Jersey Shore for sure! 

Plumpjack wine and fine whiskeys? But of course. Daily foie gras specials? NBD. Velvet wallpaper and candles everywhere? Duh.

Having visited SUR and PUMP recently in LA (both Vanderpump establishments), they should pay The House a visit for some tips on decorating and customer service. The House is more than a facade, they actually care about the customers - every customer, not just the "famous" ones. 

On Monday evening, the foie special was a gluttonous dessert dish of Brioche French toast, maple brown sugar butter and a generous piece of fatty duck liver on top. Each bite melted in my mouth. Very well executed.

The ambiance, the wine, the food make this brasserie tops on my list in Scottsdale. Upscale, but not pretentious. 5-stars.
