RfsMUrGUJdrpfrU54rmEsQ The food and service was very good. We both had the filet which was delicious with the peppercorn sauce and excellent potato. It did take about an hour to get our entree but we did order the escargot. My wife loved it but the pesto was a little too much for me. For desert we had the chocolate soufflé which was life changing. Overall, a very nice experience. Quicker service and this place is five stars.
