rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw I've been to Vegas about 100 times over the years.  This is hands down the best brunch I've had, not only in Vegas but in my life.

The service is top notch and the French Toast tastes like something out of this world.  And the burger, the rose, eggs Benedict.

You got to be kidding me!
