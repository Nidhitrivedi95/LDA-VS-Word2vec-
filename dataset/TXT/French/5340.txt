3FlWR_osNPb8dcqLgHebHw Decided to go to Mimi's for some Sunday night comfort food. What the heck is happening to Mimi's? Can you choose a menu and stick with it for a while? The constantly changing menu is incredibly aggravating. So..... we try to order dinner. How about the salad with salmon? NO - off the menu! The waiter said it can still be ordered but with honey mustard dressing? no, no, no, - Mimi's no longer has honey mustard dressing. WHAT? We asked if the hamburgers were 4 or 8 ounces as 8 ounces is too much and food is wasted. He said 4 ounces (with confidence) and when we asked him to double check, he walked over to the mgr. and came back determined they are 4 ounces. We ordered a burger - it was big and didn't look like a 1/4 pound. We mentioned this to our server and he said "Well, they used to call it the French Quarter so it must be a 1/4 pound". Really? For fun, we asked him to check with the chef. He came back and said "it's 7.9 ounces". Well, there goes your French Quarter theory, young man. The food was so-so, service was okay but the waiter could have made more $$$ if he knew the menu and could have bothered to check with the kitchen staff who might actually know the size of the burger patty. Overall, we did have dinner but there are way too many places to eat in ANY town to bother with Mimi's.
