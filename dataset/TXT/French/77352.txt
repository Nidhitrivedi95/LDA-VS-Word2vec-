YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g Came here for a birthday dinner (mine!) and got a semi-private space (curtained off) for our group of 7.  Tapas style was perfect for us and most of the food was delicious.  
Standouts:  Parmesan paprika popcorn, "in the shower" mac and cheese, burrata, cheesecake lollipops, coconut soup, tiramisu, pineapple carpaccio, and the AFFOGATO, YUM!!! 
Good:  Sliders, skirt steak, rock shrimp (not much shrimp though), mushroom ragout, creme brulee, 
Ok but not great:  crab and avocado, hummus, panna cotta.
