ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug I would tend to say that, outside of `steakhouse` and `gourmet` rooms at casinos, casino fare usually is blah. This was a not blah.We ordered teh prix fixe steak specials (bride had a filet mignon ,myself a ribeye) and found the food adequate.The mashed potatoes seemed not the most genuine however,couldn`t put our fingers on it but they mashed were a fail.The cheesecakes for desert were surprisingly FULL SIZED! and pretty good.For $39 prix fixe on the strip we felt we had a good value. Would we return? perhaps is nothing else avail or if staying on site.Waiters ok. Busboy a little slow w/refill,the waiter had to get on him to get drinks for our table & others
