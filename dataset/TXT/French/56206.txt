rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A There's a Bouchon in LA that I haven't gotten around to trying yet, but after having brunch here in Vegas it's been bumped up on my to-try list!

We arrived around 11am on a Saturday morning and waited about 20 minutes for our party of 10 to be seated - not bad. (Maybe just lucky though...)

Service was a little bit slow, maybe because we were in a back room with a few other large parties. They seated us even though we were missing a few in our party, which was nice. 

I ordered the corned beef hash, and also tried the omelette du jour and chicken&waffles. Heads up that the corned beef hash was A LOT of meat! And not much else... Tasty but didn't really hit the spot after a long night... chicken and waffles probably would have been a better choice. The chicken was very moist and waffles tasty. Really good syrup too, but it was at $26. Sharable for breakfast/brunch, but probably not for a full lunch/dinner. The corned beef hash was $17 I think.

The star of the morning for me was the beignets for sure! They come with a chocolate sauce and a currant (?) compote, both of which went well with the donuts. Really moist and cakey - what I imagine they would taste like in New Orleans!

I also got an OJ with my breakfast which tasted like it came from the carton and not fresh squeezed. Kind of a disappointment for $4.
