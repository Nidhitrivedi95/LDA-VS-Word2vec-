 This place got even better when I visited with my Mom on the eve of Mother's Day.  They had a ridiculously delicious prix fixe menu with so much food for only $32!  In honour of Mothers, they had a diamond dinner set featuring a platter of 6 apps, which included lobster bisque, beef carpaccio, smoked salmon and lamb in sugar cane.  The platter presentation was haute cuisine and so was the taste.  Then you get to choose for your entree either Filet Mignon with shrimps in Bearnaise sauce or Lobster Thermidor.  By golly you could not go wrong with either.  This was the best filet mignon I have ever tasted and I got to sample the Lobster Thermidor and it was soooo very good.   For dessert you get 3 types which included a custard with fruits and divine raspberry mousse.  Why did this meal have to end?  

My mother was so impressed with the food and service.   I am so very glad that she had a great time and it did not break the bank too much!  I will come here again and again because this is truly a gem!
