tCSlpwJQ4CZsUEMZeH2SFg We were gifted a groupon to Cafe Monte. 

Ambiance was ideal, no strident music or harsh lighting. Bakery case promised future delights.

Grateful for a concise menu, hate to read a book to choose my meal.

The warm baguette with butter was so delicious it did not last on the table. Waiter graciously offered another one.

Chose beef bourguinon, meat was seasoned well and so tender, only needed a fork to enjoy. Au jus was beefy and could have used some extra bread to 'sop up'. Baby onions were sweet and mushrooms were finely sliced.  Winning dish!!!!

My dining companion  chose the roast chicken. Sadly, the herb seasoning did not infuse the meat. Without a sauce, there was nothing to say.

Macarons were nuggets of artistry. Enjoyed tremendously. 

Minus one star since service was polite but we felt 'tolerated',  there was no attempt at engaging in conversation or inquiry about special ocassion. Another table merited a long and involved conversation. 

A lovely place to enjoy when you tire of the chain restaurant scene.
