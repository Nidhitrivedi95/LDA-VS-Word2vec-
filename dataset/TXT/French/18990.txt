An_U8woQkFVsMqVblkImZQ I really love DT Bistro. The food is always excellent. I think they really excel with anything having to do with mushrooms. The mushroom soup is one of a kind. It earthy and creamy without being overwhelmingly heavy. It's so flavourful I admit to dreaming of it on a cold winters day. The mushroom pappardelle is also amazing. The noodles are so fresh and the mushrooms give that perfect chewy texture with a perfect light sauce to really let the mushrooms shine. At lunch the mushroom panini is stellar the goat cheese and the crunch from the focaccia are perfection. My favourite desserts there are the passionfruit guava gelato, or recently had an amazing coconut gelato, as well the raspberry chocolate tart is delightful. Will continue to come back for any special occasion I can!
