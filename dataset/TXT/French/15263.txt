6fPQJq4f_yiq1NHn0fd11Q the crepes are HUGE! they aren't that cheap, but crepes everywhere aren't that cheap anyways. we got a spinach and mozzerella one (i forgot the name) and then for dessert, we got a strawberry one (again, i forgot the name). two crepes between 3 girls. we were super stuffed afterwards. halfway through, we were already full, but it was so good that we had to keep going! i would definitely some back here the next time we're in vegas!
