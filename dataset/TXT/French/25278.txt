Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA Really good food and excellent service.  We did not find the chef's tasting menu bland but we are not heavy salt/processed food consumers...
It was not overly crowded and we enjoyed a nice, romantic dinner seated in a booth that resembled a big half dome.

Check out the restrooms adjacent to the bar behind the restaurant...pretty cool view from the "throne." lol.
