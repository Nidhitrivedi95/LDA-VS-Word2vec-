4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Almost as good as it gets!!! Very good steak frites and escargot. I recommend waiting a bit to eat the snails -- let them marinate in that yummy garlic butter sauce while you munch on some baguette.

Our waiter was great. He was one of those detail-oriented guys. He was looking for spots on wine glasses and I even saw him straighten some forks on the table next to us. He was kind enough to write down the name of the wine for us.

Great wine... 

Great service... 

We were seated immediately...

Everything was fabulous, but it's still not as good as being in the Latin Quarter in Paris! Best escargot EVER!
