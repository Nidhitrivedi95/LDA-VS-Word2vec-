I had the quiche which was flavorful and was a great pairing with the salad. My boyfriend had he Niçoise salad he opted to skip the canned tuna and substituted salmon.The greens were fresh and salmon was flavorful. Alex brought us not only a complementary cheese and meat plate but also a lemon brûlée to finish meal. His service and thoughtful hospitality turned our frowns upside down.
