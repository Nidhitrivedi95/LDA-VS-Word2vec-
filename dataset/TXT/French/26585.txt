D87tFO-R6U8f4-e0r4Zq_g This place is quite small and gets really busy..the girls behind the counter are really Gorgeous with caked up makeup and uberly platinum blonde hair... Ok now since that is the first thing I noticed here back to the ambiance.. Again did I mention this place is really small. We were seated next to teen and twenty somethings thank gawd the aroma of the food was pulling me back toward the menu and not my neighbours 25 times "like, like" loud conversation..
To test the waters I ended up ordering something simple like the Nutella Crepe with bananas and my friend ordered the Chaw Ko Laaat (so much for my French accent) Crepe which consisted of Dark French chocolate and bananas. So we received the Crepes  minus the plates?! That's the least you expect are plates at a sit down place..Crepes  came out in a paper pouch! The verdict it was not bad..was it the best in the city... No. Was it price accordingly yes, actually on the cheaper side...everything was under $20.00. Will I skip this place next time in Yorkville? OUI!!
