KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA This review is mainly for the Happy Hour which was recently introduced. To improve the winter dining comfort on the patio, several fireplaces have been added to augment the vertical floor heaters.
Our server Matt was friendly and provided excellent service.

The Happy Hour menu consists of a small number of appetizer size plates all at the same price. The wine selection was varied and all are half price by the glass.

On this evening we chose two items from the Happy Hour menu, the Escargot and Beef Ravioli. Also ordered was the Braised Beef entree from the dinner menu. 
The Escargot were plump and served piping hot in an excellent butter, garlic, herb sauce. Don't forget to use the crusty bread to soak up the extra sauce. 
The Beef Ravioli contained extremely tender meat. The ravioli's were perfectly cooked and swimming in a tasty sauce along with caramelized onions. 
The Red Wine Braised Beef is served with White Truffle Grits and Roasted Cipollini Onions. Mashed potatoes were requested in place of the grits. The beef was cooked for four hours and was fork tender. The rich wine sauce was perfect with the creamy mashed potatoes.

The desert menu was irresistible. Both the Creme Brulee and Tiramisu were superb.

We have now added Marche Bacchus to our year round dining list.
