kKC7UTcHZM3zLfT97x3msg I don't understand why people like this place so much. Our friends (who are super picky like us) recommended if and were very excited to take us there. The decor is super outdated and borderline cheesy. I only state that because for the price of the food I expect better. The wait service was terrible. It took 15 mins for someone to address us after we were seated and it wasn't very busy. I had problems choosing items off the menu and what I do choose was underwhelming to say the least. I had the soup which lacked flavour and the steak which was just average. I wouldn't go back or recommend this place to any of my friends. Definitely not at all close to the talk.
