oZHbPhIj01_31jqD053a_Q Eurpea was recomended from our hotel.  However, If you are hungry do not bother coming to this place.  

Starting on a bad note...Our table was updatirs near the spiral staircase and shook everytime the waiters and patrons went up and down the stairs.  That was very distracting.

The portions were small, in fact the chef contantly sends out free apps, like the lobster bisque in a espresso cup  Other free apps were cheese cigars, similar to a mozarella stick, tempura cauliflower, mini olive muffin and a small sampling of  deserts.

However, the real misconception was the hen I ordered was shown in the roating pot tableside  and was brought back to the kitchen and presented back to me with only 2 oz of meat.  For the price of $34, I should get 1/4 bird.

I also agree with other reviews the wine pours are skimpy as well.

The food presenations was pretty cool, but I would rather have bigger portions.   

I would not go back again.
