58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw I wish I found this place the first morning we arrived in Montreal because I would have been there everyday for breakfast. 

Cons: 
-Pricey for breakfast. There was 3 of us and with one coffee and one breakfast platter each we payed over $90 with tax and tip. 
-Gets crowded fast. We luckily came a little early and didn't wait longer then 10 mins (bonus: outside tables are just first come and taketh- you don't have to wait on the line)
Pros: 
-The most delicious breakfast I have had in a very very very long time. I ordered a salmon bagel plate. It's came with a bagel with lox and cream cheese with onions and these deliciously huge capers. The bagel was thin, crunchy on the outside and nice and fluffy on the inside. It also came with a salmon biscuit (baked salmon and some flour) which was flavorful and not too dry. There was also a side omelet which I just couldn't fit in my stomach. And some fruit and small salad. My boyfriend had a delicious breakfast meat platter with fried beans served on cast iron. Came with some delicious toast too. 

I woke up today dreaming about another breakfast like this. It's a most to visit.
