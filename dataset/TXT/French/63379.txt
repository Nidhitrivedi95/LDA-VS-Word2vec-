SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA First timers at the restaurant. We arrived early and were able to grab a table out in the patio. Highly recommended.

The cocktails were great, even our server was able to offer suggestions based on likes and dislikes and hit the on the head.

We ordered the charcuterie and were pleased with it. We did not stay for dinner but we will definitely be back.

All in all the atmosphere and patio make this a restaurant to recommend for a night out on the town.
