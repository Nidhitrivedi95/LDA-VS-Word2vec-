cNkm08qu--yjIY_NPxrS2g Great service and food. The view is amazing. You can order food and whole waiting just go outside to have your drink. I had a beef tartar and my friend the fish and chips. Both were amazing but I would definitely recommend the fish and chips. Amazing place to impress someone.
