qCSyiWDbjks5OeWHlLqd7w Although often overlooked by the critics, this is one of my favorite restaurants in Montreal.  I had the horse steak and is was as tender and tasty as can be. The seared  duck breast was so perfectly cooked and not greasy, that it could easily have been confused with a fine steak. Dessert here was delightfully rich, but small enough to not overwhelm the palate. They even gave us a small appetizer while we were waiting for our table. What class! Best of all, the meal was reasonably priced and service was everything that I could have hoped for. 

The only thing I can add it  this restaurant is very small and the food is excellent, so it is always packed. Therefor, reservations are essential.
