_cjPEH9wXhKS-HQe_U3M4Q Well ... overall a worthwhile experience.  The wine list is very extensive with choices from many countries, types and all price ranges.  
The seating was a bit too close for my taste, and not as intimite/private as it could've been.
We ordered a NY strip and rissoto as mains and they were both good.  Not great.  Just good.  The portions and sides were quite small ... and I'm a big dude, and was damn hungry ... so sure my 8oz steak went down fine, but the accompanying beans and potatoes were just not quite enough.
Not overpriced, otherwise I'd be writing a very bad review.  Moderately priced ... so an OK experience overall.  If you're 60+ and/or french ... this is the place!  lol.
