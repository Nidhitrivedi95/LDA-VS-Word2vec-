YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g Given our heightened expecations, this was a disappointment.  We did the Mini Tour - food was pretty mediocre.  Wine pairings were decent.  

Went on a Saturday night at 8:00pm and the place was half empty - not a very fun and happening LV vibe!

Staff was attentive and friendly.

I don't think anyone would bother with this place if it weren't for the celeb chef name.
