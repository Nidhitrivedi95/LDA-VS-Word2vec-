4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw The location and view alone deserves 5 stars! But thankfully the food was great too! Everyone raves about breakfast so we had to make it our first stop of the day. We opted for the cappuccinos and the froth was perfect, some places don't get it right! We did the eggs Benedict and the chicken apple crepe. Both filled with flavor and large portions. We decided to do the Nutella waffle as a dessert option, it was so tasty we forgot to take a photo! Crispy on the outside and moist on the inside and Nutella makes everything taste fantastic. We were able to score a $20 off coupon so it made the experience even better! Would come again!
