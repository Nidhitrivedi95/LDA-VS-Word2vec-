xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g My family and I had an extremely disappointing experience at the Eiffel Tower Restaurant. This restaurant came to my family as highly recommended. The attention to service and detail was lost at Eiffel Tower Restaurant. 

We were not given our table of choice, and were told that the table was unavailable. However, throughout the course of the evening, we saw that the table was available. While we waited for an alternate table, the hostess had us awkwardly wait in the front to be moved one table up. My family and I were excited to sit near the fountains. Unfortunately, this request was not honored, despite my sister noting this request when making our reservation, and upon check-in.

We also had a negative experience with our waitress. She did not make us feel welcome, and was very forceful about ordering items off of the menu. As soon as we sat down, she was pushing us to order soufflé, without even introducing the specials or asking about beverages. I understand that that soufflé takes longer to make, but she asked several times. When we told her "not at this moment", she stormed off. When we had questions about the menu, she seemed exasperated and was not very helpful. Throughout the evening, she did not come check up on us. From the angle where I was sitting, I saw her talking with her co-workers while ignoring the guests. The only time when she was quick to service was giving us the bill. WOW. 

When you're spending $$$$$ at a restaurant, the dining experience should be impeccable, but instead, we were left with more to be desired.
