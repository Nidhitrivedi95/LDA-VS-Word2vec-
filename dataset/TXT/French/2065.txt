0pNhkIpD_RK0SVnuIo-sKA The highlight of a visit to a very weird museum. We were starving and hesitant to eat here, but are so glad we went.

Yes, we had to wait a bit because it was a busy lunch hour, but they were friendly and attentive in their service once we were seated (well, except the waiter forgot to bring the mayo I requested, but I didn't bother reminding him).

We had their version of a kir royal (sparkling wine with their ice cider) and it was a perfect start. Then I had the quesadilla (odd choice, I know, but I was in the mood) which came with fries and a small green salad. My boyfriend had the meat of the day, which was veal rib and was to die for. It came with a salad to start, then the rib which was meltingly tender, atop some garbanzo beans, pureed parsnip, and I think roasted eggplant. Then a dessert to finish--blueberry cake with blueberry cream cheese frosting and a peanut custardy thing with crushed peanuts on top. They also brought me one, even though I didn't order the meal--so yummy! It also came with coffee at the end, a nice finish.

The pacing of the meal was relaxed and friendly, and we left there SO HAPPY.
