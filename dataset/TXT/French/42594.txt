LI2gZ017EM3_5gy8Z1QR9w I came here for a birthday party and can say it was truly enjoyable!  The food was amazing....I am not a fan of liver but fried it was out of this world!  The fish course I had was delicious and done to perfection.  

If you need a place where it is cozy and the food beyond tasty then I encourage you to drop by and spend some time here!
