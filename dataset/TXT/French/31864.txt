gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA I remember this place being amazing, but I also remember being there with the most beautiful girl I've ever dated.  Food was delicious, wine was good too, and the bill was the highest I've ever paid for two people... somewhere in the $500 range.  We did get a corner booth with the most amazing view, and that didn't cost anything extra.
