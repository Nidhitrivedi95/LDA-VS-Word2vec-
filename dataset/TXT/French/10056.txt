4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Found this place on accident. I was looking for something to eat at 4:30 on a Sunday and most places were closed until 5PM. I was starving and couldn't wait, so  after trying nearly ever where in the Bellagio, I gave up and headed for the Strip.  I noticed a few people braving the 106 degree weather on the patio at Mon Ami and figured their must be a reason. 

The hostess was a little self involved, and initially tried to seat us outside, even though we requested an inside table. We compromised and settled for a table in the shade . 

I started with the Gazpacho, and my friend ordered the French Onion Soup. Both were tasty. The French Onion featured a  mountain of cheese, and the gazpacho was refreshing, with just a hint of basil. 

I went with the Bacon Wrapped pork tenderloin for dinner. What could be better than pork wrapped in pork? Seriously. It was good, if a little overdone for my taste. However, I did enjoy the potato puree and the Cherry Port sauce that accompianed it. My friend went with a Market tomato salad and the Crab Cake and Gribiche Sauce.  The tomatoes were fresh and delicious and the Crab Cake was excellent. 

I ordered a glass of the LaRouche Pinot Noir.  I think it suffered from setting on the rolling wine cart in the 106 degree heat.  

Dessert was Bananas Foster and Creme Brulee. Both were delicious,  as was the coffee. 

Mon Ami is very reasonably priced for a restaurant on the Strip, and the food is good. I probably would have gone with three starts though if not for the excellent service provided by our amazingly hot waiter Matthew. Seriously. I am rarely ever speechless, but this one rendered me mute.
