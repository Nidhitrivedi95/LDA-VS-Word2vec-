MdjIl105vqCYUGKFSUVytA My friend organized a pre-wedding celebration dinner at Colette Grand Cafe. The interior at Colette is very cute, the theme of our area is a tiffany-blue colour. It was a wonderful experience! Service was excellent, the staff were so friendly and attentive to our needs.

* FRENCH ONION SOUP (4.5/5)
(Sherry, sourdough, gruyère)
I loved the onion soup! A great portion of melted cheese and onion pieces. It came nice and hot. There were also fried onion pieces on the top, giving the soup more texture.

* STRIPLOIN & FRITES (4/5)
(Red wine butter & bordelaise jus)
Delish! I was surprised when our server didn't ask us how we wanted our meat but it was all good because my striploin came medium-rare, which I prefer. The fries were actually the highlight of the dish. Loved the dipping sauce as well!

* VANILLA ICE CREAM PROFITEROLE (5/5)
(Caramel cream & warm chocolate sauce)
My favourite part of the meal.. desserts! The ice cream was deep fried and it wasn't oily and overly filling. We were stuffed by the time the desserts came, but there's always room! Highly recommending this dessert - lots of flavour :)
