hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA Owner/Chef Olivier is super friendly and introduced himself as I perused the menu- opted to get two sandwiches to share with my guy (the Eggplant and the Chipotle) along with a cup of the soup of the day (roasted red pepper). Sandwiches were made fresh to order, brought out wrapped up tight and hot to the touch. Wait time was a reasonable ten minutes.

Chipotle was delish, with chipotle sauce, chicken, bacon, avocado, and pepper jack cheese- lots of flavor and a tiny bit of kick without too much spice.
Eggplant sandwich was better than expected, with fresh-grilled veggie, mozzarella, and tomato pesto, served on a fresh and chewy baguette that held up despite the moisture of the sauces and the ample amount of stuffing in the sandwich itself.

Soup was good and clearly homemade- flavorful and creamy without feeling heavy. Cup is a tiny portion, BF inhaled it and I barely got a taste. Didn't expect him to enjoy this flavor but it was gone so fast, he must have! ;)

Wish hours were more convenient for early dinners or weekends to visit regularly. 

TIP: Location can be difficult to find. From Sunset, turn into the office park and wind your way to the very back (towards the highway). Yes, you can get here without being on the 215 access road.
