We were no more than 5 mins late b/c the taxi took us to Rue Prince Arthur West instead of East.  Food was nice, wine was nice, atmosphere was lovely.  Toward the end of our  already 2 hour meal we really struggled to get someone's attention so we could get going, but eventually got the check. I think overall it's solid bet to experience some French cusinethe neighborhood.
