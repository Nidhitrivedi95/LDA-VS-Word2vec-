bEVWHtBRYVwqaaNF4mWNYg Went to Coquine for dinner over the weekend since good friend of mine who is a chef recommended for the nice French/Italian cuisine. 

The decor was nice. It was very classy and warm feeling. Maybe I am biased but I am not so into the modern interior decor that many other new restaurants are trying to put - Spring Rolls as an example. I just don't feel too comfortable in that type of sleek setting. Coquine gave me that nice relaxing mood for a date with some vibes. 

We've ordered Antipasto Platter for Two. It was good especially the size was probably good to share for 4 people. 

I ordered Seafood Linguine and I've loved it. Generally whenever I go to a new restaurant, I try to pick the most expensive ones in the category. I have learned this from my chef friend. Since a restaurant gets less orders of more expensive dishes, more skilled kitchen staffs are usually responsible for making them and pay more attention. Also, it is good measuring stick to assess the quality of dishes on the menu. 

Anyway, my partner ordered Pan Seared Jumbo Shrimp & Sea Scallops to follow the same rule! This was also very good that it clearly demonstrated the sautee skills by the kitchen staffs there. Scallops are perfectly cooked with shrimps. 

Both of us really enjoyed the dinner there and the only down side was that I think we ordered a wrong wine to pair with these good dishes. We ordered Chardonnay, and I think the dishes we had were probably better matched with Pinot Grigio. But I can't blame them because it was my choice.
