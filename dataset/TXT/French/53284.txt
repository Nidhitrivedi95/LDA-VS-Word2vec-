QeFsIMcIFIJcOrpthYL8jg Certainly one of the better options I found in Old Montreal. Ambiance is a kind of classy casual, but also reasonably priced and unpretentious - a seemingly hard balance to find in the area. The live jazz was great, volume level was just right, and it was very easy to feel comfortable there.

The waitress struggled a bit with English, which is absolutely fine, as I don't expect fluent English in a primarily French speaking area. The reason I bring it up at all is because despite her not being fully fluent, she was still very friendly and not at all impatient with our mixed English and poor attempts at French. It was nice to be able to try the bit of French my girlfriend and I know without feeling judged at all for it, which isn't something I can say for some of the other places I dined and visited.

Food and mixed drinks were quite good. Not outstanding, but certainly a satisfying and enjoyable meal. But it was the atmosphere and music that really sold me on Modavie.

Absolutely recommended for a comfortable, fun, and reasonably priced option in Old Montreal.
