t1mR_Zff6Dqv1TueE2JLEA I came here last night for the Summerlicious with a friend and I was not disappointed in spite of my fears.  The place was quite busy for an early dinner (6 pm) on a Monday night! The reviews on here are a mixed bag, but I made a point to avoid the chicken and Moroccan "treats" from the dessert menu. Thanks for the tips ;-)

We ordered the following and I've included descriptions from the menu:

MAFTOUL - "Hand rolled "Moroccan Cigars", hot crispy pastry stuffed with a mixture of mildly spiced beef, cashews and raisins, topped with our chipotle aioli." 

- I was hoping for more with this app. The serving size was tiny and the flavor wasn't as rich as I expected. It was okay, but next time I'd probably order the salad with duck slices, which my friend ordered.


MOROCCAN BEEF SHORT RIB - "Tender fall off the bone beef braised with Moroccan spices, finished with a rich red wine demi-glace, served with Yukon gold-parsnip mash, accompanied by mini Casablanca vegetables"  

- This was deceptively filling; the plate was more than half empty to start with, but I felt completely satisfied afterward. The meat was incredibly tender and seasoned to perfection. Potatoes and veg were full of rich flavour.


BRULÉE ROYALE - "A rich and flavourful crème brulée"  

- This is probably the best crème brulée I've had in a long time. The highlight of the meal!

This place isn't about eating "light". The food is rich and filling, but the quality is excellent. I'm not sure if I'd pay full price at the Sultan's tent for the show, but it looks like fun (maybe a good place to throw a party).

There was a bit of a wait to place our order but the service was very good after that. The only negative comments I have are regarding the air conditioning and wine: the air was BLASTING the whole time and I was nearly shivering after dinner was over. I don't think they need to keep it so cold.  The waiter admitted that ordering a half-liter of wine for $24 would amount to about 1 and a quarter glass each for two people.  This seems pricey when you consider that one glass was $8.75 - there is no incentive to order larger quantities if you're looking for value, but I guess that must be how they make their profits.
