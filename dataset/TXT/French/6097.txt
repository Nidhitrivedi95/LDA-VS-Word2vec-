3uC7Lbc3RgUDTWQlBu4PqQ I swooned with envy on numerous occasions looking at everyone's yelp pictures of the fabulous macarons Bouchon Bakery puts out daily. However, during the course of my covetous enchantment Honolulu (my hometown) seemed to have caught on to the macaron craze and now i'm thrilled to see that there's a bunch of places serving up these delightful treats in my own backyard. So when I FINALLY got the chance to try Bouchon Bakery this summer it sort of lost it's appeal. BUT, I had to give Bouchon a try since this is the first place I fell in love (at first sight) with macarons to begin with.

So I decided to try the pistachio macaron, a chocolate croissant and a TKO (Thomas Keller Oreo). These are mega macarons, almost twice the size of the usual sold elsewhere. It was delish.I only wish they made smaller sizes so that different flavors can be tried. The chocolate croissant was just okay, maybe because I bought mines in the evening so perhaps it was not as fresh. I was also infatuated with the TKO because who doesn't love a homemade oreo cookie? It was good, but the white filling was a little too sweet for my liking.

Prices were: TKO ($3.25), Chocolate Croissant ($4.00) and macaron ($3.50). No tax was added on so total came out to $10.75.

Location of this kiosk:  The Venetian, under the escalator near the Phantom Theater (or whatever they may have re-named it by now).

So now that I had my thrill filled, would I go back? Let's just say I wouldn't go out of my way to get something from here. BUT if I happen to be in the Venetian I wouldn't mind checking it out again.

My overall rating is 3.5 Stars.
