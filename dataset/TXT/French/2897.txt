0Xr0kte9ADAfZ-GBO-wimg I did not enjoy my experience at this restaurant at all. I went to this restaurant with a group of 7 friends on a Friday night. Most of us ordered the seafood linguine and the daily pasta (farfalle with shrimp and beef in rose sauce). First of all, the food is extremely bland. They seem to use the same bland sauce on many pastas, which make them taste pretty much the same. The price was too high for the quality of the food. Second of all, refills on pops are not free, and they do not inform you that beforehand. Only when you get the bill you find out the two little glasses of ice tea cost about 6 bucks. Third of all, the service is just awful. Our waiter was plain rude to us at the end of the meal. He almost just threw the bills on the table. And finally, the overall ambiance is mediocre at its best. Needlessly to say, I will never set my foot at this restaurant again. The only upside to eating at this restaurant is that you don't need to wait to be seated. Well, one can only wonder why...
