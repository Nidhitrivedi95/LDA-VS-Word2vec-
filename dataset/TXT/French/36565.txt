i5vxtyiHKYnRcJ0p9N7mLw Coming from an Italian family, I know the importance of having a reliable Italian deli in your neighborhood. But there's been a gap since the New Jersey Deli closed in North Phoenix years ago. I'm happy to say my heart is full again knowing Carlo & Emilie's is nearby. 

Carlo is a wonderful business owner. On my dad's birthday, he insisted I take him a loaf of his favorite bread, and I came back soon after to let him know my dad loved it.

The food is comforting and consistently delicious. I've had the soups, sandwiches, salads and desserts and I've left happy every time.

On your next visit, try any of the hot subs or a slice of tiramisu.
