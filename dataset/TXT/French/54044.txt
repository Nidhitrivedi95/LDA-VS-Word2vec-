qTacF-_Iucc1Nxom_Za_5Q Great place for a casual dinner with friends! Tables and portion sizes are small as you can tell from the $7 price tag on most items. We got 6 plates between 3 people for dinner. 
Order one of the signature cocktails, they are so creative and well presented!

Lost a star because I showed up before my friends and the host awkwardly asked how long they would be because he wanted the table back for other guests. Rude as there wasn't even a line, just one other group waiting!
