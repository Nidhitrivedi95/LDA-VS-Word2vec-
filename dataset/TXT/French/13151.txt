4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Looking forward to going back to Vegas for Mon Ami! Loved their food, the atmosphere is beautiful, and the staff is super friendly! 

It was one of the only sunny days in Vegas while we were there and we got to enjoy a wonderful lunch in the middle outdoor/indoor area. 

Everything we tried at the table was good. Even the bread... I wanted to eat it all but couldn't because I wanted to save room for everything else! I had the lobster roll and I really enjoyed it. So light yet buttery and just the right amount of crisp. Tried the baked brie and scallops as a starter and wow I was blown away. The scallops were super cheesy but really, really good. The brie speaks for itself, who doesn't love brie! 

We also shared 2 salads at the table. I believe one was a kale salad and I forget what the other one was... but they were both once again... really good!

Shared the creme brulee for dessert and had no complaints there- was yummy till the last bite :)

You won't be disappointed, give it a try!
