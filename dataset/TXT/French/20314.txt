And that's how our lunch began at Metro Brasserie on a warm February day.  You Phoenix yelpers don't know how lucky you are to be able to wear short-sleeves in February!!

I'm not really a fan of French food and find it too heavy for lunch, but I can usually find something to eat on any menu.  And that something to eat at Metro Brasserie was the chicken salad sandwich served on a croissant.  Our waiter told me it was one of their more popular sandwiches. Gabi K ordered a chick pea/eggplant sandwich, while the 3rd member of our party went with the turkey/cranberry sandwich.

About 20 minutes later the turkey/cranberry sandwich arrived, but there was no sign of our meals for another 15 or so minutes. Our waiter apologized profusely and said he didn't know why it was taking so long.  I was about to eat my arm by now (being on Chicago time it felt like an hour later), but we waited and waited and waited very patiently.

Once our food FINALLY arrived I really enjoyed the chicken salad sandwich...especially cause it was very light on the mayo. I hate mayo...ick.  Gabi really liked her sandwich as well, although the turkey/cranberry sandwich went untouched because the 3rd member of our party was not such a fan.  

At the end of the meal our waiter offered to bring us complimentary chocolate cake to make up for the wait of our food, but we declined...these hips do not need anymore chocolate cake.  Still, it was a sweet gesture.

Overall It was probably more of a 3 star experience, but I"m feeling a bit generous...the Arizona sun will do that to ya!
