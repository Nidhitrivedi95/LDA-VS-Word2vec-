i5vxtyiHKYnRcJ0p9N7mLw Stopped by casually after seeing the other reviews on yelp and i wasn't disappointed.

My wife and I shared a whole sandwich and it was more than enough.  We also really enjoyed the cream of potato soup.  You could definitely tell it was homemade.

The highlight of the trip may have been the chocolate mouse.  

Service was great.  They'll pretty much make you whatever you want if they have the ingredients.  

I wish i lived closer so i could go back more often.
