VQkrYJgDZIDsnaphQh1ZDw Osco is a modern French establishment located at the InterContinental. The service here is very good. Great wine list as well. The food is also great. I had a risotto and duck confit. While the duck was not the best I've had, it was still very good and prepared to my expectations. Risotto was good, too.
