Qc8kNFkr5q4xNah4iC0haw What can I say? I love Edinburgh and I love this restaurant/bar!
Everything we tried was absolutely delicious even the haggis and especially the MINI fish and chips! Don't get me started with the sticky pudding.  Seriously that was the MOST memorable thing we had on our trip! No lie, it is one of the MUST thing you have to eat before you die. LOVE LOVE everything and the great staff!
