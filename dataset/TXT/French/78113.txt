YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g If you can't make it to Fleur De Lys and looking for something close to it and more affordable, this would NOT be the place. Fleur is totally different than Fleur De Lys but still has its own uniqueness and taste. It was definitely tasty and ambient! Most memorable dishes were the oysters with orange sorbet and special sauce: served on top of  the dry ice presentation; interesting flavor combo!  The house made Ice cream and sorbet: came out looking like delicious soap bars and had an original taste.
