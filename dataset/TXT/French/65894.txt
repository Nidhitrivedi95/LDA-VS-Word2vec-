Ud5FqhVC8AdZg9RLzNW_Wg What a neighbour jem! We tried it because of all the positive reviews and it lived up to the expectation. We had the duck confit, steak frites, pork belly, escargot and daily fish special. They were all great!!! My favourite was the duck confit, the sauce was decadent. Dave our Server was beyond friendly and accommodating. Chef Jason is a one man show and catered to the full restaurant. Did I mention half price wine Wednesdays??? Selfish part of me don't want it to blow up so we can always go there but I want to make sure they get the 5 star rating they deserve will definitely return. Welcome to the neighbourhood!
