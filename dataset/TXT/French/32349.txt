gxMa7j1LXIUxxBoP0osDpA Consistency is their problem.

Was a regular at this place but lately their food has gone down the hill.
Last Sunday 4 of us ordered foie gras, all burned and overcooked.
Then came the fish of the day. Undercooked. Inside was raw, and had absolutely no flavour/salt at all.  My deer was lack of seasoning as well. 

Almost,almost sent the dishes back to the kitchen, but didn't wanna taste chef's 'special treatment' after people send food back to the kitchen if you know what i mean. 

I'm not going back here again.
