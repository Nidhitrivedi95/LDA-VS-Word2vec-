HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw Good restaurant at the Cosmo. They have indoor and outdoor seating though the heater outside was busted. The food was pretty good. I enjoyed the mac and cheese and the rib eye the most. Dessert was good with a large variety. The macarons were a tad disappointing though, the shell was too flaky and crunchy.  Service was really very attentive and friendly.
