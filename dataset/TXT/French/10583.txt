4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I was immediately turned off from Mon Ami Gabi because of the cool, indifferent service. Ok, I get it. Youre a "French" restuarant and the French have a rep for being snooty, but get a grip Mr. Waiter, sir. Youre from friggin Fresno not Paris! Ok...end rant. Their signature drink, the Mon Ami Margarita is great. I would have ordered more than one if our waiter  decided to come back and check on us within a reasonable time frame. 

The food is okay. I really didnt have anything that stood out for me. The mussels were good but a distant second to how enjoyable I found their margarita. But here is where Mon Ami Gabi gets ridiculous. We ordered french onion soup. It was GROSS. What the hell?! Its french onion soup. Youre a french themed restaurant. All the baked Gruyere cheese in the world couldnt have saved that soup. Id eat my hand if you put enough cheese on it, but no way would I eat this soup.  My entree was the roasted chicken with mushrooms and frites. The chicken was very flavorful albeit quite dry but the frites were really good. 

If you decide you must eat here sit on the patio, watch the Bellagio fountains ,get a mon ami margarita, and fill up on your frites.
