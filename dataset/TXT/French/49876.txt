oS96aJIHFWcFAlGHKKXjaw This is a really great bakery and pastry shop.  I appreciate that they have some savory options as well, such as quiche (I'm considered myself not a fan of quiche before this visit but am now thinking I have just had some really dry, inferior quiches up to this point) and sandwiches.

We had:
- Coffee
- Vegetarian quiche (yum)
- Brioche Bostock (this was my favorite - If you like dense bread and almond cream/extract flavors, you will like this)
- Chocolate croissant
- One more thing that I can't remember the name of that was described as being similar to bread pudding.  It was good, but I thought it was more of a cross between a custard and bread pudding because it was really smooth (no bread bits) and creamy/eggy.
