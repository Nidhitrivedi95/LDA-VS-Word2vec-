4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Had another great meal. Service was great and food was delicious. 

For breakfast we had:

Warm baguette. Amazing.
Chicken, apple, Brie crepe was delicious. Savory and slightly sweet.
Also had an amazing omelette. 

We'll be back.
Consistently knocks it out of the park. Went back and had another amazing breakfast. Try bananas foster waffles. Not overly sweet somehow and so delicious.
