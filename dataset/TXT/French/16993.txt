9ET_RUNztevq4_OLAX80Gg Not really a 3 star more like a 2 and a half star restaurant.

The menu is very limited and nothing great.

There wines are way over priced.

There service is just OK .

The decor and seating is also nothing great 

We were also seated at a booth where there was a serving station directly behind me and all I could hear is plates being prepared.

Our Toronto restaurant management and or owners including this one need to go and take lessons from other restaurants in other cities in the USA and around the world.
