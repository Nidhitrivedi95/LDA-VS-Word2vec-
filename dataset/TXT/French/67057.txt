I got some pumpkin cheesecake and my date got the beignets. We stated to our server that we were probably going to share dessert with each other which usually means we should get some extra plates to divvy up the goods. Well was I super surprised when they brought out 2 desserts of each for us gratis! Was this be super nice to Jimmy day and I wasn't aware of it?! The beignets were light fluffy and fatty forming an excellent pairing with the creme and coffee. While the pumpkin cheesecake, oh god my pumpkin cheesecake. I am convinced it is the food of the gods, so creamy, so pumpkiny, with a buttery savory crust. Oh I was so tempted to lick the plate. We ate on a couch in front of the cozy fireplace, perfect.

I'm going to have to return here soon to sample more of their food and see how it fares.
