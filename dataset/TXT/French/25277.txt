Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA The food here was pretty good. I got the spicy crab salad which was great, my mom got the lobster that was pretty good to,but not as good as the spicy crab salad.  For our main course I got the filet mignon with foie gras on top. The foie gras had an eggy taste at least it did to me,my mom thought it was good.
