t1mR_Zff6Dqv1TueE2JLEA I went last night with a few friends. Ratings per below:

Belly dance - actually deserves a 4 star, the dance was so good, AND pretty and friendly, I would give her a tip if there's a choice. Note we only had 1 dancer for about 40 min, I heard there were supoosed to be more than 1... well. 

Food - deserves a 2.5 star... we used the coupon from travelzoo so we didn't oder anything that has additional charges to them, they may taste better but if that's the case, I would give this place a 1 star just because i would feel scammed

Harira - good soup, might be spicy for some. but i felt like they just got this from the beef stew and added water and some spices...

Maftoul - very good, my favorite couse, sauce on it was amzing, and the actual roll was crunchy enough

Beef short ribs - when it was brought to me, i thought omg this looks so delicisous, the meat falls right off the bone and the mashed potato has the golden colour to it. but after one bit, beef was so dry, and potato was too cold and hard for my like. i had less than 1/2 and couldn't finish it.

Moroc treat - 0 star dessert!! this was the worst of it all, what a joke, with two slices of oranges and two pieces of super sweet (not in a good way) marshmallow looking candies...

I do like their Mint tea...


Services - our waiter was so unfriendly, and i wasn't even sure if he's just been cool or mean?... he didn't do anything bad, it's more like he didn't do anything. and i can't believe the 15% gratitute was mandatory, i guess they know their service isn't the greatest so if it's not mandatory, not many people is willing to give much. and the 15% was on top of the full price (pre coupon), it doesn't make sense because i wouldn't come here if i'm paying the full price. 

this is my longest review so far and i hate to do this for a 2 star place, but felt like i have to... for the benefit of curious georges out there.
