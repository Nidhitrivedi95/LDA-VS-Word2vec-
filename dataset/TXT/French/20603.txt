AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw We went on a family trip and my father had not been to Vegas in years so we gave him the grand tour of all the hotels.  While we were browsing I saw this really pretty patisserie.  I thought to myself... why not check it out!

Wow, what a wast of money.  I looked and looked at the baked goods but nothing popped out at me.  My sister went after I did and she walked out scoffing at what they offered as well as the prices.  Okay I know we are in Vegas and things tend to be pretty expensive... but that does not mean you should pay a lot for bad tasting food! 

The only reason I wanted something really bad was to put it on my website and since the store looked pretty I wanted to give it a try.  I was keeping an open mind and giving it a chance.  I wasted $10 for a bag of 6 or so mignardises.  They were bland and had a gritty texture.  I almost gagged eating this.

So not worth the money! It is pretty to look at but do not waste your money here.  There are many bakeries 100x better than here!
