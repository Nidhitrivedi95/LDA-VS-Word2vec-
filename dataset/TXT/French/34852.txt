HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw My fiancé and I did some research on Vegas happy hours and came across Comme Ca. We have fallen in love with this place. Not only are the specials awesome (50% off cocktails and bar menu items) but the service is great (Alex, Melissa and JD have helped us these last few nights and couldn't have been cooler!) You can sit at the bar or any of the bar tables to enjoy the specials which is nice too. I'm really loving the new drink, "Catcher In Her Rye" which is delicious. These drinks are real cocktails made with thought and care to send you off on your night. We are definitely going to miss this place when we head home. A special find in a very cool hotel!
