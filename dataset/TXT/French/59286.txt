rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w My wife and I did Vegas for Christmas last year for the first time. We booked a nice dinner for Christmas day, but decided to wing it on Christmas Eve. As the dinner hour arrived, we wandered over to the Bellagio to check on a couple of options. Our first few choices were booked for the evening, but Le Cirque had a table for two for immediate seating.

We had been to Le Cirque two years earlier for my wife's birthday, and it is by far one of the best meals that we have ever had. She is not afraid to announce Le Cirque as her favorite restaurant. 

We were elated to be seated at the same table and to be served by the same server as we had during our last visit. Le Cirque is a fairly intimate setting without feeling crowded or stuffy. The service is timely, but not pushy. The Christmas Eve menu was simple, you could choose from one of two tastings: the Chirstmas tasting, or the Christmas Truffle tasting. Since this was an "unplanned" dinner we chose to stick closer to our budget and have the $155.00 standard Christmas tasting as opposed to the $255.00 truffle menu.

I decided against a wine pairing, but had Michael (our server) choose a nice glass of Pinot that arrived for our main course. Everything was sensational. Le Cirque knows how to deliver the complete package. It still ranks at the top of our dining experiences. We will be back.
