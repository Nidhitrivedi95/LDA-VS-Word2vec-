eJ9L40jm5VOXCIq7xs9kQw Great French food in super nice fancy setting. Great place for date, celebration, get together, business dinner.  We got the $79 tasting menu and it was worth it- you also get the prix fixe meal or order a la carte.  The highlights were the duck breast, vanilla shrimp and scallops.  This place provides a fantastic french dining experience with super attentive wait staff who offers excellent service. Delicious cocktails and superb wine choices. Enjoy!
