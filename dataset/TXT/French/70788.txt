XbG4OgFoaSIxQxVRhTxU2w Having moved here from Texas, I wasn't sure about the "Southern" label on Kitchenette. Turns out they didn't mean "down home, authentic Southern," they meant "upscale, chef-driven thoughtful Southern" which is a-okay. A menu that sounds straight-up heavy is twisted and turned until each piece is a lighter, more complex, tastier version of its inspiration. Lobster roll was the best my wife had ever had anywhere, the chicken-fried beet salad (no, seriously) was fantastic and surprising and while calling what I had for a side "sweet potato tater tots" was a bit of a stretch, they were as unique and wonderful as everything else. 

Mississippi Mud Pie for dessert was fair but uninspired, service was nice but slow and not very good at keeping track of the room even on a slow Wednesday night. Prices are a bit high but you feel like you know where the money went when you eat.
