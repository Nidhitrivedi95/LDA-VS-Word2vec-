mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q I was so excited to eat at a Joel Robuchon restaurant and I got more than I expected. 

My bf and I ordered the tasting menu ($155 per person) with wine pairing (additional $105 per person). Including the amuse buche, there were 9 courses. 

The dishes were so innovative. 

My 2 favs were the foie gras parfait and egg cocotte. MMmmm....just thinking about it makes me drool. OMG the foie gras stuffed quail was to die for!!!!

One of the best fine dining restaurants I've ever been to. I love how we sat by the "bar" where we could look at the magic in the kitchen. I've never been able to see the chemistry in a fine dining restaurant unitl I dined at L'Atelier. Dining here was a wonderful experience!

Note: The place is pretty small and you'll most likely sit next to a stranger. Don't expect an intimate setting (go to Alex inside Wynn for that). Do expect wonderful, innovative art....I mean food. 

(I also included a pic of our tasting menu from that night)
