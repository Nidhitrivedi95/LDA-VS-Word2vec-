Yp1swb-8pO8i-6-jaK2tsA So so disappointing. We've been coming here for years and have many fond memories here but obviously the franchise or at least this location has changed hands and it's horrible. We ordered the appetizer trio - the zucchini was undercooked and barely battered, the chicken strips were flavorless, we barely got 10 overheated (with a heat lamp) chips for our greasy, gloppy artichoke dip. The bread basket was hard and a sad attempt at presentation. The food was too salty, the salad was hot and wilted under the heat lamp before being served and even something as simple as tomato soup was so bad it was barely edible even with a grilled cheese. The pumpkin spice muffin had a huge glop of cream cheese icing inside and barely tasted like pumpkin at all. They only had 4 tables in the place and the rest sat full of trash and glasses. It took almost a full minute to be greeted at the door. And a sandwich with a side salad, pot roast with mashed potatoes, a half grilled cheese with a cup of tomato soup, an appetizer, a sprite and a tea was $73!! Unreal. All the charm and quality is gone. Another one bites the dust.
