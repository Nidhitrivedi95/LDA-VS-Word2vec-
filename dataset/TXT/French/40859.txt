kcF-en40P3J9L8nLy5lKqQ The menu sounds amazing. I was wishing I could taste several things on the menu but, I knew I wouldn't make rent if I did. 
$9 to add salmon, French Onion soup is $12

Try the Power Lunch special or the 
1/2 & 1/2 with a salad, soup or sandwich. 

I had the Kale Salad with Chicken. 
The Kale was fresh and nicely chopped and the chicken was perfectly seasoned and grilled. Served warm on the greens, just the way I like it. As for the rest of the salad mehh.

The cranberries were hard and dry, the feta was too spare to add anything and the walnuts that were suppose to be candied.....were plain. The honey mustard didn't seem to be a good match so I asked for the lemon vinaigrette. Too tart to be edible! 
I would suggest golden raisins, goat cheese and or some kind of coating on the walnuts spicy-sweet would help. 
And salad dressings should compliment not compete with the salad. 
Service, setting and decor are spot on!
