gxMa7j1LXIUxxBoP0osDpA Chose to try out this place on a celebratory dinner date after reading rave reviews on Yelp, and so glad I did. I found the space to be surprisingly compact, but the atmosphere was bright and bustling. It was not the most intimate or romantic of dates, but we really enjoyed our time here, mainly because the food was so good.

I had the scallops for starters, and they came in a delicious but heavy-ish sauce. Although I appreciated all the flavors of the dish, to me scallops should speak for themselves, and I thought these scallops were hidden a little too much by the big flavors of the rest of the dish. However, my date disagreed with me completely and unequivocally LOVED this dish, so what do I know?

For mainsies I had the venison medallions. What made this dish so great was that the medallions were cooked to perfection -- As in, they literally could not have been more perfectly cooked. When I originally moved to Montréal, I was surprised to find I had difficulty getting a steak in a restaurant that was cooked just the way I liked it -- they all tended to come out overdone. (To be fair, I may have been going to all the wrong places, but it was such a frustrating experience that I actually stopped ordering steak all together.) The venison medallions at O'Thym, however, will stand out in my memory as one of the best-executed dishes that I have ever ordered, in Montréal or elsewhere.
