OkC86YtZ0Nm19my5F4GGrQ My husband and I went out with friends to this restaurant that was recommended by a mutual acquaintance. (There were four of us) We wanted to check out the Old Detroit road area for a while now and this seemed like a good opportunity. This is a quaint little restaurant not much seating inside, but it was too cold yet to sit outside. The bar area is part of the restaurant proper with a large back room for parties. The wait staff were very polite and made sure to look out for customers needs. We made reservations about a month prior, we show up and the restaurant is full with no table waiting for us. We were told to sit at the bar and wait a little bit. We waited for an hour after I had to flag down the hostess and manger to ask why they didn't hold our reservation. We were making plans to go to any of the numerous other restaurants in the area when we were finally seated. The manager comped our drinks which was very nice, however two members of our table didn't have any alcoholic drinks. Overall the food was well prepared and deserts were fresh and tasty. I do recommend the fromage plate the pickled onions were very good. Overall I would recommend this place if you're in Rocky River and don't mind waiting. I'm sure they are able to accommodate more when the patio is open, but they shouldn't depend on that. I would have rated them higher if they didn't take reservations, we would have planned to be there earlier and dealt with the wait. When I have a reservation I plan on being seated within 15 minutes of arrival.
