oS96aJIHFWcFAlGHKKXjaw Gourmandine is a terrific, reasonably priced, neighborhood French bakery. Except for maybe the Paris-Brêst and one of the chocolate desserts, everything I have gotten from there has been delicious and very reasonably priced. And I've tried most everything in the case, counters, and shelves! The owner is lovely and the staff are usually extremely helpful. They can be a bit curt if the store is very busy, but otherwise are pleasant and quick. The pastries aren't too sweet, and they have enough seasonal things on offer to keep me interested. I especially like their winter Religieuse. In the summer the fresh berries on the Macaron aux Fruits are great, and the cakes are exquisite.

This is a must-eat place, but be sure to show up early if you want the best selection. I find that it comes in waves. On a Saturday or Sunday it is best to arrive either at open or around 11.
