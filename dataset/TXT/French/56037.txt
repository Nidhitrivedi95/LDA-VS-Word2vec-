rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A We've heard and seen on the Food Network great things about Bouchon and certainly was not disappointed with the service. The dining hall is elegant and proper. Brunch was good, but not blow- your- mind great. We tried the Salmon Baguette, a take on salmon and smear on a bagel only for $15, but this is to be expected. Nevertheless, it was good. We also had the Bouchon French Toast which is done in a bread pudding- like style. It shouldn't be be called French toast because it does not resemble anything like it. It really should be called bread pudding. It was more like dessert-- too sweet to be had as a brunch meal.
