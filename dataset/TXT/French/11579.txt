4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Mon Ami Gabi is one of my favorite spots in Vegas, located in Paris, in the heart of the strip with easy access to the street. staff was very friendly and professional. Went their for Steak dinner which was cooked to perfection and as requested even though our table was huge with 15 people plus. All food came at the same time with the proper temperature. Waiter was attentive and courteous. Again, we hit Mon Ami Gabi for breakfast the next morning, as you know breakfast is very important in Vegas, and this venue is known to be the place for good breakfast and sure it was. Their breakfast menu is extensive with great diverse options. Had a great overall experience and will be looking forward to the next visit soon. The deserve every star.
