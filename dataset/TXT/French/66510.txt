uP3H5bcsiTXM0k0xQhRndg Tried to go for a dinner here yesterday. Waited for 15 minutes without any attention or acknowledgment at the door. The waitress who was working on the first floor first yelled at us and asked to wait behind the door so she can do her job faster and then when we tried to get other persons attention to ask a simple question how long do we have to wait for a table she sent that person away, came to us and started to yell that the faster she works the faster we can sit down. I am not used to that kind of "service". The food might be really good here but we didn't get to experience it because of the attitude of the wait staff. Do not recommend to go there unless you like to be yelled at.
