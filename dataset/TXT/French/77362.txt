YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g I always look forward to visiting a new celebrity chef restaurant but this one was a disappointment.   The issues started with the drink order, my cocktail selection was the blood orange margarita whereupon my server informs me that they are out of it.    really, is it that hard to send someone to the store to buy a bottle?   we were seated at 5:15 and dinner started at 5 so this is inexcusable in my book.   so we move on, and I select their version of a mimosa, which the menu says is made with prosecco.   I like this, because I'm not a huge fan of champagne.   however when he brings me the drink it tastes very bitter and certainly not the taste I was expecting.   so I mention this to the server and I am informed that they don't have prosecco so they make it with champagne. !!!    again, is it that hard to either (a) print a new menu or (b) buy a bottle of prosecco !!    in any event you do NOT under any circumstances make such a change to a drink without asking the patron first if this is acceptable !!!   Bartending/restauranteuring 101 people !!!!    moving on to the food, it was ok.   nothing to write home about.   much of it was very underseasoned or unseasoned altogether.   the pepper edamame was tasty, however, and the tacos although quite tiny were very spicy and nice.   the beef carpaccio was quite underwhelming as were the duck terrine and the quinoa stuffed peppers.   in summary, many other better choices in Vegas
