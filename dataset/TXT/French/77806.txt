YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g I really enjoyed this restaurant. We went small plate style and ordered a variety of dishes which were perfect sharing for the two of us. There was nothing to complain about. Our server was attentive and friendly. His recommendations were terrific (though he was up-selling), but regardless, all of them were delicious.

Our favorites were "In the shower" mac n cheese, tuna tacos, and burrata. Each dish was well balanced, distinct and rich. We also enjoyed the sangria which was refreshing and surprisingly " loaded. We finished dinner with the Pineapple Carpaccio: shaved pineapple on top of lime sorbet with a side of cilantro granite. I would strongly recommend this dessert, especially during the summer.

We wanted to try this place just once, however, have decided to put this establishment on our "Where to eat in Vegas" rotation list.
