QeFsIMcIFIJcOrpthYL8jg Very lovely, charming décor, old-style restaurant in the heart of Port Vieux, we arrived as they were opening up.  Did not know they served up live jazz at night, I missed out! Anyway, while visiting Montreal, I wanted to try my first poutine, I guess l found the right spot since they make their version with a generous portion of braised lamb. needless to say, it was awesome! 

Wife loved her French Onion soup, and her cheese platter. Overall experience was fantastic, I recommend this if you are a local, or visiting the city (first time, for the F1 race). Tres Magnifique!
