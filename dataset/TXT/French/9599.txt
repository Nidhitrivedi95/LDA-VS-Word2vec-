4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw So far this is my boyfriend & I's favorite dinner place in Las Vegas. We were given bread & spread as we were seated, with the spread being absolutely delicious. It was sweet & tart, which went perfect with the fresh bread. We also ordered seared ahi tuna salad & mac & cheese on the side; the tuna was perfectly seared and was seasoned to go with the salad dressing, but it was a bit pricey while the mac & cheese was just okay, nothing special. 

We both ordered the steak & fries. My boyfriend ordered the filet mignon merlot & I ordered the filet mignon au poivre. His was more sweet while mine had a peppercorn taste to it. They were both delicious, but I will admit the filet mignon merlot was better. 

Service is a big deal for me and this place had great service. Everyone was friendly. 

You should probably make reservations for dinner since it's usually busy. There's a great view of the Bellagio fountains out on the patio, but seats there are first come, first serve. We got lucky and got a seat inside right next to the window, which allowed us to be warm inside and still get a great view hehe :D
