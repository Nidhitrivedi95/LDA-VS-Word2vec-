sAOgSr6suAE4axjIFSbtLQ It has been a few weeks since I had an opportunity to get to The Wine Cellar.  First, it is great to have a nice cozy, comfortable place to go and have a bottle/glass of wine.  The wine bar attendant was very attentive and provided great recommendation based on my wife's brief description of what she wanted to drink.  "Red, full-bodied, fruit-forward!"  Just that simple!  And the two recommendations were fantastic.  My first taste of recommendation #1, convinced me that I did not need to try #2.  But as it turned out...both were fantastic and I have since added a few bottles to the TCB Cellar at home!  In addition to the great wines, were able to hear some good live jazz.  The performer was very good!  I look forward to returning to the Wine Cellar...and will sit at a table so that we can actually see the performance.  Don't get me wrong, sitting at the bar provided a great opportunity to talk about the wines and other offerings at the Wine Cellar.  I look forward to one day seeing some incentives on wine purchases...on some of their specialty items that seemed a little pricey.
