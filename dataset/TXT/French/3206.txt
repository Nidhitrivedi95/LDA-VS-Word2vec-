1Bt7cvkXamVTEZ8Mbjvrow We arrived on time and were seated in the upper floor. The service was well paced, the menu a little difficult to read fro our seats but otherwise fine. Where were we let down... a steak that was ordered rare was medium rare at one and and well-done (ie leather) at the other end. The irony was that we also ordered a vegetable brochette which was almost raw and uncooked. When your name has the word Steak in it, you better know how to cook a steak perfectly.....

While I'm not deducting points for this, I have to point out that the server (under orders from management) removed a plate while others were still eating. I know that this is normal practice in the US, but many people (including myself) think that this is rude and we should at least be asked if it's acceptable. It makes a guest feel like they are eating too slowly and the other(s) to sit uncomfortably as if they are rushing the other(s). It's a horrible standard and makes people at the table uncomfortable. Save us from this rudeness by simply either asking if you may remove the plate or waiting until all have finished.
