4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw What an awesome experience! The wait was a little longer than quoted but understandable; Sunday brunch and we wanted to be on the patio. When we were seated, the hostesses apologized. The food was pretty awesome but what really made our experience so awesome was our waitress and the staff. Cheryl was so amazing! We had a child with us who was a picky eater and she was so patient and accommodating; got the little guy everything he wanted. Throughout the meal, she was always so attentive and always made sure we had fresh bread (incredible). At the end of the meal, she showed us the rewards program. I can't say enough about how awesome she was! Will definitely come back on our next visit.
