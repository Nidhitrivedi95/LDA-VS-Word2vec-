ZgiSgTwHOoxdfi0unI36Mg Hotel bar alert! Don't expect to meet locals here.

Gazette is on the 1st floor of the Westin Hotel. For any SPG platinum members staying at the hotel, there is happy hour (5-7pm) complementary drinks and breakfast included.

My husband and I have stayed at the Westin Montreal a few times and prefer this hotel to any other in the Starwood group in MTL because of this bar. 

The bartender is the same from years ago--a sign that it is well managed. Service is excellent. We got draft Unibroue in full pints and watched FIFA games. Staff are super friendly. They played with our baby and will make recommendations if you are touring around town. 

For breakfast, they have a solid buffet. As a frequent Westin guest, I would say it is on par with any updated Westin in North America or Europe.
