4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw My friends and I visited over Spring Break and were very pleased with our experience!! The service was excellent! Glasses kept full of water, fresh loaves of bread with staff offering fresh garlic to accompany. We shared the escargot, which was by far the best choice I've made in a while, absolutely delectable!! We all opted for eggs Benedict, which were respectable for a French restaurant, and Prime steak sandwiches, which were by far the best! Definitely would recommend for your visit to Vegas!!!
