t1mR_Zff6Dqv1TueE2JLEA My friends treated me to dinner at the Sultan's Tent and it was a novel experience for me. 

The multicoloured tent itself is beautiful and there are unique chandeliers which hang from the top. The ambience was pleasing to the eye. The 4 course dinner was $40 and it was average. I had the cafe greens and they tasted like a generic salad. What stood out for me was the delicious maftoul, which was crispy pastry stuffed with beef and spices and drizzled with an amazing chipotle aioli. For my third course, I had the chicken Marakesh, and it was subpar, as was my creme brulee. That said, I enjoyed the entertaining and flexible belly dancers and one of my friends and I even got in on the action through participating in a dance. I have a new found appreciation for the art of belly dancing.

Our server was friendly and provided service with a smile. I thoroughly enjoyed the mint tea and the way she poured it into the glasses. I was very appreciative that my friends took me out to dinner here, as it certainly was a memorable experience!

On another occasion, I have also visited Cafe Moroc and while the chicken sandwich that I had was nothing special, I couldn't get enough of the fries!
