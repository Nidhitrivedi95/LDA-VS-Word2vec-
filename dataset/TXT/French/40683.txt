KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA I've been here twice now and both experiences were outstanding.  The first visit they had a free wine tasting and we ended up buying a bottle.  We also had lunch out on the patio overlooking the lake which was very nice.  My first lunch I had the BLT sandwich.  What made this unique is that it was made with crispy pork belly instead of bacon.  Yummy!

The second visit I had the salmon sandwich and it was delicious.  I paired it with a nice chardonnay and basically had a perfect lunch.  I like that on the wine selections they give the Wine Spectator or Robert Parker ratings.  That's the first time I've seen that on a menu and find it very helpful.

I like this place a lot and can't wait to come back!
