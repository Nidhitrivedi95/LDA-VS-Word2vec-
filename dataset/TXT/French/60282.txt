SBnpT6JDbah-5l_52GM5sw Would you like fries or a salad with that burger?...are never words you would hear here because you get both automatically when you order one! I've tried several burgers in the Madison area and I would consider myself somewhat of a knowledgeable resource when it comes to burgers around here. Sardine's has made #2 on my list for best burger I've had in Madison. (#1 being  the late night burger at Tornado room) 

I had a taste of both the house burger and the sardine burger. House burger you can't go wrong with. Has your standard toppings. However if you are feeling a little adventurous definitely go with the sardine burger. I was worried that the burger might be a little to sweet with both figs and caramelized onions on it but it was every bit savory as I wanted it to be. Note- that burgers can only be ordered at the bar or in the bar "area". 

Brunch here is amazing as well. They take reservations so you should make them! will save you a big hassle. Dinner is a little bit pricier than brunch and the bar menu but it is a nice place to take a date. They also have seating that faces the water so if you really want to impress someone when the weather is nice try to snag one of these tables! It's beautiful. 

I also applaud Sardine TREMENDOUSLY for being a restaurant that cares about where their fish are caught and sourced and tries to be sustainable. I know it's hard to do in the midwest but it is a serious issue and I'm glad they are taking the steps to be a restaurant that cares.
