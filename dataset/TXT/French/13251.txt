She said it was the specialty of the house; it didn't taste like prime...wait it didn't even taste like choice. I ordered the escargot and thought it had more bitter than what I would expect. Not much of the menu really seems French but the place is charming and has an awesome view of the fountains at Bellagio. The three stars are for the location mostly.
