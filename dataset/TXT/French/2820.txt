0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g When I think of "Fine Dining," I think of Picasso.  Food + Art = Culinary Arts at its finest.

From the original works by Picasso gracing the walls, to a waterside view of the Bellagio water show during dinner, the ambiance does not get any better than this.

The service in this Michelin two star rated restaurant is top notch.  The attentive servers never need to be asked to do anything for you, as they appear and disappear magically on cue, before one can even sense a need to have a glass refilled or move on to the next course of the meal.

And the prix fix menu created by Julian Serrano makes me drool all over myself whenever I think about it.  From the Amuse Bouche, to the U-10 Day Boat Scallops, to the Foix Gras (that hubby cannot stop raving about), all the way to dessert and delightful little gift box of petit fours they gave me as we left the restaurant, Picasso is definitely one of Vegas' finest.

I give this restaurant an A+ for Ambiance, Service and Fine Cuisine.

When making reservations, request a waterside table if you want some of the best seats for the Bellagio water show.
