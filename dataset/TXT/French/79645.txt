I had lobster salad on baguette. Was very good.  Baguette was especially good. Served with nice spring greens salad. Spouse had truffle burger. Said it was very good. Came with shoe string fries but the fries were very greasy & didnt eat them. Very clean & bright inside. Friendly, counter service. Would go again.
