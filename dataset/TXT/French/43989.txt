MdjIl105vqCYUGKFSUVytA The space is beautiful, they really did a great job with the décor. As per the service and the food, it's been a hit or miss over the 4 times I have been here. The food is definitely over-priced. While the tour de colette is beautiful and great to share over a beverage, $65 for a few pickled mussels, one crab knuckle, and a tiny bit of lobster salad with raw/cooked vegetables is not very justifiable. On the other hand, the foie gras was great and the ahi tuna was good. Steak was a steak. I really think this is a better spot for coffee or just drinks, rather than dinner.
