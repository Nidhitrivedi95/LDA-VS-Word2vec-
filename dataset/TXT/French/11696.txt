4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw This is my third time eating here and it reminds me of the bistros in Paris. We even ate on the patio even though it was still 100 degrees. This place is consistent with quality of food and service. 

The carafe of sangria was refreshing. Our server topped off our glasses throughout the entire meal. The usual baguette with whipped butter and carrot slaw came next.  It's a great baguette, not authentic, but pretty close. 

The French onion soup had a unique taste to it, like tomatoes were added to it(?). It tasted good, but not the traditional soup. The frisée bacon salad was too finely chopped. There were tons of little bacon pieces, which made it hard to chew. I think larger chunks would have worked better with the frisée. 

The artichoke app was very good, but lots of work to get just a little smudge off the leaves. They provided an instruction sheet on how to eat the app. The dressing was a bit sweet for me. A cheese fondue dip would have tasted better. 

Outstanding service!  Great location to relax and people watch or to just pretend you are in Paris.
