vg55SAkrEmuHpWfIMtJjBQ I loved this place .... one of the reasons My BF and I came here is because if the quality of the food and preparation. It was so very disappointing to find out they stopped using beef tallow to fry food and now have succumbed to low quality/poisonous vegetable oil! I hope they don't stop grass fed.
