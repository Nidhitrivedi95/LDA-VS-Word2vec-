gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA I picked Alizé based on all the reviews and so I had high expectations. Things started off well. We were seated instantly, right next to the windows. We looked over the menu. I would have opted for the 7 course tasting menu but before coming my friend and I had said we wanted lamb and duck, neither of which were on the tasting menu so we ordered the duck and lamb entrees, the grilled foie gras and the escargot for appetizers and finally a pumpkin soufflé for dessert.

Neither the foie gras or the escargot were all that great. The foie gras in particular was pasty tasting. The escargot could have been from any cheap seafood place and I wouldn't have noticed the difference. So, by that time I was a little disappointed for such high reviews.

Fortunately the duck and lamb saved the day. Both were wonderful as was the pumpkin soufflé.  I'd have given them a 5 if the appetizers has also been as tasty. The duck actually started off as not so good for me. It came with slice of duck, slices of foie gras sausage and some prepared vegetables in the middle. I started eating each one separately and was not impressed. Once I started eating them together though it was amazing. Similarly with the lamb. By itself it was not so great but if you mixed a bite with the vegetables and fruits that came with it it was delicious.

The only other thing I feel should be mentioned, they had one 2 person table that had no view. Since they advertise the place as having an amazing view they really owe it to their customers to remove that table. I saw one couple get seated there and then move when a table by the windows became free. If that couple had not been able to move I'm sure they would have left disappointed. You don't advertise $$$$ meals with a view and then not deliver on the view.
