3rj1qpgFvkRWtAka17mhEQ I have been here a few times already & it is a nice little spot. It is casual & it is a franchise. But, it's also unique in its own way. It has a very cozy feel to it. The food is very good. Whether you want breakfast, lunch or dinner. The food is always delicious. We started off with the spinach artichoke dip. Almost every restaurant has one. And, I really like their version. My only complaint, was that there were not enough tortilla chips. We asked for more, but we never got them. Our waitress was nice, but I think she had too many tables that night & was overwhelmed. The fresh bread basket was great also. The French rolls were pretty good. But, everybody's favorite was the carrot raisin, I believe that's what it was. I've also have their chocolate chip banana muffin which is amazing. But, if you're going to have that one, save it for dessert. Because, it is sweet & quite rich. Their corn chowder soup is one of the best that I've ever had. I've never even tried a different soup from them, because I love the corn chowder so much. I am a hot tea drinker, & I love that they bring you your own little teapot. Very cute & convenient at the same time. I ordered the bacon & avocado burger which was delicious as always. And, I really love their fries. They definitely taste like they cut them there. I definitely don't taste as if they were once frozen. Overall, it's a cute & casual place to go to. It's fairly inexpensive I would say. But, still rather delicious.
