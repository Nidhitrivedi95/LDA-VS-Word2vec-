DJcvnN7BCiqOUAra35xYuA Possibly the worst Vietnamese restaurant in town. Service was extremely poor as the servers had no clue how to wait on patrons. 

We waited about 15 minutes just to get water and a single coffee order for the table. A manager had to come over and let the server know that we hadn't yet received any drinks. To make matters worse no one handed us a menu after being seated. Finally when we got menus: All three of us who dined had to repeat our order at least 3 times before the server got our order right. 

The food itself was atrocious. Worst pho I've ever tasted. My sister got a chicken sandwich that wasn't even edible. Literally the chicken tasted rancid. As if you were eating tendon and bone rather than real meat. Thankfully the waitress compensated us for the awful sandwich. 

Would not recommend it. Wouldn't go again. Ownership needs to make improvements ASAP. Cause this place is a catastrophe.
