MdjIl105vqCYUGKFSUVytA Went there with my friend. 

Ordered veal tartare and hamachi for appetizer. 

The veal tartare was 2 out of 10. 
And I'm a big beef tartare fan and have tried it at most established french restaurants in Toronto. 

Hamachi was just ok. 

We both ordered sirloin entrecôte steak. 

Both steaks 3 out of 10 and I'm being really generous here since the frite was good. 

She couldn't even finish half her steak. 

Ordered chocolate soufflé for desert which was really good. 

For the price you're paying this place is FAR from impressive. 


3.5 for food. 

9.0 for service 

9.0 for decor. 


As a real estate broker I get to dine at many nice restaurants and I must say I won't be going back to Colette!!!
