4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Right outside the Paris hotel and next to Miracle Mile.
Didn't get much food, but I can tell I already love this place.
Came in for a quick coffee & pastry run before heading to the airport.
Service was nice and fast.
Total line out the door by 10am on a Sunday.
Everyone wants to sit outside but if you're okay with sitting inside, you can get seated faster.

The croissant and muffin were excellent.  Parisian bakery.  Coffee was awesome.  Service was so nice about getting a to-go cup for a coffee refill.  Highly recommend.

Want to come back here for a longer and proper breakfast next time!
