gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA I absolutely love french food. Surprisingly, in a town like Las Vegas, good french food has been hard to find. It feels like each casino tries to do an "upscale European" restaurant and then most defaults to Italian. Other than Bardot at the Aria, Alize is our favorite french restaurant in the city.

Alize does have an amazing view. Unfortunately the Palms is a bit outdated, which is a shame -
 I would imagine Alize would feel more exciting and fancy if it was in a newer building. 

Alize has all the trappings of a great french restaurant. Rich flavors, decadent meat-centric dishes, foie gras, giant cheese cart, and moderate portions that leave you wanting more but leaves you room for rest of the meal. Pages of wine from bordeaux, burgundy, Loire valley, and champagne. And even more pages of wine from outside of those 4 regions.  Impeccable service with a slightly stuffy air - but in a good way. In the way that makes you feel like you should be dressing up to come here instead of wearing a muscle T and cutoff jeans like the rest of the restaurants in vegas.

We plan on returning to try the a lacarte menu. There is much lobster to be had.
