_cjPEH9wXhKS-HQe_U3M4Q French bistros are basically everything that I love: beautiful atmosphere, a bar stocked with French-influenced spirits, good wine by the glass, charcuterie, and simple, unfussy classics so wonderful when well-prepared. Bistros are where I go to relax and wind down, thus, after an eight-hour drive to Toronto, and feeling frustrated by the nearby hotel where we had just checked in, I remembered spying Le Select while driving around the block to park. It was just what we were looking for, and a round of Negronis definitely took the edge off for both my partner and I. We followed that up with a plate of the head-to-tail charcuterie, with the lovely crock of pickles and a glass of wine, and thus fortified, headed off into the city to enjoy our trip. 

We determined to come back once more, because I wanted to indulge in my once-a-decade bite of foie, which they serve with Sauternes -- a wonderful pairing I had never had because so few restaurants have Sauternes. Again a lovely, lovely experience. Only wish we'd had time to have a full meal there.
