4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw This used to be my favorite restaurant locally.  Mostly because of the patio and the view.  The food was always good too. But this time the food was disgusting. The tartare was made with mayo and literally slathered in it.  It was gross. The Pate was hard and dry.  Even the Brie and chicken sandwich was covered in mayo.  The drinks were beyond over priced - even for the strip.  After waiting an hour for patio seating it was barely shaded.  

But, the service was superb!  It's simply not a French inspired restaurant anymore. It's another conglomerate taking tourists money pretending to be something it's not. The only thing it has going for it is the Bellagio fountains. And FYI $13 for valet parking is so ridiculous. Going from $0 to $13 - give me a break.  I cannot believe anyone visits this city. I live here so I'm screwed.
