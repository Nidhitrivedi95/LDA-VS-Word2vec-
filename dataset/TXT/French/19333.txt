aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw If your staying at the Venetian and Palazzo, this is the ultimate for early morning coffee and breakfast treats.  This is made if you need that cure of late night Vegas.  Food choices are vast for a walk up only eatery.  Coffee is decent but nothing special.  Usually visit a few mornings during a Vegas stay.  Their bakery selection is the best.  Try the beignets, either raspberry or cream.  Awesome!!  The croissants are wonderful as well.  You can even get a small Champagne to go, add a fresh squeezed OJ and make Mimosa's in your room.  It's Vegas, it's allowed, it should be allowed anywhere.  Love this place.
