SHARE EVERYTHING.

My favourite dish was the foie gras terrine: it beautifully showcased the lush savouriness for which foie is known, while balancing the fatty richness with a delightfully sweet apple jam peppered with toothsome chunks throughout. 

Everything else was just felt like an exercise in excess.  We should have taken a hint from the table of four hulking men next to us who opted to share the stuffed pig's foot stuffed with foie.  But instead, the waiter shamelessly let both myself, and a dining companion half my size, order one each for ourselves.  The fattiness and crisp skin together delivered a marvelously succulent bite, but once I downed a second forkful, I could already feel my arteries start to wince in pain.

The duck in a can was pleasantly tender and succulent, but with all the elements blended together in this way, it almost felt like the flavours were bordering on monochromatic (although "fatty rich goodness" is not necessarily a flavour I would frown upon).

The confit of lamb shank, however, seemed to impress the most critical of my dining companions, who noted that the moistness was deftly preserved, and the confit embodied a full, intense flavour without being overly gamy.

And the french onion soup?  Just check out Jon H.'s review.  I think he would live and breathe and bathe in this stuff if he could.
