oZHbPhIj01_31jqD053a_Q I and my lovely girlfriend went to Europea for our anniversary. It is a fancy looking restaurant and the decor is elegant. Service is great as well. We ordered the signature tasting menu and a regular tasting menu. All the dishes are well dressed and decorated with beautiful and colorful looking. However, as a high-end restaurant, the taste of their food are definitely not worth the price. I think they spend more time and effort on the emotional experience of the customer instead of the essential element which is the taste of the food. Overall, it is a nice restaurant but over priced. I would go have a great experience with my loved one for once, but definitely not come back again.
