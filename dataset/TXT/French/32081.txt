gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA Ok.  This review is for a visit to Alize a few months ago (right after xmas) so details are not fresh in my mind.  

In general we had a nice experience there.  We ordered the prix fixe with the regular wine pairing (not the sommelier wine pairing.  Left us wondering then who did the pairing for the regular pairing?).  

The view from the window seating was beautiful.
The service was very nice from friendly staff all around to a very attentive waitress.  
Food was yum, and the courses that kept on coming kept us on our toes.  

A side note: two orders of wine pairing was a bit much for us.  I think we could have shared one glass.  

One star off because for how much we paid I'd expect to be knocked off my feet by the experience.  I mean overall was a nice special meal but definitely was too pricey.  

Not complaining all that much tho.  Good job Alize.  haha =]
