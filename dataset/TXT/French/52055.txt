pmoIMK8zGWvKsVOPDBYfzg food is tasty but i can't imagine paying more than 15 dollars of food that they actually put on the plate and i actually paid 75 pp.  considering it is restuarant week, their selctions were faily limited.  portions are small, but if i had to eat 3 bowls of bread in addition to 5 courses paid 75 and afterwards, go out to order salad from another cafe to feel okay full, it is not worth it.
