wwgRu0TAMX8rfRhsiI0ifQ bistro 57 provides EXCELLENT SERVICE, decent food but a poor Happy Hour.  The drinks are slightly reduced bit their new bar food pricing is all wrong. They advertise $5 appetizers bit provide less than half the normal portion.  In other words,  an $8 meatball appetizer which for$8 has two meatballs and fries,  for$5 it is ONE MEATBALL and fries!  All the menu appetizers are more expensive at happy hour,  based on portion,  than regular price.   We really like the place but figured we won't be eating there during happy hour until they make it HAPPY AGAIN.  BTW this all happened due to Boyd gaming taking over the casino.
