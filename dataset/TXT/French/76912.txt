ysJo5Jdo29XOBCnKrbUKWg This is a cute restaurant with seating in back on deck or some inside. The outside view is not great. The inside can be noisy with a relatively open kitchen and people coming in to just buy pastries. I started with the salmon tartare which was excellent and the line sorbert paired perfectly with the salmon (excellent together in a single bite). The bread was freshly cut to serve at the table and the butter was creamy and decadent. This butter with the bread was some of the best that I've had. For main course, I had the mussels Roquefort style. The flavor of the blue cheese persisted in the cream and butter based broth. The mussels were huge and well prepared. The broth was so heavy that I had difficulty finishing the mussels, despite how good they were. We got 6 macaroons to go, which were excellent as well. The violet and lavender were among the best, while the strawberry was nothing special. I thought the salty caramel was the best of those that I tried.  This is a very good French restaurant and I would recommend to foodies that prefer to not have coleslaw and fries on top of all of their dishes.
