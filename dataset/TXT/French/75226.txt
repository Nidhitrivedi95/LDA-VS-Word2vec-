y0cgy0tTh_C8NWCk0WGgjQ We dined here recently on their gorgeous patio (which is nicely shaded for dinner!) and it was good.  Our waiter was very attentive, helpful and polite; he made us feel very welcome.  The food was not as good as our first visit here about 2 years ago (when the food was 5/5 stars).  We ordered the exact same dishes as last time (caesar salads and burgers) but somehow, they were not as good as we remembered them.  The salads had actual giant chunks of the lettuce base in them (which we picked out and put on side plates/it was not mentioned by anyone).  The salads just weren't as "wow" as last time.  The burgers were good but again, not "wow".  Small thing, but weird - the bread basket at the beginning of the meal - had 3 (small) pieces of bread in it.  Exactly one piece per person at our table.  Prices were acceptable but the food could have made the prices a bit more acceptable.  Overall, it was good and fine but not enough for a third visit or a recommendation to friends.  Lastly, there is no children's menu so I ended up just splitting the adult meals onto a plate for our son (who was equally unimpressed with the food overall).  It wouldn't be hard to throw a kid's menu together (even a limited choice of 3 entrees - mini burger, pasta or chicken fingers - you can't go wrong) given the demographics* of the neighbourhood.  *lots of people with kids within walking distance looking for a decent place to eat!
