eJ9L40jm5VOXCIq7xs9kQw This place deserves 3.5 stars (and since my sig other is reading over my shoulder and he wants to give it 4, I'm giving it 4).  I want to give it 3 because after having dinner the night before at Europea, I was less impressed with this place.  

We were here for NYE 2011.  There was a 7-course prix-fixe menu for $96.  The atmosphere was a bit stuffy and the service a bit slow (they were clearly overwhelmed- the entire restaurant was packed at 9:30pm when we came in for our reservation).  The 7 courses started out fantastic and sort of declined as the night went on.  They could've gotten away with serving us about 1/2 to 3/4 of the amount of food per plate than they did.  The 4-6 oz. of veal for the 6th course was just too much (and reminded me of very fancy wedding food- you know that kind that comes out with basic sides and feels like it's been in the oven/warmer waiting for you?).  They did give us all glasses of bubbly to greet the new year and the warmth from all the staff was really lovely.  I may go here again for a small dinner, but I will survey the other Montreal eateries first.  

It was a comfortable and delicious was to ring in the new year, I just wasn't overly impressed.
