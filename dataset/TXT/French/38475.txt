JJ1Ruu37kn66YSWUmCKNCw My friend and I were here, looking for mussels and fries close to the Fine Arts Museum. Conveniently, we went on a Sunday and they run a special Sunday-Wednesday on mussels and fries for, I believe, ~$14. We were greeted by the pleasant staff who let us know it's BYOB, and pointed us in the right direction towards a nearby liquor store.
My friend order the Italian while I ordered the Mariniere. I'd give the food 3 stars, good but not particularly exceptional. 

I wish I was able to give this restaurant 3.5 stars. However, I decided to round up to a 4 star review, rather than 3, because of the exceptional service and great deal on the mussels. Our waiter was very pleasant and the food was good considering the price. I'm not sure if I'd return here and pay the normal price of $19 for my entree, but I can imagine coming back if I'm ever in the area and wanted mussels and fries.
