KRgTdfs4oVFUcATMfAoR4A We walked in at 10 til 10pm, starving and desperately wanting French food for our first night in Montreal.  They told us they could take us if we ordered quickly-- I was afraid that the whole meal would be rushed but they ended up telling us to take our time.  They brought out a free tapas plate- sort of a seasoned meatball on top of a chickpea spread-- it was good and helped to tide us over.

For hour devoures we got Crispy Shrimp which had a tasty dipping sauce.  For dinner, I had the pan seared scallops over greens and a cauliflower puree.  The scallops were perfectly cooked-- I was afraid they might be rubbery.  The puree was seasoned very well.  

We skipped the dessert and instead had a round of beers.  

It was an excellent meal and the waitstaff took care of us well.
