XgkTmVrlHHO5g96AfOAfpw We came here and got a table outside on a fine summer evening.  The weather was great and the table right on the street.  Observing the scene downtown, I noticed many people dressed as animals.  Seems it was Furry week in Pittsburgh.  This was cause for a drink.  A round of French Blondes (yes this is a drink) were ordered.  A Delicious grapefruit concoctions with gin.

Next up was the table side cheese.  Now I was concerned that one of these furry creatures may grab one, but the waitress boxed them out successfully.  The cheese was quite good.  Nice selection.  It when well with our bottle of rose.

Dinner was the Salmon En Papillote.  The salmon was moist and medium rare.  Quite good.  The rice was also fine.

We also sampled the seitan vol au vent dish.  The curry flavor was amazing.  I preferred this to the salmon.

As for sides, the truffle fries are tops.

Overall a quality meal while watching the furries.  It was so good, we ate it all.  No table scraps for the furries.
