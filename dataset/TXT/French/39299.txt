jSfnItqaOnEp2nenVF7fCg LIkely the only reason I do not give this little gem five stars is the strip mall ambience of the place. The food is fresh, delicious, and wonderfully presented. Have not tried dinner...at bit pricey for me, but breakfast and lunch menus are small and delightful. They are very helpful if you are taking an older person who has rather picky taste (just eggs and english muffin please). Their crepes are to die for, all the soups have been rich and creamy, the bread tastes home baked. If you want New Orleans style pastry..Sunday is your day. We are now regulars.
