uB6gdgo8pL4baMgdc4vS3A I love the Crown Bamboo bath sheets - think ultimately absorbent and light. I had to google and order some for home. The goat milk's moisturizer  and bath soap are wonderful. Room  is squeaky  clean. Waffle knit bath robes are lovely. Bed and pillows comfy. Balcony inviting and weather happened to be cooperating with rays of sunshine and some warmth.  Underground parking for a small fee (in Montreal, seriously? How great is not having to circle around trying to find parking and worrying about break ins?).  Service overall friendly and attentive. Lovely breakfast (don't miss the mini croissants).

Some minor opportunities. List ordering information for goat milk products and towels. : ) 

Crank up the strength of your breakfast coffee. Instruction on how to swipe your card on getting into room (top/down, fast/slow etc). Provide a list of TV channels and languages.  Provide some more cups for the coffee machine (and milk packs in refrigerator) . How about a bottle opener in the room? 

Overall, I am a raving fan and will return.
