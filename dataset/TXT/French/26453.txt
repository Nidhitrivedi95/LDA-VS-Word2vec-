D7CnTsm8SCmbQghz1ioPdw I have eaten here on numerous occasions and have never had a bad experience. Both table and bar service have been exceptional with knowledge of the menu and great recommendations. I have had virtually everything on the menu and love the the tartars featured as starters as well as the rabbit or the trout for entrees. Atmosphere is unique and they always have great music playing. Strongly recommended for visitors and locals alike in the neighborhood.

Adding to my review as I returned this evening with a large group...the ownership at L'Orignal were more than accommodating despite our larger than anticipated party. Service was on point and the food was fantastic. Thank you guys again for a great night!
