ME6D5nLlfG0xZCtICOYDuw Yeap, I'm a fan. The first time I went to Georges Brasserie was for my birthday about four months after I came to Charlotte. I had already been to a couple of nice restaurants in center city but this place blew the competition out of the water with its great atmosphere and friendly service. Most importantly, yes, the food is great.

So for the price range I'd say it's the place to go for that romantic date, have a good time with friends, or even take your family/in-laws to have a good time. All worked for me.
