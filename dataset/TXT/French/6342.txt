4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Recently I went through a few old boxes in preparation for my upcoming move towards the northern region. I stumbled upon an old 2002 Sprint PDA I had, that was way ahead of it's time. It took video. On this phone and a few other phones, I found amazing footage of this special restaurant, and the very special night it holds dear to my heart. 
Mon Ami Gabbi was the restaurant my fiance and I celebrated our recent engagement in on 11.22.2002. The food was amazing, and as usual, Bear planned the entire thing ahead of time, so that the evening was perfect. 
Sitting on the patio you gain the complete view advantage of the Bellagio Water Fountain show. It's Romance...pure romance... and I'd love to share the video of the restaurant and the view from the patio, right here:

On this special evening in 2002, the night was cooler and the food we ordered was geared toward warming us up a little bit.  He ordered the french onion soup as well as a few main entree's - and let me tell you...I've yet seen a french onion soup so mastered.  Oozing and bubbling with cheese and a rich broth, he was one happy Bear. 

One of the best weeks and memories of my life, was during this time and I wanted to share it with those who might be looking for a romantic place to bring your girl. It's as if you are having a dinner and a show all in one, but without the cost of a show.
