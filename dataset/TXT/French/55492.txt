rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Food here is always really good. Just tad on the expensive side....but I guess this is vegas. What did you expect? 

We waited for about 30mins for our table of 7 on a Saturday at noon so not too bad but I would still recommend reservations. They had Madeleines out for us while we waited which was nice. 

I ordered the madam croque which was super yummy. Latte was what you would expect. Our table also got the poulet et des gaufres (chicken and waffles) which was also yummy.
