4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw We had the seafood crepe and a salmon salad. The seafood crepe was really good. The salmon salad was also good, but I felt like I overpaid for something so ordinary. Of course you pay a little extra for the environment (popular place on the strip with patio seating). I would go again. Tip: the line is usually long for patio seating. We had no line for dining inside. There are two different lines.
