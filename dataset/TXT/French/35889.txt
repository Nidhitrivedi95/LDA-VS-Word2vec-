Fresh ingredients-had the lobster roll and jerk crab legs. Everything cooked perfectly. Definitely paying for quality rather than quantity.

Lobster was tender and flavorful and just melted in my mouth--not overdone with the mayo. The bread was enough to contain the mélange of sweet crustacean.  The spices in the jerk crab legs were an explosion of flavor --finger lickin' good!

Hip meets rustic, very dim lighting so it was a bit hard to see my food, but 'twas ok once my eyes adjusted. Music was a bit on the louder side but since my table was wedged pretty close to other tables it helped cut through any awkwardness of hearing  other conversations!

Attentive and friendly!  Actually didn't have a reservation but the host   was able to give me a table as long as I left before the next reservation (which was an hour and 15 minutes later). Since I had traveled 4600 km from Cali, I'll take any opportunity I can get!
