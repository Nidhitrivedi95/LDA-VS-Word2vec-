L6RxkP8dneVGelDLUhjCug The pictures posted on the Yelp app give a very nice view of this new 'fusion' bakery; the macaroons and bakery items seem to be the main focus as the menu is limited for sandwiches and noodle dishes. 

Grace and I visited around 4pm on a Monday evening, had the place to ourselves as half a dozen other visitors stopped in to pick up macaroons/pastries. Food is good but nothing exceptional. Bakery items are very good!

We ordered pho with rare beef, spring rolls, and a Vietnamese sandwich (get two for the price of one!) Bahn Mi Cha Pate and a Thai tea. 
I really enjoy a good Thai tea but not a fan of boba or pre-made Thai teas..this Thai tea was probably a mix. The sandwiches, spring roll and pho were good but would have appreciated having the spring rolls cut in halves; the peanut dip for the rolls was without peanuts.

Overall, a positive experience.
