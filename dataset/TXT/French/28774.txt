Tourists from countries that lack the French charm that Montreal has to offer are so starry-eyed by the restaurants near the old port that pretty much every restaurant gets a five-star (I'm sure the wine, and the fact that one is on vacation also add to the feel-good all around). 

Montrealers, on the other hand, are used to good food, and consider anything that doesn't match up to the high standards not worth it, especially if you're spending a fortune for your food. In this regard, we really didn't think that Bonaparte deserves more than one star. The food was average, our server kept forgetting our request for a wine list, and for menus, and was, on the whole, most unhelpful (although profoundly apologetic for her clumsiness). The ambience is good, but if your looking for a delicious French meal, there are many better options in the city (Try Entrepont, an exponentially better experience, or Le P'tit Plateau, or Toroli if you like to try fusion French food).

Overall, not worth the price at all.
