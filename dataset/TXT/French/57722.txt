rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Incredible dinner.  I could eat here every day, but the butter would eventually kill me.

We started out with mussels, frites, and escargot.  You can't go wrong with mussels and frites... but I have to admit that I like new Zealand mussels over the new England ones.  Sacrilege,  I know.  The escargot was amazing.  Each one had a mini puff pastry on top.  Between the escargot and the puff pastry, it was like double the butter and garlic soaking ability.  Pure genius.  It didn't stop us from slipping up the remaining butter and garlic with the fresh baguette.

For my main course, I had the leg of lamb by recommendation of our server.  Probably one of the best lamb dishes I've had.  The fava beans and turnips went well.  Nice rich lamb taste, not over powering.  I think the only better lamb I've had came off of a spit in Piraeus.

Then, for dessert, we started with the Teahive cheese, again by recommendation.  It was a tea infused cheddar, served with a honeycomb, slices of apple, and some raisin bread.  The four flavors went so nicely together, and it was the perfect transition to our main dessert... brownies with peanut butter ice cream.  I have to say that it was the PB best ice cream ever.  Like a cold, creamy serving of hand made peanut butter.  

Like I said, I could eat here for the rest of my life.  It was so rich though, I'd probably die of obesity and a heart attack sooner than later.

Oh, I highly recommend Bouchon.
