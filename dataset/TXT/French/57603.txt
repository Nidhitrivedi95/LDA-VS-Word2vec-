rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A When I found out I was going to Vegas for a conference, the first thing I told my travel buddy was "We have to go to Bouchon!" 

As usual, I was not disappointed. We shared beignets and I had the brioche french toast, both of which were incredible. My friend is a pescetarian and the waiter and kitchen were amazingly accommodating with serving her an a la carte breakfast. The coffee was fantastic, and the service was even better. 

Always, always recommended.
