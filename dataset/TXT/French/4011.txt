2B46bRpDh49eDyjXGhL_ZQ Yummy crepes! We had the ham and cheese crepe and a strawberry and whipped cream crepe, both were amazing and tasted very authentic. The coffee was good as well. Maggie the owner and her assistant Leticia were very friendly and welcoming. There isn't much ambiance, but the crepes make up for it!
