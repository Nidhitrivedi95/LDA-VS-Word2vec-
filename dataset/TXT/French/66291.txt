But even I was struck by the quality of the food. My girlfriend and I shared the Mac n Cheese and the Pork Belly, and both were absolutely delicious. Service was excellent, minimal wait times, and the food arrived promptly. This place should definitely be at the top of your list when you're dining out in Montreal.
