2gUbgbdJ7IFSbicBXlSchw I loved this place. It was the first time I had ever gone. The food was spectacular, the staff were wonderful and the ambiance was quaint. It was perfect.
Our waiter was extremely helpful with helping us choose the perfect win to pair with our dishes. I had the rillettes as an entrée (out of this world great!!!) and the grilled salmon on a bed of spinach as my main (Holy mother of pearl.. I still dream about it).. And because I'm a pig, I decided to try the dessert that they are "known" for; the Floating Island Dessert. It was so great that my boyfriend said (and I quote) "I should get one of these for home if it keeps you so quiet"...

A MUST TRY!
