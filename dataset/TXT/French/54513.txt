rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw Where do I start?! Came here for Brunch, best decision of my trip to Vegas. So, not only can you get bottomless rose or sparkling rose, the food was off the charts good.  I chose the still offering, what a great deal...definitely got my money's worth!  Reminded me of a quaint brasserie in Paris. This place is legit. The only issue we had was deciding what to order!  We ended up sharing the beef Bourgogne croissant Benedict and the French toast. I can say that hands down the best French toast I've ever had. It was unbelievable. The Benedict was awesome too. Service was perfect, and attentive. Please go here. Michael Mina is amazing.
