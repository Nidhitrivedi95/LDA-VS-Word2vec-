MdjIl105vqCYUGKFSUVytA This place was amazing. I went there for lunch during the weekday in March 2015. The staff was just phenomenal, very friendly, yet professional.

I got the l'hamburger and it was delicious. The fries and sauce that came with it were equally as good. The service was quick and the staff was very aware and helpful. 

I will definitely be back.
