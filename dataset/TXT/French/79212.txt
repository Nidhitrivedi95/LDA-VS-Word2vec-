ZdaZwXC0FByDY3EwNELphw Since we live just down the street, we're at Union often. Maybe to the point where they think we're crazy, but it's such a lovely spot to end off the week...and have Sunday brunch! 

The atmosphere is cozy and unpretentious. The servers are beyond kind and appear to truly love working at the restaurant. Drinks are always on point and I have yet to have a dish that I wouldn't order again. I love that they make an effort to constantly offer new items on the menu whilst keeping the classics. Peach and tomato seasons are my fave as it means you get a beautiful dish of fresh fruit with buffala cheese and olive oil. Maybe also a piece of toasty garlic bread too if you're lucky. 

A true gem of a restaurant in Toronto.
