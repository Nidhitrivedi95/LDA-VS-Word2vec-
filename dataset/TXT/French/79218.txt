ZdaZwXC0FByDY3EwNELphw I recently went to Union for Sunday brunch. I had been to Union many years ago for drinks but had not tried the brunch until now. Located near Ossington and Argyle, Union is a bustling French restaurant serving local farm-to-table fare. 

My boyfriend and I arrived for brunch at around 11:30am and the restaurant was slowly seating everyone at staggering times. Smart idea knowing that they did not want to compromise the quality of the service and overwhelm the kitchen. We opted to sit at the chef's table which was facing all the action in the open kitchen (loved it!). We ordered our drinks and got them promptly. For food, my boyfriend ordered the Swiss Train Ride (with Paris ham, Swiss cheese, fried egg, bechamel, and rosti) and I ordered the chorizo scramble (with garlic scapes, blue cheese, and chili jam).  Both dishes were delicious. I'm not a huge fan of blue cheese to begin with but the combinations of flavours just worked. Moreover, the quality of the ingredients spoke in each dish as you could taste how fresh everything was. 

Overall, the food came out a bit slow but Union provides a great relaxing environment to have brunch. The vibe and service is friendly and attentive and the food is delicious. Union has definitely become one of my favourite brunch spots after this visit!
