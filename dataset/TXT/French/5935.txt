3rj1qpgFvkRWtAka17mhEQ As regular customers we had an off experience we thought we would share. Entered the restaurant at 8pm on a Friday night and was greeted and seated right away, the hostess was great. Once we sat down, not one person acknowledged us for over 10 minutes. Multiple servers, employees, and a manager walked past us without saying a word and a couple even made eye contact with me.  Our menus were closed, tables near us were being cleaned and we were just overlooked. After 12 minutes we got up and left the restaurant and then I went back into share with an employee to let them know, not to get anybody in trouble, but to just let them know we were disappointed and to hopefully help them fix the process. 

When I went back inside once again I was greeted quickly at the door and I shared my experience.  The server who talked to me was polite,  apologetic, and offered free muffins.  I didn't want muffins, just wanted to let them know about the situation, so I denied them from the employee. 

We will return in hopes of better service in the future, I mean I really do like their muffins.
