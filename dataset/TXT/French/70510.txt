xaqW4NkmUCGRRjmLxiFJ6Q Very cool idea of having crepes of lunch, breakfast and desert. They have excellent customer service and very nice people.
All their crepes are rly good. They also have this sugarcane juice that they make from fresh sugarcanes, it seems not ad interesting but its realllyyyyy good!
