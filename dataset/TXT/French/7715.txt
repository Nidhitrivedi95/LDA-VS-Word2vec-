Expensive drinks that tasted like a peach gummy? Check.

Air conditioning so cold I had to borrow my man's jacket? Check.

A nice place open past 10pm when we really needed that? Check.

I had a blast here. Our one night in Vegas we decided to make awesome in terms of food and drink. I had a tomato salad that tasted so lemony, it blew my mind. I suspect the olive oil on it was lemon infused. It was like crack. My scallops were also good, and my bf had a huge half a chicken that we couldn't get close to finishing.

For dessert we shared a creme brulee, which was also yummy. This place and our fabulous hotel room upgrade really makes me want to go back to Vegas, and I didn't think that would happen, at all. :)
