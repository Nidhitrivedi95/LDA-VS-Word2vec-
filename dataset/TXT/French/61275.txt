SJo_IjvzdRtCvZVN0cbrRQ This use to be a great restaurant that was slightly pricey but worth it. It's been a couple of months since we've been here. We walked in for brunch today, the menu has been condensed and the prices have gone up even more. It was $15 for eggs, bacon and potatoes. That was the cheapest thing in the menu. So with drinks, entrees and tip you'd be out $50 dollars for a simple brunch. This is a small town and not Manhattan. They need to reevaluate their status in the restaurant world.
