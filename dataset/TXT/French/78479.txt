Z47kPgBvVit8HtyyDiw59g We started with the smoked salmon, which was paper thin and obviously made in house. We devoured it! The pate was a generous portion, light, almost fluffy, and out of this world. The duck confit was amazing, tender, moist, delicious. My wife got the cod, which she loved. The creme brulee was heavenly, light vanilla flavor, crispy top with caramelized bits. The kids split the steak frites, and the nine year old told the chef "This is the best meal I have ever had!" which earned two thumbs up for the chef! The service was personal, and top notch. It isn't cheap, but it is worth every penny.
