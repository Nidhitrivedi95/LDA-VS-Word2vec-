Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA Amazing view, possibly one of the best in Vegas from the 64th floor of THE HOTEL.  Great food, great service, in a dramatic room with modern lighting, furnishings and floor to ceiling glass. The waiters were going all out to earn their tips and everyone left happy, full and delighted. Frankly one the better experiences I've had in a "high end" Vegas eatery in YEARS! Menu has a wide variety from mild to wild. Standouts included lobster ceaser, tuna tar-tar, foie-gras, chicken surf and turf with stuffed chicken breast and crabmeat...  After, or before, spend some time in the amazing bar that is attached with the same outstanding strip views. AAA wine list and good strong cocktails. Worth the wait and every penny, I'll go back. figure $75-100 per person + drinks. 

One small gripe - we made a reservation - they did not have it when we got there - they seated us the lounge, we had a drink and they gave us a great table w/in ten minutes, so -  no harm no foul. Also, the chairs are weird. Small and high design, but too low, so that I, at only 6ft tall, felt like I was squatting, legs kind of tucked under me, they should allow full leg extension but don't so I'll assume a small Asian or Itallian guy picked them.
