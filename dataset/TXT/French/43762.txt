m9aFZk1f8tSv248YErbpQA Went for crepes and discovered the salad. The staff was nice, friendly, and quick to take my order. I got one of the savory crepes and one dessert crepe. The savory crepe was surprisingly better than the dessert crepe. I am a bit disappointed since I was hoping the dessert crepe would be the best part. Both crepes weren't anything to crave. The best part of the crepes was the side salad that came with the savory crepe. The house dressing made the entire salad. I will be back to try a salad next time.
