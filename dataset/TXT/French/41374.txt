kGOr_D-LNpgZ2M9N8TT4QQ This place has so much potential, it is such a shame that the service seems completely clueless. I went on weeknight for drinks and a bite, the person seating us was confused about which tables were free and just told us to find space at the bar. When we sat at the bar, servers kept brushing past us not bothering to apologize. This did mean we got to see the food going out, did not look appetizing at all. The only person who seemed to care about customers was the bartender. We decided just to have a cocktail and leave to get food somewhere else. 

I had expected more based on having been to the LS in Montreal, which is miles better.
