Got my yummy mimosa (in a large wine glass!) quickly ! The entrée came in under 10 minutes, was hot and the poached eggs were perfect! I ordered Potatoe Cake Eggs Benedict and it was delicious! Can't quite finish it :-) Got a second mimosa(not in the larger wine glass that I like though) and am trying to supress my excited satisfaction.....the mimosas were 'brunch price' - ($5.00 on weekends) a great experience, I will be back! .....now to go home and have a nap.
