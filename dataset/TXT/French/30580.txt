fVF5wayDyY6ZR5oJB1IK3g We went to Lawrence for brunch and it was great. The tea was lovely, and the doughnuts were wonderful. I also had the gammon steak with egg and it was delicious. I really liked the vibe - it was clean and modern without being annoyingly trendy. The waiters were friendly and efficient and I would return on my next trip to Montreal.
