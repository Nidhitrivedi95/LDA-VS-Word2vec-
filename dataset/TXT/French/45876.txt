mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q A really enjoyable evening. We sat at the bar and ending up sharing some of the plates with the couple next to us who were friends with Joel and getting the royal treatment.

  It was my first time trying Iberico ham. When I asked the waiter if it was like prosciutto, he said yes except on steroids and he was right. 

 Out of everything I ordered, the only thing that did not knock me out was the cheese course. It was only $14 (maybe per person), so no big deal.

  Also, we had been drinking Schramsberg earlier in the evening and decided to continue with that and they were out. It was only $70, a steal (on their wine list) and we ended up with something else that was $250. Send someone to BevMo guys. 
 
 Will be back.
