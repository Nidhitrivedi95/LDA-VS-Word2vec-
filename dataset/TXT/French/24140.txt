cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg Yeah,  the cuisine  is really good  but  I sort of got disappointed  because  there is just too much  hype  about this place  so unless  you  are stepping in Montreal's  best  restaurant,  you are sort of  guaranteed  to be disappointed.  Same  happened  to me because  I was expecting  the best  there is but got simply  a good restaurant.  The staff  was great though.
