4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Been here a few times over the years. Good choice if you're not in the mood for buffets.  We sat in the covered patio which offers a view of the strip without having to sit on the patio. We got the steak which was moist & tender. And escargots & bread is pretty good. Food & service is good, just A little pricey, dinner for 2 with drinks just under $100.
