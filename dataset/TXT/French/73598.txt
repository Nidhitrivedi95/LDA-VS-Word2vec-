xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g Everything was cooked as they should be, with some dishes being outstanding and others being ok.  The filet mignon was superb.  The salmon was about right - not outstanding, but salmon very rarely is.  Short-ribs were somewhere between good and great (lacked that extra oomph to blow my mind).  The chocolate mousse and ice cream dessert (cannot remember what it was actually called) was outstanding.  Side dishes varied from average (creamed spinach) to perfect (green beans almondine).

They also had a Cote de Nuits Pinot by the glass (+1), which I was very excited about. Fantastic wait staff too.

However, -1 because when we first went in, the host staff tried to put us in the very back of the restaurant looking out into an alley or something; I didn't bother to look long enough to figure it out, but quite frankly that back corner should not even be a part of the dining room in a restaurant of this caliber.  Normally this wouldn't be an issue worth writing about (I understand a restaurant being busy), except there were numerous empty tables in the main dining area.  I don't know why we were shown a clearly inferior table first and were only seated in the main area when we declined and prepared to leave. I chalked it up to miscommunication among the staff or something like that.

So, it was expensive ($100/pp for us) but I left pretty content.
