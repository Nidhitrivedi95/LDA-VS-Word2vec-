XcWlBj5oQgzKhR7Cxovj3w I would like to preface this review by stating I understand airport locations are never as good as their original. With that said, the Zinc airport location appears to strive for a lower bar then most. It started with the greeting, we walked up and hostess greeted us with a "you're going to have to wait a minute."  No hello or welcome, just instructions to wait (not to mention the fact the restaurant was half empty). We figured, this is what comes with an airport location so no big deal but the greeting really set the tone for our terrible experience. The service level was consistently bad, highlighted by two exceptionally awful events. The first was when our food was dropped off.  It was literally dropped off. No opportunity to ask for anything else or anything. As soon as we had our food, we realized we needed a knife, but our waitress took off and was not to be found. We asked another waitress who said said she would get one. She didn't. Finally, our waitress came back and upon request, she promptly went to a dirty table next to us to get us knives. Disgusting. By this time we had realized our fries were cold which leads me to the second terrible event...

We asked the waitress for new fries, which she was quick to agree to. After about 15 minutes, a reminder that we were still waiting for our fries, and watching the manager yell at another waitress right in front of is, we finally got our fries. The fries redo literally took longer then our food originally took. Look, the point of the airport locations is to provide a good introduction to local restaurants for travelers, but the Zjnc location is doing the opposite. I have wanted to try the Scottsdale location for years, but after my experience at the airport I'm not sure I ever want to go back. The food was pretty good (albeit cold), but the service was so bad I don't have any desire to try a Zinc product at this point.
