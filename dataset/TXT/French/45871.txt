mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q After dining at L'atelier in Paris and New York, the Las Vegas location did not disappoint. The familiar decor and counter top seating creates a vibe of fine dining but more casual than its sister restaurant next door. 
Three out of the four of us have dined at L'atelier before so we wanted our guest to enjoy the full experience. As soon as we were told that there were no Langoustine available, I almost cried. This is like no other Langoustine I've ever had. Wrapped in the lightest phyllo and basil, lightly fried to perfection. The manager was very sympathetic to this and magically the kitchen found 4 langoustine. 
The highlight of dining at L'atelier is the whipped potato. The ratio of cream and butter to potato must be 4 to 1. Pure heaven! 
The service is exceptional and I appreciate how accommodating they are.
