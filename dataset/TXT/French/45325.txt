mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q Ate here, and luckily I didn't pay for it (I would however if I was rich)

The cucumber gelee confused my group, i'd say 3/4ths refused to finish it.  Me and a couple of guys however, gave it a chance, and it grows on you, or atleast gives you a taste you've never experienced before.

I've heard good things about the bread, but was alittle disappointed.  The prosciutto was dry and very good. The quality was very good, but lets be realistic, its just sliced prosciutto, with nothing done, nothing fancy.

Now to the real meat and potatoes, the 9 dollars an ounce steak.  Was it worth it?  Hells yes, cause 1.  I didn't pay for it.  2.  It was worth every bite even if I did.

The steak was cooked to perfection, and very minimally seasoned (or so i think).  That just shows how well it was cooked.  I devoured it.  DEVOURED IT.  Ate the fat, meat, everything.  Every seasoning and oil put on the steak only enhanced its flavor, not masking one bit of the steak like alot of other places do.  The ribeye was the centerpiece and focus of the flavor.  None of the seasonings overpowered it.

The pomme puree was silky smooth.  So much so, it confused alot of us (alot of us aren't fine diners).  Had the consistancy of yogurt, and a ton of butter in it.  Very tasty.

My mouth waters just thinking about it.

Only regrets?   That I got a 12oz steak instead of 20.

Btw, their bathroom has the best paper towels I have ever used.
