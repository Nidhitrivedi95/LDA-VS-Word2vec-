JxtwVeuCBX99KEciymlYXA loved it.  fit for foodies! didn't strike me as country french.  It's more refined.  We had octopus brochette, a meat tartare and a salmon tartare, veal brochette and magret of goose (and a leg) for two that was beautifully presented and perfectly executed.  There was a good selection of nightly specials.  Perfect service.  Right on the Old Montreal waterfront and steps away from vibrant St Paul street. Modern decor, whimsical soft lighting over the bar, romantic.
