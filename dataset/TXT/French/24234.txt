cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg When I found out I was going to Montreal I had to check with my fellow yelpers to find a nice place for dinner. De Cochon came highly recommended not only from yelpers but also the locals. We had reservations for a Wednesday evening and had I had known they have a counter I would have requested that as I love watching the fast paced action of a high end kitchen. We were seated by the door which was definitely not the best spot in the house and having a reservation for over two weeks in advance I would have thought we would have had better seating arrangements. The wait staff was very professional the waiter took time to explain the very interesting menu and assisted us in picking a nice french Pinot Noir. We started with what the locals said was one of the chefs best dishes, the pomme frites cooked in duck fat with curds and gravy topped with foie gras. It was delicious to say the least. The GF had the roasted pork and I opted for the Bison Ribs. Both were excellent choices the pork was tender and juicy and the Bison Ribs were coated in a wonderful sauce that had a slight ginger flavor to it.  We finished with the house specialty for dessert which is a small cake surrounded by local maple syrup MMM, MMM, MMM! It was very interesting almost like having delicious pancakes smothered in maple syrup.  It left us both with wonderful smiles on our faces.

Other than the poor seating we had the meal and service were very good and I would highly recommend it to anyone heading to Montreal!
