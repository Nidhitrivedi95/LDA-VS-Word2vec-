rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A In simple terms...RE-DONK-ULOUS!  Perhaps maybe not simple but I think it's clear.  This is not my first rodeo at Bouchon and certainly not my last.  They continually set the bar for great service, food and wine selection across the board making my experience, along with my girlfriends, less Vegas and more memorable.  From the Carrot Soup Special to a perfect Creme Brulee, the service was perfectly executed down to the last bite.  The decor is beautiful that Parisians would be proud & the music volume and selection was subtle yet present.  Definitely worth going all in!!!
