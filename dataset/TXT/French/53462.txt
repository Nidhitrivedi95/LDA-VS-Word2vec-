QlSpPzc4Oy05ic-PsoYH4g I've wanted try this place for awhile. It's in the mix of so many cool things to do in the South Side. I popped in and it's ordered takeout. The menu is fairly eclectic and focused on mostly small plates, fresh soup (new type daily), and sandwiches that serve as entrees. I ordered two small plates - pork spring rolls (think shredded pork, aioli, and vegetables) and jerk chicken skewers with coconut rice. The spring rolls were excellent and very big. Honestly it's way more filling than one would expect. The jerk chicken was surprisingly good as well. Good level of spice (about a 3 on a scale of 5), very tender, however less filling than the spring rolls. The coconut rice was less impressive. It was mushy and didn't really stand out. Then again, I'm not much of a coconut rice fan anyway. I would definitely return. I imagine the ambiance, particularly during a happy hour or weekend night is probably pretty cool.
