4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I've been here twice and I love everything about this restaurant! I went with my fiancé and friends for New Year's Day and Labor Day Weekend. We were seated in 15 minutes and we sat at the patio section of the restaurant. The service at this place is excellent! They refill waters without asking and the waiters always check on us to make sure everything is okay. My favorite is the eggs benedict and the eggs are poached perfectly! We usually eat here for brunch because we like to sit outside and stare at the Bellagio hotel with the water show and I like to people watch too so that's a plus! 

Overall, I would go back here because the food, view and service are superb!
