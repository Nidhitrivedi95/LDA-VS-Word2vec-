1idRJwqXxxmgSyQRKag4KQ I had heard about this restaurant from some friends and wanted to try it for a while, couldn't find a time that worked until this week. Decided to go try it by myself. They don't have a tasting menu, but when I asked about one, they said they could ask the chef to pick plates for me if I'd like. I was happy to not have to decide because everything on the menu looked great. I ended up tasting 5 things in total: tartare, foie gras, duck, lamb, and souffle. The food was great; I had to wait a little bit for the souffle and it was much bigger than I thought it would be. But overall, it was still good. The service (from Chantal) was fantastic! The cost was reasonable. 

I would definitely come here again. And I *may* try some other stuff, but it might be hard because what I had was so good that I might just do the same thing all over again =)
