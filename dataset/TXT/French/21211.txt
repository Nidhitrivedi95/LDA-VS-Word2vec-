The menu was not the same menu I had looked at on-line (I went back and saw that the spring menu is still on-line, although it is now September), so I was a little disappointed in that as I had chosen the restaurant based on the menu. Nothing on the current menu appealed to me that much. I got the duck with faro. It was very salty. It was just so-so, nothing memorable. My husband got the steak and fries, which was somewhat tough and also very salty.  They were out of the dessert we wanted. It was our anniversary, which I told them when we made the reservation. The only thing they did for that was that we got a "happy anniversary" from the hostess as we left. We went a few blocks away to another french restaurant and had dessert and coffee there on the patio. They brought a sparkler out with dessert in honor of the celebration, which was a nice touch.
