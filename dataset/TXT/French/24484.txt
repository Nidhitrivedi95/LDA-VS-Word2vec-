cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg I don't know how I'm just now rating this place but it's one of the best restaurants I've ever been to. My fiancé and I came here on our last night in Montreal on vacation. Everything we ate was incredible but the star was the foie gras nigiri - an appetizer I would usually not order but it was incredible. The service was amazing, the bathroom is even cool... just go here.
