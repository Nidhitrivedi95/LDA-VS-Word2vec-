SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA Although the menu is quite interesting, the food is WAY over-salted. We have eaten there twice and both times ourfood arrived so over-salted as to be almost inedible. Our party consisted of a young man in his 20's and we are about 60 and we all agreed.  I wish the chefs would salt less and let customers add it to their own taste. The waiter was very nice.
