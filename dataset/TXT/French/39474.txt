jT-KFrbwr5iE-_vrVLpmiw Awesome café, amazing desserts, very high quality. My friend ordered the Fleur de Cao, and I had the Irish cream gelato with a cappuccino. Everything was beyond expectation. Very modern and sleek interior, and large patio for warmer seasons.Highly recommended and worth the drive out of the city.
