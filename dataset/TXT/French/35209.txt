Ht-_i0UAq7YDBaqJwcQMdQ Lovely restaurant for a nice quiet meal among friends or family. Portion sizes are just perfect for a three course meal. I would highly recommend trying the risotto with foie gras shavings (a classic), the frito misto (seasonal appetizer) or the grilled octopus. The hamachi tartare was milder tasting than the other appetizers I tried and did not stand out as much. I wish I had the chance to try the scallops as it is also a classic that's been on the menu since day 1. 

For the main course, the duck magret is done to perfection, but it does have a bit of a gamier taste that took a few bites to get used to. My partner's suckling pig was so good I wish I had switched plates with him. 

As for desserts, the maple parfait was indulgingly sweet. Our entire party thought that the desserts were all too sweet for our palate, but I think that's just personal preference. 

Overall,we had a very pleasant and satisfying meal. It cost about $60-70 per person before taxes and tips, without drinks. If you are ready to splurge, the quality of food and the service that comes along with it will not disappoint you.
