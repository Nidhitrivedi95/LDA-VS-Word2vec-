B5B0G6Yy_LDymFH7_ZNvyA My Dad is nothing short of obsessed with France, and for years whenever he has visited he has wanted to go to Petit Paris. However, foolishly, I did the shallow 'judging a restaurant by its table cloths' thing and always took him somewhere else.

Last night, I finally went here with Joe A, and oh how wrong to judge was I! I wanted to try all the starters, in particular the snails. On this occasion I wasn't very hungry so I just had a main, but I did try some of Joe's black pudding starter and it was delicious! 

For my main I had the veggie option, a goats cheese, red pepper, courgette and tomato pie. It was served in the dish it was cooked in and was really tasty. I also tried a bit of Joe's lamb stew and that was incredibly tender and tasty too.

The staff are all French which is nice, although the language carrier was a slight issue when asking for Jack Daniels, but of course you should just drink wine in a French restaurant anyway :) The décor inside is actually pretty cool, a relaxed atmosphere with old tin adverts on the walls.

So, next time my Dad visits I will absolutely swallow my pride, tell him he was right and I was wrong, and take him here! Oh and I will make sure I'm hungry so I can have the snails!!!
