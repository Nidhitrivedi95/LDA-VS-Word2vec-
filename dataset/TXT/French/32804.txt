h_ypoQ2rmwX8UGSmohsGiQ Tried the Lavender Hot chocolate. It was okay. No overwhelming Lavender taste. The ambience is cute. And oh.......they do not do brunch anymore.

I had the Cappucino and the Blueberry bread. Both are expensive but the Blueberry loaf was really flavourful.  I tasted the Pistachio as well. I prefer the Blueberry.
