LUd3UdlUvCr54H-7ttm0TQ Review from 2013: A Montreal MUST.. Try this tiny place out before it gets too popular and everyone finds out about it, you won't be disappointed. I have only been once so far but will be going back regularly. Menu changes every weekend (see their website on Fridays). We had a few choices for brunch but decided to take the shared menu, where you pay 25$ to get a taste of everything... So worth it! The Cake de crevettes with hollandaise sauce and an egg was delicious, although I can't really recommend a plate due to the changing menu.

Service was also great. Our waiter came to sit with us to explain the whole menu in detail and answer all of our questions. Overall great experience and will be going back soon.
