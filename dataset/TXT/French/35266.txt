Ht-_i0UAq7YDBaqJwcQMdQ An interesting place.  Formal dining in a less than formal environment--which included tourists (like us) in more casual attire.  We were tired from a day of wonderful visits---museums, cathedrals, etc, and were in no mood for a noisy meal at one of the crowded bistros on Rue St. Paul.  We looked in vain for something more subdued.  Finally found Chasse Et Peche almost hidden from sight on Rue St. Claude.  Cool and quiet--refuge from the crowds. 

We ordered, we waited.  And we were rewarded with very good entrees and shared a desert..  My wild boar dish was probably the best meal I had in Montreal--a -substantial portion, yet refined flavors, delicate enough to bing out subtle textures of pasta,and kale and pancetta.. My dining partner had Arctic char, with similar conclusion---very nice preparation in a coconut reduction.  

Not inexpensive--Wine glases start at $10 or so, although we both enjoyed a beer because after hours of walking around the Old City, we were in the mood for something refreshing.   Still, the meal ended up being abut $150 w/tip.  A nice experience, with a very responsive staff.
