YVYHX7RCPjCBqEth2CS91Q This is my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh.  I'm not a French food connoisseur, so I can only judge a French restaurant by things that might make a true connoisseur cringe.  But I consider their French onion soup, their mussels and frites, and their steak and frites.  All of them were solid, and the portions were generous.  The Vol-au-Vent was also amazingly good...the sauce was so good, that we kept asking for bread, just so we could enjoy every last bit of sauce.  Prices are quite good as well.  Now that I think about it, maybe I would give it 4.5 stars.  The service was kinda iffy, and one of the guys made just feel rather uncomfortable, but maybe that's just also authentic French ambiance.
