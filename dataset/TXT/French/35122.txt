HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw First time eating at Comme Ca and was happy to hear that management is tryinig to bring in more locals with their new Wednesday Happy Hour Specials/Dinner. They are trying to make a combination of appetizers, main course (burgers/etc), and cokctail or two beers for $20 dollars. I say not a bad price.

Friend and I went to eat here prior to seeing Empire of the Sun at the Chelsea Theatre. We had made reservations priro to arriving which helped. We were seated outside (great view). We had the Cucumber Sangria, a bit citrusy but delicious. We tried the Lamb Burger which had no game taste due to the seasoning and spices; TOTALLY WOULD ORDER AGAIN. We also had the Pork Burger which I was not too impressed by yet had a good flavor.

I enjoyed the ambience, venue and food for sure and with local specials on Wednesday, why not venture out to the strip!
