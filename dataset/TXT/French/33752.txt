Organic products, freshly baked goods, and great service. I wish I worked in this office complex so that I can come here more often. But alas, I come here only when I wake up early enough on the way to work (actually more like 10 minutes out of the way). 

Just an FYI, the best way to get there, if you are going west on 215, is to exit Buffalo and take Raphael Rivera.
