rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Late to the party on this one, yes, I'm aware. Nevertheless - checking off another one of the "must-try" places on my list!

In contrast to my preconceived notions, I was surprised to find that Bouchon was as warm and unpretentious as it was impeccable in its execution:

__________

We stopped by Bouchon after a typical (i.e. sleepless/drunken) night out on the Strip, and we were very much in need of some hydration & nourishment. The comforting, laid-back atmosphere of the restaurant was exactly what we were looking for - soothing and classically European.

+ Throughout our meal, we found ourselves glancing around the restaurant wondering if we were still in Vegas. 

While many businesses go to lengths to pull off that "oasis from the action" sort of vibe, Bouchon's take on such an aesthetic felt effortless and downright relaxing. The minimal music (although there's lots of ambient conversation), high ceilings, and abundance of natural lighting combine to transport you into what feels like a lovely French estate getaway. The whole setup is about as un-Vegas Strip as possible. 

+ We arrived without reservations on a Sunday morning, but our roughly 20 minute wait breezed by, thanks to a selection of newspapers/magazines to browse through. 

__________

+ The complimentary table bread was the perfect kickstarter for an AM meal. It had a just-right exterior with a balanced crunch, coupled with a moist inside that paired very well with the day's jam selection (I believe it was apricot). This bread was so tasty that I felt compelled to ask for some to take back to the room to snack on later in the day.

+ We knew that our visit would be incomplete without ordering from the Oyster Bar - but being that I'm not a master of mollusks, we decided to go with our server's recommendation in determining what variety of oyster to go with. 

His selections were fantastic - mild and creamy with just a hint of brine. Paired with a spoonful of cocktail sauce and a dollop of horseradish - I could've shoveled those down by the bucketful! 

+ While I consider myself to be a generally adventurous eater, I definitely wasn't showing it during our visit to Bouchon. The Bouchon Burger was admittedly a safe pick on my part - but a heaping fistful of red meat was just what my stomach was craving after a night of drunken debauchery. 

The Burger was executed with an impressive attention to detail; the bun was crisped yet airy, the cheese melted but not runny. Most importantly, the patty was thick, delectably juicy, and cooked to a perfect medium-rare. 

The side of "Animal Sauce" was unashamedly reminiscent of a certain fast food chain that we Californians all know and love - but hey, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery!

The heaping pile of fries plated alongside the burger were a solid accompaniment, though the portion size on these fries could fill two diners with ease. In retrospect, we probably should've split a burger and ordered up some of the menu's other items for the sake of trying different things.

+ Bouchon's commitment to meticulous execution shined through again via a dish as simple as the Sauteed Spinach, which was amazingly fresh and full of vibrant flavor - a great counterbalance to the richness of the thick Burger. 

__________

+ Service was very thorough and consistent; my water was consistently filled, and so too was my coffee. I didn't have to ask for a refill even once! 

The level of service was all the more impressive considering that the restaurant got more and more packed as our meal went on - patrons seemed to pour in without pause, and no table went unfilled for very long. (That's always a good sign!)

Definitely planning a return visit - if not here, than definitely to the Beverly Hills location...!
