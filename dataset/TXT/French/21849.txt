bMiyGPaMqF0svjseW1UR_g All I can think off is... average ! The food is ok but average, clientele, prices are average. The service is very very slow and average again. The choice of wines is poor. In the plate of cheese, it's only American cheeses  (it's supposed to be a French Brasserie).
 
I got the salmon tartare which was too spicy, which hidden all the savors of the fish. My friend got a beef tartare and made the same comment. My other friend got the "Volaille" and told it was very good (and she is picky). Our neighbours got cheeseburgers, and they looked really yummy. The décor is nice.

I won't go back by choice and definitely give my loyalty to Holder or l'Express.
