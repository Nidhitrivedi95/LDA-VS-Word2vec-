The service was exceptional, from the smiling friendly host that seated us to our wonderful attentive waitress Andrea.  The owner even visited our table to chat with us...nice touch.  We sat outside in the courtyard, with French music playing in the background. Andrea immediately came out and took our drink and dinner order. My daughter ordered the Escargot, Short Rib Pappardelle and Chocolate Flourless Cake.  I ordered the Brie Brulee, Salmon Grenobloise and Crème Brulee.  Every dish was outstanding.  My Salmon was one of the best I have ever tasted, cooked perfectly and absolutely delicious.  Andrea checked on us appropriately, but we never felt we were rushed.  I am already planning to return with my husband for Brunch!
