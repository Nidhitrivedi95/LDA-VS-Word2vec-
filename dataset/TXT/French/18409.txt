A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g Four stars solely for the frasier cake, my favorite pastry they sell. It is layers of slivered almonds, fresh strawberries, whipped cream and dense white sponge. Three to two stars for everything else. The thing that baffles me about this patisserie is that they sell the classic french goods, but everything is so messy in its execution. The macarons are thick and haphazard. The palmiers are the same. The croissants are dense. The baguettes are almost sweet in flavor and have a crispy, crackly exterior and spongy interior. Where's the chew? We have tried every pastry and always resort back to the good old frasier. They recently increased the prices, but 5.25 for a huge slice is still extremely fair. We love their quiches in the cafe, but the french onion soup lacks that deep beefy, rich caramelized onion, salty flavor. The nicoise salad utilizes canned green beans, and I would expect some sort of rich oil-cured tuna. They could use a little polish, refinement, in their execution, and I often wonder the turn around on their product, because their cases are always fully stocked.
