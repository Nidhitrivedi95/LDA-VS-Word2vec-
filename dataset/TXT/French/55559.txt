rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Go. GO! Just do it.

Locals, visitors. Everyone should experience this place. As a local, I stray from the strip because of the higher prices and craziness, but this place is so worth it.

EVERYthing we had was amazing and exciting. Flavor combinations in some dishes that I would never expect. But so worth a try.

I could go on and on, but my fingers get tired. All I can say is this place is phenomenal... I still have fantasies about taking back my first experience so I could try it again for the first time...

The only regret I have is that the bf made the mistake the other night of trying out another "nice, delicious" french place called "Eiffel tower" and we still have regrets and sob over the money we spent there instead of here.
