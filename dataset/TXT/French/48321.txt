O66Zy8Y13VBm72ZDhS4fIg So I had a groupon voucher that was expiring soon, so I decided to make good use of it. This place is known for their yellow victorian home and is split between a cafe on the right and the fine dine on the left. We sat inside the dining area for this occasion. We sat by where the running little falls were against the tree wall. You hear the nice pleasant flow of water pouring down. One thing about fine dine I DO NOT like is the darkness! Its hard to see the menu and also the dish that is presented to you.

We presented the voucher to our server Walter and he handed us a pre-fixed groupon selection. 

For starters we got the beet salad and roasted bone marrow.

Ontario beets walnut crusted chèvre croquettes / field lettuce / pickled fennel /maple tarragon vinaigrette
- I thought the size for this is quite small, but then again it is a salad.
- I enjoyed the oven cooked cheese round balls.
- Not a big fan of arugula. Beets are new to me and I hear its healthy.

Wild mushrooms and Marrow garbanzo purée / roast garlic / lemon frisée / house crostini 
- First time trying bone marrow and it was a hit n miss for most ppl. For us, its a 'HIT'. Its like consuming melted fat. You pick it in between the bone and the flavour is really there. Two bones to enjoy the slitter meat fat in between.

Mains we got the Ontario Lamb Shank and ltsumo Tuna.

Ontario lamb shank 
ancho braised / northern bean tomato ragout / lamb sausage / garlic chips
- This was a good size drum stick meat. It was very tender and a bit fatty at the same time. My gf enjoyed it very much. I enjoyed it.
- Didn't like the bean tomato ragout.

Itsumo Tuna purple potatoes / edamame / kumato tomatoes / Sriracha emulsion / soy glaze
- Cooked right at medium rare tuna. Really enjoyable but only two rectangular pieces. 
- Noticed the purple potatoes and the kumato tomatoes.
- Didn't really taste the sriracha, but did taste the soy glaze.
- edamame beans were a few.

Desserts we got the churros and dark warm chocolate cake.

chocolate dark warm chocolate cake / vanilla ice cream / lime marshmallow white chocolate pistachio lollipop / raspberry sauce 
- hockey puck size of gooey chocolate flowing out as you cut it in the middle. Goes well with vanilla ice cream. Didn't really like the lollipop marshmallow.

churros Spanish donuts finished in cinnamon and sugar /chocolate chili / cajeta 
- Its alright. Not that impressive.

I also got a mixed non-alcoholic beverage that had grapefruit, orange juice, pineapple and ginger beer. It was quite tasty.

Overall this place gets a solid 4/5. Service was attentive and good. Food was good. Atmosphere was good. Just a little too dark for me. Only has one stall in the bathroom for men in the cafe area which is kind of sad. =(

After the groupon discount with tax and tip, I still shelled out an additional $35 for the dining experience.
