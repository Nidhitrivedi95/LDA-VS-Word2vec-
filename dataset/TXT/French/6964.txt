4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I came here for lunch/brunch and left pretty satisfied. I traded half of my french toast for half of my boyfriend's prime steak sandwich, which was an awesome idea because it was a good mix of savory and sweet. 

French Toast: Boyfriend claims it was the best french toast he's ever had! We ate the french toast after the sandwich, so I'm sure it was even better when it first came out. The french toast comes with blueberries, blueberry sauce, and whipped cream. 

Prime steak sandwich: It was the fanciest steak sandwich I've ever had, haha. Even better when dipped in the au jus. The flat fries they came out with were a nice change. If you love crispy fries (almost like potato chips), you'll love them, but my friend who prefers more fluffy french fries wasn't a fan.

Tip: if you're going to get the prime steak sandwich, take it easy on the complimentary baguettes & butter they bring out before your food comes. We didn't realize they use the same bread for the sandwich, so it was a baguette overload that day since we ate the complimentary baguettes like there was no tomorrow lol.

Even for a group of six people on a Saturday for lunch, we were seated very quickly. Although we sat outside where it was a bit chilly, there were heat lamps and we had a great view of the Bellagio water show :)
