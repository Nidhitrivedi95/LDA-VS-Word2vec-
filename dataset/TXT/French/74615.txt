xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g We just ate here tonight. All around amazing! The table and view were awesome. My boyfriend and I both ordered the salad and it was great. I ordered the salmon which was the best salmon I have ever had - so delicious. My boyfriend ordered the beef Wellington and potatoes Anna which were both great. We had the chocolate soufflé for desert and holy cow - amazing. Overall a wonderful experience for our date night!
