4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Hostess situation was bad.  Snotty young girls telling everyone they were sooo busy the wait would be forever.  We had reservations but were shuffled off into another line and told they didn't know when we would get seated.  We suffered the indignity of the hostess and were glad we did.  The waiter was very good and the food was amazing.   The restaurant  was steadily busy and the wait staff was handling it very well.  The view was good but if you get the opportunity to sit on the patio it would be awesome!  Not a place for quite conversation since it is fairly noisy but again the food and service was great.  Get the hostess situation under control and they would have a solid 5 stars.
