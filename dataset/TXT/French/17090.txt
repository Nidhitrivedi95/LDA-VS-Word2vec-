9ET_RUNztevq4_OLAX80Gg This was a great culinary experience, especially for the price. Our entire team at work and I are extremely picky, but we will all return. Highly recommend: roasted beet salad, warm lobster salad, nine herb angolotti, beef duo, bleuberry vacherin, and chocolate mousse cake. The soups and squash risotto were a little bland.
