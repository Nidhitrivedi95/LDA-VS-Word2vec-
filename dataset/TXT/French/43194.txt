lQ9VmIWvM6v-rONPkYX8aQ Vegas is a place to drop your money so don't be surprised to spend A LOT of it here.

I am always up to experience new restaurants so when my friend suggested Alex, I agreed without hesitation. From the moment you  step foot into Alex, you are greeted warmly and in awe from the beauty of the decor and service. My clutch was also pampered with a plush stool next to me.

To start the night off, there was a variety of 4 breads but I preferred the cranberry one. The Amuse Bouche - Carpaccio on bread sticks, ahi tuna tartare and butternut squash puree was also delightful.

We all chose the 7 course tasting at $195 versus the 3 course of $145. I enjoyed majority of the selections like:
* Marinated Yellowtail and Osetra Caviar 
* Roasted Sea Scallops with White Asparagus and Sea Urchin
* Seared Foie Gras with Sweet Onion, Cabbage and Black Truffle Consomme
* Japanese Wagyu Beef with Fava Bean Pure, Candied Shallots and Bordelaise Sauce - the sauce over powered the beef too much

I should have said something about the Daurade 'Royale' with Rhubarb, Caramelized Endives and Spiced Red Wine Syrup because the fish was over cooked and stuck to my teeth.

We opted to try the cheese platter for a supplemental $25 per person.

Of the 5 perfectly presented desserts, my fave was the Strawberries and Mascarpone Cream with Brown Butter Cake and Strawberry Sorbet. As if that is not enough, they also served fresh tiny madelines and petite fours.

Overall experience was great but I would not want to visit again because the meal didn't justify the price. At $300 per person, I had Fuji water only. I blame my own spoiled SF palate for the lack of excitement after the meal. The box of macaroon I walked away with was great for the late night snacking after some Vegas style partying.
