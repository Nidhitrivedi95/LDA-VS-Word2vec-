4cWrtMvfj-tomyEPgP7KFg I think this place (the food) is extremely overrated. The atmosphere is cool..the service was fantastic...BUT..the food was just ok, and for the price? Not worth it IMHO. I was really unimpressed with the meat. It was bland and tasteless. Even with the coq au vin broth you cook it in, it still was just ok. The best part was the chocolate dessert. That was awesome. Other than that, I won't be back unless it's just for dessert.
