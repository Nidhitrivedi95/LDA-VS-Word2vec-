The Terrace Cafe gets super packed during the weekend brunch service rush, so get ready for a bit of a wait.

PROTIP: The tables in the front near the bar, in the waiting area are first-come-first-served; so if you want to avoid an hour plus wait, snag one of those seats.

Onto the star of the show: the food is pretty solid here. The red velvet waffle was delicious and would highly recommend adding the fried chicken to that order. Otherwise, the food is very much brunch-like foods. 

The service was spot-on and we didn't have to wait very long for help. The coffee here is superb as well and tasty.

Pros: great food for Charlotte
Cons: the wait during the weekend is absurd
