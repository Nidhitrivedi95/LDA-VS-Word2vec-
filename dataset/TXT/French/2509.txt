Located next to the Bellagio fountain that makes excellent view and ambiance.  The restaurant is flourished with Picasso art and has a beautiful display of floral arrangements.  It felt comfortable and inviting.

Our table was located 2 tables away from the glass windows facing the fountain.  The food selection was limited, but each choices sound delectable.  

Price per person with drinks can be about $150+ per person. 

My favorite dish was the poached oyster for my appetizer.  It was delicious.  It taste like heaven.

We did experience something that was a little bit upsetting which was receiving a piece of plastic in my husband's foie gras pate.  It was the last bite in his appetizer course and we had told our server.  They had offer to get him something else but we didn't want anything more as our entree was coming.  They did take off the tab for that appetizer.

The dessert was a bit disappointing and we thought it was too sweet.

We did enjoy the restaurant and the staff.  Would like to come back again when I am in Vegas.

Recommend for dates, special occasions. Make Reservation!
