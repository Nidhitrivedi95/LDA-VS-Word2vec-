rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A When I found out that Thomas Keller had a restaurant in Vegas we were excited to try this place out. We heard great things about French Laundry but still have not had a chance to visit so this was out next best option. Unfortunately, our meal was only mediocre when compared to others in its class. 

When we dine at fine, upper echelon restaurants we try and compare it to others in the same class. We have been to many fine restaurants including Alinea, Brooklyn Fare, Per se, and Le Bernadin just to name a few. So I believe we know what good food is and what great food is. The meal we had here was good and I would definitely eat it again but I don't think that it really stands out in a city that boasts restaurants by Robuchon, Guy Savoy, Nobu, and Gordon Ramsay. 

The restaurant is a little difficult to find and you have to take a special elevator to get there. Be sure to give yourself plenty of time to find the place and don't hesitate to ask for directions if you get lost. As you walk into the restaurant you pass the oyster bar where you see chefs preparing seafood platters that look amazing, but we did not partake. We were seated and given menus that looked like they were printed on butcher paper. I really wasn't impressed with this and know they were going for a more casual feel, but I was more expecting more traditional menus given the Thomas Keller name. 

They didn't have a tasting menu, something we were really wishing they had so we ordered a la carte. The food we had was average for a fine dining establishment and the service was on par and good. I'm hoping that we went on an off day and would come back again but given the many different restaurants in the Vegas area, it may be sometime before we return.
