rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Bouchon is one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas.  Been here about 4 or 5 times for brunch and dinner and its always great.  I went here for dinner a few days ago and it was as good as always.  We started with the salmon app and their delicious crusty bread.  I had the mussels for my main course.  The bf had the kobe short rib special-awesome.  My sis-in-law had the halibut and my bro had the steak frites.  The desserts were amazing.  We had the ice cream trio- raspberry, peanut butter and grand marnier flavors and creme brulee...yummy!  Afterwards we got a tour of the kitchen, which is almost spotless clean!
