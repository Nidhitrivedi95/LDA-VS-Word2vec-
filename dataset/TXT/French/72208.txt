XKPosZx2j4RHcZ8Ewdwj0A Went for a late night dinner and ordered their crispy goat cheese salad and salmon pot au feu. The former was fine - though I'd probably order something different next time. The latter was marginal. The broth and veggies weren't very flavourful (though the salmon was fine). For me the highlight was the dessert (a blancmange). While nothing in the meal was outstanding, the late night menu is reasonably priced.

My friend had the short ribs and said they were excellent.
