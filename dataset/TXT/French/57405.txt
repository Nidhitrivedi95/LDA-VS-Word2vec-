rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Unbelievably horrible service.  The only reason I'm giving them 2 stars is because the beignets are incredible and worth a trip just to get them.  Aside from those, the service was deplorable.  We waited a solid 30 minutes for our food on a relatively slow late morning visit.  When I asked about the whereabouts of our meal, our server seemed surprised that I would even ask.  Then, our omelette was lukewarm and tasteless.  The French toast was great, though.  Overall, a truly terrible experience.  We did complain and got the price of the omelette taken off, but I still feel like we should have gotten the beignets and ran!
