9ot8oInkYZTt6wkkGe__vQ Auberge has been on my "bucket-list" of restaurants for some time.  I finally convinced a few friends to make the trek to North York for summerlicious.  While the service was excellent and the room lovely, the food was bland and disappointing.   I totally understand that during summerlicious high end restaurants are not always able to offer exactly the same kind of fare as they do on their regular menu when not quite as cost constrained - however - this meal did not make me want to go back again
