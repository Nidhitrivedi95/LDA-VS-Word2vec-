qTacF-_Iucc1Nxom_Za_5Q Underwhelming. I didn't find the food spectacular, just okay, nothing special. The steak tartar was bland and unmemorable. Foie gras was good but not anything different or special. The tartines were good but once again not memorable. The one thing that bothered me was that the menu just had names in French with no description. I'm not 100% bilingual but I can get by with my French, and even after translation you still couldn't really figure out what it was.  For example, "le grand aioli" which translates to "the big aioli".  What exactly does that tell me about the item?  When asked, it's an antipasto plate...how does "le grand aioli" let me know that?  A little pretentious.  Food was okay, but I would rather go elsewhere.
