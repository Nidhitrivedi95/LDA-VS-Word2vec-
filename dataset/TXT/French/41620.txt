kKC7UTcHZM3zLfT97x3msg This is a great restaurant. To start off the service was terrific. My red wine originally arrived quite cold and the attentive waiter replaced immediately on request and was quite apologetic. As a starter we got the Oysters Rockefeller- wow. Such a treat, especially as I don't usually enjoy oysters. If you are in the same boat- fear not! These are baked and smothered in hollandaise sauce and spinach with a crusty bread crumb topping. Sinful. I had the lobster as a main and it was delicious and not too rich. The bread and amuse-bouche were fun treats, but nothing special. The bread is baked in house we were told. For dessert we split the creme brulee. I have to say Scaramouche still wins for best creme brulee. Frank's needs to add more fresh vanilla IMO! Tip: When making a reservation ask to be seated near the back of the restaurant. We sat near the bar at the front and it was very busy with waiter traffic and often noisy/distracting.
