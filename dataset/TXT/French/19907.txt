aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw Favorite macaroons = lemon and chocolate.  I got the variety gift pack thingy and really did not like the other flavors (raspberry, vanilla, coffee, and I think it was pistachio?)  I really didn't like those flavors because they were either bland or way too artificial (raspberry).  Lemon and chocolate stood out because lemon was the perfect mix of tangy and sweet, and chocolate had the best ganache, wasn't too sweet (I'm a dark chocolate fan), and had a nice, velvety texture on the inside.  

Chocolate chip cookie was just okay.  I prefer mine chewy, and this one was very crispy and dense.

BUT, the tomato/feta/pesto foccaccia was TO DIE FOR!  A thick, moist, and fluffy slice of foccaccia with a layer of pesto, tasty roma tomatoes, and feta cheese on top.  Such a yummy snack prior to eating at the Wynn buffet.  The BF and I didn't eat lunch so that we could eat more at the buffet, but we needed a little snack to quiet the growls!
