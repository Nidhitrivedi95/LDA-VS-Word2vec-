noCKeynzdlWBQsVsAFZMpA Went tonight for a birthday celebration and our server Thomas was nothing short of spectacular. He was very knowledgeable of the menu and it's different options. He gladly offered his recommendations and explained them a bit further to us. We ordered the Foie Gras for an appetizer to split. It was amazing. Very well prepared. For entrees I got the Coq Au Vin which was good a little on the salty side and the rooster was alittle tough but overall very satisfying. My husband order the filet with frites. Exceptionally prepared and from what I tasted it was seasoned perfectly. We got the chocolate coffee dessert to end the evening. Thomas our server brought it out with a little candle for my birthday which was a nice touch. Overall I would highly recommend. Food was amazing and service was top notch.
