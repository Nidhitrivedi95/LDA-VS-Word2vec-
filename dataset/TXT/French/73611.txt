xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g My Mom and I had lunch at the ETR our last day (this past Fri).  It was the second time in 3 mths.  Really love everything about the restaurant -- food (classic mustard-crusted salmon paillard, frozen strawberry souffle with grand marnier ice cream), views (incredible seeing the Bellagio fountains from the ETR), service, etc.  It's starting to become tradition as our last LV meal!
