1cRvhC7shC6UneMqRYm4yg we went there because of the $59 groupon discovery menu for two that gives you 4 courses with wine pairings. We chose this place for my bday and it was a great experience and a great evening. All food and wine choices are nice. Especially liked the red wine that goes with the 4th course, some Italian Nero d'avola that smells so full of roses and tastes not bad either. Not to mention the music, cute bartender and thus overall ambience. Definitely will go again if I'm around and get a chance.
