hvjgF-vnPw2jyL5DBuB0qg Went here after a business trip to Montreal on a Friday around 6:30pm with no reservation (which clearly seems necessary if you aren't going solo. Got a seat at the bar next to the 3 rotating iPod DJ/ Oyster shucker. Stylish folk and not to crazy b/c it was still early. Service was great. The bartender was attentive and helpful.
Went with the tomato salad w/ avocado and those fluffy cheddar croutons which were phenomenal. Best and richest salad I can remember having. Then I went with the halibut which was quite tasty with the veal stock and sitting on a bed of pierogis.
 Only caveat is it's a wine place so beer selection was limited and lacking. Had a pilsner from Brewery Montreal that was just blah.
Overall Highly recommend! Go! Go now!
