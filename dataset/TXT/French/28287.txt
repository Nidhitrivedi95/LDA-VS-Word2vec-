eDtBCZDo92LqBCIfE45hhg Went there for dinner tonight with a bunch of cousins and friends. We drank a bottle of Dolcetto d'Alba (Italian red). The menu had an limited number of gourmet Entrees with fancy names. All nine of us chose different courses so we got to taste-test everything :) Deer, buffalo and haddock, each served with its unexpected mix of ingredients which all turned out to be great. Absolutely luved it!
