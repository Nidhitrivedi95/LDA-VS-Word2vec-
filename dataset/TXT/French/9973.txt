4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Great spot right on the strip. Lunch and breakfast are perfect for a heavy day of walking. The breakfast benny's are all good (tried them all) as well as the Nutella waffles. Make a reservation and prepare for $15 a person plus drinks. One of my fave spots to eat directly on the strip.  Great spot for the whole family if you sit outside.
