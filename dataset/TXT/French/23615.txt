cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg I can't say much that hasn't already been said.  There were 7 adults in our party and I made sure to have at least one bite of everything that came to the table.  In a nutshell... everything was decadent, rich and delicious.  There weren't many plates (appetizer or main course) that came to the table without some pork &/or foie gras on it.

For appetizers we had the foie gras "tout nu" - a traditional serving of foie gras on crostini with a balsamic glaze, fried squash blossoms served with aioli, onion soup gratinee - I don't believe there was a single bite without cheese, the cochonailles platter - essentially a charcuterie plate comprised completely of pork products, and the tarragon bison tongue - which was tender and flavorful.

Based on all other rave reviews, one member of our party ordered the Duck in a Can... yum.  Other entrees included the ridiculously large portioned foie gras burger - aka heart attack on a bun, lamb shank - the only entree complaint came from the bland hot tomatoes on top of the dish, meatloaf - topped with a generously sized piece of foie gras, steak frites, halibut special of the day, and the PDC melting pot.

Next time we find ourselves in Montreal, we'd be hard pressed to pick an alternative to Au Pied De Cochon.  It was well worth the trip.
