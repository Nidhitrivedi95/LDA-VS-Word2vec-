0Xr0kte9ADAfZ-GBO-wimg No good!  The food here is really bad!  Whyyyyyyyyy.

I had dinner here with a friend visiting Toronto, and we ordered the brie croquette, the shrimp in Pernod sauce, and the orange duck, and we both agreed that it tasted like Stanford dining.  Which isn't bad, but Stanford dining is all you can eat for $10 bucks each, and I was a little saddened by the fact that we were paying so much for food so mediocre.

The deep fried brie was not a great idea because the flavors don't match (wild berries + brie that really tastes like a jalapeno popper?). The duck was done medium rare as the chef suggested but way worse than what you'd get at a Chinese deli, and both dishes were served with standard blanched zucchini and broccoli.  The shrimp was done in your usual red sauce.  Very whatever.  There are better, cheaper eats out there, Toronto.
