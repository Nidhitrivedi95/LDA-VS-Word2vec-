LjOBNcNNpuewBqSPxYYTJQ Wow!  Having just moved to Charlotte exactly a month ago, I wanted to try Amelie's with all the accolades it gets.  But, I was very disappointed.  The croissant was nothing special (any local grocery store could have made it) and it had sweet taste to it.  All of the chicken salad inside was rough, chewy chicken.  The side salad I got with the half sandwich was good and made with fresh greens and it tasted like homemade salad dressing.  I thought the iced tea had a light fruity taste and was fresh brewed.  But, this is what through me...the orange macaron.  It was frozen and I opened it to see what the yummy filling looked like.  There was a tiny plop and that's it :(...posted the pic of my sad macaron under photos.
