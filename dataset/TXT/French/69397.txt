wf6cEXlL1qkNGH0-_CjKMw This is a review of my Summerlicious experience from some months ago which I've been meaning to get around to, so here we go.

Me and my S/O made reservations to come here thinking it was probably some sort of hidden gem; not very popular, but great reviews nonetheless for its authentic French cuisine. Upon arrival, we entered our very small resto with the main age demographic pushing near 70. That was okay though since we were there for the food, senior citizens cafeteria vibes be damned!  Well, the food itself was average at best - we both started with a mussel salad (puny), I got the quiche (meh), and finished with a flan cake (had better at Portuguese bakeries). Perhaps I'm not the best judge on what qualifies as "authentic" French food, but if it's anything like LPF then I'm not a fan.
The service wasn't any better; there was only one waiter working the floor and despite being rather empty on that afternoon, he frequently got our orders mixed up with the table beside us. He seemed pretty uninterested the entire time, which just compounded our already lackluster dining experience.
Overall, boring food and tepid service/hospitality for our Summerlicious experience, how it still attracts business is beyond me.
