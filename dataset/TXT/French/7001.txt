I'd recommend the french onion soup, chicken liver pate, and mushroom crepe.

Also, the view seating outside is nice because you get a good look at the Bellagio water fountain show.

Everything on the Las Vegas strip is priced relatively on the higher end, that being said, this place gives a good bang for buck.
