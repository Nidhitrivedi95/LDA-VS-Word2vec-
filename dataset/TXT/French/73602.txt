It was certainly tantalizing to our taste buds. We also had the duck and beef Wellington plate, as well as green beans and potato croquette for our sides which were all extremely well prepared as well. Jon Paul took very good care of us. He was personable, attentive, and good at anticipating needs in advance. He also gave us a complimentary anniversary dessert that was nice and a very good ending to our meal. This was my third visit here, and they never cease to impress. I am a Vegas local, so I'm sure I will be making another trip soon.
