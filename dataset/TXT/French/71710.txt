xeFVRUjxorxjO_qjX8FNdw Came here with some friends for lunch. Okay service and speed, but nothing special. It was a clean place and many people came in to check out the desserts.

The food was ok and good price. Apparently they recently added a side of fries to the menu because you could only get salad previously. I found a decent amount lobster shells in my lobster wrap, which spoiled the experience. In a restaurant, service may vary, but questionable food preparation makes the restaurant, well, questionable... I was given the bill, and after I paid cash, they added another item to the bill without explanation along with the change, which was strange.
