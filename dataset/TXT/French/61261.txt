SJo_IjvzdRtCvZVN0cbrRQ My review has two parts, one for brunch and one for dinner. The meals have different chefs and styles of dining. The breakfast is excellent. There are some standard items along with specials for variety. One thing I'm happy about is they now have pancakes, my favorite breakfast food, on the menu more often, where as they didn't so much before. Pancakes are how I measure the quality of a breakfast place, and The Blue Door's are some of the best I've ever had. Their other dishes such as French Toast or corned beef hash are also excellent.

Dinner is a whole different style from lunch, with white tablecloths and a special four-course menu each week. There are normally two choices for appetizers, soup/salad, and dessert, and around four for the entree, including vegetarian. What I like about the arrangement is that each time we go I get to try something new. Recently when picking a restaurant for my birthday I went through a bunch of restaurants from nice Cleveland restaurants. Nothing jumped out at me. I finally checked the Blue Door's menu and immediately saw things I wanted. We went and had a great meal.

By the way, come Valentine's Day we went to the upscale Pier W in Lakewood, because we do like to try different places. While it was good, we both found ourselves thinking that we would have had an even better meal at The Blue Door and saved ourselves a long drive.

The Blue Door also has a bakery up front, where you can get real good bread and a variety of sweet rolls.

Regarding pricing, breakfast is $$, dinner is more like $$$$. In both cases you get real good food for your money.
