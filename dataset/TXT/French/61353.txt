SJo_IjvzdRtCvZVN0cbrRQ I've been going here since it changed from Golden Goose to Angel Falls and now to Blue Door Cafe.  The food was okay, but hard to justify the price. Might've rated it higher but the waiter was talking to customers behind us and he criticized people who order the bacon and eggs...meanwhile one of the people at our table had ordered the bacon and eggs.  Pretty rude. I'll stick to Garrett's Mill in Stow or Piatto Novo down at the Sheraton for breakfast.
