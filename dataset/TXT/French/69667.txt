WOd8tWsh2Yt_osHv-ngx_w My friend brought me here the other day for a quick lunch on my break from classes and her break from work. I ordered the pesto, tomato and bocconcini sandwich on a small baguette bread. The French fries came in a mini basket made to put in the deep fryer which is a very cool idea I've never seen before. My sandwich was delicious and made the perfect lunch. My friend had a brie an mushroom omelette and said it was good also. After our meals we ordered a small chai and an iced mochachino... both very good and definitely hit the spot. We sat in a covered outdoor porch with a few other people so I believe our waitress forgot we were there at times, she took a long time to appear after we were finished our meal and wanted to order some drinks. For lunch time when everyone is on a schedule she should have been more efficient. However, the food was great and I would recommend this place to anyone because the menu is so eclectic you are bound to find something to satisfy any craving. :)
