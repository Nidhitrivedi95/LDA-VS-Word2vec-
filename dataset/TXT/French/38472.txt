JJ1Ruu37kn66YSWUmCKNCw This little BYOB spot is definitely a little over priced for the quality f the food. I went out there with 4 people and we some good seafood served to us. The pasta on the other side was decent, but was not restaurant worthy, more like a home cooked pasta dish.
All in all i would recommend it for the atmosphere, but keeping in mind the price for the quality of food
