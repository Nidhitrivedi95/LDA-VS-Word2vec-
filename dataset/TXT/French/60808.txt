SCklYa_jhihWAcfIn-_chg Living on the east side, I've had brunch here about 5 times. Good food, decent service. So, why two stars? The place is dirty - actually,  it's filthy. Come for the French toast, stay for the caked on foreign food particles on coffee mugs/plates/cutlery, and tablecloths covered in crumbs. It's disgusting!
