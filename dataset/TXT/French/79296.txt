ZgiSgTwHOoxdfi0unI36Mg On our last night in Montreal, at Le Westin, we were unsure as where to eat. Too lazy to do any more research or walking, we decided to try Gazette, which we had noted, but sadly overlooked the preceding days. We were early, just between the tapas and dinner menus, and were told we could order from either; we chose the tapas.
Well, these plates were not small, and were flat out fantastic! I ordered Angus sliders and poutine; my wife ordered the same sliders with a side Caesar salad. Shortly thereafter we received an entire table of food! The tasty sliders were accompanied by French fries, and were a portion unto themselves. My poutine was served in a small cast iron skillet, and consisted of sliced fingerling potatoes (rather than French fries), cheese curd and very tasty brown gravy. On top was a small portion of baby back ribs--fantastic! My wife's "side" salad was a full portion and delicious. We were a bit overwhelmed by both the quantity and quality of this meal. Was perfect after a day of walking through the city, a museum and the Underground City. Highly recommended.
