i5vxtyiHKYnRcJ0p9N7mLw I don't know how this place has nearly 5 stars? We had the chicken parmesan sandwich and it was the blandest I've ever had. The chicken and breading had no flavor and the sauce just tasted like tomato sauce? Waste of money, we threw them away after trying several bites hoping it would get better. I was really sad because I *wanted* to love this place. Guess I'll continue to make the drive to DeFalcos for my chicken parm sandwich craving. 
The ratings are so high from other yelpers that I'll go back and try something else and update my review but until then I'm just bummed!
