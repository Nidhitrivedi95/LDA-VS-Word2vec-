The shish taouk tasted ridiculously healthy, which would normally put me off.  However, the beef was quite flavourful, as were the ingredients placed into the sandwich.  I'm not 100% sure, but the hummus could have been store-bought.  Nevertheless, it tasted good and I felt quite energized after eating it.  The chicken shawarma was tastier than the shish taouk (albeit greasier with the garlic sauce).  My partner lamented about the lack of toasting on the pitas (oh Boustan, why can you not open a location on the shore), but the sandwiches still stood up pretty well, despite the lack of warmth.

The bad:

Being a lover of potatoes with garlic sauce/mayo, I was disappointed.  Upon first sight, the potatoes were the most gorgeous shade of golden-brown... a visual testament to their crispy goodness.  The reality, however, had me feeling deceived and robbed of deliciousness.  The potatoes were greasy and the garlic mayo was a congealed mess that failed to coat the overly-greased and soggy potatoes.  A "fail" on two fronts.

Would I come back again?

Sure, I've experienced better, but I would come back again.  I am willing to overlook the potato debacle in favor of the flavorful pitas.  I am even more enticed by the "shish taouk poutine," which I intend on feasting upon my next visit.
