UxWH8zRYIBgs6Q2oykvRdw The WORST and most HOSTILE costumer service I've ever experienced!! The waitress not only spilled the drink all over our table and clothes, she never apologized for that. She even gave us an attitude. The appetizer came first then the bread and butter!! When we asked her about the bread she said: "I have another table to serve, too"!! We ordered burgers, she did not even asked how would we want the meat to be cooked!!After we complained to the manager regarding this unprofessional behavior they only gave us a free desert. The waitress, MIRANDA never apologized and that was not acceptable in any shape or form!! Nobody should be treated the way MIRANDA treated us!!
