B56AYe5GNuavMDtwFsXqzA I really enjoyed dining here.  It's a small space inside but plenty of tables outside.  The flowers, the exposed beams, large bar - great atmosphere.  

I sat at the bar which is good for dining alone.  The bartender is very friendly.  I had the foie gras and the pork belly for dinner.  The foie gras was ok because the brioche was over powering with to much sweetness.  The pork belly is divine.  The meat melts in the mouth, and the butternut squash and bacon bits compliment each other very well.    The only problem is both dishes are so high in fat and I had to forgo the very popular cream bulee......  Another disappointment is that they don't have an espresso machine and only french press coffee.

It's a great spot to stop by when visiting here.  Great date spot as well.
