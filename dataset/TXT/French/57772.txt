rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Came here with my parents a couple years ago and enjoyed it very much. The restaurant was beautiful and the service was good as well. The front of the house as well as what I saw of the back seemed very professional. 

As far as bistro food goes, I suspect this place is about as good as it gets in Vegas. Other than baguettes and pistachios I don't remember eating anything noteworthy as an appetizer, but for the entree I ordered a grilled Atlantic salmon with veggies. I enjoyed the gamy flavor of the fish but the main reason I ordered it was because I wanted to sample the style of cooking fish shown in Thomas Keller's Bouchon cookbook. It was only grilled on one side, with that side being browned and well-done and the other side left completely raw. This gives an interesting texture to the fish and I enjoyed it. After the entree I noticed a big oyster bar so I ordered some Kumamoto oysters, which were very good as well.

Recommended.
