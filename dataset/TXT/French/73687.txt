xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g 1.Best Romantic Restaurant in Vegas with Great View of the Bellagio Fountain (make sure to call for a reservation instead of booking through open table to get a table by the window). Perfect fo Anniversarries, birthdays any special occassion,  It makes the ocassion very memorable. But i'll make up any excuse to my fiancee just to go back there again.. lols 

2.AWESOME SERVICE. Our server paid very much attention to us. Even got a Complimentary Chocolate Dessert from them, the chef put it on a plate and wrote HAppy Anniversarry on the edges of the plate. It was so beautiful. It made us feel so special..

We don't drink and unfortunately they don't serve any unalcoholic drink but we told him we wanted something just for a toast and surely after a few minutes he came back with a couple of flutes, though I dont recall what it was called his effort to get us something they dont serve is outstanding.

Service is FAST too., unlike other fine dining restaurants which takes 30 minutes to get your food done.

3.REASONABLE Price for a fine dining restaurant with a great view. We paid the same thing at Sutro's in SF and Sutro's food wasnt even as good.

4.EXCELLENT FOOD! make sure you try their FOI GRAS with grilled grapes... yummy.., it melts in your mouth.

5.The only thing is that tables are kind of close to one another so you actually hear the conversations from the other tables., But we got one of the best tables right infront of the Bellagio Fountain so were Happy nonetheless..

Would Definitely be back there Again next visit!!! :)
