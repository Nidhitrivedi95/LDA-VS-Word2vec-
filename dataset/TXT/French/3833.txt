2B46bRpDh49eDyjXGhL_ZQ So hospitable and the crepes are the best I've had... 

We had the Marion (tomato, mozzarella, pesto) w/chicken, the Lauren (Nutella, strawberry, whipped cream), the Nancy (egg white, turkey, spinach), and the Matt (cheese, mushrooms, chicken). I had a great espresso and they even treated us to a free Alex (pear, caramel, cinnamon). All absolutely delicious!

Had interesting conversation about France... and they use imported French flour (less processed, no bleaching). The kids absolutely loved the French imported Kinder chocolate eggs with toys in them. Would totally recommend this place to anyone
