mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q This was a great disappointment. My boyfriend booked a surprise dinner for the two of us for Valentines Day at MGM. I had been dying to dine here for months.  I found the found uninspired and bland. The reservation time was for 8pm, but we were told that they were backed up. We were asked to wait at the bar and offered champagne. We assumed the champagne was complimentary since our reservation was an hour late... At 9:15 we were handled a $120 bill for the champagne. Awesome. We dined n the tasting menu with wine pairing. I wasn't totally into the food.
