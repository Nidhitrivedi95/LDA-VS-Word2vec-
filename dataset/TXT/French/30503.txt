fVF5wayDyY6ZR5oJB1IK3g The Mile End hipster scene has gone off the deep end and Lawrence is the proverbial Pied Piper leading the pack. Between the plastic wayfarer glasses, bouffant Elvis cuts, and faux-rustic military watches on NATO straps, you'd think you'd died and gone to hell - until you try one mouthful of the baked sunnyside up eggs with celeriac and mushrooms, in which case you'll think you died and went to heaven

The breakfast is absolutely outstanding from what everyone else tells me. I wouldn't know because I can't stop ordering that Baked Eggs/Celeriac dish over and over and over again. It's like the Mona Lisa of breakfast recipes, absolutely perfect. The coffee is pretty good, too.

The waitstaff is really friendly and give off that neighborly vibe, and the patrons are easygoing and patient, which is important because space is at a premium and the lineups can get heavy on weekends. Otherwise the decor is nothing to write home about - mix-n-match vintage vibe with a touch of industrial chic thrown in.

450-ers, read 'em and weep - this is what a breakfast place should be.
