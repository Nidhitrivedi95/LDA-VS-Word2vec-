-4TMQnQJW1yd6NqGRDvAeA I hosted a bridal shower brunch for my friend here and it was a wonderful experience.  The staff made the entire event incredibly easy to plan and they went out of their way to make it a special day for my friend.  Everyone loved the food and the atmosphere and the prices were very reasonable for what you got.  Thanks again!
