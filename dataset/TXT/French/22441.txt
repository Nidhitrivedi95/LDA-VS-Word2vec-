BSmqxPbQglQwP2R56OqOag Just ate here for our anniversary for the first time.. It was really good. Service was great and we were greeted right when we walked in. We ordered the pork tenderloin which was really good and the steak frites was good as well. I would go for the pork tenderloin next time over the steak. Oh we also started off with drunk bread.. It was really good.. It does have wine in it and I can definitely taste it.
A guy also came to our table to ask us how are meal was and make sure we were happy and gave us the names of the managers just in case we had any feedback. We also got a dessert no charge because we were first time customers.. I have no idea what he said it was but it was delicious! I would totally recommend this place!
