AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw I ordered a large cafe mocha at Payard for $7.50. Asked for soy milk due to lactose intolerance.  The problem was that the mocha did not taste like mocha, it tasted like hot soy milk.  This place is supposed to be famous for chocolate but I don't know why because it's not in the mocha.
