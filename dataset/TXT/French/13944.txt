50-xiTYmE6NERi-yJ6NvHw There's so little good French in Toronto so I decided to give Biff's a try. After all, Toronto Life gave it three stars!

The room is attractive and the service was fine if a touch too earnest. I was asked three times how my entree was.

A salad of Boston hearts was near perfect.

Then the beef bourguignon came. This classic had been horribly tampered with. The bulk of the dish was strips of rubbery asian mushrooms that added nothing to the taste. To add insult to injury, they had been laid out in an elaborate crosshatch pattern over the plate that was distinctly unappetizing to gaze on. 

Clearly this was a "creative' chef
but I am desperate for a 'competent' one in this town who can execute
the basics consistently. I would be loath to come here again and see how other favorites have been ruined.

Every time I go to a restaurant that TL likes I am disappointed, while other places I love get scant notice from them. Flavour just isn't a criteria for them I guess.

I wish I could use this space to recommend another French restaurant in the city but I have not found one I liked! And the last time I went to Manhattan I had two wonderful French meals, just walking into places I happened upon. Toronto can really be a drag sometimes.
