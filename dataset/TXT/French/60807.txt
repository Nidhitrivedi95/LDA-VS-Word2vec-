SCklYa_jhihWAcfIn-_chg Reviews seemed to be mixed, - but I don't think it's fair to the people who give it a low review.

The seating is rather limited in the winter, the patio double's its size, there can only be fifteen tables in the restaurant - so of course good food attracts people, and people don't like to wait too long for good food.  

I used to work around the corner, so for lunch, it was easy to get in and get out un-scathed - the entire menu is delicious - though I recommend the custard tarts over anything - and the marmalade - it is the only place that warms my brunch soul.
