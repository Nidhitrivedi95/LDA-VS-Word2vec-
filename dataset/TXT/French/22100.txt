Caren's is a lovely spot after attending a Feature Presentation at The Cumberland or for a late-night snack. I've been for dinner as well, but the place is a wee bit understaffed for a truly blissful dining experience.

If you love unpasteurized, ripe and rare cheese, look no further than Caren's. They have it all. I particularly enjoy their vast array of accompaniments you can order with your cheese. The staff know their stuff and are great at steering your charcuterie board. Bring a friend or date and get your Cheese On!
