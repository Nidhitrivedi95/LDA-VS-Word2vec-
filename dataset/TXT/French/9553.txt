4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw First time visit last weekend. We were a party of 18. I had the steak au poivre. OH SOO YUMMY! The sauce was to die for. THE FRIES.. you have never had fries like this.. and they went so well with the sauce. Someone ordered the muscles and the sauce and the muscles were also delicious!
The French baguettes they serve with your meal was great. WE had Different sides and all were good. We ordered a few desserts and also all were devoured..
I conducted a survey of our party of 18 and everyone LOVED THE PLACE!
The service was great too.
Place is a bit noisy, though I am sure our party added to the noise!
You can sit outside and have a beautiful view of the Bellagio fountains!
Bon Appetit!
