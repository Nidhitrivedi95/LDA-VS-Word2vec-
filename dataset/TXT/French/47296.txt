O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q Came here for a private affair and loved every minute of it. They started us off in a room where the windows were completely open and the servers we're extremely attentive. We then went in to eat dinner which was a fixed menu. B Alaskan crab legs were soft and succulent. The shrimp refresh and pretty darn big. The beet salad was awesome although I wasn't a fan of the greens in the salad. For dessert I had a new take on blonde. It also had garnishes of pineapple and mango sauces. All in all it was a great experience.
