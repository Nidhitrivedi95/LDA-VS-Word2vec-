rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I got the famous chicken and waffles. The chicken skin was cooked delicately, with just enough crisp. I could eat the skin all day. The chicken, however, was on the dry side unfortunately, even with the gravy. Maybe it is just that hard to cook chicken breast. The dark meat was a little better, but I've definitely had much better chicken from places with much less stars and dollar signs. What saved it were the waffles. They were pleasantly different from regular run-of-the-mill waffles. It is salty and fluffy with just a touch of crispiness. After adding the syrup, it is even more perfect. I would come back for the waffles by itself. 

My boyfriend had the salmon eggs benedict. The smoked salmon was on the salty side, so each bite took a little more muffin and eggs to balance things out. Eggs were cooked to perfection and the salad worked well with the rest of the dish. 

Their apple raspberry cheese danish is delicious -- this is coming from a person who doesn't care for apples. Apples weren't too tart or mushy; the pastry was light and had a gentle crunch. It is just sweet enough to make me want more. 

We had a very tentative server, who was always there at the right time. He explained any questions we had and was super friendly.
