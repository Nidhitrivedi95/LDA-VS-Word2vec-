gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA Treated the wife for her birthday with a   Tracelzoo deal for a six course tasting dinner.

We arrived and were immediately seated at the front facing the strip. The place is on the 56th floor, so the view was spectacular.

Right off the bat I will say that the service was spectacular.  Friendly informative wait staff.  Cudo's to Marcos, our main waiter.  Everything was explained before ordering, and upon each item arriving at the table, we got a detailed description of each dish.

We both enjoyed the meal, but for both of us it was a very expensive night with very small portions of very tasty food.  It was literally a "tasting" portion of each dish.

Groupon was $149.00, plus tax, plus a %18 gratuity.  The travelzoo deal stated they would add %15 not %18. We did not quibble because the service was great. We ordered caviar and a glass of wine each and our total tab with the deal price we paid came out to $306.00! 

One time shot for us.
