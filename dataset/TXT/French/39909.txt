K64Uw3a2Enh2MznpwRHWKQ My first time at Razz last night with a group of 25. They really brought their "A" game to service us. I'm told that they are always busy...even on a Tuesday night. Hate going to a restaurant and it's 1/4 full. Scares me. This place was hoping and we added to it. 

The space is done just about right...contemporary and not pretentious. We had plenty of choice on entree's (not the whole menu) and with 25 people in our group...I think I saw the bulk of the menu. I had the Bouillabaisse and guest to the right had the halibut and to the left had the short ribs. Immpressive portion was my first immpression on my dish and others as well. The broth was light, not chunky and heavy, perfect consistency as this is a soup and not a stew necessarily. Well, it was cooked perfectly and seasoned well- flavors were subtle, no one flavor overpowered the soup, and the tomato base was light. I like a little more wine flavor coming through but was not disappointed. I wish I knew how to give a half star here because Razz is not at a 5 but it could get 4 stars here. 

Oops....salad, very imaginative, and combined 8 or 9 ingredients and again, the portion was very immpressive. They have a long life in the restaurant business, get there and enjoy.
