4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I came here on Sunday with my sisters and well lets just say if I think French, I think really good savory crepes. Well to my surprise it wasn't that great. There wasn't much of a selection to begin with. So I settled with the chicken, broccoli, and cheese crepe. First bite I thought it was me thinking it was so salty. Comes to find out it was just the broccoli that is seasoned to salty. We also order the tuna melt sandwich. I don't know about you but when I order a tuna sandwich anything I expect it not to be fishy. I'm sorry I have to say was way too fishy for my liking. It was so bad the waiter notice we were not fond of it and took it off our bill. So she made up for the lack of not being so attentive with refilling our drinking or bring out more bread. But the thing that was good was the hand cut fries. Very thin and crispy just like potato chips  also the one thing that I did love besides the fries was there special! The Shaved Beef and Brie Sandwich with Sun-Dried Tomato Aioli. This was to die for! It was the perfect amount to have so you can last until dinner time. It doesn't sit heavy when you are done either which is a plus on my book. I would come back to mon ami gabi just for that. If we didn't order that I would never step foot back here.

Also a little side note, for some reason the hosts are not so friendly. Waiters inside are a little better. When the host took us inside to get seated I had on high boots so I have to walk slow cause of the tile floors they have are a little slippery. One of the waiter push be faster to walk cause she forgot someone order making me almost trip... Just saying don't wear heels here ladies.
