xaqW4NkmUCGRRjmLxiFJ6Q All I can say is WOW, this place rocks. I decided to try Muncheez out after reading  all the positive reviews. I was not at all disappointed. I started coming here several months ago and I think I've had about every crepe on the menu so far. The only thing is that every time I order a different crepe, its better than the last one I had which I thought could not be possible. You also must try my favourite drink, fresh sugar cane juice. I order mine with fresh mint leaves, lemon juice and ginger, totally refreshing, healthy and addictive. Ramen and his entire staff go  above and beyond to make you feel at home, I promise, you will not be disappointed.
