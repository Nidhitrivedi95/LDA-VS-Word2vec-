uP3H5bcsiTXM0k0xQhRndg Found this place based on it's yelp reviews. It's a small family establishment and the menu is relatively limited.

I was a bit surprised at the set up of the place. It's smaller than I expected. The plastic seats made it look like a fast food place vs a restaurant.
They do have an upstair seating area, and the live band places downstairs. If you seat downstairs it's a bit more snug fit vs upstairs. You can't see band upstairs but you hear them well. 

Onion soup (with Jalapeño)- 
This was a big bowl of soup. Definitely can be shared by 2 people. I am not the biggest fan of onion soup but the jalapeño gave it a nice kick.

The Ultimate Experience - I love pork belly so i couldn't wait to taste this. Not their fault but my palate did NOT like the Celery Root puree (I think that's what it was). I never had it before but eck, I realize now that I am not a fan. The other puree on the plate was on the sweeter side so I used that to offset the celery root flavor. 
Pretty much the celery root taste made not enjoy the dish as much.
I was pretty full off the soup so i did end up taking this dish home. 

A friend of mine can't stand cilantro in ANY dish, now i guess I understand how she feels. 

One other thing I didn't like,  the bread that was served with the soup and entree would have been good except it was HEAVILY slobbered in butter.   I couldn't enjoy it. I even tried scrapping some of the butter off... 

Pistachio Creme Brûlée-
Good combination. Light and not too sweet. Good portion.

The staff were very nice and even though if you seat upstairs you feel far away and you hope they didn't forget about you, they do come up to check on you often. 
I didn't get to try the mac and cheese which also seem to be crown favorite, so maybe next time. If they had it in smaller portion I prob would have ordered it for take away vs an entree size portion.
