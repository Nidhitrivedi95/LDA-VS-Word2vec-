gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg We were two hot and tired tourists who needed to eat RIGHT NOW. We were on St. Catherine's.  The place we'd planned to dine at was closed.  We were seated, and I almost thought it was a mistake to come here. It looks like an aging Bennigans.  I was ready to bolt when our waiter came to take care of us.  I am glad we stayed.  Our flatbread style pizza was delicous!! The crust was thin, and the cheese had a delicous flavor that mixed nicely  with the vegetables on the dish.  We also had salad (ok for 3.49) and onion rings.  My dining partner ordered the onion rings, and it wasn't until the bill came that I saw the price:  8.99!!!! Our server stated that it was because it was real beer batter.  Well, I still don't think that justifies 8.99 for onion rings!! At any rate, it was a solid choice that afternoon.
