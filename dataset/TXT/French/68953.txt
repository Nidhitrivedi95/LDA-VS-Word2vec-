VwZhwflLnTq19aAeFLJHCQ Bernard's is one of the Best restaurants in Henderson, if not all of Las Vegas off the strip. I recently ate there on pairing night and it was spot on. The appetizer started with prosecco, a winner in my book, that was matched with a perfectly cooked artichoke. Then a salad with rose, followed by Salmon with pinot noir. All food was presented with the beauty and flair that is a staple at Bernard's, and The flavors were varied and delicious. They do the prix fixe menu once a month and it's clear they are exercising their creativity with these meals. I highly recommend it, or even just a regular dinner or lunch.
