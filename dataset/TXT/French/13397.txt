4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I got food poisoning here from eating their quiche. Everyone else in my group was complaining about how their food was bland and all of our plates came out cold (we ordered things like scrambled eggs and French onion soup so it definitely shouldn't have been cold). The service was additionally super slow even though the restaurant was empty besides our group and a few others. I'm not really sure why this place has such high ratings sorry to say it.
