kIW8IeTV3W1tS_q_WAU4wQ The food is realllly good. Its service is amazing and the chef's creations are always changing which makes me always wanna go back !!! 
The ambience is so nice and romantic and the only thing though is missing in my opinion is a little bit of music. 
What I like about the place is you get to watch the kitchen and the chef's cooking and it so pleasant and entertaining. I loved every bit of my evening there and is definitely a place i want to go back to especially in winter!
