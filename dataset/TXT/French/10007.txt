4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I can only give 4 stars this visit. I was disappointed  that  the  make your own bloody mary bar is gone. The staff stated that it was hugely popular but high maintenance.  We sat on the beautiful patio which faces the strip. It was peaceful for about 5 minutes.  Soon a street performer parked himself  about 100 ft. From the restaurant on the sidewalk and began to play LOUDLY! The wait staff stated that he is there daily. Nobody seated outside  was enjoying his 5 song repeat set after set. You couldn't  hear your tablemates talk. Thats how loud he was! I am pretty stunned that the restaurant  puts up with him. Some people  asked to move inside  because he was so disruptive.  
As for the food. It was excellent!!!! The bloody mary was also excellent!!! The service was excellent.  
I will  sit inside next time. Hopefully  they ditch the guitar dude!!
