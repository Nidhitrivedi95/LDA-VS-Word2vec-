gpY1RzC3aAPTqsx27GMtsw I read the other reviews that said how the food here is overpriced. How the soup came with a fly. How the entrees just didn't taste good. But all I wanted was a beer, just a beer, how could they get that wrong? The server was friendly, got me a beer menu, and I got a beer on tap - great. But when it came, there were TWO flies in the beer! Oh well, napkin-ed them out, still a good beer.

Two stars instead of one because of the beer selection.
