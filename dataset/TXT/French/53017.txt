QeFsIMcIFIJcOrpthYL8jg Made reservations for a wedding anniversary, specifically noting the occasion and requested to be seated in the same room as the music was being played. Upon arriving, hostess did not say a word... seating us in a table where we could hear the music but not what we asked for. 
Server was ok, but seemed like he was running around as the place was understaffed. The food itself was very good. Main complaint came with dessert. Ordered a spiked coffee and tiramisu. The tiramisu came immediately and the waiter claimed at that moment that he would be right back with the drink. 15 min go by, he's nowhere to be seen. We finish the dessert and now don't want the coffee. 
I get up to tell the waiter to cancel, he now has the drink.  He gets to the table and tells us that it's not French custom to serve coffee with dessert - turns out this is 100% true. Ok, cool, but 3 factors here: 1.) we're clearly not from here and got confused by his statement that the drink was coming right up 2.) he was missing in action for so long we couldn't even ask about it. 3.) maybe it's us, but we felt like he was speaking down to us... given the cost of the food, we expected more of an "I'm sorry" and that would have been enough.

He comped the dessert, which was nice, and even brought another one, but by that point the meal was done, and the offense was taken. Call us stupid Americans if you will, but this area is all tourists, so you need to at least consider who's paying your tab.

This was our second time here, the last time with friends 2 years ago, and due to the service, will also be our last.
