KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA I LOVE this restaurant! It's one of my top favorite places. The service is good but what takes it to the top is the beautiful location and the delicious menu.
The area was originally built by Steve Wynn. It overlooks the lake. I've tried many selections from their menu but my favorite is the Chicken with Forbidden Rice. The rice is almost like a risotto with chicken broth and White Asparagus sauce. I also had the Vanilla Panna Cotta today.
They also have a great wine selections since they are also a wine shop. I like to order the J. Lohr Chardonnay since I've never seen it offered at other places by the glass.
