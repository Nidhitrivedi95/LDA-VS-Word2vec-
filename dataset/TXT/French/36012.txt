hvjgF-vnPw2jyL5DBuB0qg delicious dishes, fresh ingredients, excellent service by joe at the bar. Great atmosphere!! even though we almost miss the place but we made it as #1 customer on that day. Been grateful to taste matane  shrimp and  jerky crab, stuffed trout with oysters, and finished with molasses cake.
