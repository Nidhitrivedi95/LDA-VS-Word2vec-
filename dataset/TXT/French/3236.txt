1cGyzWtfOoDiE8V0OR85yA I absolutely LOVE this place.  Whether you are visiting or live in Pittsburgh, you MUST check this place out.  Like others said, CASH ONLY, so be sure to bring some.  Their crepes are out of this world.  Their sweet crepes are very rich, so my best advice is to get both a sweet and a savory crepe and split with a friend.  My fave sweet crepe is the Black Forest and my fave savory crepe is the egg and sausage...SO good!  I can't speak to the coffee...but if you really need to get your coffee fix, go to Starbucks a block down!
