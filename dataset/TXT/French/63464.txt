t_1myTZfYeEQ07Jr8JEF5Q I'm a foodie that can eat.  This is the first place that actually got my stomach to Yell for Help!  Food was way too Fatty!  I've heard that this is the place for having a heart attack but I wasn't expecting it to actually do so.  It was so Fatty that after the first 4 servings, I could actually not taste the food in front of my anymore.  It was way too overpriced for what  you got, sorry!  It's an experience but one to be repeated. They not only overcharge but charge people for empty seating (seats reserved but not filled out).
