a little house tucked in from the hustle of the yonge and york mills interesection. the moment you reach the gorgeous white double french doors, you feel special walking into a countryside home with BEAUTIFUL Ambiance.  It's as romantic as it gets!
The newly renovated decor truly lives up to the "auberge" name (french for 'inn').

Glorious service that spoils you to no end beginning with their sweet hosts and knowledgeable servers.  My friend was a vegetarian and they catered to her needs with zest.  
The food was intricate, beautiful, and delicately balanced, and every bite was a big bang and wow in your mouth.  Each dish was full of bold and big flavoured organic ingredients. 

at one point our server recommended a spruce birch non alcoholic beer, and we tried it and i am still dreaming about it -- it was amazing.

YUM YUM YUM

to the passion fruit granita,

and the amazingly sauted kimpachi --
