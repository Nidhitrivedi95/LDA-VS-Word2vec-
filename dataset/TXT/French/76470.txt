Yp9w4nhUowBU_IS_StFXbQ Everything was perfect from the service to the food to the ambiance. Elegant and relaxing at the same time. I had the traditional breakfast with eggs, bacon, English muffin, and bread basket. The basket included a melt in your mouth chocolate croissant, blueberry muffin, and apple turnover. All in perfect sizes. Everything was cooked perfectly and presented with class. I will go here every trip!
