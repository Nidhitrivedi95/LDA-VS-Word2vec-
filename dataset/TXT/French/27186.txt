dd3GZs6zW2t7BM0cbxAzvg My girlfriend and I were celebrating our anniversary and since we want to but can't go to paris I chose French cuisine, which was a first for both of us.

I found La Palette through yelp's great reviews, and we were not disappointed. Service was excellent right from the moment I called to make reservations. We weren't daring enough to try escargot, so for appetizers we had the calamari dish. It was great. For entree we had Cassoulet/Steak Frites. AMAZING is an understatement. And to top it off we had the 3 creme brulee tasters. I'm definitely coming back some day. I can't express how great our anniversary ended up. Thanks La Palette.
