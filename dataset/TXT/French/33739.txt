hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA My friend really, really loved their coffee. 
My friends also thought their sandwiches were good. 
I was disappointed with the vegan sandwich. It was boring, flavorless and more bread than anything.
This place is probably wonderful if you're looking for some really legit, high quality coffee, but if you're vegan- maybe try the other awesome vegan restaurants out there.
