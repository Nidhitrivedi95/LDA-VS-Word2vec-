5EIuCcoHY2evAhFMBV6G6g This is one of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas.  It's located in the Venetian Hotel.  It's a French Cuisine that's why I love it so much.

Here are my favorite dishes:

1) Foie Gras with scallop (YUM!!! but I think they discontinued.... I might ask them again next time when I go)

2) Escargots!! super YUM!!
3) Seafood Pasta

I really like this place not just because of their food, but their services and I never have to make a reservation and I don't have to dress up to go in.
