rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A OMY disappointing! I swear joel robuchon better be WAY BETTER THAN THIS! I had dinner here last week... i had 2 shirley temples..
as for apps, i had the  $50 5 oz pate style foie gras = NO BUENO... What i really didnt understand was the extra sea salt that accompanied my foie gras... I didnt need anymore salt on my foie gras... that duck liver was uber salty... i must say this was the WORST foie gras ive ever had! If you guys want good foie gras head over to the palazo... hands down it's WAY better there

On with the entree....I think i  had their beef short ribs, it was a special!  Man it was dry...and i had better beef short ribs for half the price... also, my veggies were again,HELLLA salty.... whoever was working that sautee line  got salt happy! Even if someone were to invite me here, thanks but no thanks.. im never gonna pay $120 for myself here again!
