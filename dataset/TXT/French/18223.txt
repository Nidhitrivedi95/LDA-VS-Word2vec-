A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g Have been here 2x and it won't be my last.
First time to pick up some pastries to take to a friends house-delish.
2nd time-breakfast with Dad-I had the Croque Monsier-awesome! Gooey cheesy!
Dad has the typical eggs & toast w/ham.
Very good and since you eat on front of the counter of goods-you are staring at everything else you want to try and leave knowing you just have to come back for more!
