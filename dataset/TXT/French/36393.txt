The highlight was my pork sandwich. I wasn't expecting anything particularly special but it's not an exaggeration to say that it was one of the most delicious dishes I've had anywhere at any price. My wife got the vegetarian pho, which was also really good and (according to the waitress) vegan, since it was made with vegetable broth (unusual for pho).

We got two appetizers, the Zen Spring Rolls and the edamame.  The Spring Rolls were fresh tasting and came with tasty peanut dipping sauce.  The edamame was coated in a delicious sauce and came in a generous portion.

Incidentally, the reason I ended up getting a sandwich is that the lunch menu is pretty limited. Most of the entrees are served only for dinner. You may want to keep that in mind.
