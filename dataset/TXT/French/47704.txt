O3OH5IEFMPtz7mPKakPZ3Q This was my second visit and it was exceptional. I came in around 2ish am and thought for sure they would be closed but luckily they weren't and were very friendly and welcoming. I came for the bone marrow which I loved the previous time and it awesome. I had the scallops in ponzu sauce and the truffle edamame. I almost want to revisit before I leave!
