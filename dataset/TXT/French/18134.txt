A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g I haven't actually been to this bakery myself, but my girl stops by every so often to get me some macarons. I never knew I liked these little cookies until trying them in Paris and my life has never been the same again. I like just about every flavor they make, with chocolate pistachio being my favorite. Every time she brings a little box home we finish the entire thing before the next morning. They're just so addictive.
