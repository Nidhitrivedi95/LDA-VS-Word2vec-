htQgj-ANQpZGpIpkkrEmyQ Wanted to check out a new place for a late brunch and this place did not disappoint.  We ordered the Chicken & Waffle with egg, Korean Beef Sandwich, and the INSP burger with cheese. 

Chicken & Waffle came with a nice crispy waffle with a generous portion of 3 juicy, crispy large chicken pieces (3 whole boneless thighs?), ginger maple syrup, spicy berry compote (could not taste the spice at all but nice nonetheless and not overly sweet), and a fried egg.  I really enjoyed this dish but it felt like something was missing... maybe a little kick in the fried chicken or maybe a little thick gravy to contrast further with the sweet and salty - I'm not sure but I would still recommend that you try this though... the amount of juicy protein in this dish is incredible! 

INSP burger - prime beef, seared pork belly, fried egg, & tomato mayo.  I had a bite of this and the prime beef was perfectly cooked and well seasoned; the pork belly had a nice sear without being dry and the tomato mayo was nice.  Decent size with fries on the size. Another dish where a little kick (maybe deep fried jalapeños?) would be welcome but still great on its own.  This was the first to disappear from our table - it was fully inhaled within minutes! 

the Korean - prime rib steak and pickled cucumber on a french baguette with duck confit fries... The duck confit fries was a decent size (small bowl worth) and the French baguette was reasonable even though my companion kept raving about how good it was to where they wanted to order seconds but was too full to move. 

For dessert, we had the Sweet Toffee Pudding with oreo topping (silky and creamy; not overly sweet, with the oreo crumbs adding texture) and the Capt'n Crunch banana bread... not overly sweet; I don't know what I was expecting but it was pretty good... come check it out!
