rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Never been one to like French food but the home-made pasta I had was so rich and delicious. And the wine selection was great. I went for a friends birthday and they brought out a lemon tart cake for her which was also delicious.  The venue was nice and it's located in the Venetian (one of my favorite hotels in Vegas!)
