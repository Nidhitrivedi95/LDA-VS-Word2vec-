SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA This place is very unique. The restaurant is actually a remodeled first floor of a house. There is also patio outside, which is great in summer. As I walked into the restaurant, I smelled the reason of living..

I ordered escargot and duck confit and my boyfriend ordered chicken liver and veal. I would say their food was a little on the salty side - especially the escargot and the cabbage in the duck dish i ordered. They were also very generous in the portion, especially the chicken liver. It was so much that we were afraid that we were going to get vitamin A intoxication! LOL Overall, it was a pleasant experience.
