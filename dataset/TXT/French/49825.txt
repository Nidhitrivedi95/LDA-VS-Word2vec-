oS96aJIHFWcFAlGHKKXjaw One bite of these delicate, buttery, delicious pastries and I was transported to the heart of Paris. I kid you not. The pain au chocolate, the croissant almondine, the macaron... All so very delicate... All so very sweet... All so very, very French. 

I'm told the owner/baker is himself from France. A transplant to Pittsburgh who made the genius decision to open an amazing, authentic little French bakery in the neighborhood that would most appreciate it. 

The cakes are exquisite. The pastries are gorgeous. They have savory croissant (which I haven't seen anywhere outside of Europe!) and they have lovely little baguete sandwiches. Everything and anything your heart could desire, they have something for you. They do. 

The shop is small, with a few cafe tables and wall art that pays homage to the homeland. When we arrived, there was a line nearly out the door but everyone politely waited for their petit pastries while oogling the other beauties in the case. 

If you find yourself in Pittsburgh, do yourself a favor and make a trip to Lawrenceville if for no other reason than to taste the confectionary treasures from La Gourmandine. It's a helluva lot cheaper than going to Paris, and tastes just as good, I swear.
