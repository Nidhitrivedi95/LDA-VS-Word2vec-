p2OvNFiFKnRoWSRON4-lcA The food is delicious and brings me back home! It's always a pleasure to go to the Bistro, the food is authentic, I know what I'm talking about cause I'm French. And as a bonus I can speak french with the owner... even met his wife who's from my hometown! Service is great, the waitress is very nice.
My husband took me for my birthday, to make me feel less homesick, and it worked. We like to go on special occasions. 
Place is wonderful, prices are very fair and the food, oh the food, you have to try it at least once. The menu as a little bit of everything.
PS: les paupiettes de veaux sont delicieuses. Cela faisait des annees que je n'en avait pas mange d'aussi bonnes.
