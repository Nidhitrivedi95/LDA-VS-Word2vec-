2gUbgbdJ7IFSbicBXlSchw On our way home from Quebec City, we made a quick stop in Montreal for lunch, (boy do I live the life). Great location near fun shops and other eateries. Sat at the bar. Not the best service, I felt slightly ignored the entire time. 
Ordered a beer- Griffintown Montréalaise- which was light but good. Got nice bread to start and a huge jar of gherkins- too bad I dont really like them! I had the sauteed duck confit with salad for lunch-- which was fresh, delicious and huge. Lots of delicious veggies, and TONS of perfectly cooked and seasoned duck. Best salad EVER (makes up for the poor service). My friend has the beer tartare.. which was also a HUGE portion, and she said it wasnt her fave, but definitely was good. It's pretty expensive here, and the place was full for a random Wednesday afternoon. Not sure I'd come back, but had a great, filling lunch!
