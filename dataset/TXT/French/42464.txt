LdD0yYLcHuamULrvZYY3Jg Great little neighborhood gem; our party of 5 dropped in at 9pm, Sunday on the last night of our weekend away in Montreal, and despite that it seemed they would not be expecting any additional parties that night (and I believe they were a bit understaffed for the night but completely made up for it in hustle), they were able to seat us and we were so thankful they could. The food was exceptional and by far the best meal we had all weekend. BYOB balances the economics of the meal, taking the edge off of the splurge. I ordered the foie gras first and the rabbit main, and I'd go back in a heartbeat for them both. Pay close attention to the menu, the prices aren't as bad as they seem - they are all prix fixe.
