XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q I struggled with what rating to give this place.

The food was among the best that I've had anywhere and certainly the best in Las Vegas, and that's saying something, with the long list of great restaurants in the city.  The langoustine ravioli was a dish I will remember 5 years from now.  The bread cart had some of the best bread on it I've ever had.  The ambiance was so beautiful that I couldn't believe I was inside the MGM-Grand.  The service was as good as I've had.

But oh, the price.  Don't get me wrong - I've eaten at a lot of very expensive, very nice restaurants in my time, but this is in a different league for pricing.  The tasting menu there, at almost $400 is twice what some of the best restaurants in the world charge.  Is it worth twice what Alinea, Eleven Madison Park, Per Se and El Celler de Can Roca charge for their food?

I don't think so, hence the 4 star rating.

If you are a whale and have an unbelievable comp balance come here.  If you are foodie, you have to do JR at least once.  But I couldn't see coming here with any regularity.
