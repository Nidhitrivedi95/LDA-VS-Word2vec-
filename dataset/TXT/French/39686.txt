K-b7obYsM_meX_GAd7rJTw Ive been here on a few occassions because friends were there or i had a gift certificate. sadly enough it didnt live up to the hype. my first visit the male waitor in an empty restaraunt was down right rude! He made me feel uncomfortable for not ordering n entree when there were lunch specials. he critisized me for the beer i ordered. and was rude when i asked for ketchup. my second trip there was much better nice waitress.. good lunch. my last trip was horrible.again the only patron.. the waitress was new and had no clue to wines they carried by the glass.. never a refill of water... soup was watery with no flavor... and the fish was horrific. it smelled like feces. i felt bad complainin since i was only one there. i paid bill left waitress tip and wrote a letter email suggesting they check the fish something was off with it. and they never even responded. needles to say ill never go back. terribly dissapointed
