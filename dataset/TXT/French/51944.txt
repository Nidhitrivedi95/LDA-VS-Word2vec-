There were 4 of us on a Travelzoo prix fixe.  Everyone ordered something different from each course - but first we ordered the Foie Gras.  I had a different Foie at their sister restaurant Alize before, and this one was equally impressive.  These are two of the best foie dishes i've ever enjoyed - like candy for grown ups.  Every course was delivered thoughtfully, on time and we all shared tastes around the table so it was like getting a dozen courses instead of just 3+.  The highlight was retiring upstairs to their separate lounge area and enjoying a very nice appertif.  Don't miss going upstairs after your meal if it's open!  Old school elegance & service meets modern capability at Andre's, I would say.  Bon app
