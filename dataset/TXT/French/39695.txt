K1Y1cQT6KuWOfAoDbDIh_g This little gem was recommended to us by the hotel concierge and I had to go thank her afterwards. The food was very good, while it cost around $40 it included an appetizer and a desert. I had escargot puff pastry, Surf and Turf and a chocolate mousse and it was all amazing. I picked at my friends' combo plate (foie gras, filet, lamb chops and duck breast), rabbit dish and veal dish and they were all great. Service was very good, if a bit stuffy. 
My only qualm was that outdoor seating faces a kinda creepy looking empty lot.
