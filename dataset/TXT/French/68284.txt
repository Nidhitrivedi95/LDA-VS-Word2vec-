vg55SAkrEmuHpWfIMtJjBQ After eating here only once, Legume is now in the top of my favorite Pittsburgh restaurants list.  Consistent with what's already been said, this place is amazing! We tried several of their pates, each with a distinctive flavor-some smokey, some  savory-all delicious.  We next tried the grilled escarole salad- one of the best things I've ever eaten- the combo between the bitter escarole, salty parmesan, sweet cherry tomato, and crispy bacon was heavenly.  I had the sausage with polenta and escarole (you can tell, I love escarole).  The home made sausage was delicious, but the star of the plate, for me at least, was the polenta.  Creamy and caramelized on the outside, this was perhaps the best polenta I've ever had.  We finished wth the pear tart, which was also good, but I would leave more room for the savory dishes!  Their cocktails are fabulous, I've heard, but we stuck with wine to pair with dinner-  their wine list was phenomenal, and clearly chosen to pair well with the food for the day.   As their menu changes daily, I know I'll be back very soon...
