A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g For my 200th review, I would like to highlight my French heritage!

Since I had reason to trek to Boca Park, I decided I better listen to my yelpfriends and check this patisserie out!  Little did I know that it would be hard to find, and that I would do several u-turns on Charleston until I gave up and called, then learned where to find this gem - behind Roy's in the center back from the street.

If people had more macarons, they would think French people are nicer.  Frenchies get a bad rep.  The lady helping me had moved to Vegas from Paris just 3 months prior, and her English is very good.  I saw things I would eat in one of those virtual reality machines - napoleons, croissants, tarts....and was certainly impressed with the sheer size of the place - it was huge in the back and served savory goods too!

Yet the mission was for macarons, and I could not believe the endless flavors and colors available.  Miss Parisienne seemed amused that I did not want chocolate or peanut butter, but I got lemon and vanilla for myself, and a blueberry for the boy.  I told her that my mom and grandma are also Parisienne, that I got screwed as a child and was not taught French because it is their secret language, and shared with her the names of my uncles - all very French, though they grew up in Omaha.

Needless to say, when I got to my car, I ate the lemon one, and some of me went to pastry-heaven, so I ate the vanilla one.  I traveled carefully back to the SE side so Eric could have a little taste of France too, and he definitely was pleased with the results.

I sent a picture to my Frenchie mom, and even though she could make them and definitely find them in her city, she wants me to bring some of Manon's when I visit next.  Trust me, they will be eaten by me before they get anywhere else!  Bon apetit!
