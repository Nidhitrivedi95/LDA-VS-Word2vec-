5EIuCcoHY2evAhFMBV6G6g Visited Pinot Brasserie for a birthday dinner and it was GREAT! 


 My boyfriend and i had a later reservation 930pm (restaurant closes at 10pm)... and we were a bit nervous that we would be rushed. To our surprise, we were not rushed at all, and  were able to enjoy a delightful dinner in the front room.

The restaurant has a rather extensive wine list - moderately priced. We enjoyed a bottle of Pinot Grigio. 

We started off our meal with a caprese salad, field greens and crab claw cocktail.  The caprese salad was amazing. I love caprese salads and it was the best mozzerella cheese that I have ever had. The tomato was poached whole in a white balsamic dressing. My boyfriend had the field greens with carmelized pears, pecans and a not too sweet dressing.  The crab claw cocktail was served with a not too spicy, fresh cocktail sauce. The crab claws were large and very meaty.

For our entrees we got the ribeye steak and lobster tail. For $45 my boyfriend said that his ribeye was cooked to perfection. My lobster tail came deshelled and cooked perfectly as well.  Both portions were larger than other restaurants. 

Our meals ended with a great chocolate souffle cake with a great sauce. Definitely try the chocolate souffle if you are here! 

Service was absolutely great- as mentioned above, we were one of the last tables at the restaurant, but our server didn't rush us at all.  Our bus boy was very attentive with our water, plates, bread. Over all had a great dinner experience.

I will definitely be back again!
