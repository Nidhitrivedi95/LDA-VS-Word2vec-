FRuuIDOd21pTJHvEGIt1Gg Went here on a Monday evening, it was very busy but the service was very attentive and the food was very good. My companion had the daily fish special - it was hake and was well prepared and a very nice looking plate. 

I had the hanger steak which was cooked to my liking. The salad is very good sized and very fresh greens. 

Try the chocolate truffles, they were divine.
