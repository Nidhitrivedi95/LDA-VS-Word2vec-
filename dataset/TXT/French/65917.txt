udFcIcbWbxrO8uLF95WnQg Came here after a Sunday 630 performance of BOM.

Where to go on a Sunday night, after the theater, in downtown Cleveland?  We walked by at about 915, and the sign said they closed at 8, but there were folks, lots of folks, still eating.  So we popped our heads in and they said "come-on-in!"  So we did.

They are trying to build up their theater trade and were more than hospitable.  They had a special theater small plate menu, and of course a full bar.  The menu was varied enough; so there was something for each of our four top.  We had eight dishes, 4 drinks, and left about 10:30.  

Great environment, attentive servers and management.  We left satisfied and happy.

Wish them luck on catering to the theater by making a visit!
