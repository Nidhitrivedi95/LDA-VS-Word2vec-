rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I had dinner here based on the recommendation of a fellow Bay Area diner and was able to get reservations for an early dinner on short notice.  

The bread was deliciously crusty!

The wine list was extensive in the varietals despite having limited options.  I started with a glass of champagne and  ordered a carafe of Cabernet Franc that was amazing on the palate.  

We feasted on the goat cheese salad, short ribs, leg of lamb, and finished with the profiteroles.
