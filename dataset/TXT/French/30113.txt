fRu_POqPowUo6nHSRMjOPw Came to this restaurant on a Monday with a group of 5 friends. We were able to get a reservation quickly and without trouble via OpenTable (even got bonus points). When we arrived the restaurant was mostly empty. It feels like a high end restaurant so not a bad place for a date as the tables have candles and there a nice ambient atmosphere. The menu is pretty simplistic with prices for entrees ranging from 18 to 30. While the cocktails were priced around 15, there is a happy hour special until 7 for beer ($5) and wine ($8). Service at the restaurant was great, and our food came our within a reasonable amount of time. My friends got beef burgers which they enjoyed and I got the brick chicken which comes with the side of a salad and macaroni and cheese. Overall the food was decent, and I would come back to this place again if I'm in a bind for a quick and easy reservation in the financial district.
