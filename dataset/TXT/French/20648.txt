AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw I was fortunate to get a chance to taste Payard's macarons again and this time, it was very delicious. The texture was as I like, delicately crispy on the outside but soft inside, flavors were deep and rich and not overpowered by sugar nor almond paste. My personal favorite was Passion Fruit and Rasberry Lychee, exotic and delicate!
