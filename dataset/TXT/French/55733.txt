rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Hmmmm, I really wanted to love this place. It was either I came at the wrong time or the food was just really a-ok. I guess I don't read.. but I went during the weekday aka no succulent chicken and waffles. I was a bit bummed, didn't want to run out of the place when we're already seated al fresco, feeling like we're in France. So I gave it a try.

We ordered the :
Croque Madame - Really really good. That Mornay sauce with the fried egg, yum!
Moules au Fenouil- Sadly a bit gritty.. However the sauce was lovely.
Truite Amandine - This was just so-so to me, the trout was cooked perfectly. Very light

Service was slow, can't find any runners or waiters around from time to time. Overall, I was a bit disappointed, but I won't give up! i'll come for Sunday Brunch and see how that is.
