Cavecreek isn't exactly a culinary destination but Cafe Bink is a step above the rest.  Set into "downtown" Cavecreek (really just a quaint strip mall...but don't let that dissuade you), Cafe Binks has a premier setting in front of Black mountain and sunsets are just unreal while sitting on the patio.  The food is fantastic and the beer list is suprisingly delicious as well with breweries such as Dogfish Head.  The food is very much like homecooked, only if mom switched up the bacon for pork belly and manwiches for the best damn meat loaf EVER!  Coupled with the views and the comfortable desert evening temps, this place is phenomenal.  

Sure you can go to the original Binkley's down the street if you want a little more well to do atmosphere, but for a casual meal and drink Cafe Bink is it.  Tell all your friends that the best meal you've had in a while was at a strip mall.
