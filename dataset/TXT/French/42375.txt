Don't know if they have a speaker system set up yet, or if they have plans to, but it was eerily silent in there. I think it would feel a little more cozy if there was some light background music, so you could have conversations with friends without feeling like everyone can hear you. 

I just got a couple of pastries, the pate chaud (one chicken, one pork), and a cheese danish with jam(with strawberry?, raspberry?, not sure). The pastry was nice and flaky, the meat in the pate chaud was flavorful, and it wasn't greasy like Lee's Sandwiches. The Vietnamese coffee was good, but nothing amazing. I'm wanna come back to try out the almond croissant.
