The owner takes care of this place really well.  We chatted with her a bit when she came to check on us, and she told us her that friends always said to her how come she kept cleaning and wiping the place all the time.  Tables, the way they put all the chairs, and of course both bathrooms, everything was kept organized and clean.  Although this place isn't that big, their layout is spacious for all customers and the high ceiling is adding extra to the comfortable feeling.
We are certainly coming back during our stay in Las Vegas.
