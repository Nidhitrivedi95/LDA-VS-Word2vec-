rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Wanted to come here after the great reviews on yelp. Came for breakfast

The french toast was AMAZING. My husband absolutely adored it!

I ordered eggs which came with bread and spinach. The spinach was really not to my taste, I didn't like that it was bitter. 

The scrambled eggs were cooked great, not burnt and just the good amount of butter. Potatoes were good though

I think Id come back here for the French Toast. I thought it was totally worth it for that. The rest werent that great
