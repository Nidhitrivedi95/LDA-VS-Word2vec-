uP3H5bcsiTXM0k0xQhRndg The best food I have ever eaten. I was waiting out in the cold for 2 hours with my friend who was steaming mad that I made him wait with me. But when he tasted the onion soup he said "that's the best soup I've ever had".

We had the ultimate experience and  the mac and cheese (cream based). I put some homemade hot sauce on my mac and cheese and actually saw fireworks. It was that good. Kinda pricey but worth it. Also the food is very rich in cream and butter. The quantity might not look like much, but it's so rich that it feels you up.
