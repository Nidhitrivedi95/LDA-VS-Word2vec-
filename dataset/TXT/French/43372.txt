LtDYRcMJbJPhXPEklT29Fw Where cuisine meets compassion.....this restaurant does not miss on either. We were dining with a large group who had bought out the restaurant. For a fixed menu there was a large selection of ambitious starters and main courses from escargot and omelette to lamb chops, duck l'orengerie, to grouper in potatoes. All delicious and beautifully presented. The service is attentive, disciplined, and sincere while maintaining a professional attitude.
Best of luck Brandon you and your staff are an inspiration for the human nutrition we need both body and soul.
