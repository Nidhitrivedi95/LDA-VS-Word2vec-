This was by far the best dinner we had in Vegas.  We booked a table well in advance and the manager seated us himself at a romantic table for 2 overlooking the Bellagio Fountains.  It was the most romantic spot in the entire city.  The service was truly professional.  They kept the wine flowing and anticipated every need we could have.  The food was incredible.  I got the duck and my husband got whitefish, neither disappointed.
We were worried this place would be all hype because of the location, but it deserves every good review.  Worth eating here at least once.
