kGOr_D-LNpgZ2M9N8TT4QQ I had brunch here twice whilst visiting Toronto. I was very impressed with the decor inside -- definitely one of the more beautiful spots I had been to. The price definitely matched the ambience of the place -- expect to be shelling out (not too crazy though!) for some of their food! The crowd is very courteous and it isn't a loud spot by any means.

Their service was very professional and kind. Knowledgable about their selection. Great staff. 

Food was amazing- oysters and roast lamb sandwiches were supreme delicious.

I had a great time here on brunch for both occasions. I would definitely recommend this spot for that.
