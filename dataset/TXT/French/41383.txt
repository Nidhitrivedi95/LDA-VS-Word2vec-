kGOr_D-LNpgZ2M9N8TT4QQ Sad to say this but I have to downgrade my star rating for this place. 

I came here with some friends who were visiting Toronto and I chose to come here because of the good experience I had last time (last review).  

First, I made a reservation as it was Father's Day but I still had to wait over 30 minutes to get a seat.  Really?  That shouldn't happen with a reservation even if it was Father's Day.  

Second, I reordered the smoked salmon eggs benedict because I enjoyed it so much last time but it was much, much smaller than I remembered.  In my previous review, I wrote how it came with a salad and delicious potatoes but the plate that I got this time had 1 measly piece of bread with 2 poached eggs atop with hollandaise sauce and then a few potatoes on the side.  What?  Really?  They couldn't give me two pieces of bread for my two eggs? What happened? And for the same price too? I wasn't even full.  

I was and still am SO disappointed. And so were my friends.  Sorry La Societe, I don't know what happened to your dishes but I certainly can't recommend you anymore.
