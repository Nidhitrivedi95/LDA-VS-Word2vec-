rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A My Daughter and I always stop at Bouchon when we visit Vegas! They have amazing pastries and corned beef hash is delicious. It has a very classy atmopshere tucked up in the Venetian. The service was impeccable. I also love the hibiscus mimosa, just perfect for a brunch drink.
