QeFsIMcIFIJcOrpthYL8jg We went with high expectations and were sorely disappointed
For me , a culinary infraction in a highly touted restaurant can be overlooked if at least the service is acceptable which was not the case here
To think that they would mess up a simple dish like steamed mussels and frites is remarkable
It was poorly prepared , dry , and cold cos the waiter forgot about it
The last straw was that the waiter never once asked how the meal was, quietly came around with his card swiping machine , picked up the tip and went off and we like idiots actually tipped for this abismal meal

Avoid this place there are a ton of amazing restaurants in Montreal
