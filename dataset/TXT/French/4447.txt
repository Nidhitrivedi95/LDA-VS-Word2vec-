2gUbgbdJ7IFSbicBXlSchw Classic French bistro, you get a sense of how people have been dining for decades and decades. 
We didn't make a reservation so they sat us at the bar, the servers move like an art form, weaving by each other, their fingers cleaning the glassware like playing piano.

Foie gras terrine - served with apple jelly, amazing balance of sweet and savory.
Bone marrow - three pieces cut width wise, delicious no matter what - but might be a bit hard to get to even with the tiny spoons. Self serve salt. 
Shrimp risotto - the risotto to die for. Perfectly cooked and the shrimp is done just right.
Beef tartar - very good and not skimpy on the capers. It's a bit spicy for those who cannot handle horse radish kind of spiciness and the salad that comes with it is good as well. 
Beef ravioli - The sauce was very delicious, we used the extra bread to soak up the remaining sauces. Wish there was more - there were only 5 ravioli! 

Dessert wise - the meringue dome is impressive but it's rather big and if I were to come back I would skip this one. 

Everything was a knockout, thank you L'express! Merci
