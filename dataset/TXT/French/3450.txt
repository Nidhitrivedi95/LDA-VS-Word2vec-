1idRJwqXxxmgSyQRKag4KQ Go! Seriously! These guys have worked hard for nearly 2 years fighting city hall to get this place open and it is fantastic.

The staff are friendly, obliging, helpful, etc. The chef is also the owner, J.P Challet, and his partner is running the front room. Ask them anything about the menu, they'll help you.

Food is delicious, good wine list. 
It's a small small room, and we went during the first week when no one knew it was open. Apparently now it's tough to get reservations. They do have bench seats looking out the window, and we had the one facing Harbord. This was a good seat, as we watched the world go by while dining on delicious French cuisine.

As we were finishing up, we could smell bacon. MMMM, They make bacon scones for Sam James coffee shop across the street. Another reason to love Harbord Street.

So, what are you waiting for? Call and make a reservation.
