rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Once we found Bouchon, (it was not easy to get to from inside the Casino) I was taken aback with the understated decor.  It felt a little on the cold side but the food made up for it.  
Beignets de Brandade de Morue was delicious and so was the Puree of Sunchoke Soup. I ordered the fries because Anthony Bourdain raved about them on his show, but I was not overly impressed with them.
Service was friendly but got a little too busy as to make it slightly inconvenient.
