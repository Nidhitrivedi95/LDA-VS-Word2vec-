4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I was in town for a conference when a friend of mine said he wanted to have French food for dinner. Considering I don't know much about French food I figured it'd be safe to start my search at Paris Hotel & Casino. The reviews for this place were very good and I can say that I was definitely a fan of the food. My steak was perfectly cooked and it tasted wonderful. The view was a nice bonus as well. We sat on the patio which has a wonderful view of the strip and the fountain show at Bellagio. It definitely makes for a nice place for dinner, and though it's pricey, it doesn't cost an arm and a leg. Service could have been better, but I had a nice experience either way and would definitely go back.
