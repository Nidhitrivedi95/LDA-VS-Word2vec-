o9PN5VhdfH7RViCBejG5sw Upon reading this, you must know that I actually visited Nuances in September of 2008, but didn't realize that yelp was available for Candadian restaurants until just now.  

When I went, I was blown away.  The food was amazing, and the service was impeccable.  I had the 5 course Chef's tasting menu and each course was shear perfection.  The first course was a white lobster gazpacho with asparagus, second was duck foie gras, third was beef tenderloin, fourth was a beautifully cooked rack of lamb, and finally, a wonderul berry, ice cream desser with raspberry sauce.  All courses came with a unique and delightful wine pairing.

After almost 2 years, you might wonder how I still remember this and what each course was.  It's a really simple answer...it was seriously that good.
