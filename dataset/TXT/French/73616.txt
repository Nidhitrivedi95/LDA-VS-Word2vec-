xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g What an amazing experience right dab middle in the heart of the Las Vegas strip!  This has been on our bucket list for the past several years and we finally made the splurge for our anniversary.  Overlooking all of the bright lights of the Las Vegas strip, you get to enjoy some real fine dining that the Paris has to offer.

We had two of our dear friends join us for dinner who also happen to be very good business colleagues.  Visiting us all the way from Pittsburgh we wanted to show them a great time.  This place did not disappoint.  From the minute we sat down, we were greeted with a really nice and comfortable red velvet booth overlooking the strip.  We ordered drinks, which were very excellent by the way; the Pink Velvet and Can Can.  Definitely a sweet and sour type of alcoholic drink made to perfection.  My only gripe was that the drink was served in a champagne glass instead of a larger cocktail type glass.  Still a good drink to definitely start the buzz for the night.

Our entrees consisted of the Free Range Chicken and the Imperial Beef Wellington.  Both excellent meals and I did not leave the plate empty at all.  I told the server I was concerned with the beef wellingtons having some pink, but it did not.  Was served medium well and certainly did not disappoint.  It also came with a red blood looking sauce (I forgot the name), but it really enhanced all of the savory flavors.  I will definitely be coming back here to try the multi-course meal; apparently all parties in the group must order it.  Great excuse to come back.  Excellent place for cozy, quiet and romantic evenings.  Be prepared to spend $125-$150 per person, but well worth it.
