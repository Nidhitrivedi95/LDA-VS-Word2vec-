HHvO4MgBFabsmlInou6viQ Le Baratin is a very good option for a pleasant French meal.

I found my meal and service to be very good with some room for improvement in both areas.

The great delight and surprise was a $24 Sunday night prix fixe that included a choice of soup or salad, a main, and a chocolate truffle at the end of the meal.

The mushroom soup was good, yet could have
had a bit more of a creamy texture. For my main I had steak frites. The sauce on the steak was excellent, as were the frites. The steak was good, and could have been better. The plate came with a small salad as well.

The chocolate truffle for dessert was delicious.

Cocktails were boozy, yet well-made. The wine list featured very reasonably-priced wines.

Service was good, yet you could feel the hectic pace. Small things like removing a plate from the table before both guests are finished, etc. were noticeable, yet not deal-breakers.

I really enjoyed the meal. I wish they would charge $29 and offer a more complete dessert, yet no complaints with a 24$ prix fixe.
