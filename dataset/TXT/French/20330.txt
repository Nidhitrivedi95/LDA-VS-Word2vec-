AVLKTVoB43D3sVBtSxsz_Q Hidden inside the gorgeous Le Crystal Hotel and Spa is a gem of restaurant called La Coupole. I would recommend their Table d'hote which is three course menu at a set price with great selections and variations. They have wonderful terrace and if you have lunch around 1 pm, it is not as crowded and service is actually decent. Great little spot for business lunch.
