O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q I feel that Morels has not recieved its full recognition yet. The restaraunt was not very full eventhough our reservations were for 8:00pm. Maybe everyone wouldnt guess that a non- celebrity chef restaraunt such as Morels, could be any better or meet a celebrities chef's standard, but what is their lost is completely my gain! =).  The service is most definitely top notch, there was a 3-1 ratio for each table. Ive been to alot of more expensive restaraunts, and this by far beats all those snooty high- end uncomfortable restaraunts, The food was excellent, for appetizors we had the beef tarter, dozen oysters and a variety of cheeses. Me and my bf both chose the steaks; a wet aged and dry aged and they were both melt in your mouths, wonderful!..

We didnt have room for dessert, but next time I'll try to not eat as much and see what their dessert menu has to offer. I will be coming back here on my next trip to Vegas, you can bet on it! =0
