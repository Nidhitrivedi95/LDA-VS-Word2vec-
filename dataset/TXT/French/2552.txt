0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g My experience at Picasso was truly a let down. Came here with a group of 7 and everyone had at least one complaint about either their appetizer or entree. 

I had never had such bad and disappointing service at a Michelin star restaurant. Our host was inattentive and barely cordial, but rather aloof and unamused. Our servers seemed unprofessional. We literally had to wave them down for everything. I've had better service at an Applebee's.

The only dishes I would recommend here would be the sea bass, poached oysters, and main lobster salad.

Sorry Picasso, but I'm more of a Monet girl.
