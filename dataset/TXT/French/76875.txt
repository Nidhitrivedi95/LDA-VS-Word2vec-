ysJo5Jdo29XOBCnKrbUKWg I went for Sunday brunch. The atmosphere was like a quaint corner of Paris, the staff was friendly, and the food was great! And the bistro itself just smelled delicious with all the other plates being prepared.

Get some macarons boxed to go as well... amazing authentic French macarons!
