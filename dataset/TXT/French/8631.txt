4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw One of the best restaurants in Vegas for the price. Always reasonably priced and delicious. I always get the baked goat cheese for an appetizer. So good and the waiter brought us extra garlic bread for it. I ordered the seafood platter to share which came with a whole lobster, prawns, oysters, salmon, and a seaweed salad all for $50. Talk about a deal! We sat on the patio which was great because we were able to see the fountains at the Bellagio. It was also heated so you don't have to worry about being cold. We were about to order dessert when we realized we were running late for a show. We had already ordered cappucinos so we asked our waiter if her could make them to-go. He put our drinks in to-go cups and brought us our checks very quickly. I always enjoy coming here for the great food, nice atmosphere, and reasonable prices.
