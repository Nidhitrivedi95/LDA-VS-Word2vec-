c8j5MQqlb0RhgS_bpxMDuA Dined at Boris bistro with two kids in tow. It was about 7 pm and we were famished. The maître d explained to us quite nicely that if we were going to eat at the restáurant, then we had to be out by 8 pm due to their liquor license. Since we were tired and hungry, we said that an hour was enough. They seated us in their beautiful garden patio and our waitress, without rushing us, took our orders. She got our orders of duck risotto, grilled lamb and tagliatelle out fast. The food was simply amazing and the service was fantastic! The duck risotto, in particular, was so good that it might have ruined other risottos for me. This bistro certainly beats the fine dining restaurant we were at the other night, in terms of food and service. I highly recommend this restaurant!
