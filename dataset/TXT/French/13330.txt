4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I had the Eggs Benedict and the wife had the plain french toast with a side of bacon. The ambiance is amazing. You're in a sophisticated French restaurant but immersed in the Vegas feel, especially when you dine in the outdoor area. You have a beautiful view of the Bellagio and if you dine after 4:30 you have an awesome view of the Bellagio water show, just amazing.

Our server was attentive and very nice; glad to know professional customer service is important. Even if the meal was mediocre...and it wasn't, we would go back for the level of attention to detail.
