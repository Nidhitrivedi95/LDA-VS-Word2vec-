YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g A group of us decided to dine at the bar vs getting a table.  The restaurant sits in an open area of the Mandalay Bay, so expect a loud environment towards the front of the place.  Being that this is Hubert Keller's spot, expect to pay for the food you get, if you're on a budget, don't bother walking in here (nor any other restaurant in a big label casino in Las Vegas).  Regardless, I went with the ahi tuna tacos and the wagyu burger.  The tacos had some issues to me as the shell was thick and I just lost everything else inside.  The slice of ahi was thicker than I had thought, which was a nice surprise.  But unfortunately the overall taco was not that great.  There was a longer gap before the entrees came out, but it didn't stop me from really enjoying the wagyu burger.  The patty itself was delicious and cooked to a perfect medium.  You can really tell a good patty apart by the consistency of the meat and Fleur hit it right on.  The potatoes on the side were a nice complement.  Not sure if I'd come back here, but it was a nice dining experience.  Prices are a tad high for what they serve, but again, it's Hubert Keller's restaurant in one of Vegas' nicer hotels.
