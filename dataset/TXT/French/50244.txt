ovtlrcsVRlgZZQUlHs_ovw I was pleasantly surprised when I walked into the Vogue Bistro last night. I was expecting something cookie cutter, but this place definitely was not. The Vogue burger was delicious. My husband and I brought out of town guests and they thoroughly enjoyed themselves. Great atmosphere and martini selection. Will be back for sure!
