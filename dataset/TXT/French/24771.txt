COgwFthJpS4We16W5Gf4lw Went to Pamplemousse early on a Friday night and were were the only ones there for at least an hour -- I suppose Vegas regulars like to dine later. The ambiance is very old school--lush colors with dimmed lighting--and I felt like I had stepped back to Vegas in the 60s. I could picture Bobby Darin himself sitting at a corner table. We were treated to an entertaining history of the restaurant as told by the head waiter, an eloquent and affable chap who fit the atmosphere perfectly.

The food wasn't oh-my-god spectacular, but it definitely met with our approval. The fresh vegetable basket was a nice touch, the escargot a little bland, and the shrimp scampi entree didn't stand out. I wish I had sampled some of the more exotic menu choices, but I guess at least I have a reason to go back, which I most definitely will.
