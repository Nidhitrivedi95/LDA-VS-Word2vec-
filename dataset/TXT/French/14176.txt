58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw This lunch spot in Old Montreal looks quite unassuming from the street facade. However, the inside is quite spacious with a pleasing decor. The crowd is a mix of workers clad in business suit and trendy yuppies with plastic rimmed glasses.

The front of the restaurant also has a nice selection of takeouts, including some gourmet canned food like "Duck smoked meat". Please remember that as a great alternative the next time you have an urge to buy a "5 Dollar Foot Long" for dinner :P  

The food was quite good although I was a bit disappointed with the small size of my sandwich. My friend had the dish of the day (lamb rack served with polenta and veggies). Quite good and a good value according to him. The dessert made up for it. I tried both the Praline chocolate mousse and the Pecan pie: both delicious!

it won't be my everyday lunch spot but worth a try. Expect to pay a little bit more. It's however expected considering the location.
