rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Dined at Bouchon for the first time, with high expectations. Unfortunately, Bouchon was a disappointment.

We were seated within a couple of minutes of arriving, and were promptly offered water by our waiter. But oddly, he did not ask if we wanted any other beverages until 10 minutes later. Lost opportunity for alcohol sales.

We started with onion soup, which didn't have much of an onion taste. Very strange. The soup came out promptly, but we waited for about 30 minutes for the mains. For entrees, we had steak frites and the roasted chicken. Both dishes were on the bland side. Had to request salt for the table.

We skipped desserts. Probably would not return to Bouchon.
