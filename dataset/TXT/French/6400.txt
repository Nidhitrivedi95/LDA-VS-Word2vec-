4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Cute little French Bistro! It's the perfect place to sit outside in warm weather as well.

It was pretty busy when I went, so I'm not sure if that kind of attributed to the less than impeccable service (Hey, i get it. People get tired and overwhelmed so they only lost one star for this.) The other star is for the location. It's conveniently located on the strip and right across from the Bellagio and the water fountain, but at the time there was construction going on and the people that were walking by were the obnoxious drunks/people recovering from the night before.
But we didn't let that ruin our lunch, we took in the Bellagio Fountain shows that would come on ever 15-30 minutes and ate our Grilled Salmon and Spinach Salad, and Mon Ami Caesar Salads and basked in the warm Las Vegas weather.

Ultimately, it was pretty good.
Seeing as how we only ordered salads, I can't exactly give them major kudos on their food but the combination of ingredients in the salad were pretty good, and the spinach/lettuce leaves were very fresh.
