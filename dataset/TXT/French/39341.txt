jSfnItqaOnEp2nenVF7fCg Amazing food! Enjoyed lunch with family, had the Quiche Lorraine and it was cooked to perfection. I also enjoyed my favorite dessert, Creme Brûlée, and savored every last bite. Highly recommended. Hoping to try breakfast and dinner soon. My only wish is that this establishment was bigger.
