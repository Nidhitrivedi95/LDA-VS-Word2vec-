cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg This is almost a perfect restaurant.

I have family in Montreal and will see more of them because of this place-- I fell guilty telling them I eat here, 'cause they're strictly kosher- oops.

I was there two weeks ago and walking out I passed a pigs head on a platter with a whole lobster coming out of it's mouth!  outlandish!

I would like to try everything.. but I've thoroughly enjoyed the foie gras and maple syrup (might have been a special).  And duck in a can--
they walk up, open a can, and dump duck breast and foie gras onto a plate of toast... lovely.

Desserts- beautiful.. we had some kind of maple syrup/ice cream super hot dish-- unforgettable except I forget what it's called.

Very inventive-- very friendly, welcoming, english indulgent staff
