Tefx_N6A6nrsdj4jHHnbYg I was came to see my doctor and was so glad to be back at Le Petit. I needed a little something, but more substantial than a croissant and tried the croissant bread pudding. Yes, I know, it's made with left over croissants, but it was good. It came with a side of whipped cream, and it was chocolatey. It wasn't overly sweet but I liked the comfort bread pudding gives. I was satiated but when I looked over at the next table who was having a sandwich, I wished I could have ordered that too.
It's nice to be at small cafe like Le Petit where I don't feel like I'm in Vegas but maybe in somewhere in San Francisco. It's my go to spot when I'm in the area.
