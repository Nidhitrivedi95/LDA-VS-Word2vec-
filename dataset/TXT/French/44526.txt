MhFoFpLBx_Fy8gs9dlwtGA We first went to Au Petit Extra several years ago. Last Saturday we returned to celebrate Dad's 80th birthday. We chose exactly right. The food was wonderfully prepared. The ambiance was warm and welcoming. Our waiter could not have been better. He was a real pro. He was very helpful with choosing the right wine. Next time in town, we will be sure to return here.
