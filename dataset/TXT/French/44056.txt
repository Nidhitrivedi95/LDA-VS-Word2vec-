MdjIl105vqCYUGKFSUVytA My family thoroughly enjoyed our visit to this lovely restaurant. Located within walking distance of many downtown attractions, I would recommend calling ahead as it is quite popular. The service was wonderful. 

We had the salad bar which was perfect to satisfy without going overboard and had a nice selection to choose from, some things that you thought were familiar were made so much better by the quality ingredients (That's right bite-sized chocolate mousse, I am talking about you) All in all, that's what stood out.... familiar foods done so well, they became luxuries. Thank you for a great visit!
