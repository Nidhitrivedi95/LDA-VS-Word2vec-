4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Brought my gf here to surprise her.  Our first time.  Love the view, but not a fan of their service (well one of the waiters that barely served us).  Host was lovely and the table was in well view of the Bellagio Fountains.  Our first waiter, introduced us to their wine list and brought us some water.  Then the second waiter (probably lost) heckled us on what to drink even though I tried explaining that we have been helped already.  We ordered the Seafood Plater.  Very well done, but took longer than expected.  Our 3rd server had to come and let us know that they are behind (even though we came in at 11pm).  Lobster was well presented, shrimps were huge, and oysters were very fresh.  I hope it was just an off day on service, but still giving them 4 stars for the view and food.
