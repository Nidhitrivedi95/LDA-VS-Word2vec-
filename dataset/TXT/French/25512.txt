Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA Flew in late and we were staying here, so decided to spend our first night eating here to enjoy the amazing view from the 64th floor of Mandalay/The Hotel. My husband booked in advance, specifically requesting balcony seating so we could enjoy the view. We arrived early for our reservation and were seating in a corner inside, and were told, "sorry, only tables for larger parties were still available." We were bummed, but the interior decor is pretty cool to look at, with all the bubbles hanging from the middle of the room. I guess they were slammed because it took awhile for the server to get to us. He was a little standoffish at first but when my husband asked his name, he warmed up immediately. Once we ordered and told him we were starving, the food came out quickly. Four kinds of bread, including sourdough, french and dinner rolls. The bread was average but they include this homemade peanut butter that was to die for. My husband's first $16 martini was totally watered down. When he complained, they shouldn't have charged for it, and offered a second one to make up for it. My husband ordered the cod, which was unbelievable. Flaky and crispy skin on top and moist, buttery goodness underneath. Wow! Unfortunately, the other items we ordered were average. I got the scallops, which were fine. Nothing spectacular. A little on the small side. But their "famous" mac n cheese? I can't understand why it's famous? Very mediocre.
