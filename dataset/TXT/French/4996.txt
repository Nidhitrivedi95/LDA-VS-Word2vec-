The reason I gave it 4 stars because I want to try their wine and cheese but I like my coffee in the morning and my wine later at night and they close till 6. I get off work at 6 so when I want wine and cheese I have to go somewhere else because they're not open anymore but other then that this place is amazing and I have brought lots of my girls here for coffee!
