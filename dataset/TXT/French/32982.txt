H4N3wGaSJsy8hrNDtADmug Only eat here when you're drunk and it's the only thing open. The food is really mediocre and the service is bitchy. I got the "chinese" shrimp and noodles. It was macaroni with disgustingly salty canned shrimp. I'm not sure what I was thinking ordering that, but it was so disgusting I couldn't eat it. My friend's poutine was very mediocre. Overlooked fries. I've had better poutine at a fast food restaurant.

I'm not trying to be bitchy, but this place is not good.
