vLkKorA1gPS97Zj0_WKA0Q Went for the six course tasting meal without wine pairing. Enjoyed fanciful cuisine served by an attractive woman who hit certain marks, yet somehow left me less than fully welcome. She never lingered or fawned. Some would see this as a blessing, but as I was dining alone, a trifle stronger sense of hospitality was in order. I never got that, although both the maitre'd and the bartender did get that element. I received a free cocktail from the maitre'd while waiting for my table on the thin pretext that it wasn't ready for me at the appointed time. Ok, I liked that!

Food was very good, although not every morsel was an epiphany. Should it be?

I had a $13 glass of Italian Pinot Grigio with my meal. 

Highlights: 5 different dessert elements served together to taunt the palate. Separate serving dishes brought together. Overall lovely and fun.

Venison tenderloin medallions with sculpted root vegetables. 

Homarus Americanus served three ways, together as one course.

The setting of the dining room.... Magical. 23 stories above the bright Las Vegas Strip, yet somehow a world apart.

The exclusivity of the Mandarin Oriental... Priceless!

Do go with a date, if it's in your budget. Money well spent.
