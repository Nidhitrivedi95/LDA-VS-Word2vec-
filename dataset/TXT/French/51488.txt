pKiSzUlBBRNEdTML24piXA Ok... So I know this is the third update, but this place has really earned its stars! The BF and I went here for brunch on Sunday and it was one of the best restaurant experiences we have ever had. We were the only ones in the restaurant and it was like having brunch over at a friend's house. The chef, Eric, hung out with us and chatted with us about various topics throughout brunch and it was very pleasant. On top of that, the food was absolutely wonderful. We started with 5$ mimosas, which were large and incredibly tasty and coffee, which they serve with real cream... for real! I had an omelet with spinach, caramelized onions, roasted garlic, pancetta, and aged white cheddar. Eric suggested putting hollandaise sauce onto the omelet. Genius! It was creamy, savory, salty, sweet, and all around delicious. The BF had a blackberry waffle that had a mountain of fresh whipped cream that was actually whipped cream, not from a can or a tub.... Soooooo goooood. The quality of what you get at this restaurant is definitely worth the price and I, of course, will be back. 


If you want a friendly and comfortable place where you can get delicious and expertly prepared food... come here!!!
