qmh6zxtJ8C8-YiUPv7ySlw Daniel Boulud, I am a fan so my review is just a little biased.  

The restaurant is basically an upscale, Vegas-fied Brasserie.  The usual items like steak frites, tomato tart tatin, and a few shellfish dishes are of of course staples.  Definitely try the shortribs.  If you don't like shortribs, well too bad.  These shortribs are excellent.  I'm a huge onion soup fan, and this is one of my favorites that are readily available.  You can surely tell that the broth isn't quickly assembled, and has been layered and simmering for some time.  Ahhhhh.  

Truthfully, the service can be spotty and for what you're paying, you should expect just a little more attentiveness.  Is it enough to turn me away?  No, I'm going back.
