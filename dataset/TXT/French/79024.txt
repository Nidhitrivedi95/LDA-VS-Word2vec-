ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug Horrible horrible horrible! This place was just awful! 
$19 for steak and eggs. Ok np, it's the strip. But not for a grizzly NY strip that you can't even cut with a steak knife!!!!!! 
Their eggs Benedict were the worse I've ever had. This is actually the worse breakfast we've ever had for $50! The coffee tasted burnt. Our food was cold and disgusting! Geezuz, we would've had better luck at IHOP! 
So much for ending our staycation on a good note! 
We will never return. 
Oh and our server was not great either.
