sphMzEIqY1I2Dzv3zLZY2g I have found a new favorite Charlotte restaurant....in a very unlikely spot. Everyone in our group loved their entrees including the special Mahi which came with an creamy artichoke and chorizo sauce. She crab soup was also excellent and the apple berry tart was my favorite dessert.  The entire menu is done with an excellent flair. 

The wine list is especially interesting with some unusual choices and good value.  

Our server was was attentive but allowed us a very comfortable, relaxed pace.
