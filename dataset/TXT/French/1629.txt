0d6kx6Jlocw77y1J9nbqMA I am liking this place more and more everytime I go here.  I first went only for the sweets.  Their cupcakes are some of my favorites and its rare to find authentic macroons.  I finally went here for lunch and it was fantastic.  I got the chicken pesto sandwich and it was bomb.com.  I want to go here again for breakfast sometime.  
Only downfall, it can get pretty busy and theres usually only one server.  Not a big deal
