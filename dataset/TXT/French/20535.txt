AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw Agreed with the posting below. Almond croissant good, croque madame is super heavy. Cheese everywhere. Also, the egg on top looked really small and cut in half.

I did really enjoy the lobster eggs benedict though on the potato waffle. A really  interesting mix because of the savory lobster on top of a sweet waffle. I enjoyed it but some others at my table thought it was a little odd.
