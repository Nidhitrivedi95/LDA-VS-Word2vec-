Luckily the waitress speaks fluent English so even its a full French menu (on the chalkboard), she explains to us what they are. We had the creamy tomato soup (served cold), quail as appetizer, rabbit and veal chop as main course, creme brûlée and a cup of macchiato as dessert. Everything taste so good especially the veal chop, I asked for medium and it was served exactly how I wanted it cooked, not too rare, not too well, just awesome. Creme brûlée was a good try too. 

I was sick tonight so I had that "upset" face all night, hope they didn't think I dislike the dinner. I loved it, and I wished that they had one in Chicago.

PS: they don't serve wine there so bring your own bottle.
