4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Had the pleasure of having breakfast/brunch here. The mimosas are amazing, there coffee is great! They have non-dairy options of you want a cappuccino or mocha. Ok for real the whip cream is sooooo good! It had vanilla, cream and sugar but it was the perfect balance. It came with the waffles but I could be eaten by it self...no utensils necessary- that's how good it is. The bagels are ok not to write home about. But the date candies bacon!!!! The date candied bacon is DELICIOUS! Get it! Get it with whatever you get! It's that good. Located in Paris casino and right across from the Bellagio so you can watch the water fountain show as you enjoy your meal! The wait is long but worth it.
