YwBOJKaBp5Y8GzsTArlq-A I went with my husband.  The atmosphere is nice, they have kind of an irish/english pub vibe which is kind of neat.  My husband ordered a soup and grilled cheese, and I got the fish tacos.  The fish tacos were great, nice juxtaposition of flavors with cilantro, the fish and sauces.  However, my husband's soup was a this weird creamy onion soup.  Very bland.  The grilled cheese sandwich was bland as well, it was mostly fluffy white bread with a thin bit of boring cheese (how do you screw up grilled cheese?).  Anyways, the blandness of his meal kind of turned us off.  We each had a beer, the service was OK.
