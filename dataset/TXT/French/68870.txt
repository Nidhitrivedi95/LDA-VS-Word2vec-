vv7HKwsG6tloU4xho7QUBQ We had a lovely meal on Saturday evening in this place. Great value for money too, £10 for one course, £15 for two and £19.50 for three. 
Food is very, very tasty and well presented. The place has a nice homely feel about it, but I think it could do with being a little more cosy, perhaps turn the lights down a bit? 
The staff are lovely and are very diligent, we thought it was a little slow, but not so slow as to cause a problem. I think it just makes the place feel very relaxed.
