8xCiibfgqy-8xpCWEaguqg Just curious, is Chicago style steak supposed to look like it's over cooked like that or it's my problem(I ordered medium rare)... I asked the server what it was before I ordered it. I'm pretty sure it's not like what he described as beautiful color. It taste bitter, over cooked and taste like s**t. (Excuse my language)
