We went to celebrate our first wedding anniversary earlier this year and had an absolutely wonderful meal. It's not really French any more (apart from in name) but instead they focus on using beautiful, local ingredients. Many restaurants talk about provenance but rarely deliver - the opposite is the case at CSH. Everything on the menu is described in terms of where it came from - they can almost tell you the field that the beef came from or the name of whoever picked the broccoli.
The dining rooms are lovely - quite small, but intimate and very classy.
The service was fantastic - very professional and slick. They have a great knowledge of the food and the wine they sell.
All in all it's a fabulous place to go for a treat-yourself meal.
When we were there during the festival I did a double take when I walked past Richard Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens enjoying a meal together.
