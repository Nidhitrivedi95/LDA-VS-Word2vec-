O3OH5IEFMPtz7mPKakPZ3Q First, let me get to why it is one star short of perfect.... There were only my husband and I and another couple dining at the restaurant, and the food still took FOREVER!! Imagine if all the tables were filled?? 

Thanks to the chef for our complimentary truffle edamame. He probably heard us say how hungry we were because he knew it'd take a long time. I would have ordered appetizers, but we really didn't know it would take so long for our dishes to be done. The truffle edamame were really good. Better than your average. 

My hubs and I shared the 24oz bone in ribeye with 7 special salts and a yuzu truffle dip. We asked for Medium, but it came to use Medium rare. We didn't complain because omg we were starving and it took a long time for this to get to us. The flavor of the beef was ok. For a $65 steak, I usually expect flavor without having to use sauces, dips (or 7 salts). It was good with the dip and salts though.

We also shared a Nigerian Prawn w/ some kind of truffle flavor. This cost $26. That was pretty good. We each also got our own bowls of the Japaneiro Special fried rice $6/bowl. That was really, really good. Staff and service was great despite the wait. We'll be returning for more.
