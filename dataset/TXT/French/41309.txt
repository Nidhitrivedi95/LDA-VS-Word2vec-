kGOr_D-LNpgZ2M9N8TT4QQ My mother was in town for the weekend. I was looking for a nice brunch place through yelp...and settle with La Societe. It starts off pretty good, there place is not too crowded. Nice atmosphere. I had the egg benedict. The food was pretty good. My mom really likes it. The waiter was lacking proper servicing etiquette but he was nice. So, no big deal. And, after we paid the bill, we were rush out. My mom had to use the washroom. We sat at the table and waited for her return. At the meantime, we were told to leave the table because they have to prepare for the next sitting. I would think they can wait 5min for us to leave properly! I was very upset with that. That is a huge no-no for me. First for all, the service was slow, it toke the waiter quite a while to get us the bill. Secondly, there was no one at the front waiting for a table, hence, they could of wait for us to leave.  Thirdly, we didn't "hang around" for hours, we were there for about an hour and half, which I think is reasonable allocation of time for a brunch sitting. Not impress...Fail! I admit.....maybe One star is probably a bit harsh. But I am still quite upset with my experience, hence, they FAIL in my book!
