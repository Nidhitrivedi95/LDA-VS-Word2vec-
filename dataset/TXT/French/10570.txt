They don't take reservation if you want to sit outside on the patio. We usually made reservation for the dining room and when we arrive at the restaurant, if the wait for the patio is less than 30 minutes, we will wait and cancel the main dining room because it's worth it. Great for people watching and the view from Bellagio's fountain can't be beat. My favorite appetizer is the chicken pate.
