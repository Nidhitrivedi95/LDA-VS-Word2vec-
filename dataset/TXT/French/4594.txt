The owner is super nice and will encourage even the most timid speakers of French to speak to him in the belle langue, which is always fun. The coffee, croissant and baguettes are all excellent, but the real stars are the pastries, which are superb! We've taken them as dessert to parties that included food writers, and everyone was very pleased with them.
