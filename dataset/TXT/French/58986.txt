rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w I was very excited about Le Cirque and it turned out to be a disappointment. While the service was good, I thought the food could be improved. I found it to be too rich. What I was most impressed with were the plates themselves. They were very nice plates and probably some of the best I've ever eaten on.
