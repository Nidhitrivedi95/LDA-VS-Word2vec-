XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q what can I say, this place is great!! I would highly recommend to try the pre fix menu. they offer a 7 course meal for $250 per person or a 16 course meal for $350 per person. Every item is delightful, the atmosphere is astonishing they service is awesome. Joel R came back from retirement to open this amazing restaurant in Las Vegas and I'm glad he did! so If you want to spend some extra money and treat your palate You have to go and experience this restaurant
