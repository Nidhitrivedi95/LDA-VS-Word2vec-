ynYEgNimJOyb8dvyr9x0sA Amazing! From the food to the service to the wine selection! Me and my boyfriend went there for dinner, our server Chris was great, the other server Tim that was working was just as friendly and engaging. We got the salmon pizza like appetizer which was great. Followed by the french fondue and beef fondue, with chocolate fondue to top it off. I wanted the carmel, my boyfriend suggested we do that next time, and they actually brought us some to try. Above and beyond service and amazing food! We will definitely be going back!
