oS96aJIHFWcFAlGHKKXjaw I love this bakery so much.  Anytime I'm walking my dog past their storefront on the weekends, there is always a line to the door.  The occasional dog will be tied to a tree in the front of the place while their owner waits patiently inside to be served.  Once you're at the counter, (the wait is no longer than a few minutes) you're greeted by some of the most down to earth sweetest people in food service.  They'll explain everything there is to know about each piece in their display, discuss pairings, shelf life and how to keep their products fresh for your special event, or just because you want to try something new.  The prices are more than reasonable, and some of their pastries are really elaborate and unique.  They make a really great pot of coffee too!
