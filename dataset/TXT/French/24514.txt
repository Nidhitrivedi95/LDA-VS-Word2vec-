cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg OMG, the best restauarant ever...

If you love foie gras, this place is it.... Our party was honestly getting sick of it by the end... 

foie gras poutin was meh, as the cheese was still hard

foie gras stuffed pigs foot was great...
bison tongue: great

Best dish is the foie gras with bacon, maple syrup, egg, and something else... i dont even know the name of the dish, but this was the absolute best dish

great bang for buck appetizer is the guinea hen fowl liver spread...(cheap man's foie gras)
