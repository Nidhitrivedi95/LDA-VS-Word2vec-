FRuuIDOd21pTJHvEGIt1Gg Really nice restaurant in old Montreal.  This is a really nice place to take a date.  The wine selection is wonderful.  For me, the beer selection is pretty weak, but that's pretty much what I find all over Montreal, so it's hard to ding the place on that.  Food was great, and I'd go back here any day.  The free wifi was nice too.
