4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Wow so decadent.  The service was attentive and polite.  We ordered an olive plate as well as some goat cheese appetizer and by the time our food came, which included a soup, I'm sad to say I was hardly able to eat it!  Very very good, but choose wisely and don't let your eyes be bigger than your stomach!

Generous portions and everything is very rich.  Great wine selection, too.
