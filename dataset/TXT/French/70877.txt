xBxDMEkFK5GBhiy-8gGE9w The food were expansive and we knew we were paying for the view and location. Our waitress knew we couldn't speak French and she got us a "simplified"  English menus. I wish they have a better English menus. We ordered sea snails which were pretty good. Foie gras was very generous and they gave us a lot of bread. The salad was ok. I asked the waitress to explain the foods and she wasn't able to reply in English. So she just explained in French, which we didn't understand. Guess it is our fault.
