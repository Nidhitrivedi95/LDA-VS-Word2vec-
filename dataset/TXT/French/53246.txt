QeFsIMcIFIJcOrpthYL8jg Do you know what $17 spaghetti bolognaise tastes like? You can find out at Modavie. Definitely a little expensive for spaghetti, but it was the best spaghetti I've ever had. The French Onion soup was pretty darn good too! We were just walking around Montreal (We're from the US so we didn't have smart phones without date charges! NO YELP!) and we just stopped by here to have dinner and drinks. The service was excellent and the wine was too!
