OYHpqY6-3C-wXR-uPbHhwA This morning went to Honey Cakes for breakfast. Based on 3 eggs and bacon, this place was a huge disappointment. The portions were large, the counter person was lovely, however that's all we can say good about it. The 3 eggs were supposed to be over medium, but were totally dried out, hard yokes, and burned brown on the bottom. The bacon was mostly fat and barely cooked, with running grease. The potatoes were cubed with some onion, but flavorless, cool, and hard. No tomato juice and orange juice was only available in small pre-packaged bottles. The server could not have been more distant or aloof. Other people seem to have had better luck with other dishes, but we will never return.
