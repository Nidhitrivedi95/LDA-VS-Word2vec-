tCSlpwJQ4CZsUEMZeH2SFg I absolutely love this little restaurant! The food is delicious every single time and I have tried nearly everything on the menu!! My husband and I both say this is our favorite restaurant in Charlotte. It never lets us down - if you're looking for a delicious place to grab some food, look no further! The staff is great as well!
