dubu2kN3Y9EB4uYGFWa0MQ Service was impeccable! In the MORNING. Service in evening NOT so GOOD. First for dinner. Had the cheeseburger, came with fries also had the berry cake (something like that). Berry cake I would pass on in future. Cheeseburger was think, juicy and very good. Fries standard fair. Now for breakfast. Ordered seasonal fruit and eggs Benedict. I was asked how I would like my eggs and they were PERFECT!  The potatoes leave a lot to be desired. I will note I made my server aware of my allergy and they made sure to keep my food clear. I would not order the fruit again, only because the price for a few thin slices isn't worth it. The coffee is rich and delicious. PAUL D. is the server to have!  He's got service on his mind. The food both times was good but the morning service, will make your day!
