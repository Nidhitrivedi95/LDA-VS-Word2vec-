xcmmTXhuMx2fZF2Bt69F4w I decided to take a friend here for lunch today, 8/17/12, as a token of my gratitude for helping me with a project. I have been a fan of the Point Brugge and Park Brugge for several years and knew that I could not go wrong.  We were very fortunate to have Tilman wait on our table who made our experience extra special. He recommended one of the lunch specials so my friend and I decided to share it along with a lunch menu item. Tilman is charming, attentive and funny, he ranks in the top 10 of my list of outstanding restaurant employees. BTW the lunch items were excellent.
