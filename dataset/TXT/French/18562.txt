aaWhSHpsE285eaSTzDxAMA Had dinner there last night for the first time. Both the food and service were amazing! Barbara was our server and gave us perfect suggestions on what to order. We had the beet and goat cheese salad, the pistachio dates and the bacon wrapped scallops for an entree. OMG. The food was spectacular and Barbara took amazing care of us. I can't wait to go back!
