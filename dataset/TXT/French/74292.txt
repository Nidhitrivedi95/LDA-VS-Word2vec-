xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g Let me paint a picture of our evening. 
Call to make reservations at Andre's, the French restaurant at another hotel. 
Get a standard phone message, stating to leave time, date, and number for a reservation. I do as I was told, left said info, got all dressed up, walked across the street ( no easy feat, as you need to walk 2 blocks to do so) only to find out that the restaurant was closed for reservations. 

Bummer, Big Time !! I'm all dressed up, and no French Restaurant,
We start walking the strip, me in a funk, when all of a sudden, the BF's light-bulb goes off. Let's do Paris Hotel -- they got to have a Frog Restaurant there. 
We wanted to do the Eiffel Tower anyway -- so Yeah--- I'm there. 
We don't actually go to the top of the Eiffel Tower ( they want an extra $25 bucks or something close for the 2 of us), but we get off the elevator just short of the top. 

Beautiful. Wow. Superb View. 
The strip in all it's glory is before us. 
No reservations -- No problem, as long as we're willing to sit toward the back, as all the window ( great view) tables have been reserved. A table in the back...sure, we're just happy to get in. 
We're given a booth along the wall, which is high up on a platform, so you still get the night skyline. 
Our wait staff comes in a procession. 
First the water guy, then the busser who turns glasses...then our waiter. He is funny, charming, from Eastern Europe, and has just enough polish to pull off a high ticket restaurant without any pompousness. 
We like him from the get. 
The BF is starving, so our waiter suggests the Steak. 
Done 
I love rabbit and order the rabbit Napoleon. 
A nice Cab for me, a frog beer for the BF -- we're happy people again. 
The food was outstanding, the service even better.
Romance was in the air, for sure. 

Tre' Bon
