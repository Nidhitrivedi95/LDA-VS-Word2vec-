4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw What I Ordered: It was lunch, but I was feeling like eating brunch food so I ordered the Seafood Crepes. It consisted of a crepe with large, grilled shrimp and scallops with a cream sauce. The crepe contained peas and a cream filling. The dish was topped off with fresh raw spinach. 

What I Thought: The crepe was light and tasted great with the peas and cream sauce. The shrimp was seasoned well and tasted good, but a little overcooked. The scallops were my favorite part. It was cooked perfectly, seasoned well, and had a nice crust on it. 

Overall: I thought the dish was good, but seemed to lack that oomph. Really this dish should be 3.5 stars if Yelp would let me. The restaurant itself is situated in a cool spot overlooking the strip across from the Bellagio Fountains.
