cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg IMA in Montreal.  I loved Au Pied de Cochon!  First, the room is casual, nicely lit, and has a great feel to it.  It is the kind of place where you know you are going to have a fun night.  But of course, you are there for the food and drink.  Unfortunately, they were out of the duck in a can, but it ended up being a blessing because we got to try the Guinea Hen for two, which was one of the best meals I've ever had.  I also enjoyed the fois gras poutine and some of the appetizers. 

I appreciate that the restaurant also has some very reasonably priced wines on their expansive yet focused wine list. 

All in all, a home run.
