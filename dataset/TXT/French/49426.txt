or4UVDjXEEjze3wNPjoAZA One of the best restaurants in Phoenix! Come on the Chef/Owner used to be the Poissonnier at the French Laundry! AKA the fish Chef for one of the best restaurants in the world. So obviously I would recommend the Mussels appetizer and Scallop entree. Service is old school great, you might have 3-4 servers quietly hovering around your table anticipating your every need. Can't wait to go back!
