RfsMUrGUJdrpfrU54rmEsQ Went on a Friday night to listen to some jazz blown away by the music food and staff. All were amazing. The escargot was like Paris. So yummy and so much garlic lol.  bruchette was also very good  cannot say enough about the staff. They were amazing even though the place was packed.  Look forward to making this a place I will go back again and again.
