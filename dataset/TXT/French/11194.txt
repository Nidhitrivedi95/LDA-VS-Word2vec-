4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Wish I could say, it was packed because of the quality of the food.

Restaurant is right on the strip, in front of Paris, and facing the bellagio fountains. It's all about location, location, location! 

Our party of four came on a saturday night for dinner. Of course it was a full house. We were told it would be an hour wait for inside & an hour and a half for outside. Since it was getting late we opted for whatever was fastest. Thankfully we only waited roughly 45 mins & we were even seated outside :) YAY lucky us!

Tables and seating arrangements were really narrow. Complimentary bread was pretty yummy - your typical french bread. Except they gave butter and this interesting shredded carrot spread. Oddly enough, it was actually quite good with the bread. LOL!

I ordered the steak classique with maitre d hotel butter. ($23.95), which is a large thin cut of steak with an herb butter sauce. It was good but nothing outstanding. The meat was a large piece, but thin so when asked for medium, it was more medium well to well done. The fries that accompanied it were overfried & overly crispy.  

The rest of my party wasn't too impressed as well. They got the filet mignon, steak bordelaise, and scallops. Our table rated the scallops as the best thing that night.

Ambiance was nice, romantic, but over crowded so it kinda killed the romance. Service was just okay. Kinda had to ask for refills on bread & soft drinks. They were good about refilling water though. Best thing about the place is sitting outside on the patio watching the bellagio show while eating. Would I go back? Surprising to say but probably not. I could have ate better quality & more at a buffet for the price.
