And then I loved them again for improvising a platter for us of anything they could pull together from an as-yet-unopened kitchen, which ended up being a bunch of my favorite things, oysters, charcuterie, house roasted nuts, pickled things. They have a pretty patio but the real sweet spot for me is the square vintage lovely couch in the back, perfect for late night libations with incorrigible but probably a little bit corruptible friends.
