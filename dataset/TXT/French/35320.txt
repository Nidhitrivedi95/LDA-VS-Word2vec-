Ht-_i0UAq7YDBaqJwcQMdQ Wow, wow, and more wow. Every single thing that we ate here was simply delicious. I don't think you can go wrong with whatever you order. We got risotto and octopus apps. For dinner we ordered veal chops, pork, and halibut. I was in heaven with each bite. 

And for dessert it was almost death by chocolate! :-) I'm a big chocolate lover and ordered a plate with 3 different chocolate items and it was for sure a great ending to an amazing meal. I didn't want it to end!!
