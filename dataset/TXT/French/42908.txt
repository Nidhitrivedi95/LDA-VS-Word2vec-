LnSjzFXh1GrOObsRP6LhBQ This place is located right by my office which makes it a regular enough haunt. I like it...and don't like it...for different reasons, making it a solid 3. 

The good: The food and coffee here is great: excellent crepes, incredibly light and fluffy with lots of filling. Nice rich americanos too,and a wide selection of pastries and desserts. 

The bad: Way overpriced. Basic pastries are $4-5 and their smoothies are expensive and just FULL of sugar. Unsure if there's any actual fruit in them despite being the "healthy" option. 

The average: Service is okay: friendly at times and lax at others. 

Definitely a worthwhile lunch stop (crepes!) but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here.
