 I ordered the Chicken and Mushroom crepe.  I loved how there was a lot of mushrooms on top and inside the crepe.  The chicken was tender, too.  

 For dessert, we ordered the Proliferates.  This is basically a cream puff filled with vanila ice cream.  I really enjoyed this dessert.

 Overall, service was very good here.  The prices are fairly reasonable.  I would definitely come back.
