The server, very pleasant, informed us of how the beef is prepared fresh, and the buns used are house made.  

When I got my burger I realized why. 

They have to house make the buns because No bakery makes buns small enough to hold  the small patty used by Toma. Mind you the sweet bun and burger was juicy and tasty.

Ordered a side of onion rings. The onion rings were pre fab. It passed as gourmet because of the sprinkle of Parmesan and parsley on it.  Couldn't shake the fact that it cost $9.00 and that it came frozen out of the bag.  Do us justice and charge $5.00. 

No parking and no value to the menu however the morsel of burger I had I have to admit was good.
