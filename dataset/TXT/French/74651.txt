xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g What a wonderful place to celebrate my 40th birthday. I made a reservation to sit in the window to watch the water show below, and it was spectacular. The food was probably the best meal I've ever had! The filet mignon was cooked to perfection. I loved the bread basket that had a lovely selection of baked items to choose from. Great service and romantic setting. Will go again!
