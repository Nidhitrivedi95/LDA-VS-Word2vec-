Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA Food is very good, and the view is outrageous. They run late night specials and there is no better way to end a night (over 50 crowd) or start a night (under 30 crowd). All will be happy here. You can even sit outside, high above the noise of the casino floors, under the warmth of a heater and just smile.
