_T7f2wUgNlJqxsR-cR89SQ I tried foie gras for the first time here and man, it was GOOOOD....  Perfectly seared with a slightly cold center.  The food is excellent and romantic.  Service is incredible.

Ate here with my aunt and uncle who's wallets are pretty deep - you can get one of the best meals in Toronto here.  Great wine list.

Free valet (at least when I went) which is convenient because parking isn't great in this area.
