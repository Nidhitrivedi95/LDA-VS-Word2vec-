d482l58ho0_IMdFkXX1F5Q I know there are lots of good reviews for this restaurant but I'm about to bust your bubble. I had high hopes for his restaurant but I was really disappointed. My family and I went here for our Thanksgiving dinner. First off our table wasn't ready when we got here when they specially told us to be there on time when we booked. I tried to get a drink at the bar and when I requested a drink that wasn't on the menu the bartender rolled his eyes and said "I don't make that". Ok thanks for the attitude. 

We finally get dinner. We had a large dinner which was good, brought our own wine & user the corkage fee. The main thing that I have to complain about this restaurant is the service. It took forever to get out food, our wine corked, even the initial introduction from our waitress took forever. We would request additional condiments, water or utensils from busers...and would constantly have to remind them when they returned to our table without the requested items. 

We informed the waitress after dinner and at the time we ordered coffee that we had a show to catch and would need the coffee to come out as soon as possible. We also ordered a Resling 15 minutes prior to the coffee that has not yet arrived. 20 minutes later our coffee arrive as did the Resling finally.  We total the man bringing the Resling that we didn't need it anymore because he has a show to catch and wouldn't have time. He said it would take less than a minute to open in which case I replied "And how long do you anticipate it will take us to drink?" 

I thought the service for a restaurant of that caliber was really subpar. I probably will not return to the restaurant and will probably recommend anyone that asks to stay away.
