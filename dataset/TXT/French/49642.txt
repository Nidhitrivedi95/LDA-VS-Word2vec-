or4UVDjXEEjze3wNPjoAZA Zinc Bistro is an interesting French brasserie style restaurant. They clearly went out of their way to give it a French feel with the interior decor. We had reservations, and were seated at a nice table in the back near the kitchen. We had a team of two servers (apparently they were training a new one), which was fine. Both very sociable. 

I ordered lamb shanks, and my mum ordered the scallops. To start we had the Zinc House Salad, which we asked to be split, and they did into two places (plus points for this). We ordered wine with dinner (I had a Bordeaux and mum had Vouvray), both our selections. The food was excellent. My lamb shanks were tender, and had a very tasty sauce. The scallops were also very tasty and the sauce it was in was very good. 

As we were dining, mum noticed that the banquette was dusty. We could see this because the sun was just at the right angle. This was a major issue at the prices we were paying for this meal, and really is a ding that this restaurant could have easily avoided (by dusting the banquettes daily??). 

Positives:  Great food, good service, nice atmosphere and decor. 
Negatives: Price, dusty banquette. 

Grades

Overall:  B-   (This would be a "B+" however, the dusty banquette merits
                       a grade reduction)

Food:     B    - It was great food, but the prices were a little steep. 
                      The menu was also fairly limited. 

Drinks:   A-    - Good selection of wine here mostly French / Italian, 
                       and pricing is good. Beware though, no cheap wine here.

Service  A-     - Our servers were social, and very nice. Formal table 
                         service akin to France. Plus points to our server for
                         not recommending just the most expensive things on 
                         the menu.
