63in7ND_-TPVVI_J12JLRA Really solid restaurant. Great service from the volunteer staff. The food was really excellent as well- had a dhaal soup and a lamb dish and creme brulee that were all really well made. The value is pretty good as well (something around 40 canadian with gratuity included for a soup/entree/dessert). would definitely recommend.
