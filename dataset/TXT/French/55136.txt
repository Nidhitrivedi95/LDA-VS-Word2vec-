rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A After hearing so much about this place, I convinced Cal that we had to try it. We got there around 7:30am, but they don't open for brunch until 8am. It was okay though because we got to explore the pool area right outside. When we finally got in, we were offered a table inside or outside. It was too chilly to sit outside, but we got a nice view from where we sat. The bread, butter and jelly reminded me of breakfasts I had at my host parent's home, while I studying abroad in Strasbourg, France. It tasted the same, too. Definitely brought back wonderful memories. And everything just went up from that point. The service was great. The food was wonderful. Cal had the quiche with salad, and I had eggs in white sauce, with sausage. Everything was so creamy and tasty. And of course, we had the famous pomme frites! I really enjoyed the entire experience. This was the best Vegas trip I've ever had, and the Venetian was definitely a big reason why it was so great.
