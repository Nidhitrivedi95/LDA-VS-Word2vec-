4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Stop by this place for a late lunch.  Good value compared to other restaurants on the strip. I had a seafood crepe. Be aware the scallop will be sliced fairly thin.  There were done micro greens sprinkled on top flowing out of the crepe was a Béchamel sauce with sweet peas.  While a good starting point I would have preferred since seasoning in the sauce... Not need just not memorable... The sauce would have made the difference.
