C3PVq7UpeHd6nz1_e-AtkA After a bit of an issue trying to meet friends for a brunch that didn't work out, we luckily found a parking spot right outside Kalendar and decided to have brunch here.  We needed to be seated pretty quickly as my boyfriend is injured at the moment and needs to be seated comfortably.  The staff was very friendly and even offered to make an accommodation for him that would have prevented them from being able to seat people at the table next to us.  The coffee was delicious and we learned it is a special blend that they add cinnamon to.  I had the french toast and my boyfriend had an omelette.  The food came quickly and was tasty.  I really like the atmosphere here as it is cozy and makes me appreciate the winter, if that makes sense.
