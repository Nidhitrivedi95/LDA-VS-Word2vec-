c8j5MQqlb0RhgS_bpxMDuA We went there in the middle of the afternoon for drinks and snacks. Beautiful relaxing terrace with an amazing façade facing the street (maybe to maintain the old world integrity of the area) and nice trees on the inside. Perfect place to hang out with old friends. Inside looked very modern and a good alternative if the weather is not cooperating for the seating on the terrace. Food was good although they were out of cheese for the poutine so I decided to go for a similar style dish that is more of a Portuguese style, not sure if it is even on the menu since it was suggested by the wait staff as we felt like poutine that day. The mayo on the side was delicious so do not forget to use it as a dip for the fries. The second app was grilled scallops with risotto and lobster oil. I am not a fan of risotto so not sure why I ordered this dish, probably because of the scallops. Liked the two scallops, however the quantity of risotto overpowered the overall dish. I would go for something else next time. Service was good. I would recommend this place to others
