63hkYvXXcZsHeCeZBQbfew I was so so happy to finally get a decent shawarma. I ordered a chicken shawarma, with toum, not hummus (makes all the difference), and it was incredibly satisfying. I don't even like chicken! But Shawarmaz was excellent. I got my food to go and I wish I had a chance to visit it once more. The prices are quite cheap, but the portions are a bit small. If you're really hungry, maybe order 2. I can't wait to visit Montreal again just to come here!
