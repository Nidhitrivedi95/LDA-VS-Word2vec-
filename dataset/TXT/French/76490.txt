Yp9w4nhUowBU_IS_StFXbQ Basically the best breakfast I've ever experienced! I was planning on attending the Wynn Buffet, however the hour long wait was unbearable after a night of drinking. Someone recommended Tableau so I decided to take a look at their menu. The whole thing was just elegant and relaxing. You can sit inside or opt to be seated outside; looking over the pool area.
    I ordered the breakfast meal that included:
coffee, juice, pastries, eggs, toast or English muffin, bacon, and YUMMY hashed potatoes balls. Loved it and would highly recommend this spot. Pricey for a breakfast. My meal was $26.
   Wish I had more time to try their dinner!
