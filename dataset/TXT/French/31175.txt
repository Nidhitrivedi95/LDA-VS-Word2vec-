ggIWkJtgXHKnhdxRu338AQ Went here with a wedding party during Winterlicious 2013.  The place is quite elegant, and the location easily accessible yet hidden from the main street.  Every dish I tried was a pleasant surprise, and everyone was quite happy.  The service was outstanding, everyone worked with a smile.  The owner (or co-owner?) even came to check on us a few times, offering his best wishes.  Will visit again!
