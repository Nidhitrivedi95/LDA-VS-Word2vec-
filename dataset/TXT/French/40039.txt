K67pkQljTFTW_P-7xUQrFw Pros:
-BYOB = save lots of money especially in a big group
-Complimentary bread was good, better than most others
-Relatively cheap prices compared to other fancy restaurants: most entrees were under $30 and appetizers under $10 each.

Cons:
-You get what you pay for, food was sub par: I ordered a medium-rare fillet mignon and it was tough as nails. My friend ordered a medium regular steak and it was actually more tender than mine. 

-Portions were meager, expect to go home with half a stomach full of bread.

-Other friend ordered frog legs and it was not marinated at all so it was bland even after numerous dippings in sauce, I know because I also tried a piece, so did half the table. It was so bad that she could not finish half the dish and after we complained to the waitress, she waived the entree off her bill.

-Very noisy atmosphere for a fancy restaurant, probably due to the 3 storey design.
