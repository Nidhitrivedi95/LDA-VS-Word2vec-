0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g We loved the art and the whole abiance of the place - it will give you a good LV experience, especially if this is your first time in LV.. We've been always meaning to have dinner here, but felt it would be too much of a tourist trap, so finally we tried it.  I thought the main course and appetizers were better then deserts, but overall, we had a good experience and would certainly come again.. There're definitely other 5 star places in LV, slighly off the beaten path, but this restarant is definitely in the top 10 in my experience (for Vegas and taking the fact that Bellagio has TOn of foot traffic, tourists, etc, Picasso managed to not turn into a revolving door of just eaters.. if you know what i mean).
