kcF-en40P3J9L8nLy5lKqQ Love love love this place!! Was in town for a girls weekend and we considered coming here twice!! We should've because the more popular place we went to night 2 was not NEARLY as good as this one! Everything we ate was fantastic- drunk bread, burrata, bolognese. Service was awesome and great wine selection too. Conveniently located right next to the Dry Bar which was perfect for our girls weekend!
