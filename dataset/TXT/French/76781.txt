ysJo5Jdo29XOBCnKrbUKWg Definitely as good as it gets. . . outside of France. I was super surprised to have such a French meal in the States as I had at Paris 66. Granted I was only there once and for a late lunch. 

But the tuna nicoise salad had the freshest delicate anchois (anchovies) as I eat in the South of France every summer. I am hooked! 

A delicate glass of Sancerre and the nicest servers topped off my experience. 

Some may say it is expensive, I do agree for lunch it's quite a price. But I didn't eat for dinner as it was really huge salad -- that's probably the only American thing about this place!
