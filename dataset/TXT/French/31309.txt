gh6__q2WXFuyN8gt6VAnWw I love this place! Authentic food prepared to perfection! My husband and I decided to try this place because the menu looked interesting. They did not disappoint! We opted to have a lot of small plates including the frog legs, house made chorizo, escargot, pig ears and chicken gizzards to name a few. Everything was amazing! The host/ owner was kind hearted and passionate about the food of her homeland and it definitely came through in her incredible recipes! Highly recommended! We will be back again and again!
