4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw It was late and the husband and I hadn't eaten dinner yet.  I was fearful that we wouldn't find a thing considering it was prime time dinner time in Vegas on one of the busiest (for weddings) weekends of the year (10/10/10).

Mon Ami Gabi, is not only fun to say, but is a casual french-style dining experience.  The menu had all sorts of good red meat choices: steaks and whatnot; and some onion soup, etc.  But the pricing seemed ... eh ... a little high.  But whatever, we managed to get a seat at the teeny bar (seats 6-8) and talked it up with the bar guy, really cool dude.

This is going to sound boring, but Dave and I ordered the onion soup and shared a burger (we did not intend to go all out this night), which was the perfect choice for the bar seating, right?  Heck yes. The burger was simple in its presentation, nothing out of the ordinary, but the cooking temp and size and vehicle were stupendous and delicious!  So juicy and came with some great skinny frites (those French!!).
