After traveling to Paris I thought I'd never get to taste croque madame again. Little I knew i won't get to taste it but will have probably one of the best croque madames created. 

From the entrance till exist it's a cozy feel without any snootiness. It's not your fro
Fro fancy white table restaurant but it's nothing short of class in a warm way.

Their food smells and tastes of freshness. 

Of course you can't beat the location. It just can't get more Parisian alike than this area. Right in the heart of old Montreal it's away from the touristy area yet not too quiet. Very good for people watching.

Generous portions, especially the skillets, and not at all pricy. You'll definitely leave satisfied. 

The server who we were lucky to have two days in a row, was very friendly and took his time to explain the menu. 

Being such a gem of a place you'll expect lots of people and since they don't take reservations you might have to wait a bit. But if you get there before 11am you'll easily get a table.

Just do yourself a favor. When in Montreal give your taste buds a culinary treat and enjoy their brunch. You'll be glad you did.
