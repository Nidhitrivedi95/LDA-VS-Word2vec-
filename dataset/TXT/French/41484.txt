kIW8IeTV3W1tS_q_WAU4wQ Came here for a big celebration with friends and already went back. every loved their meals. starters: Carpaccio, tuna tataki, but the foie gras with the blueberry tart is seriously one of the best THINGS I've ever eaten. period. as for the entrees? Contre-filet de boeuf (is a HUGE 10oz) and get the extra foie gras. but everyone who had the famous tartares were very very happy too. This is ranked in my top five restaurants in Montreal for food, and top three for value.
