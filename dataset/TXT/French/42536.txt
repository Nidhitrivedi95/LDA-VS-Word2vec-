LHwzyN5cllTfLuZ8v2k_Bg Came here on Friday night on a last-minute date whim. We didn't make reservations and the place was packed, but we managed to snag a table on the back patio.

3 star food but everything else is 4+ star worthy.

Lots of classic French bistro dishes. The prices are extremely reasonable. Entrees around $14-$17, appetizers for $5-$7 and desserts for only $5. Even the wine was cheap - $15 for a 1/2 liter of house red or white.

The menu changes daily but they had a varied selection with 4-5 fish dishes, plus plenty of beef, chicken and lamb.

Very excellent and attentive service.

The interior is quite large and made up of several oddly shaped rooms; I imagine it was some kind of manor house turned into a restaurant. There's a small patio at the front but a way better patio at the back. 

Lots of OLD patrons eating here. I'm talking 65+. 

We tried a fish terrine and the Auvergnate salad with blue cheese, walnuts and apples to start. Both were just OK. The mains were much nicer, I had lamb shank (yum!) served Moroccan style with chickpeas, etc. My date had some kind of beef dish which was really good too.

The creme caramel was HUGE. Double size of what I've had in other restaurants. I only tried a bite but it was delicious.
