H464UiJ5c7q5dAJ14h731A Whenever someone asks for a restaurant recommendation my reply is always Gus. No matter the occasion, Gus is my go-to reply! I personally love sitting at their bar and chatting with David, the chef. David and his staff are always friendly and make sure you're having a special night out in their cozy space. Totally recommend their Caesar salad (get it with lobster and caviar) and their margarita. Just writing this review is getting me excited for my next visit!
