They have a variety of pastry and dessert items. Everything is fresh and delectable. 

Macarons: They are huge! These and the ones from Bottega Louie are my favorites. The macaron is light and airy with just the rest amount of sweetness and flavor. 

Banana Nut Muffin: Yum, great flavor and texture. 

Blueberry Muffin: It's ok, I prefer the banana nut one more. 

Almond Croissant: Oh so delicious! It's not too sweet. It has just the right amount of almond paste. The croissant is light and flaky. 

Chocolate Almond Croissant: It was good but I rather have the almond one. 

Red Velvet Cupcake: It was not too sweet. The cupcake was still very moist even after it was left out for a day! Great flavor and it went really well with my vanilla latte. 

There are a few other items that I didn't have the time and stomach space LOL to try, but I am definitely going to every chance I get.
