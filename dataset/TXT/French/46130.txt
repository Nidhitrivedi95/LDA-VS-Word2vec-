myJ6pgIhN42EQh2sAVXKoQ I had come into this place still hungry after a business meeting at a very unaccommodating neighbouring Italian restaurant where there was very little focus on customer experience and dietary adjustments. 
This place was amazing in comparison. 
If you are looking for a clean,comfortable welcoming atmosphere to enjoy a great burger and fries this is the place. 
The server Victoria was friendly, gracious and articulate and they had gluten free options and attention to dietary preferences. I will happily return and recommend it to anyone looking for a casual to dine alone or with a few friends. Very relaxing.
