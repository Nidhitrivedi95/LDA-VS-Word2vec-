I made a reservation from the hotel and was greeted by a friendly waiter who took our coats and gave me a special message.  It was a hand written letter from the Chef Jerome Ferrer, I've never been given anything like that to begin a meal, I was impressed.

Looking at the menu I was a bit disappointed.  I have a mushroom allergy and could not eat most of the entrees, and I hate being a bother.  I settled on a dish called Morue which is fillet of cod, homemade tomato ketchup tapenade, potato espuma and peas emulsion.  Well I'll never say settled again....it was phenominal.

We were also treated to multiple appetizers including a cheese cigar served in a humidor, a lobster creme cappuchino, and a wonderful pistachio dessert.

This place was wonderful and made you feel very special.  The waitstaff is great at what they do and you will enjoy yourself completely.  Oh and the huge bill I though I was going to have was just upwards of $200 with tip.  Very resonable.
