WOd8tWsh2Yt_osHv-ngx_w We went here to fill up on breakfast before heading up Mont Royal and it was a perfect choice. They have so many breakfast options and so many different combination plates to choose from. I always love a breakfast places that can give you plates with many different types of food on them! The price was reasonable and we enjoyed all of the food here! There's lots of seating inside and outside so you shouldn't need a reservation (it was 10-11 when we showed up and they took us right away). The service was great too!
