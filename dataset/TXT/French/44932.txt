mT8Ej8sKFJoIa5G0Vl4AKA Just got done being sick for days after eating at Baton Rouge on Fete d'National. You would think on such a day in QC at Place des Arts that they would be serving fresh food. Wrong!

We ordered two racks of ribs. Both were old, burnt and dried out. To hide this they were dripping with sauce. Cole Slaw was sour and rancid, a baked potato was cooked so long it was not edible  and the fries were cold and tasteless. 

When the waiter asked how our meal was I told him that he had served us garbage on a plate. Both were partially eaten and he did wipe the bill. 

Never again shall we eat at Baton Rouge!
