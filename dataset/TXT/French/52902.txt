QeEQXdto_4wFRaNKyIygRA We stopped by for dinner on a Wednesday - pretty quiet inside. We were intrigued by the Beef Tips special on the board outside, as we enjoy some New England Steak Tips and thought this might be similiar - wrong. Turned out to be  more like stew beef over rice, not what we were expecting but also not notably tasty. It was served with big broccoli stalks randomly covered in cheese - also not my fav.
The saving grace of this meal was the Salt & Pepper Wings. So good! I asked for a side of hot sauce in case they were bland but it wasn't needed. Super crispy and tasty, I might go back again just to have those. The wings saved this from being a 2 star adventure.
Service was OK, could have been more on-point given how slow they were that evening.
