1aj4TG0eFq6NaPBKk6bK7Q Was excited to go to this place based off the reviews. Beautiful decor at restaurant, you order the meal and then they bring it to your table. For an afternoon this place wasn't very busy. 
I started waiting at the front with the cashier telling me to wait so she can finish what she was doing before she took my order. Once she was done being way too busy to help us, she finally looked up and took our order. I thought how long she took to help us was a little rude, especially because there wasn't anyone in front of us who had just ordered. 

We sat ourselves and our food was delivered promptly. The burger I had was supposed to be cooked medium but was cooked well done- not sure why they even asked.

At the end of our meal the girl from the front came over to see if I needed a box. I said yes and she said she would be right back. 20 min later- no box. I then went up front and asked her what happened to the box- She looked at me confused and then remembered she never brought one.  

If this place was busy I would understand the bad customer service- but it was so dead!

Between the burger being burnt and the terrible customer service- I was not happy about this place.
