2WjghzMpdgTTQfEM2kFb8A Great neighbourhood restaurant. The  first night I was there seemed to be packed with regulars who all knew each other. Recommendation flowed between customers at different tables with a big push for the game meats. While I wasn't 'racing' to try the horse, several other customers were recommending it.

Other great thing is they are a BYOW restaurant. They have a $25 corkage fee which is the same as their markup, as far as I can tell, on wines and they are very happy to see people bring in their own wines.

In closing, great spot and I wish it was in my neighbourhood because it place you could keeping going back to...
