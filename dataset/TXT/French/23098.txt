My first time I tried Terrace Cafe a friend and I each got a beautiful latte. We shared the florentine eggs benedict and the special lemon poppyseed french toast. As a true lover of all types of eggs benedict, the florentine was very good. The lemon poppyseed french toast was really unique and tasty. It tasted almost like lemon poppy seed bread made into french toast. Very dense and filling, but perfect with the lemon sauce. 

On my next visit I decided that it was time to accept that I have moved to the South and try the chicken and waffles... Let me just say I totally know why this is such a hit! It was absolutely AWESOME. A great combination of sweet and savory, I had to finish every last bite, because it was too good to leave on the plate. It came with a side of grits, which were buttery. To drink I got the french press coffee and a mimosa, but great additions to a wonderful meal. My friend got fried green tomatoes and the BEC Biscuit both of which were very tasty too. 

The atmosphere at Terrace is very inviting, for such a popular restaurant they are able to keep the wait minimized for the most part and it is very worth it. I have had nothing but friendly staff and service. Not too needy, but plenty attentive. If you want breakfast/brunch this is your place. I promise you will not be disappointed. Maybe I will try lunch or dinner sometime, if it is anything like their breakfast I know I won't be disappointed.
