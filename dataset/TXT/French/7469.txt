We dropped in for a mid-afternoon snack and glad we did.  The baked goat cheese app was nicely done.  The goat cheese is in a sea of rich, creamy tomatish sauce.  The garlic stick for dipping was nice and fresh but overall, wow was it rich!  Definitely a dish for sharing.
The profiteroles are disgustingly decadent.  Gobs of cream on lite fluffy rolls.  The excellent cappuchino was the perfect accompaniment.
Caution about the mid-afternoon sun though.  Even with the umbrellas, as the sun dips lower in the sky the patio can be very very hot.
