6GCbZASjMnAPYBWLc_z30g Ya know how much I despise chains so I had very low expectations of this place.. while I still don't care for cookie cutter consistency (ccc), I was surprised that my lunch was alright. I let the server order for me who's name ironically enough was Alex. She ordered me the turkey salad sandwich on raisin bread and a side salad with balsamic dressing. The salad was crisp and fresh as well as perfectly dressed. The sandwich was pretty tasty.. huge tender pieces of turkey breast dressed in a light mayo sauce with walnuts and celery. The bread was warmly toasted and slightly sweet, a perfect compliment to the savory turkey salad. 

In all, not to bad.. while I would still never go back I would have to say that Mimi's was a-okay!
