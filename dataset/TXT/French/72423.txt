XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q An unforgettable culinary journey! While dining there, you will realize how creative chefs can be. The food is truly a work of art except its edible. :) A must have when you are in Vegas. Of course, you can always fly there to eat there, which I have before while I was in LA. Now that I am in New York, I miss it dearly. It is well worth the money. Get the degustation menu and be prepare to be 1. amazed by the variety of dishes 2. be in food heaven for 4-5 hours 3. so full that you need to roll back to your hotel room because you are in a food coma. 

The staff here are amazing as well and were a pleasure to talk to. I will be back as soon as I get the chance!
