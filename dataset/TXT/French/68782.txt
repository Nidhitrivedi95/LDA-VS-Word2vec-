Have to say that I had no idea they had a limited liquor license that requires each patron to order something with a drink. And my first stop here was shortly after they opened. I don't think I could ever stop in here and not be tempted to order a couple of the small plates with my glass of wine.

The charcuterie includes some great things, the house-made pates in particular. I've always liked their pickled veg as well. But the other plates are what really shine. Among the dishes we had was the beet salad, with a nice tang of orange, and the pressed lamb - exceptional. Our favorite this time was probably the Cotechino, a surprising and rich dish with caramelized pearl onions, beef & red wine sauce, and a lobster foam that the waiter recommended.

The asparagus salad also looked great, and the guys seated next to us ordered the octopus which they generously let us sample - cooked to perfection. That'll be for our upcoming visit.

While these are small plates, they're prepared meticulously, with tremendous attention to flavor and balance. They're good, filling servings. We've always liked sitting at the bar, where we can watch the staff work their magic, and where we've always wound up talking with those seated beside us. This is one of the spots we'll be returning to during our visit.
