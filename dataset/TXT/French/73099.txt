xNnZ5ksBY1gwwTV2Btb4Ag Can't get a reservation at Pied Au Corchon? This place makes an excellent alternative! 

Fresh, well-executed dishes, manageable portions, and upscale rustic ambiance make this restaurant an good choice for out-of-town guests or (smallish) group dinners. Downsides include slowish service and a noisy dining experience.

My dinner was very tasty, and mostly worth the expense. I had the veal heart tartar, which was fresh and robust (though it could have used a pinch of something, I don't know what that something might have been). It came with thin fries, which are very thin, nicely cooked, and perfectly salted, and a finely sliced raw vegetable salad under a vinaigrette. For dessert, I shared the apple tarte for two. The tarte was nicely presented, and had slightly vinegared apple slices (a strange but unique addition) and a tiny scoop of apple sorbet (would have loved an entire dish of that!) on top as a garnish. It wasn't anything special, but it was nice and hot, with a nicely flakey crust.

Overall, as said, the place is worth the expense, and makes a great alternative to some of the more famous upscale restaurants in Le Plateau.
