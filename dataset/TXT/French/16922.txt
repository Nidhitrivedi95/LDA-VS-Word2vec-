8xCiibfgqy-8xpCWEaguqg I was craving steak for a while. And the prime rib picture on the website got me all excited. 
I ordered it medium rare , she took a sirloin. 
The steak was okay. Maybe I should have shown the picture to the lady haha . 
Nevertheless , stuffed potatoes was amazingly done 
, crispy stuff on the side and the sauce too 
Atmosphere is amazing 
I got to switch my horrible seat to a  "salon" type of one.
The Wi-Fi was great. 
I would go again to try the one on the picture . 
Lady answers well my questions regarding tender meat.
