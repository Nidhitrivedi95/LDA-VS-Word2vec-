SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ Watch your bill! Great atmosphere sat outside, food was pretty good. ordered salad and appetizer. The waitress talked me into ordering the scallop appetizer as an entrée, instead of two you can add an extra scallop to the appetizer so I ordered it. She charged me for two full appetizers at $40 instead of $19+ one scallop! then charged $7 for three asparagus. They definitely like to over charge when you're not paying attention!
