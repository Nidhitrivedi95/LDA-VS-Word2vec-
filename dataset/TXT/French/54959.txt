rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A This was an awful experience. I have been in the service industry for 8 years. The service was terrible (the kind where you want to order 3 drinks at once because you see your server so infrequently), the food was not good. We were there with 7 other people and not one of us had an enjoyable item from the menu. Glad I was there with great people because there were NO other positive things I could add.
