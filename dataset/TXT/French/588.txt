-unEKbRspO6OuEaPdmRywg Nice location and setting, but ultimately not quite worth the money. We got the tasting menu which was 6 courses and included a soup, salad, starters, main, and dessert.

While there was nothing to complain about the courses, there wasn't anything special either. The order of the items was a bit odd as a beet salad came out after the main and before the dessert. 

The service on this night was particularly slow and took about 2.5 hours for the 6 courses. Typically, it should be an hour less than that. The staff kindly discounted our aperitifs proactively which was why they got an extra star.
