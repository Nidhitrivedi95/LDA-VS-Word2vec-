jT-KFrbwr5iE-_vrVLpmiw Came in for a late lunch.
Ordered:
- 6 pastries @$6 each.
- Ashta crepe $9.
-Sharazad cocktail (gélato) $10.
- large coffee $2.50
- gourmet pita $10.

The ambiance made the food worth it.
All their sandwiches/pizza look "gourmet" and not ordinarily seen in coffee shop like Starbucks, Ikea cafétéria or Panera Bread.
Priced from $8 - $14.

The washrooms are very WHITE clean and similar to public washrooms that can be found in hotels (Le Château Frontenac without the key entry/ Skydome Hotel...etc).

It is a better place to have a cup of coffee and dessert .....over Starbucks ANYTIME!
