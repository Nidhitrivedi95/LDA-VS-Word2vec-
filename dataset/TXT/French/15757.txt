6GCbZASjMnAPYBWLc_z30g Terrible terrible service. Service slow & the place was not busy. When we finally got our food they put my cold salad on my plate with hot sandwich & French fries. When I asked server why they did this rather than put the salad on separate plate she responded "you're lucky you even got your food because our kitchen is so backed up"....We had to flag our server down for refills on water & our bill. The food is decent but this service will keep me from returning anytime soon.
