tCSlpwJQ4CZsUEMZeH2SFg My wife and I re-visited Cafe Monte on Wed. Aug. 6, 2014. We had previously given it a lackluster review, but this experience was 180 degrees different and better!  Great unhurried  service and excellent food. Even the "Wine of the Day" was good and a bargain at just $22 a bottle. My wife had the scallops and risotto (YUM!) and I had the Pork Chops with demi glasse. which was good as well. We had a BIG slice of carrot cake for dessert which was more than we could eat. 

We'll be coming back to great French food at Cafe Monte.
