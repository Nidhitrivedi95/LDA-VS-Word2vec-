0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g Very accommodating staff-had reservations for 8:30pm-we were running late and the table was not ready (restaurant was not full) but we had show tix for 10pm and the dishes started rolling out by 9pm and we were done in 28 minutes.  Happy birthday was scrawled on my dessert plate and all the dishes were hot and tasty despite the mad rush in the kitchen (I am sure).  Our main server, Robert, the French Robert was amazing and timed all our dishes perfectly.  We also had time to take photos of the million dollar artwork and was initially bummed we were not seated outside on the patio (inside with a great view) for the fountain show until we dashed outside for photos and were consistently sprayed on by the residual mist.  Would go back for leisurely dinner and try the patio seating again.  Kissed Robert on the cheeks for his great service.  Love French men.
