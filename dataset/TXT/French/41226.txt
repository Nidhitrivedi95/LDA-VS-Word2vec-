kGOr_D-LNpgZ2M9N8TT4QQ I'm quite charmed by this place. On the second floor overlooking busy (and swanky) Bloor Street, La Societe excels at every detail. A beautiful setting that exudes classic French brasserie-meet-all the deco glitz of the 20s, everything here is tempting and transportive. 

They do a wonderful, modern, fun spin on French cuisine for lunch, dinner, and best of all, brunch. In a city that loves it's brunch, La Societe is a welcome addition. The French Onion soup is decadently stuffed with carmelised onions, topped with toasted baguette and copious amounts of melted Guyere. Matched with a baby greens salad--topped with pears and a nice mustard champagne dressing made for a delicious lunch. Yes, La Societe isn't cheap, but the portions are hearty. It's a great start to a day strolling around Yorkville--where nothing, not even the window shopping, comes cheaply.
