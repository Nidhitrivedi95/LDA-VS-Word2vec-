hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA Great little spot, out of the way off the freeway. Worth giving it a shot. Hard to go if you dont work in the area. Tried the tuna sandwich based on the reviews here, wasnt too impressed, but it was still good.  Chicken pesto warm sandwich was very good. Winter soup, amazing. Illy coffee, fantastic. Service, the best.
