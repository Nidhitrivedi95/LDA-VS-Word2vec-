m9aFZk1f8tSv248YErbpQA I HEART Chez Vous.& there isn't much more to it than that. I go to Chez Vous for lunch & brunch all the time. I usually get a savory crepe of some sort & have never been disappointed. What takes Chez Vous from great to excellent is the service. I frequently bring my two little dogs with me & we eat on the patio. The wait staff provides excellent service, but they also inevitably bring a small bowl of water for my little guys, offer them some woofie love, & sometimes they bring them a little piece of chicken or bacon to snack on. It makes all the difference to me. The staff is so friendly & personable that it is like being in Europe all over again.
