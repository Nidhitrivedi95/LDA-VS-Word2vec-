F3rhQVjwggLiN4LsL2kXdQ My boyfriend and I went to Montreal over Christmas, and Bistro Florin was one of the highlights of our trip! The atmosphere was welcoming and comfortable. We shared oysters to start, which were fresh and delicious. My boyfriend had beef and I had salmon, both were cooked perfectly. It was such a wonderful and delicious experience, I suggest this place to anyone in the area looking for well prepared and flavorful French food. Great service as well!
