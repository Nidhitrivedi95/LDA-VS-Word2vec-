sphMzEIqY1I2Dzv3zLZY2g Quiet, hole-in-the-wall place near Ballantyne (in the office park near Earthfare). Restaurant is decorated fairly well considering it is in an office area, and there is a full bar.

The food is very creative - I believe the name comes from the fact the chef works in all kinds of cuisines, hence the greek appetizers, southern style pork, french-style roast chicken, etc. It is a little frenetic on the menu, but the kitchen is able to turn out lovely renditions of classic items. In particular the duck with french lentils and fig sauce is sublime. 

Desserts are good, but nothing outstanding. I would go over to Salara and finish the evening there instead (or go across the street to Vintage!)
