4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw From Wikipedia, "Snail is a common name for almost all members of the molluscan class Gastropoda that have coiled shells in the adult stage. When the word is used in a general sense, it includes sea snails, land snails and freshwater snails. Otherwise snail-like creatures that lack a shell (or have only a very small one) are called slugs."

Snails, or in the case of Mon Ami Gabi, escargot were NEVER something I thought I'd let cross my lips... until after a few too many mimosas, I got teased into ordering them here.

They were, in a single word, outstanding.  (I do suppose, however, that anything is superb when prepared with enough butter and garlic.)  

The rest of my brunch here was also spectacular but it paled in comparison to my experience trying snail.

Like everyone else said:  beautiful views of the Bellagio fountains, etc.

I will certainly return here many times.
