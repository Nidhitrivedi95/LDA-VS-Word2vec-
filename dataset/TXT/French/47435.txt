O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q I love love love Morels. It's so hard to be impressed by any restaurant really, even pricey strip restaurants but Morels gets it. Beautiful ambience, easy to access at front of casino and most importantly excellent food. By excellent I mean there was nothing served that wasn't excellent. I tried a bourbon play on a mojito with blackberry. Well done. Next their beet salad with fried cheese balls. Amazing salad. I LOVE beets and I really love the texture of fried quality cheese in a refined salad. It's been years since I've stumbled on a salad with it so this really worked for me.

Next I decided not to order a steak (it takes a LOT for a steak to impress me) and I was enjoying my experience too much to take the risk. So I ordered the braised short rib. Lets just say I was happy with my choice. Very well cooked, served with 3 different kinds of salts I can't pronounce and covered in onion and wine sauce and served over purée of pommes. Incredibly satisfying. I cleaned my plate.

I should also probably mention that the service was perfect. No fewer than 2 managers and 3 waiters checked on the quality of our experience. Honestly for $200 total (including drinks and appetizers for two) it was true value for the money and a must go for foodies who don't mind spending a bit every once in a while.
