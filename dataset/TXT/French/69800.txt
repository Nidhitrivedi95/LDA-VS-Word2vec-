WOd8tWsh2Yt_osHv-ngx_w Great little brunch place tucked away on this busy street with indoor-outdoor seating.  We walked in on a Monday morning and were seated right away.

Our waitress was darling, she was friendly, quick and helpful.

I ordered the assorted fruit waffle with English cream. What a visual and taste bud delight. Absolute spectacular in every way.

My husband ordered the crepe with Apple, bacon and cheddar. It was served with home fries and a side of fruit. The home fries were spot on for me. The crepe was not cult of tea but my husband loved it so it was a draw. 

Prices were very reasonable and we spent a lovely morning sitting on the covered patio. Highly recommend you try it for breakfast.
