EPb3FWs3mxQLUjGeMNP0SQ We were seated promptly for out 7 pm reservation. Restaurant 1/4-1/2 full. Waiter was prompt with greeting then seemed to want to get us moving. Asking bout our meal orders before our drink orders. Then once placed the meals came out way too fast - like can it be made to order?  Once meal was served the waiter became less attentive until we had to flag him down for dessert/bill. Coffee was an added thought and problem. The food was good - escargot, filet mignon and scallop risotto. Just felt the tempo was off... hurry hurry then wait
