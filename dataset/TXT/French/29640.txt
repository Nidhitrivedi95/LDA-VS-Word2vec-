FChZqoNWuLZr5Lj28Cq7yg I was surprised to read all of the positive reviews, because my experience was awful. The service was extremely slow, even though they weren't busy. There were four of us, and none of our meals was good. Poached eggs were cold and way overdone. More like hard boiled. Toast was cold, and the potatoes were under cooked and bland. And the prices are high, $4 for three pieces of bad bacon. And how do you run out of waffles?
