jaSowNITPRRCYpPb3_pjdA Im not one to give negative feedback but this was a bit disturbing. First off, i walked in and stood there for a couple minutes and not one person approached me, welcomed me, acknowledged that i was there, nor asked if I have been helped. So i was just standing there staring at the menus, and mind you i work at the hospital as a nurse so i came in and expect to get right out for a quick lunch break, but still nothing, and it wasnt at all busy.
So i approached the bar and finally made eye-contact with the bartender and said i was there for pick up. 
I received the bill $17 something. i paid with $20 and said just to keep the change. All she said was "do you atleast want the receipt?" No thank you or nothing.
Im driving and actually took a look at the bill and this is what really burst my bubble. They charged 18% gratuity ! ... for a Chicken Sandwhich! For a bill of ONE PERSON! FOR AN ORDER FOR PICK UP! Blew my mind, i have never seen any establishment charge gratuity for a one person one sandwhich take out bill. so basically i paid for TWO TIPS, in which they were actually undeserving of it given the lack of hospitality and unfriendly bartending service (blonde hair, no smile whatsoever). Im more so obligated to give 1 star on here but if it was up to me no star. Unbelievable.
