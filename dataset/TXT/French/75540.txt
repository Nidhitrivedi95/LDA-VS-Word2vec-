Ycp3Agr7dt71TZkeKV7jng Oh My God. The chocolate chip cookies at Le Gourmand are to die for. Don't order anything else (well, maybe some milk) cause these things are a meal in themselves. They are soft in the middle but crunchy on the outside and if you ever manage to get one straight out of the oven, it's like you've gone straight to heaven.

The other food is also great. They have delicious quiches with TONS of ingredients; goat cheese, red peppers, onion, mushrooms, sundried tomatoes. With a side salad it's only about $8. Their sandwiches are also sooo yummy, but if you're in a hurry, don't get them grilled. The roast beef is amazing and the proscuitto and brie will clog your arteries but fill your mouth with tastiness. They also have some more hearty meals like meatloaf and potatoes and salad or mac and cheese. However, I would avoid the Mac and Cheese, because although it's good, it'll cost you and they don't give you very much. 

The establishment itself is very nice. High ceilings, lots of light and lots of seating. They also have frozen pastas and sauces for sale, as well as some random produce and some canned beans and olives. The prices are so-so but the food is delicious. And remember, don't leave without a chocolate chip cookie!
