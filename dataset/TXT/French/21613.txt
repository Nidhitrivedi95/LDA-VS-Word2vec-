bEVWHtBRYVwqaaNF4mWNYg What an experience! Decided on Coquine for a dinner out with friends after reading reviews and was not disappointed. Great atmosphere and the food was outstanding. The French Onion Soup has been voted the #1 French Onion Soup in Toronto and it absolutely deserves that ranking. Main course was a stuffed Cornish hen and it was impeccable. Others at the table were raving about their Duck and Veal and Bouillabase. Our hostess Maria was engaging, thoughtful and courteous.  All around excellent experience at this wonderful restaurant.
