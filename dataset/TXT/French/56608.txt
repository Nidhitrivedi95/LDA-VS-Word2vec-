rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Man, I love this place.
It's the only restaurant I eat at every time I go to Vegas. I'm fixated on it for some reason.
I only eat at the bar, and I always order steak frites and a beer. I will vary the appetizer, and I usually close with Pernod or Chartreuse -- 'cause they're French -- get it?  ;)
I cannot explain why I behave so weirdly in this place, but man, I do not fight it.
Love Bouchon!
