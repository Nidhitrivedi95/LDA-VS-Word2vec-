6fPQJq4f_yiq1NHn0fd11Q Everytime I am in Vegas, this is my must have food either for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.  Depending on the time of the day, sometimes I get the savory with cheese and spinach or fresh berries.  Which ever are so good.  It's pricey, over $10 for French crepe, but then again you are in Vegas.  The portion is rather huge, be hungry when you order one or get one to share.
