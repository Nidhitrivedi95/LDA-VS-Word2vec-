A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g Our family buys numerous cakes from Manon, but recently purchased a birthday cake and it was far from what we usually expect. We buy their cakes because they are beautifully crafted and delicious. We ordered a cake a week in advance and when we went to pick up the cake the cookie that usually says happy birthday in beautiful writing was missing. They ended up putting one together last minute on two separate cookies and in horrible writing. Sad.
