The filet portion was cooked exactly as I ordered it and the lobster tail had to be a 10 Oz tail perfectly broiled. They always have fresh made bread to go with my order of the best onion soup in town. Make your way here and enjoy the best restaurant Henderson has to offer. Rhonda is our preferred server, ask for her, relax and her do her magic
