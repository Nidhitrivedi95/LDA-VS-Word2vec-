C6hljmEZYZw4pA0OJaFOjQ It's great to find an Edinburgh old favourite pop up nearly on your doorstep and whilst it might look small from the outside, the shop front opens out into a large double height "shed" at the back with retro wallpaper and even a mirror ball...


 Whatever your thoughts on the decor, the star of the show here is the food. Simple bistro food, cooked well and at incredible prices - the set dinner before 7pm is a total bargain at under £13 for two courses.


 I've eaten here 6 or so times since it opened and whilst the service can feel streatched at busy times the food has always been reliably good. Particular stars have included interesting warm salads, excellent sea bass, wonderful steak and a particularly fine Picpoul de Pinet. Desserts are maybe more ordinary but no matter as the overall picture is a very rosy one. Go.
