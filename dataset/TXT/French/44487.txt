ME6D5nLlfG0xZCtICOYDuw I am always looking for new breakfast joints in Charlotte and am often disappointed. When I found out that Georges serves brunch, I called up my friend and said we had to give it a try. We decided to meet there this morning and lets just say I am now in love....

The restaurant is adorable. There are photos from Vogue all over the walls, my inner fashionista was screaming. We sat down and were greeted by our very friendly waiter. I ordered a cup of coffee and was pleasantly surprised to find that it was really delicious and actually pretty strong. 

We started with the beignets which were very fluffy and very delicious. We quickly scarfed those down and placed our order for Steak and Eggs Filet Mignon and I am very, very happy I did. 

The steak and the eggs were perfectly cooked. The steak was rare and incredibly flavorful and the eggs were perfectly poached. The hollandaise was some of the best I have ever had. The potatoes on the side weren't the best I've ever had, that would be my only complaint. 

In addition to the fantastic food, our waiter was incredible. I never saw the bottom of my coffee cup or water glass. He gave us suggestions of what to order and when we told him it was our first time dining at Georges, he brought us the dinner menu so we could take a look and see if we wanted to come back for dinner some time. I was very, very pleased with the service and the food. I plan to go back soon for dinner and of course, for brunch.
