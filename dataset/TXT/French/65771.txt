uBXEI3Vq8ZSQkhkgN5z6aQ Super cute classic French style bistro with wonderful prix fixe that is just spectacular.  We walked in late the day after Xmas and they were kind enough to seat us and offer some of the best service I've had in a restaurant.  The server was incredibly sweet, kind, funny, generous, and patient.  We ordered the beef and duck breast, and both were made to absolute perfection. Their poutine is small but exquisite.  Bring your bottle of wine and enjoy it with your meal, with no corkage fee.  Lovely, relaxing, classic.
