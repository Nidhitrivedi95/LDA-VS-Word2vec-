There are 6 bistro table seating 2 each and space for 4 more at the bar which overlooks the kitchen.  All this in a space about the size of a single car garage.  And since you're sharing the same room as the kitchen expect to go home smelling like the food.  
OK, so it's small but the food makes it all worth it.  I had the duck pizza which comes with an apple demiglace on a wonderful crust.  My companion had dijon tilapia.  Both were outstandingly tasty.  
If you're someone who prefers a hole in the wall with excellent food this one is worth the trip.  But with seating for only 12 - 16 people, make reservations well in advance.
