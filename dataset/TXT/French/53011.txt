QeFsIMcIFIJcOrpthYL8jg Ordered spaghetti al dente - the pasta came broken into 4 inch pieces & sticky hard?!?!  4 days ago we went with friends for a birthday celebration & ordered the lamb burger which by law should be well cooked - it came pink in the middle.  The plate arrives hot to touch but the food is lukewarm.  Been a patron for over 10 years & when the regular staff - Lorenzo, Rodwan are working they make sure that the plates don't look like fast food & replace the dish immediately.   Last night was a waste of money. Needless to say chef should be doing a better job & the staff should be more involved.  Elena Miller. 

Heard Lorenzo was back at work so we decided to go for a quick bite. Kitchen staff still needs work - but it was great to have Rodwan wait on us & to glad see Lorenzo.  The atmosphere is back to normal. My husband enjoyed his lamb burger & I had the fish.  Next time I'll order the pasta again.  The music was fabulous.  Thank you for a great night.
