xcmmTXhuMx2fZF2Bt69F4w I have no complaints about Point Brugge except for the long wait, which is something I knew about when I decided to eat there. And if the food had NOT been worth the wait, I would have docked Point Brugge a star, but it was absolutely worth the wait. 

I visited Point Brugge with my boyfriend and another couple and everything was delicious, from the Brugge frites with basil mayonnaise to the chocolate sauce on the French vanilla ice cream we had for dessert. My boyfriend had the steak, cooked perfectly, and the Brugge frites. We can no longer get fries anywhere without him talking incessantly about the basil mayonnaise at Point Brugge. The other two at the table had the mussels and some beef dish in a gravy with the frites. I don't remember what it was called but I had a bite and it was delicious. I had the macaroni and cheese and grilled cheese (yes, I'm a child) and they were good too. 

Everything was delicious, service was attentive, and I will be back, though maybe on a Tuesday right as it opens to avoid the long wait.
