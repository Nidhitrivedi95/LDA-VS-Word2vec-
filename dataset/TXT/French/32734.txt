h_ypoQ2rmwX8UGSmohsGiQ Delicious lattes and oh my wow, the croissants - one of the best I've had in the city! Decor was cute, very south of France-y and communal tables had ample space and outlets, if need be.  For lunch, I had the cold cut ham and cheese on a baguette and it was great. Next time, I have to try the salads! Can't wait to revisit :)
