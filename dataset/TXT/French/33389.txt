hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA All you need is an excuse to come here.  Which is exactly how I found myself here this morning.  I had a doctor's appt around this area, so I made sure I stopped by.  Yes folks, it is a little bit out of the way, but so worth it.  I envy those that can come here to get their cup of Joe and yummy eats here easily.  

I came here because Jesse N said that this place was sooo my flavor.  I'm so lucky to have him because he was right, this is so my type of cafe!  

Oliver takes all the time to give you exceptional service, and he will go out of his way to impress you.  Call you by name, make sure he answers any of your questions, he'll have a chat with you if he can, make recommendations, you name it, he goes above and beyond!

I tried the Eggplant panini, and it was super super SUPER delish.  I was planning on adding meat, but forgot to because I was indecisive and holding up the line.  However, when I did get to chow down my panini, I think I seriously finished it in a few big bites, I really didn't even need the meat.  

I was running late for work and figured I would also get a pastry for my Admin for covering me and one for myself too. Lucky me they had Chocolate croissants and Raisin Croissants fresh out of the oven, and yes I got both.  Ssshhh but I totally did not give the other pastry to my admin...oink oink to me.  

I'm definitely a fan!
