dW9cPsvOGwlOpiz3wEBgiQ I was enchanted buy this restaurant. The place is in front of the water in a very small community that resembles a small town in Italy.
The food was incredible! I started with the escargots, bathed in a garlic and butter sauce, with some parsley and other spices. They were so yummy and light! Then I had the Ahi Tuna over vegetables, TO DIE FOR! it was perfect and finished the meal with a chocolate cake that I will never be able to have it again because I think i gained 10 pounds since then.
Love the place, the Chef came over the table and check on our food to make sure we were 100% happy, and took a photo with him.
Will try to post the photo.
Overall everything was superb!
