jLxeBgWhLRbII2ACkgH1Sg I went here today for brunch, and I loved it!

I've had kouign aman, and my mom had a plain croissant and some brewed coffee. We both were amazed how our pastries tasted so good coupled with amazing textures. The kouign aman was crispy on the outside and chewy inside, while the croissant was very flaky! The coffee also satisfied my mom's taste for a good dark brew. 

Only negative point- I did not find their staff friendly. 

Highly recommend this place and will visit more frequently :)!
