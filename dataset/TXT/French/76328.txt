This was the best meal of my trip! We tried:
the Wasabi bloody mary (very flavorful not too much heat), 
regular bloody mary (also great), 
the duck hash and eggs (awesome, loved the flaky pastry hidden underneath),
whole wheat pancakes with blueberries (so so buttery, really delicious)
a side of assorted pastries (a cinnamon flaky pastry, a mini chocolate chip muffin, and one other thing that my companions ate up before i could try it)
Every bite made me happy! I really loved sitting outside also. It is a beautiful setting. 
Yes, it's expensive, but what isn't expensive in Las Vegas.  I had this brunch 3 days ago and I'm still thinking about it. Go here!
