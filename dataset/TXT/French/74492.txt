xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g Incredible experience! We reserved a table and was shown to probably the best table in the restaurant. We over looked the Bellagio water show and had great food. 

The service was way above par and the setting was romantic. I scored a lot of points with the wife on this date.
