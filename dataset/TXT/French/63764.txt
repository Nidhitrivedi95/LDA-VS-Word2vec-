T4g4k2OhCTsiqcP-ZXElHQ I was looking for a decent French Bistro on Queen West and thanks for fellow Yelpers, I discovered Jules. I tried their Prix Fixe menu. 3 courses for $25. I ordered caesar salad, steak and frites and Crème brûlée. I wasn't really impressed with the salad and my friends who ordered French onion soup weren't impressed either. It was a miss. But the rests were amazing. I ordered a medium steak and it exceeded my expectation! It was very juicy, tender and full of flavours. If you love mayo, ask them for it. Their mayo's very tasty too. Their Crème brûlée was pretty good as well, my only complaint was the portion. I'm a big fan of steak and frites and it was my fav in Toronto by far. Way better than Celestine's, which was my previous favourite. I love the place. It's small but cozy and I love their open kitchen. I'll revisit to try their chicken dish and other desserts for sure!
