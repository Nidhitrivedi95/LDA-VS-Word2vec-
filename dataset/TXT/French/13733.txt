4O8fzz9F-XEsQ-gTMgkiyQ Yet another fantastic and decadent meal in old Montreal. We started with an anchovies pie - so different and delicious. I had a perfectly grilled cod fillet on a bed of the yummiest spicy chorizo and sun dried tomatoes on risotto.  My boyfriend had fisherman's stew - which had a ton of seafood in a beautiful broth. We were completely satisfied, and impressed with the originality of each dish.  We also liked how relatively inexpensive the meal was. There was no wait, but it was obvious the rest of the patrons were enjoying their meals also. I am glad we didn't wait in line somewhere else.
