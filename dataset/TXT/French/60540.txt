We were very unhappy with the fried oysters. There was too much heavy batter and some blobs didn't even have any oysters in them. The waitress did take the order off of our bill. None of us were blown away with our meals. Pretty standard fair and rather high prices. With so many great restaurants in Madison, I doubt I'd go to Sardine again.
