Xw50tINqzrI_BM_x7_IcZA Having been to the Yorkville location, I was pleasantly surprised to find another Go Go in the city! 

Same concept and menu as their original store - crepes (savory and sweet), omelettes and salads. All the people who work there are from France so you feel the vibe of being in France. Their crepes are made to order so you're getting a fresh one. I had the chocolate crepe with bananas ($6) today, but picked up a bottle of Limonana to go. There are a couple of tables so eating-in is an option.

Looking forward to see more Go Go's in the city !
