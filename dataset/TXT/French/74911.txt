xYy54Y2VTBAG5k7WJcaH4A Our meal was fabulous!  From the escargot to the faux gras as starters, to our main courses of lobster over risotto and the duck confit, everything was prepared perfectly. We finished we a mixed berry parfait, light and tasty. The service was attentive and the personal engagement of owner/manager indicates how it all comes together. When he visited our table he knew everything we had ordered and asked about each dish. This was a great find for us. We will soon be regulars.
