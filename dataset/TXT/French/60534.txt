SBnpT6JDbah-5l_52GM5sw Sardine may be one of my favorite restaurants in Madison.  The cuisine is always exciting to me.  I'm always intrigued by how they choose to pair and complement ingredients.  Every time I read the menu at this place, I rarely find any of the descriptions truly appetizing, but when the dish is front of me, it's delicious.  I am always pleasantly surprised at how they manage to transform my meh feelings into genuine "going to finish this dish even if I'm stuffed" excitement.
