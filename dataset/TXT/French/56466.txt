rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I am a big fan of Thomas Kellar.

Bouchon in Vegas is not comparable to the one in Yountvile,CA and I wonder why...

But otherwise, Menu is the same and Here's my reiview:

Decoration: Nice and big outdoor seating area near the pool

Food: Little bit on the saltier side 

Service: Excellent!
