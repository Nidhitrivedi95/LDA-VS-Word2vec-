QeFsIMcIFIJcOrpthYL8jg Food: The food was alright, nothing mind-blowing. 

Service: Can be slow on weekends

Value: On the pricey side but within the normal limits of Old Port restaurants

Ambiance: The restaurant has 2 floors, there is a live jazz band upstairs at night which is nice if you don't mind it being too loud although it might be hard to hear conversation. The light is also too dim to my taste.
