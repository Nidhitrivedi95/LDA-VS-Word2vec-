XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q I can't bring myself to give this place more than 3 stars.

The food was fantastic.  Perfectly cooked, well seasoned/aged and delicious.

The service was good, but, being trained in front of the house for high end restaurants, I can't help but take notice of some glaring mistakes.  Ones that wouldn't bother me if we were having a $150 pp meal... But at $400~ pp I expect perfection.  While training, my professor said, that the course would ruin many of my dining experiences, and well... This is one of them... 

Examples:  I asked a server/back server for more bread - #1 I should have been offered more bread, I should not have had to ask.  #2 "No Problem" - My training has taught me to hate that phrase... When was it ever a problem? #3 When we got our first order of bread, they took it back into the kitchen to heat, so we had warm, tasty breads to enjoy, upon our second and third orders, the bread was not heated, and was cold.  Where is the consistency?

Next was the atmosphere: It was great... Modern French... Reminded me of some of the wineries and French country houses I've dined at in that part of the world. But there were the table mats...  The goddamned table mats, while very pretty were painful... Made of this hard plastic substance... They were pokey and went the length of the table... Had I been wearing a sports coat, I may not have noticed, but it's Vegas, Summer's beginning and it's 90 degrees outside... And the restaurant seems to have a casual "don't dress like an asshole" dress code, so I was wearing a short buttoned up shirt.  And the mats were relentless like wasps into my arms...

Well, that's my rant...

All in all, I did really enjoy our experience... It would have been very hard to complain about if I hadn't ruined future dining experiences by studying the subject.  And I feel bad about rating only 3 stars, but at the price point, I feel like everything should be perfect.
