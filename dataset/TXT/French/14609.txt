5EIuCcoHY2evAhFMBV6G6g Before this dinner we popped into La Cave and maybe my taste buds were on the high from the fresh food but when we got here for dinner I was disappointed. 
The decor was very typical and nothing to write home about. Our waitress didn't seem that on "her game" that evening - forgetting specials and how things are prepared that are on the menu everyday. Food was just ok - i have had a steak much better prepared than this one.
