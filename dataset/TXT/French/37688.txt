jalA5zHW8ZfY3RSPG7oDxQ I was looking for a lovely dining experience without cutting a huge hole in pocket...and Cafe Du Jour gave me just that...the server was polite and very helpful with the menu...he seated is outside and on few occasions when it rained was prompt and kind enough to switch our tables back and forth...the food was delicious...lot of flavor and very well cooked and beautifully presented...it was a memorable night and I certainly see myself coming back to this place again and again...!!
