jA3xcba82t8x06H8NzG4VQ This is the same great food with the same melt-in-your-mouth braised pork belly, that ended up in my belly, and with the same degree of satisfaction as before. This is just a block away or two maybe from the previous location, except the place is just bigger and better with twice the fun. We had the bahn mi, braised short rib and the burger -- all very worth the visit.
