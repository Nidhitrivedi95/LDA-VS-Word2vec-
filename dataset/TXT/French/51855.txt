pmoIMK8zGWvKsVOPDBYfzg Short and sweet review. As a local...To Die For! Love this place. The quality of the food coming out of the kitchen is amazing. We usually get a romantic booth and are served by the most hospitable staff.

People like "1 Star Calvin" would not know a quality restaurant if it bit them in the ass.

I could go on and on, but I am short on time tonight. Six stars for me!!!
