KRgTdfs4oVFUcATMfAoR4A We went to Vertige for New Year's Eve and did their New Year's Eve tasting menu which consisted of the following: (excuse my rough English translations-this is what I understood the dishes to be generally)

-Amuse Bouche 
(Oyster Tartare with caviar)

-VELOUTÉ DE CÈPES FAÇON CAPPUCCINO-Arancini de risotto aux cèpes
(Cream of Mushroom Soup with foam and Fried Black Truffle Risotto Balls)

(Sea Scallop Mousse with Caviar)
 
-LE FOIE GRAS DE CANARD AU TORCHON MAISON-Chutney de figues séchées confites au porto, pain brioché grillé 
(Foie Gras with Fig Chutney and Brioche Toast)

-LE PAVÉ DE BAR DU CHILI RÔTI-En croûte de chorizo et d'oignons confits, brandade croustillante Jus de viande réduit au porto
(Chilean Sea Bass with Mashed Potatoes two ways- fried and regular)
 
-LES JOUES DE VEAU DE LAIT BRAISÉES- Sauce Madère à la truffe, mousseline de céleri-rave Fricassée de champignons et haricots verts 
(Veal Cheeks with Mashed Potatoes)
 
-LE FONDANT AU CHOCOLAT-Glace au caramel à la fleur de sel, tuile de cacao 
(Chocolate Lava Cake with Salted Caramel Ice Cream)

I love seafood but the oyster and the sea scallop mousse were a little overly fishy for me.  Both were presentations of the seafood that I've never had before though so it was still pretty fun to try.

The mushroom soup and the fried black truffle risotto balls were amazing.  The soup warmed me up and the flavor of the soup and the risotto balls were perfectly seasoned. If you like mushrooms and risotto at all, you will love this dish.

The foie gras was good but not spectacular. It was a generous portion though and 4 slices of brioche toast was provided.

I really enjoyed the Chilean sea bass and the veal cheeks.  The sea bass had a great firm texture and the veal cheeks were very tender.  I thought there was a little too much mashed potatoes going on, even though it was done well.

As for dessert, I absolutely loved the chocolate lava cake and salted caramel ice cream.  The lava cake comes in a very hot cup so be careful not to burn yourself.  This was my favorite part of the meal and I was scraping out all the chocolate by the end, even though I had been overly full 2 courses earlier.

Overall, I enjoyed my meal and it was bang for your buck at 5 courses + amuse bouche for $59 and $10 more if you got the foie gras.  I think I just expected a bit more for one of the top French restaurants listed on Trip Advisor, and for French food in Montreal.

P.S. I believe that many of these dishes are on their regular menu as well, so find which ones interest you and check to see if they're on the menu!
