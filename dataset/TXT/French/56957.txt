rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Honestly it's just fine. I would not go back here again unless someone really insisted and paid for it. The food is fine, the service is fine. But nothing is great EXCEPT the bread and dessert! So yes, I am not a fan as I just didnt think the food had much flavor. But the desserts were great so I give it 4 stars. Overall I say 3.5 stats ... whatever that means to you. YMMW.
