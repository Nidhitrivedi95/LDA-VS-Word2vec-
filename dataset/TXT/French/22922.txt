bzbNGyrTwWHAgg1CqkSgeg The first time I came here, it was for a Yelp event and at the time I felt the restaurant was five star potential. The service was on point and the food was good. However upon revisiting the restaurant a few weeks later, I can't say I can stand by that initial review. I think the first time I was there the restaurant was ready and was in stage. They had everything prepared. But that's not the way life is. My blended review would be to say the restaurant is a three star. I say that because on top of the wait, it took us forever to get our food. We sat there for 40 minutes with no food in sight. When the food did come out, the avocado put on one of the plates for garnish was rotten. Most of our food were luke warm and the service just want present. I might try this place again but not anytime soon.
