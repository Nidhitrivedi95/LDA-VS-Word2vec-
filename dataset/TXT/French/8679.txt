4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I was very disappointed with both the service and food of this restaurant. My friends and I were celebrating birthdays and decided to dine at Mon Ami Gabi. We were seated and "greeted" by a rude server. I don't like to accuse anyone of being racist; however my friends and I (African American females) are being treated like we're being an inconvenience, but the rest of the tables in our section (all Caucasian) are getting top notch service, one would assume that she was. After speaking to the manager, we were greeted with a new server Tracy. Tracy was informative, pleasant and definitely made up for our 1st server. The food was not the best. The chicken breast and lentils were too bland for my liking. Needless to say, I will never return to this restaurant, but I appreciate Tracy's awesome attitude.
