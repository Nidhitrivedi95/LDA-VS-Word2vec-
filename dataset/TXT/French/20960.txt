AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw Just got back from Paris and have been missing the crepes. I usually go to Crepe Expectations in Henderson - yup, I pretty much travel all over the valley for good eats - but, wanted to try Payard based on reviews and they use buckwheat crepes like in Paris (crepe expectations uses more of an egg based crepe, still delicious, just different). Overall, Payard makes a good crepe, but strip crowds are not my friend, though it usually doesn't bother me, on this Sunday there was a convention in full swing, I waited in line bout 15 minutes to order and then, they mentioned crepes were busy so, there was a 20 minute wait. The upside, at least protocols call for mentioning the wait/backup. I thought that was nice.

I ordered the Crepe Madame, sans the ham, which leaves cheese and egg for $10.50. It was good but I wish they had more topping options especially if you are holding the meat.

Bottom-line, I am glad I tried it, but, probably won't go back unless I am already in Ceasar's and hungry.
