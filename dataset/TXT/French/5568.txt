Our food took a really long time to arrive, due to the fact that one lady was serving both outdoor patio and indoor customers and the food was nothing really to write home about. I ate there about a month ago and I can't recall any of the dishes that I got which is not to say that it was bad, but really just to say that nothing made a lasting impression. In fact, I'm still thinking about that Tapas place as I'm writing this.
