T4shscbr3BU3yb6EA3BSfA Wow----we are from one of the world's restaurant capitals---San Francisco, where great food is the norm.  Well, Les 400 Coups is something special and would rank in the best in any world city.  

A beautiful and intimate spot with specially friendly and helpful service, the dishes were to moan about.  We tried a few selections and were consistently overwhelmed by the rich mixture of flavors in every dish.  Not sure how they were able to blend so many unique flavors, but we were thankful to have had the opportunity.
