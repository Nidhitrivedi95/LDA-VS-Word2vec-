t5QPwHMuPQn_kN809Ir6TQ I definitely recommend coming here if you're in the Lake Las Vegas area.  This is a cozy Cafe located by the lake serves fresh baked pastries and an array of sweet crepes, savory and hot sandwiches, along with other dishes like salad.  The food is delicious and well worth it!  We ordered a several dishes which were all very satisfying. The bacon on the galette was nice and crispy.  The croissants were buttery and flaky. I really enjoyed the almond and chocolate croissant.  Overall had a pleasant experience. My only concern was that the door was open and there were flies in the cafe. There should be a way to cover the pastries so they don't get contaminated. There's outside seating but the flies were flying all over.
