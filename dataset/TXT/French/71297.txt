xcmmTXhuMx2fZF2Bt69F4w My partner and I went to Point Brugge Cafe a few weeks ago and we are still thinking about it, which says a lot. We thoroughly enjoyed our experience there.

We got there around 7:30pm on the weekend, so we expected a wait. When we walked in, there were a lot of people standing around the bar waiting for a table and was pretty noisy due to the size of the restaurant/number of people there. We put our names in and were given an hour wait estimate. We ordered a couple glasses of wine, a red blend (i think) and a sauvignon blanc. The white was better than the red. About 30 minutes later, our table was ready.

STARTER
Small mussels in a white wine sauce

Verdict: the mussels were perfect! I am not usually a fan, but decided to give them a try (when in a Belgium restaurants...) and I'm so happy I did. I can't wait to go back to try other sauces. They provide more sauce than other restaurants. This was a pleasant surprise and went well with the bread they served, which was decent but not great.

ENTREE
My partner and I both had the Carbonnade Flamande, which if you haven't had that before is a beef roast with a delicious gravy. This was cooked perfectly, super tender and the vegetables were also so good! This is a big dish, especially after starting with the mussels. I was able to save some for lunch the next day and it was just as good! Highly recommend this as well.

DESSERT
We didn't have room this time around unfortunately.

OVERALL
I really like this place. It's small and reminded me of the vibe in many NYC restaurants.  Unfortunately, the price point is a not one that will allow me to go weekly, but it is definitely worth every penny. I will definitely be back and can't wait to try other items on the menu!
