kGOr_D-LNpgZ2M9N8TT4QQ The restaurant was beautiful, but we were surprised it was no where near full for a Friday night.  Even though it wasn't full, the service was a bit absent at times. Our server got bread to our table about 30 seconds before out soup got there. The food was so so. We enjoyed our cocktails, but the mussels, and French onion soup were not winning us over with their flavour.  Will not be going back for dinner, but maybe for cocktails.
