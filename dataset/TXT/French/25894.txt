Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA After rave yelp reviews we decided to make a visit. I can say the view is nice. I liked the bar area out front when arriving. The decor inside was nice as well. I honestly did not care for one food item that we ordered, except my husbands steak was good. Also, the view is nice but I will take the Paris Eiffel tower restaurant over this. All and all I was expecting more. Service was good in the beginning and then sort of fizzled out in the end.
