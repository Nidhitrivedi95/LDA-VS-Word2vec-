XKPosZx2j4RHcZ8Ewdwj0A My experience at Leméac was almost perfect... 

The atmosphere was great, we had a reservation (thank god! We arrived at 8pm on a Sunday and the place was packed) but were lucky enough to have a table on their covered patio. 

Our server was extremely professional yet friendly, knew the menu well and was able to recommend a good wine alternative (they ran out of our first choice). 

The food was extremely pleasing: we shared the foie gras and the tuna tartare (special of the day) appetizers and then had the filet mignon and scallops. Although everything was delicious, the tartare was to die for (perfect balance of flavours and textures!) - I would go back just to taste that tartare again!!

So far, so good... but our experience was tinted when at the end of the meal (the restaurant was now almost empty) a small group of 6 people sat right next to us and were extremely unpleasant and loud... while this is not the staff's fault per se (although they could have been seated elsewhere), we were very unpleased with the way the situation was handled. My partner commented to a waiter (ours was busy with other tables) that we were dissappointed that the recently seated table next to us was being so loud and that we were hoping to have a coffee/desert (I.e. ready to spend more money in the establishment); instead of simply kindly offer us to be moved further away or inside the restaurant (now empty as mentionned earlier) the server replied that we were being difficult and that 6 people doesn't make for a loud group; making us feel bad for the situation... after a $200+ meal for 2 people, it wasn't quite the costumer service I was hoping for. We left and had coffee elsewhere.
