cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg I'll admit that I also found out about this place through Anthony Bourdain's book and travel show (see link below), then reading up about it on eGullet, finally went a few years ago and have been back many times since.

The sugar shack decor is a bit odd at first if you're expecting your typical fine dining restaurant, but with the food (and portions) they serve, it makes sense and really works - not just a gimmick.

The chef, Martin Picard - who with his various new enterprises, TV show, etc. doesn't work the line as much as he used to, focuses on two things on the menu - pork and foie gras - there's a lot of pork and a lot of foie gras.  This is not vegan country.

All the foie gras dishes work, if you plan on only going once, go for their now oft copied dish, foie gras poutine - a high end take on a traditional  quebecois (junk food) dish.  Pass on the foie gras burger.

Be warned, as you'll see in the video, the portions are huge.
