YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g One of the best restaurants ive eaten at in Vegas. I was fortunate enough to try a variety of things from Fluer and everything i tried was spectacular. The staff, including the chefs, make sure to come out and introduce themselves and make sure everything is on point. Ive never eaten octopus and they serve a barbecue octopus that is splendid. Highly recommend this place!
