OYHpqY6-3C-wXR-uPbHhwA We had to run to this side of town today, August 19, for errands. Not sure where to eat, we popped into this small restaurant. The pastries looked yummy but we were looking for lunch. We decided to stay. My husband and I started out with the home made soup French onion soup. It was yummy. It had a very dark broth but was not salty. Really tasty. On the way out, the chef gave us a sample of the potato leek soup he had just made. Even better. I loved the fact that you could feel the texture of the potatoes in the soup. My husband had a brisket sandwich---it was very tender and tasty. I had their special burger with jalapeno cheese and carmelized onion. I opted out of the bacon and bbq sauce (which was very good as I tried some from the brisket sandwich). Again, very good. They were out of fries so I was offered potato salad or home fries. All I can say is that I hope the next time I am there they are out of fries, again. The home fries were outstanding. Our server was a very pleasant and helpful young man. He kept our drinks filled and was never far away. This is truly a little gem. The chef was very pleasant and can really cook!
