w2tr0PA0b3tg8pId0kjM-A I feel so guilty eating their desserts because they are just so BEAUTIFUL! But I quickly overcome that guilt because they are equally delicious. I admit, I do take photographs of the dishes I order when I go out occasionally, but it becomes a complete abomination to not photograph these desserts before eating them because they are so beautiful! I really enjoy the complexities of the desserts too - each dessert that I have had here is magnificent in texture, flavor and complexity. You really can't go wrong here!
