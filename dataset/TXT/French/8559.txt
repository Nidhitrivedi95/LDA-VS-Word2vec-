4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I've only been here once and I thought it was okay, my husband absolutely loved it though, so it really depends on your taste. The restaurant can be a little pricey but the quality of the food is worth it. The fries are amazing! The restaurant it's self is a little busy, but very distinct in style. Its personally not my type of restaurant/food preference but I would recommend it.
