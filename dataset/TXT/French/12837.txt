4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Came here on either my second or third day in Las Vegas.  Was looking for something light while I boozed prior to going out that night.  We sat outside watching the traffic on the strip and across the street with the fountain.  Temps were pretty cool outside that evening for how hot it was in the afternoon, obviously being assisted with artificially cooled air.  Beyond the comfortable people watching, we had a few glasses of wine and then I made the french onion soup with gruyere and the tomato salad with Roquefort my dinner choices for the evening.

Got exactly what I expected, a quick light bite to eat prior to getting started with more spirited drinking.  I think everyone else enjoyed their food for the most part.  Would definitely stop back again, as it's pretty cheap for the strip in reality and pretty inline with a lot of other comparable options along this block or three.
