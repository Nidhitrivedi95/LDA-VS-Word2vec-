Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA Actually four and a half stars

Georg and I like to drop a few hundred dollars on at least one dinner extravaganza every time we make it to Vegas.  We like to choose restaurants with some kind of view, and this one was AWESOME.  walking through the bar area to the restrooms was amazing, I've never seen the strip like that and I have been to Vegas at least 25 times.

My parents are all about the platinum cards EVERYWHERE so I'm all about the free rooms for me and my friends, which means that it's ok to spent almost half a thousand dollars on the grand tasting menu here for two.

Some things to note:

DRESS nicely.  We sat there for about 4 hours or so, and saw people get turned away and make a fuss, but we also saw that the people who were dressed nicely; i.e. dresses and dress shirts + ties were seated next to the windows and the people who were dressed so so were seated in the back, or under the stair case.

ORDER the floating island dessert.  this is the best dessert I have ever had.  Georg says its the second best dessert he's every had (first best at chez TJ)  I love desserts that aren't so sweet.  He loves desserts that are sweeeeeeeet.  This was perfect.  It was sweet, savory, creamy and fresh, and light. PERFECTION.

The minus .5 stars comes from the small amount of leg room under our two person booth, slighty weird "children of the corn" type bus boy with the glazed look, and the fact that when our server asked how the food was and we said "great!...blahblahblah awesome!" he walked away saying "yessss" under his breath and gave a little mini fist pump.
