qmh6zxtJ8C8-YiUPv7ySlw Came here for dinner with one thing in mind, the famous DB Burger! ($32, 9oz beef patty stuffed with foie gras and braised shortribs - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/qmh6zxtJ8C8-YiUPv7ySlw?userid=F_5_UNX-wrAFCXuAkBZRDw)  I've been reading rave reviews about it on Yelp so I had to try it.  Didn't even bother looking at the rest of the menu, though I'm pretty sure everything else is really good.  So yeah, laugh it up that I paid $32 for a burger.  I'm not ashamed, it was so good!!  Burger, fries, and a glass of Muscata....the perfect dinner!  The restaurant itself is really nice inside.  I love how you have an open and up close view of that huge waterfall show outside the Wynn.  The shows were trippy though, but they helped enhanced the ambiance of the place.  I also had a very good waiter.  I liked how he guaranteed that my muscato would be very delicious or else he'd drink it himself if I didn't like it.  I had to apologize to him because I liked it.  Nice overall dining experience for me and I would definitely come here again to try their other entrees.
