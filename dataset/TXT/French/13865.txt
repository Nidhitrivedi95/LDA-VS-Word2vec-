50-xiTYmE6NERi-yJ6NvHw Before seeing the Pet Shop Boys Supertour (which was, by the way, FANTASTIC), we decided to do dinner right across the Sony Center. I felt like French food, so Biff's fit the bill for that type of cuisine and with a great ambiance to match. 

Service is really good here. Like really good in the very attentive, but not overbearing kind. Food, on the other hand, is so-so.

My dad said everything was just overly salty - the frog leg appetizer, the fois gras, his Beef Borguignon. The mushroom soup was the same one you get at O&B so nothing different there.
My Quenelle basically was bread.

My mom, on the other hand, really enjoyed her Duck Confit and my husband had a very nice, tender piece of steak.

The Lemon Tart was nice and refreshing and the Madelines...well, nothing can ever compare to those from Café Boulud.

Would I come back here again? Don't think so...unless it's for drinks (Sunday is half-priced bottle of wines!!) and nibbles. But the overall ambiance and the service were great.
