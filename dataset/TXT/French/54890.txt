rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I had to reduce my rating from 5 stars to 4 stars due to the inconsistent service that we had.  On our first visit, we had the nicest server and felt like royalty!  She was kind and had the best service.  We are a group so we asked for separate bills and she gladly separated our bills.  I had the Breakfast Americaine, which came with a pastry which was all delicious.  I got the cheese danish, but I liked the chocolate almond croissant much better (it had almond paste in the middle).  We came back 2 days later for Sunday brunch because we enjoyed our experience so much.  Our server was Amber C, who barely smiled and made us feel like we were bothering her.  When we told her that we wanted separate bills shortly after we received our coffees, she gave us a frown and some attitude at how she has to figure out who's drink is who's.  Wow, sorry for making your life so complicated.  After she processed our bills, she didn't even bother to give the credit cards to the correct person, she simply laid it on the table all in a little pile.  I have never experienced that EVER at any restaurant in my entire life.  I guess we were really bothering her by dining there.  Too bad there is a mandatory 20% gratuity for large groups because she definitely did not deserve it plus she had soured my opinion of Bouchon. If we had another excellent server, I would have made my rating 5 stars for sure.
