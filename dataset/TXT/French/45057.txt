mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q It was a last minute decision for dinner here at L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon. My boyfriend wanted to treat me out to a nice dinner but we also wanted to save some money. The Joel Robuchon restaurant next door is really expensive, so this was a great alternative! 

The decor of the restaurant was beautiful- very clean and modern. I love the combination of red and black, so the colors of the restaurant was nice. We chose to sit at the bar so we can see all the kitchen action. It was like being in Hell's Kitchen without Gordon Ramsay screaming and yelling at the chefs. 

We both chose Menu A for $78/person. You get to choose 2 appetizers, 1 entree, and 1 dessert per person. This is a prix fixe menu and selections vary by season, so my review of the dishes are probably no longer served here.

Amuse-Bouche: comes with every prix fixe; a tiny foam dish that cleans your palate.
Complimentary bread and butter- freshly made! Yummy croissants!
Appetizers: I had the raw white fish carpaccio in sesame oil and greens which was refreshing. I also had the asparagus foam soup which was strange to me. My BF had the duck pot stickers and gnocchi. Everything was beautifully plated and looked perfect!
Entrees: I had the pork belly with seasoned cabbage; it was so good! My BF had the duck breast which was so tender; you wouldn't even believe it was from a duck! Complimentary pommes puree (mashed potatoes).
Dessert: I had a gorgeous plate of coffee ice cream, truffle, chocolate cookies, and chocolate. My BF had a passion fruit panna cotta.

The chefs really know how to make the dishes look like art. It was definitely a great experience! The waiter was really professional and the food was exquisite! 

I knocked off 1 star because it literally took half an hour for each dish to come out! I think I sat for a total of two hours.
