-Mz3M0g6iFZczs6a7ddf5g We probably had the best meal of our lives here! We started with the Vichyssoise which was absolutely incredible. Then we had the Octopus which was also delicious (I preferred the first, but my fiancé preferred this dish) and then had the freshest pasta dishes! It tasted as if the pasta was rolled out specifically for us. We finished our meal with the tiramisu. Every single dessert sounded fabulous. As a nut allergy sufferer, I rarely get to pick from the full dessert menu, so it felt great to get to pick from 5-6 choices! Overall, awesome food, great service and cool ambiance. Would love to come back!
