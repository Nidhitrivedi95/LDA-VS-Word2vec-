rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw Very nice expensive French restaurant at the Aria.  Even the cheapest steak ($49 flat iron) is exquisite -- they clearly make use of sous vide to get a butter texture out of the meat.  I liked the brandy-peppercorn sauce, though it wasn't the best one I've had.  I almost wish I hadn't let the waiter convince me to get that instead of the blue cheese fondue.
 
The frites that accompany the steak were good, but a little salty and a little oily.  I did like the crispness and lack of starchiness.  The lobster bisque was very good as was the bread & butter on the table.  The bread is a french sourdough and the butter is smooth, spreadable, and the right temperature.

Service was good, but not fast even after we told them some members of our party were going to a show.  

All in all a good and expensive meal.
