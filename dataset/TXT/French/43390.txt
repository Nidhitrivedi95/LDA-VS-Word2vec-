LtDYRcMJbJPhXPEklT29Fw This restaurant and the staff were very accommodating to me and my now fiancée when I decided to propose at this exquisite restaurant. The management team at EDWINS went over and beyond to make my proposal very memorable, they even staged the whole thing and were ready with cameras ready to catch each and every moment of my proposal. The food itself was amazing, my fiancée and I started out with oysters which had a side of onions and tomatoes in what I think was some sort of vinaigrette, which complimented the oysters very well. For our main entrees my fiancée ordered the duck breast with wild rice which was delicious with a honey glaze flavor to it. I personally ordered the beef coulette steak medium rare which had goose fried potatoes and asparagus which were out of this world. The flavors in both our entrees were very good and I was very pleased. For desert to end the magical evening we shared the chocolate pyramid which had strawberries, this treat had decadent chocolate and was very delicious. The service at EDWINS was amazing and the staff really made the evening perfect. The mission of the restaurant is truly a very beautiful thing and I look forward to coming back.
