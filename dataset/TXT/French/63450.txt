t_1myTZfYeEQ07Jr8JEF5Q Prepare yourself for a ridiculous, over the top overindulgence, followed by a food coma. There are 4 appetizer, 2 main meals and 2 dessert dishes. Luckily, they give out doggy bags so you get to take your leftovers home. The menu changes every year and it's really genius! The combination of flavours puts such a modern twist on this cabane a sucre. It's quite pricey though, so you'll leave with an empty wallet, but a very very full belly! 
Update to 2016: they make their own gin now. It's pretty darn good with some maple syrup and champagne.
