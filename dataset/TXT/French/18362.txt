A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g I have always been a fan of discovering that hole in the wall that has eclectic decor, lousy  service, poor presentation BUT the most delicious food.  I don't even need any seating if the food is that good!  Well this place had all the signs that the food was going to be beyond belief. 
    Nowhere on their sign is the name of this place and when I asked the owner. He said he didn't have time to replace the old sign       The owner/baker is not fluent in English. The inside looks disorganized and temporary as if someone just threw some tables and chairs arbitrarily into a space.  The display counters were messy and the pastries were packed in Styrofoam that you would get with cheap Chinese take-out food. 
Considering there were people in this place, by all measures, this place HAD to have great food!!!  Therein lies my disappointment.  The food was average.  The peach tart was without flavor and the raspberry white chocolate cake, which looks over the top delicious was heavy and once again lacked flavor!
Maybe their is another reason they don't put their bakery's name stickers on the takeout boxes.  I don't know...I'm just saying!
