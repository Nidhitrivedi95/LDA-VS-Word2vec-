SCklYa_jhihWAcfIn-_chg A friend recommended we check out Bonjour Brioche for some Saturday brunch, and as a lover of all things baked and bread, I can honestly say that it was great!

The place is pretty cozy, so it's fine if you're a small group, but the interior definitely doesn't fit too many people. (But that's also part of the charm!)

The wait wasn't too bad around midday, and the tasty smells coming from inside the place were enough to help us get through it until we were seated.

Service was awesome, our waitresses were all super helpful and friendly - and weren't pushy, even though we were hanging out and chatting well past finishing our food (bonus).

We ordered a chocolate croissant, and lemon-raspberry brioche to start, and both got grapefruit juice and the Croque Madame. Both the croissant and brioche were excellent - you could tell everything was fresh-baked. The Croque Madame was simple, but tasty, served with a nice light salad and little piece of baguette. We were so into it that we ended up also ordering a baguette w/jam and butter to share (which ended up finally being a bit too much food for us, but no regrets!).

All in all, loved the easy atmosphere and attentive service, and would seriously make the 35min bike trip all the way out here just to get my baguette/croissant/brioche fix. Spent a bit more than I wanted in the end, but that was pretty much an afterthought, and was worth it.

Thanks for a great East-end brunch experience, Bonjour Brioche!!
