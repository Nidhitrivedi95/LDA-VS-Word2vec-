mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q We made a reservation two weeks in advance and requested seatings at the counter. When we arrived 30 minutes early we were told the seats were overbooked and we were not allowed seating.  Management gives preference to whomever they like and wales who get priority seatings. Stay away.
