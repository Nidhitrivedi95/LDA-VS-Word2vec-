rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Poor taste. I was here with my attorney and my two salesman.  Both salesman were 21, one with ID the other without.  After waiting over an hour for our entree, we pour wine for all parties.  The manager came to our table, we thought to offer apology for the late arrival of diner, instead to take the glass away fro sale man skylit ID.  YUCK
