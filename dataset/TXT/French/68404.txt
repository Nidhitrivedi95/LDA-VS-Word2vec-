vLkKorA1gPS97Zj0_WKA0Q I was staying at the Mandarin Oriental the past weekend, so having checked the Yelp reviews of Twist, I was looking forward to dinner there with my date, but I have to say the overall experience was a letdown. 

The service was excellent, the drinks were well-made and delicious, the view was amazing, but the food was the disappointment. 

The breads were delicious, but the little pastries in the gold plate tasted peculiar. The Loup de Mar and Foie Gras dish were good, as were rabbit and lobster entrees, but for the price and the expectation I was having, I wanted something more than just good. It wouldn't be fair to talk about the dessert because by the time it came, my date and I were already full, so we couldn't fully enjoy it. The presentation was excellent, but there was just something about the taste that didn't live up to my expectation.

Honestly, I had a much more enjoyable breakfast, brunch, and dinner down at Mozen Bistro.
