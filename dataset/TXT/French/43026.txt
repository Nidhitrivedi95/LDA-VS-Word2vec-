LQ_gYNs5E10IGFE0NOyD7A What an incredible find.  The menu was unique, adventurous, varied and affordable.  There even is a happy hour from 4-6. Portions are large but still everything comes out looking aesthetically pleasing. This is a intimate hip cool neighborhood place with a nice patio in back.  Service was top-notch (and this is coming from a New Yorker and Londoner so that's saying something)! If this neighborhood restaurant was in an actual  real neighborhood in maybe San Francisco, Boston or New York you wouldn't be able to get in.  Go now before they get too well-known.
