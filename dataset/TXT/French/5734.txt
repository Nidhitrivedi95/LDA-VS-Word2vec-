3jKUbhGSjFTv5jZ0wnW0xA After a very long, circuitous walk (my own stupid fault) we finally arrived at this cute French bistro just outside the university district. We sat just inside from their outdoor patio and enjoyed a shrimp risotto and pepper steak on a beautiful summer evening. Worlds from the crowds of the old town and just the respite we needed after a long day of sightseeing. Prices are really reasonable -24$ for a perfectly cooked fillet with a decent wine list. Definitely worth seeking out - thanks fellow yelpers for the guidance.
