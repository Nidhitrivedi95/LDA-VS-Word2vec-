4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Because a friend of mine recommended this place, we thought we'd try it out. First time here with my hubby to check it out as a potential event venue. Mussels marinière and frites were quite good for starters. My husband's Cobb salad was kind of sad looking and the lardons were so hard that they were essentially indelible. My "seafood" crêpe was a crêpe filled with some green peas; this was accompanied by three shrimp and two sea scallops on the side with a cream sauce. One would expect a seafood crêpe to be filled with seafood, not just some sad little peas. Don't think Mon Ami Gabi made the cut for our event. Just meh.
