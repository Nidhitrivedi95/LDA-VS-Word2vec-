_cjPEH9wXhKS-HQe_U3M4Q Well prepared traditional French Bistro fare. Escargots, foie gras terrine, bone marrow and paté appetizers are really well done. The cocks' combs are an acquired taste, which apparently I haven't acquired as of yet. As for entrées,  the choucroute is fantastic, the beef cheeks are all right (a bit on the salty side for me) and the duck confit is proper. Always a good dining experience with good service.
