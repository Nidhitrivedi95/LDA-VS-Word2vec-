C3PVq7UpeHd6nz1_e-AtkA Ah! Cute little place. Definitely ideal for dates. 

First time I went last year, my friend and I were seated on the patio in between two ongoing blind dates and it was some good eavesdropping fun. 

Second time around we sat inside by the bar and my friends and I got the Scrolls. Very oddly named but delicious. And I don't know what they put in their salad ...probably magic because it tasted amazing!

The service was not that bad either and better still, Kalendar is the perfect distance away from Big Chill.
