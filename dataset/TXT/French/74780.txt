xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g We been to the Eiffel Tower many times. The view and the ambience is amazing. There were four of us and I had the halibut which was overcooked not very flavorful. The New York was delicious. 

We had better service and food on our previous visits. Not sure why because it was a Monday night and not that crowded.
