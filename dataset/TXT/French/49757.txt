oS96aJIHFWcFAlGHKKXjaw I stopped by to ogle the fresh pastries and purchased a cream puff that was a treat for my husband and I. I also purchased a tuna sandwich for lunch that was absolutely heavenly. I saw a couple enjoying a cappuccino and croissant and I was seriously jealous. I need to go back and try the chocolate croissant!!
