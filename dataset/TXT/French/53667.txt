They have a special tasting menu which you can try if you go there between 5-7 PM which is a great deal. We were planning on ordering from it originally but we decided to pass on it and try the famous DB burger. 

For appetizers, we had raw oysters which were great. We wanted the foie gras but they only had the cold kind on the menu (something about transitioning to lighter foods as the weather gets warmer). This was a disappointment since there are so many raves about the foie gras in the reviews from other yelpers. At the end of the night, the restaurant manager said that they can usually make it still, so in the future, just ask him and they can try to accommodate the request. 

The burger came next and it didn't disappoint at all. I thought the portion was huge for a girl, perfect for a guy. The fries were great. I loved the combination of the meats in the burger with the foie gras, though I thought the portion of foie gras should have been bigger (it's about the size of a nickel- and it should be more like the size of a quarter so you can enjoy it more). 

For dessert, we had the floating island which was light and refreshing. They also gave us some free cookies and candies since it was our anniversary. 

The service was great! Paco took care of us. He was very attentive, and even gave us a copy of the menu to take home as a souvenir of our experience. He also told us about the waterfall shows (there is the frog, flowers and balls) because we weren't sitting near the window- and he wanted us to be able to come and watch them still. If you like that sort of thing- be sure to tell them when they seat you to sit you by the waterfall. 

So overall, a huge thumbs up from us- and a big thank you to Paco for being such a great waiter!
