It's just exceptionally good!!! I did not like the chestnut jam that came with my crepe (ordered out of curiosity). It was a bit too sweet for my taste but I know what to order next time. 

I love how much whipping cream they added on the dish (a lot!). I wish they had mangoes for toppings since I'm going nut for it when it comes to crepes. Customer service was great too.

J'ADORE!
