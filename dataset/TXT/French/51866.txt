pmoIMK8zGWvKsVOPDBYfzg Such a classy place! My bf and I came here for dinner, but before our dinner reservations, he wanted to do some cognac tasting in their cigar lounge upstairs. We were led upstairs and were the only ones up there. Real intimate. We were able to take our time and relax up there and once we were done, we were led to our table in the dining area.. Beautiful ambiance. Nice comfy booths. Food was exquisite. Service was impeccable. Lovely dinner! :)
