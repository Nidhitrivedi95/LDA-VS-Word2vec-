jalA5zHW8ZfY3RSPG7oDxQ I guess I am going to be one of those that does not agree with the review...or maybe I just caught them on an off day. Either way I was underwhelmed by the experience as was my other half that used to come to cafe Du Jour all the time when he was still living in Pittsburgh. When we got there we were the only ones there, and I still think    the only ones when we left. I ordered a tomato tart of sorts, and my other half ordered the steak they have on the menu. My tart was dry, and not that exciting. Other half had the steak which was a very good portion, but had no flavor what so ever. The blue cheese they did put on it was scant. Overall it just missed the mark. On the plus side it does seem like a nice relaxing spot. Nothing pretentious about, but again nothing to exciting either.
