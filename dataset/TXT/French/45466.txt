mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q Walking through the glam and glitz of the MGM hotel and casino in Vegas to get to L'Atelier is like hiking through the world's largest Chinese brothel: wacky gold everywhere, carpets that don't seem to match the rest of the place, and NOISE! 

But I don't want to be on a total playa' hatin' review of the MGM - L'Atelier is like the proverbial oasis in the desert of MGM's glamcrapatism. Red and black interior, soothing quietness, chefs hard at work behind the sushi-style counter that envelopes the kitchen.

This place is worth a visit - but I can't say it is in the top 20 of the 'best meals of my life.' I was able to wangle a prix fixe dinner at L'Atelier Joel Robuchon along with a show (Crazy Horse - Parisian strip tease!!) for $98 through the MGM's website. I added on some dishes not on the prix fixe menu. Along with drinks, my meal was a bit over $300 (one person). 

I started off with a superb Bellini (a bit of a shock at $29). My meal included a starter of a composed 'tower' of Meditteranean vegetables (good), followed by a 'toast' of minced tomatoes and tuna (very good) and a tiny tempura of langoustine (2 bites but good). My entree was the onglet steak with leeks - very tasty in a reduction of port, I believe. The onglet was very tender. A cheese plate followed (delicious). I had a sorbet (cannot remember the flavor) as a final dish. Service was very, very good at the counter. My waiter refilled my water glass promptly and suggested a variety of wines by the glass to complement my meal. 

I'd go back. Hi Yang factor - good place to impress your Platinum card status on a 'date.' Dress up, enjoy. 5 stars.
