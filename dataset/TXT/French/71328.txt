xcmmTXhuMx2fZF2Bt69F4w I have a feeling this is going to be our new goto place in Pittsburgh.  Went here for a date night with my wife and everything was excellent.  I had the steak frites and my wife had the mussels and both were excellent.  I love Belgian beer so the beer list was to die for.  Will definitely be back!
