XcWlBj5oQgzKhR7Cxovj3w This place was awesome! I only ordered a beer and a side of french fries but it was enough to want to rate them 5 stars. 

The beer was good as it always is and the fries were delicious as well. They were crispy and had this delicious cheese crumble on top. Love it!

This is not what you think of when you think of "airport food"!
