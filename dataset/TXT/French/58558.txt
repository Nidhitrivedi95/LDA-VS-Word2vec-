RfsMUrGUJdrpfrU54rmEsQ Not as good as we hoped it would be. In fact the food was not something we would go back for. I ordered the pork tenderloin dish. The pork was a bit tough and dry but the worst part was the broken orange sauce it was covered in. Not a fan. My wife had a flank steak which we expected to be somewhat tough, it was and the sauce it was covered in was also not good. The on redeeming quality was the draft beer I had was delicious.
