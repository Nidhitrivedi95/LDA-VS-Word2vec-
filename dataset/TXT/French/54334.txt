I started with the Foie Gras Parfait. I found there to be too much ruby port gelee, which drowned out some of the delicious foie gras, but you can scrape some off and put it to the side. The Mussels Marinieres were fantastic with a generous portion of mussels and a delectable butter/vermouth/tarragon broth.
