2gUbgbdJ7IFSbicBXlSchw We asked the hotel concierge for the restaurant recommendation and the first name that came out of his mouth was L'Express. He kindly made a reservation for us even though it was for 10pm...but we were glad we had the reservation because the place was packed even at 10pm!!  Loved the ambiance, very Parisien classic bistro with cute checkerboard floor minus snobbish and arrogant Parisien attitude. Even if you don't speak le Français there's no need to feel intimidated because the waiters here are bilingual and friendly. 

The food here was pretty good! You can try various Quebecoise fromages which were high quality, highly recommended!!! The complimentary pickles in the jar were very good. Both steak tartar and hanger steak were pretty good overall, but I've had better hanger steaks in NY. The chocolate cake I had for dessert was soooo rich, I mean, it was like eating a big chunk of truffle!
