XI3iNUgChOfJk5ppjKVEQQ We had a very different experience and very disappointed. We booked a table for 8 and they didn't have a table that big so they ask us to go to next door at Bocata and they can serve foie gras for us. We did agree because the foie gras for this restaurant was rated by Montreal Blog top 16 restaurant. When we got the foie gras it was a paste. This was the only evening we had left in Montreal. I wish they specific what they are serving. Otherwise we wouldn't be there.
