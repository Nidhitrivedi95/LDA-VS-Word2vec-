WOd8tWsh2Yt_osHv-ngx_w I came here twice on my Montréal trip. The food is delicious and seasoned just right. Perhaps a tad too much salt on my home fries. 

The decor is big, bright, and happy, just what breakfast restaurants should be like! Their portions are huge. Seating is a bit squishy but totally doable. 

I got the 2 eggs, 3 bacon, 3 sausages thing which came with coffee/tea, fruits, and toast. All that for $11.95+tax! It was a sweet deal. Free refills for coffee and tea too. 

I'd definitely recommend coming here if you're in downtown Montréal. They are ridiculously busy in the morning throughout the week, but you can usually find a seat in 5 min.

1 star deduction was for in I'm personable service by our server the second time we went. I think it's because his English wasn't that great.
