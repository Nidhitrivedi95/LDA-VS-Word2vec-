SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ Some friends from Boston were in town and we decided to have a late lunch before going to an engagement at ASU.   Everything about this place was top shelf.  We chose to eat outside in a wonderful patio and the food was fabulous.  Great service.  Great everything.  I'll be going back there again and again.  So will my friends from Boston as they were very very happy with everything about the House of Tricks.
