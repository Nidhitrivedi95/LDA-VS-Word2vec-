XcWlBj5oQgzKhR7Cxovj3w been to this place twice and i'm a fan.  the first time i had the mac and cheese and wedge salad.  both were good.  i didn't care for the dressing on the wedge so when i was there the second time i asked for the "blu cheese" dressing and liked it much better.  the best restaurant in the airport.  will be back.
