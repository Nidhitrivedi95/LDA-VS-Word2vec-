FRuuIDOd21pTJHvEGIt1Gg Just happen to walk by this evening; the menu looked interesting, as did the crowd inside. A typically busy restaurant, there were no open tables, so we elected to sit at the bar. That decision made all the difference for us as bar-man Julian was the perfect host, bartender and waiter. 
Food was very good, Mixed Greens, Fresh Oysters, Vegetable Soup, were excellent starters. Strip Steak and Duck Confit were wonderful Entrees. The Butterscotch Mi-Cuit was an amazing finish,
Très bien Holder.
