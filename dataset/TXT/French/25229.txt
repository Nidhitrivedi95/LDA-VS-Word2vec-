Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA Breathtaking views and very polite service. Drinks were top notch and I loved the fact that the urinals face the south part of the strip with glass walls so you can pee while enjoying the view.  I was at a function so the bar was open, so can't comment on prices & value.  What a great time I had here!
