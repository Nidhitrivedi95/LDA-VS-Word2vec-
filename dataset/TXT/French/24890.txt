COgwFthJpS4We16W5Gf4lw Love this place.  Romantic, inexpensive, and convenient.  A great place to go before a show.  The chefs prix fixe menu is the way to go for the best deals.  They sometimes have social media deals which make it so affordable, you can't say no.

Good by the glass wine selection.  Its a touch of class that makes for an enjoyable evening.
