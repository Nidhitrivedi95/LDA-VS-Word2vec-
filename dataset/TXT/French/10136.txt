4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Heading to Vegas next week and decided to check up on their hours so I can make reservations but it came to my attention that they no longer sell the braised beef eggs benedict?! I guess normal eggs benedict with Canadian bacom will do but I really hope that I'm wrong! 

Anyway, aside from the eggs benedict, the breakfast potatoes here are goooooood. The best potatoes I've had and I love potatoes. Heck, I might just order breakfast potatoes next week (I'm kidding only.... or am I?). Steak frites are also good (that's what my boyfriend ordered). 

Definitely would recommend eating here. Mon Ami Gabi is my favorite restaurant for brunch in Sin City. Sit outside and enjoy the hot blazing Nevada sun and people watch. Although I only ate brunch here, I'm sure lunch and dinner is just as tasty; probably even better.
