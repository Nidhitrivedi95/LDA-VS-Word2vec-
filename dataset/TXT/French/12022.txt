4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Great atmosphere, excellent service, oh yeah and the food was really good too! Our dinner started with a warm baguette served in a paper bag along with a celery root confitte, compliments of the Chef. A nice touch. The roasted chestnut soup, creamed cauliflower and seared scallops were real standouts. The only suggestion I have for those who want to make their dinner a long leisurely experience, would be to tell their waiter up front. They don't at all rush you here, they just seem to know what they are doing and thus are very efficient. 

Next time in Vegas we will definitely plan to stop here for another dinner.
