hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA After all the yelp reviews that I had read about this place I couldn't wait any longer and went there today for lunch. All the reviews were correct: this place is great!!! 
Staff is super friendly and helpful. Olivier introduced himself, and helped me pick from the menu, since I was struggling because everything looked so good. Then I chatted a little bit with him about our origins (France him, Spain me). I also met Nicole, another staff member, who was equally as friendly as Olivier.
I ordered the Blue Brie, a combination of flavors and textures that was so delicious! I also had a tropical green tea, iced, which was just the perfect pairing to my baguette.
I am definitely going back to try the rest of menu items :D
