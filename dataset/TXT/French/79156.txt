ZdaZwXC0FByDY3EwNELphw What an experience! Sat at the food prep bar and conversed with the sous chef Robyn who was real nice and shared her story with us. The chef is young and talented with nouvelle cuisine. We had the prixe fix and well worth it. The duck confit was terrific. The menu changes daily and everything is organic and bought from local farmers. A must try for something different.
