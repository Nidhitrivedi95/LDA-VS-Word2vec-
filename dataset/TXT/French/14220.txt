58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw I just came back from having brunch at Le Cartet. It was, as always, delicious! 

Cartet is such a great place, it has a modern design with some small single tables and then a couple long communal tables in the back. Sitting at the long table can actually be pretty fun, since chances are you will be seated next to someone that's interesting and looks like they should be a model. (The crowd is usually filled with cool, young urban people.) 

It's pretty busy on the weekends, but the wait is never longer than 20 minutes. The servers are super friendly and very prompt. 

The menu offers a pretty wide variety of choices, my friend is a vegetarian and had plenty of options to choose from. All of the food is fresh and high quality. It's also always masterfully prepared and super tasty. Le Cartet is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Montreal, and somewhere you have to visit if you're in town.
