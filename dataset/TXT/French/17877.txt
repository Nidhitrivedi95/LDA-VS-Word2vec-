A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g French pastries?  Look no further.  Now, understandably, everyone else loves the macaroons.  Hate to be a party pooper, but they're just not my thing.  Don't get me wrong, the texture of the minis are completely awesome.  But I don't really care for candied anything, and the little bit of flavor in the middle just kinda goes bleh to me.  However, in the heart of trying it, I did try a few of their flavors and thought the pistachio was pretty great.

It could have been the day and time that I arrived, but I didn't see anything like Mille-feuille (Napoleons), even though that's one of the favorites when it comes to French delicacies.  Might have sold out at that point.

I also was amazed at the size.  The eating area stretched all the way back and was very spacious.

Definitely, next time, I need to partake in the not-so-sweet, and work on those sandwiches.  I know at some point, I'll catch one of those mille-feuille in the wild... and then... look out! nom nom nom nom nom....
