cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg Wowww, this place ROCKED my WORLD & taste buds and now I can truly say I have had Great & Authentic French food.  I was lucky that my server, Alex, pampered & SPOILED me with her expertise.  I had told her that I'm from LA where Foie Gras is unjustifiably banned because we foolishly care more about animals & pets than other poor & starving human beings and, thus, I had to have my taste buds ROCKED by foie gras and Alex succeeded with: 1) foie gras cromesquis & 2) guedille lobster sandwich with foie gras.

Thank u sooooo much Alex and Au Pied De Cochon for a memorable dinner!!!
