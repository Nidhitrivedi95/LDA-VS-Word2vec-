9ET_RUNztevq4_OLAX80Gg When you hear Daniel Boulud you expect top notch quality and this is what I received. We went to celebrate my partners birthday and knew prior to arriving what we were having - the whole rotisserie chicken with potatoes and two sides. Why? because they use the rotisol machine - google it. 

We decided for the sides to get the mushrooms and asparagus. The waiter brought out the chicken to show us how it looked before they cut it nicely and remove the bones, which had I known I would have asked that they keep the bones as I'm a fan :) 

Everything was presented beautifully - the chicken was so moist filled with flavour and the potatoes WOW- clearly they were sitting in the juices of the chickens that were roasting. The asparagus and mushrooms although it may sound plain - they were packed with flavour. 

Overall, a great experience as always and I must say for $68 you receive a lot of food for a 5 star dining experience.
