MdjIl105vqCYUGKFSUVytA Very poor service. Came here on Valentine's Day evening. We had been excited to get even a late evening seating. Waiter took our order but came back 15 minutes later to confirm our selections - he hadn't entered our choices. Dissapointing and unprofessional. 

For main courses,  The beef shortrib had good texture. I could appreciate what the plate was trying to achieve,  but it was overwhelmed by heavy-handed salt.  The same for the pasta plate.  

The highlight of the evening was the goat cheese souffle.  I would have never imagined it to taste so heavenly.  They live up to their name as a bakery.  Their dessert was also delicious! Hostess was courteous and friendly.  

In the end, neutral feelings.  Memorable for the wrong reasons.  I will return for their brunch. Maybe I will have a better impression. Will update this review then.
