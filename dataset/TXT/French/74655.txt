xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g My wife and I celebrated my birthday here and I noted in my reservations that we would like to be seated by the window to enjoy the water show from the Bellagio across the street and they accommodated us perfectly!  The view was amazing and the service was quick!  Actually too quick, lol. The food was delicious, drinks were ok and the desert was ok as well. Great romantic spot for all occasions.
