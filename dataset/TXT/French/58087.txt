rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A ckn n waffles..it was ok..bland waffles..super salty ckn...sad..

the jelly was good..the vanilla bean butter from the ckn n waffle was good..

the corn beef hash wasn't bad..egg was good..i think i ordered the wrong thing..

service was ok..and pretty much the tea was good..the whole environment is nice..classy..a bit expensive tho..
