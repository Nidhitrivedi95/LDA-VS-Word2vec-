Well, I had "onion strings" on the side anyways and the burger needed a slice of onion. I was told by the manager that the placing of the  "strings" under the bun was a corporate management decision. The "strings" were very greasy and ruined the burger. 

I decided not to ask for a carryout box for the 2/3 remains. My pet eats better.

The café could shine if the chefs were allowed to prepare food properly.
