rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw Amazing French food for a reasonable price. Highlights include:
King crab crepe - super fresh crab with a buckwheat crepe and hollandaise sauce = superb
Lobster egg Benedict - tasty lobster, very gracious with the amount of lobster, over a flaky croissant.. What's not to like?
Seafood tower - a must have if you're with a large party. Oysters are delicious, king crab legs are super meaty and the shrimp is amazing!
Quiche - probably the highlight of the meal, I don't normally like quiche but this was a very flavorful and flaky quiche that just melts in your mouth

Service was fantastic and attentive, I'd recommend going here hands down!
