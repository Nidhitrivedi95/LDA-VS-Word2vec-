ynYEgNimJOyb8dvyr9x0sA I would totally recommend this place but not on a meal-eating holiday such as mothers' day. Our reservation was for 1 p.m. and we were not seated until after 1:30. They were polite and apologetic - however, offering some sort of a complimentary snack to tide us over might have helped to take the edge off! (The rose for mom was appreciated.) 

When we were seated, we were in the bar area which featured a guitar-playing vocalist who played covers from the Eagles to the Beatles. He had a great voice! 

They have hoegaarden on tap and which we promptly ordered directly from the bartender while we waited for our server to acknowledge our arrival. 

Immediately upon being greeted we placed an order for an appetizer (roquerfort flammenkuche - more like a pizza than tart with sour cream, pears and blue cheese) and a tartin which was an open faced grilled brie and caramelized onion sandwich, to share as an appetizer. Both were good; although, I think canned pears were used on the flammenkuche. 

I would return for the tartin alone! 

So, Le Chalet is a fondue or crepe place. We went with crepe. Mine was creamed mushrooms, rosemary ham and swiss with a sunnyside up egg on it. Acceptable but not memorable. 

As if that wasn't enough food -- we are a family of eating champions -- we got chocolate fondue for dessert. The fondue was a disappointment. While the brownies were moist and cake-like and the cream puffs were a popular dipping option, the chocolate was not hot. At all. It was served in a carafe and it was melted (liquid) but it was not hot. 

While I might be convinced to give them four stars if I lived closer and was able to dine there for a non-freakishly-crowded meal, I'm gonna go with three because I would definitely go back if I was in the area but may not make the drive for cold fondue.
