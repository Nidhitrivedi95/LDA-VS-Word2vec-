0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g Picasso is truly a one of a kind establishment. It is fine dining at its best. From the decor (authentic Picassos hanging on the walls), to the beautiful view of the Bellagio fountains, not to mention the exceptionally decadent cuisine and impeccable service, I had a wonderful experience here. My then bf and I did the prix fixe menu and I started with the oysters with caviar. All I can say is that oysters are officially ruined for me. There is no way I could possibly eat them anywhere else now. Simply delicious and fresh! Then it was the lobster roll. This course was alright but still savory. Then came the swordfish, by this point I was full, actually full and my bf finished it for me. It was a hearty steak, prepared beautifully and as melt in your mouth as one can get this meaty fish to be. Finally the dessert. Oh.my.gawd. It was a farm scene, no lie, an actual farm scene, fashioned with lil, completely edible, items you'd see on a farm. A burlap bag filled with spiced apples, a ram with cookie horns, it was whimsical, delightful and it all ended up in my belly. I only wish I was obnoxious enough to take pics but I just couldn't in a Michelin rated restaurant, I just couldn't. The service was perfect and our server chuckled in a completely friendly way when he caught me playing with my dessert ram. It was refreshing to see that Picasso was upscale without being pretentious and stuffy. I'm not a wealthy person and experiences like this are ones to be immortalized forever. Thank you Picasso for delivering as perfect of a restaurant experience as one could possibly hope for AND having a sense of humor to boot!!
