I had the duck and the fat wasn't rendered properly so instead of crispy delicious skin it was white globular fat with tough connective tissues and meat. Totally inexcusable for a supposedly "French" restaurant. My friends raved about the tartare, but one had to send a cocktail back on account of it not tasting like the main alcohol featured in it. Service was lovely and informative, attentive, but the long white room was very sterile and music playing in the background added to the din which made conversation in an intimate setting difficult. Doubt I'd be back unless someone else was paying; it's too bad but honestly the mistakes were much greater than the good parts.
