4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Service was amazing. Our server was very familiar with the dining and wine menu. Very helpful in making a selection. I enjoyed the steak with the blue cheese along with the asparagus. Dinner was great. Loved the fresh bread and shredded carrots served before our dinner arrived. Great dining experience and we were a large party of about 16 and still had a great experience.
