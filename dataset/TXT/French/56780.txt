rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A The foie gras was so good I'll still be thinking about it 10 years from now. Make certain you order that if you go and you like foie gras at all. Comes on a crispy but still moist piece of bread with a plum sauce (I think it was plum). The flavors all run together into a magnificent blend. Best thing I had in Vegas 

I got a bunch of small plates and no entree. Salad was good, goat cheese with a vinaigrette.  Octopus was fantastic. Tried bone marrow for the first time, it's not for me though the preparation was excellent. Duck confit was a bit salty, but I still ate every bite.

We also tried all 6 cheeses. 3 were very good, 2 were ok and i knew I wouldn't like the sixth so avoided (my friends liked it a lot.)

Highly recommended. Great experience.
