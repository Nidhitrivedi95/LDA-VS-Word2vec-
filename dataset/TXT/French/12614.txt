4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw The place was excellent just like I expected it to be. We didn't get patio seating unfortunately, so I will use that as my excuse next time to come here again! But then, this place really needs no excuse for me to dine...

The staff here are super friendly and courteous, and very efficient. Our waitress was easy to chat with, very knowledgeable about the menu, and answered even our silly questions about the humongous wine bottles decorating the restaurant. She was very on top of everything, checking periodically to make sure everything was to our liking while my friends and I dined.

Between all 4 of us, we ordered the BLT sandwich, seafood crepe, chicken crepe, and the sandwich of the day - lamb burger stuffed with roquefort cheese. The 2 sandwiches came with waffle fries and regular fries respectively. However, their fries are very different, as they are cut super super thin, so it's like eating potato chips instead of french fries. I loved this, but my friend was not quite as fond of it. We all liked our main dish though, so that was alright =). My lamb burger was juicy and oh-so-delish. The roquefort was just such yummy goodness and a perfect complement to the lamb, which was cook to a perfect medium-rare just as I requested. I can't tell you how happy that makes me when a restaurant can fulfill such a simple request such as this. You would think the request is simple but you will be amazed how many places always get it wrong.

The ambiance is very relaxing and chic, posh without being pretentious. It was a lovely experience and I can't wait to go back again!
