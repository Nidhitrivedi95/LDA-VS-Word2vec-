4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I have been here several times over the last month. Breakfast and Dinner. I have to say this is one of my favorite spots for breakfast. You can sit on the patio and get a great view of the Boulevard and people watch. You get a gorgeous view of the Bellaigo fountains when they are running dinner time is great for that. So onto the food. The bananas foster waffle is light and delicious. I must get this everytime now. The spinach and goat cheese omlette was fluffy and cooked to perfection.  I love crepes but I really didn't like the pancakes they were nice and light just needed a little sweetness in the batter for my taste. I can see how many would like them.  The fruit bouquet is great to share and very fresh. Coffee is good and they keep it flowing. Date glazed bacon a must if you like bacon. My hubby got the corned beef hash and they use nice big pieces of freshly cooked corned beef it was very good and top quality not greasy. The muffins are great as well. I got the beef bourg for dinner it has excellent flavor. Service has been great on each visit as well. I feel they really take the extra steps to make sure you have a great experience.
