ovtlrcsVRlgZZQUlHs_ovw Came here once for a girls night happy hour.  The two stars is solely for the sangria.  It was delightful. Unfortunately it was also the only good thing about our visit.  The bartender was beyond was rude.  There was one other customer in the restaurant.  We waited 10 minutes to be acknowledged.  Even then it was a "hey, I'm backed up but I'll be right with you".  Really?? There is no one else here! He came back 10 minutes after that and said "so are you going to order something?" Like he was really annoyed.  We ordered a round of sangria. Ten minutes later he was back. He slammed our drinks on the table and said "is that it?  Food or are you just drinking your dinner?".  The drinks were good, but not good enough to put up with his attitude.  And 12 bucks a drink?  No thanks.  It's a shame, I had heard such wonderful things about this place.
