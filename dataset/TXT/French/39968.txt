I'm pretty sure it was the chef talking with the customers at the bar and he seemed super high energy! Go hungry since the portions were large and the wine list was nice. I feel like it is in an odd location, so it is easy to miss, but worth the trip. Also, the staff was great. For the weekend they were busy, and the service was on point with drinks and food.
