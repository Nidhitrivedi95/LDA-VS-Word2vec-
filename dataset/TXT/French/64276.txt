tCSlpwJQ4CZsUEMZeH2SFg I visited with a friend of mine for dinner. We had the Escargot, Risotto and Beef Short Rib Bourguignonne. The escargot were delicious, fragrant with garlic and butter. The risotto was filled with flavor. The short rib itself was a little underwhelming, It lacked seasoning, in contrast to the vegetables that accompanied it, which were sublime. 

Regardless the best part of the night was our waiter, Jay. He was radiant and always available with suggestions and wit. I would definitely recommend that you give this restaurant a try.
