ZdaZwXC0FByDY3EwNELphw Ever wondered how we can cure vegetarianism?  Well tonight I found the answer.  Find the nearest vegetarian and ask them if they squint when they yawn.  They'll pause--then imitate one.  And when they do, crush one of Union's Elk Sliders into their mouth and viola, vegetarianism cured!!!!!
