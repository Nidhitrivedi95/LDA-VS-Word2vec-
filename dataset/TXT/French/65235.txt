u-SvRRAfYgpbXZRfQgcTzA - good staff, although they work so fast that end up taking off your food from the table before you finish it. 
- place has a strong smell of food. Your clothes will get that smell.
- Good location
- very loud place
- women restroom wasn't very clean
- food is very good! I would recommend deep fried goat cheese, okonomiyaki, ebi mayo, takoyaki. 
- very pricey! 

Tip: make a reservation before arriving there.
