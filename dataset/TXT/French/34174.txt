With all the amazing reviews for Baguette Cafe I was excited to see what all the positive hype was about. Thankfully, Baguette Cafe did not disappoint! The restaurant was somewhat tricky to find located in the back of a business plaza but well worth the hunt.

The owner Oliver worked the register and asked if it was my first time at Baguette Cafe. When I said yes he excitedly went over the menu for me and explained the finer details. I ended up ordering a half and half "The Chicken Sandwich" and roasted red pepper soup. My girlfriend ordered "The Chicken Salad" and potato soup. The order arrived promptly and wonderfully presented on a small square plate and small colored cups for the soups. It looked so well made and dressed on the plate my excitement became overwhelming.

The chicken sandwich was delicious on a fresh, home made baguette, with cheddar cheese, tomato, mixed greens, bacon, superbly seasoned chicken, and a very nice tomato pesto. The ratio of meat, cheese, and bread was perfect and the sandwich oozed with flavor as it melted in my mouth. The red pepper soup was surprising. It tasted similar to a tomato basil which much more of a pepper kick. It had a light creamy taste very rich with flavor. It complimented my sandwich well. I had a bite of my girlfriend's combo and her salad, although dressed with a vinaigrette unsuitable for my tastes, had a nice flavor. Her soup was possibly the best potato soup I have ever had.

The cafe is welcoming and decorated with white walls, warm red-orange accents and yellow hanging light fixtures. It suits the establishment and their lunch driven menu well. The owner Oliver was very pleasant and assisted in the overall great vibe. The prices are very reasonable and go well with the perfectly sized portions. I had a great time at the Baguette Cafe and will surely return again.
