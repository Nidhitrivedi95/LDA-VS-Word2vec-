D7Wv_B7GBbrx-EDfgxDwRA It's not what it used to be. You're getting ripped off at Baton Rouge now. You're paying more money for less food (quality and quantity)! They try to fool you by putting less food in bigger dishes. They also go rid of the cheese bread. The ribs are smaller and have way less meat on those bones. Prices went up and i'm getting less. I don't think so....
I'm done with them.
