fyJAqmweGm8VXnpU4CWGNw Came in during dinner and had the Steak and Frites. It was one of the better restaurant steaks I have had in a while. It was little more rare than I expected, so when I go back I will order it a little more cooked than I normally get.

The frites were a mix of regular and sweet potato fries. I don't normally like sweet potato fries, but the mix of the two were really enjoyable.
