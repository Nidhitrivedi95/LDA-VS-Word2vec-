YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g Lunch here was delicious!  I definitely recommend starting with the creamy onion soup.  It was incredible!  It is definitely worth the $12.  The jalapeno soaked BLT was also delicious.  I was a little disgruntled because I asked for avocado and caramelized onions on it, which weren't put on there, and then charged for them...but the server fixed the bill and offered a free beer for the inconvenience.  Overall the place is cute, the service is good, and the food is damn tasty!
