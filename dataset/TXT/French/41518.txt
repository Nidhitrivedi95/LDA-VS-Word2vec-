The halibut was cooked and seasoned perfectly, and there was this lovely crispy onion/noodle-like feature laid overtop that complemented the texture perfectly - I highly recommend this dish. 

The bitter orange sauce on the duck, however, wasn't our favourite, but the dish overall was still delicious despite our personal dislike of that particular flavour. 

The mojito was super fun and was served in an Erlenmeyer flask and it's was good, and not too sweet. 

And the washrooms are very nice and super clean - clean washroom=clean kitchen.
