WOd8tWsh2Yt_osHv-ngx_w Wow. After nearly 300 good reviews you know you can't go wrong, and we weren't disappointed. 
We went fairly early on Grand Prix weekend Sunday, and all had a great meal at a very reasonable price. Especially given the location right downtown. 

We can happily recommend this place to anyone wanting a good, hearty breakfast/brunch that's nicely presented and prepared.
