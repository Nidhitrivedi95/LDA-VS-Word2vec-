4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I would only come back here for the French onion soup wich was a big portion and not too salty.  I love Mac n Cheese and is always a must order, but not from here it tasted like something from out of a box.  The ambiance was nice and the patio next to the outdoor seating is a nice place to have lunch.  Cant say nothing else for the food it was just eehh.
