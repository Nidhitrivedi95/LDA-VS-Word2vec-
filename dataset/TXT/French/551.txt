-u_SZ-O5C4y5aoFdDKLHLg This is a nice little resto / Bistro that is also a bring your own wine.  The menu was between fine dining wanna be and a comfort food diner, but still good.  The crowd was a mix of young trendy to older locals.  
With reasonable prices, good location and a friendly staff I'm sure I'll be making another visit in the near future.  check this place out if your in the neighborhood.
