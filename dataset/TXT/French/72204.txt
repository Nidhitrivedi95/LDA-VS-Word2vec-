XKPosZx2j4RHcZ8Ewdwj0A Went here for dinner with my husband. We arrived after 10pm so were also able to order from the late menu, which includes an appetizer, entree, and coffee or tea for $27!! I got the crab cake and mussels. Both were delicious. Huge serving of mussels with fries on the side. Hubby got the duck breast which was on the regular menu. It was cooked medium rare, though he would have preferred it medium. Still tasted great. Excellent dirty martini. Attentive and friendly staff. Would definitely go back if we visit Montreal again.
