O3OH5IEFMPtz7mPKakPZ3Q Friday night the place was empty. We were the only 4 people  in the restaurant. We made reservations last week as we were told we needed them. (LOL)
The temperature is about  90 degrees or more. We had to ask for more A/C all of the food that we ordered was just marginal at best. My salmon was burnt to a crisp. My noodle dish was overdone as well. I didn't send it back because I lost my appetite because of the heat. All of us were extremely disappointed with the food as well as temperature of the restaurant. 
Then when I was presented with the bill I was overcharged. I explained that I did not order this item to the server who did not speak English well. She called over the owner. He tells me that this is the price. I tried to explain  that the server quoted one price and now there's a $12 difference for two peoples orders. The owner  is an impossible person. He would not listen. The people in my party were uncomfortable so I just paid in full. I told him that the food/ service are terrible. He replied that other people don't think so. I said what people there's no one else in your restaurant on a Friday night that speaks volume. Sweat is dripping down my face, and the place reeks of cigarette smoke. We were thinking someone was smoking in the kitchen?
I was looking forward to eating here for a while. I  don't understand how this place has such good ratings. I have to  question their validity.
 I joined Yelp just so I could leave my review for this business.
