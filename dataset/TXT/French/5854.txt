3OCooCzHgsS2xHdN-dNVXg I'm actually pretty happy with this place. Liked the duck I got, was well cooked. My lychee martini was kind of weak but I actually don't drink that much so that's ok. The space is beautiful and the live music is great. Our waitor was very attentive and our bills were separated, no peoblem. I dont get why some reviewers are so harsh on this place.
