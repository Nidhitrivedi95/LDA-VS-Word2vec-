rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A After a bit of a strife locating the restaurant (10th floor of Venetian), we were pleasantly surprised with a zero wait when we arrived! Yahoo! 

The crackling of the fresh bread they serve is perfection! 

We ordered:

- Eggs Benedict 
- Croque Madame 
- Pastries 
- Beignets
- Oysters

All were absolutely fantastic! The eggs Benedict and oysters were my standout faves.
