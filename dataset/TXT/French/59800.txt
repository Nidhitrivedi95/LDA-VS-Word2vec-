S5gtq6g6dIfyaFvyPYyzkg We went here for a birthday dinner on January 9 and they still had their Christmas decorations up and were serving turkey. The decorations are impressive but its a bit weird nonetheless. It's a very impressive building, nicely done out... we were dining in the restaurant area at the very back...


 The staff were generally very good and attentive although there was a lull in service around dessert time - they did all troop out and sing happy birthday though - always a nice touch.


 The menu is reasonably extensive (I'd say there was something for everyone) and mains range from around £12 up £28, starters £4 upwards so its not cheap. The food was all nicely presented but fairly unremarkable in tersm of flavour. Nothing to complain about but equally so nothing to get excited about either.


 Would I go back? Yes, but there are plenty of other places I'd rather go first that offer better value for money.
