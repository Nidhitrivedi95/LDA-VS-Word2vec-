jo4KmAqlZ7vxjHIP7IIkAw I came here for a brunch date and it was a good choice.  We got a seat on the patio and ordered two dishes that were way too big for us.  Nothing really special, but good standard brunch foods.  I had the fresh grapefruit juice which tasted fine but they put ice in it...which is just wrong and forced me to drink it quickly before the ice melted.  It's a bit on the steep end of the pricing scale...over $15 per person and that's just a brunch menu item and juice each.  Not outrageous for the ambiance and location, but keep that in mind if you're planning on coming here.  And they don't accept bank cards.
