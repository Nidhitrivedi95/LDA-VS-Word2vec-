Ht-_i0UAq7YDBaqJwcQMdQ This is a really special restaurant in Montreal. I had a delicious, relaxing meal here. The staff was gracious and welcoming. And the food was wonderful. The restaurant's atmosphere is cozy and elegant, and it's off a little side street in Old Montreal. A bit more expensive than some options, though I really enjoyed it.
