D7CnTsm8SCmbQghz1ioPdw First time here, and would drive the couple hours to do it again! My husband had mustard braised rabbit with carrots and gnocchi, and I had an amazing wild mushroom fettuccini bolognese. Desserts were also tasty: Nutella s'mores and peach/blueberry bread pudding with homemade ice cream. All was very fresh and cooked to perfection. The only thing that was a tad disappointing was his old fashioned, which was just a splash of watered down flavored whiskey over ice cubes. My cocktail was tasty but awfully small! But the service was terrific and everyone on staff was friendly and accommodating! Would definitely eat there again.
