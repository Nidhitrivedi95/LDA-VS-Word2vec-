While I was only able to try their excellent chocolate soufflé, the chocolate ball looked intense too. For the meal I started with the escargot and went with the butter poached lobster for my main. Both were solid four star dishes, but neither pushed my tastebuds to new heights. Overall a nice meal and a great "before the show" restaurant option, it's extremely close to the entrance to O -  Cirque du Soleil.
