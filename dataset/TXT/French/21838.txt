Bh8qt5P8MmhEEu_qRLz7EQ Family and I passed by here after dinner for some more drinks. We had a couple youngins with us so we couldn't exactly go to a bar. Decided to try Café Du Nouveau Monde and it was pretty great. Lots of drinks on the menu and plenty of beers on tap. I was also able to steal some bites of the crème brûlée which was amazing.
