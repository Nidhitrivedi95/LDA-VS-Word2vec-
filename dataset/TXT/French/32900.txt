H464UiJ5c7q5dAJ14h731A Really enjoyed my experience at Gus.

The restaurant is small so an intimate setting which is great, we sat at the bar, and we had a blast with the chef and waiter, very nice people and great conversation.

As for the food, we shared the octopus as an entrée, it was perfectly cooked and tender, worthy of any spanish restaurant.  As a main I had the tartare which was very well seasoned, and the home fries divine.  Portions are generous so we were to full for desert.

I will definitely go back
