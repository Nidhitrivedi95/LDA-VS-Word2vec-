4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Mon ami Gabi was really pretty good and didn't break the bank. We wanted to grab a quick bite late afternoon so a colleague suggested to stop by here. Fantastic view if the Bellagio fountains from the patio and outside.

The ham and cheese crepe was light and perfectly prepared. The hollandaise was great and served to the side of the crepe so as to not smother it. Service was also great but the hostess was a bit snooty.

While waiting for a friend I ordered a croissant and cup of coffee. I will say that it was one of the best croissants I have ever had. Crispy, buttery, soft inside and was a perfect match for the French roast.
