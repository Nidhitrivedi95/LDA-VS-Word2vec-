Ht-_i0UAq7YDBaqJwcQMdQ Very hip restaurant in the basement of an old city building. The food clearly lives up to its reputation. Fantastic romantic atmosphere as well dark setting very intimate small dining room and incredibly attentive service. Very low background music with eclectic beats helps drown out other tables conversations

Their house specialty Rizzo to appetizer was out of this world and better den all risottos I've had in New York City. Specifically the use of ultra sharp aged cheddar along with frozen fois gras and al dente grains made a fantastic combination.  The other appetizer that we had was their grilled octopus season with Mediterranean and middle eastern spices cooked to perfection. 

The main courses were also delicious. The duck was as good as any that I've had however the hell with that had a beautiful crust but was slightly dehydrated tutu to focus on creating this beautiful golden crust. 

The wine selection on the bottle side was absolutely fantastic however somewhat wanting on wine by the glass side.
