uRSPHDMBtYedbBbbHd3gOA My partner and I came for the vegetarian tasting menu on New Year's Eve. It was delicious, particularly the butternut squash soup with smoked sour cream and the pan-seared potato gnocchi. My partner really enjoyed her gluten-free option (polenta and red cabbage), but didn't love the lentil dish that followed.

The ambience was nice for a date, and the service was attentive and friendly. We would go again!
