yAkT-tNGut0rbWlA7kjrdg Oh my, I spent a real long time ogling this place before I dared to go in. The display in the front window has the most minimalist display of pastries I've ever seen. But the pastries looked so good. And not only did they look good, they were also delicious. 

The chef, who is French, and his wife, who works at the cafe, opened this patisserie and espresso bar only a few months ago (3, I think) against all odds, during the recession. The woman claimed that during the recession she figured people would still want good quality food. And they provide. They even have regulars now. The chef learned how to make pastries and macaroons from a Pierre Herme course in Paris (I'm told Pierre Herme is a master macaroon maker). 

I tried two things when I went there: a vanilla macaroon at the woman's recommendation, and a raspberry and vanilla tart. They were both delicious. When the woman was recommending the vanilla macaroon, she said she'd never really been all that enthusiastic about vanilla (and neither have I), but that the vanilla macaroons were surprisingly amazing. And they were. 

If you're in the area and want to taste some pricey, yet delicious, tarts and macaroons, this is the only place to go.
