YUFxSG6idHePsxOmnSHtpQ I placed an order online for Thanksgiving dinner several weeks in advance, as I would not be preparing dinner this year due to getting knee surgery the day before Thanksgiving. I received no confirmation, which seemed odd and made me somewhat nervous and nothing was charged ahead of time. I picked up my order Thanksgiving Day at 1 p.m. The service was fairly quick and the cashier was very nice. We warmed up the meal according to the directions. However, there was some sort of foreign object in the mashed potatoes so I didn't eat those. And the sweet potatoes tasted burned. The rest of the meal was very good and my family enjoyed it for the most part.
