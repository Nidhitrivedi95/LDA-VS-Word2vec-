uP3H5bcsiTXM0k0xQhRndg Thanks to Yelp we found this place. Starters was awesome. Goat cheese tomato tartelette, Beet salad and Foie Gras Mi-Crit. The Buckthorn berry jam, was incredible and made me miss DK, never had this outside Denmark. The White wine we had with it was perfect. Starters alone was 5 stars. Had the recommended Mac&Cheese and The Ultimate Experience. Both was good but too sweet in the taste for us, some green beans with the pork would have been good. The local IPA was great to this food.
