rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I enjoyed dinner here with my girlfriends as the capstone to our weekend in Vegas.  I was delighted with the entire experience.  Our server was clearly attached but was receptive to flirting and joking.  He was also a fantastic salesman...sous vide short ribs?  yes, please!  (Holy cow, btw, it was SO GOOD with fresh baby corn and shiitake mushrooms and a sauce that I could barely restrain myself from licking the plate...) The look and feel is authentic bistro, yet just having come back from Paris, this place could stand up among the best there easily.  

Dessert was probably the best part.  We shared a sourdough waffle that was accompanied by cherry compote, hazelnut ice cream, Nutella (or a reasonable facsimile thereof), and vanilla bean whipped cream.  Apparently said waffle is a regular breakfast item.  I wanted to come back the next morning. The second choice (because four people CLEARLY demands two desserts, no?) was chocolate bouchons (really, a perfectly fudgy brownie thing) with vanilla ice cream.  Freaking amazing.  

I was honestly a tad wary of trying to eat at any celeb chef joint in Vegas, but because Thomas Keller won't put his name on just any business proposition that comes along, I figured Bouchon was a good bet.  And, oh my, it was.  It's pricey, but still in line with practically every other nice place on the Strip. I wanna go back!!
