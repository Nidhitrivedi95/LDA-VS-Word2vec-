You basically tell the hostess what you want to eat as soon as you walk in, wait for it to be entered into a tablet, and then walk down a cafeteria line where you pay at the end of the line.  You pay for baked goods at a separate register, even if you want it with your meal.  The staff was very nice, but need more training.
