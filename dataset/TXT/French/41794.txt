KNBHGY4rQVuoHxZf_6ANuw This is probably a great business hotel.  It's not great for tourists.  The room was very nice, but the atmosphere of the place was cold and sterile.  When we arrived around 8 p.m., there was no one at the bell hop station.  You had to go up the escalator to get to the front desk.

There were no brochures or suggestions of what to do in Montreal in the lobby or on offer at the front desk.  We told the receptionist we had never been to the city before and we still got few suggestions, even though the concierage was standing right next to her.  Not very welcoming.  Also, we didn't find any breakfast anywhere!  Couldn't even get more than one cup of coffee in our room!
