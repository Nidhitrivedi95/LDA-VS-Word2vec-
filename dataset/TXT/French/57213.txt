rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A My first Thomas Keller experience and certainly not my last. The three days I stayed here in Vegas, I ate at Bouchon every morning. All three different meals, and all excellent. My favorite would have to be the jardiniere breakfast which includes a fruit salad, a pastry (i had the pecan sticky bun...mmmmmm) a tomato and leek gratin, eggs, toasted brioche and country potatoes. sounds like alot, but the portions were perfect so i didn't feel like a total glutton. of course a nice bellini goes very well with it too! also, if you happen to want meat, i'd definitely recommend the bacon. sooooooo good.
