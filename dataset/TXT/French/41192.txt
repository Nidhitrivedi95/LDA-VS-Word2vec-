kGOr_D-LNpgZ2M9N8TT4QQ Visited La Societe last week for an event.  The restaurant itself is quite beautiful and ornate.  Reminds me of actually being in France.  The bar service was ok, if a bit slow given it wasn't too busy when we arrived.  It got really busy later in the night and the server neglected to bring water to the table despite being asked several times.  The house red and white wines tasted good and were on special which made the price reasonable at $7 per glass.  The fries with garlic aioli weren't a very generous portion and overall the menu seemed very overpriced.  The music was way too loud to have a comfortable conversation and the large number of people also contributed to the high noise levels.  I hear the patio is lovely in summer so might visit again, but just for drinks.
