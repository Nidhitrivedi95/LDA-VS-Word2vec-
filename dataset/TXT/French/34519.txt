HojKatUfX4UHWaPqtl63NQ The walk to Rivea from Mandalay Bay is nice, as you get a view of the Delano lobby. I went to Rivea with a large group of 15 people and was able to get a table at 8pm, which is great for Las Vegas. Our server was attentive and seemed knowledgeable of the food. I will say that our server and his manager knew relatively nothing about the wine list so it was difficult to determine what bottles we wanted to order. The small plates are fantastic. We had an argula and cured ham pizza and chickpea fries that were to die for. The bread basket is also pretty impressive.

We all ordered different dishes for our main course. I had two more small plates for dinner, including the mozzarella di bufala and tomato and the sage/parmesan cheese potato gnocchi. 
Both were fresh and cleanly executed. While the table was generally satisfied with their meals, I will say that our server's apparent knowledge of the menu was contradicted by what we actually received, in that many of the dishes were not what he described. 

The best part of Rivea, however, is the outdoor patio areas: one smoking and one non-smoking. The view of the strip is insane from Rivea's 64th floor vantage point. I'd be interested in going back with a smaller group and eating outside. Overall, I felt the bill was rather pricey for the overall experience but the view was an added bonus.
