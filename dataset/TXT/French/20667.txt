AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw Wonderful food.  Excellent, melt in your mouth, delicious kind of food.  The type of restaurant that makes you feel like you are dining in Paris or Rome.  The decor is cute yet fancy.  A fancy tea party with yellow napkins and pin striped tablecloths.  You even have your own mini butter tray.  Just the cutest place.

Our server was interesting.  The man had wonderful intentions but mad for a confusing and awkward experience at times.  After we viewed the menu for 10 minutes and were sure of what we wanted he came over to take our order and also tell us the specials.  He then went on to talk about how wonderful the specials were and how we would be a fool not to order them.  Well thanks, Guy.  There were other awkward moments throughout our time there, but the food was great.  And... who doesn't get a kick out of an awkward server every now and then.

There is a separate store front to this place that you can go up to the counter and buy pastries, dessert, coffee ect.  A place worth checking out while your in town.
