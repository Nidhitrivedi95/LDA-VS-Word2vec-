xaqW4NkmUCGRRjmLxiFJ6Q I found this hidden gem on Yelp and finally got to try it! Best quality time with siblings over a great brunch! The location itself is quite hidden inside a small condo plaza however totally worth it! Seating wise, there aren't much space but staff and service was beyond my expectations! I believe the owner himself makes the crepes fresh right in front of you. There is a wide selection of savoury and sweet crepes and you can also make your own (kind of like subway but even better because it is stuffed in a fresh crepe). If you are hungry and can eat a lot, this location can definitely fill you up! The price is reasonable with a calming and clean atmosphere. 

I definitely recommend to try their fresh sugarcane drinks! I mixed mine with fresh fruits and it became one of the greatest smoothie I've ever tried! I will definitely bring more people here for breakfast, lunch or brunch! :)
