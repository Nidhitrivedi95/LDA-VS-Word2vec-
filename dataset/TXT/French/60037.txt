sARavfidmIS878q5BtlyVQ When we came here the first time in 2011, we were certainly very impressed even comparing to jose's other restaurant Bazaar. Therefore, when we came here the second time, we kept our expectation low feeling like they would not be able to do any better than the first time. Somehow, they were able to wow us again with almost a different menu! Some of the dishes from 2011 were just creative not tasty for us. In the 2012 version, we had absolutely no complaints on every single dish. I usually don't write reviews unless the dining experience is really good or really bad. E is for sure a winner and we re looking forward to go there again once they change heir menu again. Bring your date there to impress. It will be a life time experience. =]
