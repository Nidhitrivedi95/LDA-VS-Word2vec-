Vkl5QgIfpi6fS-Xox1EOug This is one of the few quality restaurants on Nun's Island. I like the location, the ample parking and the atmosphere of the restaurant. I have gone on several occasions, and while the first months were rocky terms of service and food quality, it seems to have improved. 

I don't find it particularly child friendly, though they do have high chairs there, it's more of the +18 crowd. 

The food is better at the Bernard location, but I hope it will get better as they settle in.
