4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Ah, Mon Ami Gabi. What can I say?  Well let's see..................

Mon Ami Gabi is our go to restaurant whenever any friends or family from out of town show up on our doorstep.  The food is always excellent, the service for the most part is always top rate and mostly it is the French Vibe the place gives off. If however, French Vibes are not your thing, go for the food anyway. 

The restaurant consists of basically 3 rooms. The back room is a bit on the dark side where you can imagine Victor Hugo sitting and enjoying a glass of Absinthe (sorry, not available here) and writing his next great masterpiece. The front room is very light and airy where you can imagine Truffault and Deneauve discussing their next cinematic project  over an amusing Beaujolais. The best of the three is the outdoor patio, which has to be the best patio dining in Las Vegas. Pure Paris.....Fresh air, the fountains of Bellagio with music across the street and a constant stream of people to observe and try and figure out.  Be warned that no reservations are accepted for the patio, so a brief wait may be in store, but if time is important you can reserve a table indoors.

Food, Oh yes.............They do serve it. 

You can not go wrong with any of the 3 Steak Frites versions. The French onion soup is to die for as are the Scallops.  Salads and Quiches are also excellent , and any of the desserts will please. They have quite an extensive Wine List, but if You ask for the House Wine which is kind of hidden on the list You will get a Bottle from Louis Latour or George Duboeuf depending on your preference.

We were there on opening day and I can't even count how many times since. By Las Vegas prices, it is a place you can bring company to and still have a couple of bucks left to try your luck in the casino. Bon Appetite.
