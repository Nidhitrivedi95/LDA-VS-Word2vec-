4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw One of my favorites!  Great view, great food, great friendly service and the price is great!

Great View - Right across the street from the Bellagio water show.  Just ask to be seated outside.  There are also a lot of overweight birds asking for food.  They will eat out of your hand

Great Food - Can't complain.  I love their burgers.  They are literally like 5lbs and the fries are unique.  Very flat and very good.

Great Service - Very friendly and professional.  A Class.

Great Price - To top it all off, the price is not bad.  It's like $10 for a burger, but definitely feels like we got our moneys worth.

Note : They don't allow sleeveless shirts or swim suits apparently.  I don't mind girls in swim suits but seriously who walks into a restaurant in the middle of the strip in a swim suit.
