rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Great atmosphere and the long hallway to the restaurant is absolutely beautiful.  The food was just so-so. The lamb shank was soft and off the bone, but the flavor was slightly gamey. The sauce; average at best. We also had the steam mussels which was ok and nothing spectacular.

They do however serve the best butter I've ever had in my life. It was as if the butter was churned that morning. Very smooth & creamy. 

Overall a very average meal, I would give it 3 1/2 stars if possible bc of the 
butter but definitely not a 4.
