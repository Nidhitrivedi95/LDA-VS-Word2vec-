qnFdBp12seAxwe2_iHM2bA Sometimes it is fun to treat yourself and try out an expensive restaurant for a night of haute cuisine.  On a recent Friday night a friend and I came to Laloux, a classic French restaurant, for this kind of splurge.  The space is classic, simple yet elegant with its white tablecloths and cloth napkins.  It also has large windows which allows for plenty of natural light.

The food here is absolutely delicious and I enjoyed every bite of my meal.  My appetizer was a grilled asparagus served with an apple puree and roasted apple.  It was amazing.  The apples added a hint of sweetness to the dish.  That was followed by a Gaspor piglet which was succulent and served alongside a polenta which had been cooked so that it was crispy on the outside yet soft and chewy on the inside.

For the grand finale I ordered a lemon tart which was divine.  The filling was well-balanced and the pastry crust was incredibly buttery and tender.  It was topped with a white chocolate ice cream that was excellent.  I should also add that in all cases the plating was beautiful.  

Of course delicious food requires fine wine to accompany it.  Fortunately they have an extensive wine list to meet this requirement.  You are sure to find something to your liking here.  If you are in the mood for a digestif they also have a good selection of those for after the meal.  

When it comes to service it was very attentive.  Our waitress checked in on us often and was very knowledgeable about the menu.  I felt like we were well taken care of during our meal.

While some may balk at the price tag it is definitely worth it.  Sure I could never come here week in and week out because it would get too expensive.  However, it is definitely worthwhile coming here when you are in the mood for a treat or to celebrate a special occasion.
