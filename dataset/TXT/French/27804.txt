dU7SLTS6_HWo1YPHZ4DmOw Four of us went to this restaurant for mother's day. We had a reservation and were seated immediately. The service was quick at the beginning but slowed down considerably by the time we ordered coffee and dessert, maybe because the place had filled up. We had to ask for pepper, they also forgot to bring spoons with the coffees. One of the servers was happy to take a group photo for us and all of the people who came to wait on our table were very friendly.
The ricotta gnocchi was pretty good. The bone marrow appetizer was good, the Seafood Stew "Zarzuela" was good, as was the Beef Bourguignon. I felt that the quality was good for the price. The place is small and a little bit tight, but nicely decorated and inviting. They have a small patio, too. My main complaint was that my table had one round centre leg and it was very uncomfortable; I am not a large person and I had nowhere to put my feet, so I would recomment asking for a table that has 4 legs.
