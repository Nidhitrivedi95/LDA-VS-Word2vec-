SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ This is absolutely one of my favorite restaurants! The food is amazing and the service is always top notch! Naomi was such a pleasure! We couldn't of asked for a better evening. Also an added plus are the wonderful well behaved cats! I will admit it's a crazy cat lady's dream, good food, great service and cute cats . But seriously If you are looking for a wonderful romantic night to take a significant other look no further, this is your place.
