JezHN-9KKLTMbojq00VP0g Absolutely love the feel and food of this quiet, local spot. The staff is friendly and prompt. The food is French and just lovely. Perfect for a romantic date, day or evening. Close your eyes and you're in Paris

Absolutely get the chocolate croissant (it comes warmed out of the oven) and the white bordeaux!
