From an eclectic menu, I opted first for Escargot with Garlic Butter & Crostini, which was an unusual-looking, yet very tasty indented tray of cooked snails with tomatoes, mushrooms, and Garlic Wine Sauce, along with excellent Garlic Bread.  Calamari Fritti was tasty, as well.  And, complimentary doughy bread was very well received.

Next up was an excellent cheesy crock of French Onion Soup, followed by a very good large Caesar Salad with creamy Italian Dressing, Romaine Lettuce leaves, cheese, and hard croutons.  Pan Roasted White Fish was moist, delicate, and delicious, served with a small amount of warm Arugula Salad and very tasty Italian Roasted Potatoes.  So were the Fried Potatoes that served as Chips for the Battered Fish & Chips that I also got to sample.

Service was quite accommodating and helpful.  Our waiter even offered to make Decaf Iced Tea from scratch for me, and did so.  Live music could be heard from the next room, and booth seating was quite comfortable.  The only discordant note was a real slow kitchen.  A huge break between starters and delivery of entrees almost caused my party of four to miss the start of the movie we came to see at Regal Aliante Stadium 16 located in the same building.

A solid 4 stars overall!
