FJMMPL3pxAPYGEPB0Hwlhw Toca Toca Toca!!!!! Before I begin to hype this place up, be assured that this is an honest and private review. So here we go...This is going to be a long one.  Third time celebrating a birthday and nothing but exceptional service, high quality products, modern and spacious layout with a selection that no Toronto restaurant buffet can come close to. If you are a seafood lover, sushi, lobsters, oysters and shrimp are offered. For the carnivores; beef wellington made to perfection, Cornish hen, two types of fish (not a fish eater, so can not tell you what type of fish were offered) and assortment of soppressata. Vegetarians are not forgotten: kish, couscous and variety of fresh salads. Then goes the standard: egg Benedict,  waffles, pizza etc.. If you have a sweet tooth, holly sh#t. There is a dedicated area just for the sweets. With no exaggeration there must have been 12 different options, from vanilla tarts to macaroons to puff pastry and we were told they bake everything in house. If you are not impressed yet... here comes the icing, unlimited bilini's and mimosas. After rereading the above, the 3 hour seating period might not be enough for the next time:) For those that are still READING - THANK YOU! Just a bit more. The little negatives that can be improved. A) The quality of oysters must be better considering the price point. B) As great as the dessert options are, they were better the first time that my husband and I visited. C) sushi can be more creative and have less rice. That is it for now. Until the next review.
