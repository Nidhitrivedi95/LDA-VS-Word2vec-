SCklYa_jhihWAcfIn-_chg *3.5 stars

Today was my first day having brunch here.  We decided to go with the daily special, poached egg, with smoked salmon or peameal bacon and hollandaise sauce.  (that's right eggs benny, without being called eggs benny).  I had the smoked salmon, and my bf ordered the peameal bacon.  It was delish - there were lots of different flavours so its was hard to tell what was going one.

Pros:  the eggs benny came on a fresh butter croisant, and not an english muffin.  Also came with some pickled celery and caramelized onions, which sweetened the dish.  The salad with their house dressing was amazing.  

Cons:  The hollandaise sauce was thinner than most places and a little bit more lemony, the side of baguette with butter (a super huge pat of butter) was a bit of overkill.

I couldn't help myslef and ordered their savoury tart du jour (fig caramelized onion, and blue cheese).  It tasted like a small quiche.  It was ok, I would try a different flavour maybe next time, or maybe I was just full.

I ordered the pecan tart to go.  This had a nice consistency, not to runny, and caramelized butter tart filling, yum.

Overall 3.5 stars b/c they did some things really well, and other things not so much.

BTW we got a seat inside and it was boiling like a sauna, and it was so loud it was hard to have decent conversation.  It was also pricey, with tax and tip it came to over $50.
