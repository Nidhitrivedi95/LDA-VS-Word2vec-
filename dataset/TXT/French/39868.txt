K64Uw3a2Enh2MznpwRHWKQ This was by far one of the best restaurants I have been to. The service was phenomenal. From the moment we had walked in we were greeted with smiles. We felt very welcomed. Our water cups were constantly filled and we were checked on numerous times.  The waitress did a wonderful job explaining the dishes and even recommended the duck. The chef makes his dishes from scratch and the food was very fresh. I haven't had a salmon as good as the one I had here. The decorations were beautiful and the seating was very comfortable. I highly recommend this and am coming back for sure.
