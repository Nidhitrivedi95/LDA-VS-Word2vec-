bzbNGyrTwWHAgg1CqkSgeg Thought it was pretty good.  First time going here after I had heard a lot of great things so I suppose my expectations were pretty high.  That being said I wasn't compelled to come back here with haste.  I had the Chicken and waffles which I found to be just okay.  I did enjoy the mocha though and the also thought the biscuits were above average.  Also kind of expensive for breakfast food, but I'd be happy to pay if it was worth it.  Probably won't be back soon.
