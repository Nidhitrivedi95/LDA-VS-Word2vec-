fNCyfJOfd2R42hkhz2tALQ Food was great, atmosphere was great and the bring your own beer and wine was awesome. The only problem was that when we took money out to pay the waitress said that in "Montreal" you should tip 15%! Mind you we would have tipped 20% but when she said that we stuck to the 15% because she was very unprofessional.
