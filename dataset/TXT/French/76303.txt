         I was here for CES (Consumer Electronics Show), a whole week in Las Vegas is a long, long, long time :-) Stayed at Bellagio and Wynn, on expense account, I'm not complaining. So Tableau was evidently going to be on my brunch list. 

        I stumbled upon it by accident, because RED 8 wasn't open yet, then we just sorted of came here. Otherwise, I would NOT even find this place.  The place was full of sunshine which I love, gorgeous decor, spacious, just a perfect spot for brunch.

- Orange Zest, orange, carrot, ginger, asian pear, nectar - so good

- Red Deliciousness, fuji apple, bell pepper, pomegranate, beet, lime - got to cleansing my system after being in Vegas for so long. 

- Chicken Noodle Soup, Mary's Free Range Chicken dumpling, orecchiette - beautifully presented, the soup pour on table side, love it. 

-  Duck Hash & Eggs, duck confit, fingerling potatoes, scrambled eggs, 23 roasted tomato hollandaise - it was delicious.

- Egg to order - mushroom, spinach, tomato, onion rolled up nicely, just perfect.

         The service was good and I will definitely come back soon.
