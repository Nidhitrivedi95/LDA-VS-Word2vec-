SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ What an awesome find! I finally got to try this place after hearing so many great things about it from other friends. The staff definitely did wonders here trying to fuel or pre-bachelorette party night fun last Saturday. 

The restaurant appears to be an old historic house - possibly even two houses connected together by a long welcoming stretch of a patio. It had been a rainy evening and cold one at that, so it was nice to get into the dining area where the ambiance had cozy and refined wrapped up in a bundle!

I think our server was the resaturant manager. He did everything in his power to make our experience wonderful for our group of 10 girls. 

Memorable items of the night:
Old fashioned drink - very well done and potent here. My first glass was Makers Mark infused with Vanilla and I think maple as well. They ran out of it for the second round, so my second glass was with Woodford Reserve as requested. 

Rack of Lamb - the special of the night. Cooked to perfection. Tender, not gamey at all!

Scallop appetizer - Appetizes only two people since there were only two scallops on the plate, but it was served with a quaint arrangement of small thin but very flavorful well seasoned vegetables. This is big coming from me, because as an outspoken meatatarian, it is usually difficult to get me to eat vegetables, yet I loved these ones.

The homemade butter was spiced and delicious in its own right when served before out appetizers with sliced baguettes. 

Overall cozy, warm, inviting restaurant. I'd say it's Tempe's own hidden gem.
