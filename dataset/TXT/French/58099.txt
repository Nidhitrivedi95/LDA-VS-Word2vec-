rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Seriously, Its not that impressive.  Up to a point that I don't even remember what the taste was right after when I walked out the restaurant.

The food is mediocre at best.  Nothing to be wowed about.  Service was average at best.

I don't know what the hype was about, but everyone in my party believed that it is just an OK place.  There are many more dining options in Vegas, try somewhere else.
