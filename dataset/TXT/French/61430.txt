SJo_IjvzdRtCvZVN0cbrRQ Absolutely delicious.  But if you are trying to eat healthy, you might want to skip this place.  No healthy options - so go and splurge.

After my post I received a message from The Blue Door. I was advised there are actually quite a few healthy choices on the menu - not to mention that all ingredients are organic, if not local.  Don't skip this place - it really is DELICIOUS.
