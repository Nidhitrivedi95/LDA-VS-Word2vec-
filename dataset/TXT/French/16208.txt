7l9Tw1GYrVR9-aJOOh9q7Q An ok place to watch Habs games.  Nice high-def projection screen, and plenty of plasmas.  It'll be broadcast in French, but because they blast house music during the commercials that gets everybody yelling, you can't hear the game anyways.  Any deals on beer disappear during the game, and they don't do a cheese plate anymore, but the nachos look not awful.  Each table gets a player's number; when your player scores, the table gets a round of cheap whiskey on the house.  

It's all a bit much for me.  Big party atmosphere.  If you're just looking for a good place in the Plateau to watch the game, and you actually want to hear it, try Inspecteur Épingle (French broadcast) or Verres Stérilisés (English).  Both are charming dives.
