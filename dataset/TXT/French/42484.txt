LdD0yYLcHuamULrvZYY3Jg One of my favorite "bring your own wine" restaurants in Montreal. It's a pretty old restaurant but has consistently served good food every time I've been there.

It can be hard to find parking here, as it's in an old house that's been converted to a restaurant in the middle of a neighborhood. I'd recommend parking on Mont Royal street and then walking to get there. It's easier than finding parking close by, and only five minutes walk.

The place makes you feel like you're home. There's a good ambiance and the staff is really friendly. They have just 2 options on their menu. The first is the table d'hôte, which includes a soup or salad, a main course of your choice, and a regular coffee or tea for a price between 27$-35$. For the bigger eater, there's the gourmet menu, which includes the same things as the table d'hôte, but adds an entrée and a dessert for 39$-47$.

Last time we were here, I had the fish of the day which was a cod with a spiced crust. The others I was with had the rack of lamb, stanstead rabbit, and guinea fowl stuffed with foie gras. I tried all of it, and everything was delicious, perfectly cooked and seasoned. Everyone was happy about their choice and since you can bring your own wine, it's even better.
