Apart from that, it's pretty on par or even below. Decor is quite pathetic for what they strive to be, unless you have infra-red glasses, it's simply too dark and the DJ absolutely sucked ass.

The crowd is what you'd expect: desperate wannabees with nothing to say for themselves and only interested in posing. Everybody who works there thinks they are the bee's knee,  but service is at least professional and quick, and the drinks were quite good.

So for an extra dirty Grey Goose martini, a vertigo-inducing pee and gazing at the lights, I'd definitely recommend the place. Just don't waste your money if it's a night with a cover.
