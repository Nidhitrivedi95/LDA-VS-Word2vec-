bVuPp6xuI4UPXlAEkEd2bA Went last week during the Happening Gourmand.  

From the fixed menu I chose the Garlic Escargot, Angus beef bavette, and Crème brûlée.  

Given Narcisse was the least expensive of the Happening Gourmand restaurants I was pleasantly satisfied with the meal.   

In fact out of the 3 HG restaurants we tried Narcisse was my favorite.  

The standouts for me were -

The escargots  - nice twist on traditional escargots with cheese melted.
The beef bavette - inexpensive but well prepared piece of meat.
The french fries - savory and lots of them.

The service was a tad on the slow side but i think it was more to do with our waitress than systemic of the restaurant.
