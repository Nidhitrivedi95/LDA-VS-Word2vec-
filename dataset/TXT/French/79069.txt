ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug I've come here a bunch of times over my many visits to Vegas and it's usually a good place to go when you got no place else to go. 

I used to come here craving the buffalo chicken wings, but they revamped their menu and no longer serve them. Big bummer! It was awesome hangover food. 

Now, it's a little bit more pricey for the food but its not bad food. This time I had the french dip which was tasty and delicious and their spinach salad which was fresh and good too. 

I didn't care for their french onion soup last time, but maybe it was since I wasn't a fan. 

HIt or miss with the service here. Sometimes you get a good server... and sometimes you don't. It's Vegas. Take a gamble!
