Yp9w4nhUowBU_IS_StFXbQ I stayed at the Wynn for four days and ate at Tableau 3 of the four days. We loved it! They make fresh juice that is fantastic. The food seems to be made to order and doesn't taste microwaved. They have so many fantastic choices that we would rather have a late big breakfast and skip lunch. The service is friendly and prompt. If you are not into Vegas buffet, this is the best place for breakfast hands down.
