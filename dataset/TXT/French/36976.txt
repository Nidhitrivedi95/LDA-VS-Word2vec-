in3zjiaLpNzr9G3K35gAJQ I've been coming to Vincent Market Bistro for the past 5 years and they were one of my favorite restaurants then and they are still one of my favorite restaurants now. I normally eat here for brunch or lunch, but was told that they extended their hours and offer dinner. 

I've always hated their service here because it was always slow and pitiful, but this morning was an exception. Maybe it's because we were the only customers here at 8 in the morning, but our server was really attentive and friendly. Their menu hasn't changed very much and I ordered the crab quiche and hubby ordered the French toast. They always offer complimentary croissants which is always awesome and buttery and delicious! I decided to not even share my entree with my hubby and I ate my crab quiche - all of it all by myself! 

When we were done, like I remember, they offer complimentary dessert which was a fruit tart with ice cream on top. Prices are extremely inexpensive too! For two entrees, complimentary croissants and complimentary desserts, we spent around $25. What great value!!! 

I love it here and if you like French cuisine, I'm sure you will love it here too! I will definitely come back to dine for dinner.
