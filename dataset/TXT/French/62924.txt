SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA Another great experience - revisited my favorite soup, the potage. The portion was a little smaller than I remember, but it tasted just as creamy as I remembered.  I had the veggie pizza and it was loaded with fresh roasted mushrooms, peppers, etc. and topped with my goat cheese, my favorite.  Kudos to the staff who did not seem annoyed that my toddler was with us (it was mother's day after all!).  And if you haven't tried the mustard on the table, it's AMAZING!
