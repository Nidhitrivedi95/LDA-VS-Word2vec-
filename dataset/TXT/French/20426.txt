AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw I spent 8 days at Caesars and discovered this great place for breakfast very quickly during my visit. I loved the quietness and solitude of the restaurant. Payard is an oasis in the "hustle and bustle" of Caesars Palace.

I am a huge Eggs Benedict fan and I had read that Payard's Eggs Benedict were wonderful. My server also touted their Eggs Benedict. They didn't lead me wrong, the poached eggs, which are overcooked most of the time when I order them, were cooked to perfection! The eggs were served on a croissant with grilled ham. The hollandaise sauce was creamy, rich and a perfect consistency.

The service was perfect and never rushed. I can't wait to come back while I'm at the casino and try out their French toast,
