xcmmTXhuMx2fZF2Bt69F4w As Philadelphians, we are spoiled by having Monk's nearby, which makes stiff competition for any Belgian bar on the map. Point Brugge, you have managed to measure up on all fronts! We arrived @ 5PM and were able to get a table for 4. 3 Piraats, 2 Four Roses Sours (with delicious amarena cherries), 3 pounds of mussels (Thai and white wine), and 2 orders of frites later, we were a happy group of people!
