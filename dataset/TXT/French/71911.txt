XI3iNUgChOfJk5ppjKVEQQ We dined here for the first time ever.  Unique decor of rustic, brick walls, fireplace, eclectic decorations & dimmed lighting.  Food was fabulous. Service excellent & personal.
I had halibut.  My husband had paella.  Bread delicious too.  Charming place.  Location in Vieux Montreal.
