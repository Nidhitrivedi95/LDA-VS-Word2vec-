4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Love this place. The ambiance is very cozy and romantic. Do yourself a favor and order the chilled seafood platter.. amazing! Best filet mignon I've ever had, hands down. It was cooked to perfection, delicious and tender. We also had the chicken liver mousse pate, Roquefort steak frites (so good) and warm baguette, everything was fabulous. We'll be back!
