Rooster's boasts an American-style menu with lots of options from charcuterie plates to pasta, salads and flatbreads to protein-based dishes. There's also plenty of side options including potatoes, mushrooms, and other vegetables. I like that the menu can be tailored to lots of different needs - you could treat it like a small plates menu, ordering a number of different dishes and trying/sharing everything, or you could treat it like a more traditional menu, where you order appetizers and then a protein + side. Note: In my experience, the portions seem to be sized as if it is a small plates menu. 

I ordered a pick-up order to take back to my hotel room for dinner (the quarter roasted chicken + haricot verts w/ garlic + a bottle of sparkling water) and was surprised at how quickly my order added up to ~$30. The chicken looked and smelled delicious, but there was a slight burned taste on the crispy skin which took away from the chicken itself :( The haricot verts were very fresh and crunchy with lots of garlic on top (mmm, garlic), but there couldn't have been more than a cup or two in my to-go container. I could have eaten an entire bowl of those things.  

Rooster's is a little on the pricey side, but it's a decent restaurant in Uptown if you are looking for some fresh, American-style food.
