U2S9n1asjTTI_EvBFBNnAw I have to admit that not many places I have gone to warrant such a poor review but this place was for the birds yet I don't even see the dirtiest of seagulls eating the scrapes off my plate. I should have figured it was bad when only Two tables had customers. Hell, the only reason we picked this dump was because I was getting cranky from hunger. 
The only thing that I enjoyed was the bread and beer. Hard not to when it cAme from a bottle.  We ordered a piece of sole with almonds and chicken in a maple glaze. It was more like watered down maple syrup. The chicken was so over done that it was unpalatable. I ate as much as I did only because I was starving yet I would not have tortured the local homeless guy with my leftovers.  I ate better food out of a MRE. If you want fish that is more satisfying, go to McDonald's and buy a fish fillet sandwich. It will have more flavor and a much better value. The only thing that upsets me more then the poor food is the price of the meals.  I would give it no stars but I want people to look at this review and the run away as fast as you can.  This place is truly a blemish in the beautiful city. If the french are so proud of their food then they need to quickly shut this place down before people begin to believe French food could be so bad.
