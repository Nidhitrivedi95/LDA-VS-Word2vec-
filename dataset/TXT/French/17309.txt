Approximately 25 people fit very comfortably and there were stations with mimosas, iced tea and water, and an area for picture taking. 

The food took awhile to be served once we ordered. I got a field green salad with almonds, strawberries and chicken. The vinaigrette was yummy, but there was too much on the actual salad. The chocolate mousse was delicious and a perfect ending to this meal.
