The atmosphere is great with an authentic Parisian feel.  The patio is popular because of the great fountain views but you can also see much of that from the front dining room.  Traveling here on business, the front bar is an easy and top notch spot to eat alone.

Food: each table gets a nice baguette to start.  They have a great wine list and good cocktails (for brunch a great Bloody Mary too.) The escargot are perfect - buttery, garlicky.  The onion soup is hands down the best I've ever had.  The scallops are excellent too.

For my main course I always get the frites with Roquefort.  The steak is delightfully super thin, prepared to order, and served with a pile of crispy thin frites.  I know others in my party have been happy with their fish dishes here as well.

The staff has always been professional - clearly the managers have a close eye on everything, very efficient.  Servers have been terrific too - literally I've never had a negative experience here.

My wife and I even had our rehearsal dinner here in one of the private rooms.  They did a great job with a fixed menu and addressing one small mistake on the menu - quick as can be.

So many things change in Vegas - here's hoping Mon Ami Gabi never does.
