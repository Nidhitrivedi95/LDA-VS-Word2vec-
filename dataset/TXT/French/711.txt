_cjPEH9wXhKS-HQe_U3M4Q Let me say. I LOVE steak. So when friend Sarah l. said, "hey lets get a steak at 10:30 cuz this place sells it for 20 dollars, with dessert or an app at a certain time each night." i said, " YES!"

And to my amazement it was a beautiful Le Select. Granted this place is a fine dining restaurant and super nice, it's older location on queen was so much nicer and personal! This new location is a bit more umm.. adelaideish.

That aside. steak is delicious. specially when it's late at night, after drinking lots.

I recommend it during cheap prix fix hours!

And more so during the summer.
