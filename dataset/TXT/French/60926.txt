SD7vTf-H00J8BS3L-kt7jg Grinder is renowned for its beef meat; this steakhouse has its own butcher shop next to it. 
They have a nice setting, a cozy inner terrasse for the summer. 
We shared the famous Tomahawk rib steak, it's good, however the Burger 1855 is delicious!!!
On the other side, service was really slow; food took some time, bills took an eternity, we had to order it several times!!! In addition we asked for bread and butter, they brought us 2 small buns for a big table of 12.
Finally the waiter was a bit pushy, he wanted us to order the soonest!!
