sARavfidmIS878q5BtlyVQ After two years of half-assed (and failed) attempts at getting a table at MiniBar in DC, I resigned myself to the fact that it just wasn't going to happen. Jaleo, Zaytinia, and Oyamel are good and fine, but I wanted Fine (yes, with a capital F) dining at a José Andrés establishment only because I know what he's capable of.

Enter: é by José Andrés 

With reservations ready a month prior (through email only), you're mailed a golden ticket (http://bit.ly/1g047aD) with which you present to the hostess upon arrival. When everyone else is present, you're taken into the back room to be fed. In this space, it's just you and seven others. We opted for the beverage pairings (because duh) and began the adventure:

+Rebujito (a perfect way to begin the meal: a nitrogen-frozen orange blossom ice cube in a manzilla sherry. Refreshing!): http://bit.ly/1hAphqE
+Apple "brazo de gitano" (a light, melt-in-your-mouth, airy meringue filled with blue cheese): http://bit.ly/1kPzWjy
+Nitro almond cup (a liquid nitrogen-frozen cup made from marcona almond purée, filled with an almond foam and topped with caviar): http://bit.ly/1kSC9cW
+Bar quillo (a wafer cookie tube piped with a "whipped cream" blend of truffles and anchovies. Weird, but good--like everything else we were served): http://bit.ly/1ouuogW
+"El vermut" (clams with liquid olives that exploded with briny deliciousness): http://bit.ly/1isOBD7
+"Merienda" (basically a ham and cheese sandwich that I'd have no problem eating 76 of): http://bit.ly/1isOCHc
+Cono de la serena (opted out of the crispy chicken skin en escabeche [http://bit.ly/RrCFr8] and was offered this cheese and quince paste cone. That cheese was STUH-WRONG. Whoa.): http://bit.ly/1ouuuoF
+Cava Sangria (the perfect palate cleanser of booze that bursts in your mouth): http://bit.ly/1obgZwY Shots! Shots! Shotshotshotshots!
+"Fabes" con jamon (white beans and ham in a clear broth with two different types of garlic on the side of the bowl that you scrape onto your spoon with each bite): http://bit.ly/1obh041
+Lobster with citrus and jasmine (ran out of catchy names there, eh, José? Poached lobster with jasmine foam): http://bit.ly/1srpnIo
+"Kokotxas" al pil-pil (cod jowl in a squid ink sauce): http://bit.ly/1j7n2uE
+Rosemary wild mushroom en papillote (opted out of the foie gras with poop-smear [http://bit.ly/Rvj7BL] and was served this deliciousness; essentially mushrooms in its own sauce. It was heavenly!): http://bit.ly/1s7ITaB
+Secreto of ibérico pork and squid (ibérico ham with squid in a parsley foam. That squid was divine): http://bit.ly/1qj8rWM
+Torta ta pascualete with cotton candy (liquid nitrogen-cooled goat cheese soup, with a compressed cotton candy wafer): http://bit.ly/1isOYNX
+Créma Catalana egg (Spanish crème brûlée topped with an egg yolk, puffed rice, candied mandarin orange bits, served with honey): http://bit.ly/RrD24M
+Pan con chocolate (Frozen chocolate powder, sweet bread, olive oil, and salt. Tasted exactly like a dark chocolate cake. 1. Drag your spoon up the chocolate, through the olive oil, 2. shovel into your mouth, 3. take sips of the Ron Cremaut, AKA boozy coffee): http://bit.ly/1jl5Zdw
+25-second bizcochi (spongy deliciousness. How did they make this in the microwave?! It was so soft, I wanted to give it kisses before chomping down on it. Is that weird? That's weird.): http://bit.ly/1obhgQA
+Ferrero Rocher (a random medley of chocolates, including an awesome fizzy chocolate.): http://bit.ly/RrD0tZ

Everything. Was. Amazing. We dropped eight bills (yes, $800), but it was an adventure, an experience. Seriously, it was really great.

Thanks, José! See you at MiniBar?
