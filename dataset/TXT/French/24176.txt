cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg Can you really go wrong with foie? This place didn't. The creativity, the flavor profiles, all excellent. Our waiter was also very patient when we asked him a million questions. 

The only bad thing was that since we got a late reservation, half the menu was out of stock. Next time though...

We got the foie cromesquis, which was a small deep fried foie with liquid inside. It literally was an explosion of deliciousness in your mouth. You tasted the foie, which was surprising given that it was deep fried. The temaki was delicious- no foie (and also it was beef, not bison since they were out). It was just beef tartar in a sushi handroll with quail egg and some spice but I loved it (not surprising since I'm Asian). The duck carpaccio was delicious (also no foie) - I liked the egg that we had to mix in with it but thought it was too much egg. It wasn't a regular egg either and not a quail egg - it was big but idk what it was. 

We had the terrine with apple jelly and yes, it tasted as good as it sounds. The salt wasn't evenly distributed so the first bite seemed bland but later on, it was amazing. And a big portion. The regular seared foie was, of course, delicious. We also had the foie on top of a fruit cake. My friends loved it. I liked the foie but I'm not a fan of fruit cake. We also had the foie and boudin tart. The pastry definitely helped to make the dish. The blood sausage was delicious but the potato in the dish seemed overly much. By that point, I was in a food coma. I couldn't even partake in the dessert.  

Next time, and yes there will be a next time, I'm getting the foie burger.
