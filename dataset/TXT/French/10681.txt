My girlfriend ordered 3 sunnyside eggs and bacon and a fruit salad, I ordered the Eggs Benedict special. It was so good it was actually ridiculous. They had it for us in just minutes and only $10 a plate! 

The best part was sitting out on the patio infront of the Eiffel tower on a nice sunny morning. 

If you're going to Vegas, come here for breakfast! Just do it!
