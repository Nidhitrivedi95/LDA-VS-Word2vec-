VzLwewoXSFVLUQjHgBzlzA One of the greatest food experiences in my life (and I'm a foodie). My boyfriend brought me to Monsieur B to celebrate our new, yet deep, love. The waiter, Julien, was the friendliest foodie I've seen (he didn't make any statement, but there's no way he isn't, according to how he talked about the menu). There was so many good suggestions that I asked him to guide me, which he did perfectly, as if he was reading my soul. 

The starters were tasty, I had a salmon tartar and my boyfriend had that huge crush on the foie gras, which almost had me doubt about how much love he is capable of. The trou normand, a scoop of Les Givrés' grapefruit sorbet with a vodka splash, was delicious and refreshing. It had us renew our love for each other. 

My man had rabbit as a main dish and I almost clapped when Julien explained me what was on my plate. I never had anything called Surf and Turf before, but I'll definitely try it again I happen to read in on a menu. There was tuna, there was beef, there was love. With a side of asian slaw, well marinated, with toasted peanuts (I never thought peanuts could be that fancy). While eating the main dish, we didn't really talk. Some serious tasting was going on.

Their panna cotta had a solid reputation. We almost went for something else just to try, but we decided to both go for their classic and we weren't disappointed, far from it. At that point, we were somewhere very high without the help of any cloud, although the wine (BYO) might have helped somehow. 

Please go if you can, I believe there's no way to regret your choice. 
And to anyone giving a bad review to Monsieur B: I think you are a liar/jealous/hidden competitor.

Thank you,

- A Juliette in love.
