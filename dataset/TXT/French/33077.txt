He5snolA_enC5_7JjurQ3A This is a great place to have a date, or bring the family. It isn't super-suitable for small children (cloth napkins & wine glass type of place), but the staff is very friendly an accommodating to all ages and palates. 

The food is not 5-star french, but neither are the prices, and there are a wide variety of really tasty dishes that should be able to please everyone at your table. The food is a million times better than the big chain/tasteless places like Moxie's, Montana's, etc... and much healthier from a freshness/ingredient viewpoint. Things aren't pre-frozen or out of packages and microwaved like most places these days.

The Linguini en Passant is our family favourite with a bruschetta on the side. They do tend to serve the pasta on the soft side, so if you like al dente, you should ask for it specifically. The desserts are good too.

Finally, this is a great place to get an espresso or cappuccino... something you don't see freshly made at most places.
