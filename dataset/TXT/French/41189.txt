kGOr_D-LNpgZ2M9N8TT4QQ I had an early dinner with a friend here on the second floor patio which overlooks Bloor St. We ended up moving tables (it was almost empty and a very loud child came in) before ordering our food and our server was very accommodating of that.

The service was excellent. The wine list was also very well done with reasonable pricing and a massive selection of wines both by the bottle and by the glass.

The food is where they faltered. I ordered a medium rare steak frites which is one of my usual orders for a French restaurant. When it came out it was evidently a nice cut of meat but when I put my fork in it I was certain it was overcooked. The ends were completely brown and when i cut into the centre it was much closer to medium well than medium rare. It's a $32 meal and when I pay that much I usually expect to get what I ordered.

I asked for a new steak and apologized for doing so as I very rarely send food back. The waiter came back once it was ready, telling me that the chef had disagreed with me - the steak was "exactly how a rested medium rare should look" but that they had brought me a replacement. This was a lesser cut of meat, almost as if the chef wanted to punish me for complaining about the first steak, but at least it was cooked medium rare.

I would come back for to try the brunch, for a few oysters or for a glass of wine but I definitely won't order a steak here again.
