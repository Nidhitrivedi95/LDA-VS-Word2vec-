YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g Well I'm really disappointed with this place and food especially. I have read lots bout hubert (chef) and this place before coming here and was very excited to taste top notch food from such a famous French chef. We had few things to share as we wanted get a really good taste. 1. Warm halloumi cheese with grilled vegetables- yes the cheese was good and grilled but served on a bed of mixed greens with Tons!!! Of balsamic vinegar!!!! Which almost burned my mouth (vinegar) which took over and killed taste of veggies and cheese. Chef- easy with that balsamic or just simple don't used it at all!!! 
2. Stuffed peppers with quinoa - no taste at all. Very blended and definitely missing a taste! 
3. Shrimp and grits - no taste at all again. The shrimp were marinated in something that really doesn't have a taste at all. Very blended and missing a taste again! 
4. Wild mushroom ragout- oh my! My grandma cooks better wild mushrooms with butter than that dish. Yes mushrooms were fresh but once again no taste and leading  composition. 
I'm a person who very barely use salt&pepper on any dish as I expect to be cooked without a need to use it and always thought it is a slap to a chef when people use salt&pepper on anything but mushrooms really needed a hint of both to save some sort of a taste. 
After that dish we gave up and did not order more plates to taste (as we planned to do ) and asked for a check. 
Service was good and that star belongs to our server! 
P.s. Decor of this place was very confusing to me too. I think someone just lost an idea how this place should look like leather bulky chairs with embroidery? No!!!
