FRuuIDOd21pTJHvEGIt1Gg Second visit to this place. Had the hanger steak. It was tiny. Like really tiny, maybe 3 oz. smothered onions with an overwhelming taste. Fries we warm-ish and but all broken up into little bits. Like the end of the fryer basket. No vegetables on the plate aside from the onions. Steak was tasty and cooked correctly.

I asked for ketchup for the fries and wait s at lest 10 minutes. Felt a bit like I was in paris where they are reluctant to serve fries with ketchup. My colleague had the special which was a New York strip with mashed potatoes. He said it was good but not worth the price. 

Beer was good. 

Don't think I'll go back. Many better places around.
