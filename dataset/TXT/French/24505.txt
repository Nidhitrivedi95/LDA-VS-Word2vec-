cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg One of the great meals you can get in Montreal.  It is a must visit and truely one of the unique experiences of Montreal.

One thing I loved about it is, its not so uppity about itself, in fact it's almost casual.  It truly is the temple of foie gras, duck and pork that all the Bourdain's have made it out to be.  Which is in fact a wonderful thing.

When I went recently I shared the pigs head with someone else, just cause, where and when else are you going to get to order a pigs head?  It was awesome but next time I would prob stick to the smaller plates to get more of a sampling.  The chicharron and the fries are fried in duck fat.  You must get these.  They are magnificent.

By the way the portions here are huge so keep that in mind when ordering.
