O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q The service was horrendous and the place was maybe 50-60% full the night i went. The server seemed to be on his first day, which is not a negative reflection of him, or the restaurant, but he still seemed confused about the menu. One couple in the restaurant actually left before they got their food, due to the poor service.

I ordered a prime rib, but I am certain they brought me out a new york strip, even after the server tried to explain it away that it was a prime rib. Not a tremendous deal, but the steak was mediocre. Nothing special at all.

One positive was that the bread was very good.

I would never return and I would never recommend it. Especially with all the other options in the Palazzo and Las Vegas as a whole.
