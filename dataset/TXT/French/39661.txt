We sat down and it took over 30 mins to even get the drinks we ordered. The waitstaff was understaffed and serving to many tables then what they could handle. My friends ordered the hamburger and I got the lobster roll. It took 45 min to get our food which was ordered once we got our drinks. So by the time the food came out we had already been sitting for an hour and a half. 

The lobster roll was okay but not great for the price and my friends ordered the burger which wasn't even a burger, more like a slider, which was $17. It could've been counted as an appetizer! 

Lastly getting our check took an additional 30 min, when we finally decided to walk into the bar to get our bills. The waiter apologized and said he was sorry that he was overwhelmed and had to many tables. 

I will not be going back here again. It's overpriced and the menu is basic.
