4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I have visited Mon Ami Gabi twice. My girlfriend is gluten-sensitive so the Gluten-Free menu attracted us. I have had a great experience and a poor experience. 

Both experiences the food was great. 

The first experience our waiter was extremely nice, helpful and professional. The second experience the waitress was rushed, cold and unorganized. She did seem to have a lot going on, so I didn't hold it against her. 

This is a great place is you are gluten-free. You cannot beat the great views and the patio is awesome if they weather is nice.
