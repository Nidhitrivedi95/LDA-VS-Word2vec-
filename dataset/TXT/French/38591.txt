jLxeBgWhLRbII2ACkgH1Sg I love everything sweet, French, and places with wifi. La Belle Terre wins at all three.

I've been here a couple times now, sampling both sweet and savory fare. Most recently I had a crepe with banana and nutella. I don't think that I ever met anything slathered in nutella that I didn't like, so of course I ate ate ate it all. Peet's coffee to wash it down--not quite the tall glass of milk I would ordinarily do, but I was on a mission to stay caffeinated. 

I love a place where people speak the language of its food--French is spoken here which makes it more authentic to me. I'm not often on this side of town but when I am, this is a great spot!
