OkC86YtZ0Nm19my5F4GGrQ We are regulars at tartine. The food is consistently great. Never over the top, always nicely balanced. The frisée salad and duck tartine are my favorite. Always want to compliment the cook on superbly prepared food. Oh. And don't forget the flourless chocolate torte. Oh. And half price wine Tuesdays!! Great outside patio. Impress your east side friends by taking them here :)
