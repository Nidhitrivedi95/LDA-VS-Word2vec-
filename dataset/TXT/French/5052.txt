37kk0IW6jL7ZlxZF6k2QBg I had high hopes for this restaurant.  Really lovely atmosphere and ambiance, but the service was decidedly lacking.  I arrived a bit early for our reservations, and they had a table ready for me, but I was completely ignored until my husband joined me.  I would have loved to order a drink, but wasn't even asked.  The serving staff also forgot to bring us our additional scallop supplement... at the prices they are charging, I feel that they can step the service up several notches.  The food was tasty, but not outstanding.  If a couple is going to pay close to $400 for a meal, I expect much better service.
