JezHN-9KKLTMbojq00VP0g This adorable little place is a lovely French Cafe!  We went for crepes and tea and it was lovely.  The menu was filled with choices.  The kitchen was open and we were able to watch our food being created.  The Nutella strawberry crepe was lovely.  I saw others come in for afternoon snacks of wine and cheese-- another possibility next time.  Great location also!  #chifoodie #cleveland #foodtourism
