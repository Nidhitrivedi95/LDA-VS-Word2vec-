63in7ND_-TPVVI_J12JLRA A restaurant with a great cause and great food. This is a non-profit with volunteer staff, quite the unique concept in Montreal. Their menu is very vegetarian/vegan friendly, and very customizable. It's basically "Build-Your-Own": you pick a base (salad, rice, soba noodles) and add your protein (grilled octopus, chicken, liver, salmon...). There's also a more "classical" part of the menu (with salmon tartare, steak, poutine, etc) and an eclectic choice of sides (we got a delicious okonomiyaki!). The portions are huge (believe me, I took home half my plate!), and the prices are very reasonable. 
Also: we asked for sangria even though it was not on the drinks menu and boy did they deliver! Most generous sangria I've had in Montreal so far, I'd say!
