Where else you can enjoy superb food and a magical view of the Vegas skyline. Transported to the 56th floor of the Palms Casino yearning with anticipation to see it for myself. The massive multimillion dollar casinos morphed into the majestic barren-brown desert mountains, the scenery is breathtaking... The service was exceptional from the hostess to the friendly waitstaff.
Ordered from the pre-theater menu that consisted of 3 course tasting menu at $75, it's an affordable way to try some of their most popular dishes.
The evening started with the obligatory freebie amuse bouche. A delectable vegetable terrine with shaved parmesan and soup. The appetizers were tasty, keep in it classic with the gooey Gruyère cheese and a side of French onion soup. The smoked seafood dish consisted of Salmon, Trout, Bay Scallop, Hamachi tartare, the acidity shallot vinaigrette highlighted the woodsy smoke of the ocean basket's flavors with an added accent of a hard boiled farm egg for ultimate pleasure.
The entrees arrived via gueridon a fancy cart akin to a food limo. The chicken breast was moist and with a golden crispy skin paired an aromatic blood orange nage, there was an interesting cured egg yolk a top of the mushroom, bacon torchon. I tasted some of the decadent Filet, pure heaven. The desserts did not disappoint. Not your avant-garde cuisine but well prepared nevertheless. I walked out with a smile in my face, Alizé was well worth the memories.
