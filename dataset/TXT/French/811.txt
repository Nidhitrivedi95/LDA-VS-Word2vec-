_cjPEH9wXhKS-HQe_U3M4Q We came here on a Sunday when Mahas and Lady Marmalade were too busy. There wasn't a line to get a table and thank goodness there wasn't because the food was delicious. They have a nice patio as well. The brunch is slightly more expensive but was well worth it. We ordered the eggs with salmon and the omelette - both were season and cooked really well. Service was also good. We will definitely be back.
