QEgfK_TKY8bwK-YzKDdkGw One of the absolute nicest dinning experiences I've ever had! Great food and Great service!

I went with my fiancé for restaurant week and this place exceeded all expectations. I really don't have ANY CRITICISM. The food was excellent and the service was perfect. Very professional, polite, tentative, but not overly persistent. 

I'm a very picky eater and I wanted to try everything because the plating was so beautiful. I could describe how every dish had the perfect balance and compliment of flavors, but I'll let the pictures speak to you!
