4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Can't say enough about this place! Food was great, service was awesome, and price was perfect... You actually get more than what you paid for.  My daughter had the grilled cheese... Came w green beans, fruit (instead of fries as requested) and apples all for $5! And gourmet :)

I had the burger which was really good, juicy and tasty, my husband had an open face sandwich that came w crisscut chips?! We were seated almost outside so it was still cool from air conditioner but also had the view of the Bellagio fountains.  

I wanted to go here again in our two day stay but had a lot of places on our list to visit.  Definitely coming back next time!
