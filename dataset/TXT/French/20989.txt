AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw Service here is SLOW! Food itself was good. Everything was super fresh. I like how the chefs have their station in the middle of the restaurant so it's cool to watch them cook. Definitely overpriced for what it was though. Three of us had the eggs Benedict and one had 2 eggs with bacon and potatoes. Plus we all had orange juice and coffee. Bill came out to $140. I think the orange juice was my favorite part of the meal. It was very tasty. Also, watch out for the bread rolls. For whatever reason I will never figure out, there was a big chunk of garlic I the middle of the roll. Who wants a big fat garlic for breakfast? Gross!
