wwgRu0TAMX8rfRhsiI0ifQ I haven't had time to write reviews since I moved here a month ago, but I will also say the service my friends and I have been receiving hasn't been the best... until tonight! We stumbled upon Bistro 57 after watching TMNT (great movie btw) and decided to have some drinks and snacks. I was pleased to find out they made their own Caesar dressing and they had a great selection of cured meats and cheese to make your own cheese board! My friends got dessert, which were also pretty good! This place was pretty average but got extra points for service. Laura was probably the best server we've had in Vegas. She was friendly and definitely kept us entertained. We always had drinks filled and she seemed to enjoy making sure we were having a good time. Definitely suggest Bistro 57 as a place to relax and hang out with your friends
