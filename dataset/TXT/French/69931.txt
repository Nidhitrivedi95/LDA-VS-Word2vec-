WOj8nPos3R9IIf0Pyttd8g Three of us had dinner last night.  The tuna was over cooked and very dry.  The service was sub-par at best.  The server never came to pour our wine or offer more water and when we were finished we waited over 15 minutes for them to clear the table.  I finally had to go get someone to clear the table.  When I pointed these issues to the owner, he really didn't care and he made this clear to me.  I live in the neighborhood, and will go to Bistro LaBon next time I want French food.
