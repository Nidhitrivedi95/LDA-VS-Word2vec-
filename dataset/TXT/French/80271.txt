Patali was ok and always packed, but I felt that the poutine fell below the high standards of the city.  The fries were very thin as opposed to the potato-goodness of most poutine in the city.  And I don't enjoy the squeaky cheese curds, which Patati does especially loud.  With other options just around the block (in all honesty on every block on Montreal) I would keep walking and try poutine somewhere else.  Patati is not bad by any stretch, but it's different.
