jLxeBgWhLRbII2ACkgH1Sg I really loved this French bakery! One of the guys that works there is from Canada which I thought was cool since I'm from there. The two gentlemen that were there were so friendly and recommended things on the menu when I couldn't decide what to get.

I was recommended the Croque Madame which is a ham sandwich, in sourdough bread with Swiss cheese, Dijon, bechamel sauce, and a sunny side up egg on top. It sounds like a lot, and it is a lot, but I really enjoyed this sandwich and all its cheesy-ness!

My sister and boyfriend each ordered the Paris crepe, which is much more simple: ham and Swiss cheese wrapped in a crepe with a sunny side up egg on top. They seemed to really enjoy there dish. It wasn't as heavy as mine and a good amount to fill either of them.
