xeFVRUjxorxjO_qjX8FNdw Went there on Sunday around 11:50am, ordered a Tuna wrap, two pieces of cakes and ice cream. 

The seating is quick, the waitress is nice, BUT, everything is SO slow!

I went to the counter to order the cake, there were 5 waitresses but no one had a second to take the order. Everyone walked around seemed busy but I didn't think it was efficient. Another lady like me was waiting to order the cake, we'd waited 15 minutes at least, when I backed to my table, waited another 20 minutes for my wrap and dessert!

After finishing the food, again, 10 minutes waiting for the bill.

Overall I like this place, just took too long for everything, otherwise I would've given higher rating for sure. It's a good place to practice your patience.
