EukD4hlPZXgSMpeya5iX2g Best Veal Milanese in the city. Period. End of story. It's my "go to" place for comfort food, yet I can't get myself to try anything else on the menu as a main (except for the appetizers, of course).

Based on what my wife and kids (21 & 16) order, it's obvious that their dishes are prepared with the same love and attention as my VM.

The whole experience is like eating at your favourite aunt's home. The aunt who knew how to cook better than your mom, but you would never tell your mom that.

Oh! The price is very fair for the quality and service you receive. 

Chez Laurent is a definite keeper!!!
