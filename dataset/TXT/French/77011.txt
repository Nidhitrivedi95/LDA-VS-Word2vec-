They also offer half liters which is awesome for those who aren't gonna down a whole bottle. Delicious soup but served with stale bread. Their salmon is organic too, whether it's the tartare or grilled. The beef and salmon tartares were good, each with unique flavours, not your traditional tartare fare. This came served with a salad and fries. We also tried the braised beef which was good but not fantastic, the pro points come with the unexpected heaping delicious side of vegetables and Israeli couscous, very refreshing to see a restaurant take appreciation of the side veg. We had the trilogy dessert which came with a (quite dry and very refrigerated) carrot cake, a mini île flottante, and a mini crème brûlée. The two others were both good. The server seemed a bit rushed every time she came to our table which was a slight put-off but she was nice.
