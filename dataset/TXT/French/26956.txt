Dcj69NZJnbJhK-YHP_nULA Im tough on places so I hope this comes across as positive as I really do appreciate this place.

The food Ive had there has been decent. The soups tend to be lacking salt and flavor but are enjoyable. The frites and mussels are very good and the sandwiches are good as well.

Now to the real reason you go here: beer and wine.
They boast an impressive booklet of beer and other beverages. I love new and interesting beers and there is always something that delivers. I would reccomend beer on tap and not bottles. Beer is mostly meant to be drunk fresh and having mostly European beers means that shipping time and transfer means most of these beers are not fresh and have sat around for a while before someone decides to try that Belgian 12 year aged Abby with hints of molasses and leather.

The environment is cozy, warm and jovial and I love this place for work drinks and date nights!
Definitely a place to go and try!
