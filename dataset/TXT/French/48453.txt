OdjINFB2qGR57eWw2nwCsQ My first experience there was when Jellyfish was in its second week. It wasn't packed and we had a small meal with my boyfriend because we had to get to a concert. Since that time we always mentioned to go back there to actually enjoy it in a more relaxed manner. I wish we did not! The restaurant is full, food and service do not impress you at all. For food we ordered the crab bao, cod and charcoal carrots. First the crab came and we thought that it was okay but a bit too fried. Then there were the cod and charcoal carrots. Cod's top was literally burnt. I love Jatoba and their cod melts in your mouth. Compared to that eating at Jellyfish was an awful experience. We asked for bread three times. The first one the server forgot, the second time the bread went to the table behind us and in the third time we were already done with the food. At least the server brought it because after eating the cod and the carrots I was sick and needed something to keep me from getting worser until I got home. After the bread we paid and quickly got home to rest. What an end to the night... Besides enjoying the ambiance wouldn't recommend it at all
