Ycp3Agr7dt71TZkeKV7jng Gourmand has THE best cookie on the planet. (It's more of a cake really) It's sort of like the mystery of how they get the caramilk into the caramilk bar - how do they infuse so much chocolate inside that damn cookie?

If you're looking for something a little less sweet and a little more substantial, try the avocado tomato sandwich (grilled or not) it's amazing. (Vegans: There is cheese). I end up caving in and getting one of these bad boys 2-3 times a month, SO good. 

The staff is friendly, especially with familiar faces. I strongly recommend popping by!
