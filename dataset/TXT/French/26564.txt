D87tFO-R6U8f4-e0r4Zq_g Argh! Don't know whether to get up and order from the cash or wait for the non existent waiter. Don't ever come here on the weekend. It's too busy and they sound like they're arguing all the time in French. Waited for almost 20 minutes to get our orders in because the waiter forgot about us. People that came in after us had already gotten their drinks. Basically terrible service.

We ordered the Madame and some sweet dish, which I apologize to say I have forgotten the name of, but it had strawberries, cinnamon and sugar in it. We also order the lemon mint drink that people are raving about. The waiter forgot about us again and we finally flagged him down to get us our drinks at least. They had run out of the half liter and we ended up getting the full liter bottle to share - it was way too much for us and we ended up leaving the rest when we left. The lemade wasn't as good as everyone made it out to be. It tasted like watered down lemonade and mint.

I can see that our crepes where done but they were just sitting there for a very long time. We flagged the waiter again and he told us that only one order was done, when we specifically asked to send us whatever was ready. He came back and he told us that both orders were done already, which I already knew. The crepes were cold and dry and too thick. To be honest, the crepe was not worth the $22 dollars I spent all together. 

This place was too expensive for the quality of service and food. I may come back during the week to see if what everyone else sees in this place, but when would that be? Who knows.
