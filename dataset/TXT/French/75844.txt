ynwARDp7X2fi6hk9XCOSNQ We are exacting lifetime New Yorkers, who are used to great dining experiences at every turn, and we had an amazing meal with exemplary service.  We are both surprised to read some other reviews which were less than enthusiastic, and want to emphatically disagree and lend support to anyone considering eating a meal here.  Great pre theatre special, included a nice selection of staple french specialties, fresh salads, terrines, game and fish.  We had delicious and reasonably priced wine by the glass and a yummy chocolate cake and coffee for desert.
