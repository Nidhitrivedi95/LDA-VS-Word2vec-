aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw I've been to the Bouchon Bakery in Yountville (which I give a rating of 3) and it's much better than this Vegas kiosk. When I went last time, my cupcake was overly sweet that I could only eat a couple bites, the macarons lacked a crispy shell and tasted more like whoopie pies, and my cookie was a little too hard. Overall the baked goods at this location do not taste very fresh. It's always crowded too so the staff isn't very friendly and rushes people in line.
