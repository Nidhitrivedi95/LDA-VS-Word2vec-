4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw My boyfriend and I went for a late dinner after watching a show and loved this place. The wait staff was nice. I had the pasta dish and it was amazing! We had a wonderful view of the Bellagio water show. Mon ami Gabi is a romantic gem in the middle of the Vegas hustle and bustle. We would love to go back.
