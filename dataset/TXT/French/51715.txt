PlYrlj86zAYljZTRCBSZ3A Went out of our way to find this place because I read they had amazing poutine. Worth the traveling. It really was spot on amazing. Served out of a storage container this place is hip. $10 for two huge portions of poutine. The fries were crisp and held up to the creamy gravy well. Topped with a huge portion of squeaky white cheese curds this was a fantastic meal. 

You have to stop by!
