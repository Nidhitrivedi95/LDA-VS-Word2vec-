33Tr0eRki1Yamzleu4GMdw If cafes in France are anything like Rosallie, then I'm denouncing my US citizenship and joining the EU. This spot encompasses all the qualities I enjoy about small eateries: quaint, quiet and calming. The few times I've visited, I have been greeted genuinely and warmly by both the owner and his employees. The ambience is comforting, like walking into your mother's kitchen after a long day. The food is made from scratch and it speaks
for itself; if it looks appetizing, it's because it is. I've ordered almond croissants, sandwiches and black/green teas and have not once been disappointed. The cafe offers a unique variety of teas and authentic French pastries. Overall extremely pleased and more than willing to return. OFTEN! Vive la Rosallie!
