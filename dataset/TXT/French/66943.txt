USleI8g1UVN9-9jm-b4uIg Ah...another Charlotte staple when choosing a ultra gourmet and romantic evening.  This was my first visit to the Fig Tree and I was very excited to see what it was all about to say the least.  I had already decided on my entree before even walking in the door so I was all set.  Thankfully, my girlfriend with her grand ways made reservations during the same time they were decorated for Christmas so the atmosphere was just perfect for us.  I ended up getting the grouper that came laden in a butter sauce with lobster meat that adorned the top.  It was great!  The cheese plate we had prior was good as well but may be a bit overpriced at $17.  My girlfriend ended up getting the pork chop entrée and wasn't pleased at all with the preparation of the chops as they were a bit too fatty....shame.  I later tried the chops and I would have to agree they weren't exactly fat free but I soldiered through it anyway...ha!  The service was impeccable and delightful and the whole experience (all be it a little downtrodden due to the chops) was good enough to have me back again
