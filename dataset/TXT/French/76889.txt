ysJo5Jdo29XOBCnKrbUKWg Paris 66 reminded me of the French Cafes in Paris. Our food was excellent and prepared exactly to our order.  The wait staff was attentive and helpful, but also knew when to leave us alone.  The wine list was strong on the French wines, although I think they could add a few more wines by the glass.  Great desserts, they have a really talented pastry chef.   I was really charmed by my first visit here, and I'm sure it won't be my last.
