xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g Ou la la, tres magnifique! The view alone will swoon you.  The service is near perfect.  The food was elegant and tres delicieux!  You will walk away thoroughly satisfied.

The only complaint I could even mention is towards a patron who asked if this place served French cuisine.  Get out of here! :-P  

To get to the restaurant, you must walk through the casino floor and find the Eiffel Tower elevator.  A staff member will escort you and voila.

The service was magnifique from the start to the end.  As soon as you are seated you will be asked about beverage.  They will kindly recommend you some wine followed by a buffet of freshly made breads.  Yes, buffet! We went through a few rounds of them.  You get your classic baguet and couple of other delicieux homemade breads!

As the Yelper I am, I had to take several pictures around the restaurant.  You could be seated anywhere and still have a spectacular view of the beautiful Vegas strip and surrounding.  Be sure to get a nice shot with the Paris Ballon in the background.

THE FOOD

Started off with a couple things actually.  First was this complimentary shot of something that reminded you of a bacon potato soup.  Tres bon! Second, was appetizer--a deliciously warm sweet glazed foie gras! 

For the main course, I savored every single bite of my nicely medium grilled NY-cut steak with glistening bone marrow accompanied with a side of pillowy soft mashed potatoes.  *food coma mode*

Lastly, the Chocolate Souffle! They served it by pouring warm, melting chocolate into the souffle.  It was very moist and soft with a balanced sweetness from the chocolate.

One thing I really appreciated was them filling your glass of water each time it was low.

You might not be in the real Paris, but the experience here definitely made you feel like you were in the City of Lights.  Merci beaucoup Eiffel Tower Restaurant for a magical and elegant evening.
