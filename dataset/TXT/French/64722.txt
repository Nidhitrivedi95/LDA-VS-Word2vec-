teTQU7TIPE0O_B1zN_239w I like coming to Mimi's because it is owned by Bob Evans, which we do not have here in the desert. The food is traditional comfort food and always good. The highlight for me is the carrot raisin bread. I never order dessert because the bread could quality own its own as a dessert.

I ordered the meatloaf sandwich - it came sliced in half with a side of onion rings. I could only eat the one half. Nice portions. I noticed on the menu a drink called Pom Zero. That was new to me - pomegranate juice mixed with Sprite Zero. It could a nice spritzer - and I had about 6 of them. 

The service was very good. Our waitress was always there to see if we wanted anything and the drinks kept flowing. At times I had half a glass and one in reserve. I also like the New Orleans deco and the feel of the restaurant. I didn't notice it on the menu this time, but in the past I ordered the grilled vegetable stack sandwich - that is incredible! If it's there, give it a shot!!
