It's hard to pick a place to start: The quiche, however, is exquisite. It's cooked to perfection with perfect proportions of ingredients and  exactly the right fluffiness. Do you like Croque Madame? Oh, yes, they make the best version of this I've ever consumed. 

Don't forget the donuts with Nutella. They are thick and cooked fresh, served up with fresh Strawberries. Amazing. 

The service was a couple notches above anything else on the Strip. Not flawless, but the waiter really cared about doing a good job, and he served us with a smile.
