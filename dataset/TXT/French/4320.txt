2gUbgbdJ7IFSbicBXlSchw By far the best service during my visit in Montreal. The food was also very good 

To start we had the mushroom truffle dish which basically has the same sauce as the mushroom ravioli, so pick one or the other. otherwise, it gets old pretty quick :/

we also had the duck salad thing which was quite tasty. would have preferred slightly more greens, but there was plenty of meat which was well seasoned.

we also had the vegetable garden soup which was just ok. probably wouldnt order again

the bread kept coming and the service was a solid 5*

would definitely come back to try other dishes. ie the risotto, which looked quite yum
