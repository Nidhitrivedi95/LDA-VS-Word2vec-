Kut9tVbDX_f7qKMRRoXg3w Review is based only on the french onion soup, which guide book said is a local's favorite.  It wasn't bad but didn't care for the flavor.  It didn't have a red wine flavor but more like vinegar.  Cheese didn't taste of the best quality.  Cute place though and I'm sure other items are better!
