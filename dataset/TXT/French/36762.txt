iEsNloJgy-MyA-_wqeB6jg One of my favorite places in town with so much charm and history. Today for lunch I had the filet of sole which was light and refreshing on this hotter day. My lunch date had the lamb chops, which were perfectly grilled and seasoned. This is my 15th year coming here, so some of my favorites that are a must have are, Cesar salad, spinach salad, escargot, French onion soup, souffle and homemade cheesecake.
