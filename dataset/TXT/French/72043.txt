XKPosZx2j4RHcZ8Ewdwj0A This is one of my favorite restaurants anywhere.  I've probably been there 4-5 times now and try and get there for 1 night whenever I'm in Montreal (2x this year).  The latest visit was a few weeks ago with a buddy of mine.

The boudin maison is a star.  It's not like sausage that you'd have with, say, boudin aux pommes....it's more like a mousse it's so light in texture.  Not too big a serving or too heavy either.

Trying to remember what I had this last time.  My buddy had the magret de canard which he enjoyed.  I believe I had the confit.  Their salmon tartare is also a standout appetizer.

We started out with a red Bandol, which was pretty good.  But then took a gamble on a high-end Vins de Pays from the Languedoc.  We had the 2005 Flacon de Marie from Domaine Pech Redon.  It's always interesting to sample a wine that's made outside of the AOC straightjacket system.  This wine was excellent and I need to find a source in NYC area.  It's mostly Syrah (50%) with some Cab (40%) and a third cepage I've never heard of.  I'm partial to Syrahs and mostly drink northern Rhone but there's good value in the Languedoc.  Christophe Bousquet produced a winner and thanks to Lemeac for putting this on the carte de vin.  It would match well with most of their dishes.

If you are dining alone or with just one other person the bar/counter is also a great spot.
