8ciT6qjI18x9EPtOb-gqYQ I love, love, love this place.  It's been around for 10 years.  Just down the street from me and for some reason I just never got around to going.  Finally, in November my mom and I went for dinner.  Amazing!

I'm a convert!  I'll be a Coup Des Tartes for special occasions and just for fun!  

The food was wonderful.  Recognizable with a twist.  Fresh ingredients and really nice service.  This little place has more character in its little pinky that so many other restaurants in the Valley.  From the pictures on the walls and photographs on the fireplace to the staff.  

I took my boyfriend for a romantic date night the weekend before Christmas and it was great.  He said the same thing I'd been thinking, "WHY haven't we been coming here for years?"

I think I thought that it was much more expensive than it was.  Mom and I had one app, one salad and two entrees for $80 (including tax and corkage) and BF and I had one app, one salad, two entrees, one dessert and two corking fees for $121 (including tax and corkage).  No bad folks.  Pretty darn good actually.  It's BYOB, so we had wine that would have cost us over $150 in a restaurant, but we brought it from home.  I love it!

Standouts for me were the mushroom & Gruyere tarte, lovely and cheesy and flaky all at the same time.  The lox and potato appetizer was fabulous, and I'm not a big lox fan and I loved this.  The baby arugula salad with pears, feta and candied pecans was a perfect balance of flavors and textures.  The lamb entree is good and surprisingly, I tried the chicken cordon bleu and it was terrific!  Most amazing though, is the Grand Canyon dessert -- layers and layers of chocolate and peanut butter mousse.  Light and fluffy and rich and decadent!

Bon Appetit!
