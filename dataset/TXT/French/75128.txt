XZ7eQLjyGXf6y69UT4SGhg My anticipated first visit was delightful, I ordered a ham and cheese croissant and an apple turn over.. when I got home I bit into my ham and cheese and to a wonderful mistake they gave me a chocolate croissant! (My initial craving when I went in) Like a ACTUAL chocolate croissant they stuffed the inside with gooey chocolate and the outside was flaky and buttery.. most places drizzle chocolate on top and expect you not care.. thanks for the delicious pastries
