O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q We chose Morel's for dinner with a client - my boss had been for lunch before and said it was great.

For appetizers, we shared the Tuna Tartare and the Heirloom Tomato and Burrata Salad, both were fantastic. For an entree my boss and I shared the Brick Chicken (we have a favorite restaurant back home in Colorado that makes something similar so naturally, we wanted to try it). It was different but very good and in addition to the appetizers we had already gotten, sharing one was perfectly sized. Our guest got the Surf & Turf (filet mignon and lobster tail) which was JUST as good at it sounds! We also shared a side of green beans; they were tasty but I will say that $11 for a less-than-generously portioned side of green beans is outrageous. Their sommalier suggested a phenomenal bottle of pinot noir that paired well with everything.

We ended the evening with the Trio of Creme Brulees - they were great! Overall, the atmosphere was very nice, the service was good (the junior server in our case was more attentive than our primary server - maybe that's why they had both!), and the food was excellent. I would recommend Morel's to anyone and would love to return next time I'm in Las Vegas.
