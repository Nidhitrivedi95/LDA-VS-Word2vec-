SFnrHuVFSNiondFVUBLJZQ This place was amazing. We searched all over old Montreal for a fondue place and this definitely hit the spot. Our server, Stephany was the sweetest person ever. We had the bruschetta and French onion soup to start as well as the trio of fondue. The cheese was incredible, and the beef broth for the second course was so succulent. We would definitely return!
