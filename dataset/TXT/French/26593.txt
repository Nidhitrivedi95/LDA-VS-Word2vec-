D87tFO-R6U8f4-e0r4Zq_g little crepe place that's pretty good.  There are the sweet, savory, and sweet/savory combination crepes.

I had the 'Big Ben' with jam and brie (sweet and savory) that is the signature item here.  It was pretty good.  My friend had the nutella equivalent with strawberries.  

Definitely worth trying out.  It looks like it won a 2008 award of some sort.  The place is pretty cramped.  We went around 11ish on a Sunday.  In total, there are ~4 two-top tables, then 2 more two-tops that clearly are fire hazards and some stools to sit on.  To go is worthwhile.
