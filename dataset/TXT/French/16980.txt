9ET_RUNztevq4_OLAX80Gg I was here for the winterlicious lunch menu -$28/pp

I was seated right away for my reservation at 1pm.  When I was greeted, the guy asked if I was here for a special occasion, to which I replied "no, just here for lunch with my family to try out the winterlicious menu" and he replied "oh! Winterlicious, that was what I meant by 'special occasion" huh?!? This left me a bit baffled. If  'special occasion' meant winterlicious, why not just straight up say it.  It's like he was hiding that there's a winterlicious event going on. Oh well.....

The meal went fine.  There was nothing to rant about, but also nothing to rave about.  The price was fair for what we received.  The servers was polite and prompt with refilling our water.
