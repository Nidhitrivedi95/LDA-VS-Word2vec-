zqNgwQjj0_XAll-neGikIw Had such high hopes for this place! Yelp reviews and pictures made it look like a superb little place for lunch. When we walked in the decor was lovely. Was expecting a larger pastry selection(being used to real French cafes they have a huge colorful selection!) the items displayed in the cases looked old and store bought. Macarons are meant to be in a refrigerated case so seeing them in little baggies on the counter was quite weird. My significant other ordered a $14.95 black truffle burger and it was definitely not worth the price. The bottom bun was soggy and looked gross. I told him to send it back but he felt bad. I ordered the Brie sandwich and my salad didn't even come with the dressing or any tomatoes like in the pictures or like my boyfriends meal. He had to walk up to the counter to get dressing and we never got a refill on our drinks so the service was horrible. Won't be coming back here.
