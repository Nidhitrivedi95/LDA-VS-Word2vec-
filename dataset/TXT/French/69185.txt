w2tr0PA0b3tg8pId0kjM-A The macaroons are certainly pricey, yet I found them well worth the price. Jules offers about three dozens variations of macaroons as well as several other pastries and French baguettes. 

I've only had the macaroons which I found to be delicious wonderful. The flavors are quite intricate. The sugar is not overwhelming, so you are able to taste the subtitles in the difference of flavors; however, some flavors are quite delicate. I would recommend thoroughly cleansing your palate before trying a different flavor. 

I tried orangette, rose, pistachio, almond, passion fruit-chocolate, a honey nut blend, and violet. My favorites were orangette and pistachio, but I would recommend all of the flavors I tried! I intend to upgrade Gaby et Jules to four and a half stars if I am ever permitted to do so.
