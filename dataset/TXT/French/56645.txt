rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A For those who don't know; Bouchon is an amazing restaurant.  I have to say that my experiences here will never be forgotten, and I look forward to all my future visits.  That being said, if I could only choose one time to dine at Bouchon; it would be lunch/brunch.  

The selection at that time is just remarkable.  The fresh bakery rolls and croissants are among the best in Vegas.  Bouchon is special and makes you feel special for being there.
