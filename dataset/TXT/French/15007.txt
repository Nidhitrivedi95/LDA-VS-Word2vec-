5VCVQJE1VAslUH7xSB6w_w Lunch on Saturday, wasn't busy. This is the old Fresh To Order place.  I still miss it!' Cool revamp, tho. I don't think it belongs in the mall. This place deserves it's own space out of the mall. Server was a little slow, not very knowledgeable but nice. I ordered the sweet tea and Frank ordered a beer which was three cents less than a sweet tea. We just had apps which included  shrimp, which is a take on the bonefish grill bang bang shrimp. We also ordered crab cake  that came with corn relish.  Frank really liked the shrimp but I'm going to make it better tonight for dinner. I felt like the shrimp itself was dry and tough like the shrimp with pre-cooked before it was breaded and fried, but the breading was very good. The crabcake was one crabcake and corn relish that was a little too hot for me because of the jalapeño in it. It needed more sauce on top. The shrimp could've used more sauce and it could've been put into a better container than a little plastic cup.  The wait was really long for our food even though there were only about two or three tables. The server came back to our table after we had asked why it was taking so long and we were told that the crabcake takes long. No it doesn't. Crab is a delicate item and should never take long to cook because you'll dry it out or ruin it completely. I would come back here and give it a second shot but overall it was OK.
