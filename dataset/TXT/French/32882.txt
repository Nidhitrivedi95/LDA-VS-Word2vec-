H464UiJ5c7q5dAJ14h731A One of my favourite place in mtl to go! Surf &a turf is a must and their appetiser r delicious. Especially the squid & octopus if u r looking for a light starter. My favourite for the dessert is plum cake, but their blueberry cheesecake is very good too! Service is very good and chef is absolutely friendly :)
