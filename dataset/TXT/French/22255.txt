BSmqxPbQglQwP2R56OqOag A little loud for my regular night out but enjoy the food, service and people watching! Their Rigatoni with Italian Sausage which was simply Devine! 

UPDATE: Ok returned many times since that first visit. And, I must say this is one of my favorite go-to's. Brandon the GM is always amazing; he greets us, welcomes us every time and makes us feel special! The hostesses have been spot on and very personable. I highly recommend the Handmade Burrata which is actually their crispy eggplant (yea yuck, right?! NO) which is to die for!!! Today our server is Nicole, a cutie with a slight Jersey accent, personable and an excellent server.
