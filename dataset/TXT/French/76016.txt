ynYEgNimJOyb8dvyr9x0sA Don't let the strip mall location fool you, Le Chalet has some seriously good food! They serve swiss/french specialities, think Crepes and fondu! The interior isn't anything to write home about, but really who cares when you have food as good as they do! 
Their beer sampler is insane. A few of the standouts through out the night was their Table Side French Raclette which is a plate served with 4 different kinds of cold cuts with a basket of steamed potatoes, but the best part of the whole entree was the fact that they served it with this amazing cheese they melted table side! So yummy! The Hanging Man which is another one of their house specialties. Beef Tenderloin served flameed  table side with rice and several dipping sauces. All of their Crepes were to die for as well.  Portions were huge and big enough to share and prices weren't too outrageous. 
Worth a trip if your looking for something different.
