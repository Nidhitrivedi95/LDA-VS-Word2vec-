4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Came here for a nice romantic lunch with my girlfriend. The menu is very french, but also has some great seafood options.

I had a lobster roll, while my girlfriend ordered an omelet. the omelet was less than terrific, but the lobster roll...mmmmm....my mouth just started watering even though I ate it over 2 weeks ago. 

great wine and cocktail selection, along with a bloody mary bar during brunch.
