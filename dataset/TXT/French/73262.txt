xsFJZu4nME615byZVrpMGA It was a beautiful boutique/Cafe--I was waiting for a friend and needed to buy some Pods so I stepped in and looked at the availability of espressos and pods, made my purchase with an English lady who appeared to be uptight but she was very very helpful!  She helped me trying out the new Brazilian blend and in my purchase.  

After making a purchase I decided to try out their chocolate flourless torte while waiting for my friend.  Service was impeccable!

My friend when he came got a latte and it was a very pretty picture perfect looking latte--quite impressed.  

It was a bit 'pretentious', if you will, but the space is lovely.  On the pricier side of things and nicer than a Starbucks but still, service was wowza!
