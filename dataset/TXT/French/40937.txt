kcF-en40P3J9L8nLy5lKqQ After driving by a few times and seeing what looked like a good-sized tap selection, we decided to stop in around 10pm on a Saturday.  While the venue is pretty expansive, we were two of maybe ten patrons total.  Not always a problem for us though, so we headed to the bar to check out those taps.  Anchor Hummer, Sierra Nevada Pale, some domestics, a Four Peaks or two, and otherwise nothing exciting.  

The HH menu looked great, though!  Lots of tasty-looking small plates all for $5 each?  I know if I were hungry, I would have a hard time narrowing it down to just one or two items!  Beers were $4 and HH wines were $5.  

Atmosphere is urban contemporary, and the music/muzak I am pretty sure I recognized from shopping at DSW for boots last week.  We are 43 and were definitely the oldest people in the place.  While this isn't exactly my kind of place, I would return for snacks and drinks with the right group of friends.  It is worth a stop to check it out.
