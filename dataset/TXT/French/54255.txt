Excellent service, okay food, but not worth the price. Spent $400 ($300 plus tip) since we were there on a special occasion (our 10th anniversary), but everything was so salty I barely had any room for the food because I was downing a cup of water between every bite. Every bite was like a straight sip from a salt shaker: the bread with the fancy butter that cost extra on top of the free bread and butter, the seafood tower, the lamb chops, and the steak with foie gras. It was so depressing because I was so full from water I couldn't finish my half of the foie gras (we shared everything). The giant macaron dessert was fun. I was concerned that it was kind of gimmicky but it was a decent macaron, with crisp, delicate outsides and perfect feet.

Should have stayed in LA and gone to the Arroyo Chop House in Pasadena where they make me a perfectly seasoned blue rare steak every time, and we eat like kings for $150. Too bad Fusion closed down; their steak with foie gras was orgasmic.
