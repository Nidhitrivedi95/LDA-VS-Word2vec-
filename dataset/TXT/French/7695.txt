4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw This was our last stop before heading out of Vegas. I ordered the Gluten-free Eggs benedict. It was quite delicious. The egg yolks were runny the way I liked it and the toast had a kick of chilli. I was happy with the food and the service.

The only disappointment was the $9.95 house blend Blood Mary. It had too much Tabasco sauce and my throat was on fire. I had to down their house blend coffee with half and half to alleviate it. Extra tomato juice didn't seem to help dilute the Tabasco sauce in the drink sadly. I would say go for the self-served Bloody Mary for a few extra dollars so you won't suffer the same throat punch like I did.

Reservation is highly recommended!
