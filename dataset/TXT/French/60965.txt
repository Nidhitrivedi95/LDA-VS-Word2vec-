SFnrHuVFSNiondFVUBLJZQ Dined here while on vacation this past summer & LOVED it.  Let me preface by saying that our hotel (L'Hotel, formerly the 19th Century) was in Old Montreal...more than one person advised against the neighborhood ("it's touristy, it's expensive, it's not near anything," yadda yadda)... But we thoroughly enjoyed Old Montreal - we were near the water (summer weekly fireworks!), within walking distance from Jazz Fest & were able to navigate public transpo to other areas of town (Plateau/Outremont/Mile End, etc.) rather easily.  SO that being said... I guess this restaurant (suggested by our hotel) falls into the "touristy" category because of its locale & its "more mid-priced than dirt-cheap" prices.  Whatever... what mattered to us was that the food was YUMMY & had we had more time, we would've eaten here again!  The menu offers a wide selection of crepes & non-crepe offerings.  But we were cravin' crepes so we split a "Sugar Shack" (ham, scrambled eggs & maple syrup) & a "Sonia" (strawberries, bananas, ice cream & chocolate sauce).  Both were absolutely scrumptious!  Great coffee too.  Located off historic & scenic St. Paul, this place looks tiny & quaint from the outside but it has multiple comfy & charming dining levels inside.  Our server was attentive & friendly.  We would definitely like to return some day to try their other crepes!
