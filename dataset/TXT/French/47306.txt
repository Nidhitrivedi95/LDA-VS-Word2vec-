O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q Great food, friendly staff. In town for a trade show and sat in the bar. the couple next to us was talking about how they loved the music, wine selection and ambiance. I agree with all of that, and our meal was excellent from the steaks to the sides. Bar staff was great - very friendly and attentive. We'll definitely be back.
