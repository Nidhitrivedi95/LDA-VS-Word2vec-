eJ9L40jm5VOXCIq7xs9kQw Charming restaurant with an European feel. The general mood of the place - its dim light, pictures and wood panels / rich colored decor - is relaxed and has a certain timelessness about it. 

Don't expect very fast service. You're here for an un-rushed time.   Take your time to order your food... and it'll be many moments before your food arrives; many moments between courses. But who's keeping time?

Service staff are pleasant. It's a weekday night but the place is full so they are constantly on the move. Still, they are composed and unruffled. 

The menu has a good selection of dishes. I had the lobster bisque and lobster as main course. Excellent choices! 

Overall a lovely evening!
