oS96aJIHFWcFAlGHKKXjaw We recently had a French houseguest, and he was craving some authentic French croissants. (SPECIAL NOTE: I am gluten-free, but my husband is not. This review is based on his experience of the bakeries goods!) We decided to try La Gourmandine after hearing from my sister-in-law that it was superb. We picked up a baguette, 3 regular croissants, and 3 chocolate croissants. My husband, the croissant lover in the family, noted that the regular croissants tasted very similar to the those he purchased from a bakery in Paris during our honeymoon a few weeks ago. Flaky and delicious, they were the perfect start to breakfast! Our houseguest loved the croissants, and ate four (he was a teenager, ha). He even tried one with peanut butter, which he had never had before (nutella being the condiment of choice in France, of course). He loved it all! We had the baguette with dinner, and he probably ate half of that. 

My husband also purchased an almond tart pastry, and said that it was simply amazing. He does not normally eat sweets, so this is high praise from him. Next time you are craving some authentic French breads and pastries, make sure to check this place out. But be prepared to wait, as they do get quite busy!
