4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Loved sitting in the Dining Room instead of outside. It was my Birthday and we were dressed up for an evening out. The restaurant is beautiful and the seating was very European with the tables close to each other. We ordered the house "Gabitini" and they were lovely but very pricey. We started off with the Escargot and it was Garlicky and Buttery just like we like it. I ordered the Bone-in Ribeye Med-Rare but it came out Medium. I sent it back and they fired up a new one that was cooked perfectly. The Quality of the Beef was not very good so I cannot recommend it for the price. I wanted a glass of wine with my steak and our server made a couple of recommendations and poured us samples from the wine cart. Her suggestions were perfect and we went with a Cabernet Franc. Hubby ordered the Sole with Spinach and New Potatoes. He said it was the best Sole he had ever had. All in all, it was a lovely dinner and I would not hesitate to return!
