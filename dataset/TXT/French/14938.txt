5fquJHY2hMX9tPRD5s0t5g Went there for lunch with a co-worker.   Love the modern, wooden decor and open space.  I had the open face BBQ Pork sandwich, with fries, coleslaw and corn.  My friend had a three vegetable sampler platter.  Both were very good.   The service was good.  Quite busy for a weekday lunch period.  

Feel this is a solid 4 star location.
