33Tr0eRki1Yamzleu4GMdw This review is based on one visit only. This used to be a 7-11, they did a nice job converting the space. It's simple and spacious (maybe even a little too bare and spacious). I got a few  macaroons and a tried their la madeleine cookie as well as the duck confit sandwich. The sandwich is a bit overpriced at above $12 and to be honest, it was not very good. The duck was kinda cold and dry and there wasn't much of it.  The sweets fared better. The macaroons, though small, were pretty good and reasonably priced at $1.10. I really liked the la madeleine cookie as well. Will probably be back to try some other pastries and maybe give the cheaper sandwiches a try, they are after all conveniently located close by...
