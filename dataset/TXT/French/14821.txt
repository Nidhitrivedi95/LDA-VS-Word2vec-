5fquJHY2hMX9tPRD5s0t5g Excellent!!! My wife and I had dinner here before a show at Blumenthal. It is extremely convenient to the theater which is a big plus. We started out with a sampler of various meats, cheeses and olives served with some toasted bread. Everything was simply fantastic. Great flavors that complimented each other. You can put this sampler platter together yourself but we weren't sure what some of the possibilities were so we let our waiter Chris pick everything out. He did a great job and was very knowledgeable about the different cheeses and meats. We absolutely loved his choices. 
For a main dish my wife had the gnocchi and they were some of the best I have ever tried. They are soft and doughy like fresh homemade gnocchi should be and the sauce was wonderful. I had the BBQ half chicken and a side of au gratin potatoes. The chicken was out of this world and the potatoes were equally as good.
The price/portion point seems reasonable for the quality of the food. If you haven't tried this restaurant it should be at the top of your list- truly a great dining experience!
