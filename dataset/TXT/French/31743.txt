grHISDkIGwttYthhW8DxCQ We walked out of our way for this place because of the great reviews. It's been a while since I was so disappointed. 

We were greeted by a very nice gentleman who took our order. He suggested the chicken for my wife, as it is made fresh and not from a can, like the tuna. I got the ham cheese and spinach crepe. Both could be summed up in one word: bland. So bland that neither of us wanted to waste the calories on it. We ate a polite amount, asked for a box, and gave the box to a homeless person. 

I hate to be harsh, mostly because the server was very nice, which is why I'll give it two stars. But I honestly can't understand why this place is so highly rated. Maybe the sweet crepes are better?
