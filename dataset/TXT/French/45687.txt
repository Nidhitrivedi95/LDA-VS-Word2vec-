mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q Not speaking French and therefore not understanding what the word L'Atelier meant, we were initially disappointed to realize that we were not in Joel Rubuchon's Michelin star restaurant.  It didn't take long to realize that we had mistakenly booked the "best act in town."  

First, thanks to Joe, his fellow servers, and Rafael the sommelier, for their excellent suggestions and friendly service.  They manage to create a comfortable environment of expectant expectation, reinforced by the "front row seat" to culinary master chefs creating each and every plate with artistic precision.

We started with martini's and the Iberico Ham with tomato toast.  It was unique, delicious and beautifully presented.  We followed with the "lobster salad" a very generous portion of perfectly cooked lobster, served on a round of iceberg lettuce, both deliciously dressed with sherry vinaigrette. For our entree we enjoyed the Malabar pepper steak filet, served with a side of Joel's pureed potatoes...definitely the best rendition of mashed potatoes ever!  We ended the evening with a complementary birthday chocolate mousse, a perfect conclusion to a culinary inspired evening of some of the best dishes we "foodies" have ever been treated to!
