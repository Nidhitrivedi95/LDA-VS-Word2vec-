XgkTmVrlHHO5g96AfOAfpw Most enjoyable and delicious dinner recently .  Interesting  first courses and good entres. Chicken, fish , beef, rabbit and quenelles, a gentle fish purée in a marvelous tomato sauce. Good wine list that Sebastian guided us through.  Food a bit slow coming out of the kitchen. For sure we will back.
