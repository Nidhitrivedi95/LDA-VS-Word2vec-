4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Great food and atmosphere at a great price.  Right on the strip.  This is a great place to eat in Vegas.  I almost wanted to spluge on one of those ultra nice restaurants, but decided to be modest, and glad I did.

The steak au poivre, medium rare, was excellent.  We got the duck confit appetizer, and that was very good.  The frites are a nice side.

The waiter was one of the nicest, informative, and mindful I've ever had.

I wish I had a bigger stomach, but I couldn't even down the steak and frites.  That meant no dessert unfortunately.  But why complain that the portions are too big?
