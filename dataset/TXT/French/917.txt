_cjPEH9wXhKS-HQe_U3M4Q Went here on a Saturday night with three other dinner guests - two of whom were not foodies (one of whom was a vegetarian).  The non-foodies didn't get anything out of the place and the vegetarian was extremely disappointed.  The foodies thought the place to be good if you were in the mood for an authentic French bistro, but if you weren't, then you probably will not be wow'ed.  Convenient location for hanging out on King West afterwards but I actually preferred the cheaper places in France when I was studying there than this place.  Ah well, c'est la vie!
