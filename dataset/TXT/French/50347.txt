ovtlrcsVRlgZZQUlHs_ovw My family and I were fortunate enough to have our Thanksgiving dinner at this fabulous French restaurant. The three course entree did not disappoint. We all chose the squash medley soup, as our appetizer, which was outstanding. My sister and mother chose the turkey roulade dinner and could not stop raving about the fantastic flavors. I chose the salmon entree with which was perfectly cooked and seasoned to perfection. The ambiance was lovely, as always, and the staff was friendly and attentive. The meal itself was generous as far as proportions. We were so full we took our desert, exquisite pumpkin cheesecake, home to enjoy. It was a great decision to have our holiday meal here. When you are not quite up for cooking a full thanksgiving fare at home this is the place to go. What a treat!!
