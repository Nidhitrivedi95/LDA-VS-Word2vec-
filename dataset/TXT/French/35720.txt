hvjgF-vnPw2jyL5DBuB0qg This restaurant was recommended by a friend of a friend who travels extensively and is an avid foodie. My partner and I were in Montreal for a few days and decided to go out for a romantic dinner. We were super impressed. The server was amazing. Probably one of the best service experiences we have had in our life. Very accommodating. I commented on this to the server upon leaving.

The food was unbelievable. It's worth noting that there are maybe 5-6 options for both mains and appetizers. However, I think this works to their advantage. While they prepare only a few dishes, they are done exceedingly well. We ordered the fois gras as a appetizer and the Arctic Char and Scallop main dishes. Ingredients were markedly fresh - where did they get those capers? So good. Because I don't drink alcohol, they made me this special lemonade with a raspberry base. Their recommendation and it was wonderful. Atmosphere was classy while also comforting. Definitely would go back.
