jalA5zHW8ZfY3RSPG7oDxQ I had been wanting to go her for quite a while, and was extremely pleased.  It is definitely one of the best places to eat in the Southside.  I sat outside in a group of 5, and the atmosphere was quaint and enjoyable.  The wait staff was very friendly as well as the chefs, and did a great job of making us feel comfortable.  Sitting outside on a nice evening in the summer can't be beat, so the small patio here was perfect for our meal.

I ordered the special for an entree, and I highly recommend the crostini appetizer - definitely unique as far as crostini goes.
