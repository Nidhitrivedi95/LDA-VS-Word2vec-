XZ7eQLjyGXf6y69UT4SGhg Definitely a 5-Star bakery and the best part of it is, it's located off the strip! Yay!  As a local, I hate dealing with the traffic and the crowds on the strip  and now I don't have to! There are a variety of freshly baked pastries to choose from and trust me that is not an easy task because everything looks so delicious! And it is! So far, I've tried the cinnamon roll, chocolate croissant, almond croissant, apple turnover and chocolate chip cookies! And that was only on my first visit!
They have a little cafe, which I will most definitely have to check out now that I discovered this gem!
I almost forgot they have an assortment of macrons, too! If you love French pastries, or bakeries in general, you should definitely CHECK. IT. OUT.
