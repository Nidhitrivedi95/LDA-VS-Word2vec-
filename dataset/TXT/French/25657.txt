Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA We went here our first night in Vegas for drinks and the view and we were NOT DISAPPOINTED. The view is spectacular, the bartender was handsome and poured very liberally. We sat at the booths outside overlooking Vegas and it was unbelievable - perfect view, perfect weather, romantic, fun! Could not asked for a more perfect late night drink.... ohhh and dancing too.
