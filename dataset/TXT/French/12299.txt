4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw It must have been our bad luck.

We saw the thousands of reviews and just had to make a stop. We went for dinner and had a nice seat inside but patio adjacent, which meant a view of the Bellagio fountain show.

The food... We ordered steak and the trout. Our waiter sold us on the trout as boneless. Great! I hate bones. Well... Boneless it was not. It actually had enough bones that I had to put them on the tablecloth (sorry... really not ladylike) because I had no more room on the rim of my plate... When we told our server, she seemed surprised but not really apologetic. That said, our bill came back with the fish comped. A very sweet gesture that we didn't ask for.

Wish it had lived up to the hype. Maybe we should have gone for brunch here instead.
