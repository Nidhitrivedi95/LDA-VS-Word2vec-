SD7vTf-H00J8BS3L-kt7jg Beautiful restaurant.  

We really had great service.  They had a new menu so our watress couldn't answer my questions so she took the initiative to ask the kitchen and came back with all the answers.

I ate 2 appeteizers: salmon gravlax which was amazing and the beef carpaccio which was very bland.

Like most people, I would give it a 3.5
