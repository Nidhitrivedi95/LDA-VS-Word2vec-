ovtlrcsVRlgZZQUlHs_ovw Vogue does dining right. They take a bistro atmosphere and pepper in some fine dining aspects like their French chef-created menu, classy decor, and signature drinks. So glad the west-west Valley has a nice place like this (although they've been there for eight years now!). Even though it is a drive for us to get out there, I actually plan on being a regular at this great place! 

Started with the Fritto Misto which is essentially a giant tower of tempura battered calamari, carrots, and ginger. It was extremely good and very pretty, but I wish there was more calamari in it.

The Vogue Martini was excellent; they really know what makes a great Martini (purified water instead of vermouth, and Gorgonzola stuffed olives).

The night we went, the chef (I'm so sorry I forgot her name) prepared a duck breast special that was so delicious I wish it was a regular item. My wife had the scallop special which was also prepared, cooked, and served perfectly. 

See you soon, Vogue...
