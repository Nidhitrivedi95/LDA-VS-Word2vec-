rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Great food, great service! A large party of us went for brunch and dressed very casually.  The ambiance is very french, lol but the service were extremely welcoming and not pretentious what so ever like you may find at other upscale places.  Ordered the croquet madame; very rich and heavy, but oh so good. Tried a bite of a few other dishes and all so good. I will definitely go back next time I visit!
