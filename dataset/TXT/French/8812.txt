Poached egg, kale and bacon salad 
Baked Brie with garlic and honey 
Salmon and quinoa 
Chicken pâté 

I've always loved this restaurant when i lived in Vegas, but I think it's become my favorite one especially because they are gluten free friendly. They have a gluten free menu and are also able to modify recipes to be gluten free! 

Everything was tasty. My family even had food off the gluten free menu and they couldn't tell the difference! The gluten free menu comes with gluten free bread, butter, and olives to start. 

I'm definitely eating here each time I come to Vegas!
