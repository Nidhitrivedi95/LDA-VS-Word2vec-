Mon Ami Gabi is located in the Paris Hotel, directly across from the water show at the Bellagio.  They don't take reservations, so please plan to arrive early and put your name on the list.  Wait time is usually an hour.  Ask to be seated outside, especially if this is your first time in Vegas and the weather permits.
