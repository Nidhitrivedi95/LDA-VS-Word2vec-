Pull up a seat at the counter and watch chef/owner Eric go through his paces. Every dish is unique and every preparation comes with a heavy dose of care, thought and local ingredients. In fact, I learned of the place by bumping into Eric at the farmer's market. The real show is the open kitchen. Eric's asbestos hands will amaze you as he reaches into the 900-1200 degree forno (oven) and turns your pizza by hand or checks on the marvelous lamb... The risottos are perfectly done as well. Ours had manchego cheese and the creamy delight was topped off with a chorizo that was the perfect topping and, of course, Eric prepares each one himself, to order. Phoenix' love affair with chain restaurants just might be ib trouble if a few more chefs open places like Centurion..
