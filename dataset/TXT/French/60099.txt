sARavfidmIS878q5BtlyVQ What an amazing experience. That's what it was... not just the food, but the whole thing was indicative of a "sense of wonder" as suggested by the Golden Ticket. 

Each dish mesmerized my eyes and tested my taste buds beyond their former comprehension. 

Luckily I attended the 'show' with 2 food lovers who were less shy than I was in asking questions. Every question was answered with enthusiasm and sparked further discussion. In the middle of the experience I had to use the bathroom, which was met with a server walking me nearly all the way out of the restaurant and to the bathroom door. What service!

We had a pre-meal cocktail which was excellent. We then toyed with the decision to take the premium drink pairing or the 'spanish' pairing. I chose the spanish, and my cohorts chose premium. I'd recommend either... it definitely enhanced the experience.

I won't go into the list of dishes that were served, but there were 2 huge standouts among all the excellent ones...

I absolutely loved the charred squid... I imagined eating it like popcorn shrimp with 5x the taste.

Also the Crispy Chicken Skin in Escabeche... was out of this world.

If you have the means or win the lottery... and you love food and challenging your taste buds then this is something you must try!
