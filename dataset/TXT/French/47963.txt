O3OH5IEFMPtz7mPKakPZ3Q There are some great Japanese restaurants in this city...but nothing can match the quality, service and value of Japaneiro!  High end strip food at locals prices!

Arrived early and got to take advantage of happy hour prices, which was a bonus.  As others have stated, truffle marrow is ridiculously good...one of the best things I've ever eaten.   Super rich, super flavorful, with wonton chips on the side.   Uni was sweet and fresh...I prefer the Japanese one to the one from Catalina Island, but both are delicious.  Black cod lettuce wraps were tasty, with a little pastry dough for texture.  Chicken kushi was fantastic.  Everything was spot on.  

No liquor license yet, but you can bring your own..  server said they're in process and should have it soon.  A little bit of sake would have been the perfect compliment to my meal...looking forward to when I'm able to partake.

If you want an incredible meal without breaking the bank, make sure to put Japaneiro on your list!  One of the best meals I've had in Vegas.
