jaSowNITPRRCYpPb3_pjdA Andre's is being talked about in local publications as well as it should. At its price point its pound for pound in the top 10 restaurants in Las Vegas. 

My meal started with a cheese plate and seared foie gras. This foie gras was easily the best I've had in my life. It lit up my mouth in places I didn't know I had. We had a beet and caesar salad respectively, the beets at this place are amazing, I don't normally like beets but they're amazing here. 

Finally the entree, I had the golden trout and my partner the filet mignon. Everything was sincerely perfect and the waiting staff was on point. Exactly the right amount of service without being patronizing. 

The desert was out of this world, the pastry chef is up to any bistro in France's standard. I'd come here again. Everyday if I could. 

10/10, thank you Andre's!
