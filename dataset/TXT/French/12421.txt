It didn't help that I ordered my steak medium but received it rare. When it was brought back after my husband finished his, it was well done and burnt. Neither the server nor manager really seemed bothered. I was offered a complimentary desert haha. Hard to eat desert if you haven't had dinner. With so many delicious spots in Vegas, I would say skip this one and try Dave Ramsey's restaurants.
