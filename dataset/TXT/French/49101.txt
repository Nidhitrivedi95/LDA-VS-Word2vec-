OmFXBWLv1DoFelP2-RLqFA This place could easily be missed in the buzz and bustle of Rue St Denis, but I am so grateful that my hubby and I picked it for our first dinner in Montreal. Every plate we had was fantastic. The stand-out dish was the grilled octopus. We love octopus and have ordered it in many restaurants around the world, most of which were more expensive and pretentious than this little cafe, but Confusion had the best octopus ever. Hands down. The interior is very stylish and the swing seats were tempting, but we sat outside as it was a gorgeous weather night. The music from the piano bar next door drifted over, easy to hear and enjoy but not at all impeding conversation. Service was friendly and attentive. Overall a wonderful experience.
