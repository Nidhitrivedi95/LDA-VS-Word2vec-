rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A sorry.
this is the third bouchon i've been to and i still don't get the hype. i keep thinking if i try a different one at a different location, that it would taste better. BUT
my french toast was so-so.
i guess my coworker's quiche was good.
the croque madame was really rich but kinda bland.
and they don't do anything for birthdays. it's just a "happy birthday" and that's it.
i do love their bouchons though.
