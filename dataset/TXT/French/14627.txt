5fquJHY2hMX9tPRD5s0t5g Wonderful place in Charlotte!  Portions are perfect, staff is sweet and attentive, ambiance is lively .  Food is very good.  Even though I was there at an odd hour for them (3pm for lunch)..they welcomed me and the owner himself poured me a beer and made sure I had everything I needed.  Highly recommend this place if you are staying nearby from out of town or just want a classier break from the sports bar scene.
