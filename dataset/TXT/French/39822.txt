K2C8dSx9215LLcIzHL959Q This is our second time at The Twisted Frenchman. Our first time was during the Restaurant Week, and this time we got the 8-course meal. It was amazing! My favorite was definitely the foie gras - it simply melts in your mouth... The house aged prime strip was my second favorite dish of the night - one of the best steak dishes I've had in Pittsburgh. The dinner ended with a frozen chocolate prepared by the chef at our table - definitely a pleasure to watch and to eat. The Twisted Frenchman is quickly becoming my favorite restaurant in town!
