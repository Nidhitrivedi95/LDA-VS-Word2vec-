aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw Super disappointed with a recent experience to Bouchon Bakery.  Having had Bouchon macarons before, I thought it would be worth it to drive to the Venetian hotel, park and walk through the casino for this tasty little treat.  I had a friend in town on a short layover and had told her how these were the best tasting macarons I had ever had, including our many trips to Paris.  Unfortunately, we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was STALE. At $3.50 per cookie, I expected them to be super fresh and melting in my mouth. They were not moist, but completely dry and old tasting. Two stars because the chai latte was decent.
