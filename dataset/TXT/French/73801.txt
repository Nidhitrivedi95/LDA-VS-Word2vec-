xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g We came to the Eiffel Tower Restaurant to celebrate my boyfriend's sister's birthday. What a great place to celebrate! Our view was fantastic! We had a party of six and were seated at a round table (which I like) and were able to see the Bellagio. The was my first grown up experience in Vegas and this was a great way to start the trip! The food was fantastic!! I tried escargot for the first time...interesting! I ordered the Char broiled Filet Mignon with Lemon Parsley Butter. DE-LISH!! For dessert we ordered 4 souffles: Gran Marnier, Pistachio, Pumpkin and Banana. They were all fantastic!! Mine was the Pistachio and made sure to eat it all!! The service was very attentive and polite. With the room dimly lit made the atmosphere quite cozy and intimate. The only thing I didn't care for was when you got off the elevator at the restaurant you were in the kitchen. I seemed kind of awkward.
