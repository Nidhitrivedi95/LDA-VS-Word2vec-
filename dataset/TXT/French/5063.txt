37kk0IW6jL7ZlxZF6k2QBg $370 for two. 7 courses (fixed menu only) with an added cheese course and 2 oz wine pairings. No truffles. 3 hours. Should have been 2 hours. We were served 3 courses in 2 hours and then 4 courses in 60 minutes. Not good. Server was very professional but kitchen was slow. Dishes are very small - even for 7 courses. I informed in advance this was a birthday dinner but no special attention was given. I expected a candle at least (?).  The bill came half way through dessert. Not impressive especially after long waits between first courses and a rushed 2nd half. Flavours were very good and wines were well paired. One course was "Fogo Island cod tongues from Nova Scotia" (Uhm... Fogo island is in Newfoundland FYI). The tongues were previously frozen. They were served with a delicious ragu however. All dishes served just above room temp. No dish even close to hot. Cheeses were incredible. Mushroom consume was perfection. Chicken was mediocre. I can't imagine truffles (+$30pp) adding to our experience so don't bother. The ambiance is tight and (on this night) loud. If you're dying to go, get the 5 course menu and order a bottle of wine. You might get out for under $250. PS. Wait for warm weather. The door opens into a very small (30 seat?) room.
