LQ_gYNs5E10IGFE0NOyD7A Awesome little gem in the middle of clubby hipster ville. Nicely understated cool with EXCELLENT food and craft drinks. You really should share to get the most of this unique place. The 007 chop salad is hugely delicious, but by far my favorite are the Asian inspired ribs - amazing. Love the intimate patio vibe with cool current music. Really a great date night place that is modest on prices for solidly good food. We will be back!
