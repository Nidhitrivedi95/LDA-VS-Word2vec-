ByFBnl90Nr2T7UUwoDQ42g We were at the Le Paris on Saturday night for the exclusive beef bourguignon. All the food that we ate were really good. For appetizer we had the egg mayonnaise  and the rabbit pattie. Both were really good. Then we had the beef bourguignon for the main course and then we ended the night with the Ile flottante. We also tried the pudding du Paris which hit the spot and really made the evening memorable.  All in all it was very juicy and fabulous which I would recommend any day. It is a little before the main hustle and bustle of St Catherine street so no rush.
