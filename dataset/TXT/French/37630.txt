jalA5zHW8ZfY3RSPG7oDxQ My boyfriend and I visited this restaurant while visiting from out of town for a Pens game. We sat on the back patio which was super cute and picturesque. I ordered the daily special, a split pea veggie burger topped with kimchi and leek crema. It was delicious. The reason I have given this restaurant 3 stars is for 2 reasons: 1) the restaurant does not have a website and do not post their menu  on social media. My boyfriend is gluten free and when we arrived, there was not much that was gluten free. Even items you think could be were not due to flour being used as filler, thickener, etc. After inquiring on the gluten free items, the only thing he ordered was a tiny side of Brussels sprout salad. The server asked if he was sure that was all he wanted rather than checking with the chef to see if there was anything else that could be randomly prepared gluten free. If they were with current times and posted their menu somewhere online, we may have planned differently or called ahead to make accommodations. 2) my boyfriends salad had a hair in it. Gross. When we left, we noticed the chef had longer hair. A hair in food can happen, I suppose. But maybe a chef with longer hair could wear his hair in a ponytail to try to prevent this from happening.
