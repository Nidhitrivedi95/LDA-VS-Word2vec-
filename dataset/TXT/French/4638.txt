2QzGh0UPJVbjtRlujmBXpw First, I will say that the food here was very decadent. I enjoyed the food very much, although I found it to be a little too rich. I had the lamb, with a cream of cauliflower soup to start, and shared the smoked salmon; maybe it was my choices that were on the rich side, but either way, the food was good.

I was somewhat disappointed in my dining experience because even though the decor is quite pleasant, one of the servers continually bumped into my chair, and even elbowed me in the head at one point. The tables are far too close together and the restaurant is too crowded for such a small space. I would not have minded so much if the waiter so much as acknowledged that he continually bumped me (never mind an apology?).

Despite the food being tasty, I will not go back to Le P'tit Plateau.
