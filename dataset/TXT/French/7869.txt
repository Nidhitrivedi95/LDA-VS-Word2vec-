4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Best Nutella waffles!!  Crispy light texture.  With an airy texture.  Even the syrup and as light and not too sweet.  Excellent. 

Great onion soup.  

4 stars is for the croque madam.  Nothing really special about it.  The white sauce s little gritty and tasteless. A little plain.
