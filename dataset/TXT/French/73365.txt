xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g I've been to 3 star Michelins and I was very impressed with the Tower.  Like Rick said, it is basically a restaurant in a theme park; but, the food, ambience and service negate all of that.
The blue cheese souffle was not as strong as I hoped it would be; but, still good.  I had the lobster thermidor and it seemed that by ordering that I made the waiter very happy.  We were pressed for time to get to a show so we had to skip desert; but, I imagine it would have been delish.
When I tried going here about 3 years ago I was wearing all black tennis shoes (Louis Vuitton mind you) and I was told that "gentlemen are not allowed inside the restaurnt while wearing sneakers."
