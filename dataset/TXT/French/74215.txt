xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g We went to this restaurant for our 10 year anniversary. It is a hype restaurant and it comes with everything you'd expect in an expensive, centrally located restaurant with a theme. 
The view of the Bellagio fountains is very cool and definitely enhances your overall dining experience but it does come with a price tag.
We had the seafood appetizer which was beautifully presented and very tasty. The main course was good but not the best I've had (I went for steak and my husband ordered pheasant), and then we had souffle for dessert. Plus, a bottle of wine to top the bill. 
The souffle was good and the selection of flavors is overwhelming. It does take 40 minutes to make so I highly recommend ordering in advance - unless you are planning to spend 3 hours dining. 
You can get a picture taken and printed out ($24) and you can get a rose for your date on your way back from the bathroom (at least, that's what my husband did). 
It's romantic and very nice, with good service and a pleasant view. 
But there's one thing it's not... and that is it is not the best restaurant in Vegas.
