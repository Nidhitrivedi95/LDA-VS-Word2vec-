htQgj-ANQpZGpIpkkrEmyQ First let's get the important thing out of the way: the food is spectacular! It is such a unique spin on very classic dishes, and there are some dishes that you can't really get anywhere else. They have some very innovative uses of spices and flavours that can be a hit or a miss with people. For example, their chicken and waffles leans towards the sweet side. I thought this was interesting and quite enjoyed it but my best friend was not a fan. 

The service here is good. They've hired young people to go along with the trendy feel of the restaurant. The only issue I had was that they lost my reservation once. I had called ahead to reserve and received confirmation, but when I got there, they did not have me listed at all. Because this place is always packed, not having a reservation could be a problem. They managed to squeeze us in and gave us a complimentary pulled pork frites for the error. Now this is customer service done right!

The decor is lovely. Like its food, it has a modern Asian fusion feel. Though the place is not very big, it still feels quite cozy. Portion sizes are great and prices are reasonable. Overall, a very successful dining experience.
