rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A A fantastic (if not rather spendy) breakfast/brunch can be had at  Bouchon,so go early, like super early while the majority of Venetian guests are still sleeping. But if you are looking for a big elaborate buffet or uber fantastic French bistro fare...there are other places on the strip where you can find that.
