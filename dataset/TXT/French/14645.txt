Update: Enjoyed another dinner here last night & we tried various side items (butter beans, puréed potatoes, & of course the mac & cheese) which were all delicious! The smoked wings are a must! We've been fortunate to have Grant serve us both visits & could not have been more pleased with his exceptional service!
