m9aFZk1f8tSv248YErbpQA Best breakfast crepes in AZ no doubt! I've tried a few places around town and was disappointed but this place had perfect crepes to satisfy any palette.  I enjoy the Nutella w strawberries but once in awhile I go savory and I'm always pleased! Everyone here is friendly and attentive. And the presentation is almost too beautiful to eat ... but I get past it
