Food- yes, the food was good, more like B+ good, not great though. My dish was really tasty (filet mignon) and it had a lot of sauce added to it. My girlfriend's plate was so so, she had the salmon or sea bass, not too sure which one but it did lack flavor, too bland. We also had the scallops for an appetizer and for $26 for 3 scallops they we not the best tasting by far. 

Service- They were good too, not the best but good for their restaurant. 

Our table- the table was not the best and from what I had heard, there was not a bad seat in the house. Yeah, we had a small table in the back corner and it was very uncomfortable, I do not know why they even have a table there. The amazing views of the strip are for only about a third of the restaurant, the rest are not all that (who wants to over look housing?). 

Atmosphere- Look, if you want to have a quality meal go to Alize, but I will say this you will be bored and after you eat you will want to head back to your room and call it a night. The vibe is for someone who likes food and wants to talk for 2-3 hours after. I thought this place would set me up for a night out, I was totally mistaken. Will I go back? Probably when I feel like treating my parents. 

Overall- I didn't want to dis this place too much, but you really need to try it out for yourself. The restaurant is very nice and they have a ton of old bottles which can go for 30k each. What average person actually buys that? Go try the place out, you may enjoy it. 

Cheers
