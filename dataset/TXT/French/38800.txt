jLxeBgWhLRbII2ACkgH1Sg Chocolate almond croissant is heaven. Iced white mocha delicious and cheaper than Starbucks. Ordered eggs twice and it was still warm when it was delivered.  Cheese oozed from the ham and cheese omelette. Delivery on time or early. Missing 1 star because the sauce was missing from my turkey sandwich, but definitely recommend and will be a returning customer! Looking forward to trying a quiche and more pasteries!
