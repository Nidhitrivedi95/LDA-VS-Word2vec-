EEIz44ewHhOKmfTloAK13g The accolades are warranted. Portions are a little small (I was hungry when I left but maybe it was all I needed) but everything is executed perfectly. The dishes are very creative and involve a lot of technique, nothing seems simple, but nothing is over the top. Great flavours and textures throughout the meal. Another must in Toronto.
