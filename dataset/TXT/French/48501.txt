ohMpNug5zWNxOlL6ShG7Ig I would've gone one star, but the portions were very generous (they better be for the price though!!). Aside from portion size - my salad was drenched in oily flavorless dressing and my husband's fish and chips were a total bust: fish was burned, and the "pommes frites" everyone raves about were so overdone they were unedible (think crunchy and hollow). We didn't bother with the dessert. Cute little place, but we definitely won't be going back.
