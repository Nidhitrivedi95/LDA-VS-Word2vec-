nXlKHnArL3_vugmnytsEYQ The food was amazing. Charcuterie, cheese, and pickle plate to start. Duck liver mousse and the "Sourdough" to split as an entree. The mousse was incredible, but the bacon jam it's served with, well, you could put that on some drywall and I would eat it. The room is small but has a very cool vibe. Service is friendly and knowledgeable. Byob is nice. I will be back.
