SJo_IjvzdRtCvZVN0cbrRQ The Golden Goose is a favorite. We go at least twice a month. On weekends, they make their own English muffins, which are worth the small up-charge. All of the ingredients are fresh, and when possible, local (according to the write-up on the back of their menu). I have an incredibly difficult time ordering anything except the quiche. It is about 3 inches tall and fan-freaking-tastic, usually available in two flavors. I love the feta/spinach one; it comes with either a spring mix salad or fresh fruit. 

My cohort always gets breakfast. The sausage links are highly recommended, as well as the challah bread french toast with creme fraiche and fruit.

There is a European bakery inside as well. The often give out samples, which are so so good. The brownie is incredibly rich and the prices are reasonable.

It's kind of ridiculous, really, that this place is just a small, unassuming building on State Road. This is the place to go for breakfast in Cuyahoga Falls.

Update: I just found out that on Sundays they have the most amazing homemade crepes. We had the gorgonzola, caramelized apples and ham crepe and the organic yogurt, lingonberry and chantilly cream one. So yummy.
