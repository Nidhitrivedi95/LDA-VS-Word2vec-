This is a small patisserie and opens early, I believe 7 am every day except Sunday.  The croissants are so fresh and everything, including the French macaroons,  are baked on site.  The clerk told me the bakers get in around 1 am to start with the baking.  Well done y'all, it's delish!  They have sandwiches, meats and cheeses in addition to the baked goods.  The espresso is also very good.
