SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ This place looked great and had wonderful ambiance, but the wait grew from 20 minutes to 45 and then our group of 6 was told they were unsure if they would be able to seat us because they "prioritize reservations"... Lesson learned go early and definitely secure a reservation!
