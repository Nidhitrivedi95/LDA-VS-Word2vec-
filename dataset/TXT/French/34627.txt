HojKatUfX4UHWaPqtl63NQ It was our first time there, anniversary celebration. We chose to seat outside. Great view! Our server Christopher brought us complementary champagne which was very nice. Appetizers octopus salad and burrata (my favorite) were excellent. Bison steak and duck breast were cooked just as ordered and delish. Tiramisu was outstanding, very light and tasty. Servers were very attentive. Portion sizes are on a smaller side but very expected for this type of restaurants.  We left very satisfied with food and service. Highly recommended and we will be back for sure!
