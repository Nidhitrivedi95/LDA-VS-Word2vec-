rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Bouchon, a Thomas Keller restaurant, was central to our getaway weekend plan in Las Vegas. We made reservations several days before our trip and when we arrived we were lucky to snag a table on the patio near the fountain and nestled between the towering hotel wings.

We ordered a cheese plate to start along with a couple of glasses of wine. 

It was one of those unplanned stirring moments. The nice weather, stars, lighted fountain coupled with great wine, great cheese and great company is a sweet moment in life. We took our time and enjoyed the evening.

Next course was the special. I had the slow braised lamb shank. It may have been the best piece of meat that I have ever had. The sauce was nothing short of incredible and the lamb easily pulled off the bone with a fork. Have I already said incredible? well... it was.

If that wasn't enough, we ordered a special dessert that was a fresh berry cobbler. Again, it was over the top and like everything else that evening, it gave you that feeling that you were getting a real treat made from the best ingredients prepared by high caliber chefs.

This is the sort of place that excels in every category. Atmosphere, Service, Wine and most importantly the meal.

It was a soft and slow evening that I won't soon forget.

I can't wait to return.
