LUd3UdlUvCr54H-7ttm0TQ This restaurant seems unassuming, but serious cooking with a focus on local ingredients is going on here. For brunch I had two freshly made crepes with chanterelles, etc between them and a 'Caesar' sauce and a soft-boiled egg on top. The mix of flavours was excellent. I also enjoyed my chat with the engaging chef (I sat at the counter).  Now I plan to go back for dinner!
