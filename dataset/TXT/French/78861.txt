ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug Best restaurant in Paris Hotel in my opinion. Tried the grits with cheddar and spicy sausage and they were outstanding. The bacon is perfectly done and nice and thick with a smokey flavor. Husband and I shared a shrimp cocktail, the cheddar dip with pretzels, and a french dip sandwich. 5 large shrimp, perfectly done, cocktail sauce with a nice kick. The Sandwich had wonderfully tender beef, and a very flavorful dip. Everything is perfectly seasoned so no added salt necessary.  The staff is professional and very kind.
