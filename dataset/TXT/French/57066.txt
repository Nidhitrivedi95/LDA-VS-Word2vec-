rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A came here for dinner on a girls trip to vegas... and i must say, i think the that we are fan of bouchon!  the food was great and we were surprised that the bill didn't cost us an arm and a leg.... and the surprising thing was... we didn't have to wait long despite the fact that we didn't have a res! 

had the steak with fries... yummy!  the scallops... they were REALLY delish!! onion soup was ok... mussels were excellent!! the mac and cheese were decent... all this food spit by 3 including a few glasses of wine, tax, and tips... $70... not bad for a thomas keller restaurant! 

yea... i would come here again!
