ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug The most amazing food I have ever eaten in Las vegas. The house salad dressing blows my mind it's so delicious. The filet mignon was perfect. The mashed potatoes are out of this world. The chocolate layer cake gave me a foodgasm. You must go here and have the dinner special for 39 well worth every penny.
