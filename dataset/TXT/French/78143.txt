YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g Wonderful brunch spot. My hubby and I were in town for a concert and came here for brunch. I had scrambled egg whites with yummy potato circles and bacon. The potatoes were the best. Hubby had the red velvet pancakes which were very sweet but so worth it. All in all I will make it a point to return!
