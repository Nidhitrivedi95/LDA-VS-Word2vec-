SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA Great warm atmosphere and excellent food.  The service is exceptional.  Patricia was always there when she was needed.  She knew exactly when we were ready to order and the courses were perfectly timed.  There's nothing I cannot stand more than having the mains delivered while the previous course is still on the table.  The person serving the food even waited for me to come back to the table before serving.
