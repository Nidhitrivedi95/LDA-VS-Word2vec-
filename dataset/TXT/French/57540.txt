rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A We had a real nice meal here on Monday.  

We started with a dungeness crab salad with strawberries and apricots.  It was very light and tasty.  

We also had the duck confit which was good, but a smaller portion.

The main dish was the pork belly steak with figs and beets.  It was tasty but I could only think of my arteries as I was eating the meal.

All of this for $100.  It was a nice meal.
