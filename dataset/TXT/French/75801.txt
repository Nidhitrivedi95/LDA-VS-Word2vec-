YicI6Q2bPIEHoOD3iA4-XA Jam Cafe is one cute, cute, cute little corner bistro. The website suggests that the food is locally sourced (100 mile elk) and changes with the seasons. I was initially there in the summer when a watermelon and feta salad was on special. It was so well-done, I wish I had been able to stay for more than just an appetizer. My friend tried the calamari with a light, breading. The dipping mayo was delicious. The bread and hummus was great the day I was there. 
The wine and drink list is good. The wine recommended by the server was so good, I got a second one before heading out early for an event. 
Although there aren't a lot of seats, we were able to sit in these comfortable chairs and the table height was just right. 
Wine is obviously a focus here, and well-done, too. Wine events with paired h'or doevres are held periodically. If you want to bring your own wine (BYOW) Tuesday and Sundays during the winter are no corkage fees. So, not too pricy, AND delicious, AND local? JAM Cafe
