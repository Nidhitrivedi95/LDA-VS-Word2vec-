XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q Went there for my anniversary.  I never thought I would ever say "$1,200 for two people was a great deal".  My wife and I both had the Sixteen Course Degustation Menu and found them both incredible.  

Each course was better then the previous.  The bread is spectacular as just about everything else.

The staff was well educated regarding the products as well and the wines.

Looking forward to saving up to go again.
