rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w My wife and our family reserved a table here after our wedding day on the 15th of July. What a fantastic experience! The staff were very friendly and helpful. We don't get to eat in restaurants of this calibre very often and it can sometimes make for an uncomfortable atmosphere and a sense of feeling a bit out of place. Not here though. We were laughing and joking with our waiter and they were joining in with the banter. We decided to do the 3 course wine pairing which introduced us to the sommelier who was very informative and gave us stories and history about each wine he brought us.

The food was hands down the best I have ever had anywhere. I can't stress enough how satisfied I was with every single bite!  So much so that my wife and I phoned up a couple of days later to have another meal for just us two but unfortunately they were closed for their holidays ( I guess the whole staff take the same week off )

I highly recommend trying this place! Go on... treat yourself!
