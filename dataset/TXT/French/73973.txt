xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g I brought my husband to Las Vegas for his birthday, and decided to splurge on a dinner with a beautiful view. We were not disappointed. The Bellagio fountains danced every 15 minutes directly in front of our table at the window. Tom, our server, was top notch. The food was exceptional. The wait staff was attentive without being intrusive. We would definitely return!
