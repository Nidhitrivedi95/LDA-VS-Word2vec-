tCSlpwJQ4CZsUEMZeH2SFg I get it- but I don't get it.  Let me explain..We went on a busy Sunday morning and asked if we could sit outside. We were told to pick any table but the problem is that all of them had not been cleaned since the last customer.  We sat at a table with someone's leftovers for about 10 minutes and no one came out to bus the table.  When I went back in to speak with the hostess, I told her we had moved to a less dirty table.  Once we sat down at our new table, I knew it would be an interesting meal.  I swear we were sitting right next to the Real Housewives of Charlotte.  Each woman had downed a bottle of wine and their conversation was very loud and obnoxious.  Then, my mimosa came out with what looked like a pubic hair hanging off of the side - yum.  The food was fine but it was nothing to write home about.  Like I said before - I get it, but I don't get.  This place has a lot of potential but I could not deal with the type of people that choose to dine here.
