4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw This review is based entirely on the poor service we received. We did not even get a chance to eat because it was so difficult for them to seat us that we grew so tired of waiting and their incompetence that we finally left. 

We were told it would be 15-20 minutes for a table for 4 on the patio. No problem. We were buzzed that our table was ready only for them to tell us it was a mistake. So we kept waiting. We were buzzed again only to be led to a table for 2. There are 4 of us. When we pointed this out we were given attitude from the hostess that our entire party wasn't there (one finishing up their slot credits right outside the restaurant) and she couldn't seat us for that reason. Obviously they couldn't seat us anyway because we can't all fit at a table for 2!  

Seriously annoyed we had to start our wait all over again. It seems like we could have been bumped to the top of the list at least. When we got buzzed again, we were told again that it was a mistake! At this point it had been an hour since we first arrived so we left. We were not rude and nothing was offered to make amends for all of their mistakes. Severely disappointed because I have heard such great things about their food.
