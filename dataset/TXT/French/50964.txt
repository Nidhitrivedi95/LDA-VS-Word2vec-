5 of 5 stars (excellent, fine dining).

One of the most memorable meals of our lives.  Huge emphasis on creative showmanship and presentation.

About $90 per person, one cocktail each, no dessert, tax (15%) included, gratuity not included.

Allow 2.5 hours for the smaller of the two price fixe menus.

Simply wonderful event from start to finish. 

We had about six amuse bouches including:

-Cheese "lollipops" with truffle popcorn
-jerky on a clothesline
-cheese "cigars"
-mini corn muffins
-book of smoking smoked salmon
-assorted mini desserts


Great service and very good sommelier, Jack Grimaudo. 
About my ratings:

Only high-priced dining establishments can garner five stars.  Until yelp realizes that a fast food joint cannot possibly be ranked equally with a $100 per person place, I need to draw the line somewhere.  If we were only talking about the quality and presentation of the food, it would be a different story.  But, as we know, yelp's rankings take into account the entire dining experience.

Therefore, I divide restaurants into three categories (and I wish yelp would do the same):

1) fast food and "fast-casual", low-priced (no table service).

2) casual, mid-priced dining (table service, average entrée price: $10-$20).

3) fine, high-priced dining (linen napkins, no plastic cups, no TV's in dining room, average entrée priced at more than $20, can vary depending on the city).

High-priced dining can earn a max of five stars.  Mid-priced dining can earn a max of four stars.  Fast food can earn a max of three stars.
