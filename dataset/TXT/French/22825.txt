bzbNGyrTwWHAgg1CqkSgeg Came here for brunch with a coworker. The reviews on yelp and the unique menu selection is what enticed me to try this place out.

The service was good - they seated us right away.

I ordered the infamous red velvet waffles.  They were a little too sweet for my taste, but good. 

The atmosphere was homely feeling. It was small, quaint, and nicely decorated. 

I would recommend this place for breakfast or brunch. If I'm in the area again, I would revisit this place.
