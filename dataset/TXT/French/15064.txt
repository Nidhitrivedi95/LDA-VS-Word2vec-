63hkYvXXcZsHeCeZBQbfew Went there 2 years in a for La Poutine Week and they never cease to impress!
They use garlic potatoes instead of regular fries, topped with shish taouk or shawarma, along with fried onion and crispy pita. Sauce is vegetable based with drizzles of what I remember to be sesame sauce (not tahini).
Portions are generous, and service is very amicable. I would return for sure because I'd like to try their regular menu.  I can honestly say that they have the best garlic potatoes i've had in the city. Mushy center, but crisp on the outside, perfectly seasoned. Miam !
Only downer of the Poutine Magique was the sauce; I found it to be a little bit too salty and cold when served, but I might just be unlucky that time. 
Other than that I had a great experience . They are located within the subway... just make sure you walk right through the back of the room ;) There are limited seating but I think it's not dramatic if the customers occupy some of the subway tables..
