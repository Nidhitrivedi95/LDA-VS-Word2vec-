Recently, some work friends went to celebrate and new promotion. The ambiance is nice and so was the staff but the food, well, it is not nearly as good as it used to be!

The food was very uninspiring, bland, lacked finesse and was really just something that anyone could cook at home. When at Sassafraz, for what you pay, you are expecting top notch presentation, flavour and taste but yet, it just isn't there anymore whatsoever! 

I ordered the chicken on quinoa and it was bland, lacked flavour, the quinoa was watery and just tasteless. My friends ordered the lobster tail which looked as if it came from a can. It was limp and lacked any flavour as well. My friends who ordered the steaks were happy with them but the sides were very boring and bland.

I would recommend going for dessert, which was awesome, but skip the main course. Go elsewhere in the area for the amount of money that you will spend.
