We started off with oysters and the escargot, all very delicious and oysters were very fresh. For the dinner I had the Cassoulet and my date had the hanger steak and frites, the Cassoulet was very interesting served in a stainless steal pan with duck confit, pork, and sausage. I was a bit worried about the white beans at first, not a bean fan, but the concoction came together very well. Only negative was that the duck was a bit salty and not enough carbs to help absorb that taste. The steak frites were done well, but I've had better at Lola. To finish we had the warm chocolate brownie with vanilla ice cream, very rich and dense. 

Overall it was a pretty good meal, only downside was the over salted duck and the wait staff seemed a bit new (not knowing how to clear plates, not giving enough time to order, etc). But it's a welcomed restaurant into the Cleveland scene, worth checking out at least once if not more.
