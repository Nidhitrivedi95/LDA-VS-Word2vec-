4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw The steak there tasted better than the picture. 
Nice location, but outside was bit bright due to the sunset. 
Be careful what time you go there.

Food was amazing but our server happened to be an idiot.
Kept forgetting to bring our drinks.

I will definately go back for the steak again.
