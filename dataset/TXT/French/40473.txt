KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA Shame on me for not reviewing MB yet!

This gem is on the water (yes, a an actual, albiet man-made, water-way in Las Vegas) in Summerlin. Be sure to sit on the patio and be ready to feel as if you aren't in our beautiful desert climate. On your way out you can peruse their wine shop and pick out a bottle to accompany dinner. I like my bubbles, so insisted on champagne and a bottle of white.

I wasn't as impressed with the live music/entertainment as some other Yelpers. I think live music is very important to ambiance but my preference would have been a talent like Daniel Park or perhaps a straight acoustics musician. The man there this was a bit off his game (maybe he was sick?)

Anyway, on to the food! We ordered:

French Onion Soup
Duck Confit Salad (Favorite!)
Parpadalle
White fish (special du jour)

There is no question that I will be back soon. MB is a nice alternative to the glitz of dinner out on the Strip.
