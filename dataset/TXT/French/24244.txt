cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg When I asked a buncha friends where to go in Montreal, several of them immediately recommended Au Pied de Cochon as the "best meal of my life" but with the add on of "...if you can get reservations." 

Well, I remembered to go there but immediately forgot about the whole reservation part. However, that didn't stop us from showing up anyhow just to check if maybe we could slide by. Success!! We managed to snag the (apparently) elusive walk-in spot and were elated. 

The restaurant itself is bright and pretty, and the staff were super friendly and chatty. After a fantastic sparkling rosé suggestion from our server I was pretty much sold, we were feeling so good about getting in on a lark that there was basically no way this could have been a bad experience. 

We ordered the foie gras poutine (hey, I've never had it and we're in Montreal), dumplings with shrimp, pork and foie gras which were wrapped in squid ink and beet noodles and served with 'dragon sauce' and maple syrup (a real stand out!), and the duck in a can which also had foie gras. (So basically what I'm saying is several geese died for this meal.) Everything was very tasty- a totally satisfying and fun meal- though I can't say it was life changing by any means... it certainly seemed to be more of a seafood place so perhaps had we ordered the more expensive seafood-y stuff it woulda been life changing. Or maybe if I was a bigger fan of foie gras? (Like, it's fine but it doesn't make me do backflips.) But I'm pretty satisfied with it as just a good ol' fashioned stand out meal. 

We also ordered the maple crème brûlée because Canada- also a lovely choice. 

All in all, I think I would have been a little more disappointed had I waited months to get this reservation, but as a walk in it was positively delightful. (Maybe that's in part the bragging rights sweetening the deal.)
