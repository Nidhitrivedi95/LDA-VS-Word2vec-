vLkKorA1gPS97Zj0_WKA0Q We had an excellent experience at Twist. 

We had the seven course menu where the menu is designed around a selection of 7 wines. It's a very interesting concept and we could see the chef and sommelier discussing the menu as the wines were chosen. The sommelier was awesome and personable. She poured some rare and exceptional wines.  

The food was deliciously decadent. I loved every bite and thought the menu definitely complemented the wines while also standing out on their own. Out primary server was really good about explaining the food and pacing the courses. 

Bother service and food were definitely 5 stars. The service was polished and personable at the same time. The food was delicious, creative and presented beautifully.
