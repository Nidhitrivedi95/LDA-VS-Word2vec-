eOZ4oBegPNY5nFrX2lpGHQ Let's start with the good points. This is an adorable spot, very cosy and the service was incredible. In fact they tried to address everything that went wrong with the food but in a town like Montreal I'm not sure that getting subpar food can be covered up by good service. The prices are very good and you can bring your own wine which is always nice for the budget conscious option. That being said the food was not exactly the best. We had the 5 course meal and some of it was good but not fantastic. The soup was super heated and it made it difficult to enjoy. It was also seriously lacking in seasoning. I never feel the need to add salt but i had to here. The appetizers were just ok, again lacking in seasoning. The main meal was pretty solid. The Duck leg confit was very very good as were the Ris de Veau. The sides on the main were boring and plain however. Some sort of undercooked potato dish that seem undercooked and underseasoned. The desserts were just plain awful. We actually sent it back. The creme brule was so burnt it was black (not sure how that left the kitchen actually) and the sorbet was freezer burned and tasting like it. As I said they tried to address the issue by offering us more desserts (which we turned down, not exactly inspired by their food at that point) and reducing the price on our bill. Still not sure we'll be back however.
