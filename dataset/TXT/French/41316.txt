kGOr_D-LNpgZ2M9N8TT4QQ Service was horrible and slow but management was quick to fix that. We went during oyster night Thursdays ($1/oyster) which were amazing!!! Upon making reservations, the hostess did not state that the restaurant did not accept reservations for the oyster night as it is first come first served in the lounge.

Doubt I'd come back here for dinner as the service was very very slow.
