xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g I proposed to my GF (now fiance) in Vegas and choose the Eiffel Tower restaurant as the place.  I did the "proposal package" dinner and it turned out great.  The planning and such leading up to the night was very smooth and organized thanks to their event staff.  The actual night itself went just as smoothly.  We sat in the special corner window table overlooking the fountains.  It was beautifully decorated and setup upon arrival.  The meal was delicious and then the ring was brought out on the banana desert on a covered platter. Our waiter and the rest of the staff couldn't have been better.  I was blown away by how well everything was handled. (I had enough on my mind already!)
While a bit pricey, this was a once in a lifetime event and was worth it to me.  I recommend the proposal dinner package to anyone looking for a way to pop the question.
