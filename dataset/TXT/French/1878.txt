The appetizers that he ordered were fresh and fun to eat. The main course on the other hand were 2x pasta dishes . The pasta dishes were both awful. What seemed to be the owner offered to change our plates but actually never did. One of the pasta bowls was left untouched and the other the person with the dietary issues eat the pasta bowl with dairy because no one came back to change our order ( we were sitting at the bar). Once the bill came through they didn't even have a care in the world to take it off the bill. The menu is short and sweet and normally I'm good with that but this time around I say this place is a AVOID . Way to expensive for the experience you get .
