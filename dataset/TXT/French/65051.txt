Tl2nqtPXlLbAG3qkUYVM2g Best dinner of restaurant week!  Vincent's is consitently amazing for the 25+ years it has been around.  Never disappoints!  We took our parents there this last Friday and they were just in love with the ambiance, service and food.  2 of us ordered the filet au poivre with frites and the filet melted in our mouths with the perfect taste.  The escargots en croute tasted like it does in a 5 star bistro in Paris.  I eat there even if it isn't restaurant week, but the prix-fixe is the best value in town.

I wish some of the other restaurants in the area would take lessons from Vincent's in well trained wait staff and in consistently superb cuisine that promises to please year after year.

I love you Vincent's On Camelback!  I will be back soon with my friends and family!
