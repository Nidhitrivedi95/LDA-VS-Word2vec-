SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ I've been here before and brought a friend for the first time, raving about the place.  He won't go back.  We had very poor service.  We ordered one appetizer, one entree and one dessert and split the meal and it took over 2 hours.  We watched other couples come and go and even when we asked, we were told someone would be with us right away.  We did have reservations also.  The atmosphere is always lovely and the food was generally good, but after having such poor service, even the good food wouldn't win me over to come back again.
