4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I have been to Mon Ami Gabi on a number of occasions over the years, but hadn't been in about a year or so.

I came here for lunch recently and the food and service were not what I remember. The plates and cups on the table were dusty and a little grimey. The food was not as tasty as previous visits. I have never been totally in love with the food, but it was always decent and the location and price point made it that much better. 

The lobster roll was overly creamy and mayonnaise-y and the croque Monsieur was ok and probably the best dish of the meal. Our dining companion found a hair in their salad and it took a long time to get our server's attention to get that fixed. After that her replacement dish was slow to arrive. 

It was a busy Sunday, so I understand that they were slower than usual but that didn't explain the dusty plates and glasses. 

It's still a decent restaurant to visit to enoy the patio and view of the fountains, the food just isn't as good as it used to be.
