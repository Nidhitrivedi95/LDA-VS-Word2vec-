oZHbPhIj01_31jqD053a_Q Service of the highest caliber at Europea. From a sommelier for a wine, an introduction and story for every item that reaches your table and presentation that is so often creative and on everything but a plate.  The food is delicious and the atmosphere is classy.  Highly recommend for a special night out in Montreal.
