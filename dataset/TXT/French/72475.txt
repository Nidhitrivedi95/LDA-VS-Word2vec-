XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q I visited this restaurant this past weekend and I have to say for the money I would go elsewhere.   I have to admit that I loved the bread and cheese cart, which I thought was the best part of the meal.   However, the rest of the entrees where bland or uneventful.   I lived in NY for a couple of years and have gone to all of the great 3 star Michelin restaurants there and I think that this place does not compare to the places I have been in NY and is twice the price.   I don't really care so much about the cost, but when I am paying a rediculous amount for OK food I will avoid this place from now on.
