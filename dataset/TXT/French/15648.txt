6fPQJq4f_yiq1NHn0fd11Q Short version: $10 a crepe, fairly large, decent deal considering the size, quality, and the fact that you're in a vegas resort on the strip.

I've been lucky enough to have had a crepe from a street vendor in Paris; no one's going to confuse one from la creperie for the real thing, but it's good enough to satisfy a crepe urge (and spark some nostalgia).
