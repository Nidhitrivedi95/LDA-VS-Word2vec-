The service, from the front desk to the multitude of people who replenish your water & bread and take your order, is prompt, polite and friendly.

I had the Moroccan cured olives pizza with red peppers, eggplant, fennel and chick pea purée.  The concept is right but the recipe may need to be tweaked because it's very dry and very salty.  I ate only about one slice of it.  The braised beef shoulder with dauphinoise potatoes, roasted carrots and natural juices is excellent - the beef was tender and perfectly done and the potatoes were amazing.

Their aviation cocktail is very citrusy with a strong lemon taste.  The Tusker lager from Kenya was light and refreshing.

They have a large selection of small plates which is perfect for people with plans to go to Playhouse Square after their meal which makes Cowell & Hubbard a perfect stop before a show.
