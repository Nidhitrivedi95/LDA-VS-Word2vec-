BSmqxPbQglQwP2R56OqOag We ended up dining here because the restaurant had lots of positive reviews on Open Table - surprisingly more reviews on there than on Yelp.

Great food! I highly recommend the Seafood Linguine. 

The biggest drawback of this place is that it is LOUD. Definitely not a good date place unless you really don't want to talk to whoever you're with.

The tables are kind of close to each other too, so we heard all of the conversations around us, especially since everyone had to yell to communicate.
