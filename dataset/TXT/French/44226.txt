ME6D5nLlfG0xZCtICOYDuw Another great experience. Awesome New York Strip Steak. They took on Del Frisco's across the street with this steak. Very good unique steak sauce, perfect amount of pepper corns and just nailed the cooking to perfection. The frites that come with the steak are average.

Tried a couple of outstanding French wines that you usually do not find in restaurants. The $8 glass was a better value compared to the $14 glass

Great service
