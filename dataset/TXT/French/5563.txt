3jKUbhGSjFTv5jZ0wnW0xA We had dinner on a Wednesday night and there was only one server for the entire restaurant.  It wasn't until the end of out meal that she finally got some help, but only one busboy. The menu selection is great, but the food was over cooked. The monkfish with prosciutto and duck confit were dry and hard. The French onion soup was great and the warm goat cheese and walnut salad was pretty good. The atmosphere was lovely- great for people watching.
