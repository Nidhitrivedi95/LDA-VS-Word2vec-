Xw50tINqzrI_BM_x7_IcZA The yorkville location has been sold to someone else so this spading location is the only store that's still managed by the original owner.  I've been visiting this place since it was in yorkville and have now followed the owner to this new location.  It offers the best crepe in Toronto with just the perfect chewiness.  I usually share a savoury and a sweet one with my husband. You must try their lemonara drink as well.
