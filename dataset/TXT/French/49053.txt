OmFXBWLv1DoFelP2-RLqFA On Saturday night, I went to have dinner at this tapas place on St. Denis, Confusion. Even though I didn't have reservations, they were able to seat me immediately. There was some confusion as the server asked, "So is he parking the car in Quebec?". Uh, no, I said I was alone and I'm not the kind of girl a guy would stand up. Now give me some wine.

The place was really swanky with gray brick walls, red leather couches, colorful oil paintings, and a section where the tables have swings! I loved this idea so much that Josh and I went back the next day for lunch to try it out. The food is delicious and the prices were decent for the quality of the food. I had the homemade lamb sliders that have a strawberry-cranberry ketchup. They were awesome but there was mustard on them, which was not listed on the menu, and I'm not a fan of mustard. The impact on my satisfaction was minimal, however, and the risotto was perfect: mango, red pepper, coconut milk, and jalapenos. Yum!
