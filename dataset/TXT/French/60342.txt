SBnpT6JDbah-5l_52GM5sw Brunch. 1pm. Sunday.  I figured we were safe, there wouldn't be a wait so late in the day - "normal" people go to brunch at 10:30am, right?! 

HA.  Foiled again.  I was amazed to see how packed Sardine was at 1pm, with a 45 minute wait for a table for two.  Wowzers.  Expectations were high when we finally were led to a seat.  

I liked the ambiance from the start, warm and inviting yet elegant and classy.  A panoramic view of the lake doesn't hurt, nor does the country-style wood floors, exposed beams and linen table cloths.  

We started with cocktails (it was after noon, after all) and I would go back simply for the bloody mary ($7). Just the right level of spice, thick and loaded with all the fixin's, properly served with a  side of beer.  

Vegetarian brunch options are either a Belgian waffle or an Omelette, all reasonably priced at $8-10. The Omelette was fantastic, filled with arugula, mushrooms, scallions and cheese and served with tossed greens.

BOTTOM LINE:  I would definitely be in favor of putting this on the heavy brunch rotation. While I don't eat oysters, they offer an inviting happy hour deal ($3 drafts, 1/2 priced oysters, if I recall correctly) from 4-6pm and I love the space so I look forward to checking that out!
