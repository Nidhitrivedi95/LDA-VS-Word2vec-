rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I came here for my birthday with a girlfriend of mine and we had a blast. We had saved up for the dinner and it did not disappoint. I ordered the boeuf braise and she ordered the croque madame and both were delicious.

Honestly, I am so happy I ordered the boeuf even though it was on the more expensive side. The meat basically melted when the fork barely touched it. OMG !!! then the pasta was exceptional and I found myself licking the plate clean. The cocktails were a little pricey, but hey, it's Vegas. 
I loved it and would recommend it to anyone! The wait staff was very attentive and very helpful and very professional.
