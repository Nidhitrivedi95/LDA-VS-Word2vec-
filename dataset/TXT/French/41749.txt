KNBHGY4rQVuoHxZf_6ANuw I really loved this hotel. When I graduated high school I got an all expenses paid trip to Montreal and this hotel was part of the package. 

This hotel was much fancier that what I am used to, so clearly I was impressed with just about everything. One problem I generally have with hotels [nice or not] is feeling comfortable in the beds and with the pillows. However, the mattress was perfect, not to hard, not too soft. And the pillows were great as well, they had tons of them, some super soft, some a little firm, and a couple hard ones. I found what suited me best and had absolutely no problems sleeping. 

The bathroom was lovely as well, we had a jacuzzi tub and a rather typical shower but we thoroughly enjoyed both! 

The concierge service was fantastic. I had been to Montreal a couple times before but since this time I was with a friend we were looking for anything crazy we could get into. The person we spoke with was completely committed to making sure we knew exactly where we were going, how we were going to get there, and what to expect. This hotel is in a great location and my friend and I felt comfortable walking to all the hot spots we wanted to hit. 

Check out was a breeze, parking was not. Like Michael said, the parking garage was a bit of a maze, but other than that I really enjoyed this hotel!
