or4UVDjXEEjze3wNPjoAZA Now this place has a great menu! Came for lunch and was very happy with the food. Sat at the bar and had a nice beer and sandwich. Food was seasoned well, prepared with care and tasted dang good. It's not somewhere most people will want to go for lunch every day. It'll probably cost you around 20 bucks and that's a bit much for most. I do think that their food is worth the money. Fries were great and so was my salad. 

Bartender was nice and the place was full in the middle of the day with a pleasant afternoon crowd. It's a fun place.
