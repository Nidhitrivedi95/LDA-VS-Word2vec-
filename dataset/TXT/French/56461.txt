rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Came here during the Rock and Roll marathon 2015 weekend.

Getting to this place was like being part an elite place or something.  
Special elevators that take you.  Walking through a quiet hall, and then finally in front of the restaurant! Such ambiance! 
Venetian ambiance, very classy and elegant.

We were seated as soon as our reservation time came.  

I ordered the duck.  Very juicy and flavorful!
I also had a glass of white sweet wine the waiter had picked out for me.
Delish!

Waiter was very informative and friendly.

Favorite part of the meal was the butter they served with the bread!
WOW!
