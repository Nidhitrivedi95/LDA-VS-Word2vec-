I went here for my 30th birthday dinner and had a fantastic time. I was able to sit outside and watch the Bellagio water show so the ambiance was just amazing.

First course..I ordered the goat cheese in a marinara sauce. You dip fresh baguette in the goat cheese. It was so delicious. We were wiping the sauce in the bowl clean.  

Second course... Filet minot in a burgandy sauce.  Oh so delicious. It was the best filet I have ever had. Each bite was so amazing.  It came with frites, which you must try.

Dessert... I had their bananas foster crepes and ate a good portion myself. I love crepes and I love bananas foster but I've never had the two combined. The caramel sauce was out of this world.  Top it off with a generous scoop of french vanilla bean ice cream.

Overall, a good experience and wonderful food. I wish the service would have been a bit quicker, but when you are in Vegas and it's your birthday, time isn't of the essence. I will definitely be back for my next special event!
