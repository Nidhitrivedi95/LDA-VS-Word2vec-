7Ug8zCmY6iDTewxWqeYQ2g We went to the QG on a Saturday for the 9pm seating and opted for the table d'hôte. The starters were delicious and the mains (the lamb and the filet) were arguably the best meats I've had. The filet was made sous-vide and as a result was evenly cooked to a perfect medium rare. The deserts were great and the service was impeccable. As others have mentioned this is a BYOW place making this quite an affordable meal. All in all this was probably one of the best meals I've ever had. Highly recommended!
