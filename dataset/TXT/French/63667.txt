t1mR_Zff6Dqv1TueE2JLEA Found this place on the Internet and thought it would be pretty cool to eat while watching the belly dancers do their thing. Apart from the wonderful dancers and the interior design which was interesting, my experience there wasn't the best. I  wanted to eat out somewhere different for my birthday but I was better off going to the keg or moxies or something. The appetizers were trash and the second course meal was not the best either, my party and I actually stopped somewhere else after to eat some real tasteful food. I don't even want to get started on the waiters there who hardly came over to my table to check on us and she did and said everything with an attitude and not once did she smile. If they changed their food and staff the place would be a great place to dine
