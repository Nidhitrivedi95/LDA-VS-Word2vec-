xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g I went here for drinks with my family right after I graduated from college. The view at night is spectacular!! I didn't eat dinner here, (yet) but I will update when I do, however the service was great and the ambiance was wonderful, it really made me want to go for dinner, when normally I would avoid it thinking it was a tourist trap. 
More to come!!
