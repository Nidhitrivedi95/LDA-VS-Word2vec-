It was surprisingly light, yet flavorful and I wanted more. I also got the chicken to make this more like a chicken and waffles but I wasn't a fan of the chicken. It was a piece of fried chicken breast. This wasn't a deal breaker for me. My hubs had the shrimp and grits and they were good. We will return here and it is a good place to try out.
