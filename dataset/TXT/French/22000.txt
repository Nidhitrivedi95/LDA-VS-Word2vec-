Ordered the crab cakes, steak and fries and creme brûlée. The crab cakes were delicious and still hot when it go to our table. Crispy outside and soft flaky crab meat on the inside. The steak was cooked to medium rare as requested but the fries were a little plain and reminded me of McDonald fries. The shallot butter that came with the steak was amazing. Wanted the strawberry rhubarb tart for dessert but the menu suddenly changed so got the creme brûlée instead. Couldn't really taste the white chocolate in the creme brûlée.

Overall, would rather try the other restaurants on Baldwin St first before going back for a second time.
