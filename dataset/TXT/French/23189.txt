C3PVq7UpeHd6nz1_e-AtkA The food here was absolutely delicious.  It seems to have an Indian-fusion-inspired menu, with interesting takes on various dishes.  All very delicious.  The staff was very friendly too.  

Atmosphere:
Dim-lit, very charming and vintage looking and very romantic.

Food:
We had Scroll Eight (oven roasted chicken, cheddar, black bean hummus, mango, red pepper, tomato & fresh cilantro in a chickpea flour roti) which was big enough to share with my gf.  We also had the Pizza 2 (tomato sauce, spicy Italian sausage, caramelized onions, plum tomatoes and mozzarella on a dahl-puri crust).  Both were so unique and tasted AMAZING.

I'll definitely return here.
