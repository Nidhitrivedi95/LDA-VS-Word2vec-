Love their crepes.  Had their la sonia crepe and a latte which ended up being $20.  But oh so delicious and filling.  Instead of having it as a dessert, that ended up being my dinner.  The crepe was thick enough to withstand the fillings.  It's not that thin where you can't even taste the crepe.  And they sure are generous with the fillings.  Delicious.  Latte wasn't strong enough though.
