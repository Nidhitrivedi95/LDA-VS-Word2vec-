HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw Dining at the Cosmopolitan in Vegas was great.  The decor and atmosphere at this establishment is high energy and it's very appealling to the eye.

The location for Comme Ca is great, and has a beautiful view of the strip.  It's decor is on the masculine side, and a bit dark.  But the food was excellent, and you should try the Leaving Tijuana drink.
