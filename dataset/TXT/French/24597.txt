cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg I read the reviews of this place and almost didn't go. That would've been a HUGE mistake. The short version is, our waiter was nice, patient, explained the menu and specials multiple times, and spoke very good English. I got the duck confit and seared duck breast. It was AMAZING as was the Poutine Foie Gras.  My friend got the shepherd's pie, it was really good. And the beef tartare was good, but overwhelming for one person.  As for the Melting Pot... just pass on this dish.  Overall it was a really good experience and not as expensive as others would have you believe. But to be fair, we could only get a reservation for 5 PM (opening), which I believe played in our favor with the service. And it took three days and three phone calls to get that reservation. Minor inconveniences, but well worth it.
