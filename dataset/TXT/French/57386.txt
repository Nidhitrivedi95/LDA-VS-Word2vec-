rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A My boyfriend brought me here for breakfast in Las Vegas.  I love dating a fellow foodie, he makes magic happen for me.

He had the chicken and waffles (roasted chicken, bacon and chive waffle,
Tahitian vanilla bean butter, sauce chasseur) and I had the sourdough waffles with bananas, toasted walnuts, maple syrup & Tahitian vanilla bean butter.  It was sheer heaven.  

We both had cocktails, mine had an edible flower in it.  The whole meal was a complete treat.  I would recommend highly and return.

The wait staff was amazing too.
