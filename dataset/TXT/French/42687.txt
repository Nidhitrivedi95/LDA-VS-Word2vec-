LjOBNcNNpuewBqSPxYYTJQ Last night was the first and last time I will ever eat at Amelie's. To start off, the staff were rude and very unfriendly. I ordered a cream puff that was nearly five dollars and have been throwing up all night due to food poisoning. If you ever visit this bakery, I highly suggest ordering an item that doesn't contain cream. Harris Teeter sells equal if not better deserts than Amelie's and I am sure they do not feed their customers spoiled food.
