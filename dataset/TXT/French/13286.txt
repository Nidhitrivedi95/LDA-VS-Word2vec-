4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I came here on my birthday and ordered the escargot with garlic-herb butter for $17 and bordelaise steak frites for $30.

The escargot was drenched in the garlic-herb butter (yum!) and was fresh. I only wish they gave more than 6 pieces :D

I wasn't a fan of the frites but the steak itself with the red wine sauce and carmelized onions made it amazing.

To the other people who said their steaks were thin - order the filet mignon or the rib eye next time!

TIP: If the weather is permitting, ask to sit outdoors with a view of Bellagio's fountain. It's so pretty at night!

The view, ambiance, service, and food were all up to par and the reviews justify the magnificence of this place~
