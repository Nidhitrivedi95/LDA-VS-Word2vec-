Our server was quite serious and professional but we had a good time poking fun with him all night.  Definitely make a reservation as this place gets crowded.  Ask for the bar if tables are full because there are some bar tables that work quite well too!  The food here is truly magnificent - you won't go wrong just ordering it from their daily menu.  I enjoyed every bite of my food and my friend's plates too!  The dark lighting is romantic or it could be a good place to treat your best friend to a nice dinner.
