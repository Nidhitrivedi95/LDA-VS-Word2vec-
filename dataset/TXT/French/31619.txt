gjCmXkMNVE0JSk8puUwv6g I was initially disappointed with the menu- there were only a few things for vegetarians. The menu is pretty small with not much descriptions. I admit that I was ready to be disappointed. We ordered the salmon sandwich, ratatoille rolls, broccoli guac, and the zucchini. EVERYTHING. WAS. SO. GOOD.  I feel like you have to leave American expectations at the door with this place. No, its not quite what you're used to. And yes, that's a very good thing. And yes, make sure you get dessert- the cream puffs are A-Maz-ing.
