el-3IdlW3bTCSnquLvH-3w La Petite France was good, but not great.  We tried a wide and assorted sampling of the menu and yes, the flammenkueche was very good, but everything else from food to service to atmosphere was just 3 stars in my opinion.  Please spare me the "you just don't get it" comments.  I won't be back to give them another try sadly, but if you go be sure to avoid that chicken panini!
