lQ9VmIWvM6v-rONPkYX8aQ This is my all time favorite restaurant.  I've spent more money at French Laundry, Taillevent, and Robuchon and I firmly believe Alex's tasting menu is the best of all of them.

The ambiance is dark and decadent, a welcome respite from the flash of the strip, and the service is warm and impeccable.  My first time in I went for my birthday.  My husband and I were having such a hard time deciding between the tasting menu and the a la carte menu- literally EVERYTHING looked amazing, and that almost never happens to me.  When we mentioned this to the waiter, he graciously offered to alter one of our meals to include various things from the a la carte menu so we could try nearly one of everything.  What resulted was possibly the best meal of my life.

I went back 8 months later and booked a private room with a party of 10.  We had another mindblowing meal and the busboy remembered us from before- I love the service here, it's flawless but not stuffy.  I will definitely be back.
