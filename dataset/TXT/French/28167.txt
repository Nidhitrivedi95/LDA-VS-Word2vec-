E9HkUYYO_-5vKjvBwLuDIw Amazing! I hesitate to write this review because I don't want people taking up seats and reservations before we can get to them. Cannot say enough wonderful things about this place.  We are So happy that we have found another place with a "local feel"... No video poker, no smoking indoors, not a chain. The service was beyond amazing, very upbeat staff and owner. The wine and food are unique and well priced. Lastly, the atmosphere was so pleasant. We will definitely be back.
