Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA Looking forward to a spectacular view, we went to Mix for cocktails on a Wednesday night. The lounge is very cool especially the outdoor section that looks over the strip and there are plenty of booths facing outward to admire the view as well as these strange little cement booth things with cement table between two. 

My husband and I sat in the aforementioned "booth" and found that while they were comfortable, you are siting so far away from your companion that you have to practically yell to talk. We ended up sharing a single side and found it much more enjoyable. 

I had a glass of cava which had both bubbles and booze, so I was happy. My husband had a pomegranate manhattan which was surprisingly good. Not too sweet and very well balanced, so he was happy. 

We also participated in the nightly toast which could have been cool but the "champagne" was warm and flat. IMO, if you are going to offer something to your guests, it shouldn't suck. I would rather not have had it at all. 

After our single round of drinks, we left as the crowd was older and once you saw the lights and took some pics, there wasn't a whole lot left to do. Overall, I would suggest riding the elevator up, taking some pictures when you walk in and leaving to have drinks somewhere else.
