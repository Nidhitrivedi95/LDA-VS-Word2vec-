58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw Located on a broad yet quiet stretch of McGill near the Old City, Le Cartet looks like jumps straight out of the pages of a travel guide.  It's a big lofty space with crafty art pieces hanging on white brick walls, with lamps hanging down from the ceiling.  Diners are packed close together at small tables or at one of the larger communal ones.  With a small market boutique in the front and the restaurant operation in the back, it practically screams twee, but the food is good and the service is quick.

After waiting for 20-30 minutes to sit down, I ordered the Atlantic breakfast platter, while the BF opted for the Sweet.  Both of our plates included coffee (and a mimosa for a few bucks more), as well as an avalanche of food.  My dish included scrambled eggs with smoked salmon, half a bagel dressed with lox, cream cheese, onions, and capers, a mesclun salad, fruit, and a salmon croquette, and it was more than enough.  Everything tasted really good on the whole, although the croquette was a bit dry and crusty.  His dish included crepes, french toast, fruit, and yogurt with granola.  The crepes were very good; not too sweet but just the right amount.  The french toast was not nearly as tender as I normally like (tasted a bit dry), but the subtle addition of the nuts, as well as the applesauce, added a bit of complexity.

The menu is varied enough without being overwhelming, and the vibe is very mixed.  There are young people, old people, families, couples, and singles.  Considering what we ordered, the prices are pretty reasonable.  My only complaints would be the lack space available for people to wait for tables, as well as eating in.  It also may be a bit noisy if you're trying to carry on a conversation.  But otherwise, this is a perfectly fine brunch spot with good food and a great atmosphere/scene.
