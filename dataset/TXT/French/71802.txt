XgkTmVrlHHO5g96AfOAfpw You are all sleeping on the happy hour here. They have several beers available for $2, and $2 jager shots (M-F, 5-7). You're welcome.

...But if you decide for some reason that you're "an adult" and too good for taking multiple shots of jager on weekday afternoons, I suppose you might like to know that they also make quality cocktails in this surprisingly huge, well-appointed French restaurant.

Although I haven't had the pleasure of a full meal yet, the onion soup gratineé and the cassoulet are solid, and as an added bonus, served with great bread and a honey butter.

Do it.
