Maybe I'm too picky; they already have 4 branches across Edinburgh and one in Aberdeen, so they're obviously doing something right. I'd say this is most likely to be down to the the emphasis placed on local ingredients from local suppliers. For example, in my Trio Of Seafood starter, the "fragrant poached salmon" that came alongside the pickled herring and seared scallops was one of the nicest bits of salmon I've tasted in a long time. Likewise, my main course of Lamb Rump was sourced from the scottish borders and was extremely well-cooked.

That aside, when you scan down the menu you can't help but think that none of the dishes are particularly any different to what you'd find in any british restaurant, regardless of where the actual ingredients come from: other options for main course were a beef steak burger with blue cheese served with chips, or a butternut squash gnocchi dish served with grated parmesan on top... hardly anything hugely imaginative and yet you'll still pay up to £17 for a main/£7 for a starter.

Don't get me wrong, both times I've eaten here have been good. It's just that "good" is about as excited as you can get. In somewhere like Bruntsfield, which has so many restaurants, bistros and brasseries, Howies does seem to fade from your memory fairly quickly after you leave.
