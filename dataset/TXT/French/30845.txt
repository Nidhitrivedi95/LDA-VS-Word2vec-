fyJAqmweGm8VXnpU4CWGNw Me and my faithful bestie Ray hit up French Grocery for the 1st time for lunch today, being as we both love anything French! The place itself is very clean with a good amount of tables to sit at. I liked the different Wines they sold, it made me want to buy a bottle and drink some, but it was lunch and we had to get back to work. We went to the counter to order and  the guy behind the counter was nice but for our 1st time there I wish he would of been a bit more friendly and helpful, he did answer all my questions but I just thought he would of been a bit more friendly. We both ordered the speical  which was the Mozz, tomato, pesto sandwich and side of potato leek soup. It was all very good, a bit pricey but very fresh and good. I do have one suggestion, I do wish they sold more made to order food. The only sandwiches available that were made to order were ours and a grilled cheese with french onion. All other sandwiches were premade and put in their case, which was very odd to me. I think they would do better with more fresh made to order things. The bakery items looked delish, but they were out of a lot of things. I did take a Chocolate Chili Macaroon back to my office which I LOVED! I have never had one before! Very good suggestion made by the guy behind the counter.  All in all it was a good experience and I will be back! I do want to stop in before work to try the coffee and pick up a sweet!
