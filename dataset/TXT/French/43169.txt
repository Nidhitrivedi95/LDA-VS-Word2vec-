lQ9VmIWvM6v-rONPkYX8aQ Alex was my first 2 Michelin Star dining experience and I must say I was quite pleased.  The decor of the restaurant seemed very high class and the atmosphere was very pleasant.  The grand stairway itself made you feel like you were royalty.

I came here celebrating my two year anniversary with my gf and we each got the tasting menu for the night which included a prawn carpaccio, maine lobster and sea urchin linguini, foie gras, dover sole with a tiny salad, wagyu beef, coconut tapioca, and a toasted vanilla brioche with butter poached apples and maple ice cream.

The dinner started off with an amuse bouche plate with consisted of a beef tartare, a duck cookie like thing, smoked salmon, a broccoli soup, and a cheese cracker.  That sure got my taste buds started.  The bread selection here was very good.  I really liked the cheese walnut break and the gf liked the raisin bread.

The lobster linguini was really really good.  Large chunks of lobster with this sauce that just made it absolutely delicious.  They gave a very generous slab of foie gras as well.  Dover sole is...just dover sole, but the wagyu beef strips were delicious (when is wagyu beef not delicious?)

Because we were celebrating our anniversary the chef made a special dessert cake for us.  Alex also gave us madelines at the end of dinner along with petit fours and macaroons.

Alex is VERY pricey though..$185/person for the tasting menu.  The food I felt wasn't a huge step up from some of the other 1 Michelin star restaurants I've been to.  But the service is excellent and food is still delicious.  Definitely only come here if you're celebrating something VERY special.
