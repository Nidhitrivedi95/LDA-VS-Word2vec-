S50I4XsBmsWP1PNr_Q-StA Nipped in here for lunch on a Sunday afternoon, it was busy, I'm not surprised! the 2 or 3 course set menus seemed like great value, and it really was.
Nice little salad, bread, olives and salami arrived free, which was a lovely  touch. The steak and fries with mushroom sauce  I had was delish, and the turkish delight icecream was good too.  With friendly efficient service, all in all it was a very enjoyable lunch.
