The restaurant decor is very nice, I did like the bar it was beautifully done.

Came in for brunch. Asked if they had iced coffee, (which in fairness I thought was a done deal because you have a cocktail on the menu made with cold brew coffee..) but was given a quizzical look by the waitress and told no. Ok.. Can I have a coffee and a glass of ice please? 

Ordered the short rib hash, and the more I thought about it, the more I was like what an ingenious way for a restaurant to pawn off their leftovers. Which is kinda what the short ribs tasted like, leftovers. They were good leftovers, but the hash was very salty and lacked much depth otherwise. The eggs were of high quality which was apparent by their color.

The bruleed bacon was delicious, thick cut and not too sweet.

I also enjoyed the vegetables that came with my husband's pork belly. Those carrots were good.

The pig theme is very cute, especially the piggy paperclips with the bill.
