My son and I jumped into a plate of yellowtail and hamachi with Japanese sauce, and another with duck (yes, it is also raw) with the Italian sauce - both were outstanding.  We also ordered their absolutely amazing edamame, and my son ordered the tuna burger, which was good, but not great.  The service was super friendly and attentive.  It was a bit loud, but the music was great and upbeat, and it was not so loud that we couldn't carry on a conversation.  I think we need one of these in Phoenix!
