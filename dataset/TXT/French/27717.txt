DOmVF9YKOvTkqjcgUwtOgQ Had a great experience! Went for brunch on a Saturday morning. The resto is large but had a warm, cosy ambiance. We found the service just excellent.  Jean Sebastian was very friendly and informative. He had great energy and the food was superb. They smoke their own bacon. Outstanding. House made jams also delicious!
