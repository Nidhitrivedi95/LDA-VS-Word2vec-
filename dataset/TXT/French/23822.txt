cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg May be it was the wine, but with every bite, I heard angels singing "Halleluja" in my head.  3 dishes for 2 people

Appetizer:  special of the day.  foie gras served over a blini with a mushroom corn sauce on the side.
Main course:  duck in a can, yes, you read about it.  I was amazed with how flavorful and tender the vegetables were.
Chocolate pot de creme: topped with whipped cream and crumbs

Great service and good beer/wine selection
