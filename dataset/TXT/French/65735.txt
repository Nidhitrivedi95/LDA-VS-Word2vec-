U8ou87Xc3MWiDnmGB3U6mg The Croque Madame was lacking in flavor and they skimped on ingredients (from the béchamel sauce to the cheese on the bread). The side potatoes were cold and mushy. For $14, I expect more of an effort. The restaurant also had that low ambient cooler noise that made it seem more like a cafeteria than a cozy french bistro. We won't be back.
