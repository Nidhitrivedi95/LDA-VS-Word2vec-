d482l58ho0_IMdFkXX1F5Q what a WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE!! impeccable service from the staff (maître d', server AND bus boys). such a pleasing atmosphere. special thank you to the chef for sending my table a complimentary burrata. 
my party started with the stone oven flat bread that was so light, creamy and cheesy. i ordered the linguini de sud: pasta with clams & shrimp. desert was AMAZING! i ordered the black & white fondant, which is the molten chocolate cake with verbena ice cream.
