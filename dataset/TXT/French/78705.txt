While wandering Paris Casino looking for a place to have brunch/lunch we stumbled upon this one and got ourselves a table on the 'courtyard' section.  Nice people watching.  Service was wonderful and everyone was very friendly.  Plus if you're a Total Rewards member then you get a discount on most menu items :)  Coffee was great (always a good sign) since we love coffee and there's nothing more disappointing than bad coffee to start the day... Food came out pretty quickly and everything was delicious.  I guess we had low expectations from reading reviews AFTER we were seated but we were all pleased with our dishes.  So no idea what people were eating and when but our brunch was great!!
