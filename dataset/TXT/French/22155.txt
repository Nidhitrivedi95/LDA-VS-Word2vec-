BSmqxPbQglQwP2R56OqOag Been here for a month, and have dined out 6-8 times.  Best dinner yet. 
Service was good.  Wine list is ample and not a wallet-shredder on price.  Stuff across the board and a decent captain's list.  

Carpaccio and burrata appetizers were good.  Beware, the burrata is served with a hot chili sauce.  My wife ordered it and I had not read the description on the menu, so the heat caught me by surprise.  Having said that, it was very good. 

Entrees.  I had the  . . .

Ever.  
And it was very tasty.  Wife had the bolognese -- solid but not spectacular.  This is really only about a 4.5 star review, and the bolognese is probably what dropped it a bit, but to be candid, compared to our other dining experiences up here in North Scottsdale, this is 5 stars by comparison all day. 

Sorry -- no room for dessert.  Perhaps it was the loaf of yummy bread that they brought us out with our waters that filled me up. 

We have found our favorite place in North Scottsdale.  At least until we find our new favorite place.
