in3zjiaLpNzr9G3K35gAJQ Had dinner here on Mar 28, 2015 and it was absolutely amazing.  The food, as all the reviews here have said, is wonderful, and our waiter Elijah was attentive and efficient, as well as helping to make our evening a lot of fun with his outgoing, positive personality and his showmanship while serving.

Between my wife and me, we had the lobster quiche and the mixed seafood skewer, and both were excellent. Before this meal, I had evidently never eaten a real quiche, as the lobster quiche was above and beyond what I had previously thought of as quiche.  It's that good.  We also split a margherita pizza for an appetizer, which was good but not something I would say is a must-have.

Contrary to what Dick G. mentioned about parking in his review, we self-parked in the lot behind the restaurant, and there were no fees.  Perhaps he went the valet route?
