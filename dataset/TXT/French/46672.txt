nkHaix6KenApS8M-liZsCQ We went to Christopher's with the Deal Chicken 3-course dinner.  The food was very good and the service was just as good.  The lobster bisque was a bit too thin for my taste and is something I would pass on in the future. The lamb was delicious and the tuna salad was tasty as well.  We opted to order dessert and the mousse tower was delicious.  We were saddened that they did not have the grand marnier souffle on the night we went, which was highly recommended.  Will return!
