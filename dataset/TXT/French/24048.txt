cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg Debating between 3.5 and 4 stars, but this was a fun dinner - we sat in front of one of the chefs and watched him put all sorts of things into the oven (including two pig heads, which was interesting). We started with the onion soup, which was okay - I think it tasted too much like smoky bacon, which I didn't care for. We also had an incredible mushroom and cheese tartlet with a perfectly dressed side of greens. 

For the main course, we got the happy pork chop (which was served with a ridiculously yummy mushroom sauce) and foie gras on top of a buckwheat crepe with potatoes and cheese and maple syrup...and to top it off, it had some of the. best. bacon. i have EVER had in my entire life. yum. We had a mistake with the order, so when we finally got the steak frites we were slightly disappointed - the steak was undercooked and the cut of meat wasn't the greatest - it also had the same mushroom sauce, so it would have been nice to know that in advance. The french fries were perfectly cooked though. 

For dessert we had pudding chomeur - a biscuit surrounded by cream and hot maple syrup. Once you start eating it, it crumbles into a wonderful pudding like texture. It was phenomenal.
