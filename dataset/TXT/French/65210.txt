u-SvRRAfYgpbXZRfQgcTzA SAKE BOMB!

Imadake is good food, fun especially with friends. 

Hung out there for the first time with a bunch of friend and well came away with the same experience. 

The food was fresh and well priced. 

The drinks were yummy and the on tap Sapporo was super refreshing. 

Next time I go I'm trying the ramen it looked awesome as it passed me by. 

Overall Imadake was full of life and good japanese eats. 

Can't wait to go again! 

Pro Tip: If you are there with a group of friend get a round of sake shots . Shake bombs to be specific... you will be pleased!
