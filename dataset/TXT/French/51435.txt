P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ This restaurant is good  but not great, the food was stander but not outstanding, I had artichoke  soup it was wonderful but my main dish lobster was not properly cooked, the service need improvement for the price they charge.  they need to train the wait staffs like a two Michelin restaurant!
I've been to Joel Robuchon and Twist, their wait staffs are much more pro than Guy Savoy!
