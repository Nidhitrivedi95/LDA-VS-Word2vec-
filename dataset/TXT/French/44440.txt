ME6D5nLlfG0xZCtICOYDuw Started with the beignets. Have eaten them at the cafe DuMonde in New Orleans-these were just as good! My husband had the quiche of the day-AWESOME! My daughter had the French toast from the kids menu-almost finished it. For her little 7 yr old stomach- THATS A COMPLIMENT!! I had the eggs Benedict-some of the BEST I've had!! We sat outside in the beautiful fall air. LOVED the atmosphere! But the most outstanding thing that made our visit here so wonderful was our awesome waiter PHIL LOERA.  He made our first time visit here out of this world. Based on our waiter, our food, and the awesome atmosphere, we will DEFINITELY be back!!!! Would drive the 3 hours it takes to get here for us!
