My husband and I came here for our anniversary and both had the elegance menu. 

My first course was the tuna tartare with a shaved fennel slaw. Sure, it's not the most creative dish, but it was very, very, tasty. The fennel with the ponzu sauce complimented the tartare cleanly and wonderfully. I thoroughly enjoyed this dish.

The second dish was the chorizo wrapped sea bass. All I can say is, oh. my. gawd. I could have had 12 servings of this dish and not be tired of it. This dish was ridiculously good and it is one of THE best dishes I have EVER had, and that's saying a lot. 

The third dish was the filet mignon. The filet melted like butter on the tongue. This dish was extremely well executed but not nearly as creative as the second course. 

For dessert, we had the chocolate cake with popcorn ice cream (which was awesome) and a peanut butter shake, which I did not like so much. The peanut butter shake was way too overpowering and peanut-buttery, it didn't fit in with the rest of the dessert. 

The chef brought out a complementary passion fruit chocolate cake with the words, "happy anniversary" on it. That was so sweet and such a nice touch. This dessert actually was my favorite one. The passion fruit gave an acidity and fruitiness that balanced out the dark chocolate perfectly. 

This place is very, very expensive (our meal was over $300), but completely worth it. I thoroughly enjoyed my meal and would definitely come back for another special occasion.
