0JGMKaKJGVuDus5WcJzvjw Came with high expectations and was underwhelmed.  I ordered the foie gras de cochon for appetizer and it was very rich and buttery, pretty good but couldn't finish the 3 pieces it came with.  The green salad was pretty good with cauliflower, lettuce.  I tried the Liverpool steak medium rare and it was pretty good but not impressed.  I thought it didn't have much salt or seasoning at all.  The spinach was pretty good and pickle was an odd side dish.  I also tried the half order of lobster spaghetti which was more than enough.  The lobster was good and I really liked the spaghetti in a rich creamy buttery sauce but half size was enough for me.  Service was pretty nonexistent and waitress didn't really explain the menu which was written in chalkboard in French in the corner and forgot our drinks.  It also took forever to get our food.  For the price, I expected better.
