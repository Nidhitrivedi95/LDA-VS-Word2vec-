Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA Beautiful restaurant and amazing view of the strip from the lounge.  The restaurant portion has a entire cascade of glass bubbles that curtain around the center dining area.  The lounge area is almost decorated in a sea scape, but the view reminds me of being up at ghost bar at the palms.  The food was not quite as spectacular as the view and decor, but the best dishes were the Gnocchi and the scallops.  For the drinks at the lounge, be prepared to watch the bartender and tell him to add either more alcohol or mixers, they seem to like to go on the extreme heavy end or light end.
