xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g Invited to join old friends for a birthday dinner.  The setting and view from the restaurant were excellent and got better once the sun set over the mountains.  Food was terrific and the service top rate!  All capped when dessert was served; souffles were great, but the champagne passion fruit merengue dish was SUPERB!!  A definite "recommend" for those who enjoy great food, ambiance and service...We will return!
