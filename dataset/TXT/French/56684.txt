rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A This is not the same bouchon as the Bouchon in Napa. I mean the service is horrible, the food is greasy. It took them 40 mins to cook our food, the waiter came to fill our water once. I have an orange juice coming with my order. At one point the waiter said he would get me my orange juice but I never had my orange juice. We asked for the check and the waiter kept walking around without giving us the check. Most importantly, the food is pretty bad. I took a few bites and just can't handle it anymore.
