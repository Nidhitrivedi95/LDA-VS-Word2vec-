pmoIMK8zGWvKsVOPDBYfzg Andre's was excellent and the staff was wonderful. I enjoyed the spinach salad with duck confit as my appetizer and it was just a bit warmed over and completely delicious. For dinner I went for the lobster thermidor.....ridiculously well seasoned. The lobster and mushrooms melted in my mouth and adding asparagus was a ideal choice. Everything went well with the hollandaise-esque sauce it was smothered in. We ordered our dessert, souffles, at the same time as our appetizers. Glad I did, as I was stuffed at the end and may have passed, but I ended up trying three of them. Kahlua, Grand Marnier, and a yummy Roasted Peanut. Pricey, so be ready to pay at least $100/head without drinks or wine. You can bring your own nice bottle of wine, but know there is a $50 corking fee per bottle.
