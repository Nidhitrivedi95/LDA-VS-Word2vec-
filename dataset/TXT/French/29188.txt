eQ4Oj_kjrjVV0CfDcDWBmg Note to other restaurants: Bow down to Batifole, motherpuckers.

I went back recently and wow. Batifole does so many things right from their execution of food, to service, to extremely reasonable pricing. They've added bouillabaisse to the menu, and with one sip I was transported back to the South of France. The heady broth is scented with plenty of fennel, and the fish and mussels were cooked perfectly. 

Do you know how much work goes into this seafood soup? I will probably never attempt to make this at home so I'm happy to shell out the $18 they charge for this dish. At this price, it's an absolute bargain.

I tried my dining companion's baked filet of smooth-dory topped with zucchini ($18) and it made me think that every restaurant should send their cooks to have mandatory fish training with the Batifole chef. The dish is perfumed with aromatic herbs and the fish just melts in your mouth. 

Batifole is a small, unassuming restaurant but it somehow delivers food that tastes like a team of French cooks in chef whites and funny hats have been slaving over it all day.

Unfortunately, my starter of chicken liver brulé was less successful. It was boozy and the candied brulé topping was too sweet for the dish. I prefer the elegance of the chicken liver parfait at Biff's.

The frites were stellar and have become my gold standard for spuds in this city.

They have cute signs in the restaurant that say Batifole is "The best restaurant in Chinatown" but after my visits, I think they could broaden the parameters of that claim.

(No credit cards, but debit is accepted which is one way they keep their prices low.)
