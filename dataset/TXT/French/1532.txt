0B_aEPeZjrXs6T7vS3arrA Thank you to Sophie's for providing a wonderful meal for our family. It was our first experience there and we were not disappointed. We thought that we would have trouble finding a children's meal for our ten year old but they accomodated us by cooking her thin strips of steak. We added that with french fries and she was set. We had the abundant cheese plate, the salmon fish special (amazing), and delicious spinach. We could not handle dessert but the crepes looked marvelous. Cute and charming, a great place for a first date.
