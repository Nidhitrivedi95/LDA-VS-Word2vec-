ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug Expensive ($80 breakfast for 2 adults and 2 small children), pretty low quality (I ordered eggs over easy and they were over hard), small portions (3 egg omelette was 2 eggs at best, french toast came with one piece of bread cut in half) and very very slow service. Nice atmosphere in a neat place but otherwise abyssmal
