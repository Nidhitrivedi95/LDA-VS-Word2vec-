The new tattoo-covered 'help' behind the counter will not come forward to assist customers now. The owner, Duc, is a lovely man. I am not sure why he has allowed the service to slide. The initial ambiance he created of a gracious french bakery has now been replaced by a palpable tension of customers trying to get service and a completely disorganized and unfriendly waitstaff.
