9u5XZ2KZHTrl0EZTRSJrqA Fantastic food, superb service. 
I'm a brunch connaisseur. Been around multiple spots in and around Montreal, this place just made it in my top 3.

We were 10 ppl + 2 kids,  came in unanounced on a Sunday at noon. Owner was very accommodating and went above and beyond to get us seated fast. The amount of dishes in the menu is impressive. We all got our plates at the same time, kitchen staff is very organized. Our whole group was veey pleased. I will definitely be back. BEST FRENCH TOAST IVE EVER HAD, you must try it!
