O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q After a long day, my vendor and I met up for dinner.  I asked him, what do you want to eat, he says he wants a piece of steak.  At first I said no but then I was like, I do want steak.  We scoured opentable and voila, Morels it was.

We ordered the caesar salad which was made table side.  It is a caesar salad, nothing special although I thought it had too much acidity and I wouldn't have minded some anchovies.  Before the salad came I was famished but the bread was nowhere to be seen.  I'm not sure why we had to ask them to bring the bread but we did however it was warm and soft and the butter and olive tapenade that came with it were a perfect combination.

I did order a steak, a bone in rib eye but I had so much bread I couldn't finish it all.  The steak though wasn't all that great.  It was well cooked; I asked for medium rare and I got medium rare but the seasoning that was on it wasn't flavorful enough and the flavor it did have wasn't all that good.

We also ordered the pomme frites which are thin cut fries and those I do not like even though the truffle mayo it came with was delicious and a good sauce for the steak.  

Service was good and attentive.  I would probably want to try other steak houses next time I'm here.
