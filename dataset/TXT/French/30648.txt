fVF5wayDyY6ZR5oJB1IK3g My partner and I popped into Lawrence for lunch when we arrived in Montreal, having heard of the restaurant from food blogs. We did not have a reservation, but were able to get a table in about 20 minutes. (In the meantime, you can walk around the Mile End area while you wait for your table, and there is an amazing boulangerie named Guillaume where we bought amazing bread.)

After reading the blogs, this place did not disappoint. It has a very adventurous vibe to some of the food, though the menu is not very large. It's heavy on odd foods, such as lumpfish caviar, pig's head, pickled herring. 

Literally everyone seemed to be getting the cheeseburger, so I just had to join the bandwagon order one as well. It was delicious, though the potato wedge fries look better than they tasted. The beef tartare was also delicious, though I have had better. My partner opted for one of the specials, a pasta that was pretty good.

Overall, we enjoyed Lawrence.  It was very quaint, and was packed with locals, which is always a good sign.
