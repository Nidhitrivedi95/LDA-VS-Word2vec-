This place just gets me, which is evident as soon as you start walking down the center of the restaurant to locate the main seating area, only to be greeted by an open kitchen to your right where everything from frying pans to ancient washing boards to the giant vents are decorations, and a self-titled Wall of Booze to your left that apparently boasts over 150 different types of alcohol to drown your sad adult sorrows in. But I couldn't tell you about that. 
(There are flies, but I like to think they make the restaurant look alive.)
If you look up, the ceiling is metal, with several lights hanging down - the seating area, to contrast, has a skylight. The tables are covered in colorful cloths, and you'll spot two or three chairs that don't match the red of the others, and that's perfectly fine. The walls are covered in paintings and drawings and other cool things - generally, this place is just very old-timey, and it instantly grabs you with its charm.
As for food: Fromage Fondant, Foie Gras, Carrot Cake. It all shares a general theme of exuding this earthly, smoky feel to it, which I find hard to describe - in general, strong flavors that remind you of meat grilled over a charcoal fire (but without actually being meat grilled over a charcoal fire). Nuts, like pecans, are common. Sour and sweet where it doesn't feel necessary also is. It's a nice variety, and each dish tastes and looks distinctly different, but they all feel like they belong together. 
Man, what a nice atmosphere. 
I love it.
