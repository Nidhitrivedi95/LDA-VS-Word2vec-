wf6cEXlL1qkNGH0-_CjKMw Yes, the restaurant is rather small. Yes, there is only one waiter to serve you. Yes, sometimes orders get mixed up before finding their table. But you know what? It`s okay. Everything will work itself out.

Even coming during one of their busiest times of the year (the dreaded 'Licious time for most restaurants), the food is great, and the service, while harried, is honest. 
The restaurant is small, so even with a reservation, be prepared to wait 5 - 10 minutes for your table during busy times. 

Leave time to find parking. While there is street parking right in front, and another small group of spots on the side street nearby, there are quite a few restaurants in the area, as well as a group of office buildings across the street. In a pinch, there is a Green P lot further east on Bloor.
