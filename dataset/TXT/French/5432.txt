Montreal has its awesome local food, but once in a while you have to look beyond and have the cuisine which resembles this province: French food. It's awesome, comforting, and most of all it's not greasy at all.

I chose Les Deux Gamins due to its excellent reviews and close proximity to the Metro. Even the walk to the restaurant was quite nice, as you pass thru a park and some Victorian-style houses.

Upon entering the restaurant, you can immediately tell that it's an authentic French restaurant with the traditional French setup. The tables are small, the seats are also smaller, and the restaurant has several floors. You are served by a male waiter, and the person pouring water is a female dressed in traditional French attire.

The menu isn't extensive, but it covers many of the French staples. I went with the French Onion Soup, escargots, butcher cut (short rib), and creme brulee du jour. Before everything came, we were served with homemade French bread, which was not surprisingly on the hard side, but it tasted quite good for what it's worth.

The French Onion Soup was delicious and had that excellent onion aroma. The cheese was also plentiful and melted well with the soup, and the croutons also mashed well with the soup. The escargots were plentiful, and the garlic add-on was a nice touch. The butcher cut, which we shared, was grilled medium rare, which in this case was excellent. However, I would say that I had better beef in other restaurants before, and unless it's a part that's unique it's not something would order again. Finally, the creme brulee had an excellent cream texture, and is something I would definitely order again for dessert.

Service was excellent, and we were attended to the whole way by both the waiter and the lady. I was definitely pleased with my visit, and would surely come back whenever I'm in Montreal.
