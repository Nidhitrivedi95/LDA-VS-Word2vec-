rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w Had dinner here with a group from work while we were at the Bellagio for a tradeshow. I didn't realize what an expensive restaurant this was when I suggested it for our group. When we sat down and I saw that the menu had no prices I got a little bit nervous. Glad I wasn't paying...

The food was amazing and the service was great as well. The restaurant was pretty quiet which was nice for our group and allowed us to chat with our customers over dinner. If money is no object, you should check this place out next time you're at the Bellagio!
