The food is simple and lovely.  I love the understated vibe of both the food and the decor.  

The crusty bread they service was fresh and warm.  We ordered the mussels as an appetizer upon the suggestion of the spunky brit gal who hosts and serves.  The sauce was a perfect complement to the bread, and the mussels were very fresh as promised by our server.

The pasta was al-dente and not overly sauced (something I hate about most North American Italian restaurants).  Those who ordered veal at the table were also very pleased with their selection.

Of course, I couldn't leave without getting dessert, in this case Tartufo, which was a nice end to the meal.

Make sure you call ahead to make reservations - it can be difficult to get a seat sometimes.
