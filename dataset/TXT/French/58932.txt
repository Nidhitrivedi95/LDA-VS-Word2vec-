rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w This is such a bummer for me to write because I've had a great meal at Le Cirque before but last night was truly terrible. We had a reservation for 6 people, all doing the tasting menu at 8pm. The dining room was half empty. Brett Michaels (yes, that Brett Michaels...) and some ladies walked in and clearly took our table despite not having a reservation. Fine. That sort of thing happens. But then the hostess left us at the bar for 45 minutes past our reservation time- no apology, no acknowledgment that this was incredibly rude and inconsiderate. She would only say that there was nothing she could do when we asked when we would be seated. The entire time we were sitting there looking at empty tables. We wound up making a reservation at Michael Mina from the bar and going there. Absolutely jaw dropping from this sort of restaurant.
