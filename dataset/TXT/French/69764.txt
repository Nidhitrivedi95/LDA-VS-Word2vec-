WOd8tWsh2Yt_osHv-ngx_w Not gonna lie to you, food is pretty good - on par for what you'd expect from a typical breakfast restaurant. However if you are a religious brunch-eater, don't even bother. The long line and pretty patio are enough to draw you in, but the service was mediocre AT BEST. Don't expect your table or menus to be clean, and you can forget substituting or altering your order in any way - seeing as they will blatantly ignore your request. As if finding a bee carcus in my coffee wasn't enough to make sure this was a one time visit, the waitor actually requested that my friend tip higher ... Holding us all up and leaving me feeling as bitter as the unripe melons i was given as a poor excuse for fruit. 4/10 wouldn't recommend.
