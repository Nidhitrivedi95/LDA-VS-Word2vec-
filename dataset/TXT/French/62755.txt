SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ I went here for lunch - I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich with fig, arugula, and goat cheese with ciabatta bread.  The bread was kinda tough and the chicken was dry.  

For dessert, I had the bread pudding and it was really really dry - all bread, no pudding, and lots of whip cream.  Yuck.  I had two or three bites and I was done with my meal.

I have never been here for dinner, but based on my lunch experience, I am not sure if I want to come back for dinner.
