UxWH8zRYIBgs6Q2oykvRdw I was in awe when I walked in - the ambiance and decor is classy and elegant with a bar made of marble and fancy mirrors all over the walls. We didn't make reservations for dinner on a weekend, and the place was packed, but we were able to take the last table in the bar!

We ordered the meatballs, french onion soup, and poutine - all were really good. For it being so busy, the service we got was great as well.

I will definitely be back here!
