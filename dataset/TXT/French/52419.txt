q0n4I-zqiI47xispOqc1lA Honestly I have no idea what has taken me so long to patron this great little bistro; especially since it's within walking distance from my house. But hey, better late than never. We were the first customers for brekkie on Sunday and the wait for our food was a little longer than most places. However, that wasn't an issue because our meals were clearly prepared with a pride and passion for food. We started with a cheese plate that came with a crepe and marmalade and that could have been a shared meal itself. For main courses I had the pesto crepe with side salad and my boyfriend had the Polish Hill crepe with a side salad. You guessed it, his was similar to eating a pierogi with cheese, mashed potatoes and caramelized onions. I had s bite and it just melted in my mouth. And for me how can you go wrong with a pesto crepe? It literally tasted straight from the garden with fresh mozzarella, cherry tomatoes and the most fragrant basil. Service was very good and the interior is quaint, inviting and comfortable. They've even got a back dining patio. Everything about this place reminded me of Europe without trying too hard. It's a theme that flows organically throughout. Also want to mention that the menu has so many choices without being overwhelming or too much to take in.
