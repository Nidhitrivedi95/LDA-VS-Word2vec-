58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw Had brunch there.  Even though I've read mixed reviews about this place, my dining experience there was decent.  The waiter was nice and friendly.

I had cafe au lait avec lait de soya (pretty much a soy latte as it was made with expresso instead of coffee), and it came in a big soup bowl, interesting!  I got the brunch sucré (crepe with french toast).  It came with freshly squeezed orange juice, and that was just awesome!  I love the OJ.  They gave us an 'amusee-bouche,' which was like a bread pudding (and much larger than an one-biter!).  It was a bit cold but very tasty (cinnamon!!!).  My main course came with yogurt with granola and blueberries (decent), french toast with apple butter/blueberries.  The apple butter was good.  The french toast was a little disappointing though (a little stale perhaps?).  And it came with the 2 crepes with raspberry sauce and orange zest.  The crepes were disappointing.  The texture was a little rubbery.  Definitely not my favorite there.

My friend got the Brunch Cartet (ham/cheese sandwich), and she said that was delicious.  My other friend got the Brunch L'Atlantique (salmon bagel, salmon with eggs, and salmon cake), and I totally prefer that over my sucré brunch!

Aside from the brunch sucré, the food, the service, and the decor of Le Cartet was pretty good!
