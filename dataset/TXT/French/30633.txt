fVF5wayDyY6ZR5oJB1IK3g Waiting is the hardest part,  but Lawrence is worth every second spent. Weekend brunch is generally crowded with typical wait times of 30 minutes to an hour, but the brunch warrants the queue. 

While Lawrence serves the normal brunch fare, you'll also find some unexpected dishes like kedgeree, pigs feet or blood sausage - all of it prepared exquisitely.

Highly recommended.
