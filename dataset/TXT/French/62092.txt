SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ Have been here 3 times now I think.  Once for a full meal a year or two ago, drinks a couple weeks back, and a few days back for apps and drinks.  This last time was good.  The wines by the glass are good and the app selection had decent variety.  The short rib app is really good and has a nice kick.  The shrimp/fish cake was dry and marginal so he took it off the bill.  The atmosphere is nice because you can sit outside at the bar, misters, fairly quiet, cool place.  We were there somewhat late and so it seemed that all of the employees were drinking and smoking at the bar.  That was a little annoying.  I get that they are off and want a drink, that's cool.  However, it's a business so the customers should have the run of the place.  Either way, I would recommend it.
