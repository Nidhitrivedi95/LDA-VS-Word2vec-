We made sure to arrive around 530 to be one of the first people in line as the wait times between 6 and 10 look like they could be an hour or more since it's a relatively small restaurant. It looks like the staff really cares about their craft and the food reflects all of the love and care from this family run business. A must go to place in Montreal
