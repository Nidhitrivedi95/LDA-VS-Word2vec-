3jKUbhGSjFTv5jZ0wnW0xA Le Deux Gamins was everything as advertised on yelp and much much more! My wife and I went for our 1 year wedding anniversary.  The place is very cozy but not noisy or cramped. The service was attentive but not intrusive and the food was AMAZING!!! If you are looking for a great French meal but not too expensive you MUST GO TO LE DEUX GAMINS!! The escargot was delicious and tnder. The flank steak was well marinated and not over cooked. The duck confit was savory and full of rich flavor. Plus the portions were perfect and not overwhelming. The molten chocolate cake was decadent and the perfect end to an perfect meal. We definitely will come back here when we visit Montreal again!
