rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Their advertsing claims they have the best breakfast in Vegas.  I wasn't too impressed.  It could be the fact that my gf ordered take out for us since I was too hung over from the night before :)  The breakfast paltter I had tasted pretty standard.  Neither good nor bad.  I'll have to try dinner here on my next trip.
