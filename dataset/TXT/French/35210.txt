Ht-_i0UAq7YDBaqJwcQMdQ Not impressed...my reservation at the restaurant was based solely on the strong reviews from my fellow Yelpers. First the good....the service was impeccable, the waiters were very knowledgeable and professional. We had the foie gras for our app which was pretty amazing, but the meal went down from there. The surf and turf ($45) was mediocre at best, the lobster lacked taste and the filet was was nothing to write home about either. The hot and solid meal ($65) also failed to live up to, or even generate any hype. Perhaps it was my error in getting two predominantly beef entrees, but I could have gotten the same at the Outback. After hearing about all of the progress that Montreal has made in terms of it's restaurants, this first meal was a true disappointment. I do hope that the chef can step it up as his staff is just too good to be associated with such mediocrity.
