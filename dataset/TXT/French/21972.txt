bRmb81XDG3E2SOHARBLTog I was here for Valentine's day and the place was packed.  My boyfriend made a reservation at 8pm and there were still people coming in as we were leaving.  The restaurant was really nice, the decorate was beautiful.  The place was definitely fit for a romantic dinner.
Besides the decor, the food was delicious too.  We started with the escargot appetizer which was really (I have never had it before).  For entree, we got the lamb and the eggplant with feta cheese tower.  The lamb was cooked to perfection and the eggplant and cheese was amazing too.

Overall, I would definitely come back for a special night out.  Recommended.
