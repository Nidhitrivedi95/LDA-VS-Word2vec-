mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q Las Vegas has snagged the biggest and brightest in everything, especially fine dining.  I write these reviews on the excellent restaurants I visited as I sit at McCarran (my flight's delayed), and I believe this stellar week started with L'Atelier for my birthday.

First the decor.  It's a small space with possibly 4 tables and an open space kitchen lined with counter seats.  The back bar is honestly a waste of space, but the tiny yet elegant surroundings give lend to a great friendly feel (I spent some time chatting with my dining neighbors on wine & Vegas restaurants).  Sit for the counter service, and see your food being made.

Ooh la la.  Elegance in small portions that blow the taste buds away.  I've never have mashed potatoes (pommes puree) like this, nor have I had canard foie gras any better.  We went the small plates route, and along with those two mentioned, had the kusshi oysters, tuna belly with onion rings, and the beef and foie gras burgers with carmelized onions.  Each small plate seemed to flow perfectly with the other, and dessert continued in that fashion as the Le Framboise certainly provided that the surprise wasn't the only thing you'd remember about it.

Fine dining at its pinnacle, I have enjoyed the creations of Robuchon and plan to continue doing so.
