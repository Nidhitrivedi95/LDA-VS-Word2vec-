I remember a time when the his restaurant used to be really good with fall-off-the-bone ribs and perfectly cooked chicken tenders. Now, the ribs are tough and dry, plus the chicken tenders are burnt. 

It doesn't surprise me though, the restaurant has a prime tourist location so they can serve whatever they want and people will come. Not the locals though, they'll stay away like me from now on.

Edit: I've contacted them at the below address a while back and they never got back to me. They probably don't care.
