1_3nOM7s9WqnJWTNu2-i8Q I'm surprised to see so many negative reviews for this restaurant.  I have to admit that I live and work in the area, so I tend to stay away from it during prime tourist/jazz festival season since I can enjoy the restaurant at any time of the year.  While I can't comment on their food or service when they're running at full tilt, I would say it's not to be missed in the fall, winter, or even spring.  My experience has always been excellent and although the menu isn't inexpensive, I don't find that it's overly expensive for the quality of food and service that you receive.  Add the fact that it's a non profit and all the proceeds go to funding our amazing Jazz Festival every year, and it's a no brainer choice for a lovely meal in the Quartier des Spectacles.
