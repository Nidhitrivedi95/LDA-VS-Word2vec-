4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I love this place. i really do. the food is pretty good, but this time just sucked....... Checked in, was told it was 15-30 minutes for an outside patio table. Weather was perfect, so we decided to wait. 45 minutes later (with my buzzer in hand) i was told my reservation was lost and i'd have the next available table.
Strolling through the restaurant, passing a table for 2 at the outside rail, we were seated at a table for 4 right next to the goddamn server station. 
For an hour i was continuously bumped and kicked by servers sitting here and the ONLY reason i didn't blow up, is because this was my wifes birthday weekend and she specifically wanted to go here. 
$150 for lunch, including cocktails......
