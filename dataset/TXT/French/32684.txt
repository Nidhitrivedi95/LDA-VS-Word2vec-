gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg Came here again...improved quite a bit. Maybe it was just the server we had the last time I was here, but this time they were quick an attentive. Food was spot on, and also the drinks came out quickly. It still isn't an "amazing" place, but it is good pub food with a German twist to it.
