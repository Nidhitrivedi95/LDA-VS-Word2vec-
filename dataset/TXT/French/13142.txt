4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw As we were walking along the Strip, we spotted this cute place with an outdoor patio and we all made a mental note to try this place for brunch/lunch the next day.

When we arrived, we were promptly given a seat indoors, but close to the outside patio since all the outside seating was taken...which ended up okay since people were smoking. The area we sat in was large, airy and definitely full of light...a total opposite from the front of the restaurant that was pretty dark.

Here's what we ordered:
-hand cut Gaufrette potato chips ($5.95): the best darn home made chips I've had! Light, not greasy and delicious with the blue cheese dipping sauce
-open-face shrimp salad ($11.95): my friend enjoyed it, looked really fresh
-combo maison: grilled cheese and short rib sandwich, cup of Gazpacho and Frites ($12.95): great deal! The grilled cheese and short rib sandwich was okay...a bit greasy and the meat was dry but the cup of gazpacho was GREAT! Nice and cool, perfect on a hot day...I wish I had a whole bowl of it! Large cup of fries that were done perfectly. I wish I had room to eat more!
-classic quiche Lorraine ($11.95): my friend said it was dry and cooked too long

If you're tired of the buffets and want a nice sit down place to enjoy your food, I'd definitely come here!
