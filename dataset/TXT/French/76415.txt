Yp9w4nhUowBU_IS_StFXbQ To determine how long it has been since I have enjoyed Tableau, the meal I was here for was dinner. Regretting the length of time that has spanned since this last visit, I notice they now only serve breakfast/lunch/brunch.

The hosts had made reservations here and even though this was not my original choice, I was looking forward to Tableau, as this was my first dining experience at The Wynn. At the time, this was one of the most elegant properties on the strip (and to this day, still is). I certainly felt somewhat out of place, but the service and company was exceptional, and didn't make me feel like the serf* that I normally am. 

A stunning dining room greets you as you walk in; the lighting was dim but not so much where you can't see the menu, the decor appeared to be in warm creams, with lively bursts of color on the seating throughout. We had a table inside, but the outside had a lovely view overlooking the pool. 

This was my first time trying beef carpaccio; as this was one of those 'try anything' dining excursions I'll probably never have again, and I don't think I'll find a similar dish in quality anywhere else. Forgive me for forgetting the remainder of what I had that night, but this appetizer still stands out today. 

I wondered what those adorable miniature 'chairs' were next to our own, and while the male host said it was a place where one could rest their legs after a long meal, the other host-a female-explained to me it's where a lady puts her purse. My clutch looked minute settled onto this, but it served its job well.

Based on the little I recall from dinner so long ago, I imagine Tableau really knows how to do an amazing brunch. Even with all the newer, high-caliber, celebrity-endorsed establishments that have popped up on the strip, I plan on making this a stop when I come back to town.

*I most likely returned to this state once I exited the doors of The Wynn.
