4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I still can't pronounce the name of this place.
Located in Paris hotel casino, this place is right near the entrance facing Las Vegas blvd.
A friend decided on this place because of the yelp ratings.
We came in with about 15-20 people around 4:30PM on a hot Saturday afternoon in the middle of July.
We were seated right away, service was great!
Glass was never empty and the servers were always around.
However, the food took a while, but this was a big group.

The fresh baguette was delicious!! Comes out hot and fresh =) yummm unlimited and free! Goes great with the butter and carrot thing.

Had a glass of sangria which was refreshing and yummy =) my friend bought a pitcher and the waiter was nice enough to offer to put more ice in it.

The menu had quite a few variety: seafood, steak, salad, and hamburgers. Price was decent for a nice restaurant. I would say everything was about $10-$30 a plate.
The oysters ($15) was so delicious! Very fresh and they had a great vinegar sauce to go along with the horseradish. Yummy!!

I ordered the prime medium well hamburger ($13) with grilled cheese, which came with a side of their frites. Hamburger was good. I loved the little pickles that came with it. The frite was yummy too, thin crispy french fries.

I had a bite of the scallops and it was amazing!! I loved it!

Overall I enjoyed our early dinner. I was super stuffed! I would come back again for the oysters and scallops!
