SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA My go to recomendation for anyone looking for a classy, French inspired restaurant. I say inspired because they have dishes that transcend the typical French classics. Not that there is anything wrong with classics! I can honestly say after 4 times here I was never left wanting for the quality of the service, food, and ambiance. The perfect spot after a classy evening say, enjoying the Orcherestra at Severance. If you are unfamiliar with French, come here, engage your server, let them do what they do best and guarantee you will be happy. If you have kids, you will enjoy it much more if you spring for a sitter. This is a place best allowed to pace leisurely from course to course, and the tables can be close together.
