LQ_gYNs5E10IGFE0NOyD7A Couldn't be a better place for a date or dinner with a group of friends in old town scottsdale. It is nicely secluded giving you a very private feel. The patio is nicely decorated and the lighting and set up gives you a warm relaxing vibe. 

  The hostess was very friendly and welcomed us in with a great smile and open arms. One of the most impressive things about the restaurant is the quality of service you will receive. I have been to the Upton twice and in both occasions the servers gave superior service. They described each dish to a science and accommodated our taste buds to what we were looking for as well. We were also greeted personally by the owner Bran. He once again showed what superior service in a restaurant is by checking on us and making sure everything was up to par. He also gave a brief history of the facility making us feel at home and asked for any feedback we had for him.  

The menu is on the smaller side and the dishes are tapas style all with a  creative spin making it a very unique concept. I have tried numerous items all in which were full of flavor and just the right portion size.   I personally love a bunch of dishes here. For appetizers the crispy confit duck wings fall right off the bone, and the broth in the mediterranean mussels give them a rich savory flavor. The angus bistro steak was cooked just right and the onions on the side give the two an amazing flavor. The seared wild salmon as well was extremely light and when dipped in lemon greek yogurt give a the salmon a very good spin.  

Their drink menu is also of high caliper as their drinks are made with higher quality liquors. The Refresher is just that as the combination of cucumber, mint & lime give it a cooling sensation as you drink it. 

I would highly recommend the Upton for anyone in old town scottsdale as it is nothing but excellence! Thank you Bran and the Upton Team!
