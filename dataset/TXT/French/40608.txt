KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA I love this place! This is where I have celebrated Mothers Day for the past 5 years. This occasion was my birthday and we were a party of five couples. The food was excellent, the company extraordinary, and venue was perfection. We requested the patio with its gorgeous water views, and were seated in front of a fireplace and backed up by a heater-it was perfect. The manager stopped by often to assure we were well-served. My duck breast was 2nd to none, and our waitress was nonpareil. She was so capable and intuitive.
