zw4Legbcu018p5WcZ74iWA Very cute place, super friendly and full of character, a good intro to Montreal for us as this was our first stop after our hostel. We were lucky enough to get seats in the afternoon by the window to enjoy our classic poutine (our first time!), look out at the streets & the park and take it all in. Ultimately wasn't too fond of the poutine (probably just because I like my fries crisp and not saucy).
