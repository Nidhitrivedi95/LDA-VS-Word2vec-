4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw There's not many other spots on the strip that could rival this place for people watching over a yummy breakfast!  The fact that the spot is so great does make Mon Ami VERY busy especially on a weekend (be prepared for an hour long wait at least) and, frustratingly the buzzer they give you to alert you when your table is ready only works if you're in the immediate vicinity of the restaurant which rules out a wander around the shops to kill the time!  Once you're in the food is pretty good and the fresh bread they serve is a lovely addition.  My husband and I tried a few dishes on the menu including steak and eggs (which my husband raved about), goats cheese omelet (which was very tasty) and blueberry waffles (could have been better).  Overall I'd definitely recommend having breakfast or brunch here at least once during your trip but maybe avoid weekends!!
