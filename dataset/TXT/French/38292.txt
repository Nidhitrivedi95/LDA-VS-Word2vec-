JezHN-9KKLTMbojq00VP0g I love coming here with my mom or my friend Kirsten!  We have the best time when we go.  We feel like we are on vacation when we go.  It is just so different.  The food is awesome.  The croissants are amazing along with the Beouff Bourgonion (incredible).  The service is sometimes slow because they don't have many servers on.  But other than that I go probably once or twice a month....I love it here ( i already said that).  :) Enjoy!
