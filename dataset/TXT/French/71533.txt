The ambience and service were both great and there were a ton of attractive items on the menu.

Tried a few menu items:

Pâté (3.5 stars): This was fine; it ha a pretty light flavor and was dense.  It leaned a little much on the bologna side of the spectrum.

Gruyere Burger (4 stars): This burger was really good; thick patty, dense eggy homemade bun, and melted cheese with a hint of truffle.  The fries were okay as well.
