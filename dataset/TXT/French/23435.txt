c8j5MQqlb0RhgS_bpxMDuA great service... not so great food. I had the vegan plate, described as a vegan pate made from vegetables and nuts served with vegetables. The "pate"  ended up being a sort of vegan meatloaf. Very dry while the "vegetables" was grilled red bell pepper. I ate the entire plate and was still hungry. My mom had the rabbit, and said it was okay, but dry, while my dad had the salmon gravlax, which he simply couldn't eat. Their drinks also were pretty bad and very overpriced! However, our waitress was a total sweetheart.
