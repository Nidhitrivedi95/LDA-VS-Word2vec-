xcmmTXhuMx2fZF2Bt69F4w I came here for graduation weekend with the family.  My brother, who had lived in the area for school, said that this was the "go-to" for mussels and fries and a neighborhood staple.  It's a small intimate space with good food and friendly service, but expect long lines during peak hours as everyone and their mom seems to love this place.

After waiting nearly 90 minutes for a table, we finally sat down to eat.  Of course, I had to go for the mussels, and between my dad, myself, and my brother, we were able to try all three sauces.  I ordered tomato and fennel style, which was pretty good, although a bit too nondescript for my taste.  My dad's red curry was much better, especially with that added bit of heat to break up the briny seafood.  My brother, who opted for the classic white wine sauce, had my favorite; it was creamy, savory, and really complimented the shellfish well.  I also really liked the fries, crispy and salty enough to serve as a formidable side.  The flourless chocolate cake for dessert was also outstanding and is a must.

Despite the ridiculous wait and crowds, I really enjoyed Point Brugge.  The food was on point and the service and staff were good.  I would definitely come back if I was ever in town again, but maybe try for a less-crowded day of the week.
