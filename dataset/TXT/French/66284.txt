uP3H5bcsiTXM0k0xQhRndg What a hidden gem! I love Montreal and their boutique restaurants! We visited as a Sunday morning cure after Halloween! The music was pumping and lively! The waitress greeted us and explained the family restaurant that everything was homemade even the bread! There is only a handful of things to order, but we visited for a late breakfast. Had the egg and pulled pork sandwich. Shortly after ordering they brought us a nicely plated mini muffin and skewer of fresh grapes and orange. Our sandwich came out shortly after (very attentive service by the staff) the sandwich was huge! Very fresh ingredients! Meat was spiced very well and the eggs was cooked perfectly. It was satisfying and half was good for one person!  I wish I could find a place like this locally! What a great experience before heading back home! 10/10 must visit! Limited seating! But worth it! A must visit for their very filling meal and excellent service :)
