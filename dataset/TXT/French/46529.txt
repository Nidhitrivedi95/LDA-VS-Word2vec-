nKeGPmH5dYNVL5AyAItuKg Cute little place - my friend and I came to grab a drink while we waited for our reservation at another place.  The wine suggested was great!  Service was attentive and it was a neat little spot.  I'd love to come by for dinner sometime.

BUT, it smelled strongly of fish because the kitchen is right in the restaurant.  When I got home, I smelled a slight fishiness in my hair.  So whatever is cooking there is chance that you'll smell like it on the way out.

I hope to come back and taste dinner rather than smell like it.
