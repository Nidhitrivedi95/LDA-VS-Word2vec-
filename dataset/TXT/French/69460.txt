wfO1xdAeJMb_miGDU19W-w My sister and I would often have our girls night out at the original Carmon's and we were really glad to see the place re-opened as a French Bistro so we stopped for brunch one weekend morning.

The new branding (chicken) is cute, but everywhere and a tad overdone. (Put the money into the food instead of the printed paper hand towels in the bathrooms!) There's also too much furniture shoved in and everything is too matchy-matchy. I did like the butcher block tabletops with the chicken logo branded in though - now that was cute.

The food was okay but portions were tiny and expensive. (I had the biscuits and gravy - that equated to a single split biscuit and maybe an ounce and a half of very tasty sausage gravy. For $9.50) 

There were several filled tables, but also more empty ones. And we were still seated at a two top right next to the wait station - so the servers just kept sliding between us and the big chopping block that just seemed out of place. (Could you take your butt out of my biscuit please? Thanks! really.)

Also, the service wasn't great like the old Carmen's. Even though the place was clearly overstaffed, once our plates were dropped, we were never offered a refill on our coffees and that would have been nice.

So, the old Carmon's got a 4.5 stars from me, and the new one rates 3 stars. It's a pity because I won't be as anxious to go back.
