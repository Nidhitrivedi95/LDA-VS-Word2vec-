Da6eZFThE9xanUAGNpZxAg Nuit Social is the perfect spot for a nice, romantic dinner for two. There is indoor seating and a small, enclosed patio of tables outside. If there's good weather, I suggest an outside table.

The charcuterie is where it's at and it would be a shame to leave here without. These boards can be completely customized with selections of meats, cheeses, and olives. There were sooooo many fantastic options and the staff is knowledgeable and can help you make the best selection. 

They have great options for salads and I highly recommend the Arancini, which was little fried balls of saffron rice, sausage, and smoked mozzarella. It was ridiculously good.

Their wine bottles were half off so we ordered one for the table. I'm the only wine drinker in my party so I knew I wouldn't be able to finish (or at least I shouldn't), but the server was happy to recork the bottle and allow me to take it back to my hotel. 

Charcuterie, wine, and ambiance made this such a delightful dining experience. Highly recommend!
