We called in advance to ask if there are vegetarian dishes, as one of our friends is vegetarian. They said yes. We asked if it was possible if 3 out of 4 people can do the tasting menu since one friend is vegetarian. They said it depends on the Maitre d. We decided to go for it since all the reviews were so great.

When we got there, we were greeted by an awesome staff.

However, they did not have anything vegetarian on their menu except some salads and the cheese plate (no vegetarian entrees). However, they wanted to accommodate us so they said they could create something on the spot. YAY! They said they could make risotto, which my friend was extremely happy about. Then, our server came back and said no risotto, just pasta primavera. Friend was disappointed.

We asked about the tasting menu but they told us no can do. The chef does not like it when the whole table does not participate because one person will just nurse one dish the whole night. I guess it's understandable. We all ordered our dishes a la carte.

I had the french onion soup (light and good)
the spinach salad (good, though I could have had it without the raw onions)
the duck for entree (it looked like duck burrito and sliced duck..pics posted)
and for dessert, the grand marnier souffle (it was okay..but by that time i was too full to enjoy it).

I also had some good red wine to accompany my meal.

I thought the meal was pretty good. However, I still wish I could have experienced the full "glory" of Andre's.
