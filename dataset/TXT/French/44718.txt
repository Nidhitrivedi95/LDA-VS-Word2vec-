mnn--vaYHtNyBNYFYBFIog This place show up on just about every "Best of ..." list and deservedly so. The ambience is upscale French with clean lines, plenty of light and elegant décor.
We had the 9 course tasting menu with wine pairings, and this experience is now the benchmark for tastings I have experienced in my life.
Each dish, from the amuse bouche through the dessert, is so artfully presented and with such pinache that the overall experience is difficult to overstate. Expert service accompanied each plating, with clear descriptions of both the dishes and the wines, and enough skill to answer any question we could muster. This was a true gastronomic experience, a journey through flavours, textures and combinations that intrigued, challenged and tantalized the tastebuds in turn.
I can honestly say that now I can check one more experience off my bucket list.
Bravo!
