O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q We popped in for lunch while staying at the Palazzo and checked out Morels.  Really nice setting but we just went for a simple lunch.  Definitely a high end restaurant.  We had a beef deep and cob salad.  Both were very nice but by the time you had ice tea, coffee, and tip, lunch is $60.  So a relaxing lunch but not for the budget conscious.  They also have a patio area that looked nice.
