KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA Went to my favorite little spot by the lake at Desert Shores last friday the 17th with some clients of mine. I was hoping to have the (French Guy) Stephan but, he was, unfortunately for us, on vacation. We made due with our waiter who lacked the color and attention of Stephan. But anyway, the food as always, at least when I'm here, was flawless. The photos I took with my iPhone were not up to my standards so forgive me for not posting.
Will be taking my Pro Canon everywhere I go from now on no matter how obnoxious that that be.
We started with the simple Romaine Salad, crisp and fresh. Then moved right into to main course.
 I had the Pasta Jambalya, the spice in this dish creeps up on you. It took a couple of bites before it hit me. This Entree came with three Jumbo Shrimp, plenty of chicken and sausage and tossed with Fettuccini pasta in a roasted tomato cream.
My clients also enjoyed their dinner. I didn't have a taste and can only say that  they had the Grilled Scotttish Salmon and the Grilled Veal Chop.
We all finished with the simple but great Bread Pudding.
