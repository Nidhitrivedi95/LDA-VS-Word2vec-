A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g I absolutely LOVE coming here for french pastries. This place is doesn't stop amazing me. 
At first I was drawn here because of their delicious french macarons. They are by FAR the best macarons I've had in town. They aren't overpriced, they are $1 each and well worth it. 
I recommend the salted caramel peanut macaron!

Their quiches are really good and they are only $5 so they aren't ripping you off there either. Most of the their meals and sandwiches are decently priced. 

Their coffee is NOT good and definitely needs work in that department. For a french bakery, they shouldn't just have coffee sittin in a pot. 

They don't have selection of flavors and they use the Torani syrups. When I've gone, "sometimes" they have iced lattes sometimes they don't. That department is definitely lacking. 

I was happy to go there before Thanksgiving to grab some treats and I saw that they took orders for pies. A 16" pie only cost $12 whereas a 12" was only $9.  

 I ordered their cinnamon apple pie and it was BOMB. I took it to my parents house and EVERYONE loved it and it was really good with vanilla bean ice cream. 

The crust on the pie was like a flaky crust much like the crosses that were on the pie (it's kind of hard to explain w/o a picture) and the glaze wasn't overbearingly sweet. It was the perfect amount of sweet. 

Anyways, I highly recommend this place. Not ripping you off and good quality. 
 
Only 4 stars (would have had a 5 if coffee/espresso department was on point)
