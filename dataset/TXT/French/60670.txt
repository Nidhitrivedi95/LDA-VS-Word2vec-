SCklYa_jhihWAcfIn-_chg Bonjour Brioche is one of my favorite brunch places in Toronto.  It is a small, french cafe in Leslieville - they serve tarts, croissants, mimosas.  Their food is a little bit lighter than your typical breakfast fare (greasy eggs and bacon).  They also do take out for their baked goods - which is great if you are having a lazy Sunday and don't want to cook.  I would recommend their tarts and pain au chocolate, so delicious!!
The only slight negative is how crowded they are on weekends during brunch hours - it is a small space and they have put as many tables in the space as possible so you are a bit squished.  Trying to get a table for more than four would be a big challenge.
