gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA If I could give a 3.5, I would, but our experience was nice so I'll round up. My boyfriend and I went here to celebrate his 35th birthday. The view is nice as we were there before sunset and were able to see the Las Vegas nightline lit up but it doesn't quite compare since we're in the middle of the dessert. Nonetheless, the ambiance of the restaurant is elegant yet cozy at the same time. The reason for my lower rating is the food was ok. My lobster was tasty but a tad on the creamy side. Perhaps a weekend of decadent food was a bit much for my tastebuds and I wasn't able to fully enjoy the dish. Everything was nice but we weren't wowed, especially with the price you pay and the Michellin rating. The desserts left me wanting more. We would recommend giving the restaurant a chance at least once but no hurry.
