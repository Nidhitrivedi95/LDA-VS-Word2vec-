WOj8nPos3R9IIf0Pyttd8g Interesting mash-up of Southern and French cooking (but not Creole), served in an environment as emotionally warm and cozy as someone's house (which the location was, once upon a time). 

Went for brunch and had the Creme Brûlée French Toast, which was excellent and neither as cloying nor as decadent as the name might seem. Others were also very pleased with their selections. The service was both professional and friendly--other places you often get one or the other, but not both--and we weren't made to feel rushed to leave.

This is a dining choice you won't regret.
