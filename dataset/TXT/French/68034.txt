vg55SAkrEmuHpWfIMtJjBQ Easily the best restaurant in Pittsburgh.  I'm a grad student and therefore don't have a lot of cash, but I will save up to come to legume.  Fantastic staff, fantastic food.  If you can't appreciate what this restaurant is doing in Pittsburgh than I don't know what to tell you.  I also work part time in the service industry and anytime someone asks me for a restaurant recommendation I always suggest legume.
