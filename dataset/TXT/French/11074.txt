4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Quite simply put, some of the best food we've ever eaten. Ordered the mussels, with gluten free bread no less, goat cheese with baby Kale, and local tomato with blue cheese salads, chocolate mousse, salted chocolate, caramel tart and a pair of macchiatos. The waitress earned her 23% tip because her attitude was perfect, her timing was beyond impeccable and the only thing to complain about was the $12 glasses of crappy Sauvignon Blanc and 1.5 mile trek to the bathrooms.
