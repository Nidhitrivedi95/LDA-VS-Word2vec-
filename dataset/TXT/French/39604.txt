jxkr9QI9w_QIG6JgSk7OLA When we go new places we always use yelp to guide us. Tonight was a true hit! We are staying in the neighborhood that this restaurant is in and everything about this place was fantastic! All the food was freshly prepared and homemade. It is a little pricey...but the food is worth every cent! They serve the meals with a homemade gravy that is simply amazing. There were limited options for kids, but the options they had were executed nicely and mimicked the adult options. Our oldest daughter and I shared the chef's platter and the food was both plentiful and extremely tasty. We don't normally do dessert when we go out, but being in a new city and on vacation we splurged and it was a great decision. We shared the creme brûlée, baghlava, and chocolate cake which were all amazing. 

The atmosphere was laid back and relaxed. And the waiter was extremely nice, and very helpful with questions we had about things other than the menu. Can't say enough good things about this place!
