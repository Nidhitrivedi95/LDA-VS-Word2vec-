pKiSzUlBBRNEdTML24piXA The staff is very knowledgable about wine and they have craft and imported beer selections. For dinner we always have the Pancetta wrapped risotto stuffed mushrooms with a tarragon cheese sauce as an appetizer.
Rack of lamb with waffle, fish stew, and their risottos are also standouts. Their menu also includes a vegan option of wood fired vegetables and also homemade focassia (also vegan). Centurion has many delicious wood fired pizzas but their entrees are so good that we often forget about the pizzas. Their menu goes through revision once a year or so and does not currently include steak,  which is disappointing. This is our "go to" place and have frequented them at least every month for at least 2 years. Very good place!
