Kut9tVbDX_f7qKMRRoXg3w The place is decorated in a low budget fake plastic french stuff!
The food was not good at all!  
Service was too much in a hurry! 
The waiter never brought my wifes capuccino.
 And a the worst thing was a ridiculous long standing line to pay your bill!
And they do not accept American Express.
Never again!
