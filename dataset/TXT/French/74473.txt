xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g Absolutely one of my favorite French cuisine in Las Vegas. The atmosphere & view of the strip is stunning! The food is great & the staff were wonderful. We ordered the escargot & scallops for an appetizer. Main entrees was lamb chops & duck breast accompanied by gratin & asparagus. For desserts we had the pistachio & chocolate Souffle oh my oh my words can't describe how delicious & soft it was... It melted right in your mouth & it was just amazing . I would definitely come back here again!.
