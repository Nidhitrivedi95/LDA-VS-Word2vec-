9iy6scMRbs5ue41XRLGEkw Went here for lunch today with a meetup group.  Everyone loved their meals.  Several had the lobster salad croissant (sandwich).  Some had the lamb sandwich which looked delicious!  I had the Blackened Salmon BLT which was also very good.

Service was a little slow, but maybe it was the size of the group or because French cuisine is supposed to be enjoyed.

The restaurant was very quaint and homey.  Loved the ladies restroom--be sure to check it out!

It's a bit pricey, so would only return for lunch.
