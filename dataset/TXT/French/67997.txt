VaFBymfd0f3ykSDX98uawQ Food was good but not great.  Over salted and portions out of balance for a tasting menu.  I wanted to really like this place but I won't be back, with all the phenomenal options in Montreal.  The service was really spotty, and our server basically told us what we wanted instead of having a conversation, which ended up with my friend ending up with a bottle of wine she didn't choose, and a charge for her to have the last glass paired with our meal (we both paid for the pairing), all because we told him she didn't like red wines.
