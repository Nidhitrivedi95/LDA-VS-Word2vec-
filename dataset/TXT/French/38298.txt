JezHN-9KKLTMbojq00VP0g I came here with yelper Yuanjia Z. for brunch, and I have to say this is now one my favorite brunch places! We came here early on a Saturday morning, so we were seated imediately. After browsing through the menu, which has a variety of brunch items ranging from quiches, sandwiches, crepes, omelettes, we decided to share a lemon crepe and a croque monsieur. 

I'm usually not a huge fan of lemon-y desserts, but this may have just changed my view on life entirely! It was perfectly tart without being too sour! The berries and whipped cream added a nice flavor to it as well :) The croque monsieur is like your normal breakfast sandwhich but 1000x better! The bread is dipped in egg and then fried...what? We ordered a fried egg on top of the sandwich (extra $1), which is just mind blowing. The garlic potatoes that came with the sandwich were so good, they were gone in a blink of an eye! 

I definitely recommend this place for brunch! Service is freindly and fast, with fair prices! Great for dates or just chilling with homies :)
