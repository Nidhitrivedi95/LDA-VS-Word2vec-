-Mz3M0g6iFZczs6a7ddf5g If you ask me to recommend a good restaurant for fresh seafood and italien cuisine, this will be the one!!
I went there with two friends. We shared an oysters. Soooooo freeeeesh!
For the main dish, I got lobster risotto. It was so good. The flavour was balanced. The rice was neither too hard nor too sticky. One of my friends got duck meat. It burned a little bit from outside, but the meat inside was delicious! It was not too dry and it had a little bit grilled flavour. Another friend got truffle spaghetti. It tasted so good!
The service is spotless. I also like the ambiance and decorations in the restaurant.
