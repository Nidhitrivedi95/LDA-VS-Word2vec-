XgkTmVrlHHO5g96AfOAfpw I don't normally take to to write reviews but I thought this place was so poor that I had to share.

First - the atmosphere is unchanged from Sonoma and is looking old and tired.

Second - the service was horrible - they had no idea what they were doing.

Third - the food was mediocre at best.

There are too many good restaraunts in Pittsburgh for this to survive.  If you're looking for good french food and a sweet experience go to Paris 66 in the East End.
