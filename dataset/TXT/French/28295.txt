eDtBCZDo92LqBCIfE45hhg This was my last stop in Montreal, I was looking for something upscale but low key and I found  it at Accords.  I walked in with no reservations, but for a Monday night I did not think I needed it and I was correct.  I was offered to dine inside or outside in the patio, I chose the outside option as the weather was nice.  To begin I ordered the  mozzarella bufala from Quebec with tomatoes.  The tomatoes were delicious, however I was a little disappointed with the amount of mozzarella.  I also had the fish tartar and grilled octopus.  Fish tartar was good, however not exactly what I had in mind.  The grilled octopus in the other hand was really good.  I ordered pasta of the day, which had a nice creamy sauce and prosciutto.  Overall is a good place to have dinner, very reasonable prices considering the ambiance the extensive wine choices and very good food.
