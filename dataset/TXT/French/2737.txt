0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g Decided to celebrate my husband's birthday here and I can say that it did not disappoint. The restaurant itself is a relaxing, quiet escape from the chaos of the Las Vegas strip. Not to mention you share a room with 25 Picasso art pieces and can catch a glimpse of the Bellagio water show. 

My husband and I decided to go with the menu degustation and wine pairings. 5 flavorful courses. Our favorite dish was unanimously the scallop. But the lobster salad was up there. I didn't love the lamb as much as my husband but that is no fault to the chef. It was just personal taste and preference. However, it was seasoned well and cooked exactly as I asked. 

I've had some great fine dining before and I give the food 4-4.5 stars. But the 5th star is the service. They come around with bread and water refills enough times without interrupting your conversation. They come back a little after you have received each course to see if you like it. The tastings may look small to some but we were very full by the end! 

Nice, long dinner, with my husband and wine. My favorite thing in the world. Plan to be around for a couple of hours. Took us about 2.5 hours. So don't come with a date who doesn't say much! All around great experience.
