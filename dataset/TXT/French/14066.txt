58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw Came here for brunch one time.  

Interesting setup here.  It's a mini-store that also serve as a restaurant.  

They have communal tables in the back where you can share with other people.  

Pretty wide selection for brunch, good portion, orange juice was great.

Pros - There was a lot of good looking boys at brunch that we stared at! :)
