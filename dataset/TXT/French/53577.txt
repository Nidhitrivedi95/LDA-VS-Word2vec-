qltrxd6_usFu1Q0mM5ZCNQ Fabulous dining experience.  I had the beef shoulder (pictured) and it was one of the most flavorful and tender red meats I have every enjoyed.    La Fabrique leaves cotton candy on the house while you wait for your check!  PS  my dining parter for the night had salmon and loved it!
