Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA Mix lounge is very on or off i think. Sometimes the crowd is really good, but from a couple experiences, it seems just okay. Usually my friend gets us a table and bottle service which helps the situation a bit but as in any case the crowd really dictates the amount of fun you have in any situation.

The view from the top of THE Hotel is pretty amazing, and the exterior elevator makes the trip up more anticipating. Once inside, you pass a small dance floor and head toward the back where the bar is crowned by a red reef-like structure a topped with fiber optic twinkling stars. The music is really good but honestly most of the places in Vegas are good when it comes to that.

Bottomline: It's good, but nothing to write home about. I guess only to write on Yelp about.
