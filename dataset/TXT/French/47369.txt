O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q I've gone here a few times since my fiance seems to really like this place (and we also like the Morels in LA).  Don't get me wrong, the food is pretty good but for the price I think next time I'm suggesting we try another place like Bouchon.  

My fiance surprised me with a 24-hr Vegas trip this weekend for my birthday (she gets 5 stars!).  We got into town at about 3pm and by the time we stopped at a store to buy liquor (including an alcohol infused whip cream) and check into our hotel is was about 4pm.  Since we knew we were going to be drinking heavily we decided to eat heavy early so we're not feeling stuffed by the time we have to go out clubbing.  Morels was close by so went with it. 

Since it was between lunch and dinner the place wasn't busy at all so the service was very quick and attentive.  Although they usually have good service here even if they're busy like the other times I've gone here. 

We started with the Classic Cheese Fondue.  It was pretty good.  I like the flavor of the blend of cheeses with the baguette.    

Then I had the braised short ribs with a side order of mac and cheese.  The short ribs were really good, it just melted in your mouth.  You didn't even need a knife to cut it.  The bordelaise sauce that came with it was a good complement to the flavor of the ribs.  The mac and cheese on the other had was average at best.  It was kinda dry and lacking flavor.

Overall this place is pretty good (food and service) but it's a bit pricey.
