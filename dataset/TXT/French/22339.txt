BSmqxPbQglQwP2R56OqOag A little gem tucked in a shopping center.  
Went there based on a recommendation.  Loved the menu, the service, the design (great design) and, yes, the food.  
Waiter traded us up to "drunken bread".
YUM!  Fondue in a skillet!  We had the farm salad,  incredibly fresh!  Truffle Mac.  
French Onion Soup smothered in grueyreSalad. My husband is still raving about it.  
And, we arrived at 10:30pm.  No one rushed us.
