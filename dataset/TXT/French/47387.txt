O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q After eyeing this place for some time, Diane selected Morels for her birthday dinner.  It was our first time here but will not be our last..

We were initially presented with a salty Olive Tapenade, butter with Hawaiian Sea Salt, and delicious soft warm rolls.  Quickly following were Wild Caught Prawns that were cold and meaty, and a Horseradishy Cocktail Sauce.  My other preliminary course was a crock of excellent sweet Onion Soup Gratinee with a large and well-deconstructed crouton and well-melted Comte and Gruyere Cheeses.

Both of us then enjoyed the night's featured Surf & Turf Special of Filet and Half-Lobster.  We each received a very nice lobster half and a nicely seasoned 8 oz. Filet with little char cooked perfectly medium rare as ordered.  The lobster meat was sweet dipped in either drawn butter or specially requested Buerre Blanc, and ran out just a few bites ahead of the Filet.  Excellent whipped Mashed Potatoes accompanied the combo entree.  Three flavored sea salts were also provided: Black Hawaiian Sea Salt, Smoked Black Sea Salt, and Red Hawaiian Sea Salt.

We finished with very good Classic Profiteroles served with Candied Vanilla Almond Ice Cream and Malted Chocolate Sauce.  I just wish there had been more ice cream.

Our booth back was hard but seating was otherwise comfortable, with a nice cushioned bottom.  Sensually appealing fine art adorned several walls.

Service was excellent except for tea sweeteners initially being removed prematurely.  Chamomile Decaf Iced Tea was specially made for me, with needed refills quickly supplied without request.  The dining room was not that crowded on a Saturday night.                 

In sum, we found Morels to be an upscale dining venue with a nice classy ambiance, fine food, and excellent service!
