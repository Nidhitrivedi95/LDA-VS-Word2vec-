O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q Decided to try the Brunch at Morels on a Sunday.  A short wait put us at the bar for a quick cappuccino, then on the patio as requested.  Service, food, selection, menu adjustments all fantastic.  This would be a 5-star rating were it not for the fact that they made me cash out my cappuccino bill at the bar, and carry it myself to the table.  This caliber of restaurant should have been a bit more on top of that inconvenience.  Otherwise, very positive!
