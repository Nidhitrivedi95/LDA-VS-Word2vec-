4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I have had two excellent experiences here and will always keep this on the list for Vegas trips.  Amazing breakfast with bachelor party buddies with just enough pomp and circumstance for a celebratory weekend.  Then, I had lunch on my last trip and really liked the French simple options for a moderate price.  In addition, they have wonderful house wines bottled for them in France.  Highly recommend as long as that does not make the line longer for me.
