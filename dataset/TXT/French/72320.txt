XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q Maybe French just isn't for me. We got the 16 course tasting menu, and since we had a rather large group, were placed in the small room to the side - the service was impeccable, if a bit formal (it was hard to get them to join in on our jokes or crack a smile when we directed them at the waiters),  half of the courses were mindblowing and the other half were meh, and my sea bass was overcooked.

 At the same time though, when it was good, it was amazing. I loved the foie gras salad, the caviar, which was served with yellowtail carpaccio, salmon tartare,  breads (bacon bread!), mushroom preparation, and pumpkin veloute, but the amuse bouche of green apple/grapefruit was probably one of the more off things I've ever tasted and everything else started blending into a mass of creamy dishes in my head and tongue. Which is sad, because if you have stuff like veal, lobster, and seared scallop at a 3-michelin star restaurant, hopefully they would be more memorable. The desserts were okay, I preferred the ganache to the coffee cake, and luckily since I'm a girl, I got chocolates for the next day in a gift bag when we left :)

I can't complain though, dinner was comped for me. (Thanks!) I don't know if it would have been worth the money normally, as I enjoyed our dinner at Central Michel Richard the next night far more, but there were dishes that were very, very memorable at Joel Robuchon, and bites of those were almost transcendental.
