yPIosRz_YOL_nUtmGb88kw Decided to give this cute place a try after getting sick of super expensive tourist food and I'm glad we did!  It's a little bit tucked away in a quiet residential neighborhood but the food, the service, and the general ambience (diners are mostly local families and couples) were all quite lovely. It does justice to its mission statement of providing French food at a good price: A full 3 course meal (soup/salad, entree, dessert and coffee/tea) runs less than 20$ and the wine list is reasonably priced as well. The food is solid--can't say I'm a connoisseur but I enjoyed my duck confit as much as one I had in Paris and my family members all liked their food, as well. The host/waiters were friendly and had great timing--we never felt like we were waiting for long or were rushed. Slight imperfections (a wilted salad leaf, a dropped glass) keep this place from a total 5 star review but it's close enough... Would give it 4.5 stars if I could!
