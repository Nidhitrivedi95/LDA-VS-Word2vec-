Yp9w4nhUowBU_IS_StFXbQ I left this establishment very impressed.  The service was on par with some of the most expensive restaurants I have been to without the corresponding exorbitantly priced food.  

My family enjoyed a delightful brunch here, and I really can't recommend it enough.  The menu was varied and wide ranging, truly a comprehensive list that everyone could enjoy.  The wine/champagne was not as reasonably priced as I would like, but given the price and quality of the food... there are absolutely no complaints here.  The blueberry ricotta pancakes, and smoke salmon dishes were quite good.  The NY steak sandwich was so so.  

If you must entertain a large party, this really is the place to do it.  All your guests will feel like they just had a lavish brunch; however, your wallet will thank you (surprising given its location in the Wynn).

For all the praise, one might wonder, "Why only four stars then?"  Well, I dunno how to say this... purse stands.  There are friggin' stands for your purses!  A little stand the waiter brings over, so your purse can rest upon it.  The seating was divine (the round room looking at the pool area), the table setting was beautiful, the shades and decorations pleasant to all, but lo and behold to truly capture the "elegance", purse stands are provided.
