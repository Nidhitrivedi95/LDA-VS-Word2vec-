jaSowNITPRRCYpPb3_pjdA Solid 4.5 since 5 is reserved for above and beyond...

Pros:

- Lobster was delic.!  Peeps burgers and steak dishes were killed.

- Great portion for the price and good selection for lunch!

- Customer Service...as a team, they worked great together.  They even offer 10% discount on the next lunch visit with a receipt.

Cons:

- Customer Service...mixed up included green salad vs fries, but was quickly addressed and the fries was included at no charge.  Missed my lemons with my water and a bit slow on others refills.  They're new, just need more time to floss out the minor kinks.

- Fries was kind of salty...maybe it was just me having a low sodium preference.

- We were placed in the back of the restaurant when there was only two other parties there.  No biggie...just odd, but it worked out cause we were kind of laughing too much.

Stars:

- Luis G. provided great service!
