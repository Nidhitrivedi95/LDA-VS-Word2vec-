A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g I like that they took my cake order over the phone and had it ready for me when I arrived.  It was the tiramisu cake - and was a little disappointed that the cake to cream ratio was off.  Too much cream - we threw away most of it since it was mostly cream and shaved chocolate. The flavor was delicate but would not order it again.  I happened to notice they had fresh baked bread when I picked up the cake - and THAT was outstanding!  LOVE the bread - what a total win by accident for my group.  Coming from the NYC city area and used to high priced items - I was surprised at the price of macarons - 1.50+$ each and the size of a quarter.  I decided not to try one out of principle alone.  They are too far out of the way to get that kind of money for such a tiny pastry.  Overall very pricey in my opinion.
