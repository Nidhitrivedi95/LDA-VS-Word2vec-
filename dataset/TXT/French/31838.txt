Gu-xs3NIQTj3Mj2xYoN2aw Ive had their strawberry meringue cake here twice. I love its flavour and textures combined and love that its too sweet or hard. The price is decent and I go out of my way to get the cake because you cant get it anywhere else to my knowledge. Be careful if you are ordering any of the other cakes as many include rum inside as an ingredient.
