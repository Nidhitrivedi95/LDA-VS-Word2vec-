4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw We went to Mon Ami Gabi after the cirque show for a quick bite. The chicken liver pate was delicious, the mustard that is served with it really complements it and elevates the flavor. My husband ordered a cocktail, however he thought it was a bit too expensive for the quality. We also ordered some frites, warmed Brie and trout dish. All very delicious. Our waitress was super, she had a little bit too much on her plate when we first got there, however she got more attentive towards the end. She packed us the leftovers, which were a good breakfast for the next day. Outdoor sitting seemed a little scary as it was chilly outside, but those heating lamps really keep it warm.
