_cjPEH9wXhKS-HQe_U3M4Q It's been 5 months since I came back from Paris.  I miss the charming bistros that are seemingly everywhere in Paris.  Not so plentiful in Toromto but Le Select certainly helps!

The Yelp reviews complained about service and food but my experience was all positive.  Fresh bread, good food, and nice ambiance.   When in Paris... Or when downtown ... Come in have a glass of wine and enjoy...
