rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Went on Monday around 11:30 and we were seated right away.  I've been to Bouchon three times.  The first two times were great but this time I ordered tuna sandwich with fries and the taste was just okay, nothing special. cost $17.   My hubby ordered steak sandwich $18 and it's much better than tuna.
