QeFsIMcIFIJcOrpthYL8jg This was a lovely experience.  It says it isn't recommended for kids but the waitstaff was super accommodating.  We have a a toddler and it was fine for us both times we dined there both at lunch and dinner.  Once with a reservation and once without.  The food was really good and in the evening we lucked out on the jazz singer upstairs.

It would be a nice place to sit at the bar and just listen as well as dine.  We tried pasta, lamb and game and all dishes were prepared very well and were seasonal.

The suggestions were always good and the service was always prompt and courteous despite the crazy waits of the high season.

Would highly recommend.
