IUtjbbqQ6jUSi4t2jjgYRA I am a huge fan of Greek town and almost all the shops and stores there, this place definitely included. It's a lovely car right along the danforth in the heart if Greek town.  The speciality coffee were absolutely delicious and they had great cheeses to pair with any wine or beverage. Service was very attentive and conversational. The owner greeted us warmly and made us feel very welcome and he was very open to talking about the products and options for each menue item. This is a definite gem in this neighbourhood. It is quite small so it is better to go for a date or intimate outing, but it's absolutely lovely for that, one of my faves!
