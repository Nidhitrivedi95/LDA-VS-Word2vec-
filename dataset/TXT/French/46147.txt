myJ6pgIhN42EQh2sAVXKoQ Toma reminds me of the home of my previous favorite gourmet burger 'n fries from Twigs, a small regional chain in the pacific NW, as both made me feel like I should deduct a star from all prior reviews of other places, and both have woefully mediocre ratings on Yelp. 

Getting there and finding parking was a bit of a nightmare, even though we managed to snag a spot right in front on our second pass. I worried anything less than a spectacular meal would make the venture feel like more trouble than it was worth. 

My fear subsided when we entered a small, attractive restaurant with spacious leather booths and cozy pillows.  By the time I took a sip of my "bourbonade," a concoction of bourbon, lemonade, lime and mint, I knew everything would be just fine.

"Is it not good?" The bartender Gerard asked, concerned. I can only assume he mistook the tears in my eyes for displeasure. I quickly assured him it was wonderful. Surprisingly refreshing, and just what I needed.

My husband and I shared a large order of truffle fries but small would have been adequate. Truthfully, the truffle oil is a bit much toward the bottom of the dish, but I loved the fries. They are good alone, but magic in garlic aioli.

I had the cheesy sans onions. The burger was juicy despite being medium and the house-made brioche bun was excellent. My husband had the old timer, and enjoyed it. My sons had kids' meals but didn't come close to finishing because they're actually normal sized burgers. 

In fact, food here is a great value overall. Portions are very generous. Service is thoughtful and excellent, and sustainability an appreciated focus.

If they expand, I hope their next location is Niagara Falls.
