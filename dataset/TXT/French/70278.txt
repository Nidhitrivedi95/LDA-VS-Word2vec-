x1bjSvpIJTN1KBFhUjOU_g Chez Jules is a bit of a caricature of a French bistrot, the decor and the cheesy background music contributing to that a  lot. 
Chez Jules is also great because it's a non-pretentious place where you can get good food at decent prices at any time in the afternoon.  It is thus the perfect place for a late Saturday lunch with (preferably) a bunch of cheery friends. 
The steak is awesome.  I like their 'cote de boeuf' and hurray, they can make it blue!  Steak is served with a pan of gratin dauphinois so if a few people at the table order steak then we all get to share a huge pan of yummy gratin.  The steak tartare is not bad either and I've heard that the seafood and fish dishes are damn good too.

Minus points:
Service can be a bit slow
The cheesy music (although I guess it makes a great conversation topic)
Can get very noisy at busy times and make conversation difficult
I find the set lunch menu not so great (but, for £8, I guess you can't complain)

Plus points:
Great a la carte or specials
Fab gratin dauphinois
Salad, bread, olives and charcuterie brought on arrival
Very drinkable house red
Open all day from 12 noon
No frills place
Friendly owner
The 'rincette' coffees (you gotta have one of those!)

Overall, highly recommended for a casual lunch or dinner with friends.  I love this place and I can't believe I only went for the first time 2 months ago!
