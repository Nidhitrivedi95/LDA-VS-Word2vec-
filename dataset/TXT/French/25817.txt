Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA We stayed at TheHotel, and naturally went upstairs to Mix. 

The view is absolutely breath-taking at night.

Our server were extremely kind, even on a busy night. Cocktails were delicious and made with an even hand. They packed a punch, but were delightful. 

It is a great place to begin your night.
