oZHbPhIj01_31jqD053a_Q I am banging out some long overdue reviews and had to put in 5 stars for Europea.

Enjoyed the tasting menu with a good friend in 2014, but still remember the meal fondly as if it were last night.  Creative, confident food that truly reached WOW FOOD status.

Two bottles of excellent wine and 12 courses from Lobster, foie gras, caviar, smoked salmon to a picture worthy cotton candy tree.

To this day, one of my top 5 meals of all time.  Compares with E' by Jose Andres, Gabriel Kreuther, and Mario Batali at his best.
