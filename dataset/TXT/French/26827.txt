Dcj69NZJnbJhK-YHP_nULA Brasserie V - what does the V stand for? My most recent vice.

My criteria for a good restaurant (in order of importance):
1. Beer
2. Food
3. Service

WARNING: This place is hopping, so be ready for a wait, but it's well worth it!

The beer selection is phenomenal.  Belgian beers are infinitely complex and notoriously delicious.  Add to that an entire book of beer choices and you have an impossible decision to make. Luckily, Brasserie V's staff is knowledgeable and friendly, ready to help you make such a critical decision.

The food is SOOOO GOOOOOOD. I have never had anything I didn't love here.  Moules, frites, burgers, chicken or tuna salad sandwiches at lunch - variety with quality. I'm actually on their wifi right now, writing this review, and eating tonight's special: a burger with egg, crimini and oyster mushrooms, and rosemary and truffle bernaise sauce on sourdough. Only $13! Oh shit. The guy next to me just got the duck breast with door county cherries and red wine sauce. I guess I have to come back tomorrow.

The service: this is why I'm a regular. I live nearby and the staff is so much fun that I'm content to hang out at the bar and chat them up for a few hours while they endow me with sample upon sample of whatever 4 new beers they have on tap this week.
