Early morning 7am arrived.  

Ann was an excellent server.  Coffee, water spot on (and I like coffee). 

The chef altered my order as requested.  

The manager showed care for my table.  

......just be a little patient about seating.   They are multi tasking.  

Thank You! You made my mad Monday off to a wonderful start!
