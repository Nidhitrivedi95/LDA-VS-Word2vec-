Waitress was friendly
Decor and seating was mostly clean and basic for a standard place like this-  nothing really to wow about but nothing to complain about either-  we took a couple muffins to go since we were leaving town and those were good, kept their softness and freshness for several hours until we enjoyed them.

All in all- it's basic average.
