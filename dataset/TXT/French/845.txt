_cjPEH9wXhKS-HQe_U3M4Q Had brunch here with friends this past Sunday. The food was pretty good but definitely heavy. About 70% through what felt like a 5 egg goat cheese omelette I hit a wall. I plowed through it afterwords of course, but I still hit it regardless. They're definitely pouring heavy cream into these bad boys for sure.

Heart stopping brunch for 2 (including a 5oz glass of freshly squeezed OJ) will come out to just under $50. It's pricey for breakfast, but if you aren't doing it all the time what the hell. Giv'er.

Hash browns good. 
Complimentary pre-entry mini baguette good.

Also, Anne Hathaway served our food.
