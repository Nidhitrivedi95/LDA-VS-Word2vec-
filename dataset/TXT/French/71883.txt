XI3iNUgChOfJk5ppjKVEQQ AMAZING!!!!

Top 5 meals of my life!  Sat at the bar and had Julienne as our waiter/bartender.  Besides the fact that he is super cute....he is super nice and has a wonderful personality!  
The cocktails were delicious and very unique!  The appetizer my husband got, the Burrata,  was completely out of this world!  His quote..."i've never eaten anything that when I finished it, I immediately wanted to order another"

Both our dinners were excellent and the desserts were an amazing end to an overall amazing experience!

This is a must stop when in Montreal!
