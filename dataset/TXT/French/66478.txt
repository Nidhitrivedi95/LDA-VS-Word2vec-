uP3H5bcsiTXM0k0xQhRndg We visited this hidden gem during a conference Montreal. Having read Yelp reviews, we knew to get there early and to order the Mac and cheese. And Oh. My. God. Was it delicious! The salty-sweet "Christmas ham" on top combined with the cream based sauce and truffle oil to create a unique flavor I had never before encountered. Every now and then I would crunch on a salt crystal. Unreal. Paired w a local blond beer, this was my favorite meal in Montreal hands down. Don't miss it!
