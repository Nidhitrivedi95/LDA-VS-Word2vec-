Tl2nqtPXlLbAG3qkUYVM2g If you are looking for a special dining experience, look no further. Chef Vincent Guerithault is from Provence, France, and combines his expertise in classic French cooking with southwestern ingredients making for unique...and exceptionally delicious offerings. From the moment you walk in the door, you know right away you are somewhere special - and you are treated like someone special. The staff is very attentive, yet almost invisible. The menu changes according to season and availability of fresh ingredients - but one thing you can take to the bank - whatever you select, it will be delicious. Be sure and save room for dessert - they are to die for!!
Bon appetite!
