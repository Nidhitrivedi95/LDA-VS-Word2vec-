...the view from above is amazing and makes your overall dining experience that much better. Bentley's has a clean atmosphere, simple decoration and tons of light coming in through the wall-sized windows surrounding the entire dining area.

I've had the unique pleasure of eating here on numerous occasions and while it would seem that a place so upscale and sophisticated would cost you a week of lunch money, a quick look at the menu keeps your feet on the ground. 

Every dish on this menu is delicious and there's really nothing you can hold against the food here - especially not the prices. A new york strip over roasted potatoes and green beans with a pepper sauce goes for $18 at lunch.... that's probably the most ridiculous thing I've heard in culinary pricing. The almond crusted trout is sublime - crispy, savory and colorful. Bentley's presentation though is what really makes the food stand out (see photos). You can tell they have perfectionists in the kitchen because each dish comes out like a piece of artwork and the portion size is generous - even by American standards.

If you have an hour for lunch this is the place to go. It's never too busy at lunch time... because most people don't have time to fine dine in the middle of the day, but my experience each time has been consistently good. Frankly, I can't think of any other restaurant in uptown that stands up to this one at lunch. Not even Ruth's or McCormicks. If you're looking to just snack, they even have light appetizers like French onion soup and a variety of gourmet salads.

Definitely worth the ride up the elevator!
