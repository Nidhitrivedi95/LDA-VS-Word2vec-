QEgfK_TKY8bwK-YzKDdkGw Oh, this is something very, very special. Service was flawless and the food was fresh, inventive and deeply satisfying.

Starters: african prawn on risotto, blue-fin tuna tartar
Salad:: Moroccan Dates stuffed with Chevre
Main: Duck a l'Orange, Filet mignon
Dessert: Apple tarte tatin, spiced cake with pear and ice cream

Yea... that's decadent but the portions are sized such that it's all manageable. I watch too many high-end cooking shows and I'm often left asking myself: "Where could I eat THAT in Charlotte?" I now have an answer.

Yes, I have been overly critical in my 4-star rating. However, at this level of dining I'm deducting a single star as the steak was more medium than medium rare. I am however looking forward to return again and again until I find the missing fifth star.
