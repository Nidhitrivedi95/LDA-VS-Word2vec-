cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg A recent compliment from another Yelper reminded me that I haven't reviewed this place on Yelp yet. So thanks Betty B for reminding me!

I have a friend who grew up in Montreal (he speaks fluent French, Italian & English) who told a work colleague and I to spend the weekend in Montreal with him after attending a conference in Toronto for the week. We took him up on his offer and this dining extravaganza was the culinary highlight of the trip.

This was just before the ban on foie gras went into effect in California, so our friend took us here to make sure we could overload on it...and we did.

There was so much that looked so good on the menu, three grown men wept with joy and giggled like schoolgirls.

Even though it's not on the menu right now, the foie gras with maple syrup was amazing. We then dove straight into a second foie gras dish,  naked foie gras.

Our third foie gras foray was the foie gras poutine...NOT to be missed!

Then we had a pig dish and the Fowl for 2, which put us over the top. They were both completely off the hook. The whole chicken had a morel mushroom gravy that was so good you could have filled a coffee mug full of it and drank it straight down.

The wines?  Oh...the wines... 

Their French wine selection was ridiculously amazing. We guzzled bottle after bottle with our meal like we were with Bacchus himself.

Then came the desserts. It may have been the foie gras delirium, but each one was better than the last. We ordered three, struggled to finish them, but we had to because they were so good.

Hours after we got there, we stumbled outside feeling sated & slightly sinful at the end of this magnificent foie gras feast. 

Bottom line? If you are within 500 miles of Montreal, make a trip to the wonderful city and this deliciously decadent restaurant. You'll thank me if you do.
