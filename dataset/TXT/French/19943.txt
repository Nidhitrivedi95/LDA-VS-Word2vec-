aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw 3.5 stars, but rounding down because i've had a lot better and cheaper macaroons & croissants in LA.

Bouchon for breakfast: check!
Bouchon Bakery for dessert: check! (enjoyed this more than the restaurant)
* located inside the Venetian
* don't mistaken this stand alone mini bake shop for the restaurant



2 small macaroons + 1 cappuccino= $12.25! yikes---that's Vegas for ya! 

Never the less----the macaroons were pretty good (pistachio and coffee). The sweetness level was perfect. They're a bit bigger in size than your typical macaroons. 

cappuccino: since the SMALL cup I ordered at the restaurant was not satisfying enough----i ordered another LARGE cup of cappuccino. Nothing too special about it, BUT it did go very well with the macaroons. 

Also, sampled my friend's goodies:
- chocolate croissant: good, but i've had better and a lot cheaper at the local donut shops near my shop.
- strawberry danish/croissant: not too sweet= good.
