KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA Horrible!!!! Went yesterday with a group of friends for lunch. The waiter did not know the menu. He told me the turkey sandwich comes on a sub roll. When my sandwich came it was on bread with Rye. I do not like Rye. He took it away to remake it. Minutes later another person comes back with the same sandwich telling me it was not Rye, you could see the seeds all over the bread. I was told they were going to remake the entire sandwich. They take it away again to make it on white. When I finally got my sandwich it was not a "new" sandwich, they just put white bread on it. The sandwich is supposed to be hot, it was not. It was cold. Yuck! By the time I got my sandwich everyone had finished eating. I paid for a terrible sandwich that arrived after my friends had eaten. Very slow service!!!!  I have been here many times before with friends. This is my last time.
