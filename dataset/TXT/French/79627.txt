zqNgwQjj0_XAll-neGikIw Hands down the BEST French onion soup in the valley.  Made to order and absolutely delicious.  Cafe is quaint and comfortable, service friendly and welcoming.  Also had the lamb burger as well as the spinach and goat cheese quiche.  Both were memorable as well.  Found a new little neighborhood spot I'll be returning to frequently!
