rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Well this is the thing, 

When you stay at the Venetian hotel, you kinda have to act like you're someone special or some kind of a big shot. So, your breakfast (at least once) has to be taken at Bouchon (with french accent please, merci)

#1 highlight: their baked sourdough fresh hot bread, amazing just by itself, comes with butter and delicious homemade peach jam.

#2:  the cafe latte was very good, intense espresso's bitterness and the milk's accompaniment made it smoother for your oral cavity.

#3: nuttela spread (you can never go wrong with nuttela no matter what) AND their baked bread, you hear the bread crunching along with nuttela's presence to get you in one of the best euphoric stages, especially when two annoying loud guys are sitting next to you, it helps a lot, not to hear their annoying voices and hear the crunch with the nuttela and forgetting that they're there. 

#4: it's exactly next to the small pool of the Venezia lobby (Venetian Hotel), so you just go straight to the pool.

#5: Spending the day at the pool, you can get nice overpriced cocktail drinks from Bouchon, but relieve your bankruptcy pain with the thought  that you just live once and you better enjoy your life to the fullest, by ordering $12 iceplended margaritas and raspberry caipirinha in plastic cups. 

#6: good service

Au beintot!
