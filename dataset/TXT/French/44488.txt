ME6D5nLlfG0xZCtICOYDuw Hosted a bridal shower here recently and the service provided to us was great. The servers were extremely attentive to everyone, the mimosas were kept coming and the food was plentiful. We had a special menu created for our party but I'm sure everything they offered is on their regular menu. I ordered the Broccoli Soup as the starter. The soup was chunky! Oh my God! Plentiful pieces of broccoli and at the right temperature. You could easily get full from the soup so I made sure to save some space for my entree which I ordered the French Toast. That too was really good. And parking is pretty simple. A short walk from the garage.
