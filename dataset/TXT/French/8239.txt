4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw My friends and I were in Vegas the past weekend to celebrate two of my friend's birthday. One of the nights, we decided to try Mon Ami Gabi because of all the rave reviews we've been reading and hearing about this place, so I made a reservation for dinner service. We were promptly greeted and escorted to our table when we arrived, had our orders taken, and quickly served bread and butter. So far the service and experience had been good up until the point at which we receive our food. My friend asked for his steak to be medium rare and it came out medium. Okay, not a problem since this is a French steakhouse maybe they messed up because too many people ordered it and they just forgot. So we sent it back to the kitchen and he received another steak. The new steak is then cut into and we found it disgustingly BLUE and for the people who don't know, blue means the steak was RAW on the inside. I had to speak up and ask our waiter to cook the steak another time and insisted it be medium rare this time around before my friend finally receive the steak cooked to the temperature that was requested. What angers me is how the staff handled the situation, no deep apologies, comps, perks or anything. In addition, how the hell does a French STEAKHOUSE not know how to cook steak?!!?!? Let's just say this place will definitely not be getting my business after this horrible experience.
