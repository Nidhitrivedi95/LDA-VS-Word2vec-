4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw The ambience and service were above average but what anyone should expect at this price point. The 1/2 baguette served in the traditional paper bag was a nice hint of Paris but the food was only average. The escargot was ok... but much better elsewhere. The steak was well cooked (I like mine medium rare) but lacked flavor and was very thin. I opted not to have dessert because a meal for one with a glass of Beaujolais was already nearing $65 not including tip- probably cheap for Vegas but a lot for only an average meal.
