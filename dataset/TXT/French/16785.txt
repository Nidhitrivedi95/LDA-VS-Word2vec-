8xCiibfgqy-8xpCWEaguqg My first time eating at this Keg. Similar experience to other Kegs. Very dark lighting. Washrooms were interesting though, they were upstairs, had to climb a flight of stairs to get to them. Parking was pretty convenient, had to park on the street, but it's Downtown and wasn't too far of a walk. I ordered the Baseball Top Sirloin. The reason why it's called a baseball is because it's very thick and shaped like a....baseball! So thick that they can only cook it to rare or medium rare, no well done! You start off with your choice of a salad, I opted for the Caesar Salad. I felt that they put wayyyy too much dressing on that salad and very little croutons, so the salad was too salty for my liking. The Keg dish comes with a side of veggies and sautéed mushrooms and a side to go with it, but since it's the Keg, you gotta order the twice baked potato. To top it off, I got a slice of their Billy Miner Pie for my birthday to go as my dessert.
