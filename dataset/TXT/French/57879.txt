rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A MR says ... if this is how I'm going to get my breakfast, I don't mind having this every single day

MRS says ... first let me get this out of the way. DON'T GET the CORNED BEEF HASH. It wasn't what I expected it to be. Basically, it was more like diced or chopped ham and potatoes. I was hoping the corned beef to be like shredded corned beef like the ones you eat during St. Patrick's day. I was disappointed BUT taste was alright. The over-easy egg helped make it better for me :) 

Do get the CHICKEN & WAFFLE!!! It's the BEST! and that's what they're known for. We had some pastry sampler (croissant, raspberry donuts like munchies, chocolate croissant and a pecan/walnut? type muffin). Good variety selected by our nice server.
