We ordered:

La Boulangerie--4 breads (pain au raisin, butter croissant, canelé, and kouign amann
Pâté de Campagne
Crudités (complimentary) 
Foie gras parfait
Tarte flambée
Blue crab crèpe
Onion soup
Escargots Bardot
Croque Madame
Hunter's waffle
French toast
Mac and cheese
Parisian gnocchi
Heritage Chicken rôti with mushroom and brioche pudding
Chocolate macaron
Apple tart tatin
Mille feuille

We started with some small baguettes and salted butter.  Of the hors d'oeuvres we ordered, my favorites were the pâté, foie gras, and blue crab crèpe.  The paté had nuts in it that really enhanced the flavor with this wonderful texture.  The foie gras was so easy to spread on the grilled bread and was very tasty.  The gelée topping the foie was thin and didn't inhibit the flavor of the foie from coming through.  I was less than impressed with the escargots.  The presentation is very clever--encasing the snails in puff pastry--but I am more a traditionalist and like them oozing butter as you remove them from shells with lots of butter and garlic. 

On to more main course items, the French toast was the star.  This was thick brioche soaked in custard and done to a beautiful brown color.  Served with chive mascarpone and some candied almonds it was simply superb!  Soft, flavorful, and decadent.  The heritage chicken and a nice crispy skin and the chicken was very moist.

Always the fan for desserts, my favorites were the chocolate macaron, large in size, with melted chocolate drizzled over the top before dividing and the mille feuille with wonderful pastry filling between the flaky layers.

The restaurant has all the appearance of a French bistro.  Service was excellent.
