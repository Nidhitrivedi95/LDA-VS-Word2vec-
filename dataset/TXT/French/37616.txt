jA3xcba82t8x06H8NzG4VQ My boyfriend and I love going to The Black Pig on special occasions, so naturally we decided to visit the new location for our anniversary.  Everything was incredible!  The new space is very elegant and much more romantic than the 25th location was.  We sat in the front dining room and love the charm of the paned front window and interior design details.  The menu felt very refined and mature, in the character of their new space.  Our favorites (charcuterie, house made sausage, pork belly, cheeses and truffle dessert) were still in the mix, along the some enticing new options.  We tried the heart tartare and were very impressed.  I am looking forward to visiting again soon with  some of my girlfriends to try the chef's other new additions to the menu.  I have some food allergies, and the server and kitchen were very knowledgeable and accommodating.  I love that the new menu subtly includes notations about which items are gluten free!  At the end of the meal, to top it all off, the chef showed us their new private dining room on the second level.  Hats off, Black Pig!  You continue to impress us.  Congratulations on your new space.
