3jKUbhGSjFTv5jZ0wnW0xA 1 star for being accommodating and seating us during peak time without a reservation. 1 star for the decent sangaria (I asked for white, but they brought a red one...oh well, it was not bad). The staff was running around the place like crazy. We started with the goat cheese salad, but the cheese was Brie (although the owner tried to assure us it was goat...no way!). Main course was file mignon....I know my steaks and that was at best a sirloin (bad quality sirloin). Well cooked but very chewy and not edible! The other course was an overlooked sole, tasted fresh, but very overlooked. Surprised by the 4-star Yelp rating. Disappointed this was our last dinner in MTL. Had a great dinning experience otherwise at L'express and Bonaparte.
