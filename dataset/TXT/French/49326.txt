or4UVDjXEEjze3wNPjoAZA Amazeballs. That's French for something good, right?

It's not...It's English for freaking amazing, which is the best way I could possibly describe Zinc Bistro. Top to bottom, a fantastic meal.

Started with Duck pate, my wife had a salad,  we each had the flat iron steak at the recommendation of the server, and we shared a chocolate souffle for dessert.

Going piece by piece...Salad was very good, fresh greens, vinaigrette and a warm chevre crouton that was delicious. The duck pate was very flavorful and rich, served with marbled rye bread, an herb infused creme fraiche, cornichon, and some sort of meat gelee (which weirded me out). That was a dynamite appetizer, incredibly rich and satisfying. 

Our flat iron steaks were cooked to medium rare perfection, pepper crusted, and finished with a red wine reduction and shallots, which created an awesome sauce to dip the pomme frites that came with the steak. Special shout out to the chef(s) at Zinc, the steaks were really cooked perfectly. So often even at really top end steak houses, medium rare can mean medium. This was not the case at Zinc, which I appreciated. Pomme frites were great, crispy and flavorful, and were awesome when dipped in the sauce.

The souffle to finish was incredible. You get your choice of a finishing sauce (we chose chocolate), so you get the cakey exterior, warm, soft interior, molten center and then the sauce that pairs well with the whole thing. A wonderful way to cap the meal.

I had a Manhattan after dinner that was good, service was very good, timely and attentive, with spot recommendations as well. I also love the atmosphere at Zinc. They do a nice job making it feel Parisian (without the smoking and the judgement...I kid, France...I kid).

All in all a wonderful meal, and I am sure to be back to Zinc soon!
