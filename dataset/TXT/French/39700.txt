K1Y1cQT6KuWOfAoDbDIh_g Classy, quiet restaurant. You'll see some white haired Montreal politicians every time. The place you'd go for a special birthday or anniversary. The waiters are polite, pleasant, and funny if you get them going. The food is downright perfect, french cuisine. Be sure to get the Escargot.
