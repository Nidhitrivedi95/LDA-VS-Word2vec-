The location is great since it is right across from the Bellagio Fountain. You have front seat views of the water show if you sit outside.  I've been here at least 5 times now and so far I have not been disappointed.

The escargot is a must, especially if you've never had escargot before. I am not an escargot connoisseur but I find that it tastes quite nice with all the garlic and seasonings. The price is around $10 for a serving of 6 pieces.

Also, their steaks are divine. I enjoy a good steak and they definitely know how to please my palate when it comes to steak. 

My sister had the salmon salad, which she thought was excellent.

Overall, it's probably one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas.
