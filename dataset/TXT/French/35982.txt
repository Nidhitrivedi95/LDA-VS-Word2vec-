hvjgF-vnPw2jyL5DBuB0qg Probably should have ordered more seafood but we ended up with more of the other dishes.

The beef tartare and ricotta were my favorites that we had. Did not like the chestnut tortelloni and pork tenderloin. The scallops and the mushroom toast were just ok.

A cozy, dark restaurant with the menu on one chalkboard. Our server was very helpful and attentive.
