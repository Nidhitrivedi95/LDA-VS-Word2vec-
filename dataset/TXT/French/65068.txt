Tl2nqtPXlLbAG3qkUYVM2g It is easy for me to overlook the dated decor that reminds me of old steak houses the service was so exceptional and the food was dependable to up to masterful .
Our knowledgeable waiter explained most of the menu and gave detail to where meats were sourced from .

We started with the corn ravioli's with truffle oil , the flavors went together well and it was a nice size portion for two to start with.

We both thought the salad of radicchio , endive , walnuts , pears , and gorgonzola was a perfect balance of taste and texture in a generous portion for two to share .

My husband had the wild boar loin that came with a very rich sauce to balance the extremely  lean meat . He said the sauce was a little spicy , beefy rich and well made the flavors went nicely with the addition of mushrooms . The wild boar plate also came with buttery mashed potatoes and buttery fresh vegetables .

I had the Scottish Salmon that was seared on the top but prepared almost medium well . The Salmon came with a red pepper lightly creamed sauce and  haricot verts , asparagus , sugar snap peas and eggplant . The vegetables were all cooked perfect and were buttery . Chopped raw tomatoes on top cut the richness .

We shared huckleberry tart for dessert it had pastry cream and less huckleberries than I was expecting but it was good , soon we were ready for the check but they bring us out these tiny BAKED chocolate mousse that tasted light as chocolate air .

A sweet ending!
