YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g I came for lunch while I was in Mandalay Bay for a conference.  I had an arugula salad ($16) with mushroom and farro as well as their BLT with fries instead of the salad. The salad had a balsamic vinaigrette that was very light.  They messed up on my order and gave the side salad anyway but came with the fries in addition. The fries are AMAZING! I almost never finish my French fries and never care to order them but these ones had a great texture and flavor. The BLT was just okay. It comes with jalapeno bacon, butter lettuce, beef steak tomatoes and chipotle aioli for $16. It had a star next to it which means it's one of Hubert Keller's favorite dishes.  Their is "patio" dining which is still indoors in the hotel but is exposed compared to the inner portion of the restaurant.
