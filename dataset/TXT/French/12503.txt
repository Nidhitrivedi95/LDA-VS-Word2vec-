4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Totally unexpected  -  had a great breakfast here outside, overlooking the strip.

Service very good; interior decor unexpectedly large and awesome; food was *great* - they really nailed it, in fact.  One of the best renditions of French Onion Soup I've ever tasted anywhere, and the coffee was Intelligentsia (also Chicago - just like Lettuce Entertain You that owns Mon Ami Gabi) - which is unexpectedly great coffee in the center of The Strip.

Prices are *extremely* reasonable given the location.

Re: the other reviews - Yes, I love the fancy steakhouses too - this doesn't try to be them - but the food is well-executed and head and shoulders above Denny's or IHOP. :)  No, nobody is going to confuse this with actually being in Paris...

Really looking forward to going back for Dinner on my next trip.
