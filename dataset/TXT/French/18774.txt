AHosGBveeXx9YjsQvdJgeg Wonderful experience for lunch. Classy and friendly wait staff. The open face ribeye sandwich was perfection on a plate. Buttery garlic toast topped with arugula and tomato, well seasoned ribeye and melted cheese.  The Parmesan herb fries were the perfect compliment to the dish.
