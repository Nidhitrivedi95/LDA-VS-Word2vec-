rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Amazingly, it's been a couple of years since my last visit here. Since were staying on the Palazzo/Venetion premises, sort of tired of Grand Lux, and too lazy to drive off-Strip... it was time for Bouchon!

We strolled in and were seated promptly, ready to order since we were starving. My wife picked the quiche, while I went straight for the chicken and waffles that a lot of my Yelp friends were raving about. The waiter asked if we wanted a mimosa, and I blurted out yes. I don't usually order and drink mimosas, so I'm not sure what happened.

I was probably just in the moment during brunch. At any rate, the mimosa was good -- as it better be at $12.50 a glass. The complimentary baguette was as hard as a rock, and even the waiter was scratching his head over why many people loved the baguette. Any food that cuts my lip and/or gums just isn't a good sign.

My chicken and waffles arrived, and the chicken just looked uber juicy and tender from the outside. I could only imagine the inside. It didn't disappoint. Well seasoned, full of flavor, and wafting with aromas, I licked every bone squeaky clean. I had no shame in picking up the chicken with my bare hands and eating it finger lickin' style.

The waffles were okay to me. I was kind of disappointed the exterior wasn't as crispy. But it was the accompanying whipped butter and syrup that really amplified the waffles. I had a bite of the quiche and that was good as well. Overall, a bit of a splurge but a nice brunch.
