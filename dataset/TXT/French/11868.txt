The check in process is goofy with folks without resos clogging the line for those with resos.  But, the desk is usually efficient.  The prices are in line. The food is consistently good. Patio seating is highly coveted and hard to secure. Only disappointment is that they took the salted caramel ice cream off the dessert menu so I couldn't request it with the Bananas Foster Crepes (which still rock with the usual ice cream).
