COgwFthJpS4We16W5Gf4lw Had dinner the other night at Pamplemousse La Restaurant.  The meal started with a vegetable basket (Crudités) a good size basket with an assortment of cut vegetables and a dipping sauce of vinaigrette.  The next course was Le Foie Gras "Au Torchon" a wonderful fresh duck liver basted and served with red wine jelly and orange marmalade with toasted brioche triangles.  The next course was a different version of escargots--this was more of a home style, prepared with the traditional garlic and shallots but in a brown earthy gravy--possibly madeira infused--and mushrooms.  This was very hearty and delicious, a definite change to the normal butter presentation.  The next course was delicate scallops with a beautiful beurre blanc and parsley sauce--very rich and appealing.   My main course was the filet of baby wild boar--very nicely prepared, served with a black currant brown sauce and accompanied with asparagus spears and roasted potatoes.  The meat was done perfectly, extremely moist and tender.  I opted for a traditional crème brulee for dessert--very smooth, creamy with the candied glazed topping.  Overall, this meal was very pleasant and enjoyable.  The waiter was Pierre and really tried to cater to my tastes.
