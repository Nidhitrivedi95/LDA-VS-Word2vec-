or4UVDjXEEjze3wNPjoAZA Um, I really expected better. I came here for lunch today and I got the shaved grilled chicken salad based on our server's recommendation. He stated it was a popular salad so I went for it. I was not impressed. It was practically a Caesar Salad that tasted like nothing. With tip, I ended up paying $20!! $20 for a tasteless salad.

Maybe if I ordered other items off the menu other than the salads, I would be happy...
