_cjPEH9wXhKS-HQe_U3M4Q Strange location for this place as its' tucked right behind King West but it certainly didn't detour diners as I found myself behind 3 other groups on a busy sunny Sunday Morning waiting for a spot outside in their patio. This place is a French Bistro and the décor screams it which I like as it is very bright and clean inside. 

It's French fare so be warned that the dishes are typically very very HEAVY...you could find yourself going back home and crawling back to bed after brunch here. A lot of poached eggs options and their croissants are fresh baked. I tried the Croque Madame (difference between monsieur is this has an egg on top, I learn something new every day). It was delicious, HEAVY, but delicious that came with a side of frites. The ambience is busy but also very relaxing and I find the servers to be fairly attentive. My only criticism is the time it took to get our food, it was literally a 30 min wait since we placed our orders. But that won't deter me from going back but will certainly learn to order a basket of fresh croissants to start with next time.
