bRmb81XDG3E2SOHARBLTog Went to Bodega last week for brunch and thought it was average at best.  For a pricey downtown bistro, the service here is lagging behind its competitors. One person in our group had to send his food back because it was cold. That's fine, mistakes happen, but the waiter acted like he would rather be at the dentist's office than tending to our table. Hopefully he was just having a rough morning but it was off-putting all the same, especially considering what we paid for our meal. I ordered Eggs Benny which wasn't bad but also nothing to write home about. If you're looking for Eggs Benny that will truly knock your socks off, stop by Carens in Yorkville or Amore in midtown.
