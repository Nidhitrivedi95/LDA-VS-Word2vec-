Sadly...I had to. 

I was in awe with the beautiful abundance of baked goods along with a wide selection of pastries I have never seen before! I bought way too much for my drive back to DC. Macarons, Croissants, sandwiches, etc. All perfect! 

Tucked away on Butler street, this pastry shop shines above the rest and ensures quality over quantity!
