aervNtqzrKf0CGrFo4xfKw On Saturday, my husband planned a date night. The intention was to go somewhere on the west end of the city but with all the weekend events, we decided to take our business east. The area La Papillion is located in is just lovely and quiet. 
We made our reservations on OpenTable. But was running late, so I called ahead to let them know. It was no problem. There is free parking lot off to the side of the building and there's lots of space. The entrance is cozy. Once you walk in, the restaurant is huge. They divided it in sections with a waiting lounge area and different dining sections. The walls are decorated with painting by local artists. The hostess immediately sat us. We weren't sitting more than 5 mins. Just looking around and observing our surroundings when a waiter approached us and was apologetic that no one has took our drink orders... But we didn't even have a chance to look at the menu. It was very nice of him to check on us tho. He made a few suggestions and our order was in.

The food...
We ordered the escargots to start. We got 6 pieces in a garlic butter. It was very good. For entrees  I had the peppercorn steak - medium rare. It was very tasty. The peppercorn was not overpowering and gave it a nutty crunch. This was delicious! 
Dave got the Pork. His was cooked to perfection. I believe there was a fruit condiment go eat it with. 
The portions are moderate. For us it was fine and we didn't feel stuffed after. But for someone with a big appetite, the portion might not be enough. 

We really enjoyed our dinner. The timing for when items come out of the kitchen is perfect. We didn't feel rushed, and got to enjoy our time out. 
For all these reasons, I would go again.

There is a beautiful patio upstairs. It was a chilly night so we were in the formal dining but I would go for their brunch menu one weekend soon.
