bzbNGyrTwWHAgg1CqkSgeg This place was really nice and had a fun vibe,but the service was horrible. Im sure everyone was hungover but wow it was horrible. I would def come here for food though. I had the soup and Cesar salad and was very happy. They also had red velvet waffles which was mind blowing. 
I would def come here again
