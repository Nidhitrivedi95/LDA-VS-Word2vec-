Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA I don't know what the other reviewers are smoking, but this place was a horrible.  All style, no substance.  If price were not taken into account, I would give this place slightly below 3 stars for the quality of food.  But for the thermospheric prices ($50/entree), I had expected excellent, if not indelibly memorable food.  Instead, the food was just adequate.  So I knocked off 2 stars because of the poor price/quality ratio.

Not everything about this place was bad.  The dining room was very nicely done.  It definitely had the trendy Vegas/LA see/be seen thing going on.  The waiters were also very helpful.  Ours knew the intricacies of every dish and spoke like a food critic, using words like "acidity" and "overtones".  We got excited just listening to him talk about the dishes.

But then the food came.  The first course was actually decent.  I ordered the prawns appetizer, which had excellent crustacean flavor, but not quite worth the $28.  My girlfriend had the gnocchi, which was good, but again, not spectacular.  For the entree, I ordered the bison.  Again, a decent piece of meat, but nothing memorable.  The peppercorn crust was far too heavy, which made me think that the chef was trying to mask the dull flavor of the underlying meat.  My girlfriend had the lobster au curry ($58), which is supposedly one of Alain Ducasse's signature dishes.  The lobster was cooked perfectly, but the sauce did nothing to enhance the flavor of the lobster, which left the dish tasting limp.  

While we were pretending to enjoy our entrees, the waiter came by to remind us that both were written up in magazines (Bon Apetit I think he said).  As if suggestion was going to make the entrees taste better.  Had the dishes verged on greatness, we might have been convinced.  But that was clearly not the case.
