YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g Wow. What an amazing meal! I was very excited because of chef Hubert's  reputation (plus occasional top chef appearance), and while some yelp reviews made me a little nervous, I was very pleased with the over all meal. While portion sizes are small, they are all very shareable which is great.

For four of us, we ordered 11 dishes (two never arrived- oh well). The onion soup shooter was amazing!!!!! Also, I really enjoyed the meatballs, short ribs and chocolate soufflé! 

Oh, and start off the meal with the sangria. Definitely the best sangria I've ever had!
