3jKUbhGSjFTv5jZ0wnW0xA This place is really very good. Thanks, Yelpers. It actually wasn't our first choice, but while other restaurants could not accommodate our largish party on short notice, Les Deux Gamins could and we're glad for it.

We were able to make a reasonable dent in the not-too-large menu of bistro faves.

Duck ravioli was nicely done, served in a brown butter sauce. The  house salad was fresh and generous.

Fish of the day was Mahi-Mahi;  the whole fish lightly grilled and served with rice. Almost an Asian take on the dish. Very very good, we left nothing but bones. 

Onion soup was a fine rendition, although probably best to share as it is too rich for one.

Warm chèvre and walnut salad with honey was simple, but outstanding. Needed nothing more

Lamb shank in Whiskey BBQ sauce was tender, tasty and presented very well. Again, nothing left but the bone.

Crème brûlée for dessert was perfect;  custard at the perfect consistency with a think, crisp brûlée layer on top.

Service was remarkably efficient, particularly considering how few staff there were. Our server did double-duty in the kitchen; I saw here there with a blowtorch finishing a crème brûlée.

We will definitively be back the next time we are in town.

Go.
