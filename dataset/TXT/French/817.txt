_cjPEH9wXhKS-HQe_U3M4Q Always a happening place. I've frequented a lot over the years and I am always happy with the ambiance. It is a little piece of Paris bistro! 

I find that the food is generally good. It's really rich but then again, I can easily just fill up on that amazing bread they serve.

Not too crazy about their daily specials but who cares when you have a croque monsieur that's smothered in cheese?
