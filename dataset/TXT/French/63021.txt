SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA One of the BEST pork dishes I've ever had.

The Pork Two Ways is fantastic.  The pork shank is set up and braised overnight for over ten hours, and the results are outstanding.  Savoury, impeccably tender, this pork shank made me take notice on the very first bite.

The pork belly adds a great textural contrast, with the crisp skin overlying more tender fattiness below.  One might find the pork belly quite intensely salty on its own, but it pairs up beautifully with the pickled red onion on the side.

An un-advertised but superbly delicious part of the dish was the panko-covered deep fried cauliflower.  Everything about this side was balanced, without any sense of over-breading or greasiness and letting the cauliflower just taste amazing.

The frisee and bacon lardons with poached egg salad was a nice way to start, although be prepared for a vinegar and mustard dressing that definitely leans more on the heavily acid side of things, but will balance nicely with the fattiness of the lardons and egg yolk.

The only disappointment was that pear and almond tart was served to me partially burnt and quite dry throughout, but they quickly offered to replace my dessert without hesitation.  Too bad the caramel ice cream was so good that I had already polished that off first and was too full for a second dessert by then.  Next time!
