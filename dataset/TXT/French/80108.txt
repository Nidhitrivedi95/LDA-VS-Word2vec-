zw4Legbcu018p5WcZ74iWA Absolutely delicious!!!. Not being a big fan of poutine my husband and I visited montreal for our anniversary and of course had to have a poutine in Montreal. We went here after reading the reviews and were definitely glad we did!! The staff is very friendly and the poutine is amazing! Will definitely be going back next time we are in Montreal. The place is lined up out the door. And that definitely says something when you can get poutine basically anywhere in Montreal.
