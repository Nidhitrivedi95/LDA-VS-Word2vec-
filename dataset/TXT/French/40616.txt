KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA I am so happy we reserved a spot with a lake view. Everything was quite exquisite and the service was very good. 
It was a Thursday night - and quiet and cozy. Perfect for a romantic date. 

My husband and I ordered: 

Lobster bisque  
Yellowtail carpaccio - the lemon cream and shaved fennels add a unique profile to the food. 

Pan seared Iberico pork loin - perfectly cooked! It was so tender and juicy. 

Bistro chicken - probably the best chicken I have had in years. Crispy savory skin (not over salted, not over fried) with a hint of zest and tasty herbs, served on a bed of roasted veggies. 

Whipped potatoes - creamy and tasty! No flour used... you can taste it :)

Bread pudding ... oh my... European style: not sweet and wet enough to combine with ice cold vanilla ice cream....

With a side of Chianti ...

 It was the perfect night!
