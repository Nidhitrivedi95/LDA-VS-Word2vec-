rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A My friend and I were staying at The Venetian and so we decided to go to Bouchon for dinner. We ordered and split the Bouchon steak with fries as well as the trout. The trout was the standout dish of the night. There was so much flavor infused into the fish as well as the accompanying asparagus. The Bouchon steak was overpriced and nothing to rave about. It was cold when it came out. Also, we decided to upgrade our fries to the truffle fries and that was an additional $11 cost. I would have expected the hostess at a restaurant at The Venetian to be a bit more warm and welcoming, but she seemed more aloof. We probably won't be back anytime soon.
