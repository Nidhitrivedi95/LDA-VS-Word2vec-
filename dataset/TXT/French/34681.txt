Let that sink in for a minute. That was the "appetizer" I chose from the lunch prix fixe menu, and that huge pastry could easily have been the whole meal. I went to Comme Ca on black Friday when I found the Wicked Spoon buffet cram packed full of people. Oh, happy day!

The lunch menu is a wonderful bargain. I spent far less than I would have at the (admittedly fabulous) buffet, but I was certainly as full as I would have been if I had gorged myself with unlimited servings. My choices: Duck confit cinnamon roll (as previously mentioned), the croque madame sandwich (out of this world), and the creme brulee for dessert. I've heard the profiteroles are also outstanding, so I must go back to try them.

At least for the lunch prix fixe, I can say that the food is a bargain and the view is unparalleled. Definitely a lunch destination on the Las Vegas strip!
