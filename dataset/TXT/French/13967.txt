50-xiTYmE6NERi-yJ6NvHw Second time here and as usual, the food was delicious. We primarily came for the buck a shuck oysters, which has a countdown from 700, but we wonder about the actual legitimacy of the countdown as we had 72 oysters but the numbers on the board didn't seem to reflect that. 

In any case, the other reason we were there was to celebrate a friend's birthday. Sadly, just like the first time I was at Biff's, despite a clear conversation with the hostess/server about doing something for the birthday boy/girl, and assuring me they would put a candle in the dessert and write happy birthday, this did not happen - TWICE!!! This was super frustrating and the server clearly had no recollection of this at all even though we had even made sure he knew who the birthday boy was at the table. 

So as long as you aren't there for a birthday (although there were a few around me that were successes), go there for the oysters and other fabulous French cuisine. I got the 3 course meal since I don't eat raw oysters which did not disappoint - especially the chicken liver parfait. Mmmm. Also, the service is on the slow side so don't go if you are in a rush!
