This is now one of my favorite cafes in the world! I enjoyed absolutely everything in there: food, music, ambience, service, and every little detail. The place has that European charm that I miss so much in America. That evening on April 23 when my wife and I celebrated our anniversary there, was exactly like those we had in Berlin. There were lots of people chatting, drinking, and laughing, lots of sounds and smells (we could see and hear how food was prepared), and music was just perfect (I wonder what it was). I love it when it's loud and crowdy in cafes. That's how it should be.

I especially want to thank the staff for not coming and asking "Is everything ok?" when I am in the middle of chewing. I really hate it when waiters do it here, in the US. Also, I can't thank enough the person who made Bolinhos de Bacalhau for us. They were like crunchy salty heaven! It was the best appetizer we've ever tried!
