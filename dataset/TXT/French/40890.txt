The menu is a little bit of a hodgepodge of styles, which usually makes me cringe, but every dish was executed to perfection.   The presentation of the entrees was beautiful and every element of each dish tasted good.   I wish I could pick this place up and move it to Los Angeles so I could eat there more often.
