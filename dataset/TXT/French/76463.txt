Yp9w4nhUowBU_IS_StFXbQ This restaurant was a little hard to find but it's a nice restaurant right next to the pool inside the Wynn hotel. The decor was really nice and I enjoyed the calmness this restaurant offered, especially after a night of partying.

I had a glass of fresh queezed watermelon juice that was refreshing, but I wish it was a bit colder. I ordered the eggs benedict which were delicious. My only complaint about the dish is that the muffins were toasted so much that it was difficult to cut. I also ordered a half order of the white chocolate and peach pancakes for my friends and I to share. They were really good. Nice and light and sweet. Yum! My friends ordered the dungeoness crab club, elk sauage and eggs, and a fruit platter. We got to try each other's dishes and they were all delicious! I liked how fresh, light, and healthy the crab club tasted. 

We also ordered the soufle for desert and it was good. I like my soufle a bit more bitter and warmer but it was still pretty good.

Overall this place is a great spot for brunch and definitely worth the little extra money compared to other alternatives.
