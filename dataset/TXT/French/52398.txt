q0n4I-zqiI47xispOqc1lA So we wanted to get brunch and my friend thought that this would be a good idea. 

The service sucked so horrible that it made us lose our appetite.  The waiter asked us if we were ready to order (we weren't) and sighed. We had just gotten seated and already we were feeling unwanted.  Once we ordered we waited for what seemed like ages, it was actually 40 minutes, and he never came over to tell us where our food was, if we wanted more water, to apologize for the wait, anything.  The people who came after us (smaller party) got their food before us.  

My friends and I  were furious, we were going to just get up and leave and then he finally brought our food (no explanation either). We didn't even order anything particularly extravagant.  My friends both ordered savory crepes and I ordered the White Salad.  It was good, but way too much chicken.  My friends both said that the food was so creamy and rich that it made them sick.  

TLDR: I would never go back, not even for big portions.
