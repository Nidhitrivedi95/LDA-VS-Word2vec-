4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw HUGE disappointment. My friends and I came here with a big party for a birthday dinner. The restaurant was dark and classy looking, a cool atmosphere that we def were looking for. Unfortunately, if we had known the service was going to be so freakin slow or that the food was going to taste like the whole salt shaker had been dropped into it, I'm pretty sure we would've opted for another restaurant. 

I shared the pasta and French onion soup with a friend. I didn't think the pasta was that salty but my friend kept insisting it was. But when the French onion soup came, I tasted the salt. AND BOY WAS IT SALTY. I couldn't really eat it alone since it was too salty so I tried eating it with the bread that the restaurant served. Even that was still too much. I basically ended up stuffing myself with just the bread and butter that night. Oh, and water, of course. 

After our half-eaten food was taken from us, I think our table waited a good 30min-1hr waiting for our check. Yes, I understand it takes awhile to split a big group's check, but it shouldn't take a waiter that long to even come to our table and start the annoying process of splitting and making sure who got what. We had places to be and waiting at our table for that long put us all in a grumpy mood. 

I really hope the service isn't that slow for smaller tables. Even if the service had been faster, I prob wouldn't come back since I don't need that much salt in one meal.
