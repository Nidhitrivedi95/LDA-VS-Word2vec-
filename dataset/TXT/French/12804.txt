4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw This was our third visit to this location. We had a great waitress who worked her magic turning a mediocre meal into a better one. We are locals, which means we have many options for eating lunch both on the strip and off. We are members of Lettuce Entertain You and get a huge discount at their Vegas locations but even so, must at least have a good reason to drive to the strip. When we eat here, ambience is a huge factor. It becomes a staycation. So what was the issue? I ordered Trout Almondine and while it tasted good, it looked sparse, had a few scattered almonds on top of a lightly sauted fish, and unlike most I have had. For $23, I would expect a few more veggies and maybe a potato. Our wonderful waitress offered to bring an extra side dish of mashed cauliflower which smoothed over my disappointment. 

We were also celebrating my birthday early, so she brought out a nice cream puff ice cream. 

The rest of the meal was good. Hubby ordered a hamburger with fries but waited and waited on his mustard. Again, our waitress saved the day by bringing more mustard and ketchup. 

Will I rush back? Not so sure with so many options in this town.
