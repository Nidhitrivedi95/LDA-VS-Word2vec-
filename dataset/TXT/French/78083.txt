YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g This should be a five star review but I allowed my friend and fellow Yelper Seth(the food snob) to talk me down to 4 stars. The service here is stellar and they really pay attention to detail. The huge gripe I have with the service is that they neglected to tell us each soda would be charged as such. This would've been ok if each one had more than 3 sips in it and didn't get refilled when it was halfway done.

Other than my small gripe and my friends slightly overcooked Sea Bass the meal was fantastic. I must admit the meal started off great when we were greeted by the deceptively cute hostess and brought to a very private table. I'll excuse the fact that she called my friend my other half but that's a story for another day.

We ordered the 4 course elegance menu which started with tuna tartare on top of a fennel slaw which was refreshing and a great starter. Next up was a chorizzo wrapped Chilean Sea Bass with risotto with a tomato sauce that was amazing. My bass was cooked perfectly and basically melted in my mouth. The presentation was colorful and made the dish pop. Next out was the filet mignon and potato gratin. The filet was buttery and the perfect portion.

And then there was dessert.....wow was there dessert. I ordered the chocolate fondant cake with peanut butter milkshake and peanut butter ice cream. My friend ordered the carrot cake with carrot/pineapple ice cream. I am not a fan of carrot cake but the ice cream was intense. My fondant cake was exactly like you'd hope a gooey, warm, angel would be. Wait....no, that's it. A great way to end an elegant meal even if my company was a snobby Yelper. I will definitely be coming back. Thanks Hubert!
