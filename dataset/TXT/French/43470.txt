LXKvgY1vqtMvKj8DvCpkzw While getting a haircut at V's barbershop, my husband found this (newly opened this September) wonderful French restaurant...He was so excited to surprise me. We both loved our first experience...great waiter named Chris welcomed us and the food & presentation were all wonderful. Two beautiful patios with great ambience that open to the inside as well  Holidays are coming...Great gift idea...
