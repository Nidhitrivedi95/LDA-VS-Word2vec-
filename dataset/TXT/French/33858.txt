hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA Fantastic little gem. Don't be dissuaded that it's located in an office park. This place has an amazing menu and they use local and organic ingredients when possible. The quality of the food is top notch and delicious. 

The owner, Olivier, is fantastic. He is very friendly and makes sure to greet everyone warmly. He is extremely knowledgable about French cuisine and takes time to explain the menu to newcomers. 

Our only lament is the location. We wish it was closer to Green Valley! My wife and I (and our dogs) would come several times a week if it were closer to home!
