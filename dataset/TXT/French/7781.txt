4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I'm in love with this place! Food is touristy yet wonderful! I love the view of the Bellagio fountains. I went for brunch and had an eggs benedict. Magnifique! My girlfriend had crepes and they were great too! I can't wait to come back for dinner next time I'm in Vegas!
P.S. There are TONS of very over-priced "fancy" restaurants in Vegas where the food ends up sucking. Mon Ami Gabi is expensive without being absurd and the food is A+. Give this place a try and make a reservation in advance!
