Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA PLEASE NOTE - this review applies to their New Years Eve experience only.

Food was wonderful, service was excellent (with one big exception explained later), but the whole reason we went to Mix, and paid their higher price on New Years Eve, was the view which was a HUGE disappointment.  I would not recommend Mix for New Years Eve.  Any other night I would say it is a great choice.

First the good.  The 5 course tasting meal was phenomenal.  We didn't just like all the courses, we loved them, and all were simply fantastic.  The opening veggie martin with truffle topping was one of the best appetizers I have tasted.  The wine pairing will also very nice, and our waiter was fantastic during the whole meal service.  It was also a very fun and festive atmosphere.

Now for the bad.  The whole reason we chose Mix, and paid the higher price, was to see the fireworks from their vantage point.  The problem was, we had no view at all.  The only people that had a view were the few tables that opted for outside seating.  The restaurants does NOT overlook the strip, and thus if you pressed your face to the window on one side, you could barely see two of the hotel fireworks.  The view is from the Mix Lounge, however that was closed, and restaurant patrons could not enter.  The other disappointing fact, was our waiter, who was so friendly and attentive, and throughout the whole meal, assured us just before the fireworks he would show us the good spot to stand.  The only problem was, after 11:30, he disappeared, and never reappeared.  There was no good spot, and this seemed in retrospect to have been just a con to get an increased tip.

Mix is a fabulous restaurant, and I would highly recommend it, but avoid it in New Year's Eve.  It is a waste of time.
