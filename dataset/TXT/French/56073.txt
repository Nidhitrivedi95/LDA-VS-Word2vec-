rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A one of my favorite breakfast/brunch spots in Vegas. I usually sit outside, and it is beautiful & comfortable when it is not too hot in Vegas.  Not the best of best, but you will enjoy their good food at beautiful Venezia hotel(Venezia is my favorite, most sophisticated building among other Venetian towers).  It is a great place for breakfast/brunch to start your day in Vegas.
