xaqW4NkmUCGRRjmLxiFJ6Q Great place! The staff was super friendly and welcoming. It was yummy and easy to eat. I had a Philly cheese steak which was amazing but I would have enjoyed it more if the onions were caramelized or fried. The sugar cane juice was also a great recommendation. Everything is a bit pricey for what you get and the place is a little hidden but it was a good experience and I hope they will open more locations.
