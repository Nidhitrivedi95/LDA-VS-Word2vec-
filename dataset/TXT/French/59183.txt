rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w My husband and I dined here and did not check out any reviews before hand. I was wearing wedges and a dress coat and he wore a dark v-neck, jeans, and flip flops. While we were waiting to be seated, (make a reservation) we watched a couple be turned away because he was wearing shorts. So make sure you dress up a little. We were nervous about my husband's flip flops but we were seated without a remark. The restaurant has a partial view of the Bellagio Fountains which is so great to watch while you dine. 
Our waiter was extremely attentive and professional. He didn't bother us by coming by too often and didn't ignore us the whole night. It was the perfect combination. The bartender has makes a great cocktail and is timely. The restaurant is an intimate size and is very upscale. The food was delicious! I ordered the sea bass and the heirloom tomato salad. Both were VERY delicious. My husband ordered the chicken and the cherry almond app. He also thought they were delicious. For dessert we ordered the creme brûlée and the chocolate soufflé. The soufflé was divine and the creme brûlée was a tad generic with out a wow factor. Overall the service, ambiance, and food was just perfect.
