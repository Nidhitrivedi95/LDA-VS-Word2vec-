rBOpDqeQl0J_fbDtY-cWxg Cute restaurant, warm atmosphere.  Great service. Our waiter was named David, he was very professional and gave his recommendations.  Large variety to choose from on the menu, along with the specials of the day. I had the mussels in a cream sauce.  Flavour was good but sauce was very watery. I followed with the salmon which was delicious served with roast potatoes and mixed vegetables. A glass of chardonny completed the meal.
