The most pleasant part of this restaurant was the hostess's greeting at the door. She was very friendly and welcoming. Something I always expect from any restaurant, but it's one of those things that's hard to perfect. 

Let's discuss about the food. The special of the day "Scallop salads" was ok. I would not give more than 3/5 for this dish. Although the overall taste was good, the salad was over dressed, and the scallop had little too much salt on the surface. Entree? I ordered braised beef short ribs with balsamic glaze. It sounded tasty, but again, little excessive on salt, and it tastes nothing special. Worse than that, I don't think it matches the price and all the raves they've been getting.

The dessert menu needs to be re-worked. Maybe they can incorporate fresh seasonal fruits or something. As of now, it looks terrible.

Waitress's service was on the slow side, but nonetheless, very pleasant. She could recommend me a decent glass of wine to go with my dish. And oh yeah, the atmosphere was pretty nice. I loved the decor, and while it's not pretentious, it somehow induces the right amount of intimate feeling. So, if their cooking skills and the menu improves, this place could easily be a repeater.
