4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw We decided to check out this restaurant because a.) It got good reviews on here and b.) They offer a (meager) gluten free selection. While my food wasn't bad per sey, I could imagine having had a better omelet at Denny's. My bf's gluten free eggs Benedict was also seemingly sub-par in the flavor department. 

Even taking into account the taste discrepancies between regular and gluten free items, I didn't feel like this breakfast lived up to the hype. 

I could however imagine their dinner fare is a bit better - the green beans that came with my omelet were the best part of the meal :)

Service was excellent - friendly and efficient.
