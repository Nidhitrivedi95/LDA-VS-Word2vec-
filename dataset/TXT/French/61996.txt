The food was phenomenal. We had the mussels in this delicious cream
Sauce that we wanted to lick from the bowel. The ahi tuna was delicious and a lighter options for an entree. The mahi mahi was delicious, the sauce is superb and made the dish. The bread pudding was huge and delicious. We also had the cheesecake with lavendar in the crust-- superb. The wine list is different with wines from Austria and Slovenia as well as France and Italy. Our server was superb. No complaints! A must go! Perfect before a show at the Gammage.
