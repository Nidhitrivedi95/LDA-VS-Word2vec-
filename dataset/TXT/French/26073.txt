d482l58ho0_IMdFkXX1F5Q I was really looking forward to this meal. I was sadly disappointed. I love his other restaurants! DB bistro in Miami was my favorite. I was hoping to get his foie burger but they didn't have it here. I tried the escargot, French onion soup, foie and duck app, hamachi app, halibut and the frenchie burger. Unfortunately most of the dishes lacked real flavor. I was so disappointed the escargot had absolutely no flavor. So strange. The soup and hamachi was tasty. 

I would recommend saving your Daniel Boulud experience and try it in NY or Miami. Hopefully in a few more months this Vegas location will on point.
