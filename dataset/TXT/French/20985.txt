AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw I saw a huge crepe station inside this quaint, posh patisserie so I had to get in line. Mmmmm they looked so good! Once I got to the register, they told me the wait would be about 30 mins! I couldn't wait that long, so I picked up an apple danish. It was really light and the pastry was flaky. Delish! The ambiance of the place was impressive and grand like everything else in Ceaser's. The line moves fast for the drinks and food but the wait for crepes will be long! 

I was determined to have a crepe from here, so the next morning I returned, only to find out that the wait was 40 minutes. =( I settled for a large iced white mocha, which was satisfying anyway. I grabbed one for my friend too and the total came out to $15. Wowzers.
