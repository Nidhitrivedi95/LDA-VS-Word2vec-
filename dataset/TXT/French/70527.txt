xaqW4NkmUCGRRjmLxiFJ6Q Quiet disappointed in this place. With all the high reviews I would have expected more.

I ordered the berry world crepe. It was flat in appearance. Didn't look how a crepe was supposed to be. Why put it in a cone when it's basically a crepe pizza??

 Taste was good, but if you add Nutella to anything it would be good no matter what.

I would not come back again. Disappointed considering the raving reviews
