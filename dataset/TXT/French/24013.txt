Ok, so I've been recommending APCD to anyone that'll listen to me without having being able to go myself.  For the most part, everyone's thanked me for it.

Sooo finally I managed to make it, and it was all I hoped it'd be.

Unpretentious yummy meaty food.

Even though everyone favours the Lamb Shank, I had to go with duck margret, just because it is one of my favourite meats.

As much as I wanted to add a piece of foie gras to the poutine, I couldn't do it.  I only wanted a mild heart attack, not a massive stroke.

The bread.. oh geeze.. I consumed several loafs, and was just completely content with taking it and dipping it in the duck sauce (Barbara Streisand).

All in all.. Yum.
