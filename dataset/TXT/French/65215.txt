u-SvRRAfYgpbXZRfQgcTzA The ramen at this place should be the standard for all ramen in Montreal. I had the spicy ramen which was so creamy and rich that the broth alone could be a soup on its own. Also, do try the green tea cheesecake! Very creamy and that added touch of salt makes me wonder why aren't all desserts salted. 

The staff are very energetic. No surprise for a place that is trendy and young. The place is very loud and perfect for a night out with buddies and friends.

This place is very busy so if you want to eat at this place I'd recommend to reserve especially if it's going to be a big group. 

Sayoonara!
