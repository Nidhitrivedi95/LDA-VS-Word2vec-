0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g Wow.... just wow.  Picasso is a restaurant that just oozes class.

The best part is that the food and customer service are outstanding to match.

Picasso isn't your everyday restaurant, as suggested by its prime waterfront location in the gorgeous Bellagio resort.  The authentic, multi-million-dollar Picasso artworks adorning the walls are another giveaway that you're about to experience something spectacular at Chef Julian Serrano's flagship restaurant.

I visited Bellagio on a Saturday evening, armed with 5:30pm reservations.  The hostess was incredibly gracious and gave me a window seat overlooking the lake.  Perfect for front-row viewing of the half-hourly fountain shows.  The clientele skewed toward a very specific demographic -- mostly older Asian businessmen on dates with their (much, much younger) girlfriends or trophy wives.  I didn't really fit in, but I didn't let that faze me any.  After flipping through the encyclopaedic wine list and settling on a glass of Sauvignon blanc, I was all set.

There are several menus to choose from, including vegetarian and 4-course prix fixe menus. However, I decided that "go big or go home" would be my motto for the weekend, so I opted for the 5-course degustation.  This includes an amuse bouche at the start of the meal and petit fours at the end, so it's really a 7-course extravaganza.  Absolutely everything about my dining experience was phenomenal, and I'm still reminiscing over it with fondness:

**AMUSE BOUCHE**
A shot of slivered almond soup with a pheasant croquette.  The soup was silky smooth, which contrasted nicely with the slivered almonds.  The pheasant croquette was crispy and light.  Both were packed with flavor.

**COURSE 1**
Maine lobster salad with apple-champagne vinaigrette.  Very fresh and complex.  Loved the addition of cantaloupe spheres.

**COURSE 2**
Pan-seared U-10 dayboat scallop with potato mousseline and jus de veau.  Imagine the most perfectly cooked scallop you've ever had, sitting on the silkiest, smoothest, creamiest, and most decadent mashed potatoes you've ever come across.  That's *almost* as good as this dish was.

**COURSE 3**
Sauteed steak of foie gras with toasted pisatachios and poached cherries.  Rich, luxurious, and amazingly cooked.  If you're feeling indulgent, you have to try this.

**COURSE 4**
Sauteed filet of halibut with asparagus and Hollandaise.  This was probably the most traditional and straightforward dish of the night, but it was executed flawlessly.  Loved every flavor about it.

**COURSE 5**
Pears poached in chai tea with panna cotta and chai tea ice cream.  The perfect ending.  A strong chai flavor connected all the elements.  Loved how the warm pears intermingled with the cold ice cream and perfectly textured panna cotta.

**PETIT FOURS**
A tray of delectable handmade candies that included chocolates, jellies, truffles, and meringue.  Every single one was to die for.

After dinner was over and the check was paid, I felt so blissful that it was struggle to get up and leave.  But that's okay, because Picasso gives you a little something to go!  In my case, it was a gorgeous gift box with two individually wrapped mini muffins -- perfect for a breakfast snack the next morning.

Service is incredibly professional and gracious, with a whole team of servers tending to my table.  However, it was my server, Mitch, who really shined that day, making sure that every course was perfectly paced, every water glass was full, and every crumb was swept away between courses.  Another amazing surprise was receiving an email a few days later (from the general manager, Kelly M.) thanking me for my patronage.  I'm so blown away by a restaurant that cares so much about its guests.

What a night!  I don't know when I'll be back to Picasso, but I hope it's really soon.
