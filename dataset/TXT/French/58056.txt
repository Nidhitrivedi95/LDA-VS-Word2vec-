rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Like many, I really wanted to eat at a Thomas Keller restaurant, so we came for brunch. On the Bouchon website, you can try to make a reservation for breakfast/brunch and it will tell you that there's nothing available. Don't fret -- they just don't take reservations for breakfast. We waited about five minutes at 1pm on a Sunday (but a generally slow Vegas weekend). Another thing to watch for: there were sample treats in the waiting area!

I had the croque madame, and it was really good. And yes, the fries were the bomb. My boyfriend had the sourdough waffles, and no joke, they really melt in your mouth. Everything was great, even the butter was distinctively delicious. Best of all, it was reasonably priced AND we walked away with leftovers.
