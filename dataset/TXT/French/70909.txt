xBxDMEkFK5GBhiy-8gGE9w I hated the tight squeeze of this place. It's small and annoying. The width of this place is like 8 feet, and the menu is boring. I did not enjoy my experience. It's too small to accommodate groups, or even small parties of 2 people.

I would no bother considering this place.
