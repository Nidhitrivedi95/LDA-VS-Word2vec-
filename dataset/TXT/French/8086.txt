4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Excellent breakfast spot, and great people watching on the strip from the patio. The patio is constantly packed, so expect a wait. Eggs Benedict are as good as I've ever had. Muffins are made in house, and grilled, so they have a nice crunch. Hollandaise is perfect, not too thick, and not runny. So good, I came back for a second day in a row!
