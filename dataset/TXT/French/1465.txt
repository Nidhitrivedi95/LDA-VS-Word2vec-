Went to Scaramouche to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday. I got the Lobsterlicious prix fixe meal, while he got the Quebec Duck as a starter and the Elk as the entree. The dishes were delicious and we especially enjoyed the foie gras that was part of the Quebec Duck dish. For an additional $5, we were able to "upgrade" the dessert (included as part of the prix fixe menu) to the coconut cream pie. Scaramouche's coconut cream pie was heavenly, with just the right balance of coconut, custard, and cream. The shaved white chocolate on top was DIVINE.

I must mention that our waiter, upon hearing me mention that it was my boyfriend's birthday, went out of his way to ask the kitchen to add a special "Happy Birthday" message on the edge of the dessert plate. The coconut cream pie was served with the birthday message, which was written using chocolate sauce, along with a lit up birthday candle. Simply AMAZING service - the small gesture made us feel very special and well taken care of.
