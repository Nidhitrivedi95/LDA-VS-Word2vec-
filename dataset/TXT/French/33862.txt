hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA I was looking for a new cafe to try and I gotta say, this was definitely worth it. I tried their quiche and and the spindrift sparkling orange mango. Their meat quiche was really good. It was very soft and the crust was not hard either. The flavor was just right - not overwhelming or too rich. You have the option of adding a side of salad. I was also very impressed with their excellent customer service. Prices are reasonable and the outside seating is awesome. It looks like you're in your own backyard. Oh, and the soap in their restroom smells really good, lol. Try this place!
