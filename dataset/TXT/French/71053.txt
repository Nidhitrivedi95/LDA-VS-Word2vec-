xcmmTXhuMx2fZF2Bt69F4w Mussels with red curry sauce were out of this world. Tender and clean and tasty. I personally make some good mussels-  but these were better. Really astoundingly good. 
There was a 40 minute wait for a table on a Sunday night. But the evening was great for a stroll around the neighborhood and then a drink. So the wait time went by quickly.   Pork special was subtle but good. Gnocchi was delicious. Linguini with shrimp - OK but nothing great.  This truly a local treasure.
