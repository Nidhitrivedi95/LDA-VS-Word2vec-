mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q If you can only make it here once, This place is a once in a lifetime dining experience! the best restaurant I have ever eaten at. The executive chef is the highest rated ever four Michelin star! The head chef is a winner of chopped. The amuse Bouche is fois gras with Parmesan foam. This is only the beginning! I have posted the menu and pictures before but don't see them and will be updating this soon to show the glorious foods and delights you can find at this most prestigious of fine dining establishments. Next door is the namesake restaurant and although it was good this place is much better!
