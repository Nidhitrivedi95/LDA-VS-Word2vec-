LQ_gYNs5E10IGFE0NOyD7A The type of place that will **sigh** under there breath if you don't order an alcohol beverage with your meal. 

Had "the Upton" for Sunday brunch and it was delicious. I will say the restaurant does care more about the plate presentation than the food; an example.. I had to ask for gravy on the side since both biscuits came dry, unlike the ham that was covered. 

TL;DR. Probably won't come here again unless I'm stuck directly on Shoeman again, too much you'll miss in Scottsdale for a ho-hum place like this.
