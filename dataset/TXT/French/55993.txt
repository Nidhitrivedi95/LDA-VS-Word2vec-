rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A This place is phenomenal! We went there for brunch and enjoyed the food along with the ambience. I will definitely be returning to Bouchon on my future trips to Vegas.

We ate the following items:
Waffles topped with Strawberries and Pecans - delicate texture with a light crisp on the outside.
Croque Madame - WOWZA! Best I've ever had. The brioche toast was fantastic, the egg was cooked perfectly and the sauce was delectable.
French Fries - crispy and flavorful.
Croissant with Apricot jam - best croissant ever and the jam was just perfect!
