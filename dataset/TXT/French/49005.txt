OkC86YtZ0Nm19my5F4GGrQ Sunday is a great night to go to Tartine, a charming French bistro in downtown Rocky River (no I didn't need a passport).  It isn't as crowded (they don't take reservations) and they have a 3 for $25 special--appetizer or salad, entree, pizza or tartine, and dessert.  The wine selection is nice and we started with a reasonably priced Aime Cabernet Franc and had a lighter fruity Oregon Pinot Noir with the entrees.  We sampled Baked Brie with a flaky crust and dried fruits, a salad with cashews, fruits and goat cheese, peppers stuffed with andouille sausage, yummy sea bass with tomatoes ,asparagus and a delectable lemony Beurre Blanc, the duck confit tartine, and for dessert, Lemon Creme Brulee and bread pudding.   I would only note that the portions are smaller than the usual restaurant portions...which is probably why French women are so elegant and thin...
