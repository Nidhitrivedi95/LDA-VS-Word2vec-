This was one of the most amazing dining experiences I've ever been through. 
The restaurant was spacious and the staff was extremely attentive.
Every dish served had amazing thought and creativity behind it.  Both surprising your taste buds and rewarding it at the same time. 

Can't say enough for the bread cart (I'm a bread lover :D ) and the cute dessert cart in the end.

Got the tasting menu, and just when I think they are done with the dishes being brought out, I was informed I was only half way through.

Truffle risotto was my handsdown favorite!!!

The only downside is the length of dinner, we took about 5 hours for the 4 of us since there was just so much to eat!!
