WOd8tWsh2Yt_osHv-ngx_w This was a nice little brunch spot we hit up on a Saturday morning in October. The patio was enclosed at this point since it's cold out but they still let us bring our bulldog in and gave him a bowl of water under the table. The service was quick and friendly and portions very large and filling. Eggs Benedict with Smoked Salmon was good but I've certainly had much better at brunch spots back home. My wife got a strawberry crepe with English cream and she seemed to enjoy it. Overall, solid spot for brunch and we did not wait long at all for a table, but nothing I would go out of my way to recommend or go back to next time I'm in town.
