HojKatUfX4UHWaPqtl63NQ The experience from start to finish was amazing. The elevator ride up was awesome although I am scared of heights. We were dining for a friends engagement. Walking to the restaurant the the view was amazing me and my bf both got lobster dishes. They were both great we just wish there was more. The staff was amazing are glasses were never half full. The decor was flawless which makes that a plus too
