QeFsIMcIFIJcOrpthYL8jg I found Modavie on a few different travel sites with excellent reviews so we had to try it - and it exceeded our expectations. It is located near the port where all the main shops and lively streets are. We were greeted at the door by Lorenzo. Lorenzo was the kindest person and made sure our service was nothing but perfection from the moment we walked in until the moment we left! The waitress we had too was very excited about the food, answered our many questions about the different meals and was always attentive. We had French onion soup to start which was delicious. Our main meals were the rack of lamb, duck confit, and mushroom risotto. It was all so beautifully presented and very tasty! They also have Jazz nights every night of the week, sometimes on their second floor and other times on the main floor. Even though we didn't sit where the jazz was that night, we could still hear the performance and it added to the experience. Overall the place is beautiful, the food was excellent, and best of all, the service was perfect. This is a MUST in Montreal!
