hzyvL2v97xLzLbLXcdi1uw Came in on a Sunday with my girlfriend for brunch. Wait time was not terrible, about 25 minutes. 

The place has a nice ambiance, but it seems understaffed. It took the server about 15 minutes just to get us water. 

I got the Nutella hot chocolate which was delicious. It was not too sweet and had a nice hint of nutella. 

We split 3 dishes between the two of us. The Marseille crepe was nice and the side salad was good. The French Walnut Street French toast was a bit heavy for both of our tastes and extremely savory. We did not like it that much. The Super Belgium sweet crepe was also very savory. I did not like it that much, but my girlfriend liked it. 

If you do not have a sweet tooth, I would recommend to keep to the savory crepes.

When we left, nobody greeted us out.  Nobody took my money, so we just left the money on the table and left. I thought this was slightly unprofessional and rude. Like I said, they seem understaffed.
