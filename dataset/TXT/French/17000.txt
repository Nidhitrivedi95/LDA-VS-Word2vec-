I came here for their prix-fixe brunch ($38 for 2 courses, includes tea, coffee, and juice). I got the crispy duck egg and smoked salmon eggs benedict, both of which were excellently prepared. The portions are also fairly generous.

Unfortunately, it's the subpar service that really holds this place back. Upon arriving, none of the 3 hostesses present acknowledged us until we inquired about our reservation after several minutes of silently being ignored. Service was also on the slow side, and we had to ask the busboy to fetch our server to order. Once he did appear, he was surly and standoffish, doing the bare minimum without ever engaging us in the meal. 

I really want to like this place - the new Four Seasons building, along with the great modern decor and food all have the makings of a great restaurant, but the service really was a letdown for a place of this calibre.
