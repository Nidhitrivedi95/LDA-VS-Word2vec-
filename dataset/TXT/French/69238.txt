We were overwhelmed by the number of different pastries and had trouble choosng just one to share (we'd just had a very filling dinner). One of the girls behind the counter was extremely patient and helpful as we tried to choose.

We ended up with Le croustillant aux 3 chocolats and enjoyed it a lot! The chocolate was rich and delicious, and the presentation was great. The outdoor seating was a great place to enjoy dessert on a warm evening. 

Unfortunately, the price here is not something a college student can afford daily, but I'll definitely remember this place for a treat in the future.
