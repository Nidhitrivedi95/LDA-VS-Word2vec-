QEgfK_TKY8bwK-YzKDdkGw Very much enjoyed the dining experience that we had here at this French restaurant. Ingredients are fresh, well-prepared, and high-quality.  Flavors are rich, balanced (not too heavy), and decadent, if you appreciate classical and artful impressions. Ambience is intimate and modern. This is an all time Charlotte fav.
