t1mR_Zff6Dqv1TueE2JLEA Sultan's Tent does a great job of captivating with its decor and whimsy. It seems like you're going somewhere special when you walk in and the service certainly lives up to that high standard. But then again, mood, decor and service can only take you so far. 
I had some excellent dishes as well as some disappointing ones. The bastilla and rack of lamb were absolutely superb. The Moroccan cigars were good enough but not authentic - though I do realize this is meant to be French-inspired Moroccan. Some of the other lamb dishes  I tried were not particularly good.

I would go back again, but recommend to err on the side of the more elaborate (read pricey) dishes. They certainly were good.
