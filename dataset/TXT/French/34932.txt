I actually ordered the lambshank and it was literally fall off the bone.  It was also a HUGE portion. I got the steak tartare appetizer as well and although it was tasty, it was REALLY lemony. Luckily I love excess lemon and sour so I enjoyed it.  They even came with pickled onions and pickles and other pickled root veggies and that was really tasty but I must warn you that it's also very lemony.. to the point that it burned my lips because I guess they had cracked a little from the wind. 

Either way, if you want a nice restaurant in a beautiful hotel with a gorgeous view, definitely come by here and enjoy a meal.
