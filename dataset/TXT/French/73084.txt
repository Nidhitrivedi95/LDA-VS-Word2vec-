XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q I wavered between 3-4 stars and finally settled on 3 based on the overall experience. When you are spending at least $700/ couple on a meal, I expect absolute perfection and there were some flaws. 

I called a few days prior because I was told that if you are eating there, a house car would come get you from your hotel. When I called before hand they had agreed. Then when I called that day, she said no the house car was full. Why I was not told to reserve beforehand when I called just a few days ahead? First flaw. 

To start, the server had the bartender come over and answer some questions to help my husband decide on a drink. Unfortunately the bartender was not very helpful and seemed a little snobby to us and as if he was annoyed to be answering questions. When my husband switched to the wine, he decided just to order without a recommendation.  

Regarding the food- Some dishes were absolutely amazing and the presentation was out of this world. The bread cart was great but I thought it odd they only want up the first round then may serve it cold. For this price, shouldn't every piece be warm? 
While most dishes were great, 2 dishes came outline warm which was not amazing. Specifically the potato purée which Joel is known for. It was barely warm, dare I almost say room temperature. The dessert (specifically the one that came in an orb) was beautiful and delicious and the tray of smaller desserts was an amazing finisher. 

Our server was generally good until the end when we needed to leave and he hadn't been by in awhile. Understand I am being more critical because for the price and the fact it is a 3 star restaurant. We have been to a few 1/2 star restaurants that cost less and were better so that is why I chose 3 stars.
