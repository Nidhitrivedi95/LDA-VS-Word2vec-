The food itself was very good. Even though I had high expectations (tartare is not the kind of meal I go to "cheap and cheerful" places for) I was very happy with what I got. For $40 the degustation plate had 5 different combinations of meat + preparation style pre-picked. It included 50grams (each) of veal, duck, beef, salmon, and tuna. I also got a side of matchstick fries, which were very good.

The reason why I have to give it just 3 stars is the service. Our waitress basically ignored us the entire night. We never got our water replaced, we were never asked if we wanted another drink, and after waiting to get the bill for about 15mins, we had to flag another waitress down to get it. The venue is very night, and obviously going for a more up-market look/feel, and I would expect the service to match.

I will probably give them another chance. If you go, I hope you have a better experience than I did.
