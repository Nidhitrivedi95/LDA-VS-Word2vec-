4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw This was from back in Dec. 2012
Actually I would give it a 3.5 ha! It was quite good everything except my entree, boohoo! It might not be their fault either, I tried to go with something different for me, being in a French restaurant and all...So I tried some pork chops with fig, but maybe it was fine and I just don't know how it's supposed to taste.... I didn't really like it, I didn't like the texture of the pork chops, too soft and it was too much on the sweet side for me...

Now, the bread....oh the bread...that takes 5 stars right away, enough said.
and the little salad that comes with the bread...delicious!

The place was packed, but it wasn't too bad the wait because it was freaking cold outside and we brave the cold and accepted a table outside. If you kept your jacket on you were fine.

They have big space heaters all over the place, there was one right behind my chair, so it was actually perfect. 

Nice experience overall!
