The place is small if you're looking to dine, and they don't do reservations. However, the bar is always happy to serve drinks while you're waiting. The people in the restaurant are nice, and the bar is the place to have friendly banter with people.

The food itself is good, but not amazing, given the more expensive price. If you're a fan of frites (fancy fries), get the truffle frites. It comes with a couple gourmet sauces that make it an appetizer worth getting. The burgers are good and hearty. The salads are fresh. 

Overall, I would probably come back if someone brought it up, but it's not my go to.
