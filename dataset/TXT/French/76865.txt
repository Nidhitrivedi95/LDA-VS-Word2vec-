ysJo5Jdo29XOBCnKrbUKWg Actually 3.5 stars. We ordered the Paris 66 steak salad, the Paris 66 buckwheat crepe, and the filet mignon with frites for main entrees. All of the food tasted good. The banana crepe and the creme brûlée for dessert tasted very good. Food was served promptly. When the waitresss dropped another customer's credit card in our food, she apologized and soon brought out a new dish. I enjoyed the French and cat decor.
