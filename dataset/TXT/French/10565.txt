We attempted to dine here on our last day in Vegas, but were intercepted by the rudest hostess I had the displeasure of dealing with.

My Beau wanted to have a nice lunch with me before we left, and specifically selected Mon Ami Gabi for it's view of the Bellagio Fountains. We approached the hostess stand, and asked to be seated at a table for two on the patio. It was 3:45, yet the hostess grabbed two dinner menu's. When we inquired as to when they stopped serving lunch, we were told that dinner began at 4. The hostess, a napoleon complexed girl who was evidently severely jaded about her job, proceeded to lead us outside past a dozen empty tables to one far out of the way around the side... with a view of the facade of the building. Perfect. 

We asked if we could be seated at a table nearer the front of the patio, as we had wanted to catch the Bellagio Fountains before we left. She scowled, looked around, and said that was all she had. A basic 'screw you all, I will seat you where I want'. Again, we politely pointed out that there were many empty tables scattered throughout the patio, many of which were in the desirable location of the front. Nope. She was having none of it, and basically said that the table she was offering us near the emergency exit in the very far end/back of the patio was the only place we were welcome to dine. 

Enough of that, we decided at that point that dining there was not worth any amount of 'service' she or the waitstaff could provide. We left, without so much as sitting down. 

So perhaps the food at Mon Ami Gabi is decent, or even great... However due to a profusely incompetent hostess I did not have the opportunity to give this restaurant a chance.
