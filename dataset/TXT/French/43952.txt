m9aFZk1f8tSv248YErbpQA My wife and I came here for our anniversary breakfast. It was very good. Unusual, in that the fillings (banana, strawberry and nutella) were put on tops instead of inside. But, it tasted great none the less. The service was good, the atmosphere was nice and quaint and relaxing. I've tried some other creperies in the valley and this place is by far my favorite.
