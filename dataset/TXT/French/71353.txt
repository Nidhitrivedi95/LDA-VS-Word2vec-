So I came here to check out the restaurant for the very first time. It's in a nice and quiet neighborhood. Very chill and relaxing. The restaurant is known for their mussels, but I actually took my husband here for their veggie options lol. 

My hubz ordered the veggie burger and he was happy. He said that the veggie burger was flavorful and you can actually see veggie pieces in the burger. We shared the Brugge frites! Yummy! The frites was delicious with the basil mayonnaise. We pretty much inhaled the frites. I ordered the Point Burger. It's alright. I asked for medium well, but it turned out well so the burger tasted a little burnt. Oh well...
