uP3H5bcsiTXM0k0xQhRndg This food was delicious. The service was fantastic. This was a true home cooked meal in the middle of Old Montreal. I have been in Montreal for 3 nights and this was by far the best meal of the trip. Price was a little on the high side but definitely worth every penny. I highly recommend this restaurant. There is not a single bad thing to say.
