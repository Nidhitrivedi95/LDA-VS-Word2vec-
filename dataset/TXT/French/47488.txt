O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q Went here several times but just haven't had the time to write a review. This place is one of my favorite restaurants on the strip. The service is such a great and personable experience. Have had the pleasure to have Santino as our server and love it each time we get him. 

The food is amazing and the drinks are incredibly tasty and indulging. They created a tropical type of Moscow Mule that was just out of this world when we went a few weeks back. It has now made it on the main drink menu and I strongly recommend it.

Have not had a bad meal, app or desert there yet. Hope that whomever reads this enjoys this underrated gem as much as we have!
