nWW6fBfBljiRFa4sG7TyxA Review is for HAPPY HOUR! :)
We decided to do a happy hour, after researching we picked The Black Pig. We are very pleased that we did! $3-$4-$5 menu is awesome! We ordered the Frittes, Pate Melt, Cuban, and Pork Belly. The best things were definitely the sandwiches. Both were $3 for a half...and i would easily eat 2 whole Pate Melts. They were utterly delicious. The pork belly was a little too fatty, but still very tasty is really enjoyed the hash that accompanied it. The frittes were, well, frittes, can't say they were anything special if compared to neighbors. All in all with several drinks we walked out of there under $40. and we were very satisfied with everything. We will be back for sure maybe try some entrees, but they Happy Hour one of the best Ive seen.
