1cGyzWtfOoDiE8V0OR85yA The setting is nice and staff is pleasant, but the crepes and coffee are average at best. Ingredients were too simple and not very flavorful. It had the feel of a fast food crepe restaurant with a lack of attention to food quality.

The restaurant is also cash only which is inconvenient and likely deters business. You will get far better crepes at restaurants such as Cafe Moulin or Square Cafe.
