ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug This place really deserves no star. We ordered a seafood soup and a steak. The soup tasted like some instant crap, the seafood ingredients were nowhere near fresh. The steak was bland and tasteless. The steamed grenn beans were raw. No amount of A-1 sauce could've saved this joke they called a steak. The table next to us was also complaining about their food too. The service was non-exisisting. It took us 10 minutes to send the steak back. People, do not waste your money on this shitty place.
