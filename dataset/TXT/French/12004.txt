4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Two Las Vegas regulars recommended this place to my friends and I when we asked for a cute place to have lunch where we could sit outside.  Well, we put our name on the list to sit outside and the wait wasn't that long... but when we go to the table, boy oh boy, were we outside!  Smack in the Las Vegas heat and sun.  Strangely every other table was under an umbrella, except ours.  We couldn't do it.  So we asked to be moved inside.  Luckily, they had an indoor patio, which was still nice.  They were very accommodating, our server was a sweet lady.  She took excellent care of us!   We of course started with a pitcher of FRANgria!  You got that right... Frangria!  It was interesting... had a hint of Rosemary.  And they serve you a loaf of fresh warm french bread for the table.  So good!  We ordered the Brie as an appetizer, that was AMAZING!  Our lunch itself, it was okay.  The Kale salad I got, nothing spectacular, but it wasn't bad.   And the server was so sweet, she heard I was celebrating my bday so she brought out a little cream puff with a candle and had everyone sing for me.  Totally special and sweet!  The location of the restaurant is so nice, right on the strip across the street from the Bellagio fountains.  Right after lunch, we all stood outside and took a selfie in front of the "Eiffel Tower!"  Our little trip to Paris... on a budget of course!!!
