Yes, you can believe all the hype surrounding the macarons is true! 

Tonight, one of my really good galpals and I had dinner here right after classes ended at 6pm. Not too long after we parked and got off the car, she commented that she could already smell all the goodness seeping through the front door. 

This neat bakery is hard to miss at night. Located across the boca park complex, the bakery flashes 'pastry. bakery. bistro' in bright neon red, visible along Charleston. Parking is plenty and location is pretty much around the center of the town and highly accessible. 

We caught sight of the desserts early (who could overlook the colorful macarons?) on but walked over to the menu first thing to 'build our own sandwich', say baguette, turkey, lettuce, tomato, pesto and swiss cheese. The staff were really nice and even handed us a piece of 'prosciutto' when we asked what it was. While that was being made, we headed to get our sweet treats. Per Christina W.'s suggestion, I got the ginger macarons, and getting curious herself, my friend got one too along with chocolate pistachio & coffee. To my delight, they were all très délicieux! Fluffy and chewy! Seeing as we came from a long day at school, we treated ourselves to some meringues too - vanilla and coffee to be precise. The sandwich costed us about $9, but was enough for 4 people. We had so much left over that to-go was our only option. 

At the end of the night, we thought that perhaps trying some new restaurants for our next hang out would be a good idea, but an even better one would be to stay in touch with sambalatte and manon so that we could go over their whole menu one day!
