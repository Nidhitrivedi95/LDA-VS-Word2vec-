rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w We did my aunts birthday dinner, considering it being 5 star restaurant, their service was crappy. My aunt turned 90, you know it's a big one, we made a reservation and asked for the special cake(of course we verified the price and everything) they couldn't find a damn cake for a while. I saw a hostess writing it down, "party of 10 with chocolate bday cake" when we got there, she asked us back, "oh did it write it down? Oh we are sorry, we can't find it right now" what the hell. It was frustrating, they could find the cake for a while. And then the waiter spilt water on my uncle. To top it off, there's no garnish or anything on your food, if you order piece of meat, that's all you are gonna get. And my aunt, she loves lamb, that's why we picked here and we confirmed before that they had lamb, but on her birthday, when we got there, they said there was no lamb that day, it's seasonal item. Again, it's her 90th birthday, how often does that come? That was the whole point, lamb and the cake for her. They really need to do something about their service. We spent more than a grand in there, and they almost ruined my aunts birthday. God what a disaster.
