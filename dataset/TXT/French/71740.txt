xeFVRUjxorxjO_qjX8FNdw This is a fabulous restaurant and is much more roomy now that it has been renovated.  I am not sure why it does not have a higher Yelp review.  The food here is always fresh and tasty, and the staff are always friendly and accommodating. We have been coming here for years, and it never disappoints. My mom and I came here for dinner and both really enjoyed our dinners. We both had the lobster bisque as a starter. It was rich and full of lobster flavour. My mom had the chicken tarragon crepe, which is always fabulous; and I had the crepe special: beef with sugar snap peas, mushrooms and sun-dried tomatoes in a rose sauce. It was delicious!  The chef always manages to put together combinations that are unusual but super tasty!
