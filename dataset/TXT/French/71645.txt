XcWlBj5oQgzKhR7Cxovj3w Go here for over-priced bad food with a side of attitude. I love the Zinc Bistro at Scottsdale Quarter but the airport location is pretty bad. 

I ordered my steak frites medium but it came out practically raw. It was such a fatty piece of meat, I could barely cut it. I asked our waiter for two steak knives and he said, "We're at an airport." Well, that makes sense but there are more polite ways to respond, such as, "Unfortunately, I can't give any steak knives because we're at the airport and sharp knives aren't allowed." We told him the steak was not a very good cut and he just stared at us blankly.

Over-dressed salad. Boring fries (which is crazy because their fries are DELISH at the Quarter). Even the burger was bland and dry. 

Would I recommend Zinc? Yes! At Scottsdale Quarter. There are better options at Phoenix Sky Harbor, though.
