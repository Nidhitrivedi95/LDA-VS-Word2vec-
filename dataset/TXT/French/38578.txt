jLxeBgWhLRbII2ACkgH1Sg I'd never been to French bistro before and this place has definitely made an impression on me. Had the Salmon Brioche topped with this amazing little ball of cheese. and it was amazing. The desserts in the case were all so tempting, so making a decision to feed my sugar craving was difficult since everything looked so good. This could become a regular lunch spot.
