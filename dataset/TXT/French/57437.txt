rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A 4 very starving girls travel upstairs from their suite to Bouchon - boy, I am so glad we did. On a busy Sunday morning, we only wait 10 minutes before we are seated.

The baguette, butter and apricot jelly served before your meal is heaven. For brunch, I shared the Omelette du Jour with a side of Frites with my gf; we could not stop munching away at the Frites. A third girl had the Croque Madame, which was her personal heaven, and a fourth girl had the Moules au Safran et à la Moutarde, which yes, believe it or not, was heaven, too. Everything was savory, sweet, satisfying and so good!

In addition to the memorable cuisine, we had an extremely personable waiter. Customer service makes all the difference. He was attentive, friendly, accommodating and didn't mind joking around with us. 

Should you be pondering if you ought to try this bistro, I say do it, don't think about it. The ambiance, the staff and the food promise to satisfy.
