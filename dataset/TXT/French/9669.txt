4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I decided to go to Mon Ami Gabi for my birthday with a party of 13.  I chose it was because it is moderately priced and I love French food.  I have to say I was quite pleased, there were a few snags but overall it was a good experience. 

The food was fantastic.  The escargot was great, very garlicky but I love garlic so I was fine with it!  My filet was cooked to medium rare perfection and was one of the best steaks I've had in a long time.  (Much better than the steak I had at N9NE) The wine we selected was fantastic, so good we ordered a second bottle.  The bananas fosters crepe was huge and my husband and I could not finish it.....it was that big! 

Overall I think it's a great dining experience on the strip if you want a good meal for your money.  W did have a large party and I found MAG to be as accommodating as possible, even seating us even though the whole party wasn't present.  While our server was attentive however, my husband received his steak au poivre, not what he ordered, but still great all the same.
