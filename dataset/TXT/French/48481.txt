ohMpNug5zWNxOlL6ShG7Ig A Sunday afternoon gave us a chaotic Cafe Bink, but excellent food.  They were almost empty inside and still had a couple of tables open outside, but were very vocal about the sudden unexpected rush(?).  All three staff seemed be in crisis mode, simultaneously helping all tables but not coordinating with each other so things got missed.  Thank goodness the chef wasn't pulled into waiting tables too, because the food was excellent, excellent, excellent.  Very good.  We were looking for a place to linger on a Sunday afternoon, so we saw the two hours our meal took as a good thing.  I think, if the kitchen staff could arrange for some anti-anxiety meds for the rest of the staff, Cafe Bink could be something really special.
