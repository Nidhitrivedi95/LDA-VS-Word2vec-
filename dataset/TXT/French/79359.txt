zIyqiWYKrCvAdGeWXXBxFw My boyfriend and I have dined here multiple times due to its excellent service and atmosphere, we always return every year. Our first encounter was for Summerlicious where the portions of food are definitely larger than any other restaurants I've been to for Summerlicious. We have tried the food on their regular menu and the portions are even greater and just as delicious! 

We tried their Summerlicious menu again this year and it did not disappoint. The presentation, taste and service were all amazing. The Grilled Calamari is always cooked to perfection, not too tough. This year, I ordered the Grilled Sous-vide Veal Chop - a very generous portion and it was so tender and moist. For dessert, my boyfriend absolutely loves their Scandinavia Vanilla Bourbon Crème Bruleé which is super creamy with the harden sugary coat on top.
