xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g My husband and I treated ourselves to a special date night here, and we were extremely impressed.  

Service: 5 stars
The service was excellent from the moment we checked in. The hostesses, server, and wait staff were all extremely friendly and courteous!  

View/Ambiance: 5 stars
The view is amazing.  We even got a seat right next to the window directly in front of the Bellagio and a view of the Strip.  You can't beat that!  It's a very romantic place. In fact, one couple beside us got engaged right while we were dining and the one on the other side had just gotten engaged earlier that day!

Food:  4 1/2 stars 
The food was good, too.  The starter was the fennel mousseline, which was surprisingly interesting and good as we'd both never had a mousseline before.  We both started with the Market Greens salad, which was very good. The dressing was really amazing!  My husband opted for the halibut upon the recommendation of the server.  He enjoyed it so much that I didn't get to taste it.  I went with the filet mignon, which I requested to be cooked medium, although we both thought it was slightly overdone (more like medium-well with only a slight hint of pink in the center).  We also ordered the Asparagus with Brown Butter.  I found this to be only okay.  We each finished with the pistachio souffle, which was perfectly light, fluffy and enjoyable.    

Overall, our experience was great. This is an excellent spot for a special occasion or a romantic night out in Vegas.
