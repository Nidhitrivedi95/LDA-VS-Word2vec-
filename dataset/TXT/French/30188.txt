FRuuIDOd21pTJHvEGIt1Gg Great atmosphere, friendly staff, hot french canadian chicks littering the joint, and most of all, great food.

I wish I had something funny to say about this place, but I was pretty buzzed.  The foie gras on gingerbread was super good though - which is all I can remember.

Would I eat here again, absolutely.
