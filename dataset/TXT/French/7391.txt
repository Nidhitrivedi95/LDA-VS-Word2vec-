4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I don't get the hype on this place. The service was terrible, the food not that great, the view was blocked by pedestrians and trees. For the price, I expected better service and better food. Go to Ellis Island Casino & Brewery Cafe, where the food is good and cheap and the service was really great.
