1cRvhC7shC6UneMqRYm4yg I & my sis had a meal of a glass of wine each and a good variety of appetizers. In a word Yum! The food was impeccable - delicious. On the pricey side, nothing I'd do often but a great outing, especially for an earlier evening. It fills up and the service diminishes as the clock ticks away. Luckily, we had an early meal.

Just a note: everyone uses the word tapas to describe small plates (usually savory) eatz - to me tapas connotes Spanish or at least Latin in flavor.
