KcW_eVY0T0NSwlbXqUrRuw Me and my family shared 3 plates. Delicious! The rice was great and the ribs were amazing. The portion are huge. It is like fine dining food in the atmosphere of a food court. Not cheap but worth it....$12 to 24 bucks
 Owner was very personable and everyone was extremely friendly.
