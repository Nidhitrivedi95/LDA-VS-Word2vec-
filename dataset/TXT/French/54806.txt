rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw One of my friends made reservations at 6 pm for 11 persons to celebrate 2 of our friends' birthday on Saturday: 3/6/2016. Located in Aria hotel and near the buffet, this place, foods, and customer service were great. The food was cooked to perfection and everyone enjoyed their food. I had the pork chops and it melts in your mouth. I had sampled a little bit of my friends food. It was great. It was too hard to choice which one is the best. I was too full to finish my pork chops but had to because some of my friends and I had to go to a show right after. I didn't want to carry any left over food around and leave it in the car to spoil. I would recommend.
