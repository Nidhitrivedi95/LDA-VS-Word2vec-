jT-KFrbwr5iE-_vrVLpmiw This place is clean and looks upscale. There is a wide variety of middle-eastern foods. The main entrees are set out beautifully on artsy/hipster manners. 

However, I echo Jennifer K's review about the furniture. The chairs and tables are uncomfortable. The chairs are either too high/low for the table. All of my friends complained about this and it negatively impacted our dining experience.

One other thing, the service is really spotty. The food is served slowly and the servers (I can tell they make an effort) seem really disorganized. 

This place has potential, but just needs to improve first.
