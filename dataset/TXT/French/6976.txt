4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Called for reservations around 730pm for 830pm reservations and the ladies up front were perfect.  When we got there they were just as lovely.  We had to wait 5 minutes so we ordered some cocktails from the bartender who was a professional. Ordered a well whiskey(Early Times) for myself and some sangria type drink for the wife which was nice ($25 for both).  After sitting at a table that I was not that happy with our first server, in the most sincere way, moved us to a nice spot in the lounge. Billy took over from there in the lounge.  Throughout our meal we were treated to exceptional service.  

We immediately ordered a pate which, we had 2 to choose from.  The house pate with mustard and toast ($13) was the perfect start to the meal. Oh yeah, and dont forget the baguette with butter. I ordered an old fashioned for myself which was nice and a lemon drop for the wife(not sure of quality but she pounded it sooo....)

Then we had the endive, rouqefort salad which had a nice balance of walnuts, cheese and spinach($13).  There was also some carrot salad, pickeled capers and tiny cucumbers(?) that were nice to snack on between courses. Finally we ordered the ribeye with pureed cauliflower and mashed potatoes($40), perfect with a glass of red wine.

Wish I had room for the creme brulee because it looked amazing on the table next to me but it just couldn't have happened this time.

I'm a tough critic and rarely give 5 stars but yes, it is worth the big bill if you want to treat yourselves.  Good luck, I hope you enjoy yourselves as much as we did.
