Sr-DO1Nt8X4I4Pjxapwz-g Great food, inexpensive, laid bank atmosphere...I'm not usually one for anyplace called "bistro" LOL but I'm glad I took the chance!

I had the grown up grilled cheese and twisted Mac n cheese, my wife had a southwest salad. We had apple/berry pie and rice pudding. Delicious! And under $20
