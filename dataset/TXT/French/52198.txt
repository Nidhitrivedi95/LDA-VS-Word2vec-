I have experienced Chez Nanou and La Kitchenette...magnifique! BOTH venues are nearly identical to one another and I hope both provide "un petit peu" of a true French dining experience!

I have only enjoyed brunch in my two visits...and dinner is going to happen someday. SOON I HOPE! It must! However, brunch is scrumptious. Whether Johnson Brothers Coffee (JBC), a cappucino, or tea, it's all brewed , crafted, and steeped wonderfully and tastes marvelously. I dined on apple french toast and a special vegetarian mushroom combination quiche in my visits. I had a friend come along the second visit who devoured an anchovie and black olive quiche, and they RAVED! The food easily deserves all 5 stars! Simple, but divine! I easily would have dined on a second serving of the mushroom quiche.

Staff service is perfect as well! Weekend brunches are sparsely attended, so you have an intimate dining experience as most tables seat 2-3, and some 4. I should dine solo sometime, as I could easily see myself sitting for a while, sipping on a coffee, dining, and reading my book...ah 'la perfection'! In my second visit, our host took extremely good care of us, made sure we always had enough water and coffee in our glasses and cups, and was keen enough to tantalize my guest and I with a dessert suggestion. Considering it was Bastille "weekend", we savored three tasty macaroons, humorously referred to as "Macrons", in the French flag colors. 

Prices are also reasonable for brunch. $9-14ish per plate will see me returning soon! Not many of my friends enjoy such carefully crafted food experiences, and so many people are not aware of LK, but La Kitchenette is an establishment I highly, highly recommend!

Allons-y!
