KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA We came here for brunch. The atmosphere was beautiful & very charming with the view of the lake and a garden decor. We were given freshly baked bread with creamy whipped butter. It was perfect. The mussels were perfectly cooked & the best thus far. I had the lobster croissant with salad. It was delicious & we portioned. My husband loved his ham & egg sandwich. I knocked off one star because my seat was wobbly & the cushion cover was stained.
