BS0GcQ1kUag8YJ2qcBH2lQ Oh, what the hell. After two or three more visits since I wrote my original review, it's time to bump up the rating to a perfect five. Caren's not only has great food at reasonable prices (I've enjoyed every single dish I've had there -- including yesterday's creamy garlic soup for lunch), it has the most romantic patio in the city. It's a perfect date place. Gentlemen, take my word for it. You can thank me later.
