_eNeiqWPt1MPLFF6DEIJeA Unfortunately I only have bad things to say. Starting with the lime gin fizz I had, it was all really poor. My friend got the steamed buns and deconstructed tuna maki. The tuna was served cold, not meaning raw, meaning very cold temperature which was a turn off because sushi grade tuna should be served at room temperature in a restaurant. It was also chopped? Or maybe it went through a meat grinder? Whatever the case, the consistency of the tuna was gross. She said that her shrimp in the steamed bun was hard. Her rice was also over cooked in the maki. I got fried rice. I didnt think you could mess up fried rice but it is very possible. They have different spice levels you can get choose from, so I asked our waitress if the Korean hot hot was really HOT and she said no. I have a pretty high tolerance for heat so I got the "hot hot". The hot hot was bbq sauce smeared all over fried rice. She told me that it is intended to be a spicy bbq sauce. Had I known that, spicy or not, I would never want bbq sauce on my fried rice. We both usually suck it up and eat our food, but I really didn't want to eat my food for the sake of eating it. For fried rice and the drink it was $20 of untouched food and drink. She comped my friend's meal but said she couldn't comp 2 even though only two bites were taken.  She offered us a dessert but no one had eaten dinner... We walked straight to barrio. Their manager walked past us twice and never stopped over, I thought that was a bit odd for a place that just opened or a restaurant in general to not have superior customer service.
