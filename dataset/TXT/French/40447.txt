KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA I can only give 3 stars unfortunately because even though the food here is amazing, the service is kind of hit and miss, the owners only talk to people they obviously know which I will expand on and the kitchen lacks attention to detail and properly preparing dishes.

This is our second visit and the food is truly amazing when prepared as stated on the menu.  I ordered a Chopped Cobb salad and I had to inform the server once she de used to come by again that there were ingredients the menu stated came on the salad and they were not there.  Bacon is a component of the salad and there was NONE.  This baffles me, a simple Chopped salad and the kitchen forgets ingredients?  It makes me wonder what is really going on in the kitchen.  Is there not anyone checking the food before it leaves the kitchen?

The table right next to us had two ladies with a baby, one of the owners came by and said hi to them, she obviously knew them and the walked away...never said hi to us or asked if everything was ok, nothing.  As an owner you should take pride in your place and check on the people helping you make a living.  

I covered the food issues and the owner issue now the service.  Our server took a long time to come to our table just to say hi for the first time.  She was really nice but would disappear and not come back for long periods.  When she brought my salad, fist off she should have noticed that it missing and most places of this caliber normally ask if you would like pepper with the salad but not here today.

Overall the food was good just a few items if fixed would make this place a 4 to 5 star place.
