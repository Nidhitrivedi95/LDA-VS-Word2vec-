rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Had brunch here with the family and loved the service, ambiance and the food plus we had a very knowledgeable server.

We had:
1. Breakfast plate with bacon, sausage, eggs, pastry and toast
2. Croissants
3. Oatmeal
4. Coffee, OJ
Everything was delicious and well prepared. My only disappointment was that the croissants were not as good as we hoped. They were good but not amazing and for this type of restaurant we were hoping for better than average.

Overall would definitely recommend.

Update 1/22/14: We recently went to Bouchon in Yountville (their flagship) and I found out that in all the other Bouchon locations outside of Napa Valley, the baked goods are made with a machine (hence my disappointment at the croissants). Everything in Yountville is handmade and you can taste the difference.
