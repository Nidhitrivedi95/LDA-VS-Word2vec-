O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q Usually love this place. Was here for dinner during the CES convention and was not impressed. First off, we asked for bread as service was slow three times and each time we asked, we were told it was coming. Finally, after 30 minutes, we got bread. The biggest disappointment, however is when our main dishes arrived at the table. We were a party of four and all of us received our steaks cold. If that wasn't enough, two of our steaks were over cooked. After dinner, we got a few desserts to share for the table, one of which was baked Alaska. If you've ever had baked Alaska, it's not a difficult dessert to make. The baked Alaska was the worst I've ever had. The cake was frozen and they poured way too much 151 on it when the flambe'd it. Not the dinner experience you're expecting when you spend all that money.
