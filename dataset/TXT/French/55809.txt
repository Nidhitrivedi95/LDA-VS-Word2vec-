rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A pretty good food for brunch. but def over priced. the steak and frites was by far the best thing out of the: white sausage and eggs, corned beef hash and eggs, waffles, chicken and waffles. the pastries were ok. not the best ive had. i probably would not go here again. however like i said, the steak and frites were good. the fries were perfect thin and salt. and the steak and tender.
