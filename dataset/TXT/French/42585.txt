LI2gZ017EM3_5gy8Z1QR9w Great restaurant!

The menu seemed to be a mix of italian and french foods.

We each started with a glass of Pinot Grigio and the fig, prosciutto, goat cheese tapas to share.  The presentation was very nice.  There were 3 morsels on a bed of arugula and balsamic glaze.  The taste was amazing!  A combination of sweet, salty, creamy, and zesty.  I would definitely recommend this appetizer.

For our mains, my girlfriend had the cornish hen wrapped in prosciutto with vegetables and garlic mash.  Again, it did not fail the tastometer!  It was fantastic and cooked perfectly.  It was a tad salty, but that's because the prosciutto infused into the hen.
I was in the mood for a pasta since I rarely eat pasta, so I ordered the seafood linguini in a white wine sauce.  It was okay.  It had lots of variety of seafood - calamari, octopus, cozze, shrimp, I think it had some fish in there too.  The sauce had a nice light flavour too, not too overbearing.

We chose not to order a dessert, as we were both stuffed.

There was a pleasant ambiance and the decor was nice too.

Overall, we were very satisfied with Sorrel.
