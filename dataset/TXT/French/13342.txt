4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I had dinner here with my husband. I had the steak with caramelized onions and red wine sauce and my husband had the filet mignon. The meat was tender, flavorful and well cooked. Didn't really care for the frites. Our waiter was pretty curt and too the point  and made sure to let us know he's worked there for 13 years. I didn't care much for him either. The other waiters seemed very attentive and friendly. Other than our service there everything was great.
