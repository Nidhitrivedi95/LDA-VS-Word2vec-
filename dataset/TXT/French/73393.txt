xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g Found by being escorted up one floor by elevator. The elevator door opens to a view of the busy kitchen. Interesting to see. Seemed clean and bright and well managed. 

Fabulous views of the Bellagio fountain show if you dine after 3pm. Very romantic setting. Attentive and polite service. 

I had a garden salad and the creamed French onion soup. The salad was beautifully presented in a cucumber wrap. Unfortunately it was drowned in olive oil and has no flavor. I didn't taste any but oil. The creamed French onion soup had potential but was over powered by salt. The cheesy crouton was salty enough for a less salt ladened soup. My boyfriend had the veggie crepe which was ok. Nothing creative tastebud-wise. The prices are high as is customary along the LV strip. Overall a three star place.
