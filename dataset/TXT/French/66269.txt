uP3H5bcsiTXM0k0xQhRndg It's not every day I give a establishment a 5/5. In fact it's never happened. Robin Square has set a new benchmark for the perfect restaurant. From the get go you see big smiles and happy faces both in the staff welcoming you and the patrons sitting at their tables. A family owned establishment promoting local produce and market. The menu is short but covers all the essentials (veg, meat and fish). Staff were attentive but not overly American style.

We ordered the soup to share, chicken Caesar salad and Beef shoulder as well as two local beers. What can I say? The soup was fantastic. I'm not big on soup but it was tasty and came with fresh bread. The chicken Caesar was HUGE. Enough for three people. Amazing taste and not over the top on sauce. And here we are to the most Amazing meal I have ever had. The Beef shoulder was cooked perfectly. It sat on a cheese polenta which was to die for.

I recommended this place 5 stars
