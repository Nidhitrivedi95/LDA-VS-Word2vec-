u-SvRRAfYgpbXZRfQgcTzA with all the 5 Star rating this place got, i had to try it for myself...

First thing comes to mind when you visit this place, is whether or not it stands up to Kazu... my verdict? Naaaaaaah !!!! lol

On this point i agree with Concertina F. but whereas none of Kazu's dishes disapoint   SOME dishes at Imadake do... and this despite the damn lineup at kazu, their habit of constant price INFLATION, their limited menu, no fried items  and their cash only policy...

On to the food... :)
we had, ramen, beef tongue, chicken karaage, jelly fish salad, eel soup, eel omelet, agedashi tofu, bacon wrapped asparagus, and tempura.

of note is the beef tongue, quite delicious, tender and good flavor, I know I kissed a cow... And I liked it :P. The jelly fish salad was nice, refreshing, light and refreshing, except the portion was unforgivably small.

The rest was just all right nothing spectacular, one miss is the omelet, too much sugar, It's an omelet not flan!!! lol :P

Tempura was average, but really no one messes that one up... well except hot and spicy buffet, where it's as big as a celery stick and mostly batter lol.

chicken was good, but I like chicken karaage, so it was fine, but I've had better, at sumo ramen and ichiban. 

the eel soup was another miss, the dashi was weak, no flavor depth, but the eel was good.

The agedashi was good, good soy sauce dashi, and the tofu was silky.

The bacon asparagus was a bit on the bland side, a dash of teriyaki or miso would have been nice.

Final verdict? more style than substance, small dishes... but nice drinks.
