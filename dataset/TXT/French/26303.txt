For a party of 4, we split 3 appetizers - ricotta gnocci with spring vegetables and rapini pesto, venison tartare, and salmon gravlax over rosti potatoes.  The gnocchi was quite a bit more spring vegetables than gnocchi, but the gnocci that was there had a beautiful sear on it that enhanced the flavor of the dish beautifully.  The tartare and the gravlax were also very tasty and interestingly prepared.

For mains, 2 of us (including myself) had the quail in white wine Dijon sauce, 1 had the duck breast in rapini pesto, and 1 had the venison chop.  All of the entrees were MASSIVE, and none of us were able to finish the entire thing.  The quail was the best I've ever had, and the sauce was incredibly flavorful and paired well with the vegetables and potatoes as well.  I probably ate a stick of butter in the process, but it was worth it.  Tried pieces of the duck and venison as well.  The duck was tasty and perfectly cooked, but very rich.  The venison chop was tasty as well, and came plated on the biggest hunk of buttery-cheesy mashed potatoes I've ever seen intended for one person.  We opted out of dessert, since we couldn't even finish the entrees in front of us.  All in all, a fantastic meal that was worth the price tag.  Definitely recommend this place to locals and tourists alike!
