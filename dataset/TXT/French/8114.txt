Some of the other items had at our table were, fish, filet mignons, chicken, vegetarian and salad.  Everyone said that they liked the food and the presentation was great!  

My burger was really tender and cooked to perfection, the bun was tender (a bit big), I had mine with gruyere cheese and that was a nice touch and added some great flavor.  

The main reason that I wanted to write this review is to rave about the fries (or frittes I believe they're called)... they're the craziest thing ever!  They were like a hybrid of a french fry and a potato chip, but soft, yet crunchy... I can't even explain it, they were so good I could have had a meal just entirely of those!  I also did try my wife's hanger steak and it wasn't too bad either, tender and juicy for  sure!  

Their menu was smaller and not a lot of dishes that stood out to me... I really didn't give it a thorough read over, because I was in the mood for a big ol' juicy messy sloppy burger!

Overall, really cool atmosphere, nice and friendly servers/waitstaff  and excellent fries.....
