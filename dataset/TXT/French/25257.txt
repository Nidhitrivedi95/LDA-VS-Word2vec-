Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA Sure, it's a very nice restaurant.  But this is a town full of nice restaurants.

The space is amazing - you take a glass elevator up to the top of THEhotel, and step into a cross between a nightclub and an 1960's movie version of heaven's lobby with a huge chandelier taking up most of the room.  There are spectacular views of the strip ( ask for a table with a view ), as well as an outdoor balcony area ... 65 floors up.

As others have mentioned, the tasting menu is a little bit ... difficult to obtain.  We were one of the later reservations of the evening, and were rather put out to discover that the chef was uninterested in providing us with his best at that hour.  They did not indicate that full service would be unavailable when we made our reservation.

After that rather rough start, service was very friendly and personal.

The food was fine, but nothing to write home about.  Roasted Curry Lobster is definitely the stand out - a more adventurous combination of flavors.  Otherwise, they have a foie dish, tuna tartare, steak and seafood that are not particularly different, or memorable.  Even the chef's tasting is just a combination of regular menu items.

So - go for the setting and the view, but don't expect to always be able to get the tasting, and look forward to a competent but rather uninspired dinner.
