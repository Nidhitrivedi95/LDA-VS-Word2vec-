XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q Joel Robuchon has now ruined me for all other food for the rest of my life.  I do not see how this experience could have been any more exemplary. The flavors, impeccable. The seasonings, perfection. Subtle yet potent all at once,  and ever changing. I know that doesn't even make sense. But it does. For first course I tried: the caviar topped with 24kt gold of course,  beets with green mustard,  live Maine lobster and foie gras which literally MELTED on my tongue. Main course: beef with marrow foam, Iberico pork with truffles. Dessert: a beautiful display of chocolate made to look like a mushroom in the wild. They even fashioned "moss covered rocks" from brandy soaked cherries rolled in pistachio powder. I sampled a berry dessert, then I picked from the cart of sweets. Last,  I had an herbal infusion tea from imported fresh cut herbs tableside.  Some of the wines are $10,000 a bottle. The bread is fresh baked daily. The butter is imported from Brittany,  France and the best I've ever tasted. Everything was the best of the best. This isn't just food, this is art. This is an experience. This is legendary. Joel robuchon is clearly a genius.
