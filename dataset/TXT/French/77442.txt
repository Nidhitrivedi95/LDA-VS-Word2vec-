YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g We came here for the Bloody Mary bar and at 18.00 it was a good strong drink with prawns, bacon, and all the other custom fixings you desire.my friend and I shared the tasting menu which was huge for $28 and pretty amazing. Red velvet pancakes, short rib eggs Benedict , hash browns, and all were delicious . The omelet is the only thing that lacked in both flavor and texture. It was not the traditional French veggie omelet but rather dry and meh flavorless. Service great!
