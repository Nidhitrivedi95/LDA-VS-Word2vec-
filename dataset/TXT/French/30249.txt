FRuuIDOd21pTJHvEGIt1Gg Went for dinner on Fri night. I love that their kitchen is open late . Nice restaurant that you wanna dress up a little bit for. The salmon tartare as an app was very good.  The lobster ravioli was perfect... the most perfect ravioli I've ever eaten. BF had the shepherd's pie which was delicious! The food 
presentation was aesthetically pleasing.  Topped it off with profiteroles for dessert. Our waiter was very nice and attentive helping us choose items on the menu. When we left the staff behind the bar wished us a good night. Def reccommend this place open late, great ambiance and decor, friendly service and most importantly great food.
