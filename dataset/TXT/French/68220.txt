vg55SAkrEmuHpWfIMtJjBQ As close to casual culinary perfection as you can get.  A frequent visitor to Pittsburgh, I've been to some of its finest eateries. Last night a very negative experience at a "hot" restaurant receiving lots of buzz was followed by an angry search for an alternative. Two business associates and I arrived at Legume at 8:50 pm, 10 minutes before last seating, and we were welcomed by a delightful hostess. Molly, our waitress, was friendly, professional, and clearly had expertise related to the always-changing menu.

From the Beef Tartare forward the appetizers were extraordinary.  The cold Asparagus.soup was such a light mix of complimentary tastes I ordered a second serving.  The Goat Loin entree was incredible both in taste and preparation.  I'm not typically a dessert eater but . . . Wow!  

Suffice it to say, I'll jump on any opportunity to return. Did I say, "Wow?"  I meant it!
