sphMzEIqY1I2Dzv3zLZY2g This is one of those places you really want to like but it gets harder and harder to every visit. It's always empty when we walk in besides on the weekends when they have live music. We ordered water, one app, and split a meal. $60. Did I mention they charge you $5 to split a meal? I've never had that happen, and feel we overpaid for the experience and service. Waitress was hard to communicate with as she was extremely socially awkward. Felt like pulling teeth just to place the order. The menu is very limited. Won't be back sadly, gave it too many chances. (Decor and ambiance was nice, so added an extra star)
