YUFxSG6idHePsxOmnSHtpQ Good food.  Their bread and muffins get five stars. I gave it three stars because I'm not a super huge fan of all the times on their menu.  Could be me.  the food is really good, but it's just a personal opinion.  I guess back in the day, I ordered a turkey sandwich here that was dry as a bone... sorta sticks.

I hear their breakfasts are out of this world.. maybe i'll go there and redo my review.
