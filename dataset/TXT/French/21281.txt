B56AYe5GNuavMDtwFsXqzA This past weekend I was in Scottsdale for some Giants spring training games. My buddy invited me out to a french dinner for an early birthday celebration

We had a 7:45 reservation which we were very late for but we called to let them know that we were delayed but still coming. We finally arrived at the Bistro around 8:30 and were seated right away. One thing about Arizona is that most locals stay home if the temperature is below 70F :)

The vibe was very mellow with a cool European chalet decor and soft classic french music playing . 

Our table was perfectly situated in the far corner allowing us to survey the entire dining area. We received excellent service by a friendly and knowledgeable staff. We had a great selection of dishes ... escargots, foie gras, duck and bouillabaisse that were delicious and perfectly prepared. 

I loved everything about this bistro and thoroughly enjoyed my early Birthday dinner.

The owners are a husband and wife. The husband is the head chef who I personally thanked for an amazing meal. 

A must do spot for my 2013 Spring Training trip!
