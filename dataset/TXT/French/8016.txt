4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I highly recommend reservations although if you want to sit outside on the patio, it is first come, first serve.

The service is pretty good although the table next to us found it to be lacking.  I had the steak and frites which was cooked well.  Drink selection is pretty good as well.  The atmosphere is very dark and quaint- perfect for a nice night out before a show.
