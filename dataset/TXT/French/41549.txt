kIW8IeTV3W1tS_q_WAU4wQ While spending an extended weekend stay in Montreal, a group if us ( eleven ) decided to have dinner here at the recommendation of our hotel concierge. 
We were seated in a semi-private room which was perfect for the birthday celebration we had planned. 
Our server, Harold, was great. I am sure it is tough walking into a huge group of gay guys who are intent on drinking a lot and having fun. Harold warmed up to us quickly and made our dining experience fantastic. Not only was he professional and highly efficient, he was able to handle us with a sense of humor and made us feel welcomed. 

The food was delicious as well as beautifully presented. I highly recommend the warm beet salad, I love beets but have never had a salad like this  . . . amazing ! The beef entree for two, can actually feed at least three, if not four, depending upon how hungry you are. 

I will always stop here when I am in Montreal!
