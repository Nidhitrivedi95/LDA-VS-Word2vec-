wuuJhxMDAj5gGVdvobGHJg Outstanding restaurant.  From the knowledgeable waitstaff to the amazing tartare's to the divine lamb chops,  this was a piece of culinary heaven in Montreal. The venue and kitchen is meant for a more intimate group, but our group of 9 were seated quickly. The food came slower than expected; but in the end was well worth the wait. 

Don't know when we'll  be back in Montreal but Les Trois will be on our agenda for sure!
