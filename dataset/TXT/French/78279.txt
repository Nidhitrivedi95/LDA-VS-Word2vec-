YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g The past month all I was dreaming about was having a delicious burger and some foie. Since its banned in California, I thought Fleur by Huber Keller would be the best selection. This all stemmed from seeing Hubert Keller on Bizarre Foods making one and it's looked so juicy and delicious!! 

Unfortunately mine didn't look so great. Underneath all the sliced truffles was a hidden piece of foie gras, the total opposite of what I've seen advertised around portraying the famous Fleur burger. I Somewhat felt cheated. Was it worth $70? I'd strongly have to say no. But  hey, it's Vegas, we came to gamble!

On the other hand, my wife's potato crusted flounder was great and unique. 

We also had the prosciutto flatbread and that, in my opinion, wasn't up to Hubert Keller's standards. 

Service exceeded our expectations and the server was quite helpful in picking out a wine to compliment our meal.
