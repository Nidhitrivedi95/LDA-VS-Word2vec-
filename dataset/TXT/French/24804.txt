COgwFthJpS4We16W5Gf4lw Went last night with party of four and was pleasantly surprised by the intimate interior. We did the 5 course menu for $56, which is a great price for all that's included. The only stumbling block was the duck. It lacked some seasoning and the skin wasn't crispy. The grand marnie soufflé, however, was fantastic! Overall, we were there almost 2 1/2 hours and had a wonderful evening. Would recommend to anyone who is a local and hasn't ventured in.
