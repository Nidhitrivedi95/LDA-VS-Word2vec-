Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA I loved this restaurant! I had never heard of it before my last trip to vegas, but this time I went with a friend and her parents treated us to dinner here. The restaurant itself is very nice inside and the view is amazing. We would have sat outside if it wasn't 100 degrees at night! 
I ordered the Cod Brandade and a side of asparagus and it was delicious. Probably the best piece of fish I've ever had. I also tried my friend's Lobster Curry and it was amazing. For an appetizer the table shared the Potato Gnocchi which was... you guessed it- delicious. Everything was rich and flavorful. 
The cocktails were good, but I wouldn't say they were amazing. And my friend was surprised with a dessert since it was her birthday.
The only reason I don't think it deserved 5 stars was because the waitress seemed to forget about us quite often, even though the restaurant was relatively empty. I would still refer this restaurant to a friend, and go back myself.
