4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Let's just say 1 star sums it all up! Our small group weekend brunch was very disappointing. We waited an hour for food even though they weren't busy, our server was never around probably cause he knew the gratuity was included, and most importantly the food was very underwhelming. Fyi the chef needs to learn about using salt for starters. Only good thing to say is they have gluten free bread. Won't ever be back though!
