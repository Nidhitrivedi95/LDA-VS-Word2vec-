xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g I celebrated my birthday dinner with my boyfriend this year at the Eiffel Tower Restaurant and it was amazing. It was a late Friday night and we were starving. We headed in without a reservation and were seated in just a few minutes. 

Yes.. it is a bit pricey, however you get what you pay for. I had the most amazing filet mignon ever! I do understand how the size of the filet is a bit small however, it's well worth it, as it's quality over quantity here. You do have a choice of sides which allows you to try even more of their delicious menu. I do not remember our waiter's name that night (May 11), but the service was impeccable from the moment we walked in. The view of the Bellagio fountains definitely adds to the ambiance of this restaurant. It was definitely money well spent.

My boyfriend and I enjoyed our experience so much, we returned to the restaurant on May 18th. Unfortunately, there was a wait for a table, but we were excited that we could sit at the bar and eat without a wait. Keith/Cory H. served us our food and drinks... and suggested the amazing Eiffel Tower Soufflé. We were in heaven after getting both the pistachio and chocolate sauces to mix into our soufflé. It is definitely a MUST for anyone visiting this restaurant.
