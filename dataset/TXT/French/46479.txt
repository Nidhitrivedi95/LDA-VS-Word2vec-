nKeGPmH5dYNVL5AyAItuKg I'd been dying to try this place for forever, and it was good, but not great. Service is a great part of the experience with regards to customer service, but dinner took almost 3 hours, where we were waiting 45 minutes between courses for food. 

The pate was the best dish, as it was creamy, light and delicious (definitely order it!). The tartar was nothing special, and definitely could have been a pass. The duck, beef and pork were all good, with the duck being the star with a smokey flavour and nice tender breast pieces. The fries and the cheese poufs were good, hot and fresh!

The best was definitely the drinks. All of the ingredients in the drinks were present and delicious, and nothing was too sweet.
