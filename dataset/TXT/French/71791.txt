XFdS4GgrgFsuyyrQZp8jMw I was recently invited back to Frunchroom and I must say, my experience was much better. Firstly, the service was great. The waiter paid attention to detail and was present but not overbearing. Secondly, they finally have their signature items on their menu. Their deep dish pizza was great! 

It's nice to see that they have worked out their kinks and things are working much more smoothly now! Worth a try!
