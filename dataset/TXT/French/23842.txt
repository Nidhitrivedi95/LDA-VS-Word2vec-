cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg An ode to pork.  We went here on the recommendation of a chef.  My only complaint is that there are too many  delicious indulgences to savor and not enough time or belly capacity to taste it all.  We had an extremely ambitious 5 course meal.   Beef carpaccio, beef bone marrow with caviar,  fois gras poutine...  it was at this point that I lost feeling in my toes and started to slip into a food induced coma.  Then the namesake dish, pied de cochon over casoulet and more fois gras.  It was foodie nirvana!  If you've only got one night in town get around to this place.
