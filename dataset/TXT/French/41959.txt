Kut9tVbDX_f7qKMRRoXg3w Thank you for the wonderful crepes. They were the last meal we at on our trip to Montréal. Absolutely fabulous. Large. Great salad. Great dressing. Just enough syrup, meat, and cheese. My favorite was how the brie, cheddar, and goat cheese all complimented each other with the smokey ham which was chopped just perfectly.

Great surroundings, too. Perfect location. Walking distance from Notre Dame.

They advertise wifi, but we weren't able to find the network.
