X8lYvkI2Yv7f96cz4uE9LQ Not sure why this place gets such a high rating on other sites. We went there because Tripadvisor users rated it as the No. 1 restaurant in Montreal. We were quite shocked when we were presented with the food especially when how all the users rated its outstanding presentation. The presentation was very old school and not that great at all to be honest. It was more like a mess with some dressings dripped on the side. 

And the taste is very very average at best from the appetizers to the main courses. Any popular Montreal restaurant would beat it for taste for sure. The service is super slow too. Don't go there if you are hungry!!!
