rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I'll admit to my Thomas Keller fixation: I've consumed at French Laundry, Bouchon (Nor Cal) and I've now moved onto his cookbooks. 

So of course, when the opportunity for Bouchon Las Vegas presents itself...

The most remarkable difference between Bouchon (Nor Cal) and Bouchon (Las Vegas) is the staff. No, not the staff that takes your orders, brings your food and caters to your dining whims: the folks at both locations are friendly, efficient and supremely competent. 

It's the set of folks at door. Unlike the pleasantries you might be greeted with at Bouchon (Nor Cal), the Bouchon (Las Vegas) entourage might greet you with confusion or disdain. 

During my first visit to Bouchon (LV), I chalked this up as an aberration. But now I suspect that Bouchon (LV) might be hiring from a pool of TAO rejects..or graduates. Which is worse? 

If you can put that first minute of the Bouchon LV experience aside, you will be rewarded. 

The muscles and fries are always phenomenal. The wine list is always extensive and superb. Again, 5 stars for service. 

Bouchon (LV) is an oasis of authenticity in a sea of Vegas sheen, once you get past the door.
