j9d1c73emq6sL0v5IfrC-w One of my favourite places on Mount Royal for a drink with a friend when I want to talk quietly and put delicious things in my mouth. The wine list is excellent and the staff are super informed but not condescending, they are excited to talk at any level about the wine their sommelier/owner has selected. They are also just generally super friendly and chill. The food here can be too pricey for me for a casual evening if I'm really hungry, but I've also had delicious filling amazing vegetarian dishes here that seemed totally appropriate in their pricing, so depends a bit on the menu that day I guess. The roast cauliflower is one of my favourite things ever, and allllll the desserts are daydream-worthy.
