ohMpNug5zWNxOlL6ShG7Ig Update 11/22/16: A repeat of Cafe Bink tonight.  We had their calamri appetizer, and it was excellent, without any dipping sauces.  After this evening, I think that a really good calamri doesn't  need a sauce.

Our mains, salmon and trout were very good.

Caved on to the nut dessert: decadent!

The service was attentive and excellent, but the kitchen was quite slow.  Expect a relaxing meal, so don't be in a rush.  The quality of the meal is worth the wait.
