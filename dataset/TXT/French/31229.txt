gh6__q2WXFuyN8gt6VAnWw I shall start this as clear as I can...if you have not been here...YOU ARE A FOOL! I married Portuguese and outside of my mother in law's house, I have never felt so welcomed, at home and part of a family. Luby, the owner, personally welcomes you to her 'home'. With a smile and personal care.

The food, AMAZING! I'm a linguica junkie and whether you call it linguica or chorizo, it has to be the BEST I've ever had (sorry to my Portuguese family).

Whether it's seafood, chicken, pork, beef or just vegetables the food, the atmosphere, the experience and the feeling that mom is making dinner just for you only falls short of mom actually making dinner just for you.

Kisses and hugs to Luby and the gang at Vila Algarve. I'm so happy to have found a place to call home being so new to Las Vegas.
