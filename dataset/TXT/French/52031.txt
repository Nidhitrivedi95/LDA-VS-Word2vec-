pmoIMK8zGWvKsVOPDBYfzg The service was superb! The food - freaking salty! First taste was really good, but towards the middle of the meal, felt like I was just eating salt. We had the Escargot - salty. I had the Lobster Bisque soup - salty.  My friend had the French Onion soup - super salty. Even the rib eye was salty. I'm glad we didn't pay the full price and used Travelzoo voucher, even with the voucher, I'm not sure I would come back. It really felt like we paid $200 for salt. Should have gone to dinner somewhere else. Disappointed...
