d482l58ho0_IMdFkXX1F5Q Can't wait to dine here again! The food was amazing and reasonably priced for a quality strip restaurant. The dessert definitely made it into my top 5 desserts to date. White Chocolate Framboise! I can't stop thinking about it. The ambiance is very elegant and lively. Overall, just a pleasant dining experience. I noticed they do a lunch & dinner prefixe as well as a daily happy hour menu, which I can't wait to try.
