cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg Come here when you are hankering for a truly decadent meal.  Au Pied De Cochon is one of those places that lives up to all your expectations and then some.  Right off the bat you can tell that it is all about the food. The atmosphere is bustling, cozy and nice, but no frills.  It took a while to decide on which items we would get but eventually we decided on two special appetizers: 

-A salad with a poached egg on top and the best bacon I've ever had
-A soft shell crab maki roll with foie gras (O.M.G. one of the best things I've ever eaten though it sounds crazy weird)

And the rest of this to split:
-PDC seafood platter $50 level? (SO worth it, highly recommended! So much work goes into their raw seafood platters, it's not just raw oysters and clams. In addition, it came with escargot in a black bean sauce, conch, mussels with a nice tomato broth, fancy mini melon balls in the raw oysters, sea jelly?!? in some fancy oysters, calamari with delicious aoli, a skewer of lightly fried white fish, some truly amazing scallops.)
-Lamb Shank (perfectly cooked, wanted more and more- huge portion!)
-Foie gras tart with blood sausage (SO SO GOOD. light puff pastry topped with caramelized onions, creamy melt in your mouth foie gras, with bites of sausage. big enough to share for two!)

The bill with beers ended up being way cheaper than I thought I was going to spend going in.  The portions were generous and the quality of the food was tremendous.  I encourage trying anything on the foie gras menu because you probably won't find better preparations then here.  No wonder this is one of Anthony Bourdain's favorite spots. This will definitely be a part of any future trips to Montreal!
