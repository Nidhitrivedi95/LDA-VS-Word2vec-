On my most recent breakfast there, I had the bagel and lox (nothing special compared to other places), a coffee, and an orange juice (fresh). Total was over $40. I believe a comparable meal can be had for $20-25 elsewhere - with comparable service. So you pay a fairly large premium for something they looks slightly upscale. I don't value this too much - but that's a personal preference thing.
