KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA Oh, what happened to this wonderful desert gem? I should have realized what I was in for when they got fancy with the pronunciation of their name! (We all say bacchus, but they now answer the phone with Ba-koos.) The "No, we really ARE French" theme continued with the waiter's fake French accent, which faded in and out, getting REALLY annoying when he was overwhelmed. 
We arrived after making a reservation a month earlier, and still couldn't get a decent table. We asked to be by the water, but the area where we were first seated had no shade. The mister system was out - management blamed that on a customer. We were seated inside, though I went here to be seated by the water. (We are repeat customers, and always go on Bastille Day; this year I took a group of 6 women for Sunday Brunch the day before.)
My daughter had to wait over 10 minutes to pay for a bottle of wine, and she was the only person purchasing.
After waiting over an hour for our meals, the waiter brought out 2 more charcuterie trays "on the house". Never mind that we still had the first 2, largely untouched because they were pretty lousy. 
The bottomless mimosas were great, and they did keep filling our glasses. At one point, it was to distract us from the fact that we'd asked for bread 3 times and it still wasn't delivered to our table. I had to ask for orange juice in my mimosa, even though I'd already had 2 in the same glass.
The meal finally arrived, and the food was delicious. My Black Truffle Oil Grits with Beef Grillades was incredibly good, and everyone loved their meals.
We were just all profoundly saddened by the disappointing experience at one of our favorite restaurants. The manager offered his card so that he could make it up to us with a free appetizer next time; I declined, as my friend has his card from the last time he came and had a terrible experience! I hope they pull their act together.
