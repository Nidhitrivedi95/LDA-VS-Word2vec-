4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I brought my 9 year old niece visiting from Florida who aspires to be a French chef and travel to Paris someday. It was evident we were struggling with an order for the child and at no time was a children's menu offered so I ended up ordering a salad, two sides and a basic classique steak.  She did not care for the salad bc she is young and the vinaigrette dressing was so strong (I loved it) so I got online to look for a restaurant that would cater to children better.  I ended up seeing on google the children's menu for mon ami. Really? Why on earth wouldn't you OFFER the menu when I'm sitting with a 9 yr old and I was asking twenty questions about seasoning etc to make the meal kid friendly. The bill was $80 and I could have had a better experience at Outback. The waitress was too busy with the larger parties to give us the service we deserved. I'm a local and mom ami used to be my favorite date spot or special lunch and I am sorely disappointed. I ended up asking for the children's menu options which my niece was pleased with but this was far too difficult for such a pricey meal my niece was so excited I was disappointed.  Pass on eating here again.
