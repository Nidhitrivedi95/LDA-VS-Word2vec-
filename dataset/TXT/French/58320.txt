rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A First off, I love that fact that the staff is open and friendly. But what sold me was the roasted chicken. I know, I know, chicken is for those who don't know what to get. But I'm so glad my wife got the chicken which was recommended by a couple on the next table. It was absolutely fantastic!!! I never experienced chicken whose texture was so luscious and smooth.  I still dream of the next time I can go back and order it all for myself.  Also, Anthony Bourdain had to admit that the french fries at Bouchon rival his fries, and he thinks he has the best fries this side of the Atlantic!  Well worth the money!
