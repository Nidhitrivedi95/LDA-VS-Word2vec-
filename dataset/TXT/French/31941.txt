gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA I made a reservation on OpenTable for an early celebration of my husband's birthday. I bought one of those deals from Travelzoo (ha! but the rest of the trip was expensive so why not save a little money where you can? :D), and wasn't sure it would be honored since it was Memorial Day Weekend. When I arrived, our server was very pleasant, and asked for the voucher straight away. 

Like other reviewers have said, if you have a voucher, you don't get window seating, but I don't think that detracts from the experience. From any seat in the restaurant, you can see all of the strip and the mountains. I think it's unfortunate that it is located inside the Palms, which is not a very nice hotel. This aspect takes a bit away from the experience IMO. They have a check-in desk in the hotel lobby, and the hostess directs you to a special roped-off elevator that takes you to the 56th floor.

All the service was excellent, and since we told our server straight-away that we wanted only cocktails, we did not have the same rude experience with their sommelier.

The food is A M A Z I N G. Everything is carefully plated, with gorgeous presentation. My husband and I had a wonderful experience there, and we would definitely go again.
