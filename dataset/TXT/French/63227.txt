SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA I took my husband here for a special occasion and the entire experience was wonderful. The food came as expected and was thoroughly enjoyable, the warm brownie dessert was gone in a flash, and the service was impeccable. Truly a gem in Cleveland since many other fine dining establishments fall short in service. Even though the small dining area became full over the course of our meal it was never too loud that we had to raise our voices to speak to one another. Our server was very nice and friendly. I really enjoyed the attention he provided from wiping off the table to get crumbs and tidbits before dessert to asking if he could clear my plate before taking it. The service was comparable to fine dining in Chicago. Very nice to finally see in Cleveland! 

Some of the other diners showed up in completely unacceptable attire. Zip up hoodies, sweatpants, tennis shoes; one woman had the audacity to arrive in a bright pink Gap pull over sweatshirt with the large Gap insignia on the chest. You know what I'm talking about. The restaurant's offerings and service deserve respect and I personally think that they should enforce a strict dress code. It adds to the ambiance and atmosphere to require a collared shirts and no jeans. For anyone reading this review.. please do us all a favor and dress yourself appropriately for the price point. No one wants to enjoy a romantic/quiet, nice dinner with you in your sweaty workout clothes at the next table. 

I will happily return and will tell others!
