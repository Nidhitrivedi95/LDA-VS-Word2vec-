4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I've been here 3 times over the course of a year and this place is gluten free done exceptionally well.  Just let your server know you have to be gluten free and they will accommodate you perfectly.  Almost all items except the table side begets can be made free.
I had the french option soup (they even toasted gluten free bread and put it on top) and they were even nice enough to brings gluten free bread, olives, etc. as table appetizers... a really nice touch.  An less you wonder if it was really gluten free, they put a little wooden flag on the dish to let you know that they handled it as GF and took it seriously.  The main course was a delicious steak topped with merlot butter (I couldn't get the blue-cheese spread because it's not available as gluten free) and star fries (yes, the shoestring fries are GF) and asparagus.  Everything was delicious and won't let you down.
