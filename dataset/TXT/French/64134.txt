tCSlpwJQ4CZsUEMZeH2SFg I found this from a living social. And since then, I have been in love with this place! I will never get tired of their Charcuterie - various cured meat and pickled vegetables! It's just simply delicious and I feel like I'm in Europe.  I am a big fan of their moules frites and shrimp & artichoke crepes are very yummy and big.  I always like to treat myself to some macarons afterwards! 

Very quaint place and so close to where I live. It's a win win situation!
