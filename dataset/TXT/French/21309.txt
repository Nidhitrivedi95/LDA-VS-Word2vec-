B56AYe5GNuavMDtwFsXqzA We ate dinner here for the 1st time while in Scottsdale over the weekend. We didn't have a reservation but the friendly staff seated us immediately anyway. We loved the food, some of the best we have in Scottsdale/Phoenix area. We all ordered something different and everything was full of flavor. Our waitress was exceptional. Very friendly, helpful and we loved her accent! We will definitely dine here again when we visit in a month.
