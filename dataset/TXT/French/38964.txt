jLxeBgWhLRbII2ACkgH1Sg I picked up some goodies here for a dinner party.  I was looking for a cake, but they only had single serving pastries/cake slices, so I decided to go with what I felt was the most festive looking treat - the orange pinwheels.  Not only were they pretty, but they were very tasty - flaky, crispy, sweet (but not overly sweet), and tangy.  These treats were well liked and were quite delicious with a cup of hot coffee.  I also got a plain mini croissant and a pistachio roll on the side.  The mini croissant was very flaky and tasty.  The pistachio roll was pretty but didn't have enough pistachio flavor for my taste.

The pastries here run for about $2-$4 each.  They are pretty large, so one pastry with a cup of coffee would be just the right size for breakfast/small snack.  The bakery was pretty crowded when I came by - maybe that's why the cashiers weren't warm and friendly?  They weren't unpleasant, but the service here is nothing to write home about.

All in all, it's a pretty solid bakery with decently priced pastries.  I will be back!
