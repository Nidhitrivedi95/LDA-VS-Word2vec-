9ET_RUNztevq4_OLAX80Gg This is a sister restaurant from NYC cafe bouloud which I regularly go to . 

Pros : location is great . Ambiance is ok . Servers are ok 

Food : ok nothing like the nyc cafe bouloud . Apparently they changed the menu to fit in Toronto taste . Not sure what that means . 

Cons: it just doesn't give that Café Boulud feeling you would have in nyc . I feel like they should change the name because it's almost misleading . 

It's overall ok but I don't go wow in this place .
