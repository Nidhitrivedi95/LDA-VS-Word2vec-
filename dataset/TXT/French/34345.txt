HL6ZzGF7V-KDaU0zziHyEA Really enjoyed my prix fixe Valentine's Day dinner here.  My husband and I had tried to get a sort of last-minute table here for other special occasions and you really should reserve ahead.  Anyways it was one of the pricier tables.  After reviewing the menu we were not expecting a lot.  However, our meal was delicous and the sommelier does a wonderful job.  Very impressed on balance with our wine flight pairing.  I rarely get to say that.  Based on one visit, for me - this is as good as it gets in Montreal for the food alone.  The environment is a bit stale but perfect for a special occasion and romantic as we were seated by the fireplace and our server was just perfect and really made everything right.  I lived in the NYC area for 5-6 years and it has become my benchmark for fine dining world wide.  I have tried at least 80% of the top fine dining restaurants in Montreal.  Recently, Chasse et Peche which was our second though we've been to Le Filet their sister restaurant many times (another favorite of mine), Chez l'Epicier and Europea last month.  What I look for in a great restaurant experience is to be surprised for a 1 or more dishes.  So I also look at the ease of obtaining the ingredients (it it hard for me?), interesting flavor profiles/ pairings, superlative freshness of course and advanced techniques that either I'm not familiar with or I might be but it would just be too much effort to coordinate at home.  That having been said I did not think that the dishes were too busy or that some flavors were mentioned in the description but didn't really show up in the final plate.  Personally I would love to see more restaurants like Maison Boulud here in Montreal.  Boulud's flagship is in NYC where he operates 5 restaurants or so.  So happy to have found this place.  I'll be looking for consistency.  Looking forward to trying a cocktail!  We'll be back soon.
