2B46bRpDh49eDyjXGhL_ZQ Wow - we went here because my wife loves crepes. I personally don't like them. Well - that has changed. The crepes Maggie makes are TOTALLY different. So thin and crispy on the outside but soft in the middle. How you can have that much texture in something so thin, I do not know. But she does it. I ate every bite of mine. We opted for sweet options because we had lunch in a few hours. The savory options looked even more appetizing but we didn't want to fill up.

Seriously 5 stars. Absolutely awesome.
