But I enjoyed dining at this place. I tried the Chicken and Waffles. The gravy for the chicken was really good. And it looked like the waffles had bits of bacon and parsley? It was just good. My boyfriend had the breakfast - two eggs, potatoes, and ham. I liked the seasoned potatoes the best. Their coffee was good too. Bold and yummy. 

Overall the service was great. Staff was nice and the food was good. Wouldn't mind eating here again as long as I'm willing to pay a little more. Paid about $65 for brunch... including tip.
