SBnpT6JDbah-5l_52GM5sw I finally had a chance to check this place out, although it was just for a professional networking happy hour. Regardless, the atmosphere is really nice and the service was pleasant.

I guess the only complaint I have is their beer tap handles. They use fashionable knobs that all look the same and lack any sort of labeling. Sure, it looks pleasing to the eye, but I want a beer and I don't know what you have on tap without bothering you to verbally list everything. Unfortunately, this meant I drank what everyone else was drinking because I didn't want to be that guy in a buys bar taking up too much of the bar tenders time.

Now I just need to come by for a meal and truly experience what Sardine is all about.
