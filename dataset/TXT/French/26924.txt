Dcj69NZJnbJhK-YHP_nULA The smoked turkey was simply one of the most delicious sandwiches I've ever eaten. All the flavors, from the avocado schmear to the lime-chipotle aioli, balance perfectly and transport you to smoky zen.  I was not a fan of the asparagus+artichoke+tomato mishmash served on the side (mealy tomatoes, generally flavorless), but I just left that alone and gave my undivided attention to the sandwich.
