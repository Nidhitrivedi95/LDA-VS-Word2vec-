9iy6scMRbs5ue41XRLGEkw One of 2 of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix!  The food and atmosphere are exquisite!  I have been searching for a great French restaurant ever since I relocated from Tucson a year ago.  This place is also nice, because while it offers traditional French food, it also offers other delicious gourmet dishes.  The menu is relatively small (as it should be), but diverse.  The French onion soup is excellent, as is the Roquefort salad, and the Lobster with risotto.  I have been to this restaurant 3 times in two weeks and cannot recommend it enough.  It's a great lunch spot for professionals and "ladies who lunch" as well as a wonderful romantic dinner spot.
