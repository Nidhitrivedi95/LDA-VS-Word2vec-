My friend was the one who chose this restaurant but she actually wanted to leave once she saw the menu, as she had a hard time picking something that she wanted. They also sold out of one of the apps that she wanted. I didn't want to walk out so she settled on a soup and salad and I had the octopus. Unfortunately, there was nothing special about the octopus. I've definitely had better for less than $28. The dish was pretty underwhelming in flavour. My friend also didn't really enjoy her kale ceaser or sweet pea soup, and found her salad to be overly salty. Service was super friendly, but I don't see myself visiting again anytime soon.
