i2dnic7VdQ3NyiQQWUXHbA I had gone for drinks at the Atwater club next door and spoiled myself with a cheeseburger. I think it might have been the best cheeseburger I'd ever had. It was soooo juicy and saucy. I'm assuming it's the same cheeseburger they serve at Foiegwa since I heard they share their kitchen. Now onto Foiegwa: went very early for breakfast and the place was empty but it got packed around 11. Shared the blueberry ricotta pancakes and the smoked salmon on that wonderful potato hashbrownything. Perfect combo of salty and sweet. Ooooo And their coffee is realllly good. Important to note: do not go with children/babies/toddlers. They will refuse them at the door due to their liquor license.
