2B46bRpDh49eDyjXGhL_ZQ Delightful cafe great for families or singles to feel out of this world.  A little Paris in Las Vegas.

Took the kids for something different kind of breakfast.  We each got our own savory breakfast crepes.  The crepe was thin and light and serving was big enough that we didn't finish what's on our plate.

What we love about their....

Savory Crepes - not greasy breakfast
Dessert crepes - light sweet and delicious.  Not overly sweet like candy
Beverages - coffee, latte, and hot chocolate were on par
Service - Maggie was delightful and friendly.  She had family visiting out of town who donned Santa hats and aprons to help serve us.  Such nice people!
Decor - we sent the kids around the room to learn the French writing around via translation apps.  Great mini game to keep them occupied and learn something profound


We wish you success Maggie.  Thank you for putting so much thought into creating a cute cafe and bringing a different experience to Las Vegas.  You truly light up the venue.
