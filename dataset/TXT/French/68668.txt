The food is very tasty, the portions are huge, the service is friendly and fast, and the menu has a great variety of pastas and Italian-style meat dishes. They also have a kids menu that caters to even my picky eaters.

I had the scallop spaghettini, which was exceptionally good, and my wife had the beef tenderloin medallions which were cooked perfectly and were served with a staggering array of fresh veggies.

All that and they have a decent and affordable wine selection.

Breakfast/brunch and lunch are equally good!
