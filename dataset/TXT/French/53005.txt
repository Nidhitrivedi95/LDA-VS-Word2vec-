QeFsIMcIFIJcOrpthYL8jg We came here for dinner one weekend when we're were visiting Montreal. The service was incredible, our waiter Kim was attentive and personable. The drinks were delicious and creatively named. I highly recommend the bullies de menthe if you like mint. We started with the lamb poutine and the charcuterie plate, both of which were incredible. 
The entrees were sub-par and underseasoned: the lamb burger was over cooked, the truffle cream sauce tagliatelle didn't taste like truffle at all, but the risotto and lamb was cooked perfectly. Overall, I would recommend this spot for a nice dinner and live music.
