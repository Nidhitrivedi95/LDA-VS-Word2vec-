LQ_gYNs5E10IGFE0NOyD7A We had a great time here celebrating a friends bday- they brought us all a round of champagne to celebrate (and it was good champagne :-)) food was good- the noodles weren't my favorite- but the salmon was incredible. The staff was the best part and so accommodating- we will be back!
