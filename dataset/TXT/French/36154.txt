hzyvL2v97xLzLbLXcdi1uw Came in on Easter Sunday for a late lunch. Their menu, while not the biggest, certainly offers something for everyone. Both sweet and savory crepes had good options and we went w/ the Ham and Swiss as well as the Marseille. On the side was the classic French toast and a cup of mocha. The crepes were delicious and packed full of good flavors, wouldn't hesitate ordering them again next time I go. French toast was good too, paired w/ syrup and banana slices, even though I'm not the biggest fan of French toast in general. Service was decent, w/ only the initial getting menus/orders in being slightly slower than I would've liked.
