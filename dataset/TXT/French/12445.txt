4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Thanks to birthday girl this was a nice spot to enjoy a nice evening talking about random things not meant for the dinner table! Haha.. good times! 

Nice view of that fountain across the street weeee...I thought we're in a drought? Great for people watching if you're sitting in the patio. We sat inside, but it was still kinda hot. 

We all had a bite of the dishes we ordered... I really enjoyed my flattened herb chicken breast and salad. Mmmm butter! I also liked the filet mignon...soft and tender...

Yes...order a bottle of wine to go with your meal. You might as well if you're going to have more than one glass!
