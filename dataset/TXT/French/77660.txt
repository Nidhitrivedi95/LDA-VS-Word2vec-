YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g Prepare yourself before going to Fleur de Lys. Are you prepared to drop $400 (for 2) for one of the best meals you might ever have? If so, then this is your place. 

Fleur de Lys is beautiful and romantic, the service is excellent, and the food is amazing. I recommend going with a testing menu. I went with a 4 course tasting menu with wine pairings. Please PLEASE get the wine pairing with your meal. The wines and champagnes were excellent !

I started with some fresh raw kumamoto oysters. They kicked ass and were so fresh. The sauces were also excellent. My boyfriend had the lobster salad and I know he loved it because he ate really slowly to try to savor each bite. This is not at all like him, he's a super fast eater and normally would have polished that salad off in 30 seconds or less. For the second course I had the lobster and my boyfriend had the diver scallops. Both were excellent. For the 3rd course I had the duck breast and my boyfriend had the fillet. The final course was dessert. I had the pistacio souffle and my boyfriend had the chocolate souffle. This was the only strange part of our meal. Every course was small but super flavorful and rich. The desserts were HUGE. The souffles were seriously more food than the previous 3 courses put together. I'm having a hard time complaining that the dessert was too large, but it really was in comparison to the other courses. 

This meal was seriously in my top 3 EVER. If you are in Las Vegas celebrating something, or ready to splurge do not miss Fleur de Lys.
