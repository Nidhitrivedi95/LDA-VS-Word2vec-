4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I got banana crepes with added on strawberries. This dish came with caramel sauce and cream. Very very tasty. The strawberries were fresh cut as well as the bananas.

I also tried some of the steak sandwich. The steak was tender and juicy. Honestly, the best steak I have ever tried hands down no questions asked. I highly recommend the steak here. The bread went very well with the steak. Everything about the steak sandwich was perfect. The fries had just the right amount of salt and were nice and crispy. Very unique fries with the perfect texture.

The service here is wonderful. The waiter told us the specials and made sure I got what I wanted because I came when breakfast was over and they still served me the banana crepes. 

The ambience here at the time I went (1pm) was casual. You get a perfect view of Belagio and you can see the water shoot out in front. Very peaceful. Perfect brunch spot.
