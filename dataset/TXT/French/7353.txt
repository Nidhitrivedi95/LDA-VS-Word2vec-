4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Mon Ami Gabi is super cute!  Make sure you reserve a table before you get there because there was a line and a 1.5 hr wait for people that did not reserve. We were seated in front of the bellagio fountains outside and the weather could not have been any better.  It was such a beautiful view and the scenery seemed like I was in a movie.  The food was amazing!  We ordered scallops, mussels and fries.  We left full and completely satisfied.  The french sangria was also amazing!

I highly recommend this place.
