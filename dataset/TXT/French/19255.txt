aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw I tried the macarons here when I indulged myself and got the six pack.  For $17.50, I had high expectations considering Bouchon's reputation and all.  Their macarons are twice the size of macarons that I've tried before so I was kind of digging that.  Despite their bigger size, the taste and flavor were not compromised.  The cream wasn't too sweet and the cookie part was soft and not dry.  It's too bad that the pastry chef leader or team weren't there at the kiosk at the Venetian where I got these because I'd give each person a high-five for making such damn good macarons!  It's a nice luxurious but expensive treat.  For me, a nice reward to look forward to eat at the end of a typical crazy Vegas trip!

Next up, actually eating at Bouchon the restaurant itself!
