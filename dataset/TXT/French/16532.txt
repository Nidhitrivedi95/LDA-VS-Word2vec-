8ciT6qjI18x9EPtOb-gqYQ What a great gem, possibly one of the few restaurants that isnt based in a strip mall or a hotel.  Instead it is in a nice converted old home, a home that was the owners home when he was a child.  

We were warmly greeted and shown to our table.  We love the fact that this place is BYOB with only a $9 corkage.  In Portland, where we live, most places don't allow BYOB and if they do its usually $15-25 a bottle.   Instead we were able to enjoy wine we picked out ourselves to match our tastes and budget.  

We started off with  a tasty cheese and onion savory tart with greens.  Then we each chose a salad, both were good though my wife's choice the Taleggio was much better especially with the Prickly Pear Vinaigrette and Teleggio Cheese.  

For Entrees my wife chose the duck and I opted for the Filet.  The duck was really savory, the rhubarb glaze was the highlight of the dish.  I only got two little bites but each was very good.  The Filet was good a nice piece of meat, the horseradish creme fraiche was a nice touch but it was the amazing locally grown heirloom tomatoes that put the dish apart.  Great acidity to match up with the meat.

For dessert we split the carmel chocolate tart which was sort of a crisp brownie base with a gooey carmel that was a good way to finish the evening though the next time we come back we will opt for a few nice cheeses instead. 

A wonderful setting, great staff, plenty of parking and great food for a very reasonable price.  What more could you ask for? Well even though they seem quite busy the night we were there they now have a summer special limited menu for a very reasonable price.  Now there is no reason you should not go.  Next time we are back in Phoenix we will be back to Coup Des Tartes.
