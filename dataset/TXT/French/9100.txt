4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw For a restaurant on the strip, I come here pretty often along with Todd English Olives. I'm usually here for dinner so I can't say much for brunch. Be sure to make a reservation to avoid long waits. Patio seating is great for a view of the Bellagio fountain. I'm usually here for the steak, sea scallops, or mussles. Other things on the menu, I haven't found anything else too impressive yet. The onion soup can be disappointing. Escargot was disappointing. 

The few times I was here for weekend brunch, the food was alright but nothing too memorable. However, I've had cheaper and better brunch off the strip so I don't bother with brunch here.
