gxMa7j1LXIUxxBoP0osDpA Best hidden Montreal gem. I moved from Montreal when I was 24, and I have to say this is hands down my favorite restaurant. It's an amazing byowine place that changes is menu based on what food is in season. Service is amazing, they make you feel like and king and I have never been let down by the food. They even got me into eating baby deer. One thing that is annoying is that certain nights (or all nights) they only take seats at 2 times.
