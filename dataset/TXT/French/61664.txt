sMAgnsqi-eY9LlywVC85Hg The table d'hote was what my whole table ordered, and it was a very decent price for high quality food and pretty good portions.
I myself had the rabbit confit (quite good, first time trying rabbit) and it was a large amount of food with delicious sauce.
The bread was very good although it took awhile for them to reload the basket and by that time I was no longer down for bread, plus they took away my plate without asking if I was finished despite having some food on my plate lol.
The soup of the day and pate appetizers were very good.
The service was excellent, the waiters were very nice and always attending our water.
Overall, 4/5 because they took my food and the food wasn't absolutely amazing but was still a very high quality, would recommend to others if money ain't no problem baby!
