O3OH5IEFMPtz7mPKakPZ3Q I took my daughter here to celebrate her twenties first birthday and everything were very delicious. We ordered edamame truffle oil, rock shrimp, salmon and tuna taco, foie gras, truffle marrow filet, Australian lamb chop, house special soba, house special fried rice and green tea ice cream. My favorite are tuna taco, truffle marrow filet, and Australian lamp chop.
We came back today because we had such a wonderful experience and the food were so good from the first visit but today the food was not good, everything came out a little cold and my favorite truffle marrow filet was a little bit chewy not tender like the last time
