E9HkUYYO_-5vKjvBwLuDIw Great service.  The pistachio crusted honey goat cheese was warm, creamy and delicious.  It was a heavenly bite with warm crusted French bread.  

My filet mignon was grilled rare to perfection. The meat was tender and flavorful.  My husband's pan roasted salmon was tender and juicy. We loved our dinner.  

We ended our meal with an espresso and a rich chocolate mousse with candied Orange shavings.  Phenomenal dessert.
