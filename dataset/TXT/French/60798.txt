SCklYa_jhihWAcfIn-_chg Croissant review... good, but not the best.  Looks like a croissant (not too long, wide).  Good colour.  Medium flake.  Very buttery.

I'll make a note of the relatively inexpensive price ($1.60-something with tax).  Note that I purchased and ate it around 12:30... bodes fairly well because really they should be tested just out of the oven!
