4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I have three words for Mon Ami Gabi: 1.) Perfect 2.) Perfect and 3.) Perfect.  This restaurant on the strip and inside the Paris Hotel & Casino is just perfect. From the extensive cocktail list, the extensive beer list to the assortment of cheeses to the menu of quality French food, you simply cannot lose! If you sit outside on the veranda there is great tourist/people watching and the weather is always sunny in Las Vegas. They also have a vast variety/selection of Bloody Mary's (they used to have a Sunday brunch Bloody Mary Bar).  It's the perfect place for the perfect lunch. Did I mention that it was perfect? Because...it is.
