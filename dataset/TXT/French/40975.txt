kcF-en40P3J9L8nLy5lKqQ I really really enjoy it all here! The product (especially the cold beer), great oysters, great pizza. The staff is.phenomenal from hostess, to bartender to management. 

I have read reviews claiming this place is pretentious, and I disagree. I roll in jeans and a polo shirt. Probably the worst dresser in the place! Everyone else is in ties, or sports jackets, or dresses etc. I have never felt out of place or have been made feel uncomfortable because of my.apparel. Always served with a smile.

Management rocks. Quick to step up and help when staff is in the weeds, and they go above and beyond to right a wrong.

Central bistro is definitely one of my go-to-spots!
