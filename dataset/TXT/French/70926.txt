xBxDMEkFK5GBhiy-8gGE9w Where to start with Brasserie T? 

First of all, the place is modern in style but still warm and welcoming thanks to the wood implemented to the decor. You've probably heard it is small and it is true! But to me, that's one of the positive aspect of the place as you are garantied to be plunged in a great ambiance every time you visit.

Also, the staff is great! They are available but not annoying, they know what they're doing and are altogether responsible for how great the place is!

As for the food, the menu offers traditional french bistro dishes but what you get in your plate has that special Normand Laprise/Charles-Antoine Crete twist to it that makes it stand out!

My meal went as following:

Creme montee aux oeufs de Hareng:

The perfect way to start a meal! A light Creme Fraiche perfectly flavored with hareng eggs. Not too salty and refreshing, especially with a bit of lemon juice sprinkled over it.

Gratin de chevre et pomme-de-terre:

What a great dish! Tasty and fresh Goat cheese served on a moisty potato and leek biscuit topped with an homemade raspberry and beets vinegar that I am still trying to reproduce at home. This starter by itself is a reason to comeback!

Saumon a l'aneth:

The Brasserie T!'s superstar! A fresh sous-vides slow cooked salmon of perfect texture! You can tell by the subtle taste that it was marinated overnight in a oil and maple concoction that makes it melt in your mouth. It comes with a crunchy fenil salad that leaves you asking for more.

The portion are great and the prices are a deal for such quality food (around 100$ for 2 with starters, meals and a glass of wine)! Also, don't forget to try one of their  ''cocktail-of-the-hour''! All made of fresh ingredients and generously portioned, they are guaranteed to add to the "buzz" you'll experience at Brasserie T!

Cheers,
