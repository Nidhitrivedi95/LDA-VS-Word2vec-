rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w one of the nicest restaurants that I've been to.  I opted for the 5 course degustation menu of the potatoe soup with black truffles, foie gras, atlantic cod, and roasted chicken.  Everything was delicious and filling, my favorite of course was the foi gras.  Service is excellent and I treasured the chocolate box they gave us as a gift in the end.
