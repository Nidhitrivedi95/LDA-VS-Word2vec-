7h4nuLjd18da9kg1Qc2rnw I do like this place. I just found it a bit hard to really sink my teeth into. The menu is an array of chicken and steak, with a duck and lamb dish. Decent wine selection, but nothing to get excited about. The place just comes around as a little too generic. It's not really French, not New American, just 'Bistro'. If you are looking for a quiet classy dinner in your neighborhood, it will likely do the trick. I just don't see it as a place you would brag about to your friends.
