XKPosZx2j4RHcZ8Ewdwj0A Great place in Mile End.  Was there for lunch + brunch.  Feels simultaneously upscale, cosmopolitan, and comfortable.  Tough to pull off all three.  Menu is well balanced traditional french dishes without being too rich and fattening.  Chicken and apples special was amazing for lunch.  The omelet at brunch had two simple ingredients: cheese and herbs.  And it was the best omelet ever.  Well-priced wine by the glass list.  A must.
