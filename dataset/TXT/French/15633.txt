6fPQJq4f_yiq1NHn0fd11Q This places is awesome. My sister, My grandma and I were waiting for our guest to arrive here, and while waiting we enjoyed the garlic fries, crepe vendome(?) (which was AMAZING, who knew apples and chicken tasted so good) we had a fruit plate and croissants, sipped on hot chocolate while my grandma and sister drank mimosas. Once our guest arrived we placed our orders with our fabulous waitress and shortly after our food came. Don't remember what my grandma ordered but it was a delicious looking crepe. My sister had the healthy start crepe which she greatly enjoyed, It was a sweet crepe with yogurt, strawberries, bananas, toasted almonds and topped with honey(:  David our guest, had the croissant breakfast sandwich. I had the Belgium waffles with strawberries and cream, maple syrup, and nutella. It was phenomenal. I definitely recommend this place(: food was totally worth the wait, but some items on the menu were a wee pricey,  for example the fruit and cheese sampler was 10 bucks. Yikes!!  But nonetheless this place was amazing and I would highly recommend La Creperie to everyone(:
