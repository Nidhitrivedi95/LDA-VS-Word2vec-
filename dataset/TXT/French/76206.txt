There was alot of people packed here for Sunday Morning so they must be doing something right. I liked the decor and the overall friendliness of everyone. They told us 20 minute wait but we got inside in 10 minutes. Sweet. Their breakfast menu is different from the rest of their regular menu so expect that. 

Ordered Kiche just because you can't just get that anywhere and also the process to cook it takes a while and i know is a little difficult. Anyway didn't like it too much. 

I recommend the Eggs Florentine Breakfast. 
Now that was delicious. Sampling other people's food :) 

You know, now that i think of it, I ordered the 4 cheese( quatre) Kiche and it was ok. The chedder and broccoli kiche tasted better. 

Go try some French food. Go to Mimi's.
