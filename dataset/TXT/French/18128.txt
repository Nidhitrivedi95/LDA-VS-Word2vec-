A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g I stopped by on their last day before their Summer vacation and grabbed about thirty of their macarons.  Love the macarons here, they're fluffier than most places you can buy from in Las Vegas.  

The inside decor from a year ago is completely different also, you can now sit down and enjoy your treats.  I've only been here for their macarons but you can definitely tell from the displayed product that this is a really good French bakery that offers so much more than just macarons.  I just haven't had the chance to walk and pass through the second half of the shop.  I can't wait for them to open up shop again, there aren't too many bakeries that can make macarons as good as Manon!
