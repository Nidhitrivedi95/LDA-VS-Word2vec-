jWUShkhq7Fe3OKr3NvQecQ A group of 8 went here for lunch.  Everyone liked their food ranging from tomato & mozzarella salad, crab Louie salad, chix breast sandwich, pate sandwich, roast beef sandwich, strawberry banana smoothie.  Chef Neal came out & we introduced ourselves.  He has a room svc catering menu which is quite different which he emphatically stated he would deliver to our office, houses, or a party.  He sent out homemade cookies & bread pudding as dessert which were great & I don't usu like br pudding!!!  He also showed us the dinner menu & was extremely hospitable which you don't see much of nowadays in the chain-y atmosphere.  We all thought the prices were value conscious but as soon as he gets super busy, they might get raised!!!
