Oh, and the food was amazng. 

Linda had a lovely BLT that she said was the best she ever had. I had the plain Poutine, which was magnificent. I mean, just plain amazing. It was the best I've had and I've eaten it all over Montreal. The big thing was the gravy, just plain old-fashioned kick ass. And it was cheap enough to handle with the change I had let over from Au Pied de Cochon. 

Magnificent!
