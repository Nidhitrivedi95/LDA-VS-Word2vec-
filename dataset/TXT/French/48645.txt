ohMpNug5zWNxOlL6ShG7Ig The National Concierge Association visited Cafe Bink yesterday and enjoyed a delicious lunch of their award winning French fries, tasty house salad and a tasting of the sandwiches which the group voted the sloppy joe and the roast beef as the favorites.  The group highly recommends Cafe Bink to anyone who finds themselves near Carefree Arizona where the service was just as fantastic as the food.  Thanks for taking care o us.
