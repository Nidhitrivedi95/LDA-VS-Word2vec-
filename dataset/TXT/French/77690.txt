YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g This is just like any other French Cafe joint--the portions are small, the prices are high. While the quality and presentation of the food was incredible, it's not a place for the everyday person to get full off from. If you want to get full off some heavy meat dish or something, don't come here. If you want to try some great food and drinks, then this is a good place to check out.

I remember getting Lobster Mac & Cheese. Pretty good--I'd recommend it. I'd also recommend the Skirt Steak.

The seating area is nice. It's a good place to grab a drink/bite and people watch or hang around in a small group. I wouldn't recommend coming here with a large group. There's also a lot of other great restaurants in the area so shop around before picking.
