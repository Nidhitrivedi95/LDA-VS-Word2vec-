SFnrHuVFSNiondFVUBLJZQ Discovered this awesome place back on my first trip to Montreal in 2008, then went back again this past summer on my second trip up to the city. Both times I ordered the crêpe La Cabane à sucre (consisted of egg, ham, and Quebec maple syrup), and both times, I was not disappointed! I also had the pleasure of taking a few tastes of my brothers cheese fondue, which was also very good, albeit very hot. Definitely do recommend if you find yourself walking through Old City!
