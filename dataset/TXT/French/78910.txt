ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug I've been coming to this restaurant for over 10 years now. This is always our breakfast place. I usually get the omelet, french toast or waffle. Today I tried the ham and cheese sandwich. Instead of a croissant and fried egg I replaced it with a bagel and scrammed eggs and it came with breakfast potatoes. Another great dish.
