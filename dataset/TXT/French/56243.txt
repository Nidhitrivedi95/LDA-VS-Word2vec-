rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Yelp says 3 stars is "A-OK" --- that is what  I would give Bouchon. 

I had 

- French onion soup -- good but nothing truly special
- The croquet -- excellent and unique. The fries were ok, did not live up to the hype of the yelp reviews.
- Pumpkin donuts with vanilla ice cream -- tasty but not something that made me go "wow, these are donuts, really? how did they do that?" --- I expect more wow factor from dessert at a nice place.

So all in all, you will have a nice meal in a casual setting but it's nothing special.
