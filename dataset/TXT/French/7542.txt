4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw We came here in the morning and we really enjoyed ourselves. There was ample seating, so we seated promptly upon arrival. Our waitress was really sweet and the rest of the waitstaff was super attentive too (water was full, staff was always available, etc.). Great service! 

Eggs Florentine - Delicious! I was a big fan of the poached eggs and hollandaise sauce. Also, the hash browns' crispiness hit the spot!

Corned Beef Hash & Poached Eggs - Same yummy poached eggs but with tasty corned beef to accompany the dish. This order came with toast as well as the golden hash browns.

Overall, we had an awesome experience! Relatively speaking, the prices were totally affordable for a restaurant on the strip. I would highly recommend this spot for a chill place to grub for breakfast!
