4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw TEN stars out of 5!!!!  This place was awesome!  We came here on a Thursday night around 9pm, so there was no wait at all.  Plus, it was Dec. 18th, which I guess is historically one of the slowest times in Vegas.  Anyway, our server went ahead and gave some recommendations for entrees and man, am I glad I went with his suggestions!  My husband and I both ordered the filet with Merlot butter reduction.  I am not even joking, this is most likely the best meal I have ever had in my life.  The filet was PERFECT.  Super tender, moist, and absolutely delicious when coupled with the merlot sauce!  The super thin fries are really interesting.  We also shared a plate of garlic spinach (which, btw, was definitely big enough for 2 to share) which was quite tasty.  For dessert, we got the chocolate mousse which was also excellent!  The service was great.  Our server offered for us to have a taste of the wine we were considering buying a bottle of....and that was indeed a great idea since we liked it a lot and bought the bottle.  

Ambiance is very nice and you can't beat an evening view of the Bellagio fountains!  We sat inside right by the window.  We couldn't hear the music when the fountain show was on, but oh well.  That's a very minor drawback.  

Overall, it was absolutely fabulous.  Next time we're in Vegas, we are definitely coming back here!
