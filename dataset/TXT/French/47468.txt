O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q I swear I've reviewed this place before!  Shame on me!

This is my hands down, favorite place for Breakfast/Brunch in Vegas.  I will come here from across the whole strip if I have to.  Between ambiance (sitting outside on the patio), to the impeccable service I always receive, to the food deliciousness, I would give this place 6 stars if I could.

I get the Croque Madam with Frites, pretty much every time I come here and it has never disappointed.  Melt in your mouth buttery bread, delicious Mornay(sp?) sauce and a beautifully fried egg on top. *drool*

I've come with someone new every time so far and always begged for a taste of their food so I can make sure Morels is not just a one hit wonder.  So far so good, everything I've had is delicious.  This time around, my buddy got the Salmon Eggs Benedict and it was phenomenal.

If you are searching for Breakfast/Brunch, do yourself a favor and come here...ask for a table on the patio if it is available and weather is permitting.


I will be back every trip.
