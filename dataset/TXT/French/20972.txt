AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw This place is beautiful!!  Beautiful pastries everywhere, as pretty as Jean Phillipe pastries.

Ordered crepe supreme, cuban press sandwich and opera cake.

Crepe supreme ($11.00): buckwheat crepe filled with chicken and mushrooms smothered in a mornay sauce.  I guess I don't like wheat when it comes to crepe.  The chicken has a weird smell and I don't care for its sauce.  The sauce is too thick yet very bland. I couldn't even eat half of it.

Cuban press sandwich ($10.00): shaved lean roasted pork loin, provolone cheese, pickles, dijon, mojo marinade on ciabatta bread.  The meat is good but for some reason I don't really care for it.  I usually love cuban sandwich.

Opera cake ($7.00): good but slightly too sweet and heavy.  It's almost like eating full cream instead of airy mousse.  I prefer Jean Phillipe's pastries because I don't feel guilty eating them since it's so airy and not too sweet.

What is that noise?  I saw everyone was staring at the clock.  I was leaving but I had to know what that was. 
Clock guy: Don't go away!!
MC: *I heard: go away* what?
Clock guy: It's coming
MC: What's coming?
Clock guy: The chocolate?
MC: For me?
Clock guy: yes, free chocolate.

Thanks clock guy.  I got a box of yummylicious truffle inside a cute box.  It's so delicious and I detected happy hour inside the box.

The service is not friendly except the clock guy.  You really need to smile and say thank you and please do not run over your customers who are waiting in line.  Yes, you did it twice, monsieur.

QUICK TIP: THE GRANDFATHER CLOCK DISPENSES FREE TRUFFLE AT REGULAR INTERVALS THROUGHOUT THE DAY.

2 stars!!

Payard Patisserie & Bistro has yummylicious truffle.
