E9HkUYYO_-5vKjvBwLuDIw This is a fabulous new restaurant! French bistro at it's best. The steak, "shepard's pie", beet salad, and French onion soup were amazing....and the chocolatemousw... Spectacular! I look forward to going back. The service and personal graciousness from owners were a nice touch too. Prices and wine selection were a welcome surprise. French restaurants are often expensive, but this bistro was great. Thank you!
