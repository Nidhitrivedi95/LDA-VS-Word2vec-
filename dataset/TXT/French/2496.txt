0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g Amazing food but I felt a little out of place.

We made reservations and were sat promptly. The restaurant had a very formal feel to it and the overall noise level was low. When we were sat at the table for 2 we felt too far apart and I would need to speak uncomfortably loud in order to have a conversation with my date. I requested a new table and was moved to a much nicer one for 4 were we could sit next to each other.  

We ordered one of each tasting menus with both supplements for the evening, she had the lobster and I had the filet. A nice bottle of wine + tip set us back $600

Expensive but this will go down as one of the best meals I've ever had. Everything about the food was beyond perfect, we cleaned every plate brought out to us. Nom Nom :)

We were easily the youngest people there by 20 years, I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to those seeking a fun atmosphere. Well decorated yes, lively no. However, if your passionate about food and are willing to spend what its worth then Picasso will not disappoint you.
