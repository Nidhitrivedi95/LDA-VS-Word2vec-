fFInb4Dl2Ix4iE-VOltbkQ Went to Montreal for a long weekend with my sister and were fortunate to stay at the Hotel Nelligan. We enjoyed an amazing dinner at Verses the second night we were in town. The service was amazing, couldn't have asked for anything better.  Our server Luc was very attentive and amidst courses gave us great recommendations for our next day of adventures. David, the sommelier had great wine recommendations and made us feel right at home. The food could also not be beat. We both loved the red tuna entree and the chocolate mousse is not to be missed. 

We enjoyed Verses so much that we went back on our third night in town to enjoy dessert, great wine and fabulous service. Don't miss this place on your trip to Montreal!
