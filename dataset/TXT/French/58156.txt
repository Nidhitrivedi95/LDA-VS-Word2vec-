rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Yeah, no. Bouchon in Vegas was one of the worst dining experiences I've had in the city of sin.  The service was okay, but the food just wasnt there and I'm not even comparing it to Per Se or the Laundry.  It just wasnt good.  But I guess if you're in town and you feel like splurging or you just have to be in a Keller restaurant, go for it.  I'd think twice though.
