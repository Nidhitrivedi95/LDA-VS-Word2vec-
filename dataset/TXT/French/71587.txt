XcWlBj5oQgzKhR7Cxovj3w I was at Sky Harbor for a layover so I decided to stop and get something to eat due to my flight being delayed. I stopped at Zinc. I was greeted by a hostess and sat at a table with a view of Phoenix. I was told I was looking at Camelback Mnt in the distance. I ordered a nice glass of wine and the Pork Belly appetizer that was recommended by my server.  It was wonderful!!! The restaurant was clean and friendly. I was there in the late morning/early afternoon. I have read a few of the other reviews from other customers before I decided to post this. I understand that this is a new location at the airport, however, I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of food and service that I received. I hope to have a reason to return to Phoenix to enjoy another meal or snack there. I guess it may be luck of the draw as far as the time of day you visit. As for me, I was very happy with my choice to stop there!!! Hope others have as good of an experience as I did. Good Job Zinc!!
