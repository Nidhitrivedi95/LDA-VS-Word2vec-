XcWlBj5oQgzKhR7Cxovj3w What a great experience! My flight on Southwest was delayed so I searched for some liquid courage and found Zinc. Was able to get a seat at the bar had a FABULOUS waiter. I don't remember his name but he was tall and talking about triathlons. 
I ordered a Rose and a pork belly sandwich - absolute heaven in an airport. I can't wait to fly again and hope to be delayed! (Not really.)
