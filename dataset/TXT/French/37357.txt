j0baDQfMAGDm_QGdFMmb-Q PARIS in Scottsdale! All I can say is "MAGNIFIQUE"! We went there last night with a groupon. The service was excellent from start to finish! The food was excellent. The warm fresh bread with the creamy garlic aioli sauce was to die for. I couldn't stop eating it. We also had the mushroom tart appetizer which was really good. OHHH..the sole and the mussels were my favorite. Mmmmm...then the bread pudding. Everything in here reminded me of when I was in Paris. I am definitely coming back to this hidden gem.
