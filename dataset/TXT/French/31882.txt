gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA The view is great! Food and wine list are excellent. As you know I only give 5 starts to restaurants with exceptional menu, vegetarian menu and wine list.  
We had the tasting menu (they have a vegetarian option too) I loved it! And the wine...... Loved the wine! 
We even received a nice email asking if we had enjoy our experience! Definitely will me back!
