ynwARDp7X2fi6hk9XCOSNQ I think that the confusion here is that there is a restaurant called Chez Queux on this spot, and during the tourist season they add an outdoor seating area, but for some reason that area is treated as a separate restaurant - they have a different menu, which does include nachos - that's my theory.

That outside place is called (by them) La Cave - I think.

That way the established restaurant adds a pop up area just for tourists - with a menu aimed at them (us).

Anyway, you can't beat the outdoor location during summer tourist season... perfect for a cold brew and listen to the outdoor musicians....

My wife and I had smoked salmon salads and they were really good with loads of salmon - they were under 14$ and I suspect part of the "real" restaurant's menu; so lesson here: good salads.

Also had a pitcher of a good local Canadian red beer for under 17$ - so that's also reasonable on a tourist area.

The outside seating area is on the Jacques-Chartier plaza, which is a great space to watch people and performers... the "real" restaurant kitty-corners the plaza.
