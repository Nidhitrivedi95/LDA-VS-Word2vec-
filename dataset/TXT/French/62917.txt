SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA My parents are regulars here and this is their favorite place to eat in Cleveland. I went with them one night to celebrate my dad's birthday. The menu is delicious (not literally but figuratively) and I want to keep coming back so I can try everything. 

We ended up with the mussels with frites for an appetizer. They were fresh and meaty. For the main meal I had the scallops (because whenever I see scallops on a menu, I must try them). They were well seared and done perfectly. The accompaniments of brussel sprouts, and noodles with pernod cream was perfect. My mom had the veal short rib which was decadent. Dad had steak frite but substituted for mashed potatoes.

If it's your first time there then order the cheese plate. It is an experience I truly enjoyed and was the perfect ending to an amazing meal. 

The space is intimate and busy but also polite.
