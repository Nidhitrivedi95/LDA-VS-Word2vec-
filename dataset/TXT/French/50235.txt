ovtlrcsVRlgZZQUlHs_ovw My wife and I live in the neighborhood and would eat and drink at the Vogue quite regularly. The drinks are amazing, as well as be bartender. I believe the only reason I will be revisiting the Vogue is because of the bartender, her martinis are very well done. The Oyster Rockefeller was once my favorite appetizer there; baked just right, perfectly cheesy with not too much spinach dressing... I don't understand what went wrong these last few times we visited. Could it be because the change of restaurant ownership?, Because the Oyster's were completely different... mounds of spinach filler and no Oyster, I literally had to get up and visit the restroom so I could pick the spinach out of my teeth. The hamburgers were once the BEST in the West, but have now become mediocre at best. I have heard rumors that the original owner's opened up a restaurant somewhere in the city. If anyone has information on where this restaurant is located I would really appreciate knowing. 

Overall: The restaurant has changed, the food is not as great as it used to be. The drinks are still fantastic and I would highly recommend any of the martini's or bourbon drinks, the entrées not so much.
