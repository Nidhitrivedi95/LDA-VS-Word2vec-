Yp9w4nhUowBU_IS_StFXbQ The food was a solid 4 maybe 4.5 stars but our service was... well we really didn't have any. Delightful greeting and he did take our order in good time. But then we were abandoned. We begged for a tea refill by flagging down another server. We could not get the check and our server never returned after our brunch was served. To add insult we noticed hot beignets being sent to tables at the end of service. We inquired of the maitre de on the way out and he seemed surprised we were not offered any. To his credit he offered to pack up some to go, but we were over it by this time. 
   A pretty place and the food was very nicely done, but at $50 a pop per person for brunch you ought to be able to get a refill on the ice tea.
