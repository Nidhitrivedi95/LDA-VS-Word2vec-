eJ9L40jm5VOXCIq7xs9kQw Excellent French cuisine in old Montreal. Very elegant and classy atmosphere with excellent service from the staff and tasty food. I ordered the foie gras as an appetizer and lamb as my entree. You can literally feel the love poured into every dish by the chef and I was very impressed. 

Also, a plus is there's some good looking workers at the restaurant. ;)
