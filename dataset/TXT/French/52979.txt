QeFsIMcIFIJcOrpthYL8jg This was a really cool restaurant. It has lots of different rooms, a bar, and live music every night (which runs from 7pm to close).  The food was very good - I had the Table D'Hote consisting of a peach salad, a halibut and grilled octopus dish, and a key lime pie dessert. All were excellent, although the halibut was a touch dry (the octopus more than made up for it).  Service was friendly and fast. They have two seatings, with the second starting at 9pm (at least on a Thursday night).

Since we came as a business group hoping to talk, the live music was a bit of a distraction. It was a bit on the loud side, even though we were in a side room (and not in the room with the stage). I think they pumped the music through speakers to other rooms. So, be warned that if you are coming to have a quiet chat, the music may be distracting.
