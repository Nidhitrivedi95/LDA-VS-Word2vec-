zqNgwQjj0_XAll-neGikIw Very cute French cafe. The decor draws you in, but the food will keep you coming back. They import their grains from France  and the owner/chef is from France as well. There is indoor or outdoor seating. They have a pastry bar with quite a few unique selections! I got the Eggs Florentine, but had a hard time choosing because they also offer regular Eggs Benedict and Eggs Royal (crab cakes.) 

Wow! What a delicious meal! Everyone at my table was impressed with their food. Plus, the prices were reasonable! I will defiantly note this one down to eat at again. They had organic options, and they are vegetarian friendly, but it was a shame there wasn't any advertised vegan options. We left with an ice latte and a smile on our face.

* They had an inviting self serve water station, and one unisex restroom*
