gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA If you really want to spoil yourself come eat at Alize. They're located at the top of the Palms Casino. The service was awesome, we felt like ballers! LOL The food...gosh, I don't even know where to start. My bff and I both ordered the lamb duo -- I think my eyes rolled to the back of my head once or twice. LOL it was so good. The guys ordered two diferrent cuts of steak, which they both enjoyed. The wine, food, service and ambiance was well worth the money we paid. All together about $100 per person =)
