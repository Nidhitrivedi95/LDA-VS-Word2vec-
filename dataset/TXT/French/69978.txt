woZ0nUuv4JCfvGtv3KBg_w We found ourselves in North Queensferry around lunch time and had the choice between a hotel bar and the wee restaurant. Without knowing anything about it, we chose the wee restaurant. 
When we walked in it was obvious we were slightly underdressed (it's a tablecloth kinda place...) but the waitress had a spot for us. We were sat down in the side room, a small room with only two tables. I wouldn't recommend it, because it felt a little bit awkward being able to overhear the other group so well. The tables in the main restaurant were all booked unfortunately. 
We looked at the lunch menu and we astounded by how expensive it was (£17,50 for two courses, the evening menu would have been 2 courses for £28,50). That wasn't really our idea of a quick lunch! As we already sat down, we felt we just had to suck it up and enjoy it as much as possible.
We decided to order a two course lunch, with a starter and a dessert (we weren't that hungry). I spotted the word truffle on the menu and had to choose the mushroom truffle soup. It was delicious but a very large portion compared to my boyfriend's starter. He had a goat cheese parcel, which was nice, but nothing amazing.
I had a cheese board as a dessert, which was really nice. My boyfriend had a pannecota was nice as well.
The service was fine, but for a place with these prices i would expect a little more from them!
All in all, I would love to score this place four stars if only it wasn't so bloody expensive!
