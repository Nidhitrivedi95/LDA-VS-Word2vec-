XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q Best food I have ever had, I thought I was having an out of body experience! I never have had an opportunity to have a truly gourmet meal like this but I got to go for free. If you are paying I think it is worth the ~$400 for a once in a lifetime experience. The bread cart is beyond description.
