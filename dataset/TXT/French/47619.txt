O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q Quiet at brunch but the food, coffee, and service were above average. My girlfriend liked it even more than I did.

French toast with banana and mascarpone on brioche was excellent and well presented.

Crap benedict would have been perfect if the crab flavors came out a little more. I would order it again. Maybe try the traditional benedict.

Coffee - From Rwanda. Very good!

Prices weren't obscene. $18 a plate. $5 coffee...

OH! I didn't try it because I saw it on the way out, but they have a bloody mary cart the waiter can bring buy and create to taste. Gonna try it next time.

Went back for a snack later in the day. The ceviche tased like rubber fish/shrimp in salsa w/ sage (wtf?). But the oysters, cheese, wine and service all rocked!
