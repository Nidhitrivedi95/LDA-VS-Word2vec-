mnn--vaYHtNyBNYFYBFIog Our evening at Toque was good and memorable but not the best meal or service I've ever had by far. We both ordered the 7 course tasting menu with wine flights. 

There were some outstanding courses: the rabbit with pasta, the foie gras, razor scallops with mushrooms. My mouth is watering just thinking about the rabbit. But the service was off. Our main waitress was competent enough but several of the food runners did not have a good enough grasp of English to describe the dishes. This should not happen at a 5 star restaurant in a bilingual city. The staff who deals with customers should speak both of those languages fluently. There is a level of service at fine dining restaurants that I did not feel Toque met. It was no one thing but the entire evening. It was a fine evening but at $420 for two, not one that will be repeated.
