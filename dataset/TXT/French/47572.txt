O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q This great steakhouse and fish restaurant is located on the Casino Level of the Venetian. It was a real hit.  Even though it was super busy and we had not booked the Maitre D found us a table and we were speedily brought waters and menus. We ordered Oysters to start and they were superb, fresh and served with Lemons, Horseradish and Vinegar. We all ordered steaks for mains and they were also superb with a great selection of NY strip, Filet, T bones and Rib Eye which had the perfect Marble and aged just right.

They had a nice selection of deserts and coffees and it was a really enjoyable experience.  Highly recommended and we will definitely be back next year!
