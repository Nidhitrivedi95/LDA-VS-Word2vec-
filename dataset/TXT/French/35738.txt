I cannot recommend the sampler enough, it left me wanting more of everything that I had tried, but at the end of the night I still left full. The lobster poutine was good, just really not worth trying when there are so many other things on the menu. I would recommend the smoked salmon, ahí tuna, the mussels, and of course the espresso shot.
