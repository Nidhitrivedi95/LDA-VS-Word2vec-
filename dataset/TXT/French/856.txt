_cjPEH9wXhKS-HQe_U3M4Q Everybody mention Le Select as a brunch place. We went there for dinner and here what we've ordered: cheese plate and steak were good but the mussels (must admit that Le Select was recommended by BlogTO as a place to have them) were oversalted, sause was weird and mussels should be served in a big metal bowl not in a plate. And fries...well, strange. So we had quite a controversial experience. Atmosphere was lovely but I consider this place is way too overpriced.
