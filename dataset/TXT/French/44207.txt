ME6D5nLlfG0xZCtICOYDuw We truly thought we were on a candid camera joke show. I've never written a bad Yelp review but just HAVE to for this place. 

The most BIZZARE and horrible dining experience my family has ever had. After 90 minutes of no appetizers, we realized only 1/3 of our order was placed to begin with. The "manager" told my mom and grandma their lobster pasta orders were out of stock then never brought them menus to reorder and played dumb 25 minutes later when we asked. We never saw our waiter after our drinks arrived. The only appetizer to hit the table was an order of 6 grilled oysters with 2 of the oyster shells coming EMPTY. They acted like we were a burden when we asked where our food was 2 hours later. 

When we decided to go across the street to Del Frisco's (Which was amazing) the "manager" said "you should go there if you want to" and told us to "not penalize our server" who we hadn't seen since 7:30PM when we sat. It was laughable and there are some serious issues going on there.
