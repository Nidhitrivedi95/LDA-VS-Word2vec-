BXx77WXfoAQaJnQuHquhCw The atmosphere at Patachou is both chic and welcoming; un vrai petit cafe Francais!  Which is welcome if you've been missing wonderful chocolate croissant from Montreal (like the ones at the patisserie from the train station? Right. I'm fussy.)  It's tricky to find quality French bakeries like Patachou in Toronto - they do exist, but you have to search diligently. And eat. You know, in the name of purity.  I'd go on at length, but I think Erwin M, Matthew S., & Kat F. have said everything you need to know croissant-wise! 

As your family goes, Patachou is definitely bustling . But don't worry, it's a large space -  somewhat unusual for a cafe-bakery where you'd normally expect to be squashed up next to the three other tables or shoved up against the door.  Not here! Nanny Erin dropped by on a Monday afternoon - and while there was a steady stream of traffic, she reported that everyone seemed perfectly happy with a place to relax and reading material on hand  (of which they keep plenty). Translation: no fighting for a seat while you're paying with one eye and keeping the other on your giggly toddler about to make a break for the door.  (And there's also a covered patio if sauna weather doesn't have you breathing fire).

Speaking of toddlers: Erin tells me "les enfants sont acceuillis a Patachou!" Ok, yes, she totally said it in English. But how often do I get to speak French out here?  Basically, Patachou
loves kids. Their selection of baked goods, soups and 
sandwiches should please even the pickiest eater. And you may even convince a little widening of your kidlet repertoire when your little ones take a peek at the tempting French delights. 

A little bit more Extraordinary Patachou:

-Choose from a selection of healthy juices (adults & kids alike)
-Croissants are available to bring home in larger
quantities for your freezer - to bake at home!  (yes please!)
-A selection of ready-made meals is also available. So when you've had one-of-those-days, you can have one-of-their-meals.
