4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw After listening to a friend rave about Mon Ami Gabi I decided to get a group of friends together to see what all the fuss was about.

I called about 2 weeks in advance to make a reservation, they explained that it wouldn't be a problem and that everyone must be there to be seated. HIGHLY RECOMMEND MAKING A RESERVATION. 

Their menu is brief but lots of good choices and their wine and alcohol menu had great choices as well. They start you off with large baguettes and butter also comes with this magnificent pickled beet spread. I ordered their French onion soup and warm goat cheese salad. The soup was very good but had TONS of cheese and the salad was also very good. Everyone else I was with ordered some sort of steak and all of their plates were cleaned off. 

The bill came to $230 for seven people including alcoholic drinks and an appetizer. It was a great place for a group dinner and very reasonable for the price.
