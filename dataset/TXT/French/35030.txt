So its a no brainer to have a sophisticated French restaurant as well. As soon as you walk in theres a bar on the left side, walk a little futher and you'll find the hostess to greet you. My party was already there when I arrived, and she immediately knew who I was waiting for. I walked right in and found my friends. Amazing service and food. We ordered salmon tartar with creme freche, skate with string beans, platter of cheeses, house red wine, and the burger. The salmon tartar was to die for! Clean, light, and very fresh. The skate is a white fish that was cooked in butter laid on top of a bed of string beans. It was light, except for all the butter, and satisfying. The cheeses were great as well, I can't remember exactly what we had on the plate. The burger I didn't try, but the fries are good. House red wine, was just okay not bad. It definitely didn't hurt that some things were comped. ;) And an amazing view of the strip to boot.

Over all experience, I love the new casino, so many things to see and play with. Great array of restaurants to choose from. I plan on coming back many times in the future! :)
