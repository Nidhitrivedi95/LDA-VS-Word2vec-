kGOr_D-LNpgZ2M9N8TT4QQ I've come here once before, 1 or 2 years ago, and could not have been more disappointed by how downhill this restaurant has gone ever since on my most recent visit. First of all, we had reservations for a table at 8:30pm, and we were seated over an hour later. The manager, or manager-on-duty did check in on us a few times at the bar. Of all the things he could offer us hungry, empty-stomached guests, he decided to offer us a round of shots at the bar. Shots on an empty stomach! Yay! 

When we finally did get our seats, and we went through the menu, we were told my our waiter that 50% of the items were not available anymore (ran out of ingredients). OK maybe I exaggerate, but a lot of the items that we had wanted were sold out. 

I got the seafood bouillabaisse which hit the spot for a cold winters night. I had ordered a seafood bouillabaisse the previous weekend at a Collingwood restaurant and could not help but compare the two. La Societe's version was supposed to have a lobster broth, but the taste was too light and watered down. And for $30, I didn't think it was really worth it. 

It was my friend's birthday, so the waiter brought us dessert with a candle on it. Most restaurants would give a free birthday dessert, especially if they F things up really badly from the get-go. But ohh no, La Societe does not disappoint. They decided to charge us for the dessert. How low can you go? Very low apparently. Oh La Societe, you've gone down on my "Never-Returning-Not-Even-If-You-Paid-Me" List'.
