pmoIMK8zGWvKsVOPDBYfzg went here a few weeks ago and it was great. only issue was we went to the bar 1st and they had a 2-1 drink special. they transfered these drinks to our dinner tab which was what they wanted but they didnt give us the 2-1 on these drinks. not major but just annoying. i blame this on the bar. so i wouldnt recommend the bar but the resturaunt was fricken awesome. we loved each dish.
