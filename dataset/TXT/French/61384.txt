SJo_IjvzdRtCvZVN0cbrRQ Amazing place. Best kept secret in town. I have visited many times. Everyone is so friendly and they always find a way to seat us quickly. Last time I was there I ordered the hash and it was awesome, so tasty. I have never absolutely never been disappointed at the blue door. The croissants are so light, flaky and huge. A new favorite I have found is the hot cider. It is perfect on a cold winter morning. My family came to visit from out of state and they told me they want to come to the blue door every time they visit. Keep up the great work!
