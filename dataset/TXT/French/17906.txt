A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g Coming to Patisserie Manon has now become a tradition. My husband and I come here and order a baguette sandwich with turkey, ham, butter and cheese, a small side of the split pea soup, and a drink and it comes out to around $9! Did I mention the sandwich is huge? We usually split half and save half for later. The split pea soup is really great, has a nice smokey flavor. 
The desserts are absolutely phenomenal. We have tried the eclairs, the macarons, the cronut, and a variety of other things. We have not been disappointed once. The atmosphere is very nice and relaxing. The store and tables are always clean. The service is great. And all of the workers wear little red hats, super cute.
This place is just great! 
We can always count on this place to deliver great food and service 100% of the time.
