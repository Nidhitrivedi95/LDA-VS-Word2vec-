-Mz3M0g6iFZczs6a7ddf5g I ate here in Montreal with several of my colleagues. The place was difficult to find with only a barber pole marking its entrance but the food was worth the search! It claims to be a fusion of Japanese and Italian but really sushi was the only Asian item on the menu. Regardless, the motto of the restaurant is "we have the best diners because people find us"   And it truly live up to that!
