YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g Definitely the best place to enjoy lunch at Mandalay Bay!  The atmosphere is more relaxed and casual than it was before, the service was good and the food was excellent.  The portions were pretty small, but perfect for lunch.  I enjoyed the halibut and the others in my party enjoyed their lunch as well.
