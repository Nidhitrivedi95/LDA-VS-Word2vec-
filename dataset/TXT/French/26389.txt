D7CnTsm8SCmbQghz1ioPdw Wonderful restaurant for venison and really dope interior. Came here with a bachelor party, although in truth this place is much more suited for a classy event or a date! The wait staff didn't seem to mind us though, which was nice. We managed to down many bottles of wine, try lots of shared appetizers (I remember any and all tartar being delicious), and ate some delicious entrees, although what they were escapes me now. Yeah, I would love to go back!
