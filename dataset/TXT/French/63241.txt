SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA My singing partner & I had just finished playing a set at the Barking Spider and were ravenous. A friend led us over to L'Albatros (around the block), saying only that it was pricey but good. He was only half correct: for the type, quality and even quantity of food it was quite reasonable (especially since I'm used to Chicago prices); but the service was friendly and knowledgeable and the food was amazing.  Despite some tempting specials and a full bistro-classics menu, i zeroed in on the choucroute garnie.  It was every bit the equal (and then some) of any I'v had in Paris or Montreal. Huge, meltingly succulent slab of pork belly, generous cut of a subtly smoked pork chop (not at all salty), boudin blanc and andouille sausages on a bed of cabbage braised in a gentle savory broth that with a touch more saffron could have been the basis for bouillabaisse.  My singing partner had the grilled sausage platter. I went old-school (match the regions) and paired the choucroute with a crisp yet full rosé Cremant d'Alsace. Dessert was a dish of impeccably fresh blackberries, strawberries and raspberries  with a generous dollop of creme fraixche. Partner had excellent coffee and a dried-cherry-and-walnut brownie that was sort of like a Teenage Mutant Ninja Chunky."

It was the perfect capper to a satisfying gig and two-week tour. Will definitely be back.
