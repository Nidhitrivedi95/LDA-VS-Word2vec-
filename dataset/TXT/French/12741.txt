The only time she came to our table without us calling her was when she was collecting the payment. The server wasn't able to give us a recommendation on wines. She seemed like she had absolutely no knowledge on wines and when asked for a recommendation, she told us to look at the wine list and pick any because all the wines listed were "good" to her. We ordered scallops and steak frites. Scallops were heavenly but the steak was just okay. If I go back to this restaurant, it would be because of their scallops. We got a table for 2 by the wall and it was too tiny to fit two dishes, wines, and waters. I almost burned myself, trying to get water, with the candles that they put on the table. This restaurant was too pricey for the service and the portion of the food that we got. Tip: If possible, make a reservation beforehand. We had a reservation and got there a little early for dinner so there was no wait but when we left, there was a long line outside.
