j0baDQfMAGDm_QGdFMmb-Q I don't think I have enough stars to rate the new owner/ chef Jean Christophe! Last night we celebrated my husband's 50 th birthday!  I had vaguely mentioned his love for foie gras and had asked if they could make something with that in mind!  I have to say I was blown away at how thoughtful and creative the meal was!!! And mind blowing delicious !!  They even made a cake ( I had not even requested one I thought we would put a candle on a slice of something sweet) , a mouthwatering cake!!! And they remembered details of what we like.  I am very thankful! Thank you to Jean Christophe and Segolene!  We always love eating there but last night was very special!!
