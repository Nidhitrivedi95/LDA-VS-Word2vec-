61NneTSX9CQXftuKmczyMg I love the mount pleasant strip! This restaurant is SUPER pricey but it's so good. Every once and a while I'll pull over to the side of the road just to pick-up a muffin to enjoy on my ride up to Richmond Hill. The owners are amazingly welcoming people which is so hard to find in the City now. They put their clientele. Check out the bank-vault in the back - it's such a treat!
