SFnrHuVFSNiondFVUBLJZQ I stayed in Montreal for a weekend and stopped in at Chez Suzette for breakfast before heading back to Toronto.  It was cold and snowy outside so I had start with the French onion soup.  I also had an amazing breakfast crepe!

The onion soup was so good!  The thick layer of cheese on top looked and tasted great!  The soup was perfectly season and the onion wasn't overpowering like some onion soups are.

Even though the onion soup was good, the crepe was even better!  The picture I attached doesn't do it justice because the inside was packed full of cheese, egg, ham, and bacon!  Each bite was full of each of these ingredients and the maple syrup topped it all off.

This restaurant was amazing.  The food was to die for and the service was super friendly.  If I ever find myself in Montreal again I'm definitely going to be coming back for another delicious (and horribly filling) breakfast!
