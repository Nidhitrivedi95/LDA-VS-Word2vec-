3uC7Lbc3RgUDTWQlBu4PqQ Quick service. Decent offerings of a typical french bakery.

Located near the venetian theatre under the esculators to the food court. Its pretty easy to find.

There was a line but it moves super fast. Coffee was hot. Croissants ordered were good. For one medium coffee and two croissants the total price was $11.75. Not bad. Most items start at $3.75 each to about $4.50. Thats decent pricing for right on the strip. I visited a few cafes and it was about the same price for something a bit more plainer. My almond croissant was a tad too sweet for my liking but I find american establishments over do the sugar in every dish.

Its a to go kind of establishment but theres seating in the nearby venetian casino food court or the food court in the grand canals shoppes.

They have breakfast croissant and a coffee special for $10.95.

They have giant macaroons too. For $3.50 each.  

Its a decent place for a quick snack or a easy breakfast if you are staying in the palazzo or venetian. Fast and ussually under $10 bucks a person.
