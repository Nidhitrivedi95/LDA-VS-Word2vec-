mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q It's been a while, but I meant to give this place a great review after my most recent trip to Vegas a couple of months ago.  The food is stellar.  I still dream of La Langoustine.  The toasted poppy seeds added so much depth and complexity to what was already a sophisticated dish.  People sitting around us at the bar tried to bribe/coerce every new person who ordered the dish into sharing it with them.

There's a ton of overpriced food in Vegas (Michael Mina's disappointing seafood restaurant down the hall, for example), but L'Atelier is the real deal.
