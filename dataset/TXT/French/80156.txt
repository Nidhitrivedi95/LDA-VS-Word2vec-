This little greasyspoon lunch counter has some of the tastiest burgers in the city, and while they're closer in size to sliders, the price is perfectly right whether you want to have one or two. They also make great tofu and fish burgers, too.

Of course, no greasyspoon is complete without good fries, and their julien fries are some of the best in the city. I'd suggest trying your choice of one or two burgers with the fries/salad plate, but upgrading the fries to a poutine is a pretty solid idea, too. 

There are a number of other French Canadian classics on the menu, ranging from shepherd's pie to (all day) greasy breakfast, that are all worth trying, so return visits are highly recommended if you're really high quality diner fare.

The only challenge is that seating is very limited, so you might want to consider takeout if you mind waiting a few minutes for a spot.
