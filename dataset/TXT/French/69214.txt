w2tr0PA0b3tg8pId0kjM-A When I stepped into the store, I was pretty excited because the desserts looked amazing. However, in a city where competition of baked goods is pretty hardcore, I felt that Gaby Et Jules under-performed. Not to mention, it was expensive.

Macarons:
My opinion of a good macaron, although may well be misplaced, is good texture and pronounced, vibrant flavors. While they had good texture, I felt the flavor was pretty bland. I enjoy floral flavors and hoped to smell and taste the rose, earl grey, etc. Instead, I felt like I just had a plain, sweet macaron with maybe an afterthought of flavor. If I have to sit in my seat, squinting my already tiny eyes, focusing on the flavor, that's not a good macaron in my opinion. Nonetheless, they were okay macarons and if it were just for these, the place would've gotten a 3 stars.

French Baguette:
I was extremely unimpressed with the baguette. While my girlfriend and I were getting the macarons for our expensive study break, the person working there spoke on about how they imported the flour from France and so on. In all honesty, they were kinda pushy with trying to get you to buy more than what you intend to buy. Anywho, I caved in because... bread... those seductive carbs.

Begin my rant here: doesn't matter what country your flour is from, it's not like American flour is inferior. "Yay! Let's all hate on American stuff" - every hipster ever. It's about the protein content, how well it's processed, and baking techniques (requiring experience and patience). TONS of bakeries in Pittsburgh use "American flour" and make amazing bread. Please don't use "we use French flour" as a selling point if the technique and final product is extremely tough, tears at the roof of your mouth, and interior is deflated and dry. End rant.

Overall, lesson learned. I went here because it was close to where I was working and hours were open late. Next time, I will plan ahead and drive to my favorite bakeries further out.
