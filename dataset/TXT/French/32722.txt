h_ypoQ2rmwX8UGSmohsGiQ Went here on Tuesday, July 19 at 1145 am with my brother as it was the anniversary of our mothers death. I got a drink and a chicken Dijon baguette. The baguette which was over $9 with taxes, was not as good as other items I've had there before. And would recommend going to brioche doree for better options. I meant to go back in and get us chocolate cookies when we were done as they're actually amazing. However we were sitting on their patio and got kicked off. My brother was eating a burrito bowl due to dietary restrictions and we sat at the far table away from everyone. The short stubby guy came out after we had been there fifteen minutes and told us to leave immediately in a very rude manner due to my brother not having purchased from there. I myself being a paying customer didn't understand why he was making a big deal considering there were many seats left and no one was looking at us. I highly doubt anyone would have dropped their Maman products to run for a burrito bowl because they saw him eating one. He didn't even say sorry that he was asking and instead stood there until we gathered ourselves to go. We both work in the financial district and will be sure to tell coworkers to not come here based on management and their inability to assess scenarios properly. Their patio is cut off by the rest of the food court by a plant. It would be like going to Starbucks patio. I know it's within their right to ask us to leave but halfway through our meal and in the middle of a serious and emotional conversation was NOT the time. Have some decency and stop being so uptight. Will not long support this establishment and their lack of customer service.
