aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw Bouchon Bakery is a little coffee and bakery kiosk inside The Venetian. It took a while to find this place inside hotel's casino level, because the directions were not exactly clear. Anyway, it was worth the scavenger hunt to find this little treasure. 

The pastries and coffees are a little on the pricey side; but hey, it's Las Vegas! Delicious, flaky, buttery Chocolate Croissants. The Macaroons are just as heavenly too. They're light, airy, and not uber sweet. The coffee is on the strong side. 

Well, I can see why Bouchon Bakery is a Foodie destination on the Las Vegas Strip. It's worth it to stop by to grab a little something to munch on while hotel hopping.
