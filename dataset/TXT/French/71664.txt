XcWlBj5oQgzKhR7Cxovj3w I decided to have the crepes for breakfast during a long layover this morning. The food was good, but not my favorite. The crepes weren't super sweet, but just sweet enough.

Service could use a little work... I had my order taken by the manager, then water brought by one waiter, my drink brought by another waiter, the crepes brought by a third waitress, and then a fourth waitress took care of my check. Wow!
