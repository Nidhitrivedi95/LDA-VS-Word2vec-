grHISDkIGwttYthhW8DxCQ Extremely happy with the is choice for breakfast during my stay in Montreal. So good I came back the rest of my stay. 

As some who allergic to gluten and corn, it is usually difficult for me to find places where I can eat without compromising. No compromise here. Full flavor. Full menu options 
Chick pea crepes for regular food items, rice based crepe for sweets. 

Quaint environment. Staff is super friendly and kind. Food was served fairly quickly. Great if you like mom and pop shops. Not a bad thing to say. Only good.
