HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw Comme Ca has undeniably amazing food. We ordered the Comme Ca burger and it was one of the best we had ever eaten. However the staff and service really put a dampener on our experience. The waitress was far too concerned with twirling her hair, checking her phone and talking to the girls in the front booth to ever notice we were sitting waiting to be served. We weren't offered water and she walked passed our table about 5 or 6 times to talk to the girls without helping us at all. 

We were there for happy hour and received our first cocktails which were lovely.  Then after asking for a second, we noticed the waitress and barman whisper to each other and then received 2 very watered down cocktails.. We don't even know if there was ANY alcohol in them. They were obviously trying to rip us off. Then when it came to paying for our meal there was no one to ask for the bill as the waitress had left for the day (as we saw her walk out) without checking if we needed anything or letting us know. We had to ask a person walking past for the bill. Great food, but terrible service.
