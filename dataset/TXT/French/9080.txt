4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Loved it! Although it was kinda chilly to seat outside we didnt mind and it was worth it- very romantic overlooking the B's fountains. I had the crab cake apptz (yum!) and the Mac & Cheese (double yum), my husband had the salmon and he raved about it as well, no wine and the bill added up to aprox $60
