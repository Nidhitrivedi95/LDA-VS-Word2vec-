gLuaw6h5WgImHpjseAHVrQ I was very impressed last night. I had read solid reviews on this place and was provided strong verbatim from a reputable source. We were received with excellent service and all our questions attended to with careful detail. Now let's discuss the food. The only complaint I may have, if you can call it a complaint, is in regards to the oysters. I pick and choose my oysters with great care and I found the ones I had a little bland. Terrine of duck and foie gras was spot on. Now the mains ! I had the best veal sweetbreads ever !!! My fiancé had the hangar steak and it was equally divine ! Getting back to my Veal sweetbreads - a real orgasm ! I highly recommend this place to all and wish the staff at Wilfred much success.
