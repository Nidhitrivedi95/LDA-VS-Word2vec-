I've eaten here twice, once for lunch which was pretty good and on another occasion for dinner which was somewhat disappointing. 

The atmosphere is lively and modern and the menu is full of creative and beautifully presented dishes. However, they were off the mark on a couple of areas. Together with my friends we had the opportunity to sample a selection of dishes most of which were good. However, there were a couple of major short comings. One was a pasta dish that we shared. The dish was so salty that it would have been impossible for one person to have eaten the entire plate. When we mentioned this to our server I didn't get the impression that it really registered. The other menu item that was questionable was the octopus. The Octopus should have been the highlight of the dish, but it was buried in a highly acidic garnish that completely over powered the flavour of the octopus. 

Of note is that they have a daily rotisserie special which is well worth ordering.
