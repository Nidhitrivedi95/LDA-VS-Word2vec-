OYHpqY6-3C-wXR-uPbHhwA Small bakery/cafe with super friendly service. Great for quick to-go pastries. You order first inside, take a number and take a first come first serve table. 

We sat outside, which is pet friendly :) and ordered a couple breakfast dishes (their breakfast crepe and omelet) and coffee, which never went empty. 

Our food was good but nothing fancy. I think I would have liked a bit more veggies in my build-my-own omelet and ranch potatoes, but can't really complain because it was still good and I didn't come with a huge appetite. I think they are known for their red velvet pancakes though (which I'll have to try next time). 

The servers and other staff are very friendly and attentive. Our drinks and coffee never went empty, and we never had to wait too long for anything.

I got one of their raspberry muffins to-go and sooooo glad I did! It was the best muffin I've ever had! Not too sweet, buttery but not messy, moist, flavorful... I really loved the top of the muffin (which is always the best part, right?). It was a little crispier cookie-like, dusted with powder sugar, and a little sweeter, butterier. Another great thing is that their muffins are HUGE!

I will definitely be back!!!
