3FyoKvUGfKSIun6ZvrEhWQ I have to admit, it makes me a little sad to leave a three star review for this place. I've walked by for years and always meant to give it a try, and tonight was the night. 

To start, service was great - quiet night (Saturday) with only 8 of 28 seats filled at any point during the night, but we weren't rushed or ignored and they took great care of us. 

Atmosphere was nice. Restaurant had something on the board outside talking about 20 years in business, and I can tell you - it felt like the early 90s in there, but in the best possible way. Sade CD playing (joking, but it felt like that), exposed brick walls, French advertising prints on the walls. 

And, the food. The food was a little sad. Started with stale focaccia (olive oil and vinegar on the table - when was the last time you saw that?).  We had sweet potato croquettes to start, which were fine, but indifferent. I had the escargot next, which were dried out, but wife's garlic soup was wonderful. 

Big disappointment was the mains - wife's boeuf bourguignon was dry and flavourless (the latter I thought was impossible with that dish). My lamb shank was under seasoned and dry, though the grains it was served with were great. 

After that, we didn't have the heart to order dessert, sadly. Hoping this restaurant can find it's mojo again for the next 20 years.
