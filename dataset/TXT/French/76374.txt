Yp9w4nhUowBU_IS_StFXbQ Tableau provides a beautiful outdoor dining experience. 

The orange juice is freshly squeezed and extremely fresh and delicious. Unfortunately it's $7 for a small juice glass which is outrageous but you're in Vegas so...

We both got bananas foster French toast. My Mom loved it. I didn't care for it. I didn't like the bread they used. It tasted like banana bread...almost cakey. I prefer just a regular bread if you are going to have such sweet toppings. I wouldn't order it again. In the past I've had the bananas foster French toast from Terrace Point Cafe which was much better than here. I noticed on this visit that Tableau had it and Terrace Point did not. Their version was better! My Mom also got a side of bacon which she requested be crispy. She really enjoyed it. We got a croissant which was amazing! If I could, I would eat one a day for the rest of my life! 

Multiple people waited on us throughout our dining experience. At least 4, maybe 5. It doesn't matter so much as long as you are being well taken care of but it is difficult to build a bond with your person and it's confusing come tip time because to me it seems more like a buffet restaurant tip than normal table service. 

The only thing that takes away from outdoor dining here is the fact that birds will visit the empty tables and poke around. I feel like since the staff know this happens, they should be clearing the tables much quicker than they do. If the tables were cleared quicker, the birds wouldn't have anything to dine on. We saw some birds take a pastry and fly away. It bothered my Mom much more than it bothered me but it definitely isn't something that people want to see happening at a fancy, expensive breakfast.
