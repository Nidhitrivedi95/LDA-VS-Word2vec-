UxWH8zRYIBgs6Q2oykvRdw So. Much. Food. I came here for brunch with girlfriends and this was the only occasion that we didn't opt for the summerlicious menu as there were just too many Amazing baked goods on offer. We opted for the baked good selection AS WELL as each ordering a brunch item. 

I have no photos of the baked goods because they disappeared immediately. They were all amazing but the chocolate-almond croissant, and the lemon-cranberry scone were unbelievable and really left an impression. We all went to purchase these items in the bakery after our meal, even though we were completely stuffed. 

I ordered a version of eggs benedict with prosciutto that was so amazing, but it was also so much food that I could not finish it all. I want to let everyone know: it seems all brunch options are served with fries - really was not expecting that one!

Our waiter was also wonderful - he chose our baked goods and had all sorts of great advice for our meal. The only thing I wished he'd mentioned was just how much food we had ordered - we were all so full!
