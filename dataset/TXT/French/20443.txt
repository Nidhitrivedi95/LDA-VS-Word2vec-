AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw This is definitely one of my newest faves for sweets in Vegas! Lovely selection of cakes, gelatos, sandwiches, pastries, and chocolates! They also have their own candles which all smelled so yummy!! We got an assortment of cakes for my friend's birthday (opera, chocolate decadence, tiramisu, strawberry Napoleon, chocolate caramel) and all were lovely :). The staff also gave me candles for free! Their gelato is great too, and for $7 you get an extremely generous serving on a large waffle cone- I would estimate about 2/3 of a pints worth of ice cream, probably a bit more! Still a bit pricey but totally worth it if you are an ice cream lover like me :). I brought home cloudless chocolate cookies and palmiers for the roommate and my SO, and even though they aren't sweets people, they said it was really good too! Next time, I may indulge and buy one of those heavenly smelling candles!
