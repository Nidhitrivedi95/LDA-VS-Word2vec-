lzwNoKVBC5eJe87151tPSA I must say that I was happily surprised by 98 South.  My husband and I discovered it one night when we were living in Chandler and looking for something to do -- who isn't in Chandler?  They have a pretty decent wine menu and the food isn't bad.  I gave it four stars because I think it's a tad overpriced for what it is and what you get.  It's also very loud -- bad acoustics.
