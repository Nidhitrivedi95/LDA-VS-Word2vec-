oQIm77kYhudya-36pZ-3_w Came here on a hunt for macarons and I was disappointed. They were nowhere in sight so I had to ask for them which made me a bit nervous. I got each of the different flavours available and I found that most of them tasted very similar. Pricing was standard $25 for a dozen but it wasn't worth it at all
