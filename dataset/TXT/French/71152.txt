xcmmTXhuMx2fZF2Bt69F4w Mussels on mussels on mussels. That's all I want now. Their mussels are absolutely fantastic and once you have them, it will become your new obsession. Be sure to order extra bread to dip in the various sauces that the mussels come served in. I would like to try other menu items, however, I can't fathom ordering anything other than mussels because they are so fabulous here. My friend's have ordered other menu items and have all been very pleased.  

Unfortunately, this place is fairly small, so arrive their before the rush!
