or4UVDjXEEjze3wNPjoAZA Gorgeous patio weather! Had a French press coffee which was very good to start lunch with.  Very attentive and on point service especially with the table assistants.  I ordered the Ham and Gruyere omelette with a Radish Frisée and potato strings.  I am insufferably picky about how two things are prepared 1) steaks 2) eggs!  The omelette was absolutely perfect fluffy yet substantial and the ham was perfectly carved and more authentic than the usual deli meat tasting cubes that are usually tossed into omelettes.  The salad was very good my only complaint was the potato strings are more of a garnish as they are tasteless and awkward to eat.  My friend had the Avocado, Marcona almond, shaved red onion, tomato, ricotta salad with cool Dungeness crab, lime pickle and chopped egg....delicious! Very fresh, colorful and crisp.  Next time I have to order like a cliche American tourist and try their Croque Monsieur (France's version of a grown up ham and cheese sandwich) I haven't had one since I was in France.
