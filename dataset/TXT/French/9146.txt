4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I really loved everything about Mon Ami Gabi, but more then anything I LOVED their service. 

I am going to have a hard time going back to restaurants back home because of the impeccable service we received. There wasn't a second my water was less than half full. There wasn't a second that the waitress wasn't socializing and keeping our table entertained. 

When the food came out we were already full from all the appetizers, the bread is so damn good and you know that they make it fresh. 

Things we ordered:
-Baked Goat Cheese w/ Garlic Bread 10/10 (if you don't get anything that I recommended, I highly suggest getting this.)
-Bone In Ribeye 9/10
-Bison Ribeye 8/10
-BLT Ceasars Salad 8.5/10
-French onion soup 8/10

P.S. I enjoyed this place much more than Gordon Ramsey's restaurant, and that says something.

Lastly, you can ask to sit outside and watch the Fountain Show at the Bellagio Hotel, and that's the icing to the cake. 5 STARS... All Day Long.
