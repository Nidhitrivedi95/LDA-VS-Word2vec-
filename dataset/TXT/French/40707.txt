KbBMhk_G57WQ2M_9srNbCQ Came here with my Monday BYOW posse (I love you guys, long time!)

The neighbourhood was dark and bleak that night, so this place definitely stood out as looking like 'one of these things is not like the other'. It is a really chic, minimalist looking place with a lot of variety on the menu so there is definitely something for everyone. Our waiter was very friendly and helpful and given that we were pretty much the only people dining here, the service was extra snappy.

I had the mushroom tart followed up by the tuna tartare. Both were done well, but nothing spectacular about either of them: the tart was buttery and the tartare was nice and not overly seasoned. I agree with Risa D's comment that the  math of the Table D'Hote  didn't quite add up, so definitely go à la carte. I feel like the place was a tad pricey for what it was, but I wouldn't say no to going back again.

Love the vibe, handwritten menu and service, but the food didn't blow my mind.
