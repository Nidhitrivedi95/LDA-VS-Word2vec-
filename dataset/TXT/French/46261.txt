MZ4EEf4VtkeSJURIGgp2AQ ENVIRONMENT: 4/5 - Definitely a hidden gem in Markham. This family-run restaurant is small yet cozy. You could even see the owner in the kitchen cooking your meal. A little tight to accommodate large groups but it's comfortable for groups of 4.

FOOD: 4/5 - Always great. Their menu is different every time and only serves a few selection each day. I've tried their braised beef in pasta, and it was so flavourful and tender. You could expect a classic French cuisine, nothing too fancy pancy, just great food with a lot of care to the dish. I brought my parents here and they loved the food. 

SERVICE: 4/5 - The owner was extremely friendly and we had a great time chatting with him over wine. He also shared a little history with the restaurant and his cooking with us.


OVERALL: 4/5
