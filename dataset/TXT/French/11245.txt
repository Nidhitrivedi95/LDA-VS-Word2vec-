4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Me and my wife went there for brunch after a friend recommended it, but we were disappointed with the food and coffee quality. 
The server was nice, but she tried to up-sale our food choices telling us that the french toast comes plain without anything. In fact, the toast comes with berries and maple syrup. 
In addition, the coffee was horrible - it was a transparent, tasteless liquid that looked like tea! I had to change my order to a latte. Needless to say, the latte had no foam at all and it looked and tasted like regular coffee and cream. 
Obviously this place relies on foot-traffic and not on food quality to stay in business. 
Not recommended!
