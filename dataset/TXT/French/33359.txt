hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA I am so glad I discovered Baguette Cafe. It is a very small cafe in a hard to find area. Unfortunately they are open business hours and M-F only which is a downside if you don't work or live in the area. As far as the food-it is top notch and my absolute favorite place to get a sandwich. I feel the ingredients used are fresh. I love any panini that includes the eggplant. It is well cooked and flavored. 

I also love the soups. Every soup I have tried has been pure deliciousness. I've been told they are all homemade and you can tell. 

I also enjoy their iced tea choices. I appreciate a restaurant that has brewed flavored tea, not just the plain unsweetened black tea. 

One time they messed up my order and gave me the wrong order and I did not notice until I was at home. I called to tell Oliver and he offered a free sandwich the next time I come in. That is good customer service and I liked that a lot.

This place has kept me coming back for more every chance I get when I am not working. If they had longer hours and weekend hours I would probably be here more often. 

I can tell the owners passion every time I have come in here. He is always talking to his customers and is genuine with them.
