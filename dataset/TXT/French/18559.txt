aaWhSHpsE285eaSTzDxAMA This place has a good bartender good server but horrible food. I had the Lake Erie Perch Fry that was tasteless. I reordered my meal and it came back with a pound of salt. The wings were OK but the truffle oil fries were not at all what truffle oil fries taste like. I won't return for dinner
