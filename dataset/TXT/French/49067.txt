OmFXBWLv1DoFelP2-RLqFA An intimate, trendy, below street-level restaurant. Tables closely packed together. Our server deftly went back and forth between English and French without skipping a beat. The swing tables are cool to look at, but nobody sat at them during our visit.  We chose five different tapas from the menu including: crispy duck tortillas w hoisin (yum), salmon tartare (delicious), arugula salad (very good), Carnivores humus w duck confit (not exactly what we were expecting) and the hangar steak w lentils (phenomenal).  The food and the service are truly exceptional.  My complaint is a small one.. the servers run up and down the stairs constantly, stomping the whole time.  This gets a little distracting.  Perhaps there is something that can be done about this? Maybe they need to take a few seconds to "walk softly", but then again who does anything quietly anymore?
