rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw We made dinner reservations for four at Bardot after reading the positive reviews and having preciously visited Stripsteak which is another Michael Mina restaurant. The classy decor, style and overall vibe of the place is definitely one with a throwback feel. Upon entering we were immediately greeted and seated right away.

The waiter quickly took and brought our drinks and informed us of the night's specials. I tried to convince the table to order the Duck wings a L'Oreal but we ended up ordering the bone marrow and charcuterie board. The board was good but nothing too exciting but the bone marrow was simply devine and easily the best I've ever ordered at any steak house.

We ended up ordering the code which was on special and the double pork chop. Our friends both got steaks. They have a good selection of beers on tap and the service and ambience is second to none. We hope to be back soon. This is a great place to treat yourself when in Las Vegas
