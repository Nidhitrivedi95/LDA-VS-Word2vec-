mr4FiPaXTWlJ3qGzp4-7Yg We were here for brunch a few weeks back - delish !  Service was great, food was fantastic, and as a nice surprise we didn't have to wait all that long for a table.  And a good brunch can't just rely on its food for good reviews, so the answer is yes, the Ceasars were awesome.  We don't really live in the area but our visit here was really good so we'll be back.
