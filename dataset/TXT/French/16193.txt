7h4nuLjd18da9kg1Qc2rnw Just ate here last night with the in laws and my man for his birthday. Understandably, the the dead of summer in Scottsdale, at 8 pm, the restaurant was dead. Yet, the maitre d and the waitress were MORE than hospitable and treated us like real guests. The restaurant is BEAUTIFUL! A perfect place for a romantic dinner or even an intimate party. It was late, so we skipped the appetizers. I ordered the vealm oscar, my mom in law the house special, rack of lamb, my pa in law, the duck l'orange, and my man, the fuits de mer. All of if was sensational. yet, to me, the serivce trumped it all. They even gave us some amazing creme brulee to sing happy birthday with! Definetly going to be frequenting here again!
