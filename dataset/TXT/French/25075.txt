Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA went there a couple of weeks ago. Party of five. Everyone enjoyed their meal. We had multiple appetizers and each had a different main course. Everyone was happy with all the food. I had the braised Wagu, very good was surprised as it was one of the least expensive entrées. Never had it before so wanted to try something new. Service was great. All in all, very good restaurant, not great but very very good.
