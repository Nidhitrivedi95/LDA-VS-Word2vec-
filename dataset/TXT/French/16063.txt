78TC3sZSYBzBsSJ0z5pyhw We arrived in Vegas somewhat late and found that most of the restaurants close early (before 10pm)-for a city that's up all night that doesn't make any sense to me. We stayed in Paris, so we wandered around looking for a nearby restaurant. It was 10pm and Le Provencal was still open (until 10:30). The only good thing I can say about the place is that it was open when we walked in. The food quality was less than a Denny's and the price outrageous. For 2 entrees 2 salads and 2 ice teas our bill was about $60. If the food had been decent quality I could have said, well that's just Vegas, but $60 for undercooked, no flavor food is bad. The service was mediocre. The guy came by put oil and vinegar out for bread dipping then came by with a large basket of bread and placed one small cold piece of bread in front of each of us and that was it. Forget eating at Paris late at night, go down to the Venetian and eat at the Grand Lux, much better food, service and price.
