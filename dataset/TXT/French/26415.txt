They have adventurous choices on the menu, like venison, quail, and other game. I stuck with the vongole entree. Clams were fresh. Pasta was done perfectly and tasted homemade. I also ordered a side of brussels sprouts - these were too salty and seasoned with too much cheese. The dishes my friends got also looked pretty.

I would come here again, if only for the relaxing atmosphere.
