hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA If I can give this place more than 5 stars I would. Service was fantastic. The owner was extremely nice and although there was a long line, he didn't make me feel like he was rushing for me to order at all. And to go above and beyond he even came OUTSIDE to where we were sitting to talk to us. 

Next is the food. I tried the chicken curry sandwich and chicken pesto sandwich. Both of which were the best sandwiches I've ever had. I've never had chicken as soft as the ones in these sandwiches. Everything was great. My boyfriend also got their latte which was sitting in an open cup outside through our whole meal and was surprisingly still hot at the end when we poured it into a to go cup. Overall, I will be coming back!
