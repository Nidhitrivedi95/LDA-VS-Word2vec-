kcF-en40P3J9L8nLy5lKqQ 3 stars is pushing it. The new menu is underwhelming and their "new" social hour is disappointing at best. They have managed to successfully ruin everything I loved about this place. Service. Menu. Oysters. Also, it's weird they don't serve lunch and exclusively serve their new (more expensive yet subpar) social hour menu until dinner service starts. One word: Avoid. You can have a much better experience and get more bang for your buck somewhere else in the area. Especially with so many options in the neighborhood. It's sad really, I used to love this place.
