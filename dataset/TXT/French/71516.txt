XcWlBj5oQgzKhR7Cxovj3w Who the f*ck reviews a restaurant in the Phoenix airport? Food/booze while traveling is meant to be purely utilitarian - you consume some unhealthy item, quickly, which enables you to drink more. Yeah, that's what I thought too, but then I tried this joint and liked it so much I actually sought it out from the D gates, months later, when on a similar layover.

Being on the west coast and a frequent Southwest customer (and one of those people who loves to be on the first flight of the day), I'm generally skirting through PHX before 10am, which enables me to have the breakfast sandwich. A buttery croissant with a fried egg and gruyere. So damn good - enough to make you temporarily forget about the inconvenience of flying through Phoenix. The Bloodies don't hurt either.

The bartenders and servers are also super nice. To be fair, this is early in the morning when things are relatively uncrowded.

In short, I am this person: http://www.theonion.com/article/frequent-flyer-knows-out-of-the-way-airport-bar-th-1378 and you should trust my airport recommendations.
