The navy beans were undercooked and almost crunchy. The raw oysters were overly fishy and tiny. The French onion soup was nothing special. The bread in it looked and tasted like wheat loaf bread. The House Vouvray was corked. The service was abrupt and uninformed. Her lack of knowledge of the menu - and French cuisine - was inexcusable. And if you are charging $25-$30 a plate, the servers should know how to pronounce what they are serving. Cocktails and desserts were good. Atmosphere is nice.
