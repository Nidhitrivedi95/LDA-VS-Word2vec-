t1mR_Zff6Dqv1TueE2JLEA We were there for summerlicious on a Thursday night. The place was a little busy . The food was about 7 out of 10. The ambiance was great and comfortable. There was a belly dancer for entertainment and it was quite nice to watch. Now the service, was a bit slow. The starter came almost the minute we sat down. Everything else was very slow after that. Waiter's attention was so hard to get but even after we asked how much longer our fools will take, it still took another 20 min. Also staff had no personality. One of the football player looking server was just rude who looked like he didn't want to be there. He was tossing the plates on to our table with out saying anything . Service could improve a lot. Over all the place is not bad and could be better if the servers were happier.
