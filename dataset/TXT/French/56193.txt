rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Amazing restaurant! We ate here twice in one weekend! Located in the Venetian with its own elevator from the casino level, Bouchon leaves little to be desired. Plates are large and reasonably priced for such decadence and service. The Steak frites was very tender, grilled to perfection, the mussel plate come with a million mussels! Wine-sauce was perfect for the meal. Each plate came with French fries---and a ton at that, the server mentioned that each plate comes with 17 potatoes.

Brunch was delicious. The coffee is the best I've had in a long time. We ordered te cheese tasting (honey and cheese and apples)---great! Madame Croque is fun. It's a sandwich with ham, cheese, eggs, wow. We also ordered their famous chicken and waffles. The chicken isn't fried, it's baked. Waffles are cut into quarters and are full of herbs/tasty spices. We loved the syrup and the savory sauce that came with it. Both dishes came with fries!

5 stars for an amazing dining experience. I wish I could eat here all the time!
