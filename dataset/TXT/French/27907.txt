2021 W Sunset Rd
Henderson, NV  89014
United States

The food is always delicious. I judge a brunch by how good the Eggs Benedict is. Bernard's Bistro makes a MEAN smoked salmon version. That's why I gave the restaurant five stars( or maybe the two glasses of Prosecco I consumed is talking here?!) joking aside, the food, the service and the LIVE Jazz music makes this place a winner!
