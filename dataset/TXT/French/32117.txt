gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA Top notch service. The view is unmatched. The room is very nice. The food is very good, however my ribeye was overcooked which is why I can't give 5 stars (no, I didn't complain about it). I had lobster bisque with a ribeye and finished with a wonderful chocolate dessert. My partner had onion soup and a filet followed by a pistachio souffle. Between courses we were given a tuna, salmon and halibut ceviche which was excellent as well as a very flavorful sorbet. The bread that preceded the meal was excellent too. Prior to the meal, I ordered a Glenlivet on the rocks. it was just one shot...no more no less. I was curious to see the price of this lousy pour (I later ordered a second) and was happy to see that the price of each drink was $14. I thought that was reasonable for that type of pour and that type of restaurant. The bill for two with tax and tip was $263, which I think is reasonable in light of the flawless service, the spectacular view, and the food quality. I will return to this restaurant in July when I revisit Las Vegas.
