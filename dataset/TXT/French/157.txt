The staff recommended the lamb bolognese but I didn't think it was all that special. What I truly enjoyed was the kale salad!   Next time I'll try the Mission, but will only return to House for patio seating and drinks. Thank you to our server who wrote down a couple of lounges for us to visit post dinner.
