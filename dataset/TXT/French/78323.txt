yVNaMEBUslR_7GbFhurJEg I came here for brunch since its right by my house. 

I came by myself, sat at the bar, and had an americano and steak tartare. Prices are pretty up there for this neighborhood and the portions aren't enormous, but I did not leave feeling hungry. The food was very good and the people were friendly and courteous. 

As for the quality of everything, it is great. Space is also very nice. This is the second week they are open and you can tell people are already talking about it, since it was half full with well dressed people and their charming, well behaved children. :) In the coming weeks I'm sure it'll totally pack up with lines out the door.

Also, I have to say that, food aside, this place is going to totally revitalize a public square with enormous potential. In the summer there will be seats outside, etc etc, and it will be amazing. Prior to this was pretty much an abandoned looking subway station. 

Conclusion: I am very happy that H4C is open and, while it is not an everyday or perhaps even every week kind of place, it will be a wonderful addition to the neighborhood. Good food and will return.
