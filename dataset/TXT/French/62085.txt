SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ This is certainly one of the better places in Tempe and the courtyard area is quite a nice place if the weather isn't crazy hot. I ate lunch here and I was impressed with how one of the managers was educating the staff about the wine specials for the day and he had an impressive knowledge of many things that just aren't generally imparted to wait staff at most places (he went off into detail about microbes in the soil of South Africa giving wine certain flavors etc).   I enjoyed the flank steak I got for lunch except it was a very small portion and flank steak just isn't the best cut of meat to do very much with.  I inspected the dinner menu and it looked to have some very promising items on it that would certainly be worth checking out but the prices increased substantially for the dinner entrees.  I certainly think this would be a great place just to enjoy some great wine with friends.
