rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A We loved Bouchon! 
The hostess kindly sat us early since we arrived a bit early. Our waiter was helpful and friendly, the food was tremendous.  We started with a sazerac...very delicious. Then, on to a cheese plate (the blue roll) that was incredibly mild and smooth, served with sliced apple. It satisfied me, a blue cheese lover, and my husband, someone who is not fond of blue. Worked for both of us! There was also some delicious bread as an intro plate, and pistachios, very fresh. I then had the scallops as a main (gigantic and wonderful), and my husband had the lamb shank (a meat lover's dream) along with a side of cabbage fondue and bone marrow. Thank goodness we had meds for cholesterol with us, I am sure we used our year's allotment for fatty foods all in one meal. Wonderful and a very enjoyable evening.
