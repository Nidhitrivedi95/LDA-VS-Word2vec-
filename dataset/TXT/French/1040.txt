_cVCzKQGt23KKW1M07Yvkw I was so looking forward to a wonderful French bistro in the hood and sadly we were incredibly underwhelmed. When we arrived the server was very pleasant, chatty, perhaps overly so and then, gone once the food arrived, never cam by to ask how the food was. Had she we would have said that the salmon tartare was tasteless and the fries were like frozen fries not frites that one would expect in a French bistro. The tuna had bones in it and was also tasteless. The ratatouille that came with the tuna helped although
The two didn't seem to pair.
Worst of all was the '80's music- terrible and very loud- not at all fitting with the vibe or what one would expect. It was hard to enjoy. Again, had anyone attended to us other than changing plates and cutlery, I would have expressed this. Even when we got the bill, no inquiry as to how was your meal, did you enjoy - nothing.  I can as easily go to La Palette, just down the road where the service is spectacular, the food consistently delicious and the vibe relaxed, no crappy music, (and excellent fries, as with oyster boy a few doors away), I will choose to go there over Jules any day.
