O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q Service was great and both the ribeye and filet were wonderful.  Went to celebrate the big 40th birthday with some girlfriends and loved the experience.  One of our friends is a vegetarian and she loved her meal as well.  I didn't care for the fish but with all the other food provided it was soon overlooked. Our server was well versed in wine and was able to entertain a couple of us with his suggestions and stories (it was all foreign to me but my friends were having a ball).  Overall a delightful evening.
