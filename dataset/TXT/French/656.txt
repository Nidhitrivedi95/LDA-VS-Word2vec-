_63Gyd8nN_tIUrr6bG0zWA We've come to Cafe Republique a couple of times in the last couple of months as we are planning our wedding at the Windsor Ballroom next door. It is the perfect place to meet with potential vendors, discuss plans and have a nice espresso. The ambiance is always nice and service is efficient. I like that they have Leffe Blonde on tap too!
