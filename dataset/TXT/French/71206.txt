xcmmTXhuMx2fZF2Bt69F4w Apparently this place is one of the more popular places in Pittsburgh. Went here for a late lunch on a Sunday afternoon. I didn't expect anybody to be in the restaurant, but actually half of the tables were occupied. Here is the reason: Point Brugge Café is a great spot to relax and have a beer with some great tasting foods.

There are 3-4 tables outside and about 10 tables inside. You also have the option to sit at the bar. We decided to sit inside, next to the window, and enjoy the view of the outside as sun was lightning up the whole place. It was so bright inside, perfect for a Sunday afternoon. They have a few beers on tap, but had never heard of any of those beers. Their selection is so unique. I tried two of their draft beers, and they were both delightful (I hear they rotate their beers quite often, but if your going there anytime soon get the beer that has the word shoes in it).

For food I ordered a pound and a half of mussels with red curry sauce which was priced at $19. It came with bread, and freshly made fries. The sauce was amazing, so were the fries and so were the mussels. Definitely one of the best mussels I've ever had. Unbelievable, and only for $19? You gotta be kidding me. The service was super fast, and the staff were friendly and attentive. The only thing that bummed me a little was their limited beer selection (you expect a lot of good draft beers from a Belgian restaurant.) Anyway, I definitely recommend Point Brugge!
