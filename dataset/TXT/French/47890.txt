O3OH5IEFMPtz7mPKakPZ3Q Based on the reviews, I was really excited to try this place. During lunch, it's quiet and slow. The waitress was very attentive and suggested some great items to try. As she brought out each dish, she described the plate. 

Tapas style foods, great for sharing. If you are looking for a heavy huge meal, this is not the place. We tried the scallop with uni off the specials menu. It was perfectly paired and perfectly cooked. The tuna tacos were small but packed great flavor. Chilean bass butter lettuce wraps were good but not overly impressive. 

Over all the restaurant is worth a try and has great food. I will be back to try more dishes!
