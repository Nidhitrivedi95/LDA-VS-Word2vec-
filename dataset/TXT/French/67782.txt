UxWH8zRYIBgs6Q2oykvRdw I went here with some friends for a birthday and expected a lot since this is considered Toronto's #1 French restaurant according to blog.to.  Wow were we in for a disappointment. 

Ill make this review short and simple.  This is more like the "Dennys" of french cuisine if you know what I mean.  Some prime examples were the frogs legs I ordered came battered, fried and served with what seemed to be Frank's Red Hot sauce...if that doesn't blow your mind the sea food platter I had as my main came out deep fried and greasy like I was at the CNE food building getting my carnival fix.

Needless to say this is far from french cusine, but more like what Mr. Greek would be to greek food.  Would I come back here again,  simply put no.
