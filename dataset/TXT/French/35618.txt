htQgj-ANQpZGpIpkkrEmyQ I came here on a Thursday night with reservations as I was advised by friends. The place was packed and the service was amazing. I got the Udon carbonaro and my sister got the IST chicken burger. Every bite I had of the Udon was sooo flavourful and I usually avoid red meats. My sister said the IST burger was the best burger she had. I liked the portion size because it wasn't too overwhelming and we were able to finish our dishes. Def coming back to try their breakfast! highly recommended joint !
