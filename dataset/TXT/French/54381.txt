rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw After some very disappointing meals and terrible service, Bardot redeemed my Las Vegas culinary experience. 

Service was extraordinary. Ambiance and decor was like sitting on the champs élysées in Paris. The wine list was extensive and the wine we ordered was available (a first in Vegas). The food was great. Fabulous flavours. The macaroni cheese side is oh my goodness - wow! The tartes light and flavoursome - the goat cheese Apple combo was scrummy as was my sautéed skate wing. We just wish that we had time for dessert but we had a show to dash to. All round - a great culinary scrummy experience. Very much recommended!
