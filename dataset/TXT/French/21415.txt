B56AYe5GNuavMDtwFsXqzA I've been dining at Petite Maison since it opened and have never had a disappointing experience. I prefer dining on the patio by the fireplace instead of inside. 

Last Friday evening, my girlfriend and I enjoyed another great meal. 

The salad was made with organic, locally grown micro greens in a delicious sherry vinaigrette. The salad was complimented by a crispy-fried round of goat cheese. 

The French onion soup was prepared in the classic manner. The beef broth was rich and hearty and the onions were sweet and melted in your mouth. Who doesn't love the melting cheese that was bubbling when brought to the table? 

The trout almondine was perfectly boned, butter and smooth. It was served with a green bean salad. 

One of the biggest surprises was the French sodas. Okay seltzer and sugary flavorings are available most places, but here that have the combination down. Its a great nonalcoholic beverage alternative.
