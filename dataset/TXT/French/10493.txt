4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Mon ami is really the only decent restaurant to dine in Vegas.  The irony is that it is in the Paris hotel across from the Bellagio fountains.  Every time I am in Vegas, I make sure to have lunch and/or dinner here because the food is very well prepared at reasonable rates.   

I really enjoy the seafood crepes.  It filled with scallops, shrimp, veggies, and a cream sauce.  It is very tasty and only $14.  You cannot do wrong with their steak frites.  A 14 ouce steak that would out-compete most steak-houses I know.  For $25 bucks, can't beat the price for a quality meal.  

I highly recommend grabbing a table in the patio and enjoy the people watching.  On a sunny day, the setting reminds me of sitting in a cafe on Saint Michel in actual Paris....
