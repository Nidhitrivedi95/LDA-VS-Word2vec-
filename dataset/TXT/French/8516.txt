4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Bad food at a beautiful location. Lesson learned, sit on the patio or go elsewhere. We made the mistake of coming here for the brunch food, which was on par with Denny's.

It was a 45 minute wait for a table outside on a Saturday at 11am so we sat inside instead. We were seated near the entrance. The dining room was too dark. The tables were way too close together, other diners stepped all over us trying to sit down, and we didn't want to hear their NASCAR and Budweiser conversation.

Our waiter took our orders, served our food, and checked once to make sure everything was okay. Other than that, he was completely forgettable. Oh, except that he corrected wifey's pronunciation of crêpe as "crape". *POP* goes the sound of the pretend-we're-in-Paris bubble.

Our main complaint was the food, it was uniformly bad.

The crêpe was served floating in a grainy béchamel sauce that tasted like raw flour and pretty much ruined it.

The Croque Madame egg was overcooked (no runny yolk), cheese was congealed, and toast was dry.

Our brunch came with a generous serving of french fries so thin they were nearly potato chips, and they were pretty tasty.

The make-your-own Bloody Mary bar is genius and delicious, there's tons of fresh and pickled veggies, different stuffed olives, and different hot sauces to choose from. I would have liked a larger glass to get more good stuff in there, 1 shot of vodka and some ice filled half the glass. There was hardly any room to put all the goodies in. I did love that you can choose any vodka (goose please!).
