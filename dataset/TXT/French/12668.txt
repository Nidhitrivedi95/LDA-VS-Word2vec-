4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I've been here twice, and both times blew my mind.  Ok...the first time was for my brother's bachelor party.  We can't talk about what went down...I might get some people in trouble...but the steak I had was amazing.  It had some kind of dijon sauce...sooooo good.!!!!  Anyways...they treated our party of 15 like royalty and I was very pleased that I chose them as the place to take my bro for that special night.  
I also went there for lunch about a week ago, and had the ahi tuna burger...it was ridiculously good...everything about it...oh yeah...and Holly Madison was sitting right next to us the whole time...kinda cool...but whatever...the service has been very good every time...if you're in Vegas...go here...Oh yeah...and the view of the Bellagio fountains is pretty awesome too...
