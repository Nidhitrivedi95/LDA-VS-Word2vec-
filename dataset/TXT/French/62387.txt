SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ This is one of my all time favorite restaurants in the area. I love sitting at the outdoor bar and enjoying the view from what feels like a secret garden. I have so many favorites here, I don't know where to start. First of all, sit at the bar and get amazing service and the best mojitos that I've ever had from Renee. Try the kale Caesar, mussels with chorizo, Asian pork sandwich, any of the soups or the most decent pb&j of your life! This is a one of a kind place for food and ambiance.
