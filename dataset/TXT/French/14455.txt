5Bp8rQlvD44_W2lkcCc2vw I loved this restaurant! The service was excellent and fast, the waiter was very patient in explaining to us the menu and helping us choose a bottle of wine for our meal, he even helped me make some changes to the prix fixe to better suit my taste! 

The food was excellent, delicious, and just omg tasty! the rabbit puff pastry was delectable! I'm still reminiscing it as I'm typing. I also had the lamb which was perfectly done! Tender, fresh, and the fat was crispy and just perfect! The desserts were varied and also amazing, too bad we were to full to try more of them, we only ended up sharing one but they were beautifully presented. 

It makes for a good "let's get dressed up and go out" night!
