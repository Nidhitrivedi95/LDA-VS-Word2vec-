ZdaZwXC0FByDY3EwNELphw Probably one of my favourite places to eat brunch and dinner.

Food is as fresh as it can get.  And you can taste it!
Combinations are great.
Had Steak Hash, Maple Bread pudding
Wife had Swiss train ride (Croque Madame)

Unbelievably tasty , good prices,  service was good. atmosphere also was one of the better ones in the Ossington strip.  Smaller restaurant as you will be rubbing elbows with your neighbours, but it just allows you to look at their food too, if you ordered something different!  Make friends and share I say!

It's my go to place on Ossington even with the many up and coming restaurants flocking to that strip!
