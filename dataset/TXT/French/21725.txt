Bf-yMQiSmDZyqfGyFKQ0bA Nice selection at beers at prices that don't empty your wallet. It seems like the staff really thinks about their beer list because there is a choice to fit every taste. 

Speaking of the staff, they are really friendly and a group of us chatted with the bartenders the entire evening as the Homestead trains chugged by right outside the window.

Didn't try any food, except for some of the snacks they have pickling behind the bar. Try the pickled radishes. (I know it sounds weird, but they are awesome)
