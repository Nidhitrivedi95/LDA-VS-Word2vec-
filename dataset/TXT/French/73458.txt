xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g I had been looking forward to dining here for quite some time; however, I am pretty disappointed in our overall experience. Even after making reservations ahead of time, we still had to wait a while for our table. Considering that we came on a busy Saturday night, the initial wait was not the issue. I was initially disappointed in the fact that we were given a table that was somewhat tucked away without a direct view of the fountains. Our waitress was not very friendly and took quite a long time to bring our drinks. In fact, our drinks didn't come until our appetizers had arrived. We ordered the non-traditional Caesar salad and the asparagus soup. Although we were more than happy with the amazing flavor of the salad, the soup was lukewarm. I had been looking forward to ordering the Wellington but was underwhelmed with the dish. The sauce that accompanied the entree seemed to lack flavor. The creamed spinach and mushroom side dish was absolutely delicious! Another plus side was how much we enjoyed the cocktails once they arrived. I am giving 3 stars instead of 2 due to the salad, side dish, and tasty cocktails. We've dined with many many restaurants on the strip but I am sad to say that this restaurant did not live up to my expectations.
