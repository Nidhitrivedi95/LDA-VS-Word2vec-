rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I was very excited that our last meal in vegas would be a French breakfast. I had really hoped for a delicious send off. But alas I was disappointed. I ordered spicy sausage, eggs and toast breakfast and the sausage was ok. The eggs eggs and the bread extremely buttery. It was really just average. Better than Denny's, not as good as that local breakfast joint we all know. The boyfriend had ham and cheese eggs with sauce on a piece of toast which I see a picture of here. We both agreed the sauce was a bit too much. Also fries. As if the butter cream sauce on eggs and buttered toast didn't make you feel like a large marge they give you fries. Which were good. Salty and thinly sliced and reminded me very much of McDonalds. Which you may not want when you're looking for a fine French meal. The tab was pretty high for this not so special meal.
