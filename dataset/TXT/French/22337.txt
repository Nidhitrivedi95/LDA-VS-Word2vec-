We both had eggs benedict (fiorentina and california, $12), which was perfect - the sauce has a peppery bite and it comes with fresh fruit and herbed potatoes.  My husband tried the house-made sausage and loved it.  We didn't take advantage of the bottomless mimosas and bloody mary's ($12), but next time we will for sure!

The owner personally came to our table to say thank you for dining with them and have us free panna cotta (the best I've had in the states, normally $7).  

We will definitely try it again.
