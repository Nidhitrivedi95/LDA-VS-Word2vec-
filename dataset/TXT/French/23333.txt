C6hljmEZYZw4pA0OJaFOjQ I've driven past this so many times and felt intrigued to try but never actually did it until the OH decided to book it for lunch!

I'm glad he did.  To start, we both had crab fritters which were very similar to arancini and so creamy.  The saffron cream that came with the fritters really brought out the flavours.  It was quite a delight.

To follow I tried something different and something I wouldn't do myself at home - Guinea foul.  It was beautifully cooked and came with a lovely sauce.  
The OH enjoyed his duck - nothing left on his plate equals a good thing!

The flat whites were equally as nice.

Service was quick, friendly and efficient.  Although it was quick difficult to catch the servers eyes to pay our bill. My one pick would be of that the sound bounces about the place and it can be quite loud.

Would I reccommened? Yes! Will I go back? Of course!
