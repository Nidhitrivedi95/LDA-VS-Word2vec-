9ot8oInkYZTt6wkkGe__vQ I had been wanting to visit this restaurant for a while and found just the right occasion to have dinner with some friends before heading to Paris to help prepare my pallet lol. I am always a bit hesitant with modern fine dining as the dishes are usually smaller and if the intricate tastes are off it's almost a shame. However, I was not disappointed at all. The meal was delicious. The flavours wee finely tuned and a delight for the pallet. Service was excellent. My wife and i started by sharing a lovely mushroom bruschetta, scallops and an apple Camembert. The scallops melted in your mouth with a very rich and buttery flavour. The bruschetta was also very good with multiple types of sautéed mushrooms on goat cheese with arugula. The Camembert was not as good as the other starters but there was nothing bad about it either. Very nice salad and flavours going on. For dinner I ordered the duck breast served medium with a nice Pinot noir. This was without a doubt the highlight of the night, rich and flavourful it made me think about converting and never having steak again. It was excellent. For dessert I had chocolate and marshmallow cake, my wife the apple sorbet. Both excellent as well but a bit small for the price. Service and food were excellent however the dinner was marred by one thing the entire evening. There were tons of fruit flies all around annoying us and disrupting our meal constantly. The dinner service on the patio had the door left open and many bugs were flying around including some mosquitoes, really an unfortunate annoyance to a great meal. I shall return but in the winter I think. Price is high but worth it for special occasions, go and enjoy.
