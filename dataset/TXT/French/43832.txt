Frédéric and Sophie (the owners and hosts) welcomed us with warm "Happy New Year" greetings and cheerfully provided us with a high chair for the little one in our party.  We'd dined here numerous times before and had never seen children, so we were relieved they could accommodate us.  Some of the best coffee around was our first treat.  We started our meal with a cheese board to share - something for everyone.  Mimosas came next to add to our enjoyment. Between the four of us, we savoured  three different savory crepes (Atlantic, American, and Southwest) and one dessert crepe (Emily's Favorite). All were outstanding. We've still not tried every item on the crepe menu, so future visits are certain. Bonne annee, Frédéric and Sophie. You certainly got our New Year off to a great start!
