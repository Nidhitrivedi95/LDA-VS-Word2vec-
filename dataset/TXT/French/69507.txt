WOd8tWsh2Yt_osHv-ngx_w Brilliant brunch place, conveniently located and worth every bit of it. 

We have been going to this place ever so often and it is one of the best brunches I have had in town. You would get spoilt by choice here, though I suggest the eggs benedict (personally think its the best on their menu). 
The service is great, and the waiters are extremely friendly. If you happen to go there during happy hours and want to order some appetizers, just go with the nachos (big portions and oh oh so yummy). 

Definitely recommend this place to everyone, and if you are getting the French toast- get the chocolate strawberry one- it has powers that can make turn any bad day into a good day.
