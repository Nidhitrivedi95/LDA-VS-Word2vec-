O3OH5IEFMPtz7mPKakPZ3Q I was looking forward to trying this restaurant unfortunately I guess my expectations were set too high because of all the great reviews for this place.. The service was great the waiters and waitress's who work there were very nice and they knew the menu very well.. My husband and I tried a lot of things on the menu and the specials too.. It seemed like this restaurant tried to do a cheaper version of nobu but it was still too expensive for the quality of the food. The worst thing We tried was the soft shell crab which had a weird odor and smelt like it was old. Overall the dishes were bland and no dish was really good but also no dish was really bad with the exception of the soft shell crab. For the amount we paid and the food we got it wasn't worth it..

And one of the waiters told us that the chef was once the executive chef at nobu at the Caesars palace we know people who work there and he was only a cook. Kind of silly to lie to your customers..
