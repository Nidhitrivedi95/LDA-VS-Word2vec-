8ciT6qjI18x9EPtOb-gqYQ There's just something missing at Coup Des Tartes. How do they say? "je ne sais quoi..."?

The interior ambiance is perfect. Probably the highlight.

On my most recent visit, I had the three onion tarte, which has a lovely sweet flavor and the salmon. The salmon was so ordinary. It was cooked well but something was missing from the preparation for me. However, I loved, loved, loved the savory butternut squash risotto. If only the salmon had been as "ah mah zing" (citing the menu) as the risotto was!

I've had the chicken option before, too. It was just fine. 

But, nothing has blown me away. 

And, bringing your own wine to enjoy has the potential to really compliment the whole experience. Make it richer.  The fact that it'll cost you $9 minimum just to open it (a task you literally do yourself) is a sore spot for me. I think that corking fee is waaay too high! 

It's fun to go to coup Des Tartes because the ambiance and you know you'll order a tarte for dessert. It's like, that you'll enjoy dessert is guaranteed -- but, there's something -- that "je ne sais quoi..." that's still lacking...
