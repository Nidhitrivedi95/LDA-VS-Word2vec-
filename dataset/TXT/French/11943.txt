4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw So nice to eat here during the summer to have a nice dinner sitting outside in the warm weather.  Although make sure to eat dinner on the later side so you don't burn up in the sun!  Be prepared to wait a while for an outside table so just because you make a reservation does not mean they will give you an outside table.  You will still have to wait for that.  The food is pretty good but I think the ambiance is what makes this a nice spot for an outdoor dinner.
