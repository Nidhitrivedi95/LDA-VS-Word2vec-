EukD4hlPZXgSMpeya5iX2g Although welcoming, there's a certain oddness to Chez Laurent. Still, it is a place you can take both a 4-year-old and a 90-year-old at the same time (which we did). 

3 adults ordered French Onion Soup. I like it salty, which meant my wife loved this seemingly low-sodium soup. It was served in a regular soup bowl with grated mozzarella and some chunks of bread. It was alright. I then had the Carbonara ($12.99), which was delicious. Wife had Canelloni ($13.99) and daughter had Lasagna ($13.99). Also really good. Grandma had Salmon ($17.99) and was in love with it. Boy, did she clean her plate! The servers were nice. For dessert, Creme Brûlée, Raspberry Tartuffo and Raspberry Pie (or something like that) were also very good. Not great, but good. 

I think the price/value give this a solid 3.5 but it isn't sure whether to be French or Italian so marks are deducted for style. But I'd still return.
