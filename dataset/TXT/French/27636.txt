DlnMwCDIxQ-o5kNMAfOs1g Hidden wine bar just off Charlotte square with a lovely selection of wine

I really like this place, it is hidden behind Le Petite Folie in a beautiful building with a glass roof . The selection of wine is great and the staff are very friendly. The wines are in a huge display over the bar and there is also a little balcony area that you can reserve.

It seems very popular as an after work drinking place as it is full of businessy types from about 4pm. The food is distinctly average but not bad for the price.  Some reviews say its overpriced but I can't agree - the shared platters of charcuterie and cheese are pretty good, very filling and only marginally dearer that a chain pizza from round the corner. The homemade soup delicious too. I say give it a try!
