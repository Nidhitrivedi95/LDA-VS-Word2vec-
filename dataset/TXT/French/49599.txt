or4UVDjXEEjze3wNPjoAZA OK, This is my wife and I's absolute favorite date night destination, when we can afford it.  Even then we usually just sit on the patio and order a glass of wine, the amazing cheese platter app and then share a french press pot of coffee while we wait for the bake-to-order chocolate sufle' with choice of toppings.  I would add that the back patio is probably the most romantic dining space in North Scottsdale. We usually prefer to sit out on the front patio and people watch. I have eaten diner here twice and both times where very good. A bit noisy on this inside and your going to feel real unconfortable if you bring the kiddos.
