OkC86YtZ0Nm19my5F4GGrQ While the food is always great, I unfortunately can't say the same about the service. I had hoped that I came on an off night, but the past 3 times in the last month or so has always been the same. Very very slow. Just too many good restaurants around town to afford to have such slow service. I'd love to keep going but don't want to sit around for almost 2 hours for a simple dinner.
