SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA This restaurant makes you feel like you are in LA or NYC or Chicago. The atmosphere is very chic. And the food is AMAZING!! Some would say it is overpriced, but I disagree. This quality of food in any big city would cost close to twice as much as it does in Cleveland.

Recently went to dinner with friends. We had a seafood fest. My friends and I split the oysters. 1 friend had mussels, another had scallops, a 3rd had the Friday special (Walleye) and I had the salmon. The oysters and salmon were great and everyone enjoyed their respective dinners.

For anyone looking for a good seafood place in Cleveland, this place is definitely worth a trip!
