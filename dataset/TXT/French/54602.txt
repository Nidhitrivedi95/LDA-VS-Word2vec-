rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw Came here for brunch with a few friends and we all enjoyed most of our time here. The king crab crepe with trumpet mushrooms and egg was very rich and flavorful, a can't miss. The Nutella sticky bun was a big portion and delicious as well. We all thought the smoked salmon with brioche was just okay, although the chive mascarpone that came with it was great. We all enjoyed our main courses except one, who ordered her steak medium rare but received it pretty well done (pictured). Service was a tad bit slow as we waited at least ten minutes to put a drink order in. But that didn't deter us from having a good time. Overall, we enjoyed everything, but if I came back, I would want to try their dinner menu.
