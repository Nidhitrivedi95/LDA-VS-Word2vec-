ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug Checked out Le Cafe for breakfast one morning in Vegas. My brother tells me he can't go to Vegas without going to Le Cafe and having corned beef. Apparently a lot of people feel this way because there was actually a line to get in. I wonder if these people thought they were in line for the buffet? No buffet for me in the morning; my hungover ass wants my food brought TO me.

The menu was pretty standard breakfast fare for a diner. I have the eggs Benedict and they were pretty tasty. My plate was garnished with a pretty purple orchid, which was a cute touch. When you order coffee, they give you the entire carafe, which I think is great! Then they don't do that half-cup refill that you get at other places with totally throws off your ratio of coffee-to-milk-to-sugar and messes you up all day. The hash browns were the best part of my meal. But please, oh, please tell me why my breakfast cost $26 for two eggs, two muffins, two slices of ham, some sauce, hash browns, and coffee? Diner food for $26? Only in Vegas.
