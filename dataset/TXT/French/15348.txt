Atmosphere is just ok; since its sitting area is open to the hotel's common street and it is self-service. 

It is very easy to find better places to eat crepes among many other options. I prefer the restaurants on the strip side of the very Paris hotel this place is located in; much better crepes there with perfect service and upscale atmosphere.
