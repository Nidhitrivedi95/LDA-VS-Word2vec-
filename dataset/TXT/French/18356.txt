A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g We have been customers for the past 5 years and while there is constant turnover of employees the service and pastries/bread has always been very very good.  Today we went in to buy a half dozen different pastries.  When I told the woman(another new employee) that I wanted a specific pastry she told me I could not choose what I wanted.  I informed the clerk that I had been a customer for a number of years and have always picked  out which pieces I wanted.  I was informed that the owner had told her(the clerk) to not let the customer choose..  We went ahead and bought but if this happens again I will not return.  There is another very good French bakery almost around the corner on Sahara that I will start to use.  If I wanted to have my product chosen for me I would shop at a pre-packaged store.  I do hope the owner reads this review and takes corrective action.
