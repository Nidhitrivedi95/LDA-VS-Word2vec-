HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw Very traditional french menu.  We had a few appetizers and one main between wife and I.  Note, we are already disappointed as foie gras was not on the menu the night we ate.  

Ambience was OK, but not anything special.  We dined later at night, so most people had moved on.  

The food:

Bone Marrow and oxtail jam:  Bone marrow was delicious, but the oxtail jam was way too salty.  

Escargot pie:  nothing special.

Crispy Duck Confit:  more meh...

Steak frites:  the steak was very good, and cooked perfectly.  Frites were above average.

So, in the end, this restaurant is a bit of a meh.  I could have easily gone to any one of several Bistros here in LA and had food just as good for 2/3 of the price.
