It is fancy, but not too fancy.  When my husband and I walked in, I was greeted with such a warm smile from the hostess.

While walking to our table, we were able to view the other rooms that were decorated in different ways.  My husband had informed me that each room had a different theme.  The ambiance from the whole restaurant was just perfect. 

I very much enjoyed our waiter.  He was very nice the whole time and didn't seem to be annoyed when I had asked a lot of questions about the menu.  He was also very kind in helping me pick out a wine, and also asked for what price range I was trying to stay in since he knew everything was expensive.  I felt like he was helping us look out for our wallets.  

All the food was amazing.  I just fell in love with the Escargot appetizer.  It was beautifully prepared that you would forget you were eating snail.  All of the food was a good portion size for what you are paying for.  Everything had a tasty flavor and was just perfection.

This place is a bit on the pricey side, but I would say that everyone should at least try it once in their life time.  Sharing it for a special occasion would be well worth it with great memories in a beautifully cozy restaurant.
