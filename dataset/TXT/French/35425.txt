htQgj-ANQpZGpIpkkrEmyQ I came to Inspire with HUGE expectations - in part due to the long waitlist to eat here, and also because of the other raving reviews I had read about. 

While the atmosphere and food is great, it definitely isn't as great as I had been expecting. I went with my entire family and we each tried different things (I had the Korean Sandwich). The meals were tasty and the service was very enjoyable, but I have had better fusion inspired food before.

This is definitely a great addition to the Markham food scene, especially for those who aren't interested in driving down to Toronto. Although there is nothing wrong with my experience, I think just expected more in terms of flavour and was a bit let down. Definitely worth checking out though!
