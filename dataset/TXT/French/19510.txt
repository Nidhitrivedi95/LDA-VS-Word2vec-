aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw This place has never failed me; chef Thomas Keller has never failed me. Last weekend was my third time here. Their pastries are always great and fresh. 

I love their banquette, croissants and cookies (he TLC cookies to be exact) I got the Thomas Keller dessert book; I knew each desserts have a special meaning behind it and how they made it to achieve the perfection.

Comparing this bakery and Carlo's bakery, which is also located at the same hotel, I would say hand down to Thomas Keller (sorry Buddy).
