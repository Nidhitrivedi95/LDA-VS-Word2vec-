BSmqxPbQglQwP2R56OqOag Went back to Local Bistro this week.....still a great experience! Nice gazpacho was a surprise for me....I love that stuff, and theirs is tasty and fresh. Friends had the gorgeous pappardelle with rich meat sauce...also linguine with seafood...my husband had a bite of a scallop and he told me it was divine! I did not like the drunk bread, because I felt that the wine made the bread soggy. Desserts were tasty, with Nutella cheesecake a fun treat. Always think of L.B. if you want great food and proper service.
