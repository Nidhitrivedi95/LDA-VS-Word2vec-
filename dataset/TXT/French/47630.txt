O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q We spontaneously decided to grab dinner here and weren't sorry. The steaks we had were cooked perfectly. The service was very friendly. The only thing keeping me from giving it five stars is that the waiter said that the soufflé was not being offered anymore since over a year which makes me wonder what it is still doing on the menu....
