4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw We went there with a couple locals and enjoyed the meal very much.  I had the Beef Wellington - something you don't see very often, and it was absolutely perfect.  Even the spinach that it came with was good, and I hate cooked spinach.
Service was excellent.
Only issue is the price - hefty, but by Las Vegas strip standards, it was a good deal.
