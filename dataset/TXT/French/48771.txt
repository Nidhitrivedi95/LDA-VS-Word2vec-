oJZNHz5UUVUgrZwVBVlpYw Afternoon tea on a busy Sunday. I like to to do afternoon tea in different cities when I travel with friends. Four of us dressed up and headed to tea Petrossian. Was expecting a little more quiet location away from smoky casino. I understand that it's vegas and there will be crowds but it was very loud during tea. We were inside the bar and most of the view was the casino :/ I was expecting a view of the fountains or gardens. The actual tea, sandwiches and treats were nice (nothing extraordinary) but for a snack they were nicer than bar food!  
The service lacked a bit. When we checked in the hostesses were not friendly and not even a smile to greet (basics of customer service). She seated us and walked away. Five minutes later a waitress arrived and seemed annoyed we didn't know the ordering process (how many sandwiches we were to order). After we ordered and received our food a gentlemen was refilling our hot water. Waitress was never seen again until it was time to pay.
Ok experience. If customer service was better I would recommend but since it was not even the basics then I would say save your money!
