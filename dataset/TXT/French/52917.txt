QeFsIMcIFIJcOrpthYL8jg This was my second time here and both times I had to have the lamb cavatelli!  I finished every last inch of it.  We started with the foie gras torchon via a recommendation from our amazing server.  My boyfriend had his first duck confit and now it's his favorite dish of all time!.  The live jazz is really nice.  Overall, a fantastic experience.
