Or23g875aIDTGNwKQASQgA Candide is definitely worth a visit. They were able to get our party of two in right away at the chef's table (a converted church pew, like much of the rest of the restaurant furniture).

The food was local, fresh, with many items from their garden just outside. The staff was extremely attentive and walked us through the menu and our selected dishes. The kitchen staff were methodical in an almost Zen way - no rushing, cursing, everything was done to set (and maintain) a peaceful relaxing tone.

Great way to end a busy and stressful week, really enjoyed, will go again next time I'm in town.
