hzyvL2v97xLzLbLXcdi1uw This restaurant is in the Shadyside shopping district and very near my hair salon (Whitehouse Salon -- highly recommended BTW) so stopped for lunch after getting my new hairdo.

The place is tiny but inviting.  As it was just myself, I opted for counter space sitting on a stool with no back, but there are several tables with chairs, as well.

The menu options are mostly crepes, divided into sweet and savory.  I opted for the Tivoli, a savory crepe with mozzarella, spinach, and tomato, with pesto sauce.  I wish they would use the Oxford comma because it is confusing on their menu as it is listed as "spinach, tomato and pesto sauce" which leads one to wonder if it contains tomatoes and has pesto sauce or if it contains tomato pesto sauce.  I was hoping it was the former and it was, gratefully.  

It comes with a side salad with house French vinaigrette dressing.  I thought the portions were excellent, the taste very good, and the price of 14.79 which included a diet coke to be fine for lunch.

I will say I loved it but, as far as wanting to return with my husband for a weekend breakfast?  I think the space is too small for a drive here specifically for this restaurant only to probably find it is very busy and there is no place inside to wait for a table.  Off-hour visits would be best.
