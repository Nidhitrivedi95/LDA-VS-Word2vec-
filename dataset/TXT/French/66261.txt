uP3H5bcsiTXM0k0xQhRndg This little hole in the wall near Notre-Dame is a mixed blessing. The wait was unpleasant at over 30 mins out in the cold but the food is phenomenal, everything we tried was fantastic!

Space is at a premium in this family-run place and they don't take reservations, hence the wait. Once inside, the ambiance is cozy and simple - very welcoming. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable about the menu - everything explained in detail, the fact that there are less than 10 items on the menu probably helps (desserts excluded).

We had the onion and jalapeño soup, smoked salmon, "Ultimate Experience" and the mac and cheese. The soup was creamy and nicely spiced. The Ultimate Experience was aptly named, I don't think I have ever eaten a better piece of pork in my life - excellent sauce, too. The meat literally melted on the tongue - an experience indeed. The mac and cheese was a little strange - with ham and cinnamon - but that was a very good combination as well. 

After having the home made cheesecake, I can die happy. The little stick of dark chocolate takes away from the cheesecake flavor, might as well leave that alone.

All in all: it was worth the wait - would certainly go again.

Note: In spite of a photo of Poutine on Yelp - this place does not serve Poutine! That was a one time thing and it's not on the menu.
