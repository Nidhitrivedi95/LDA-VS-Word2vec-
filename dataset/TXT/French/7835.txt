4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I had fillet mignon, salmon salad, and scallops. They were all amazinggg. Every food has a hint of sour taste. Even though I don't like anything sour it was still good. The only thing that wasn't so good were the fries that came with the steak. They were extremely salty and couldn't eat them after couple of them. Other than that, the food was amazing. Can't describe it any other way.
