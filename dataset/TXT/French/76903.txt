ysJo5Jdo29XOBCnKrbUKWg I desperately wanted to love Paris 66, but I just couldn't do it. I will say, right off the bat, that this restaurant had the best, most attentive, on-the-ball waitstaff of any restaurant I've ever been to in Pittsburgh. I can not say enough nice things about them.

However, everything else about the restaurant was simply underwhelming. We ordered beef burgundy (29$) and a lamb shank on special (28$). The beef was tender but completely overwhelmed by the salt pork flavor. The lamb, however, was hard as a brick on the outside. I literally had trouble putting my fork into portions of the meat because it had hardened up so much in the oven. The outside was like eating slightly soft beef jerky. 

The bottom line is, the food is FAR too expensive too be plagued by such problems. If this is their usual quality, I'm uncertain how they can compete with cheaper, better quality food such as Meat and Potatoes, Piccolo Forno, or even Salt or 11.

I would, however, recommend this place for their desserts. I would consider stopping here after an evening at another restaurant for dessert and coffee.
