4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Good french food and french vibe. 
Friendly wait staff and quick service.
We had hoped to sit outside and made a reservation, however outside seating is first come first served.  The allure for us was the outside, so we were a little disappointed.  
Dover sole was the specialty and delicious.  Steak frites was a classic and lived up to its reputation.  Creme Brulee - yum.
Escargot - it was ok - didn't seem to have the garlic/lemon pop I usually like, but the snails were tender and the bread warm and yummy.
