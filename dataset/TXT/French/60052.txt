sARavfidmIS878q5BtlyVQ What a wonderful evening we had at e! I was a bit hesitant considering all the hype about this restaurant but honestly I had such a wonderful time besides the fact I was with the most wonderful man on earth who was treating me to this very unique experience.  Be prepared for a lot of foam and truffles at e. The show is worth the golden ticket and the experience is one that will not be forgotten. Kudos to Cody and the staff who made the evening even more special.  The setting is intimate and cozy and fortunately for us our dining companions were also a delight to be with.  Molecular gastronomy is fun but not overly filling but still unique in flavor and texture.  Who could not like a place with 5 desserts?
