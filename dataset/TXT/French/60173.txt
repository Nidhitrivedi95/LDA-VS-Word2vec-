sbcMKOaLJTIYXpk0jDw7Fw Well in celebrating my 9 year anniversary since beign diagnosed with cancer there was only one place at the front of my mind that I wanted to try. That of course was Mark Greenaways new venture Bistro Moderne.

To start we had a nice glass of champagne, a fitting start to an occassion such as this. For my starter I went for the soft shell crab tempure. As MG has alluded to the bistry allows him to serve up dishes he coudlnt do in a fine dining setting and this is a prime example, big chunks of tasty crab in a light crispy tempura with a delicious dip.....happy JD.

For my main I went for the duck. This very intersting dish pairing tender duck with watermelon was a delight. Innovative, indulgent but somehow light this was a really good dish for savouring all of the elements. My dining partners and I shared a selection of the sides, the bag of garlic roast potatos were my favourtie.

Paired with a cracking bottle of red this was a great nigth, with great food and some exceptional service.

Bistro  Moderne comes highly JD Recommended!!!
