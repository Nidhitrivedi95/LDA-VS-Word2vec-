rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Service stands out more than the food and that's a good thing.  
We arrived for dinner before a show.  The food's very good.  
1. Half foie gras - banned in CA, so we have to sneak to Nevada for this. The creamiest foie gras I've ever had, in a tiny glass jar served with crunchy bread wedges, $25.
2. Beet salad - tasty beets with greens, $15.50
3. Onion soup, $9.75. Savory, condensed soup with tons of onion and topped with 2 slices of bread drenched with melted cheese.
4. Lamb - tasty slices of lamb, $33.95
5. Pan-seared Scottish salmon, $36.50.  The salmon was well done and I had asked for it to be medium rare, additionally, it was very salty. The only real disappointment in our meal.
6. Mille-Feuille dessert, $9.50, was OK.
Hubby had a glass of Rodney Strong Cabernet, $17 and coffee, $3.95.

We had nice quiet meal until a group of loud, boisterous, Southern men were seated in the large table next to us.  The one behind me pulled out his chair to sit down and bumped my chair didn't even apologize. The talked loudly about business thru the rest of our meal which made us want to run out of there.  When you spend that kind of money for dinner, you don't want loud and rude people seated next to you.
