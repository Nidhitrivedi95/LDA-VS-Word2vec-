BSmqxPbQglQwP2R56OqOag We have always liked this place a lot, despite the usual cacophony exacerbated by the brick wall & high ceilings. Last night seemed even louder than usual, and neither the food nor the service was up to their usual standards. My gazpacho was good (albeit quite small), but only moderately chilled. The truffle Mac & cheese was noticeably lacking any truffle flavoring, and my wife's pork tenderloin with peach sauce had no apparent sauce. It also took quite a long time to be waited on & to get our entrees. We made reservations at at early time (6:00), but still got seated at one of the small tables in the back where one person has to sit on the long cushion. I am short and sitting here did not allow me to have any back support. We will likely return at some point, but not soon.
