AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw Delicious! I had a wonderful crepe with banana and nutella; the husband had a breakfast crepe with ham and cheddar cheese. Light and delicious, completely satisfying. It was so nice to have a delicious, quick bite that didn't cost an arm and a leg. I would go back again in a heartbeat.
