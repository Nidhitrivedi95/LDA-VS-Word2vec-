AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw So delicious! So expensive! Everything here is so beautiful and delicate. Carefully made and so elegantly put together. No wonder they price it the way they do. The only thing is that it is expensive so some items may or may not have been sitting on display for some time.. I tried the pistachio cream éclair with fresh raspberries it was amazing. Also the 6 Pac of French Macarons (well over priced) those were okay not as fresh as I'd like them to be for the price.. but honestly Macarons in general are completely overpriced.
