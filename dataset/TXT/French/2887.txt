The owner/bartender was visibly unhappy with us as soon as we declined drinks, and when asked if she had anything non-alcoholic, was quick was a simple, curt "No." and just walked away.  Our second server which much nicer, and was happy to help us pick the grilled whole branzino and the quail. I was OK with my fish, which was pretty well prepared and finished with brown butter.  My husband's quail, however, was ostentatiously priced at $18 for what was basically half a quail (if you aren't familiar with quail, picture your fist, then cut that size in half, and that's what you're left with). It's fine if it were offered as an appetizer, but to try and pass it off as a main dish left an empty belly and an over all negative impression.  Sad, because the place looked charming, but we'd basically never come back again.
