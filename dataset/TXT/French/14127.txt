58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw Location: Tucked away in the Old Port. The closest subway is Square Victoria, street parking is available but good luck with that. If you're downtown, it's an easy walk so you can skip transit if you want to get some cardio in.

The place: Le Cartet is not excessively big but the layout is good, with simple decor and a pretty plentiful boutique at the front. There's usually a line-up on weekends so you'll want to plan accordingly. We arrived around 10:45 and had to wait, but only for about 15-20 minutes. 

The goods: I went for the 2 eggs with goat cheese on toast, with a side of potatoes (like, about 4 of them). Can't say one bad thing about this simple but tasty breakfast. The eggs were perfectly scrambled and fluffy and had the right amount of cheese, the bread was fantastic (a multigrain, I think) and the potatoes were good. They also know how to make a mean Macchiato, which always makes me happy since many places do not. Quality goods, all around.

Service: The service was good, though the waiter couldn't seem to get our bills right. He had to reprint them twice, and both times, they were wrong.   

Price point: I forget the exact amount, but it was on par with other breakfast places in town. 

Their storefront boutique offers a ton of stuff - so if you're in the area and want to grab something real quick, stop in!
