I particularly enjoyed their cocktails, which were curious and creative - a fig and date martini came with a "chaser" of blue cheese and their "red russian" was a fresh blend of pressed apple and beet juice.

We indulged in a few oysters and scallops from the raw bar, which were tasty but ended up being a fair chunk of the bill (which should have been expected, but that's what happens when you don't ask when the waiter is tempting you with the selection).  

Our food (cerf tartare, gnocchi & coleslaw between the two of us) was otherwise pretty decent though not outwardly spectacular by my Montreal resto standards, with the exception of the filet mignon which stood out as being melt-in-your mouth tender.
