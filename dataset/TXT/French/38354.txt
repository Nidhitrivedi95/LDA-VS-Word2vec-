JezHN-9KKLTMbojq00VP0g Almost 3 years since my initial review and I still frequent Le Petit on a regular basis. A craving tends to pop up for me that I just can't ignore! I've taken so many friends and family over the years that it's become everyone's favorite place.

A few updates since last time: 

- There are now two dining rooms; the small triangular room you enter into, and the larger room to the side. Both are decorated simply, yet pretty and inviting. There are also now 3 restrooms (a unisex one upstairs in the second room and one for each men and women down in the little basement).
- Just recently, they changed their daily quiche from a piece cut from a larger pie to an individual, puff-pastry portion. Still comes with raisin bread and a salad. I thought it was amazing, and great value for the money.
- A year or two ago, one of the servers who I've gotten to know gave me a sample of a drink titled the "Corpse Reviver." I laughed at him when he said the name, but I now get it every time I want something a little stronger. Just as it sounds, it's the perfect "hair of the dog" if you imbibed a wee bit too much the night before. And even if not, it tastes so fresh and citrusy.
- I finally went here for dinner and I can vouch that it's just as delicious, intimate and amazing. A great date spot, whether for a special meal or even the every day.

Long story short, the quality of Le Petit consistently keeps me coming back. Sometimes it gets crowded and the meal may take awhile, but that adds to the charm. We go to different places for different experiences, and this is one of a leisurely pace. I love you Le Petit!
