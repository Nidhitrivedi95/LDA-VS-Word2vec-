VwZhwflLnTq19aAeFLJHCQ Was excited to learn that a quality restaurant was finally opening at this spot on Sunset Road that has been many different restaurants over the years.  Dined there  Saturday evening, March 8. Nice to see that the place was busy with activity. But as soon as I walked in there was an overpowering smell of ammonia. I immediately said to myself that no matter how good the food was, I would never return. Well I guess I got used to the disinfectant smell while dining on fantastic food and wine. The margarita flat bread was outstanding (topped with fresh greens), and the steak au poive with pomme frites as close to what I've had in France. Our waitress deserves to be in the running of best waitress of 2014 (if such an award exists). 

There is an outdoor eating area and I am looking forward to returning there. My only suggestion is that they make this area "warmer looking" as the façade of the restaurant itself is not attractive. As Spring in Vegas arrives, an outdoor dining area will attract those who want to dine under the stars, and creating an inviting ambiance in which to do so would be most welcome!
