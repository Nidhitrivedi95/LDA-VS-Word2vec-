QeFsIMcIFIJcOrpthYL8jg Hands down the best lamb chops I've ever had. Perfect seasoning (Rosemary of course) and perfectly grilled to medium. I also had a bite of the mussels and even though I'm not a huge fan of fennel, it was subtle and worked with the mussels. Overall, great experience and great meal.
