rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Forget Paris, go to Bouchon. It is closer.  No wonder anyone u ask at the Venetian tells u this place is the best. High prices but worth it. Amazing steak, perfect service. Even the butter was amazjng. The service was perfect but they had a mamager walking around checking to make sure all was perfect for everyone. I also tried their bakery next to the elevators and that was great as well. This place will cost double any place else, but it is certainly worth it. Next year, same place.
