4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Absolutely fantastic!  Be sure and make a reservation though, the wait will be long on the weekends.  We split the pitcher of red sangria, which was really good, springs of rosemary and huge pieces of fruit.  They bring out a bagutte and butter to start.  I ordered a classic quiche with bacon, jarlsberg cheese, caramelized onions.  it came with a small side salad and the quiche was so rich!  The flavors just blended well together.  He got the brunch special that day which was an open faced sandwich with cheese, bacon and dates, another winner.  The dates didn't overpower the dish. The waitress were great, so helpful and friendly.  This is one of my favorite brunches in Vegas and will definitively go again!
