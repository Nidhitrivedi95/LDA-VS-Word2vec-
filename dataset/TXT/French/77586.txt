My college roommate and I had crammed a 5 day work week into 4.  We had 9:30 reservations @ Fleur de Lys.  Landed at the airport and decided, no, we were too hungry to check in first and then head to the restaurant.  So we cabbed straight there.  8:30 seated, no problem.  Whew.  Our foodie adventure begins.

Spring for the grand marnier souffle.  You won't regret it.

We shared a $55 prix fixe menu with a second entree.

Course one: truffled onion soup with braised duck crêpe, red onion purée and black truffle.  Yes, it's as good as it sounds.  Actually, it may even be better.

Course two: stout braised beef short ribs with leek fondue, whole grain mustard and cornichons.  The stout is actually a Guinness reduction, which was perfect since it was Guinness' birthday.  Two birds with one stone!

Course 2.5: gently heated Alaskan king salmon with Juilinee root vegetables, apple rosemary puree and horseradish chive bouillon.  Soft, buttery and flaky to the touch.

Repeat: spring for the grand marnier souffle.  You won't regret it.  You have to order it right when you sit down, since it takes about 20 minutes to perfect.  Just do it.  Trust.

In addition to the meal, we had a choice of freshly baked bread, complimentary appetizer and complimentary dessert.

They know how to treat a girl well ;)
