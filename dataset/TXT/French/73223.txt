XrOmn4si9IIQig3Yz1X-mw My wife, 14 month old son and I ended up here after I read an email from T***advisor about pubs in Edinburgh, then started wandering around that site.  This caught my eye, so when another reservation fell through, this popped into my head.

The restaurant is underneath the Salisbury Hotel, just off Newington Road.  There's a small car park outside the hotel.  The restaurant notes itself as being child friendly, and we certainly experienced a genuine effort there - definitely one of the most friendly in Edinburgh.  There is even a play area for kids at the back of the hotel, although we didn't try it out this time.

The decor inside is nice and clean, and at lunchtime on a Sunday there was a nice buzz.  This place clearly has built up a regular custom, and all of the staff were chatting away and really helped make the place feel welcoming.

The menu is very nice.  A nice selection to choose from, with some tasty dishes, just different enough to interest, not too strange to scare.  I had poached pear on gingerbread covered in cheese to start, and my wife had mussels in a very tasty sauce.  Our mains of confit duck (again, very good) and beef (tasty) were nicely presented and good sized portions, well put together.  Our son's risotto was also very tasty.

For desert, we didn't stray too far from safety, with a tart tatin and a creme brulee.

Overall, it's a very nice restaurant doing some great food with truly engaging & knowledgeable staff.  They cater very well for kids.  I'll definitely be going back, sooner rather than later.
