4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Worst restaurant I've ever been to. Feel like most overhyped places are bad as people get caught up with group think. Seafood crepe and eggs Benedicts were about as good as breakfast I cook at home with a microwave. I couldn't even finish the food. Paid 70+ for two. There was this one time where I had a really bad day. I found out my ex girlfriend cheated on me with a fat ladyboy. That same ladyboy also ended up beating my ass in a fight. Destroyed I went home to cuddle with my dog. I find out that the ladyboy cooked my dog for dinner for my ex gf. Finally at the end of the day after sitting on the toilet I also realized I ran out of toilet paper. That day was still better than my experience at this restaurant.
