Tl2nqtPXlLbAG3qkUYVM2g Impeccably chic & effortlessly warm experience dining here at Vincent. We dined with a reservation for 4 on a Friday evening at 6:30. We were seated to the right in a table with candles and roses on the table.

Throughout the experience, our dining host shared tid bits about the local produce, how they prepare the dishes, and an overall knowledge of the menu.  He mentioned that he has worked with Vincent for 23 years- and trust me, it shows!

We started with drinks which I enjoyed champagne with st Germaine.  Others in my group had gin & tonics and a Jack & diet.

Starters:
Salmon quesadilla- yum and good for a group
Froi gras- did not try
Smoked salmon & crab salad- love the endive and nectarine!
Tomato gazpacho
Lobster, corn, & avocado salad- looked absolutely fabulous.

Entrees:
Veal 
Lamb (2)
Maine Lobster (me- outstanding!)

Dessert:
Flourless chocolate cake (not on menu)
Apple tarte- with a happy birthday & candle for our guest of honor.
Lemon meringue crepe soufflé
Cafe au lait
Coffee
Compliments of the chef- mini chocolate cakes with sea salt for all (we all got to take these to go) 

We were all feeling relaxed & enjoying the lovely experience lingering beyond 2 1/2 hours. This dinner was my favorite I've had the pleasure to experience in quite a while.
