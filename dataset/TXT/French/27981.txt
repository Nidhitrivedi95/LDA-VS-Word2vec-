dWAyhGhxfVvtLj3nPLT1DQ This place was amazing!  The service was not a 100% but i admit it was very busy when we arrived, also they redeemed them selves by acknowledging the slower service and apologized.  The food was portioned according to its price.  The French Onion Soup and Muscles were great. Also the gnocchi and steak frites were very flavorful.  The sticky toffee was GREAT!, the black forest was not so great (Dry and disappointing).  Great wine selection and best of all, friendly service.  They also have prix fix during certain times.  
2 appatizers, 2 mains, 2 deserts, glass of wine and Diet Coke was around $100 plus tip.
