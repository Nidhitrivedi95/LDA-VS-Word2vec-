The chocolate mousse cup is the largest I have ever seen (the size of a big cupcake)!  The cappuccino was great and the tartine (with pimento cheese, tomato and basil) and the spinach leek soup was well-balanced and perfectly seasoned.
The decor is fun and eclectic.  It was very busy-- since I went on a Saturday in the early afternoon, but the dining room was ample enough to accommodate everyone.  I would like to go back on a weekday morning to try some of their breakfast options.
