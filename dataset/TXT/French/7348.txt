4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I was a bit hesitant to try this place at first because of my awful experiences over at Sugar Factory (also in the Paris), however I'm glad I decided to come here!  

My first visit I got:
-Escargots de Bourgogne: snails seasoned with a tasty green garlic sauce, served on a sizzling plate
-Filet Mignon Merlot : steak was about 8-10 oz. and had a delicious sauce with it
-Frites: side that comes with the steak, they are basically thinly sliced french fries which complimented my steak quite well!
-Frangria: their take of sangria and each glass only costs about $5.50...just get it

My second visit I got:
-Escargots de Bourgogne again
-Bacon Wrapped Pork Tenderloin (Special): comes with mashed potatoes and an apple and fennel salad, the entire plate was delicious 
-Steak Au Poivre:  (boyfriend's dish) very generous serving of a flattened steak seasoned with peppercorn, also very good
-Frangria again

The service was excellent and everyone was friendly.  If you decide to come here just make sure you book a reservation because the wait here can be long (patio seating is first come first serve).
