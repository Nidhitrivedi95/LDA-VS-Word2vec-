4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I wish I could give it more stars! This is easily my most favorite restaurant in the world. I go to Las Vegas at least once a year and have eaten at Mon Ami Gabi many times for breakfast, lunch and dinner and have always, always, always had superior food. If possible, I like to sit outside, where the Bellagio fountains and the people watching put on a show that's tough to beat. Nevertheless, it's the food that keeps me coming back. Makes me want to hop on a plane right now!!
