rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I would only suggest eating at Bouchon for breakfast. Because the dinner was OVERHYPED.

IT IS THE BEST BREAKFAST IN LAS VEGAS. PERIOD. I mean for one, it is the the elegantly-lux Venetian. Second, Thomas Keller? You can't get anything else from him unless you go to Per Se in New York or French Laundry in Napa. So if you want a piece of him go for Bouchon and meet in the middle.

For breakfast I enjoyed the Croque Madame. Sounded neat, tasted phenomenally. Toasted ham and cheese on brioche. I can drink the Mornay sauce as if it was water to live. Put it all over my face why dont you. Comes served with Keller's version of Pomme Frites. I've had better fries but rightfully tasty in its own self. Also tried the Oeuf Au Gratin. it was eh.

Definitely a place if you want to impress a chick. Won't cost you much. Gorgeous in and outside. The breakfast will start up your whole entire day in Las Vegas.

Only thing that prys me away from giving Bouchon a five star rating on Yelp.com is the service. Went a couple of times and all those times the service sucked donkey balls. I don't think their PR or Keller himself would like to hear that but that's the truth.
