LQ_gYNs5E10IGFE0NOyD7A Owner is super cool. Our waiter was awesome too. The vibe and ambience is really neat. Great music. The food was good. My pork dish was cold so I couldn't dig it. But the eggs in a basket was deeelish!

The Bloody Mary was out of this world and full of celery asparagus pickle and a lime!
The bottomless mimosa was good for my tracker partner who can't day drink and got buzzed off three mimosas. 


If you're in AZ and want to chill at a cool spot w good food go here for dinner. They have awesome food and won the culinary food award in the fashion and food contest on Friday April 10.
