jalA5zHW8ZfY3RSPG7oDxQ Wasn't sure what to expect of Cafe Du Jour when some coworkers, my wife and I decided to get together for dinner there on a Saturday night.

Unsuspecting exterior (sans the deliciously good smells wafting from the open front door), very small space (less than 10 tables total), and a rather compact open kitchen all in the same room.

We had been meaning to try it for awhile on a count of the Yelp reviews, and overall, I can see where it gets the positive vibe.  All of our appetizers were great (mushroom and pork crostini, meatballs, etc.) and the BYOB made the environment enjoyable from the start.

Everyone at the table seemed to at least like their appetizers, although the pork chop my one coworker and I got was way overdone (rather tough and dry everywhere but the center).  Service was decent and the staff were definitely friendly.  Judging by they appetizers versus the entrees, I can definitely see this being a better lunch spot than a dinner joint (not necessarily a problem!).  I'd imagine their sandwiches are definitely good.

Overall, we enjoyed our experience.  Not exactly sure we'd seek it out again, but then again, we very rarely frequent one place more than once every year or two (we like our variety!).
