xcmmTXhuMx2fZF2Bt69F4w Went in for Sunday Brunch with high expectations.  Without my GPS, I am not sure that we could have found this place!  I wanted to bring my BF here for the mussels and I was in the mood for some spectular waffles!   Sorry to say, it didn't live up to our expectations.  Seating was crapped, service slow and the food was okay.  The moules were nothing special and my waffles were a little cold.  We also shared an omelette which was decent.  I know everyone loves this place.  But I am sure that we will not be making a second trip.
