Oa6lAWLfFFvtroxO7f0JLA My lovely wife and I celebrated our 20th anniversary here and it was amazing. We had the candlelit romantic dinner for two. Each course was paired with a wine. Our 1st  course was salmon, 2nd, was a salad in a glass (very yummy and cool), 3rd was a goat cheese tart, 4th was the main - charlois beef and 5th was a delish chocolate mouse. We also had an amuse bouche of smoked trout. The wines consisted of red, white, Sekt and a port for dessert. Highly recommended for that special night out.
