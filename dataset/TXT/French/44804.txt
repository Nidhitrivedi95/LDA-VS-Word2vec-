mr4FiPaXTWlJ3qGzp4-7Yg This hidden gem is wonderfully delicious. Ordered from appetizers to entré. Everything is great. Great service, great food, great environment. Can't complain about a thing here. Even their bathrooms are sparkly clean. Heard They're moving to another location soon or renovating. Better call ahead and ask. Duck confit and their pasta in beurre sauce is mind blowing. Worth a try If you're in the area. Something different for date night.
