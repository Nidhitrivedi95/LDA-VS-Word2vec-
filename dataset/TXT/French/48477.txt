ohMpNug5zWNxOlL6ShG7Ig Literally we have walked out 3 times in the evening due to either NO service or RUDE attitude. Live close by so gluten for punishment. Lunch is incredible flavors, great service, and expensive. Last night the two of us we walked in @ 8:15 they close at 9, the bartender/host/server said we couldn't have the 4 top because it was RESERVED?! He and the Mgr were obviously more concerned with closing duties than accommodating us spending our $100+. We are finished.......I promise!
