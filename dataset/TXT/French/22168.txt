BSmqxPbQglQwP2R56OqOag Disappointing. My wife and I went yesterday for dinner with another couple. I informed the restaurant when making the reservation through opentable that we were there to celebrate my wife's birthday. They sat us right away but there was an attitude and a sense of negativity from our server the entire night. It started with her requesting that we order the appetizer and main course at the same time. She agreed that she would manage the timing, and she did, but I thought it was an odd request. Next I ordered a beer. When she brought it to the table she said in a nasty tone, "do you NEED me to pour it in your glass for you". I did request the glass but I told her I would be more than happy to pour it myself. She just made us feel that she had something more important to do every time she came by. I think the final straw was when the main course was served and mine was missing. Close to 5 minutes later she brought it out and simply placed it in front of me and walked away. An apology would have been nice. I understand we all have bad days and it's quite possible she was simply having one of those. I just expected more from a place with such wonderful reviews. Oh and we didn't need a song or free dessert but a simple gesture of a birthday wish would have been nice knowing that was the reason we came in that night.
