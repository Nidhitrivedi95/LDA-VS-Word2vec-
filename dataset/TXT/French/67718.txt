UxWH8zRYIBgs6Q2oykvRdw Great atmosphere, and decor. I was here for a birthday event involved twenty people. The good thing is I had the chance to try out many different appetizers from this restaurant. 

I would say most of them are having very good presentation, yet not much attention has been put on the food itself. The sesame asparagus frit per se is such an awesome idea, deep fried sesame is already a promise for the rich flavor and fragrance. With the crispy asparagus, I would imagine it will be such an amazing dish! However, the end result was the sesame was burned because of deep frying too long,  asparagus was soggy, and the frit was very greasy, usually a result of lukewarm oil. This is a very disappointing dish with great concept, which I will definitely try it out at home. The other appetizer like scallop, pontine, tar tar, nochalos, are all on the same line. They are great idea, but poor execution. 

The main dish was slightly better, even though my friend didn't like it at all. It was a lamb stew in tomato sauce, the lamb was tendered enough, and flavorful. Sauce was rich, typical for French cuisine. 

As a conclusion, it could be a better restaurant, if the quality can be maintained. I hope management can see this post and make certain changes to bring the best out of its great menu.
