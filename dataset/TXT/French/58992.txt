rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w We went to Le Cirque to celebrate my partner's 30th birthday. It had been on our list for awhile, but always put it off for a special occasion. We were a group of 10 on a Saturday night, so I was worried that they would not be able to accommodate us. Everything worked out perfectly though! Our somm Fred was very knowledgeable, and our table host was also excellent. I had the citrus risotto, chicken, and chocolate ball from the pre-theater menu. All were excellent - particularly the chicken and chocolate ball - the chocolate tasted high quality, and was appreciated. The one issue that we had was that we were not told we would be charged for water, and would have been happy with tap water if that was offered to us - instead we ended up paying over $70 for water, which seems silly. Overall though, a great experience and would recommend. It was great for a large group, but I imagine would be even better in a small group or as a couple.
