Dw83Qgi-FSYeuD_gJwwycg The staff was awesome! Very friendly and knowledgeable.
Fantastic cocktails! They have daily specials and a great menu. Very satisfied overall. If I could change something I would add more veggies on the plate and use a tad less salt!
But it was good enough that I would go back happily!
