3FlWR_osNPb8dcqLgHebHw We decided to go to Mimi's Cafe for dinner. Hadn't been there is a bazillion years, but it seemed like the thing to do. We had good food but a really strange experience with the waiter. I ordered a glass of their house red wine with my meal and when it arrived the amount looked smaller than what I expected. About an ounce less. I mentioned it to the waiter and he assured me that it was only "because the glass was large that the amount looked smaller," Yeah! I wasn't going to make a fuss over it, even though people being served at other tables had more wine in their glasses. We ordered coffee afterwards (and none of the plates were removed) and waited and waited. I noticed that our waiter was nowhere to be found and asked another waiter what was the deal. The manager came to our table and apologized, saying she had to let our waiter go! She said several other customers were complaining about his service. I mentioned the wine and she removed it from the bill. All in all the strangest experience with waiters in Vegas. Vegas does produce high quality waiters since there is a demand for it, and Mimi's Cafe did provide good food. But we shall wait a bit longer before going back.
