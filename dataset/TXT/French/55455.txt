rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Not a memorable meal. The look is high end and the service is good but the food left a lot to be desired. If this is what Thomas Keller puts his name on...don't believe the hype. I had been looking forward to experiencing on of his restaurants and I can positively say to those in Vegas that you can skip this one.
