Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA Here is what I can tell you about The Mix, it is a mix of the following;

people on overpriced alcohol
people on *e*
people on shrooms
people on acid
people on pot

okay, and whatever all of the people I didn't know were doing. 

All of this would seem to make for a happy experience. Especially while enjoying an unbelievable view of the strip after being whisked upstairs by the most adorable elevator operator who had hair that rivals Savs and a pinstripe suit that was neither too trendy nor too retro to not just be totally fucking cool. 

Too bad the door guy downstairs was a lying judgmental piece of shit. Thank God I only encountered the elevator guy, because had I run into the door guy I would have had to knock off more stars than I already did just hearing the stories about him.
