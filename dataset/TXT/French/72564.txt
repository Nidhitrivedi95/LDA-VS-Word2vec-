XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q My first dinning experience here.

The lady working next door, required my husband to change his dress shoes with laces and khakis pants.  We had to change the reservation an hour later to go shop. As we got to the restaurant, I saw Caucasian male diners wearing tennis shoes, and some in khakis as well?????  

It's a neat place, and food was good except the spaghetti dish really throw me off.  The pasta was undercooked!! I had a stomach issue this morning after consuming the pasta.  And the mash potato side appeared and tasted like a stick of butter!!! 

Portion wise it's pretty decent comparing to the rest of the French tasting I've had.
