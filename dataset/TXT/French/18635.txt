aervNtqzrKf0CGrFo4xfKw This was our second time at Le Papillon, having first had a bad experience shortly after their opening.

We sat down for about 10 minutes before anyone asked us for a drink - it's the kind of place where staff avert their eyes so as to avoid eye contact.  My water glass was empty for most of the meal

We had the poutine, tourtiere, and steak frites.  While the poutine was good, the steak frites was not cooked to order (not even close), and the salad accompanying the tourtiere was dressed with a solution so saline you couldn't eat it.  Also - the wine selection is cheap and tastes like it.   

The crowd is very unlike most L-vill restaurants - definitely skewing silver, and perhaps more forgiving of mediocre food and awful service.   At last a restaurant that makes eddie levesques look polished and welcoming.
