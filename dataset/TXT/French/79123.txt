ZdaZwXC0FByDY3EwNELphw Brunch and Dinner, I've eaten at Union a number of times and I've never left disappointed.  The ingredients are local, fresh and delicious and the hands in the open-air kitchen cook everything to perfection.  My personal favourite was the Côte de Bœuf for two, a gorgeous single rib cut of aged beef that was large enough to feed us twice.  The menu changes due to the nature of ingredients' availability, but if you happen to come across the sausages on the brunch menu, jump at the chance to tuck into these house-made treats.
