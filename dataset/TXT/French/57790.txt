It's been quite a while since I've been here... Waaaay back when Olivier(Baguette Cafe) was still the manager here. 2005 B.Y.(Before Yelp) to be exact. A bunch of us came out to celebrate Terri R.'s birthday, and what a great time it was!

I've only dined here for lunch and dinner, so I was excited to dine here for Sunday Brunch because breakfast/brunch is my favorite meal time. What I like about brunch is that you have both sweet and savory options available and the menu selections here did not disappoint! We started with a pastry assortment of a Blueberry Streusel Muffin, Apple Danish, Almond Croissant, and Pecan Sticky Bun. Each one had its own distinct flavor and was very good.

I must add that our waiter Homero was a SUPERSTAR from beginning to end! The service provided by him and his team of runners and busers added to our stellar dining experience. Everyone's entrees looked delicious, and I went for the Corned Beef Hash which came with two eggs and brioche toast. Wifey got the popular Croque Madame which has been on the menu since day one(I helped open the flagship location in Yountville) the taste was the same, but I think the brioche slices have gotten thinner.
My Corned Beef hash was delicious and a very generous portion too. A very good choice if you choose to dine here for brunch.

 Towards the end of our meal, we were also surprised to see that checks were split(we had a party of 15) and no auto-gratuity wasn't on the bill which is totally unheard of these days, especially on the strip, I just hate auto-grat period, and we've all dealt the calculating BS when a restaurant doesn't honor split checks when it should be part of their job...no headaches on this day, and it was done with no problem. Thanks again Terri for organizing this fun and memorable day!  ALOHA!!!
