4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I LOVE LOVE LOVE this restaurant. 

I'm probably a sucker for it because my family had a special dinner there for my dad the first time I was there and everything was just PERFECT. The pinot noir bottle that my boyfriend had bought was smooth, light, and delicious with dinner. The bartender had suggested it and it was excellent- she was highly knowledgeable. 

We had escargot for appetizer- my first time and loved it!

Lobster and steak was cooked to perfection, savory, buttery, and all that healthy stuff. ;p

BUT the view.. the view was so nice. We were front and center outdoor patio where you caught the water show at the Bellagio every 15 mintues. I LOVED it. It was a free show with dinner!

The only reason I didnt give it a 5 star was because yelp doesn't do half stars and the second time I came was with my boyfriend and we were stuck in the way back. I was able to see the show but unfortunately was not able to watch it with him. It's a hit or miss when you get seated here. But the view of the water show does make the difference for me. 

FOOD is YUM. Thats a 5 star all the way.  Scallops and bone in rib-eye. BOMB!

Have not been here for brunch or lunch but have heard delectable things!
