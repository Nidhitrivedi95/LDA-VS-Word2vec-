Walking in to the restaurant, it felt like I was transported to Paris. Yes, I can say this. I've been. The checkered floors and bar really brought me back. Not that I was by any means drinking as a 15 year old in France. Although I probably could have. The menu reflected adherence to classic French cuisine.

FOOD

I had the Sautéed Duck Confit Salad || Duck sits atop spinach, radishes, croutons and green bean. I loved the different take on duck confit and the fact that it was such a light meal. 

OVERALL

All in all, I was so full from breakfast and lunch meals. I wish I had had the room for dessert. I will certainly come back to try some! The atmosphere and food really made for a great meal.
