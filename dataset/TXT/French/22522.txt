bVgRVpdPgwHBLa7RHb9CpQ PROS:

1. Nice ambiance, relaxed, casual, classy, small, cozy. I'd consider it a good place to take my parents  (ie., not for the young'ns)

2. Servers were professional, quick and friendly.

CONS:

1.Food was comme ci comme ca. 
I had a stuffed pasta thingy-ma-bobber that I wasn't too fond of. Next time I would get a meatier dish or salad which I noticed a lot of the other customers were later raving about. 

OVERALL:

-If I were to consider a restaurant for bistro food, Le Cap Vert would NOT be my first thought because I know I could get better bistro food in Old Port. However, if I'm stuck on St Cat's it's not a bad choice compared to a generic 3 brasseurs.
