rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw Brunch here was fantastic! A true French bistro that exceeded our expectations. Delicious foie gras to start on homemade bread.

We also ordered the burger which was amazing flavor. Probably one of the best burgers I've ever had. Our server explained the process of them grinding to different types of meat together. Quite delicious without being overfilled from the bun. Of course paired with perfect fries that was so light and airy.

Their ham Benedict on croissants was a nice change to the traditional Benedict. Great sized portions to share.

Service was excellent, would highly recommend!
