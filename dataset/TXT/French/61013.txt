However, it's very comfortable and accepting - meaning you will feel at home from the staff as a nice little stop in your day, a nice little spot to get away from it all for a moment.  The crepe fillings, as others have said, definitely make up for the flavor of the bland and a bit tough crepe batter they use, so choose your filings wisely knowing you'll want stronger flavors.  It does come with syrup if you get a savory crepe and the syrup isn't that super by Canadian standards, but it makes it nice and it's fun for you if you haven't tried this in Canada yet.  They have a range of special cocktails and wines and beers as well as of course the typical non-alcoholic beverages on offer.  So it's kind of worth it if you are in the area touring to just sit down and have a decent meal in a comfortable spot.  However, if you want real Montreal crepes, go to the Jean-Talon Market.  There is a stand there that is fantastic and the syrup is truly A+.
