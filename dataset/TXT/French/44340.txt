ME6D5nLlfG0xZCtICOYDuw I may have found my new favorite restaurant!  I dined at Georges Brasserie last weekend to celebrate a friend's birthday, and had a wonderful time.  The food was great, and the service even better!  Our group of five was seated on the lovely patio.  We started off with a cheese plate, and our server was so helpful and well informed.  He explained the different selections, and made excellent wine and beer recommendations as well (try the Blanche de Bruxelles) .  The complimentary bread and butter was terrific.  My filet mignon was cooked to perfection, and my companions enjoyed their meals of duck and a grouper special  Finally we ordered a creme brulee to share for dessert, and it was served with a birthday candle and a chocolate "Happy Birthday" decoration.  

We loved our visit and I would recommend this restaurant to anyone.  I will definitely be back, and try to sit on the patio once again.
