or4UVDjXEEjze3wNPjoAZA I took my daughter for a late lunch (she was visiting from LA), because we have good memories eating here when she was younger.  We were seated outside, maybe three feet from the entrance door- and some tables are too close together. I don't want to hear in public about a stranger's (or anyone's) recent surgery, especially while eating (and I am a nurse). The server immediately seemed rushed and inattentive. My daughter ordered the crab crepe, which was excellent- it should be for $21. I ordered the burger, based on the "gourmet" menu description- it was nothing special- maybe a dollop of Dijon would improve it, but no condiments were offered. A local Delux burger is much better, for half the price.  The server asked once, long after we were served (by a kitchen runner- not him) how the meal was- in that affected, fake manner of not really caring what the response was, because he was rapidly turning and walking away as he asked. I said it was "ok" but could have said it was repulsive and he would have had the same far-away, no eye contact gaze and robotic response, "great". He then disappeared for 20 minutes after our meals were finished. My daughter had left to make business calls in our car, and I had to ask the water server to please chase down the meal server. I would have asked sooner, but a gaggle of four noisy, older male doctors (they were talking about their jobs) were then crammed around the two-top cafe table next to me- with one shaking my hand (?) and chatting with me (I think prompted by pre-meal cocktails elsewhere). Zinc Bistro's French influenced choices seem to be as consistently delicious as remembered, and the weather was beautiful for outdoor dining, but the service was lacking. A $45 lunch without alcohol is not modest in Arizona. Perhaps the bored server needs to "un-bore" himself in a job that doesn't require being attentive to customers.
