We placed our beverage order right away,  asking for waters (we had been in a long walk! ). Our water never arrived,  And another server arrived to ask if we would like to order drinks.  We both requested coffee, and water again. Two coffees arrived,  And one water (whatever,  we'll  share). Neither of the servers we encountered were very friendly,  although they were not rude at all. We can forgive mediocre service, as it was quite busy. 
We emptied our coffees, and waited to place our orders. We waited about 10 minutes,  which seemed like a long wait as we had already been sitting about 20 minutes total. I will say the option of medium or dark roast coffee is a nice to have.
My eggs Benedict were flavorless, which was so disappointing. Hollandaise sauce is something I only treat myself to once in awhile and this one tasted nothing like the buttery thick and smooth sauce I was going for. 
The breakfast burrito was dry,  And not very exciting for a Mexican brunch restaurant. 
Our"bottomless " coffees were only refilled once, and come in very small mugs. We were lacking in caffeine ayy the end of our meal.

The pricing seemed very high for the quality of the food and service we received. Having noticed that most people rate this restaurant very high,  we might try again and hope that this was an "off" day....but not any time soon.
