mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q Had it been three years ago, I would have given L'Atelier 5 shiny stars because it was, has been, and continue to be (at least in my mind) one of the best dining experiences I've had in Vegas and with most one Michelin stars in my life.

However, on a recent return visit I felt slightly differently about it ...

But I still love dining at their open kitchen bar. The atmosphere, the environment, the seeing the prep part ... those were all quite amazing. I highly recommend this spot still, but maybe go and try the big daddy Joel Robuchon instead because I imagine that place is amazing.

The first time I came, they actually made us wait for our table a bit, so we ended up in Joel Robuchon's lounge where the expertly curated table of whiskeys greeted us along with a very very knowledgable bartender / whiskey expert. It was a very enjoyable experience even though it started because we had to wait for our table. 

However, the 2nd time, they seated us at a table instead of the bar ... so maybe that's why. But I also thought the food wasn't as good.

The first time I was absolutely shocked. I've been to so many French, American, etc. restaurants they started to blend together. When the waiter comes out and tells you the list of ingredients, you almost glaze over it because you don't really know half of them anyway. However, L'Atelier was different. They used ingredients I seriously could find in my own fridge, at my grocery store and in my pantry. Completely normal and ordinary ingredients but they made them extraordinary. They prepared dish after dish of amazing from plain things I had in my own house. This to me was the mark of an incredible chef because he truly transformed the ingredients and transcended their average qualities. 

The last time I went it was less so ... hence not 5-shiny stars. I still love this place though and may come back again when I'm in Vegas next time around.
