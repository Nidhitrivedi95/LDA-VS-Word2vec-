i5vxtyiHKYnRcJ0p9N7mLw I'm so impressed with this Deli! And the Yelpers who said you need to try the butternut squash ravioli were right. It's a whole new pasta-eating experience.

I've seen other restaurants at this location slowly fade away and close. Gourmet Deli seems to have a constant stream of regulars keeping them afloat, and I'm proud to be one of them. Their sandwiches, their pastas, and their tiramisu, all outstanding. A definite must!
