Zl6csaZ5HBka3SKBphHXrQ They clearly overbooked the restaurant for Winterlicious. 
I was forced to seat so tight that I got a muscle cramp. 
Eating here was like eating on a full bus: there are people sitting everywhere, and some are standing right next to you waiting for their chance to sit. 

Foodwise it was average, except creme brulee was clearly premade and just taken out of a fridge.
