vna49NPM-7B11tcFPTgnsg I dined here on my first night in Montreal. Being someone who loves Charceuterie & wine, I found it to be exactly what I wanted. Plus, I was pleasantly surprised by their offering of duck - I loved the duck ham & duck rillette. Also, top of the list for me was the beef cheek and burnt leek dish that comes with balsamic sauce & chimichurra sauce. The whole meal was very satisfying & I left feeling full with the two dishes & a couple glasses of wine. 
The service was great as well. It was a Monday night, so perhaps it's a less busy time of week.
