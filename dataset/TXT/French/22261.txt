BSmqxPbQglQwP2R56OqOag I've been here a couple times.  First time, I ordered sea bass.  It was okay, but not worth the price.  It was a bit oily as were the garnishes. 
Enjoyed the Spinach salad I had, the second time I went.  My kids love the burgers and the pizzas. Great kids menu.   
Service is inconsistent and there's somewhat of a snobby feeling in the air from the staff.  Not sure why...just feel it there when I walk in.  I think the greeters are just not friendly.
