mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q This is the best meal I've ever had. We both chose their 9-course seasonal tasting menu as well as basic wine pairing. The wagyu beef ribeye was out of this world and the mashed potatoes are easily the best thing I've ever eaten. Everything was perfect.

The service was good, and we really enjoyed sitting at the counter so we could see the kitchen.

While you can easily spend $1,000 like we did, it seems like you can also choose individual dishes and spend less which is probably what we'll do next time. 

I don't know if the food or the experience was more impressive!
