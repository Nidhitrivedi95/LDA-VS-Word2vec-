C3PVq7UpeHd6nz1_e-AtkA On a lovely thanksgiving morning, my fiancee and I were hankering for a delicious brunch experience. And so online I hopped looking for somewhere that would not disappoint as we are fairly picky in the food department.

Kalendar was introduced into our lives and I cannot say I was disappointed, in fact I was fairly impressed. Walking in, the staff was friendly, and the tables were small, but it added to the overall atmosphere. I ordered the eggs napolean and my husband-to-be had two meals (he's a big eater), omelet # 4 (the one with spicy sausage) and the stuffed french toast. The eggs napolean was super tasty, and filled me up nicely and both of his meals were delectable although I can't imagine only having the french toast (definetly not satisfying enough.... i need MEAT with breakfast!)

The biggest treat however, was their coffee. YUM! There is a cinnimoneyness to it (i know thats not a word) in aroma and taste. VERY impressed with that. Overall, delicious and will definetly be going back.
