t1mR_Zff6Dqv1TueE2JLEA Went for a birthday dinner with family - cool downtown location - nice decor - lighting "dim and dreary" rather than cozy - food was mediocre - 3 out of the 4 of us had tummy upset - overcooked - not a lot of fresh ingredients - deserts were disappointing - rice pudding was weird - ice cream was pasty
- belly dancer was very good - but kinda short - dancer moves around - mostly for photo ops - gets people up to dance
