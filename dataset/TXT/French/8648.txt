4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Perfect spot on the strip! We sat outdoors and had a great time people watching. The service was very good. But the food....oh yummm!!  Three of the four of us had the wonderful pancakes...We had lemon, cinnamon sugar and caramelized apple...comes with a side of fresh, incredible whipped cream. We all were certain we had ordered the best. We also had sides of their delicious bacon~ best I have ever had. Plus the bowl of cafe au lait and feeling like we were actually in Paris..all made for a wonderful experience. And I will seriously travel back to Las Vegas again, just to have those pancakes again!
