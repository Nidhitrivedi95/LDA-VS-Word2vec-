WOd8tWsh2Yt_osHv-ngx_w Overall standard Montreal breakfast fare, though delicious standard Montreal breakfast fare, served in a restaurant that straddles a diner atmosphere and a more upscale brunch establishment.  I ordered the eggs Benedict, whereas my girlfriend ordered the banana-strawberry-chocolate crêpe.    Savory hollandaise sauce, crispy English muffins, tasty ham, and good potatoes, as well as a (generous) bowl of fruit will greet (and satiate) the hungriest of breakfasters.   Now the crêpe clearly was modeled after the Leviathan, swimming in a sea of copious chocolate.  The dough of the crêpe itself straddles that of a Russian blintze and an American pancake, so there is definitely substance in there.  And one word of caution:  the banana-strawberry crêpe is served with a decent drizzling of chocolate, which is probably enough - order the banana-strawberry-chocolate crêpe only if you have a serious craving for chocolate.  As to the service, we were seated immediately, and though the establishment was (admitted by the waitress) understaffed, she smiled and mentioned that she would cover our table as well.  Overall, no delays, food arrived quickly - great breakfast experience.
