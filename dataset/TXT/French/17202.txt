9ETbjlbD52Q6PKXjIcTqUA The choices are limited in Anthem but the food here is pretty good. I had the chicken salad which was really good and i don't normally like chicken salad. The best by far is the kids Mac and cheese. Not Kraft m&c at all!! It was shells in an Alfredo type sauce   I probably ate all the leftovers. The only reason I give it 3 stars is that the menu is somewhat limited and though its supposed to be family friendly, it felt very weird to have a toddler there. But the staff was fairly friendly.
