0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g Simply awfully snotty service. Oh, but you do. It know what fine dining experience entails. No you troglodyte I know what class and service entails. When a restaurant works off volume and name then all is lost. Not asking my wife if she wants water is poor service plan and simple. Spend your money else where and do not be a sheep.
