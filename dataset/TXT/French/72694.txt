XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q The only 3 Michelin stars rated restaurant where I've had the pleasure of dining at twice! Joel Robuchon is the restaurant that created the foodie monster in me & Peter. We came here by accident. I know, that doesn't sound right. Peter thought he was making a reservation at Bouchon & being uneducated in the Michelin rated restaurants at the time...thought Joel Robuchon and Bouchon were the same lol!

A limo came to pick us up from our hotel. We were taken on the little stroll inside The Mansion (mind blown) and into the restaurant. We were stuck in awe of everything. The food was incredible, service was wonderful! At the end of the night, I thought it was only a dream to come back.

The second time around, we knew what we were up against. Armed with more culinary knowledge, we felt at ease while dining. Food wasn't as wonderful as we had remembered, but the first time was our first time having fine dining in general. Nevertheless, food was great and we left satisfied. Even snapped a pic with Chef Claude :)
