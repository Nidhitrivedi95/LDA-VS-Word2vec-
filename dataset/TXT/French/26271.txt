d4bVdEDwxmyB0M-w5vNNPg I had brunch here. They serve coffee in a French press. Fresh baked warm bread with butter and flaked salt accompanies your order. I got the Eggs Benedict with smoked salmon. It was pretty good. My only complaints is that the smoked salmon was too salty and the English muffin was too hard to cut through. It tasted good otherwise. It comes with a salad of only greens. The service is friendly, attentive and quick.
