8ciT6qjI18x9EPtOb-gqYQ I'm really glad I went during Yelp Eats! This place is expensive. Even after the significant discounts, I was out $50. I have to say I was a little underwhelmed; I had very high expectations. Still there are great items on the menu.

I'm not sure why, but I'm a little put off by the BYOB idea, yeah that's right...the $50 did not include drinks (my friends and I brought our own).
