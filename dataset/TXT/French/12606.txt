4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw My favorite place to eat lunch in Las Vegas.  Love to sit outside and watch the fountain show while eating their fantastic french onion soup and drinking some sangaria.  Their french onion soup is by far the best I have ever had.  All the meals I have ordered there are fantastic, last time I ordered an open faced BLT and it  was great!   I frequent Las Vegas once a year, and I always make sure to eat there at least once.
