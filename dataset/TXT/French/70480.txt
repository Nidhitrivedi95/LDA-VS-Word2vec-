xaqW4NkmUCGRRjmLxiFJ6Q This place is the very example of great tasting simple food created with the utmost care. In this day and age it's very rare to come across an establishment that take so much pride in what they do.

Nothing here is innovative and forward thinking (except maybe the food packaging). They have not invented anything new or created anything that we've never seen before. But as soon as the crepe shows up at your table you will see, smell and certainly taste the difference it makes when you have someone who is so passionate about what they do. Every little detail is not forgotten; from the wrapper on the outside all the way to ensuring the crepe has an even distribution of ingredients from the first bite to the last. Nothing is overlooked.

The crepes are simply delicious; with fresh vegetables, meats and cheese wrapped in a perfectly cooked, crispy batter. This is by far the best crepe I have ever had.

This place is a gem and I will definitely be back.
