4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw If you want find this restaurant easily in Vegas, you follow the Eiffel Tower, which seems to indicate where this restaurant is, like the church steeple stands for the church. Located in the Paris Las Vegas, the center of the Vegas Strip, where the beautiful Bellagio fountain performs every hour for this restaurant, people gawk and take pictures of the scene of people eating at the patio rather than other scenes, imagining one day they will come to visit to this restaurant whenever they have chances, I was also enticed to come to this restaurant to have brunch because the weather was perfect with the limpid sky, breeze out there, nice food to create the colorful blog my friend made. 

It was about 11am on weekdays, there's already crowded and had to wait 30mins but when I fawned it was the most beautiful restaurant in the world and I told them I am a regular customer, the staffs smiling on their faces and instantly led us the nicest table where we could be watching people and the Bellagio fountain show, heating overhead made me feel both cool breeze and heat bodies. The sky on which God created nice painting, the staffs serving nice food, my friends made me laughing out loud, my friend also laughing out loud as i told them i came to visit Las vegas whenever i needed fresh squeezed orange juice which i was shocked when i first visited and drank from my old country few decades ago.

We ordered the quiche, Eggs Benedict, Loraine and coffee and fresh squeezed orange juice which i already told them and they were convinced to accept to drink. How poor friends were, haha. Every food were really delicious and I, in particular, loved the quiche. it looked really plain but the taste was heavenly smooth and lots of cheese flavor and the right amount of arugula salad beside stole my heart.

Yes I truly became a regular customer.
