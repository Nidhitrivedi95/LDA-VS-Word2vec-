WOd8tWsh2Yt_osHv-ngx_w Went here on a Sunday day late morning and there was a line up but we only waited about 5mins  they had things moving quickly which was great. I ordered the French toast w bananas strawberries and  Nutella...it was great! 
My partner ordered eggs toast home fries and beans he also loved it ..over medium and cooked to perfection ..can't complain at all.
