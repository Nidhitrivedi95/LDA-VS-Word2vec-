vLkKorA1gPS97Zj0_WKA0Q Service was attentive, prompt, professional, friendly, educated on the components of each course, and caring. They warmly accommodated our requests. 

The 5 course tasting menu was delicious, the Wagu beef and white truffle Risotto really outstanding. 

Celebrity Chef Pierre Gagnaire was working in the restaurant and stopped by our table to say hello. 

Total bill was over $500 for two people, this included one wine pairing and two glasses of wine. 

The courses were beautiful (really enjoyed the presentation) and flavorful. 

Entry hallway decor was floral and colorful. 

The 3 hour dining experience was relaxing.
