Yp1swb-8pO8i-6-jaK2tsA We came here for the muffins and decided to stay for lunch. I can definitely say this place is one of the best for service. Our drinks were never empty. Our food was served quick and everything we ordered was great. The half roasted chicken was amazing. Good portion sizes even for the appetizers.
