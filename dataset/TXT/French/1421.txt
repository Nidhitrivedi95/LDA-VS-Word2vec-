_T7f2wUgNlJqxsR-cR89SQ What we loved:
-Valet service, helped us be on time for our reservation
-The service - our waiter seemed very knowledgeable and well read, and went out of his way to bring dishes in a certain order, refill our coffee 3 times, and recommend dishes that would complement each other. 
-The steak tartare first course was like nothing I've had before and was savoury and delicious.
-We ordered filet mignon and lamb for second courses, which were both tender, juicy and savoury. The filet mignon was one of the best steaks I've ever had!
-The coffee! It was Reunion Island coffee and went down very smoothly.
-The view - definitely ask for a seat by the window.
-The ambience was a good balance of casual and formal, and felt romantic with all the couples around us.

What we liked (not loved)
-The sashimi first course - the flavours, to me, masked the sashimi too much. But it was an interesting dish.
-The coconut cream pie and lemon mousse were good desserts but not sweet/rich enough for my sweet tooth!

Overall, this was one of my best restaurant experiences and I would definitely go back.
