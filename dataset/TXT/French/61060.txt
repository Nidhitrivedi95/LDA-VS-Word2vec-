SFnrHuVFSNiondFVUBLJZQ By reading some good reviews, my husband and i went the first time on december 29th, 2011. we were led to sit on the first floor at the right side of the entrance. during our meal, we were surprised that almost all other customers were led to the upper floors. it was at least -15 celsius degree outside. our table got all the cold air every time the entrance opened and closed. we rushed to finish our meal in half an hour as the temperature got unbearable.  i talked to the waitress about the problem and she said she could not do anything about it and asked me to talk to her boss. i asked her again when we checked out . this time she said she was sorry and she was the manager . she took our drinks out of our bill. overall, it was a disappointing meal. we felt that we had been used like a department store window display to attract more customers for them. we will not go there again.
