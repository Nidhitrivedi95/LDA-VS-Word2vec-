hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA I'm OBSESSED with this place. I've never had anything here I didn't like.  The blue brie sandwich may be the best sandwich to ever hit my mouth.  I dream about that sandwich.  The soups are always amazing, the bread is fresh, and the pastries are delish.  My only food complaint would be that I wish they had a fountain beverage bar, rather than individual bottled drinks.

Olivier is the best.  He is funny, entertaining, charming,  and really makes you feel welcome.  Service is excellent and friendly all around.

This place gets super busy at lunch so go early or late,  or you may not get a table.  The seating inside is limited,  but they do have a lot of outdoor seating if the weather is nice.   I wish they would open on weekends,  but I understand the reasoning.
