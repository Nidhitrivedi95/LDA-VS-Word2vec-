dubu2kN3Y9EB4uYGFWa0MQ This place is more of cocktail lounge than a restaurant. The old fashion I had was made right, but nothing special. I order fried vegetables for appetizer and that was pretty good. I ask the waiter for a recommendation chicken or sea bass, and that's where the 2 stars comes in. The sea bass was bland and in a green soup. The skin was still on too. The service was sub par. No one refilled our drinks and checked on us.
