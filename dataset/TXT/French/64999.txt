Tl2nqtPXlLbAG3qkUYVM2g Vincent's never disappoints.  I regularly dine at the Bistro and hit up the Farmers Market on Saturday's....but sometimes I just have to indulge in the original and go for the fancy.  For those dinners when you just have to have things shiny there just is not a real comparison in Phoenix.  The duck confit is amazing and if there is anything with foie gras involved just get it.  Always an excellent wine selection and good advice for non aficionados like me.  Vincents is an institution and a welcome consitency in Phoenix.
