4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I came to Vegas with 3 of my friends, and we tried a bunch of restaurants. Our first stop was this place for breakfast.

We ordered:
Chocolate bacon waffle
Croissant sandwich with turkey
cinnamon pancakes
banana muffin
pain de chocolate
spinach and green vegetable omelette

The cinnamon pancakes were the best out of everything we ordered. They looked more like an unfolded crepe. We all agreed to give this place 4 stars. Good service & good food!
