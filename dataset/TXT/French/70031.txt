WUq7NNgCTaPphTYL6qyEBQ I went to Mogette with my husband and parents for my 30th birthday. I wasn't lucky with my starter and main course, but the others were happier. I ordered a soup from the specials for a starter, which was not hot, and it was supposed to include a poached egg, which was completely hard. I returned it, and received another one after everyone else already finished their starters. The soup was hot this time, but it was blend and the egg was hard again. The others had onion soup which was nice and the calamari which was good. For main course I had the lamb. The owner promised it was a great dish and said "he'd pay for it if I didn't like it". It was served over-cooked and cold, and wasn't very hungry. I didn't return it because I didn't want to wait again but told him what I thought of the dish. Neither dish was taken off the bill. The others had the pot of fish and salmon, and liked them. We shared two deserts- creme brulee and apple tart, which were delicious. Overall, the food was mediocre (except for the deserts). The owner tried hard to give us good service, including singing for me a birthday song (a little embarrassing but nice of him) but he forgot the wine we ordered, and frankly, I'd prefer that he put more efforts towards making sure the dishes come out properly instead.
