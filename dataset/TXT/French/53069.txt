QeFsIMcIFIJcOrpthYL8jg It's in Old Montreal, aka tourist central, so it's overpriced but still rather tasty. Our waitress was extremely accommodating, especially considering it was a busy Sunday night and I'd brought two kids -- one on the picky side -- to an upscale restaurant. But she was fine with his simple choices, and even made recommendations to help us out.

For appetizers, my niece -- the foodie -- shared goat cheese filo dough creations topped with a sweet, nutty sauce that we both scarfed down. My pasta was fine -- nothing to write home about, just fine. Sames goes for the kids' meals, although there were certainly ample portions.

I wouldn't recommend Modavie for a resident, but I think we lucked out with our tourist-zone pick.
