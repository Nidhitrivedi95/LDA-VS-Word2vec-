xcmmTXhuMx2fZF2Bt69F4w Went here for the first time for a Sunday brunch with my boyfriend. We went around 2pm and there was a wait, but it was only about 5 minutes. We got lucky and were seated outside. It was a beautiful day, everyone in the neighborhood was so friendly. I ordered a mimosa and my boyfriend had a Belgium beer.  He ordered the mussels classic and loved them! I ordered a frittata that didn't have a lot of flavor, but it had avocado and a drizzle of a chipotle mayo and it was satisfying. Could've used more of a "pop" but it was still delicious. Maybe I'm just a lover of frittatas and realize the potential they could have...

Our server was very prompt and helpful, and my boyfriend and I had a great time together at Point Brugge. Would love to come back for an evening of mussels and wine! Definitely recommended for a couple, or a table for three.
