rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Since we were staying at the Venetian, the kids wanted to go to Bouchon for brunch...anticipating a long line, 3 of us headed out first.  We went down to the Casino level and walked through the Casino, past the front desk, into the hallway, then up the elevator and down another hall.  No one else was in line, however, they had to get the table ready, so there was a short wait.  Since the World Cup was being played, we didn't mind waiting and watched the TV in the waiting area.
Our table was ready just as the rest of the group arrived so we were seated... nice restaurant...The menu was quite extensive...lots of choices in oysters and lots of fancy offerings.  Fois gras pate, selection of oysters (for breakfast?), fresh fruit was shared by the group....I just split a corned beef and eggs with my son's girlfriend..I really enjoyed that!
My husband had the sour dough waffles, (I don't like sour dough so I didn't bother).  My daughter had the chicken and waffles...her waffles was good with bacon and chives...the chicken was roast chicken thigh and wing...
Service was good and at the end, the waiter offered us water and coffee to go...I thought that was really nice...and since I had a Kouig Amann waiting for me in the room, I accepted a cup of coffee....they don't serve Kouig Amann's int he restaurant, but he did find out how to pronounce it....sounds like "queen a mahn"....so now you have it!
