8_cTFNIWFiDqBQ8MyorQEA The owners had a small restaurant called La Famille up in Outremont and decided to close shop and open in Ville-Marie/Gay Village. This was a great decision on their part. The ambiance is laid-back and casual. The pastries are made fresh every morning and you get to see what they have to offer at their pastry counter right at the entrance.
We had brunch on the patio, it was a saturday morning at about 10am and the patio was half-full. By 11am the patio was full however the seating is arranged in a way to give you enough breathing space where you can have a good conversation without having to raise your voice. The staff was very welcoming, friendly and polite.The prices we're reflective of the ingredients they used. Since the menu changes every week, you can expect good, fresh, quality dining every time. I will be going back many more times in the future.
