qmh6zxtJ8C8-YiUPv7ySlw $48 hamburger... 

I must seem like an idiot...but this hamburger was THE ORIGINAL NY DB BURGER (9-oz. sirloin burger stuffed with braised short ribs, foie gras, black truffle, parmesan bun) served with french fries. I actually got the prix fixe menu for $48. It comes with a few choices, but I got the caesar salad (heart of romaine, avocado, parmesan), the burger and for dessert the warm pear clafoutis (spiced orange marmalade, almond ice cream). Although it was a nice meal, I don't know if I'd be dying to go back to eat the burger. It was really good for the first 2 or 3 bites but after that the foie gras and truffles were too overpowering. It was as if the foie gras and truffles were fighting for power in my mouth. 

The service was good. The water show on the lake was really weird with ugly images being displayed every hour. It's a fancy schmancy restaurant with good and expensive food. 

Here's their menu:
