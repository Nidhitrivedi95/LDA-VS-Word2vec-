6fPQJq4f_yiq1NHn0fd11Q From my first bite on my very first trip to the Paris Hotel, I have been a fan.  The crepes are yummy. Sweet ones, savory ones, they are all delicious.  They are pretty big too, I like to split one with someone.  

The service is not the best. This last time I was there, the woman taking my order hardly looked at me.  I could barely hear her, and since she wasn't looking at me, I couldn't tell if she was talking to me or the woman behind her making the crepe.  Whatever frustration I was feeling from the service, all went away when I took my crepe to a little table to enjoy (with my $4 bottle of water).  

The good part is since you order your crepe from the little window, you are only dealing with the mediocre service for just a few minutes.  Then, you are left to enjoy the mouth-watering crepe.  YUM!
