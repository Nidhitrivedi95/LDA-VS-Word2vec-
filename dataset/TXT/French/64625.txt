Tefx_N6A6nrsdj4jHHnbYg There were two coffee shops in the area, but this attracted my eye. Super cute & clean place! Had a Paris/18th century atmosphere. They also recently opened a month ago. The employees were very sweet. They approached us quickly and introduced the place and what they offered. I ordered the cold brew with vanilla almond milk, & it was perfect as is, didn't even have to add sweetener. Also tried the lavender shortbread cookies and raspberry macarons-- I personally thought the lavender cookies were amaze balls! I only am disappointed because I live too far away to come here more often. Definitely will be back if I'm in the area.
