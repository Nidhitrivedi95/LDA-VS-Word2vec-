tCSlpwJQ4CZsUEMZeH2SFg Went for brunch this past Sunday.  Food was good, but not anything special.  Service was just okay from the seating to the actual meal service, which was a bit slow.  I had the Benedict Monte, wife had the crabcake Benedict.  Again, nothing particularly wrong, just not so great.  I don't think we will be back for breakfast.  Terrace cafe is a better choice, pancake house maybe too depending on what you like.
