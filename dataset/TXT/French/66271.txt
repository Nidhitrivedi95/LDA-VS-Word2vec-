uP3H5bcsiTXM0k0xQhRndg Solid!!! I wish I had enough room for one or two more items... I had the calamari dish (seasonal) which was full of complex flavors. I really like that the meat and seafood entrees were done sous vide (which is a rare treat for an American). I also had the warm maple cake which tasted just like pancakes!
Sylvia was wonderful and very attentive.  She lets you taste wine so you know which one you really want.  She was so pleasant that we chatted for a while. 
The atmosphere was very nice. The restaurant is a bit small. I was able to get in for a Friday evening dinner.
