rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Rico was an amazing server. AND it was his birthday. And with what didn't even feel like a long wait, he got the head chef to comp us several appetizers and a lemon custard birthday tart for one of our friends. Perfection. The food was incredible (bone marrow was like butter and the raspberry sorbet was RIDICULOUS), and the service truly made for a memorable experience.
