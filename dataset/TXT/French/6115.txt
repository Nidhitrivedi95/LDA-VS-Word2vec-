3uC7Lbc3RgUDTWQlBu4PqQ While exploring and wandering around after dinner, we came across this little place! Mr. P was sweet enough to treat us all. I was more than pleased with my over-sized chocolate macaron!! I usually don't end up buying macarons because they're always so tiny! I take one bite, just begin to discover the flavor and it's gone. So these large macarons are just perfect!!
