O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q When it comes to lunch or brunch in the Palazzo your choices are somewhat limited. After two awful experiences at Grand Lux we wanted to try something different and Morels did not disappoint. 

Unfortunately our brunch did not start off on the right foot. We were made to wait for our table to be seat up which was odd, considering the restaurant was empty and it appeared that all of the tables were already set up. Upon seating us the hostess gave a little big of an attitude when we commented that it took a little long to set up tables in what appeared to be an empty and ready restaurant. 

Other than the 'tude from the hostess everything else was fantastic. It's a shame too because I would have probably given them 5 stars if not for her. Our server was great, very attentive, very nice. My mimosa was perfectly made and they also offer a Bloody Mary bar. 

My eggs benedict were fantastic, as were the order of pommes frites that I ordered as a side. (How do you go to a French restaurant and not try the pommes frites?) My husband loved his Croque Monsieur. The rest of my dining companions enjoyed their brunch as well. The stuffed French toast was tempting and I would definitely order it on a return trip. Brunch entrees were priced on the more expensive side when compared to a place in your hometown, but they were on par with hotel pricing.
