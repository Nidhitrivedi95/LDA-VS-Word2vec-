Funny how the previous week we went to the Melting Pot for upscale fondue and here we are at a French-Swiss restaurant that was delicious and fun!

First Sunday of the month is a clean comedy routine and it was fabulous!  We enjoyed the traditional fondue and the  La Potence (the "hanging man").  The table side prep was cool and the meat was delicious.   We split both items between 2 people and enjoyed an affordable and entertaining meal!  Cool factor=5
