0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g Three and a half stars. This is supposed to be a two Michelin star restaurant, but it did not live up to it's honor. 

There were three prixe fixe menus to choose from starting at $113 and up. The amuse bouche was a nice shot of carrot soup and a pheasant fried roll. 

We ordered two different menus, so in all got a good sample of what this place is all about. 

The first course: butternut squash soup for the hubby and lobster salad for me. Both were great. We agreed the meal was off to a great start. The lobster salad ended up being the best dish by the way. 

The next course: big eye tuna and foie gras. 
The tuna tartare lacked flavor , needed some serious pizazz . Foie gras was prepared with a thin crisp wafer and some type of soy sauce with a spoonful of mash potatoes. It wasn't bad. 

Next was the entree: lamb chops and halibut-- big disappointments! 
Not what we expected. 
The flavors combined just didn't burst in your mouth-the way these meals are delicately prepared to do so. We weren't automatically digging in for a second bite . 

Already feeling deflated, we ended the night with lackluster desserts. 
Mine was the fried rice pudding -came with mangoes and tart mango sorbet. The other was a chocolate cake with chocolate ice cream. ' 

Nothing spectacular. The latter was better. 
As for as the ambiance goes-very elegant. We got a seat facing the Bellagio water show. 
Execution great, details that went into creating and making the food needs work. 
When you pay for the finest that means everything should be spot on,
