zqNgwQjj0_XAll-neGikIw This place is a hidden gem in Old Town!!! The owner and chef is French. And he makes everything from scratch!! Even the ice cream!! Literally everything on the menu is always cooked just right with so much flavor. You can tell the owner takes pride in his work and his food. He always comes out to greet me and say thank you for coming in too! 

Try the Croque Madame, the French Onion soup, and the macarons! There's also sometimes a special on the special board with chicken and a mushroom sauce that is to die for. :) But my ultimate fave is the Tripe Chocolate pudding dessert. 

I love supporting local places and this place is one of my faves to support because of how great the owner and the food are!!
