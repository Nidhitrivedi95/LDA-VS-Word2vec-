SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ I had the pleasure of dining at House of Tricks yesterday with a couple of friends.  I live in Glendale, but it was definitely worth the drive.  House of Tricks has a regular lunch menu, and on Saturdays, they offer a brunch menu.  Each of us ordered something different, and we all enjoyed what we had.  One lady had the eggs benedict, another the shrimp and grits and I had grilled salmon salad, which was absolutely the best salmon salad I have ever had.  Even though I live in Glendale, I would definitely drive back to House of Tricks for the salmon salad.  

Yesterday's weather was perfect for outdoor dining.  We enjoyed the relaxed, comfortable atmosphere.  

The only negative is parking.  There is limited parking on the street, but across the street is a big sign "Public Parking".  Do not park there!  The entrance was completely open with no mention of having to pay for parking.  You can imagine our surprise when we went to our car and saw a traffic ticket on the windshield.  We walked around the parking lot to see where we might have missed a sign indicating we have to pay for parking, and we found something clear on the other side of the parking lot, definitely not in sight of where we drove in.
