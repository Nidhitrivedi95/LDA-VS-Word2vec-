eJ9L40jm5VOXCIq7xs9kQw This restaurant was recommended by the concierge at my hotel.

Had the 30.95 prie fixe menu and I must say this is the best deal in town for what you get.

This was a 3 coarse meal, included coffee.

And then I added wine by the glass.

The food was amazing.  For the appetizer I had the rabbit tarte, entree was the trout, and dessert was the chocolate moose.

The sauces were amazing.

I will be back to try one of the larger prie fixe menus.
