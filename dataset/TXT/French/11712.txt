4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I didn't realize that it is a French STEAKhouse (pretty much), so I was a little bummed because we had reservations at Craftsteak two days later. I got over it pretty quickly because it was delicious!  You can't have too much steak on vacation...I always say. 

This restaurant has a gluten free menu. Everything was simple and delicious. I would definitely go back because of the food and the gluten free menu and knowledgeable staff. 

The only issue was that there were too many people jammed into the space. It is in the Paris right on the street across from the Bellagio fountains so it is popular, but at some point restaurants need to just say NO. The place was brimming with people. We were there 10 minutes before our reservation and we still had to wait at the bar for about 1/2 an hour. We were seated in a kind of crappy spot...between the bar and the kitchen.  Then I realized that most of the seats were crappy unless you were outside. Next time we go here, I am going to ask specifically for an outdoor seat or a booth. We had made our reservations a month in advance.
