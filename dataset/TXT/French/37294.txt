iwFoA98-OgcdXmNS0LxNOA I have been here several times and enjoyed everything including food and service.  This occasion I came with my family to celebrate my son's birthday thinking we were in for a guaranteed great night.  But it didn't happen. 

 First of all we were seated and told our waitresses name and that she would be right there.   We waited 15 min without anyone stopping at our table before I got up and went to the hostess to find out what was happening as we hadn't seen anyone nor even received menus.   She promptly moved us to another area of the restaurant and told who our new waitress would be.  After waiting a few more minutes we saw our waitress and we ordered our appetizer, food and drinks.  We got our drinks right away but not the appetizers .   Finally after a good 20 minutes the waitress came over and said the appetizer wouldn't be ready for another 10 min but our meals were ready.  In saying that she asked if we still wanted the appetizer to which I replied no.   After serving our meals I asked how that happened and she admitted that she forgot to enter it.   It was just the icing on the cake.   Here I brought the family bragging about the food and the service only to have the worst service I have ever had anywhere.   I believe with the mistakes that obviously the staff were well aware of warranted a visit from the manager on duty to at least apologize but that didn't happen. 

As for the food it was once again very good but I must say the portion sizes have become much smaller since I first started going here when it opened.  We all left feeling unsatisfied as I ended up sharing my meal with my hungry boys.   It's too bad you took a great place with a great menu and destroyed it with bad staff.  

Overall I was less than impressed this visit and I am in no hurry to go back.
