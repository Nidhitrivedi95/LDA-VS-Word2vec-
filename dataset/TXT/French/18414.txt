A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g The 4 stars definitely go to the Meringues, Tart Tropizienne, and Macarons.

The service or lack of  seems to be my lasting impression.  The lady behind the counter (older blonde didn't get her name) was very impatient with our order and secondly, I would think that if I am paying for a pastry I should be able to chose which one I want to buy but "OH Nooo" was her response to that "I cant do that the owners are watching on camera and they will get mad" what...really??? Even if that were true you wouldn't want to portrait your boss that way I would think and second I am paying for it...what are they going to get mad about? Bad day or underpaid she has issues?

We sat down after receiving our pastries and continued to observe her mannerism  with other customers.  Every time she thought no one was looking she was rolling her eyes and mumbling under her breath.  Wow it's amazing that such a sweet concept can leave such a bitter taste.  What I really hope the owners catch on camera is her much to be desired customer service
