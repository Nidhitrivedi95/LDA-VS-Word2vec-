cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg Unless you are an absolute fanatic of foie gras, or a gluttonous meat and potato eater, skip this place. We came out of the restaurant feeling exhausted, and disappointed, from voluminous salty dishes and an expensive check (even though we ordered two of the modestly-priced bottles of wines on the list). Service could best be described as glacial as it took almost an hour for our main dishes to arrive. The restaurant is not big, so be ready for elbow-to-elbow seating. It's one of the famed Montreal restaurants and a very popular destination for foodies and tourists. We're New Yorkers, and former residents of Tokyo, who love trying food from street carts to Michelin-starred restaurants. That said, Au Pied de Cochon was nothing to write home about.
