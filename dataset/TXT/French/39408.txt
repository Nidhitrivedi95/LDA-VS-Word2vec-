jSfnItqaOnEp2nenVF7fCg Enjoyed a delicious lunch with friends. The freshly made hummus and pita is an ample start to share.  The Quiche was by far the best I have had and the tomato bisque soup was outstanding.  Service was extraordinary.  This restaurant is small in size but big on flavor and service.  Definitely on my list for a return visit.
