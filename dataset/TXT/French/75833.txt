Ykxnrs6TkoWQPsStMwPseQ Great BYOB restaurant and delicious food, what a great combination! The service was impeccable and that kind of added a lot to the score. Their fois gras was just like I like it, almost melting in your mouth. Their tartare was bit different from what I like, but I was still pleasantly surprised with presentation. The decor of the restaraunt is another strong point to consider. 
It's perfect for a nice dinner with friends, bringing your date or even a dinner with parents. Definitely a good place to try!
