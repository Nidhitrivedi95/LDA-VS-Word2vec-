htQgj-ANQpZGpIpkkrEmyQ I've had the opportunity to come here twice thus far. I came got brunch and dinner. 
The place is quite small to expect to wait during busy hours, unless you make a reservation. Staff were all very friendly and had a good knowledge of the food. One waitress was even able to provide input on a drink to customize to the customer's tastes - well done. 
We started with the pulled pork fries. Delicious. If they ask if you want pepper, say yes. I'm not a huge black pepper fan but it enhanced this dish. I can't say I've had this type of fry experience before meaning, it was delicious and unique and I would order it every time as an app.
I then went for the infamous chicken and waffle. The first several bites were delicious! So many flavours to enhance your plain old fried chicken and waffle. And it was HUGE. is recommended sharing it as it was quite heavy. The only downside to it was the fact that the waffles got really soggy from the sauce and flat, ie. No more fluffiness.. I'd suggest perhaps subbing the syrup/sauce in a container on the side and have the customer drizzle it on themselves to avoid this one minor issue. 
Dessert! We ordered both their desserts to share because they sounded so freaking good on the menu. First was the matcha cheesecake. We were VERY disappointed. But we did appreciate the effort and the labour put into it. It's basically like an uncle tetsu cake but 4 times smaller. It was the size of a cupcake for $12! And the matcha flavour was very subtle. There wasn't anything special about it other than it was served in a dim sum container. Luckily we ordered the other dessert which blew us off our seats. SO delicious and a must order!!! This was also $12 but it was 7 times bigger than the cheesecake. And so many flavours! It has banana bread waffles with delicious ice cream topped with capt n crunch. Yum yum yum. 
Overall, I enjoy coming here and would return.
