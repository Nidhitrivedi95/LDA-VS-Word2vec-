xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g I came here with my girlfriend we knew up front that this was going to be expensive but we put it in the back of our minds and enjoyed it for it was. The place is an awesome restaurant the views are spectacular and the vibe is very romantic. The food was delicious. I ordered the beef Wellington which I've never had before it was really good. My girl ordered the steak and said it was the best steak shes ever had which means alot because we've had some really good steak in Chicago. The breads they came passing around were really good too. Bill was around $250 with tip which was pretty good cause we also tried like 3 sides. Afterwards we took the elevator to the top of the Eiffel tower which ended up being a catastrophe cause my girl is terrified of heights which I didnt know lol. She ended up gripping the wall for dear life she literally had tears in her eyes so we didnt stay long. Overall very nice memory though.
