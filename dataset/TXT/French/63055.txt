you can either perceive the food as this: 1) falling short of expectations, or 2) overpriced for what you get.  i ordered one of their specials, sea bass over a "stew" of vegetables. the fish was overcooked and quite tough and the combination of vegetables was odd and did not work together to make the dish that great - peas, onions, bok CHOY(why?) in this watery soupy-like broth. was that the "stew" part? it was strange to me, but tasted okay, but it could probably be better than that!

my visiting parents ordered duck confit (that looked better) and salmon with lentils. the latter was overcooked as well and the lentils didn't really go too well with it. maybe fish isn't their forte. this place doesn't use gallons of salt like sergio's, but i think they could probably come up with a better way of making their dishes flavorful. not the most satisfying dinner...

oh and BTW, also commenting on parking: it is SO silly to charge patrons to park in their giant, empty parking lot when you can park on the street for free! i pulled up to the parking attendant, found out i had to pay, and back out and right into a space on the curb in front of him. good ol' university circle. i wonder what that made him think!

on the plus side, the cheesecake is unique and really good. cool space inside and attentive service.
