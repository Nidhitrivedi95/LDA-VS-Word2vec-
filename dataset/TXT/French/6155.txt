41vgh9z4OSJfbgOy57qh0Q We had breakfast here every morning whilst staying at the Waldorf Astoria and it was great! Only downer was our last morning when we couldn't get a table but had to sit in peacock alley. This meant we had to carry out food to a low table and found it harder to get the attention of staff for coffee etc.

We dined in the Galvin one night and having not booked a table, we were given one at the side of the bar.

Deciding on having the seafood platter and few extras my friend asked if some of it could be served warm and some cold, the manager said they could. It did take a while for food to arrive. Though I'm no expert on seafood, I tried to eat as much as I could and it was fine. I just think we needed a bigger table, look for my photo to see what I mean!! Ha ha

We had the soufflé for dessert and it was lovely!!!
