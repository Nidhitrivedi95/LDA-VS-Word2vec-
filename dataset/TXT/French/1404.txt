_T7f2wUgNlJqxsR-cR89SQ Known to be one of the best restaurants in Toronto, this was a very good spot for a business dinner. I could also see it as a good romantic dinner place too.  

Food was very good, but I feel I am spoiled in San Francisco with fine dining, especially if this is one of the best Toronto has to offer. 

Location was the most interesting part. From the outside, the building looks like a college dormitory. Once inside the door, a nicely contemporary restaurant reveals itself with a view of the city.
