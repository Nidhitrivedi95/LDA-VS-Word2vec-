P2g6xo5vZSEeGSr9tftLeg My wife and I had the foursome platter, it was just the right amount of food for two people. All the food was delicious and we really enjoyed it. The only negative thing to be said was the service wasn't the best, the waiters weren't the most attentive. 

I would still recommend the restaurant to anyone looking for something different.
