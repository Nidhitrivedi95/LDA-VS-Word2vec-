6fPQJq4f_yiq1NHn0fd11Q Mmmm giant, enormous, bundles of crepes! I'm sad because the price of one individual crepe sky rocketed to $9.99 each compared to back then, they were like $7.99 :( I know, not a big difference, but two dollars can change a life you know.. ANYWAYS I can't believe that this place is hidden inside none other than Paris. It's right across from that long ass line for the buffet, but why wait when you could conveniently get it to go right? There are some ups and downs to the crepes though. I haven't tried all of it, but if you like something that tastes like potpourri, then get "The Favorite" which is I think #1 on the menu. It's a combination of random fruits which over powers the crepe itself. I honestly don't like it :( If you want something as a dessert, I suggest you get either the Nutella, Chocolate or Suzette. I know for sure that those are yummy, but I have yet to try the others, so if you want to be adventurous and try something else, then hell, go for it! :) My last comment for the evening is.. the Fruits De Mer, also shortly and casually known as "Seafood Crepe" -___-. It's awesome for seafood lovers though! It has scallops, mushrooms, shrimp, and mozarella. Doesn't sound good but it is! Nom nom nom
