YUFxSG6idHePsxOmnSHtpQ This was my first time to this Mimis. My only regret was that it took me so long to go. I had heard from a coworker about their delicious breakfast, which I have still not tried, but my wife and I went for dinner. The service was exceptional, especially the manager, Jim. Our server was also very attentive and between our server, the manager, and our food our visit was exceptional. I ordered the garlic brick chicken and it was delicious. The only part of it I did not like was the chicken was still on the bone. It was a half chicken served with cheesy potatoes au gratin and a side salad. The portions were just the right size. I also ordered a cup of their French onion soup and highly recommend it. The bread basket was also delicious. I look forward to my next visit.
