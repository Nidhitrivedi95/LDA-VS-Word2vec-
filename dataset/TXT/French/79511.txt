ZQ49AFC15QBPaoS7p4NTUg Went there for breakfast on a Sunday morning. Had the brioche l'enchanteur which tasted great. The mascarpone in it was great and i liked thar there was a lit of fruits with it.  Just be warned that it is a bit sweet. But since I was not feeling like egss and bacon this morning it hit the spot perfectly. One of the person I was with had the crepe vege and it looked good. The third person of our group had eggs with sausage. The sausage looked good but I had a taste of the potatoes and they were ok. Tasted a but greasy. The nicest part of this place is the terrace. Even if it's on the street it's not bad because the street is not too busy.

Price wise for 3 people it came up around 40$ with the taxes which is not bad.
