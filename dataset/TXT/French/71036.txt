xcmmTXhuMx2fZF2Bt69F4w This has always been one of my very favorite places in Pittsburgh.   I regret to say that we were mildly disappointed on Saturday evening (11/12).  The fine beer was wonderful as usual.  We ordered the moules and frites as we always do, but this time the mussels were not as fine as our previous visits.  Many of the shells didn't open and they were not as free from grit as their previous standards called for.  The food has been so good, that we have to return, but this was a cut below their past performance.
