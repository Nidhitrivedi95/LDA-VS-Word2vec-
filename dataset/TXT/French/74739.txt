xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g I took my wife here for her birthday a few months back, and it was well worth the high price. The recall food was amazing (I ordered the duck) and they even gave us the best view so we could see all of Vegas!! Our server was supremely courteous and professional. They forgot that it was my wife's birthday, but it was okay because we had the greatest time.

Thank you very much!
