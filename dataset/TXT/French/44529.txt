The place is quite pretty and the menu might be appealing to out-of-towners that don't know about all the other great classic French bistro-style restaurants in Montreal, but if you've been to L'Express, Le Meac or even Cafe Cherrier, this place doesn't even compare.

The food here was good a few years ago, but I'd have to say that it's mediocre at best now. I had dinner here this weekend and parmentier soup was bland, the steak in the steak-frites was dry and overcooked, and the cod fish was fine but nothing to write home about. And last but not least, the baba-au-rhum dessert was watery.

Although the food was a let down, our waiter was friendly and on point, and there is still something kind of nice and nostalgic about the place itself. It's the kind of spot you wish could stay good forever. But sadly, it seems pretty obvious that it's not the case. 

There are tons of French bistro-style spots in Montreal that are WAY better. I'd pass on this one if I were you. 

Sorry!
