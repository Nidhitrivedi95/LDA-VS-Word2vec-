rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Do yourself a favor, eat here and order the chicken and waffles! You seriously won't regret it. Came here for brunch. My husband and I ordered the pastry assortment. Each item was delicious. we wound up taking most of them home and having them for breakfast the next morning. The beignet, chocolate almond croissant and sticky bun were all amazing but the star of the show was the chicken and waffles.

Every single thing on the plate was absolutely delicious on its own: the bacon chive waffle, the skin on the chicken, the juicy chicken meat itself and the sauce. Then you pair them all together. Oh. My. God. Top ten best things I've ever eaten!
