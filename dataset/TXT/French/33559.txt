hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA I was talking with a friend who was just back from France. He told me how nice Paris was, everybody were nicely dressed and how good french food was. I was so excited that I decided to find a French restaurant and try real French food. Went on Yelp (of course) and found Baguette Cafe. Came here for brunch the following morning. The owner Olivier greeted me and started to talking to me. I have never met this kind of a welcoming person filled with energy and shining eyes. He introduced me to his workers which I found out later were his family members. And I felt like we knew each other for a long time. That was amazing.
He gave me some advice on what to try, and, finally I decided to go with chipotle sandwich with salad, berry torte and some iced tea. My order came fast enough. Everything was very delicious. I'm happy that I was here and definitely this place will be one of my favorite places.
When I was going to leave them Olivier shook my hand and thanked me for visiting them. I was so happy with this kind of service. Many business owners must learn a lot from him. 
The only bad thing was that they are far away from center and it is a little hard to find them.
I'll be back for sure to try their other dishes, especially from their vegan menu.
