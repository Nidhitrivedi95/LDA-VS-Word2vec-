Yp9w4nhUowBU_IS_StFXbQ One of my all-time favorite breakfast & brunch spots anywhere. It's become a Vegas tradition to grab brunch at Tableau on Sunday morning before leaving town -- brunch here is perhaps what I look forward to most, and is one of the few mandatory stops on the Vegas itinerary. 

What particularly stands out is the exemplary service -- the careful attention to detail throughout Wynn's properties finds no exception here. The staff addresses you by name and has a uncanny knack for making you feel as if you're their sole customer.

We order the Tableau Breakfast, which includes the pastry basket -- an assortment of freshly-baked pastries and jams that rival (or surpass) those found at any fine-dining establishment. The meal is filling and delicious and leaves nothing left to be desired. Coffee served is from Intelligentsia (perhaps the best coffee-roaster in LA). 

The atmosphere is unique in that you feel just as comfortable in boat shoes and a polo than in swim-trunks and a t-shirt. The tables are white-linen clad, and the space is beautiful and airy, with large windows that face the VIP pool to the east. The walk to the bathroom, through the marble-clad, tower suites lobby, takes you past several, rotating pieces of art from Mr. Wynn's private collection. I spotted a Picasso (authentic) just outside the men's room door. In fact the dining room's decor always reminded me of Picacco's, post 30's, expressionist works  -- not a coincidence, I'm starting to believe. 

Tableau (and The Wynn) is a respite from a town that can otherwise be tacky, over-priced and sub-par. I greatly enjoy spending time here and look forward to visiting for years to come.
