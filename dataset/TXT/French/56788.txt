rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A This is maybe my 7th time eating here. I took a group there last night and it was superb! We had Kumomoto oysters to start as well as shrimp. The raw bar is impressive to look at and eating from it, even better.  One guest had the Laitue salad, a mix of bibb lettuces and fine herbs and the house vinaigrette. She is very picky and usually likes iceberg and ranch - she ate every bite!
For main courses we all shared. Steak Frites, Salmon and Lentils and Crispy Skinned Striped Bass with Gnocchi, Forested Mushrooms and Black Truffle Mousseline.  Divine. Everything was cooked to perfection and every guest was happy and impressed. Our server Amy D was very knowledgeable, very gracious and the perfect server. Not to "waity" and she was right there when we needed her (all the while maintaining her section).  Our desserts ranged from Profiteroles, Lemon Tart, Chocolate Bouchons w/ Strawberry, Orange and Mint Ice Cream + Some kind of Hazelnut Gateau with housemade hazelnut ice cream. They also had hazelnuts and fresh honey on the side. Amy sent an additional dessert, Housemade Tarte Tatin w/ vanilla ice cream. I was in heaven and then some. 
The wine list is very extensive and since my guests are used to paying $16+ for a glass of wine, I chose simple, Macon, Mehlville Pinot and for myself a splurge of Billecart Brut Salmon bubbles. 
We had a blast!
