xNnZ5ksBY1gwwTV2Btb4Ag Great place for brunch! Stumbled upon this place grabbing macaroons down the street and this place was recommended by the girl who worked there. Thank you to her because it was a great meal :) 

Charcuterie plate to start was made in-house and was large (only 2 of us) and amazing! They even vacuum sealed up our left overs since we had already ordered our mains. Really appreciated that since we had a long drive back to Toronto. Followed that up with the bone-marrow pulled pork with toast and claimed it was one of the best brunch items he has ever eaten. I had the cheddar waffles topped with the same pulled pork. DELISH. I was told this was one of the most popular items and it did not disappoint. I would say both were very rich and could easily be shared if starting with something else. Cute, casual spot with some great drink offerings as well. If you are in this area, make a stop and you won't be disappointed!
