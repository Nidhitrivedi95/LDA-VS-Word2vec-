T4shscbr3BU3yb6EA3BSfA I've been here twice with my girlfriend, and both times were amazing. This is as good as dining out gets in Montreal.

First time was about a year and a half ago, so I don't remember a lot of detail. We both had the 5-course tasting menu, which is what it sounds like: 5 small courses, chosen by the chef, delivered in a steady trickle over a couple of hours. Everything was impeccable and delicious. My girlfriend splurged and got the accompanying wines: again, small servings chosen by the chef to go with the food. I'm not a wine drinker, but she raves about it to this day.

We went again last week. Started by sharing the liver mousse appetizer, which was a plateful of itsy-bitsy little gems, like liver mousse (of course), cubes of gin jelly, slices of parsnip, and blueberry sauce. Absolutely amazing. For mains, I had rabbit and she had suckling pork, both were delicious. Again, both plates featured several ingredients, carefully chosen and beautifully presented and, most importantly, delicious. Likewise with dessert.

Les 400 Coups is really the textbook fancy French restaurant: impeccable service, beautiful presentation, small servings, high prices, and absolutely tons of flavour. Not somewhere you'd go every week unless you're made of money, but worth the occasional splurge.
