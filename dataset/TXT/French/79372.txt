zIyqiWYKrCvAdGeWXXBxFw This review is from July. We went to celebrate a special occasion and it became a disaster and ruined our big day. Wrote to the restaurant and never got an apology back. Here's a summary:

We were seated indoors, and the number of mosquitoes inside the restaurant was ridiculous. We were very, very uncomfortable and itchy throughout, so much so that my husband kept saying we should get the food to go and it wasn't worth sitting there. This despite the food which was good (except the molten lava cake which was a fully solid cake with no molten lava in it). The whole meal was not only ruined by the atmosphere, but we were very, very uncomfortable. By the time we got home, we had terrible mosquito bites all over. This is really unacceptable for a good restaurant, and frankly it wouldn't even be acceptable for a cheaper food place. On top of that, we were seated next to the kitchen area, and could constantly hear staff yelling at each other. No apology, and half our food went uneaten due to the mosquito-related discomfort.
 
Very unfortunate since we were hoping this could be our go-to restaurant for dinner not far from our place.
