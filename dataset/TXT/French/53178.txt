QeFsIMcIFIJcOrpthYL8jg Our hotel in Montreal suggested we try Modavie, so at first we were resistant, thinking it might be a touristy place.  In the Old Port, Modavie is a breath of fresh air amidst much more touristy menus (although the weird digital menu boxes outside restaurants leave this US native feeling like she's contemplating a night at Chili's -- get rid of those, Montreal!).

The live jazz music inside drew us in, and we were immediately given a lovely table for two in the window where we could watch others' faces glow as they stared at the digital menu box.

Having had a late lunch, we shared a salmon carpaccio appetizer and endive salad with apples and roquefort.  The salmon was extremely fresh and the garnishes were fresh and arranged with great technical precision.  A squeeze of lemon brought out the freshness of everything on the plate.  The endive salad was also rife with bitterness from fresh endives, with a not-too-heavy dressing, and balanced by the blue cheese.

A solid way to start an evening in Montreal with small plates and seasonal offerings.
