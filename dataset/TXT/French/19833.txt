aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw The only reason this place got 2 stars instead of 1 is because of the great raw clams and oysters. Unfortunately they weren't even served with a mignonette. What kind of place serves a raw bar with cocktail sauce? Geez!
The shrimp and grits were yucky. The beignets were heavy and hard and crusty. Not light and fluffy at all. 
Definitely will not be going to any other Bouchons.
