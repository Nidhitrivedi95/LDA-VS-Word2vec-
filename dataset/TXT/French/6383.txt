4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw A 3 for the food and I can definitely see the extra star for the environment. Great patio and even though it is outside they still manage to blast the AC hard enough to keep it from being unbearably hot during summer. 

The burger that I had was better than everyone's breakfast items. Simple. Cheddar cheese, lettuce, onion, tomato. Fries were crispy, cold, string type guys. Pass. Wife's poached eggs and sausage was average. Hash browns were bad - chewy and room temperature. Good toast.

Reasonably priced. $14 for the burger and $14 for the eggs.

Glad we went I guess but doubtful I'll be back.
