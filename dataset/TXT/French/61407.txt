SJo_IjvzdRtCvZVN0cbrRQ So my sidekick of the other gender included this as a stop in a little weekend chill-away. Had brunch, my selection was the Croque Monsieur with egg. Can u say bite-your-fingers? Gorgeous flaky buttery fresh perfect croissant, fresh local organic innards, nice size, and fresh local fruit side. She had the breakfast hash, also "delishiuis" I stole as much as I could transport across the table. If this place of food-goodness wasn't an hour away I'd be here every morning.
