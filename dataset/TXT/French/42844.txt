The details: Had dinner and brunch at Sel gras. Bartender had an unnamed whiskey cocktail of the day, and she walked over the talked us through it (it was splendid, by the way). We skipped the appetizers and had the elk and the red snapper--both just superb. We didn't have dessert, but the options looked great.

Brunch: We ordered the frittata, croque monsieur, caesar salad with fried egg, and sausage salad (if you're not French, look this up--it is NOT a green salad with sausage!). Fries were hot, crispy, and fresh. Side salads had beautiful greens. No alcohol that day for us; we drank coffee and café au lait, which was more like milk with a little bit of coffee. So if you're more of a coffee than milk lover, just stick with regular java or have them add an extra shot of espresso.
