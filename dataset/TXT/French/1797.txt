0JGMKaKJGVuDus5WcJzvjw We lucked out big time when our concierge scored us a reservation here.

We were seated on an outdoor covered patio in the back of the restaurant. I love the vibe inside, but especially love the patio as it is quieter and quite atmospheric in a laid back sort of way.

Our server was very nice and helpful.

For appetizers we ordered rabbit pasta with fettuccine and pea sauce. It was so good I would give it 10 stars. It is not always on the menu, but if it is when you go, I recommend a large order of it as your main. We ordered Lobster Pasta (they're known for it) and a steak. Both were delicious. The lobster pasta is a large order and very rich. I recommend the smaller size, as I couldn't finish it and I almost always finish everything. The lobster was sweet and delicious and the creamy red sauce was perfection. My husband's steak was good, but not as good as the other things. Our desserts were fabulous. I had the profiteroles and he had a brioche with creme fresh ice cream. He raved about it. 

I recommend you make a reservation as soon as you book your flight!
