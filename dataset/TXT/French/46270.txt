n_bJq-tCY0TZVhNJBuLHMg The sinclair restaurant is in the St Sulpice hotel at the Vieux montreal.
It is one of those restaurants where you can go several times for brunch or lunch and never get bored. Also, it s a perfect place to organise events.
 
The decor is modern and neat. The tables are all white. The chairs are nice and comfortable. 
I do recommend the terrace when it is sunny. The greenery makes you forget that you in the heart of downtown. It is usually open during summer. 

The service is impeccable, professional and fast. I have nothing to add here.
We had grilled salmon , duck sandwich, and a burger. The presentation is very nice. The food is served on big blue plates. 
For desert, we had the chocolate mousse. 

Their orange juice is freshly squeezed. The coffee was good and their mini croissant are from Premiere Moisson. 

Overall, that place puts you in a very good mood. You will also spend a great time there.
