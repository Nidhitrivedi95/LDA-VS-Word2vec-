La Garde-Manger is simply put...GREAT.  Teeny tiny out of the way place with a handful of table and a go-go-go attitude and feel without being rushed. The place is can be very dark and almost a little too much so. The person I dined with wasn't able to read the wine menu from their seat due to low levels of light.  The place could spare a few extra luxes from the gigantic chandelier that dominates the ceiling.

A word about that wine list...it's good, it's long, it's varied. What it is not, is cheap.  Since I'm not in the restaurant business I will never fully understand why wine I can buy at the store triples or quadruples in price when I buy it at the table.  That being said you can still find something that is "reasonable" (ish) and will work well with whatever they have to offer that night. If you need help the staff is as knowledgeable about the wine list as they are about the menu.

The menu is ever evolving thing I won't go into the details as to what tried. Suffice it to say that what I ate was incredible well prepared, flavourful, perfect temperature, appropriately spiced and left a great mouth feel/texture. At La Garde-Manger the menu is on the wall (also something hard to read at times cause of the light and people's heads being in the way) and its shows what's fresh today.  A good mixed of sea food and other delectable choices there is something there for everyone.

A quick final word about the sound of the place.  From entry to exit we heard a upbeat mix of everything from Pink Floyd to Brittany Spears.  Fun!
