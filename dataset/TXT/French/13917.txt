You can't go wrong with a buck a shuck after 5pm!  An amazing deal and they're simple and tasty!  

Chef Amanda Ray always prepares her menu with thought and love.  I'm always torn when I have to order my meal at Biffs.  But now that I have moved out West, I have to be even more picky!  

I headed to Biffs for a special occasion - my birthday!  A group of 8 of us had a reservation and were seated promptly as we arrived.  Our server graced us with the evening's specials and we decided to order from the regular menu.  We had a selection of starters from salads to pig's ears!  

Our mains ranged from the duck to the beef bourginon.  EVERYONE was pleased with their choices and the flavours were amazing as always.

A nice birthday treat ended the meal along with a couple of baskets of the warm madeleines.  Always me favourite!

Oh Biffs!  I miss you ... and will be back!
