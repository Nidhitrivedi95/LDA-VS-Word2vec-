My boyfriend and I had dinner here after opting out of reservations across the street at Lameac, which had been recommended to us by our hotel's concierge, but which was far too loud and and busy for our tastes (I expect summer is better with the patio access -- in winter, the main room is oppressively loud.)

Everything about Chez Leveque was just perfect: our waiter was fantastic, the food was delicious, and the overall atmosphere was warm and inviting, especially after a long, cold walk from the metro. 

As for the meal? Divine. My boyfriend had the French onion soup as a starter, and of course I had to try it. Amazing. For a main, he had filet mignon, which was perfect. I had the bouillabaisse, which was absolutely incredible, and full of salmon, red snapper, clams, and mussels (and one slightly over-cooked shrimp.) The soup came with a side of toasted bread, cheese, and a sauce, which you were supposed to submerge in the soup, but I thought that was over-kill for what was a superb soup.)

Neither of us had dessert, but the selection looked delicious.

Two tips: 
1. If you go, and if you're on a budget, note that they do a $21 fixed price menu after 9:00. Before 9:00, the place is full of considerably older folks (as noted by another reviewer), but after 9:00, younger couples came in to dine. 

2. This place has one of the more amusingly themed washrooms I've seen. The restaurant has a slightly religious motif going on (not sure why), and the washrooms are worth checking out.
