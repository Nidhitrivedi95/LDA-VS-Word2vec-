They specialize in savoury and dessert crepes. I was told any crepe can be customized but I decided to try one of their specialty savoury combinations, the philly cheese.  The crepe was deliciously crisp and filled with roast beef, cheddar cheese, green peppers, arugula, onions and BBQ sauce.  It was wrapped in a cleverly designed sleeve where you tear it apart as you eat to expose the crepe.  Not only yummy but this crepe was huge and makes a satisfying meal. 

I washed it down with their sugar cane drink. It was freshly squeezed to order.  Not overly sweet like pop, just perfect and very refreshing. 

I will definitely come again and try one of their dessert crepes to satisfy my sweet tooth or another savoury crepe. 

Tip:  This place is not visible from the street. It's located in a outdoor courtyard surrounded by many other eateries and shops.  You can park for free in the courtyard or underground.
