mRrgBIT8vsYdI3YSfzCQhg Modern cozy restaurant of smart casual dinning. My experience this evening was wonderful. The restaurant wasn't too busy which made table chat a breeze. The server was gracious, knowledgable, and kind. The food was so authentic and full or flavor. It made me feel that the food I have come accustomed to eating at restaurants is of a much lower quality in comparison to this delicious wake up call. The prices with that said are in line with the quality of the food. Our table average per head was $40 which included desert, drink, tax, and a nice tip. Go visit it sometime and don't be intimidated by the "fancy" dress code Yelp says it has, the establishment still has that warm, locally run feeling which is so welcoming. 

Yumm.
