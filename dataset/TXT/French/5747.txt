We also received complimentary apple liquor shots from our very kind waitress. My only qualm with this place is that there was a high pitched, mechanical hissing sound coming from the back of the restaurant throughout the entire dinner. Anyway, I didn't bring it up to my date because once you realize it exists, you can't stop focusing on it. If it had been a first date, I would have been slightly embarrassed that I brought him to such a noisy place.
