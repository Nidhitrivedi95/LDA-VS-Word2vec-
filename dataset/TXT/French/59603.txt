The unique combination of ingredients and flavours fill a desire true foodies crave. This is a real gem. I had the rabbit, which I couldn't believe how much I loved. I didn't even know I liked rabbit. It had the most amazing brazing that gave it a wonderful flavour and the meat was soooo juicy. The rabbit came with homemade potato chips that were both soft and crunchy-the best I''ve ever eaten. Just writing this is making me crave more! The restaurant is designed to perfection with lots of room to breath between tables. Bring your whole family or plan a romantic night. This does it all! I hear the weekend brunch is a real speciality! I can't wait to go back and introduce more friends. I know they will be thanking me for sharing this new restaurant with them!
