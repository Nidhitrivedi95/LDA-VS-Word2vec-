ovtlrcsVRlgZZQUlHs_ovw Charming place and atmosphere. I had meatloaf which was recommended. Really good, however, the sauce put on it was a bit too sweet. My wife had the 6 oz. filet (more like 4 oz.) which was a good cut, tender and flavorful. The augratin potatoes were uniquely prepared and absolutely delicious. Service was swift and courteous. A "must go" place. Stay away from the filet..not much bang for the buck! Can't wait to try the rest of the menu!!
