xNnZ5ksBY1gwwTV2Btb4Ag This is a gorgeous restaurant. It's exactly the style and decor I love: rustic tables and finishings with beautiful lighting and a gorgeous bar.

Speaking of the bar: we sat at it! The bartender was genuinely kind and knowledgable. We saw him making cocktails with fine detail to sieving juice and using great gin, so we asked why there was no cocktail menu? "Because I hate making them - if you're having dinner, wine is the answer". He laughed and so did we. I appreciate the honesty of the answer!!

For food - the apps blew us away. We had the lamb steamed bun, a riff on Momofoku's and arguably bolder, brighter flavours then their inspiration. The veal tartare was also lovely. Our mains were huge, too big to finish. I would have been happy with one more appetizer to share between us and that's it. Next time I go back, that will be my strategy.
