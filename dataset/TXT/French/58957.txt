rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w The scallop risotto was literally to die for.  TO DIE FOR!  If we weren't in such a nice restaurant, I would have used my finger to scrape every bit of rice and sauce into my eagerly awaiting mouth!  MMMMMMMM!!!  It's four months later, and I can STILL taste it!

We had the tasting menu, so each course wasn't the biggest, but in the end, we were both severely full.  Although I loved our meal, I think next time I'll opt for the full sized risotto, because it was just that amazing!  

The chocolate souffle was likewise out of this world!  I've never had one quite so soft, airy, and fluffy.  It was like eating a cloud and put all other souffles I've had to shame.  Actually, in retrospect, I can't say I've ever had a proper souffle, now that I know what they're supposed to be like.

The rest of the meal was very good, but not outstanding.  My duck was a little dry.  The sea bass was nicely done.  I don't remember much else.  On that note, I'd probably rate the food a 4 or a 4.5.  The risotto and souffle were 10's, so that evens out to 5 overall.  

Regardless, service was impeccable.  We were waited on hand and foot and made to feel as though we were the only two in the restaurant.  Every dish was explained, from ingredients to eating etiquette, and there was just the perfect amount of personal conversation to make it seem as though we were all friends and that the staff really cared about who we were.  Immaculate!  I've never had such service!  They even matched our dinner napkins to our clothing colors!  So crazy!

It was a lovely (albeit pricey) birthday dinner from the boyfriend!  Le Cirque is a lovely restaurant for a special occasion, and it's perfectly situated for an after-dinner show with Cirque.  :)
