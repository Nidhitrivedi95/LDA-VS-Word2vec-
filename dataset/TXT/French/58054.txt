rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A After our lackluster dinner at Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill for dinner, I really was keeping my expectations low when we walked into Bouchon's for brunch.  First of all, unless you ask someone who works at the Venetian, you'll never find the restaurant.  We wandered through the Venetian shops and the Casino level and then finally found out that we needed to take the elevator to the 10th floor.  Oh well, helped us build up our appetite.  The atmosphere is light and airy with lots of sunlight coming in from the floor to ceiling windows.  We started with peach bellinis and the spiced beignets, which were both delicious.  For our entrees, I order the omelet du jour, one of us had the croque madame, and the two of us got the Kobe burger.  As we were waiting for our entrees the bread and butter came out.  The butter tasted amazing, and well as the blueberry jam,  but we all raved about the butter.  So far so good, much better than our experience at Mesa the night before.  When our entrees came out, I was truly stunned with excitement, my omelet was amazing, it was filled with bacon and summer squash and it came with two slices of the airiest brioche toast ever.  But what really put me over the top was the stack of bacon that came with it.  I'm not talking about the two or three slices, but a pile.  It was stacked on there like fries.  I was in protein heaven.  The Kobe burgers that my friends had were beautiful, as well as the the croque madame.

The service was amazing, our server kept out glasses filled and brought us ice when we asked.  I can't wait to go back, hopefully for dinner next time.  Maybe one day even making my way up to the French Laundry for the tasting menu too.
