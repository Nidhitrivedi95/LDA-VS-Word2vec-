4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I came in expecting a bit more, the general atmosphere was nice and the wait staff was prompt and courteous but overall the food was a let down.

The bread was very good but everything after that was too salty. My girlfriend and I ordered the Butternut Squash soup, Duck Confit, Full order of mussels, and the Skate Wing. Our appetizers took a little too long to come out but our waiter kept us updated and was nice about it.

Butternut Squash- rich and creamy with bits of ham and spinach, it would have been delicious if it wasn't so salty! After about two spoonfuls it felt like you were licking salt.

Duck Confit- pretty good portion and the overall taste was decent but the fat was not rendered out so there was huge chunks of fat where it should have been crispy skin.

Full Order of Mussels- Lots of plump mussels in a tasty broth with onion. not too bad as well, I can see why people recommend ordering the full order as it comes with delicious skinny frites. Again it has the same problem as the Butter Nut Squash soup in that it the broth was much too salty.

Skate Wing- Crispy and flaky. I really wanted to love this dish, the mushrooms and red sauce on top was delicious and the first few bites were heaven for me. But towards the end of the fish I could feel the crunch of salt crystals and I couldn't even finish it. The mashed potatoes were also forgettable.

The overall bill wasn't terrible for the amount of dishes we got but honestly I think we will go somewhere else next time to get our French Bistro fix.
