gh6__q2WXFuyN8gt6VAnWw Excellent food and The price is very good. The owner is part Portuguese and that part knows how to cook.

Bacalhau assado was my choice. Very good and not salty. We had an appetizer which was shrimp and cheese melted. Very good as well. A little distant, but worth the way.

They have an amazing dance floor and have dance shows. Tango, salsa, ballroom dances. Very cool.
