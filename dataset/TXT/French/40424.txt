KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA I love this small, cute bistro overlooking the water at Desert Shores. Excellent wine with knowledgable staff that helps you select. The patio is gorgeous in any season. We dined in winter and it was warm & comfortable near the fire places. Escargot was garlicky & buttery- perfect to dip your crust French bread in. Flat iron steak seriously melted in your mouth and was cooked exactly as I ordered. Love this place.
