An excellent locally owned spot, with a good modern vibe, and serves up great and fresh food.  And if you want to save some cash, there's a great $30 for $15 deal on Local Dines (https://www.localdines.com/phoenix?ref=19485).

I had the Chicken Parmigiano.  I love that Local Bistro has its own spin on such a common dish.  The chicken is flattened and breaded more like a schnitzel, covered with gruyere cheese, and a tomato ragu is served on the side.  Not only is it a tasty dish, but its nothing like the Chicken Parm you can order in any other restaurant.

The only thing that I didn't appreciate was the noise.  Wow, it is loud inside.   The tables are also a little uncomfortably close together, but you won't have to worry about any eavesdropping on you.  In fact, you'll barely be able to hear the people you're trying to listen to.
