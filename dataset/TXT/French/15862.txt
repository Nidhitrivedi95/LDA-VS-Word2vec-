6Hj4AQ5DDGf7tsVk6LscLQ We did dinner last night and it was awesome. Went on a travelzoo voucher.. The service was excellent. (A very bubbly, energetic gal) we shared the diver scallops. They were outstanding. I had the steak and Wendy had the halibut. We def will go back. The prices are high... However for food of this quality you expect as much.
