SJo_IjvzdRtCvZVN0cbrRQ We've been to the Blue Door multiple times and always loved it.  I think their coffee is great and the food, though slightly overpriced, has always been pretty good. Sitting inside seems very crowded and tight, so we have always gone during summer months and opted for the patio.   Just went for the first time this summer, waited about 30 minutes for a patio table, and when we were finally seated we realized the menu has changed.  Apparently now there is a "weekday" menu and a weekend "Brunch" menu.  I loved their crepes and my husband loved their corned beef hash, but since we went on Saturday it was the brunch menu and neither of those were on the menu (and looking at their website they no longer seem to have crepes at all =(...)  We took a brief glance at the menu ($15 for bacon and eggs!!!!!), saw they had changed it and raised prices and left.  Probably won't be back, which is a bummer.
