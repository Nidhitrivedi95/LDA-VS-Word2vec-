rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A We ate at Bouchon for dinner.

Their menu was so adorable. It was made out of paper and folded around each of our table napkins. We have to unfold it to see the menu choices.

Our server was excellent. He was good at explaining what off-menu items there are. He also kept our table clean from the bread crumbs we get from eating their bread.

Our water was kept filled by other waiters and our dishes were always taken away as soon as we were finished with them.

My recommendations:
- Escargot: The escargot is served with a puffy pastry on top. The pastry was nice and crunchy and complimented the escargot pretty well.
- Pate: Very yummy spread.
- Mussels entree: The sauce and the mussels tasted pretty good.

For my entree I ordered the salmon which came with couscous. My dish did not taste salty at all and the salmon was not dry. However, I did taste some of the Steak "Diane" entree and it was pretty salty. The mussels entree was delicious though. The only thing I don't like about this entree is the big amount of fries they give. I try to avoid fries, but that's just me.

I would come again in the future because of the great service and delicious appetizers. I will probably try something new for the entree though.
