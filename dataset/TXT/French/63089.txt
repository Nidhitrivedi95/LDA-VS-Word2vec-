SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA My wife and I have enjoyed fine dining in Cleveland for 30 years and this is our new #1 all-time favorite.   The service was way above anything we have experienced with impeccable timing on everything food related and also drink refills, water and even clearing plates once a course was completed.  We each tried different appetizers and entries and shared all because they had their own outstanding flavors.  Our server was exactly correct when she told us that once we had the French Toast appetizer, we'd have to have it every time.  Very unique dish.  Sharing a Napolean at the end was a perfect finish to a terrific culinary event.  Compliments to the entire staff, they are top notch!
