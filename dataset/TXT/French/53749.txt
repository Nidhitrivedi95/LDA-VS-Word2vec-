qmh6zxtJ8C8-YiUPv7ySlw Hubby and I ate at the DB brasserie for our 6th wedding anniversary after staying at the Wynn for three nights. Overall the food, service and drinks were excellent. I enjoyed my husband's short ribs a little more than my duck though. At the end of the meal they presented us with a slice of anniversary cake. Nice touch to the end of a lovely meal.
