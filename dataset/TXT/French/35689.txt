htQgj-ANQpZGpIpkkrEmyQ Yesterday was my first time dining at Inspire. I would agree with some yelpers that the restaurant was hard to find- they are located on the right side of Main Sushi. They have a little burgundy flag banner at the front of the entrance with the restaurant name.

Now let's get to the food! We ordered the Tom Yum Mussels to start, then moved to the Chicken and Waffles as well as the Udon Carbonara. We finished off our meal with a caged chocolate mousse.

The mussels was a perfect starter as suggested by our server. The broth was light but flavourful with a perfect accompaniment of 2 pieces of crispy garlicky toasts to dip into your broth. The broth had slight kick to it but not over powering. The mussels itself was juicy and fresh.

The chicken and waffles were delicious! The crispy outer skin with the juicy succulent meat.. As for the waffles it was topped with a little dollop of herb butter and drizzled with a spiced maple syrup. I can see how some people may think that there are too many flavour profile in this dish however once I had all of the components together they worked harmoniously. 

The UDON CARBONARA!!! This was a dish I could eat day in and day out! The creamy sauces balances with the savoury flavour of the chorizo and bacon! Who can say no to that! The dish also had a hint of a kick which was a nice surprise! 
 
We finished off with a caged chocolate mousse. It was a tasty but nothing out of the ordinary. If I wasn't so stuffed I would probably try their banana bread waffles. 

I definitely will be back. In fact I made a second reservation prior to leaving. 

Why I am giving this place a 4 out of 5 because service for our food was somewhat slow and the restaurant was not busy at all. Including us they only had about 6 tables. I will be trying different starters and dessert when I am back again next week. Hopefully these will change my rating slightly.
