5fquJHY2hMX9tPRD5s0t5g Went here on a Saturday night as roosters was within walking distance of our hotel and it did not disappoint. The bbq chicken was great and my date enjoyed her pork. We arrived with reservations and were seated immediately. The service was great and I had some of the best fried oysters I've ever eaten here. Will be going back.
