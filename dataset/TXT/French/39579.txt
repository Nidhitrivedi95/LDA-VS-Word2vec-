jwYnXuaSqtpiNwyU72Vm9Q Probably one of the better restaurants I ate at during my visit to Montreal. They weren't kidding when they said the seafood is so fresh. I had the most amazing sea bass here. I loved the labneh. The octopus was good. The restaurant was clean, spacious. Even though the restaurant was packed, I could have a quiet conversation here without having to overhear my neighbors. They waitstaff was too busy too refill our waters at times. I would definitely recommend going here if you're having a seafood craving.
