Hands down the best crepe spot in Vegas. I love the texture and the flavor of their sweet crepe batter. I've had the nutella twice, and also the apple brown sugar. I'm a chocolate fan, so of course I am going to keep going back for the nutella.

That muffin tho. Just take one look, and you know it's legit. Muffin top action is to the max, just how I like it. IT's ALLLLL TOP, BABY!!!!

I'm a huge croissant fan, and it wasn't my favorite. I have yet to try their almond croissant. That one's also a HEAD TURNER. 

GET IN MAH BELLYYYYYYYY.
