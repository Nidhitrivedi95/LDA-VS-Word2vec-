Dcj69NZJnbJhK-YHP_nULA Been there like three or four times, each time it's great.  I think I had the mussels with chorizo once and was like "so what" but every other time it's been a really good meal.  I really like their bolognese with the pepper farfalle.... it's really about as good as that could be.  The frites: above average, not perfect... but honestly that isn't a magnet to me anyway.  The beers: excellent.  They're heavy on the Belgian selection as they should be, but there's always a couple I haven't had before... come Grand Cru or this or that.  Sometimes it's pretty busy... I'd recommend eating early, there isn't a lot of tables there.  I dunno how people go 2 stars on this, seriously... I mean I think 3 is starting to get bad.... 2, really?  Maybe if you don't like beer... but that's like going to a pizza place knowing you hate pizza.  How many times you been there... try it again, goddamn.
