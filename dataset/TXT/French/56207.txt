rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Have been coming here for the past 10 years and on this visit is the first I've felt that it's gone downhill quite a bit. Overall the fries and entrées don't taste as great and the preparation lacked the same level of care. They also don't include baguette and butter like they used to which was disappointing. I am likely to skip Bouchon for future visits.
