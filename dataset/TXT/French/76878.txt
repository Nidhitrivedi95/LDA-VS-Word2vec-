ysJo5Jdo29XOBCnKrbUKWg I've gone to Paris 66 twice now. The first time I went, it was soon after the restaurant opened. They were full, but not busy, and we got a table right away. We waited maybe 45 minutes and got half of the food we ordered. The rest of us just had to wait another maybe 30 minutes or so for the rest. The food was pretty good when it finally came out. Since the restaurant was new and the manager had been apologetic about the whole thing, I figured I'd give it another try.

I went again today with some friends. It took over an hour for our food. First we were told it was taking awhile because of some New Years Eve event they had planned later in the night (I wonder why they would open for lunch today if they thought they could not handle it. This is definitely not a valid excuse if you ask me).  Then the waiter came back and told us apparently the kitchen never got our order.  In the time it took for the waiter to realize he hadn't given the kitchen our order, they ran out of a component of one of the dishes as well (and note that my friend was incorrectly charged a dollar more for the original thing he ordered instead of the replacement dish he received..) When we finally got our food, there were a couple of problems with it too. In addition to the food taking forever, the server wasn't very attentive to us either (didn't refill our water, didn't give a spoon for soup, etc).  Even replacing a salad (brought it out w/wrong dressing) took 5-10 minutes.

I will DEFINITELY not be going back to this restaurant. While the food is actually pretty good (though I'm sure it would taste better warm), the service has been pretty terrible both times I've been there.
