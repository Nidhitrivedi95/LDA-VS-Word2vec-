mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q Probably my favorite restaurant in the US. EVERYTHING tastes delicious. Love the garden salad, the crab salad, the sliders, the langoustine, the steak tartare, the puree, the french fries, the Iberico ham, the onglet aux echalottes....this is a fantastic experience. In fact, when I go to Vegas, I have to eat there every night because I do not know a better restaurant. Emmanuel and Yannick are the managers and they will give you a service comparable to the quality of the food. Steve runs the kitchen and you can't help but to talk to him. The persons helping you on the other side of the bar are friendly, smart, efficient and professional. If you own a business where customer service is important (to me, it is always important), go, enjoy the food, open up your eyes and ears and learn...unbelievable experience.
