They're large for sure, about the size of the palm of my hand and reasonably priced at $3.50 each. No creative flavors available - just the classics of chocolate, caramel, coffee, vanilla, pistachio & raspberry.

The large cookie size meant that the ratio of shell to filling was way off (too much cookie) and my raspberry was a tad stale. Service was pretty crap too - the attendant couldn't have been more disinterested.

Honestly, it's my fault - who buys a French pastry in an Italian-themed casino? Lesson learned.
