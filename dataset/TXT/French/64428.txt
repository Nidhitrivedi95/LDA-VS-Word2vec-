tCSlpwJQ4CZsUEMZeH2SFg We reserved a table at Cafe Monte last Saturday for a special occasion dinner. The front half of the restaurant really does feel like a french bistro, and with a wonderful duet of a trumpet player and a piano player, the music was great.

Service was attentive. We brought a bottle of wine from our cellar and corkage was $15. Our server noticed the bottle in its neoprene carrier as soon as she showed up and asked if we had white or red, and what style glasses we wanted. 

My husband and I were both dying to try the steak frites, since we loved that dish in our favorite restaurant Paris. He ordered his au poivre, and I ordered mine with Bearnaise sauce. I'm docking Cafe Monte one star because they completely undercooked my steak. I ordered it medium, and I received a steak that was rare, as in cool in the middle. My husband ordered his medium rare and he also received a rare steak.

I prefer my steaks medium, but will eat just about any steak on either end of the spectrum of doneness so as to avoid sending it back and risking spit, so I kept my mouth shut. Be prepared to have your steak undercooked if you eat here.

Aside from that one issue, everything was great. Hopefully they'll get some more knowledgeable cooks in the kitchen in the future.
