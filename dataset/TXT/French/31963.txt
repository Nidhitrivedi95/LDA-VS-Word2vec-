gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA to this day, best surf and turf I've ever had. I saw a menu item for lobster, and one for fillet mignon. I asked if I could combine them and they not only said yes but made it come out in style.  

it was three pounds of lobster in a pink champaign and cheese sauce.  and a pepper crusted fillet mignon on a potatoe medallion, side of cauliflower and carrot puree.  delicious. 

service was top notch. server was knowledgeable, and always on the spot.  he did not splash the wine, and delivered the food with practiced expertice.   I can't find a single thing to say as a negative.  and I have bought long about it. 

top of the palms, excellent view at sunset of Vegas. great atmosphere, great service, great food, and great quality.
