4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Past few years Ive stayed in numerous hotels at the strip and always passed this restaurant by. Every time I had passed this location I have seen it packed. But never was able to give it a try because my friends always had different suggestions and love ayce buffets. I was finally with a group of office mates that wanted to grab breakfast food, so I suggested this spot since it had 6k reviews. I had to order the steak and eggs which was about $30 but well worth it. Came with 2 pieces of bread, 3 eggs your choice on how you wanted it cooker and a thinly sliced steak that was enough for breakfast, I asked for medium cooked but of coarse since the steak was too thin its hard for them make it medium. Great service and all my buddies said it was an amazing choice as well.
