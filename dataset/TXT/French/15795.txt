6GCbZASjMnAPYBWLc_z30g We were just here for our 25th anniversary this morning. Place was semi empty. Took 10 minute to get a seat. Took 15 minutes once seated to ask if we are going to get served. Ordered a decaf and late. Took another 10 minutes to get my decaf and it was cold. We were still craving the menu so we left and headed to the desert ridge location. Thanks for waiting out time.
