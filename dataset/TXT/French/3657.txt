20wc6SRqbiJ6SfqAaA6-Iw Henri's is not, as others have remarked, the cheapest joint in town for buying a bottle of wine or a nice cheese. The stock they have is great in both regards, however (confirmed by my Parisien other half), and well worth splashing out if you're looking to treat yourself. A particularly nice 'saint-marcelin' cheese stands out in our memory, and they also stock a variety of other French goodies. 

What takes us back time and again, however (as well as them being just round the corner from our flat) is their bread, croissants, and coffee. The croissants, pains au chocolat etc are really a cut above what you'll find in most other places in Edinburgh, and are not overly expensive (less than £1 each). I highly recommend their 'escargot chocolat'- essentially a danish-like pastry with chocolate chips. Get there early though- most bread and pastries seem to disappear by early afternoon!

Sandwiches are also excellent value, made fresh with lovely ingredients: try the 'Loire': Goats cheese, pesto, apple & salad.  The staff are friendly and helpful, and it's a nice place to sit if you can bag one of their 2-3 indoor tables. That's probably one of the only gripes we have- there's often not enough space, except in the summer when there's more seating outside.

In summary: fantastic spot for a croissant/sandwich and a coffee (especially in summer), or for spoiling yourself with a genuinely French treat.
