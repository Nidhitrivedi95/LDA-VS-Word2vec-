3jKUbhGSjFTv5jZ0wnW0xA Excellent French food in a classic bistro atmosphere. Duck confit was superb, a big hit, steak was perfectly cooked and lamb shank was fantastic. Service was slow, due to kitchen, the wait staff was excellent. Wine list is very pricey compared to the cost of the food, we made the mistake of ordering Québécois red wine, do not follow in our footsteps. Overall a great experience, definitely authentic French cuisine.
