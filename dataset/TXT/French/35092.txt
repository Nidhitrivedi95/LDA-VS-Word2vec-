HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw Still love this place, but with an asterisk.  We frequent the bar for their amazing happy hour, out of this world drinks, and friendly mixologists.  And now that food is included in the happy hour, we will definitely be frequenting this place more often.

The asterisk is...I think I'll only come here for the bar.  The last time we ate in the restaurant, I was really disappointed in the service, waiter, and food.  I came with a bachelorette party and had been talking this place up to my friends, but our experience in the restaurant was far less superior than my visits to the bar/lounge area.

So my advice?  Stick to the bar, come at Happy Hour to enjoy food and drinks at half price, and have a great time with the bartenders.
