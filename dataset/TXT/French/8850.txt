4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Just getting around to writing a review for this great spot.   The view is spectacular from the patio (we always get patio seating here) and a great place to just sit and people watch.  

My husband and I dined here for about 3 hours just "noshing" on several different appetizers plus drinks.  This is a great way to spend the afternoon and everything we ordered was perfectly prepared and delicious.  We both had the soup du jour which was LOBSTER BISQUE. It was truly wonderful but we ordered a shot of sherry for the soup, which to our disappointment should have been in the soup to begin with.  Not a big deal since everything else was over the top.

We went back for dinner and sat on the patio again.  And again, the food was memorable as was the ambience.

More recently 2 of my friends and I had lunch here and we all loved it so much we've decided to make this our favorite lunch spot.

One ordered the LEMON THYME SALMON.  She said it was the best salmon she'd ever had and I had to agree.  It was just a bit rare in the center which is what it's supposed to be and the lemon thyme flavor shone through.  

The other One ordered a steak, done medium rare and she said it was perfect.  I didn't taste the steak but she loved it.

I ordered one of my favorite dishes TROUT GRENOBLAISE.  Wow.  It was absolutely fabulous.  The sides we ordered were shared and there wasn't a thing we could find to complain about here.

Service was a little on the slow side but it was crowded and we were in no hurry.    If you want patio seating next to the railing you need to get there just before they open so you can be seated among the first.  It's worth it just to sit and watch the fountains and the throngs of people walking by.   Take your time here.
