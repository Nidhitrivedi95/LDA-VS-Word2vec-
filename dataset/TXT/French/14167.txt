58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw I believe that Daphne M.'s review says it all. This really is a must when you're in town. My visit wouldn't have been complete without it. Indeed, life itself is more complete now that I've been here.

Food: I ordered the hot cast iron thing with meats and beans all around. It was scrumptious! My wife ordered the salmon with baguette because the restaurant didn't get its bagel delivery in the morning, boo! Both were delicious nonetheless. Drink the vanilla latte!

Service: extremely friendly and responsive.

Decor: it's tight in here, but everything is extremely clean, especially the restrooms.

Try to get here early because the line can get really long! Park one block over at the public meters and walk briskly (to stay warm).
