The only minor issue that bothered me throughout dinner was the tap water provided at room temperature. I wonder if this was a devious ploy so that one would be encouraged to order bottled water service or pay up for any beverage. 

On the very plus side. Although this place comes across as upscale (as it is in Yorkville after all) and pretentious (with all the dinners in their designer outfits), I do find this place accommodating when I show up in much more casual attire (i.e. shorts and golf shirt). That's just me, as you may want to dress like the Jone's. 

At any rate, dinner was fine. Leisurely with well above average service.
