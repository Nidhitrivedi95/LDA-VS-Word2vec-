aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw I'm in Vegas. It's a place to indulge. So did I? Of course I did! I indulged on the great richness of Bouchon Bakery located in the Venetian near the guest elevators!

I was staying in the Palazzo but Bouchon's was just a short 5 minute brisk walk away. I love the fact that the bakery, is just a simple and open store. It's not big and extravagent - just an open storefront you might see walking down the street in Europe. Once my friends and I got here, there were so many choices starting from breakfast items like croissants, breads to dessert like massive chocolate chip cookies, macaroons and dessert beignets!

I eventually ordered:
* Almond brioche - it's almost like almond brittle baked on to a nicely toasted slice of brioche. Nice and buttery.
* Chocolate chip cookie - A little too sweet for me but lots of butter :)
* Assortment of macaroons - I got the box set which included every flavor - strawberry, orange, pistachio, vanilla, chocolate, espresso. The box set was $17.50 which is a steal when you do the math. Individual macaroons were $3.50 each. These macaroons weren't your normal sized macaroons either, they're about 3-4 times as big which makes me gladly hand over my money for these bites of delicious goodness.
* Beignets - They come at $3.75 for two so I got both flavors that they had that day, raspberry and chocolate. The raspberry one was nice and sweet but was way overfilled with too much raspberry jelly - a little hard to eat. The chocolate one was heaven - rich chocolate ganache inside of a chocolate flavored beignet with chocolate sprinkles on top. Can it get any better than that?!

The macaroons were definitely the highlight of the bunch. They were sweet, crunchy, creamy and divine.

I'm coming here everytime I'm in Vegas to get some Macaroons and try a few more of their delectable pastries.
