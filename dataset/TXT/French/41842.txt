KRgTdfs4oVFUcATMfAoR4A Everything looks delicious on the menu it was difficult to choose. I went with one of their discovery menus as did my daughter where they give you 4 courses with the intention of tasting one another's dishes.  She had the land menu, I selected the sea menu. Brilliant decision! We had beef carpaccio/salmon tartare, veal kofta/shrimp ravioli, lamb chop/cod, and for dessert, molten chocolate cake with caramel ice cream! My husband and other daughter both selected filet mignon- mouth watering tender and succulent! My biggest surprise was the shrimp ravioli. It is served with a coconut sauce, Or at least there was coconut in the sauce.  It doesn't matter.  It was divine!  Could have eaten that as my main entree! We were very impressed! There is a window to view the kitchen from the dining room. Looks like 2 chefs did it all!! The wait staff comprised of 3 women.  All very pleasant and attentive! We did not have a reservation, but they were able to accommodate us on a Friday night at 7pm! I'm so happy they did!
