utYpyFOjNisHl1h7lDGSGA When entering, I sat at the bar not noticing the HUGE sign stating restaurant upstairs.  The bar had an amazing assortment of wine and cheeses but that's it compared to the restaurant.  It was perfect for me.  Cheeses were so creamy and sardines delicious.  Service was impeccable.
