4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw May 25, 2016 -- A return visit to Las Vegas and of course a return visit to Mon Ami Gabi.  Reikki Gal wanted to watch the dancing waters at the Bellagio across street so we sat at the outside café.  Dimitris was our server and did a terrific job.  We ordered a bottle of Chardonnay wine, the house made pate and the duck special (orange sauce) all delicious.  The 'house' treated to an amuse de bouche of carrots with shallot and champagne vinegar dressing which was delightful.

We shared a light dinner but there was plenty to eat and very enjoyable.  My wife is a nurse and quite the humanitarian.  A homeless person came by.  We had leftover duck, potato au gratin and French bread which she gave him, he was greatly appreciative and gobbled it down...best gourmet meal of his life we guessed and only meal he had that day!

The quality of the food is amazing and the service is flawless. There was a couple from Paris, France that were sitting next to us.  They were equally pleased.  We will go  back for breakfast before  returning home!
