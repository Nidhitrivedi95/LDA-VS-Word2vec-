YMcGgFQDEarRQ22ml1z_VQ Loved our visit here yesterday, I was so happy to finally get to try out these delicious traditional crepes and especially to hang out with the kind, cool, super friendly gentleman owner and chef. The beautiful, folded like a flower, pretty, apple crepe with caramel sauce was a delight and I can't wait to go back and try more of the savoury options. 

The cafe is lovely and tiny and white with sweet pieces of vintage ceramics and old family photos as decor. There are other lovely baked goods here, but the focus is almost entirely on the different kinds of white and sarrasin crepes, thin, perfectly made, awesome. Just wonderful.
