rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A My husband and I have been wanting to eat breakfast/brunch at Bouchon for many years. But let's face it, it's Vegas and we never get up in time. We finally did, as we had an early flight, and I'm sad we hadn't sooner. My husband ordered the French Toast. I'm very picky when it comes to French Toast (I think my mom's is the best). Wow! Best French Toast ever! Don't tell my mom. I ordered the omelette de jour with button mushrooms, sun dried tomatoes, and cheddar cheese. Awesome! A slice of brioche with raspberry jam was a great ending to the meal. We each had coffee. Only a $38 bill, not bad for a great meal in Vegas. 
The service was top notch, from the hosted to the waitress to the servers. Our coffee cups never went empty. 
We will make this a must every time we are in Vegas....even if it means sacrificing some zzz's....it's totally worth it.
