bMiyGPaMqF0svjseW1UR_g Amazing.  We were wandering around the area looking for a place to get a coffee at night and stumbled across this place. Although it's labelled as a Cafe in Yelp, it's definitely a full-on restaurant.  Ample seating inside and a patio that seats about 10 (although it's where all the smokers from inside stand, if that's a big deal to you).

The latte about on par with all the other latte's i had in Montreal, but the dessert was incredible.  We ordered the pudding chomeur to nibble on and ended up devouring it in minutes. It was the best dessert of the weekend.  Definitely going to be coming back to this place next time i'm in Montreal to see if the entrees are just as good. Price was very reasonable too at $8 for the pudding.

Service was also excellent and didn't mind at all that we only were ordering dessert/coffee and not a full meal.  He even helped us pick it and wasn't shocked to find out we had thoroughly enjoyed it.
