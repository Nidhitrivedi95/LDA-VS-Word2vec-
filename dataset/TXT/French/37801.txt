jaSowNITPRRCYpPb3_pjdA After reading positive comments from a local food critic, I decided to go and visit the new bistro.
The host was very accommodating, polite, super courteous an overall great guy.
We are a party of 4, we ordered 2 escargot appetizer and was surprised to find them very salty, we told our waiter and he quickly returned the escargots to the kitchen, after a few minutes he brought them back and we noticed that the escargot sauce was white sauce instead of garlic butter, the chef has added cream to the dish to tone down the excessive salt, it's was awful and also the dish was cold, the manager returned the escargot to the kitchen to reheat, he personally brought back the dish and was very apologetic, we all tasted the escargot and by now I could have used it to patch a hole in my car tire.
The fries where also cold and that was exchanged, they of course removed the escargot charges from our bill.
Overall, the place is nice, maybe that was a bad day as they just opened and are used to the tourist versus local crowed, I'll give them another couple month and then retry again..
We are foodies, we don't have the luxury of being recognized as some local food critics that get great tasting food.
