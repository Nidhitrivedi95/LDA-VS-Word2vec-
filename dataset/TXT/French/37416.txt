j0baDQfMAGDm_QGdFMmb-Q What a great dinner Last week with Jean Christophe (pictured) and his amazing wife Segolene! The bread and butter cream sauce was so enticing - and for dinner I had the FDB "French Duck Burger" yep that's right and it was worth every penny!!!!!
Oh and just a little wine plug "the clos du bois RSV Cabernet was amazing
