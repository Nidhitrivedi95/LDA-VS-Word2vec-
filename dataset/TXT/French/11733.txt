4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Conveniently located near our hotel, we visited Mon Ami in search of a good a la carte brunch with options galore (and AC on that 112-degree day). Great find! Thank you Emily H. for your tip!

Our party of four all started with the Orange Juice & Boost of Vitamin C. We figured we'd need all the Cs we could get to help with the full "Vegas" day ahead. We each ordered an omelet variation, and one of my friends ordered the Duck Confit Eggs Benedict. Everything was cooked just right and, despite a full restaurant, delivered promptly. 

A waiter that walked nearby dropped a glass that hit the floor spraying pieces everywhere and into my friend's ankle. It dampened the mood a bit; it wasn't a huge cut, but oddly enough did need the band-aid switched several times. It's not the waiter's fault, obviously. The manager stopped by to inquire about the incident and bring extra bandaids. Ultimately, they comped my friend's entree as a courtesy.  

There's so much on the menu I'd like to explore but didn't (classic crepes and the waffles!). The menu offers plenty of options to suit your mood. Whether you want to stay on the healthy side or completely splurge, they have something for everyone. I hope to visit again the next time I'm in the area.
