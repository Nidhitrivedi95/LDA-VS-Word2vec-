1ThbwFVBL9YA2oOM11iO7g For me, it's always been 5 stars for both food and service every time I've been to Delux.  I love it here.  What's there not to love?  The menu is succinct and their pate/terrine/charcuterie appetizer is melt in your mouth.  Ordered the sauteed rapini, french fries and oysters on a half shell also as part of our appetizer round.  Being Good Friday, we had to order fish :)  So, out came the black cod with mussels in a bouillabaise broth.  Lastly, the donuts with creme anglaise was masterful.  And the 2 bottles of Chinon, poured and refilled constantly didn't hurt, either.  I will always recommend Delux - I will always go back - and I love this place.
