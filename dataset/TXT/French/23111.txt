bzbNGyrTwWHAgg1CqkSgeg I found the Terrace Cafe with a "Weekday Brunch in Charlotte" Google search. I had a friend in town for a job interview and we were in desperate need of a brunch spot. I was ill-prepared for just how many restaurants only have weekend brunch. All of that to say, my expectations weren't super high. 

We began our brunch with the only downside of the experience--an extremely long wait! There were empty tables all around and folks were moving in and out somewhat quickly, but it. took. forever. Luckily, the wait was worth it. I ordered the Red Velvet Waffle. I was both excited and nervous about the choice. I mean, I LOVE some red velvet ANYTHING, but I'm also not a huge fan of exceedingly sweet dishes--especially for breakfast. I'm the girl that can only handle like 1/4 of a cupcake at a time. Max. The waffle was DELICIOUS, though, and just the right about of sweetness without being at all overpowering. My friend ordered the Lemon Poppy French Toast and was equally impressed! Our waiter was exceedingly charismatic, attentive (without being annoying), and just wonderful!

It was a somewhat accidental stumble-upon adventure. But, it was an all-around great experience and I will certainly be back!
