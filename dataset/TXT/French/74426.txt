xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g This is our 4th experience dining at the Eiffel Tower Restaurant, while the view is breath taking the "wow" factor wasn't there this time.  Can it be that we're used to seeing the view or it may be the new way they configured the tables.  Now small half round tables butted against the windows and so close to other couples that it doesn't feel as intimate.  My husband and I came (again) to celebrate our anniversary.  My husband ordered a couple of cocktails and I ordered 2 glasses of Pinot Noir.  We shared the kale salad that was a little over powered by a sweet yet tart dressing, tart cherries, walnuts and quinoa croutons that were a little soggy. Was a little disappointed that they didn't split the salad for us but served it along with 2 small plates so we divided it ourselves.  The NY steak and filet mignon was cooked to perfection and was delicious.  We shared the potato Anna - a crispy sliced buttery potato that was a tad too salty and green beans almondine that was very fresh and tasty.  For dessert we ordered the famous chocolate soufflé which was delicate and rich along with a cappuccino and an Irish coffee.  Our server, David then brought a small chocolate mousse on a plate with "happy anniversary" piped in chocolate around the rim... Very delicious!  We were then presented with and got to choose from an assortment of complementary petit fours.  So stuffed at this point but couldn't resist :)
David was the greatest, very friendly and made us feel comfortable, giving us the space to have a romantic dinner while making sure we were attended to.  At the end he chatted with us, thanking us for choosing to revisit.  Overall a very memorable evening.  If you haven't dined here yet, it is a must at least one time!
