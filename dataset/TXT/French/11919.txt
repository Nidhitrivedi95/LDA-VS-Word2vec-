4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Mon Ami Gabi is a slightly lit restaurant in which I almost tripped (jk). I came here for a friend's birthday dinner. I ordered the Steak Classic - medium rare - it came with really thin cut fries and the steak was topped with a pesto butter sauce. My only qualm is that the piece wasn't as tender as I had hoped for MR. For appetizers, we ordered escargot, mussles, and crab cakes. The crab cake was a little dry but the other two were fantastic.

There are so many other restaurants in Vegas I want to try so I probably won't be back for while. I'd recommend you give this spot a shot if you're in the area (Paris Hotel).
