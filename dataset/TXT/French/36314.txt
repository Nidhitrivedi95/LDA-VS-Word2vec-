i2dnic7VdQ3NyiQQWUXHbA Review for brunch: my friends and I got the eggs benedicts, omelette and french toast. None of them were particularly outstanding but they were all pretty good. The omelettes came with tomatoes and potatoes, but they were each one ingredient which I though was a but lacklustre.
The place is certainly very cute, and was quite busy. I've heard good things about their dinner, maybe brunch is just not their strongest point.
