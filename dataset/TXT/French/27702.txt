DOmVF9YKOvTkqjcgUwtOgQ Great atmosphere and they have. A nice patio overlooking the street. We had the seafood platter for two and it was quite enough for two.  The only problem was there was a piece of crab that was disgusting - brown, dirty stuff on it so we didn't eat that one.  They should look at that before putting it on someone's plate and wash it clean and don't serve it at all if it doesn't come clean.  Service was excellent.
