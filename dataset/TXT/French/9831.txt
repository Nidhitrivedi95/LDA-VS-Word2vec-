We ate here for lunch, right at the hottest point of the day.  It would have been a much nicer atmosphere if there were misters or something to cool me down, cause it was hot as a mofo out there!  It was so hot that our butter melted completely in 5 minutes.  I think this would be the only time I would ever prefer chilled butter over room temperature. We thought about sitting inside to escape the heat, but it was dark and depressing in the main dining room.

We started off with the mussels, which I liked after having one bite but with every bite I continued to take, they just kept getting worse and worse.  I had to quit after 3 bites because they became way to salty for my liking.  Also, there were about 3 unopened mussels, which is grounds for send-back...but I decided to go easy on them, until my entree that is.

For my main dish, I chose the seared salmon with a lemon butter sauce over orzo.  It was so bland and tasteless, I sent that bitch ass dish back.  The description on the menu made it sound so good,  and I was looking forward to that orzo, but it sucked in real life.  Sorry, but I have no pity for these huge casinos and I am expecting something not dissapointing when I'm dining at any one of them.  My bf liked his dish, though.  Maybe I chose the wrong thing, but I doubt I'll be giving them another chance to redeem themselves.

The view of the Bellagio fountains was entertaining, which was a plus.  Also, its right on the strip so people watching is fun also.  Thats about it as far as the positives go for me.  Oh, and the bread was really good.  Eh, I'll give 'em 2.5.
