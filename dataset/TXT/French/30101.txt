fRu_POqPowUo6nHSRMjOPw Went here for Valentines day. They had a set menu of 4 courses for $75 per person. I thought this was a pretty decent deal for being an upscale restaurant.

The menu we had consisted of
Soups - lobster bisque and a leek soup. Both were good but not amazing
Salad - tuna with scallops and a beet salad. The tuna was really good. It was sushi style tuna and the scallops were seared to perfection. The beet salad was also good but the tuna was way better
Pomegranate sorbet to "cleanse" the palette
Dinner - my wife had the beef tenderloin and I had the black cod. The tenderloin was cooked to perfection and tasted delicious. All of the other flavours it came with matched very well.
Desert - Chocolate mousse cake and a passion fruit custard (think creme brule). Both delicious

We were served glasses complimentary sparking wine to begin the evening. The servers were very attentive and prompt and the atmosphere was great.

All in all a nice place to eat for a special dinner.
