SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ The food had such a wide range of potential and I was afraid they wouldn't do anything very well. I was amazed by the rabbit and chorizo starter. One of the best things I have had with rabbit. Everyone at the table loved it. The drinks were fun and overall the plates were well proportioned and very tasty.
