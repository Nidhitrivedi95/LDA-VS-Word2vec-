SpkwuDQChxHlNwfnx7OWUA The poutines looked very nice. Fried done fresh to order.. However my boyfriend and I both suffered from food poisoning shortly after we finished our meal and left! Perhaps the improperly stored meat was the culprit? Only one guy working at the time and he seemed more focused on taking personal calls and stepping outside every few minutes to speak to a strange guy lingering by the door... 

Open to trying again. Hopefully the second experience will be much better than the first!
