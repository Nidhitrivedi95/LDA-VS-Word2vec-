50-xiTYmE6NERi-yJ6NvHw I was here for my birthday and the service was wonderful.  
My guests and I were seated in a private room decked with artwork mapping out streets in Paris. Great conversation starter.  The menu had a varied selection and I had the Beef Bourguignon with truffled Parisienne gnocchi, mushrooms & bacon... I would definitely have it again and the meal was also accompanied by pickles and house mustard which were perfect during dinner. My friends tried the chicken dishes and had rave reviews. Our server was very attentive and knowledgeable about the items. 

Very nice place and hopefully, I'll be back soon.
