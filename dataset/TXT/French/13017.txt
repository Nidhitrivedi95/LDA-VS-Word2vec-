4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Used to be lots of "French" restaurants out there, but now I realize how few remain after checking Mon Ami Gabi's menu with many authentic French offerings.   I'm not sure if the servers were truly French or just affecting an accent, but it works.  We had reservations and were seated promptly -- none of this sit at the bar while we find you a place.  I wasn't thrilled with the first table shown (near the bar and very noisy), so we were shown a much more peaceful table.    I had the baramundi special with a side of ratatouille which was excellent.  I'd wanted the pork tenderloin which was on the menu but they were out of it.  Already.  At 7 PM in Las Vegas.  Someone screwed up there.  But the fish was a worthy substitute.  Served with fingerling potatoes on a bed of deliciously flavored frisee.  My husband had the butternut squash with apple bisque.  It was fine.  Almost as good as an identical one I make at home.  He had a filet with merlot sauce.  Ordered medium rare, as it was served, yet, surprisingly dry.  And roasted beets which were very tasty.  Server was attentive but not hovering -- all I ask in a restaurant server.  Spouse had tarte tatin for dessert, I had chocolate mousse.
