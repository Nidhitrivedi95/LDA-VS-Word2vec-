rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A My friend and I had dinner here and were really happy.

Food was amazing,wait staff was attentive and atmosphere was great.

Only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5,we waited 35 min for a table even though we had reservations.  I had to go up twice before we got seated.

The food was so good, I will be taking my husband to the Yountville  location soon.
