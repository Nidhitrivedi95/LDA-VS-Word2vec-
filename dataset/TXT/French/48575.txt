ohMpNug5zWNxOlL6ShG7Ig Just finishing dinner. We cannot recommend this place highly enough. Loved the calamari. Bread unique and delicious. My vegetarian wife loved the broccoli and cauliflower. Our fantastic server Bill accommodated me by allowing me to order the steak frites even though it's only a offered on the lunch menu. A truly memorable dish, with the steak cooked perfectly.  Finished with the heavenly chocolate pudding cake.
