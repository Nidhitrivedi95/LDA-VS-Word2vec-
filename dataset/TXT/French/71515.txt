XcWlBj5oQgzKhR7Cxovj3w Review is for breakfast. Zinc is one of the fancier places to grab a bite in an airport: shiny wood furniture, decorations adorning the walls, and yes, the cuisine happens to be French too!

The food is okay, but very expensive relative to the portion size.  I tried to order the savory crepe but they ran out.  Mon Dieu!  That's like a bar running out of beer!  I got instead the breakfast croissant with bacon - decent, a bit petit, but definitely not worth the price.

My wife ordered the French Omelet - nice, fluffy omelet filed with ham and gruyere and topped with fried potato straws.  This dish was actually pretty good.  I've been watching you-tube videos of how Jacques Pepin makes French Omelets and the form and texture looks very similar to Zinc's.
