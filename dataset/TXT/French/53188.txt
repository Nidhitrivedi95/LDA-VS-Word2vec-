QeFsIMcIFIJcOrpthYL8jg Awesome place for dinner with a group! We took my best friend here for her bachelorette. Really wonderful and attentive service, absolutely delicious food in big but not insane portions, delicious drinks, and really fun live music (at least we had some on a Friday night). The decor is cool but not trying too hard, and the location is great--close to the water, lots of galleries, and bars. Would definitely go back.
