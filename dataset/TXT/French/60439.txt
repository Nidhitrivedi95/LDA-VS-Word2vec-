SBnpT6JDbah-5l_52GM5sw Nobody left this place disappointed...in our group anyway. Casual dining with plenty of seating & fancy plating. Great place to have a dinner date with a partner, group of friends or even family with older kids but not babies or toddlers. FYI, they don't have kids' menu. Great food that'll satisfy your palate. A bit pricey, but it's expected.
