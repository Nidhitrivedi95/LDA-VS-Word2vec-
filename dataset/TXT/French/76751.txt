ysJo5Jdo29XOBCnKrbUKWg Very disappointed after hearing about this place from friends and seeing the online reviews.  

My wife's entree was wrong -- TWICE.  First, the wrong main dish was delivered, and the correct entree arrived with soup not salad.  To make matters worse, the quiche crust was doughy across the entire bottom, and the "ham" was VERY fatty bacon.  

The response from the waiter?  A shrugged sorry and "do you want a side salad?"  When the hostess came by, she, too, shrugged a "sorry" and grinned a bit sheepishly.  I finally asked for the manager.  When she arrived, she thanked us for the feedback and offered a free dessert.

I wasn't asking to have my butt kissed or get free food, but in any PROFESSIONAL restaurant, the server would have immediately offered to take the quiche off the bill.   Very poor service.

I had the monkfish.  Never had it before.  The server said that is was "light and flaky."  Mine was dense and rubbery.  

There are too many other good restaurants in Pittsburgh for me to bother with this place again.  Ugh.  

Oh, and the french greetings and exclamations -- "C'est magnifique?" -- are a bit much.  The affectations were annoying.  Just give me good, friendly and honest service.
