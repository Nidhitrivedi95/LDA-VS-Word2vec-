4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw GREAT SEATING FOR CAESARS 50th ANNIVERSARY FIREWORKS!  My family and I made RSVP through Open Table for Sunday July 3rd. We got a table out in front of the outdoor patio. Initially my wife thought it would be too hot to watch the Bellagio fountains since it was still 98 degrees at our 8:15 PM RSVP however the air conditioning coming from the restaurant kept us very comfortable. I would highly recommend a table in the patio vs being inside. 

First of all the food and device was amazing!  We thought it was better than Gordon Ramsay's Steak Restaurant which we had dinner on Friday night.  We started off with a dirty martini for me and a French martini for my wife. Both came out cold and spot on. The escargot, the goose liver pate and the French onion soup ordered for appetizers was fantastic. Our kids ordered from the kids menu and had the steak. They devoured it.  I ordered the ribeye steak and shared with my wife. Glad we shared because it was a big steak!  

For the surprise of the evening...we got to see the fireworks celebrating Caesars Palace. It was spectacular to see the fireworks and then also see the Bellagio fountains at the same time.  What an awesome way to finish our last night in Las Vegas!
