rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w We bet a Thanksgiving dinner on Le Cirque and won big! 10 out of 10 for the set menu that started with lobster salad, proceeded to foie gras poelee -- amazing, light flavors with no "liver-y" tang -- scallops, and the wagyu beef that was unbeliveably rich. (You'll appreciate the small portions by the time you are done.) 

We dined with a 10-year-old, and the service was delightful and not at all stuffy; we were incredibly well taken care of in a friendly manner that made it a great family night. This meal was the focus and highlight of our trip to Las Vegas...stay in a cheaper hotel and eat at Le Cirque!
