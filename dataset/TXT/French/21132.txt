I went down a narrow unmarked alley that happened to have a string of shops wedged in between two soul-less office buildings. And there is this authentic french bistro, staffed with friendly french folks serving up excellent food. I had the hamburger lunch special. Very good, although even better if they would spring for slightly more lean meat (a bit greezy). Went back the next morning for breakfast, very good eggs.
