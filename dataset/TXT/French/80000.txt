ZuYsZvJ5r32Fs70vPXbRgw Winterlicious Dinner ($35) experience was A-OK.

Food is good but portions are small..... 

It was definitely NOT a good sight when your dinner mate kept looking at you with hungry eyes... lusting after more food...

We ordered:

Crab soup and lemon crème fraiche - smell good, taste good, but not enough
Charcuterie plate - meh.......

Braised New Zealand lamb shank, wild mushroom ragout and a thyme socca - fall off the bone tenderness
Sea bream Provencal with a bouillabaisse sauce - No sauce will able to make the overcooked fish taste better... and bouillabaisse sauce has no taste at all just the orange colour

Traditional crème brulée - smooth, with excellent vanilla flavour
Moelleux with vanilla ice cream - Warm Chocolate Cake and Ice cream.. awesome!!

The "Ain't Misbehaving" ($14) Cocktail I tried here is so so so GOOD!!! Well balanced with just a touch of spiciness... I think it is way better than the food I ate here! 

15% Auto Tip added during the Winterlcious... but the service here is top notch.

I think my dinner mate can eat 3 of the Winterlicious portions and still hungry.... so if you are looking for value, you won't find it here. However, it was a nice romantic place for an intimate dinner experience.
