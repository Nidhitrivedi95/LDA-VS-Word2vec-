ME6D5nLlfG0xZCtICOYDuw Although we had an awful experience the manager called 2 days later and apologized. He offered to have us come back as his guests to experience the brunch the way we planned to.  Thank you and we look forward to a different experience.

Incredibly disappointed.  We made a reservation after hearing such wonderful things about this brunch. I went on line and saw $12 bottomless mimosa and $25 brunch. Knowing that another couple would love this I asked them to go as well. My husband and I arrived first and we were seated immediately.  We sat at a 4 top in the middle of the restaurant and for at least 5 minutes we were completely ignored not a glass of water or a good morning from anyone as they passed our table. We were already put off because this is supposed to be an upscale French restaurant  .  The waiter finally comes to our table pours our water and tells us the bottomless mimosas are no longer- I told him it's on their website and he said they can't "it's illegal".  Manager comes over and basically said it is illegal and there is nothing he can do.  WHAT?  Its on their website - you could offer a free round or 2 to make up for it - you are false advertising!!  He said if we are unhappy we could leave -SO WE DID and had a wonderful brunch at The Fishmarket in Baxter Village.
