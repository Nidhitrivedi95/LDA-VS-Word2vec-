FChZqoNWuLZr5Lj28Cq7yg My boyfriend and I visited Tartine about a year and a half ago on our first trip together and we were delighted by it. Fast forward to this morning when we were driving through the city again, and decided to stop in. Pittsburgh is a very special city to us, and we were lucky enough to stop back in here before they moved next week! The food is always amazing, we ordered the lyonnaise potatoes, the salad, with lemon-basil dressing that tasted like summer, and I had the poire tartine. Bf also ordered an egg-spinach-bacon lardon-bachamel sauce thing with toast. Love love love the food!! They do a simple neck with great quality ingredients. The atmosphere is charming and I'm in love with the dog like everyone else. Lou, the owner personally greeted us and we shared a few minutes talking with him about his very interesting life. I love Tartine
