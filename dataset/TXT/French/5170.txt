3FlWR_osNPb8dcqLgHebHw I'm not sure what happened to this place but it's gone downhill! The server was quite nice, and it wasn't her fault because she was working really hard. But our wait time get our food was unacceptable. The eggs were over cooked and when the second ones came out they were yellow from all the grease! It was our 2nd time in about 2 weeks and both times were bad. Unfortunately there won't be a third. The servers definitely need more help!
