fVF5wayDyY6ZR5oJB1IK3g Definitely one of my favorite places for brunch. Lawrence menu and selection is original and different from the usual and common eggs Benedict's, omelettes and french toast plates that you get in almost every restaurant that serves brunch in Montreal. Lawrence will revisit the brunch classics by adding their personal touch and sublimate them with original and savory accompaniments. Lawrence is also very affordable and has a nice and trendy ambiance.
