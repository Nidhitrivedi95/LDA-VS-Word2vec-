4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Ever since I moved to Las Vegas people have told me about Mon Ami Gabi and when my boss came to town and wanted to meet for lunch and since he was staying at Bally's, MAG seemed like a perfect place to meet.

The decor was nice, the service good and attentive, the bread was nice and crusty so I expected to really enjoy my lunch.  Even the house Merlot was good.

I ordered the Steak and Frites with bleu cheese, one of my favorites.  The steak seemed to be pounded thin but did not have much steak flavor.  The bleu cheese was flavorful but it didn't raise my opinion of the food.  I found the frites to be too stringy, not crispy and was disappointed by them.  Had I been on anything other than a business lunch I would have sent it all back and ordered something else.

Again, the service and decor was fine and my boss ordered a cobb salad that looked great and he didn't say anything so I assume it was fine.  

I am not sure if I want to try again, on my own dime or not.
