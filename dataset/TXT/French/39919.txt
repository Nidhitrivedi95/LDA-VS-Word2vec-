K64Uw3a2Enh2MznpwRHWKQ Amazing!  We have driven by the non-descript outside of Razz's hundreds of times, but a Groupon brought us in.  We dine out a lot and know good restaurants here in the Valley, but the great thing about Razz's was we were gourmet dining with no trace of the Southwest flair that practically every restaurant in the Valley seems to have to grab onto.  One of the day's special appetizers, Stuffed Squash Blossoms had texture, creaminess and fantastic flavor.  Nothing is "normal" or "as expected" at Razz's; for example, the Chicken Scallopini was cheesey and limey at the same time.  The Arroz con Pollo was loaded with shrimp, chicken and sausage.  Portions were surprisingly large, not anticipated for this type of fare.  Fidel's service was impeccable!  Razz's could quickly become our spot for birthday and anniversary dinners.  The only negative:  the a/c in the dining room was set too high--it was too warm on this 100 degree day.  Can't wait to go back, hopefully before they close down for the summer! Thank you to all at Razz's for an amazing dinner!
