DQFuOd8tUebBAcV5iTGfDA So this is pretty bias because it's based on 2 macaroons... 

I just happened to walk by (while furniture shopping on King) and I saw that they had coffee and macaroons.

My bf didn't feel like getting anything, and since we were supposed to be seriously furniture shopping, I decided to just 2 macaroons to go.

I got a black forest and lavender.  I couldn't wait to try them, so as I was walking out, I took a bite out of the blackforest one.  It was hard, but the flavours were great.   There were actual cherries inside.  

After walking around for a bit, I decided to finished the lavender one as well.  I realized that they might freeze their macaroons to keep them fresh.  The lavender one was defrosted, and had a good crunch on the outside, and chewy, soft centre. It was very very lavender-ish.  If you don't like the flavour of lavender, do not get it.  I don't mind it, because the cream in the middle helped to balance it out. 

I've been meaning to go back to get the black forest one again and eat it right this time.  Also to try the other macaroons as well.  

I'd say this was a happy accident=)
Must try!!!
