4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Solid brunch place, but fellas, make sure you dress read the dress code before coming in here! We had reservations to take our friend out for her birthday, and since it was still in the 100s during the summer, my fiance wore a tank top. There's a clear sign on the door that gentleman are not allowed to wear tank tops and we were crossing our fingers hoping that we wouldn't be kicked out. Luckily the hostess let us know that we could keep our reservation, he would just have to work an oversized tall and long white tee. In my opinion, he looked ridiculous in it and much more inappropriate, but at least we got in and had a good laugh. I don't think you can go wrong with anything you order here for brunch, whether its Eggs Benedict or French Toast or Croque Madame. I would recommend trying to make reservations through Open Table and eating outside on a nice summer morning.
