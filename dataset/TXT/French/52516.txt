q0n4I-zqiI47xispOqc1lA Cute place and decent food, but poor service. When I asked for tap water, they told me that they stopped using tap water because of a bacteria in the water the previous month (how do they wash the dishes?). They brought me a very small 8 oz bottle of water. I said I would need another bottle of water, and the waiter said ok. 20 minutes later the water hadn't arrived, so I got up and asked for it (I was the only person in the restaurant). Then they charged me for the bottled waters. When I mentioned it was strange that they were charging for water given that they didn't have the tap water option that I asked for, they said sorry but I'd still need to pay. Strange and not good first experience, which is too bad because they have a beautiful back deck.
