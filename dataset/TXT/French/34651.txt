HojKatUfX4UHWaPqtl63NQ We went to this amazing restaurant just before New Year's Eve to celebrate my brother's birthday. It was Amazing, the view is breathtaking, the food is excellent and delicious, with the fine and elegant French touch. A big High Five also to the "crew". These guys rock! We'll come back for sure.
