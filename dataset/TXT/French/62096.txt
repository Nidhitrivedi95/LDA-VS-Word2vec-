SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ A culinary experience! This is an excellent restaurant for a date or intimate dinner. The atmosphere allows for conversation and you can see your food (somehow I find this rare in fine dining lately). 

Our table started with the Cheese plate appetizer which had a delicious assortment. Perfect for 3-4 people! We ordered the Ono, Rack of Lamb, and Bison Meatloaf. The Bison was a new experience for me and it was incredibly flavorful and well balanced. Would definitely order it again! 

I can't wait to be back. After this experience, I'll trust any dish on the menu. Thank you!
