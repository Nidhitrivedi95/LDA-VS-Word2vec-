IvFdi-vp823dTAWwHMT6xQ Going there for dinner and it is a Hong Kong style upscale Italian restaurant.  The food is average and relatively the price is expensive.

We have Seafood Combo that comes with Lobster bisque, Seafood pasta and tea/coffee that costs $35.99.  Changing to a different dessert Tiramisu or Cheese cake added another $3.  That is almost $40 dinner combo that you can go to a real Italian restaurant.

The other combo we ordered are 6oz lobster $33.99, 10oz steak, sole fillet, pig knuckle. The steak is ok.  The pig knuckle expected to have more meat but the one served has more skin than meat.  They have other set dinner that ranges from $20 to $30+

There is a live singer all the way singing all the various Asian songs.  If you consider the restaurant to be a sing and lounge, may be it can justified the price of the meal.
