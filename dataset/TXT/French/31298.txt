gh6__q2WXFuyN8gt6VAnWw This is my first time having Portuguese food and their food were really good. Restaurant has a very nice ambience with good music... I enjoyed my food and the staff were nice, she (I think she is the owner) even take time to explained their authentic food to us since we dont know anything about their dishes.  I highly recommended this restaurant! Support our local business...
