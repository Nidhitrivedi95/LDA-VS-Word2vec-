Ycp3Agr7dt71TZkeKV7jng We were in the area and decided to drop in for a sweet treat.

We had the chocolate chip walnut cookie, chocolate soufflé cake, chocolate bomb cake, lemon and apple danish. Ok so it was a few thousand calories but everything was delicious. Fillings were surprisingly not overly sweet, pastry was light and/or flakey.  Everything was nicely baked. 

Friendly service, clean establishment.  Well worth a visit when in the area.
