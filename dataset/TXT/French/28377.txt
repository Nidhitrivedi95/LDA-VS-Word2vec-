EEIz44ewHhOKmfTloAK13g Review based on visit from July 28, 2017 at 5:30pm

Having trouble making an RSVP on Opentable because it is such a stupid gimmick? 

Let me tell you how to book: 

If today's date is July 29, then you can only receive slots up until September 27 (only allowed to book 60 days in advance). Stake out the site; as soon as 12am strikes, refresh your browser and you shall see new time slots. Make sure you decide on a time first i.e. 6pm & have your credit card ready--they go like hotcakes. Think of it as bidding. 

Service: Exemplary!  Choice of complimentary distilled or sparkling water offered and even a choice in the colour of your napkin; white or light blue. Server was always there ready and waiting to fill our glasses; never had to ask for anything. They even made an effort to pull out your chair to sit down; so charming.

The tasting menu we opted for costed $105 per person (no wine pairing which would had been an additional $75)--I was happy they were able to accommodate my pescatarian diet and emailed me to ensure they've covered all my dietary restrictions.

Each plate of food was presented in a beautiful and exquisite way.

====Menu====

[Very good] Hamachi Canapé: Bite-sized which clean and natural flavours

[Ok] Sturgeon Caviar Puff: It was tasty, but the puff was an empty shell of air. 

[Good] Foie Gras Champagne Jelly: Light champagne flavours and nutty foie gras flavour combined. 

[Meh] Brown butter radish: Bland and less impressive than other items. That being said, it still doesn't take away from the experience.

[REALLY GOOD] Truffle Gougère: At least we think it was truffle...not sure since it wasn't on our menu list. But wowzers!! It was so tasty. At first bite, the filling was warm and just oozes into your mouth. Loved it!

[Ok] Toro, Coconut Chili: The cool coconut was refreshing with the toro. Taste was a bit bland, but the natural flavours were really noticeable. 

[Good] Baby White Shrimp, Sturgeon Caviar, Cherry Tomatoes: Came out in a dainty bowl with an exquisite spoon made of shell. Again, all natural flavours from each seafood melded with the tomatoes. Tasty indeed.

[SOOO GOOD] Hokkaido Sea Urchin, Corn, Yellow Plum: This was soooo good! The chilled corn purée on top complemented the sea urchin so well. 

[LIKE FALLING IN LOVE] Medai, Sudachi, Myoga, Ice Plants: No salt on the Medai fish aka Bluenose Sea Bass so you can savour it in its freshest form along with citric notes of sudachi  on your tastebuds. Didn't find that the ice plants nor the black crunchy herbs had any flavour, but it gave the dish some nice texture

[Too salty] Pain au lait topped with a bit of seasalt and house-made churned butter: Bun was too buttery and even saltier eaten with the chanterelles potato.

[Good] Agnolotti, Beaufort Cheese, Australian Black Truffle & Brown Butter Sauce: Delicious with cheese oozing out at each bite from the agnolotti. Not sure why, but really couldn't taste the truffle even though it was on top. The addition of croutons gave it some nice texture.

[THE BEST!] King Ora Salmon, Buttermilk, Meyer Kosho, Cincinatti Radish: Best dish of the evening! Salmon poached just right. Flesh was cooked just right

[Delicious meat option] Steak, Shitake Mushrooms, Umeboshi, Ponzu Jus: Steak was about 36mm in size. Friend described it as tender & not over-seasoned. 

[Pretty good] Ocean Trout, Shitake Mushrooms, Umeboshi, Ponzu: Crispy pan-fried trout in a bed of delicious buttery sauce. Flesh peeled off and cooked just right.

[Ok] Cucumber Champagne de Juniper (Pre-dessert): Never heard of pre-dessert in my life, but it was the size of a chinese ceramic spoon and very refreshing. Can be consumed in 1 bite.

[Meh] Strawberry, Chamomile, Orange Blossom: It was good where the whipped cream and cake was not overly sweet. The red strawberry decorations were just ok--nothing too special.

[Ok] Toasted Cocoa, Hazelnuts & icecream: Nothing much to say other than it was good, and the icecream was extra creamy.

Note that the card terminals does not allow you to calculate tip before tax which is quite perplexing because it means you are being taxed for your tip. Paid around $140/person for the whole meal without alcohol which is very expensive but you get the quality you pay for.

I've tried it once--liked it, but probably wouldn't come back again anytime soon.
