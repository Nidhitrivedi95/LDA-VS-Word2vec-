HojKatUfX4UHWaPqtl63NQ We had reservations at 9pm. We checked in and 3 other couples were waiting to also get seated. At 9:10 we were seated. We received water and menus right away, but no one visited our table again until 9:45. The waiter apologized, but it was disappointing. The service never got better. The food was excellent, but hard to give it more than 3 stars since the service overshadowed the food.
