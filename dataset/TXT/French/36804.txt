iEsNloJgy-MyA-_wqeB6jg This classic french restaurant is a jewel in the desert.  An unexpected pleasure located in Cave Creek, amongst the eclectic mix of country and rock n' roll bars.  

The Oysters Rockefeller were delicious, the Chateaubriand with Hollandaise sauce was lean, tender and flavorful, and the Grand Marnier Souffle is always decadent and cooked to perfection.

The decor is very dated, but this is to me what gives the place so much charm.  It's a little bit of France, in the desert.  There is nothing pretencious about this place.  

Love it!  It was a great place to enjoy my last meal of 2010.
