O3OH5IEFMPtz7mPKakPZ3Q Amazing!  I felt like I was back in Japan again.  The scallops are so buttery and fresh.  Lamb chops were delicious.  Black cod, salmon ceviche, baby octopus,  everything was mind blowing.  I just moved here from san diego and I am so excited that there is a place of this caliber so close to where I live now in Vegas that is open late at night even.  I will definitely be back again and again and again!
