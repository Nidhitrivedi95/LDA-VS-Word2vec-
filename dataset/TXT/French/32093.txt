gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA Amazing food.  Great drinks.  Top notch service.  Incredible view.

For the four of us with two appetizers, two cheese plates, four entrees, one dessert, and six cocktails, the price was pretty steep--$590 with tip.

Not exactly inexpensive, but for a special occasion, not terrible.

I'll be back for sure.  I'd love to try the tasting menu.
