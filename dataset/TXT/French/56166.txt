rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I have been dying to go to the French Laundry in Napa Valley, but since you need to make reservation a few months ahead, I don't have the patience to plan for such a dining trip.  So, I settled for their casual offering at Venetian in Las Vegas.  

When I visited them last month, I was expecting something great from Thomas Keller.  I was pleased with the food, but I was a bit disappointed with the waitress that we had (reason to receive 4 stars instead of 5).  The timing for the different courses were completely off.  The appetizer came before they opened our bottle of wine.  And the entree came before I finished our appetizer.  However, the quality of food made up for the lack of proper service.  

The dish that is memorable is the smoke salmon appetizer.  They serve it in a tight-sealed jar with croutons.  While opening our wine, the sommelier made a great suggestion to use mustard with the dish.  If interested, see the picture that I posted.  By the way, their bread, as simple as it is, is one of the best.

One side advantage is that you can enjoy Thomas Keller's food at a knock-off price.
