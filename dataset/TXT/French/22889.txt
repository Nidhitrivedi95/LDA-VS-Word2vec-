It was crowded on this Sunday morning, and that was reflected in the very slow service. The food was good -- I had the steak and eggs with coffee.  The steak was delicious; the coffee too strong. My friend had another breakfast which she said was good.  

I'll definitely eat here again on another trip to Charlotte, but will hope for better service.
