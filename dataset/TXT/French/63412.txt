SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA While visiting some friends in Cleveland, we went for lunch at L'Albatros after some time with the kids at the Cleveland Botanical Garden nearby.  It was a strange, but cool layout and decor.  The open kitchen is front and center when you walk in the front door, with a minimalist, contemporary decorating scheme in the several small dining rooms.  The lunch menu was very appealing, with a variety of open faced sandwiches, pizzas, salads and a large number of entrees.  I started with an arugula salad and the smoked salmon tartin.  Both were very good.  Everyone seemed very pleased with their choices as well.  My friend's burger, even when viewed from across the table, looked excellent.  I even had a bite of the white pizza our daughter had and it was very good.  Now, it probably wasn't the best place to bring our two-year old, but they stuck is in a back corner and we were fine.  I liked L'Albatros a lot and would go back for dinner if visiting Cleveland again.
