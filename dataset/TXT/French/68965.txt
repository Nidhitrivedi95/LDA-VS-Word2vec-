VwZhwflLnTq19aAeFLJHCQ Amazing food and nice lunch menu. Breads are great so panini croque is very tasty!! Professional waitstaff and atmosphere. But they need to hire bussers for their lunch rush. It's unfair to have two waitresses that are serving and clearing off tables. 

Will definitely come back for lunch and possibly for dinner or Sunday brunch.
