5BAdubSKMARs3qYRHGaClA Awesome spot for brunch! It feels like you are really in vacation. Two of us got the lobster poutine which unfortunately had super undercooked potatoes and only a few tiny pieces of lobster. The ambiance and drinks made up for it though! It would be a great place for a brunch date
