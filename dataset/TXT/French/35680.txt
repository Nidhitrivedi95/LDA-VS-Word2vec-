htQgj-ANQpZGpIpkkrEmyQ I'm no stranger to Inspire; service was great, waitress was attentive and friendly even though we came five minutes before last call for lunch. 

I got the Korean burger which was decent but their lunch menu doesn't quite do justice for their dinner menu. 

Meat was tender, great. Only thing I wasn't too pleased about was that the meat was a little too raw for me in the middle. Would've liked it better if the waitress asked me about my preference but no big deal.

Fries were great as usual and luckily we didn't have a line up like they usually do for dinner.
