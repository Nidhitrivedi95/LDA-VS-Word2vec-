LjOBNcNNpuewBqSPxYYTJQ Not the same feel as the NODA one but a great fix for my beloved chai tea lattes. The inside decor seems so forced its almost cheesy. I know you can't do much in a mini mall space, but I feel like the character is lost. Isn't that half the reason we go to Amelie's? The baked goods are OK but honestly? My macaroon was lifeless, bland and way too cold. Hubs hazelnut tarte was also lacking in satisfaction. And then the girl at the register tells me a lot of their stuff comes in outsourced, frozen and packaged! NOOOOO!!! Sad days. 
And do note, this one is only open til 9! Suburbs Amelie's I'm glad you're here and all but it's just not the same!
