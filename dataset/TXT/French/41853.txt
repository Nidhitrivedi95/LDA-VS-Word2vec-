KRgTdfs4oVFUcATMfAoR4A I've been to Vertige 3 times over the last 1.5 years and have loved the food every time. The prices are good and the service is very attentive. The first time, we came for tartarefest in 2016; I had the salmon tartare and Alex had the beef tartare - both were very good. We also ended up ordering mains; I got a pasta dish and Alex got a meat dish - both were very good. 

The second time we came for lobster mania or something in the summer of 2016, where we got two small portions of lobster risotto which was amazing. Again, we ended up ordering mains; I got a pasta dish and Alex got a meat dish - and both were very good. 

The latest time we've been here was August 2017, as I won their Instagram contest of a 6 course meal. Although I did not LOVE everything, it wasn't because the food wasn't good, its just because certain things I didn't like much (like the foie gras, that's not my cup of tea). I really enjoyed the grilled shirmp risotto, the cod fish, the duck and the salmon tartare. We also ordered drinks which were excellent (amaretto sour and kir fragoli).
