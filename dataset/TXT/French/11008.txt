4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw One of my favorite places to eat outside on the  strip. Perfect and romantic. Took my girlfriend for Valentine's Day dinner, she loved it! It was her first visit and she was impressed by the service (Jeremy's a great waiter! Very kind and attentive) the food speaks for itself! Delicious.
