4cWrtMvfj-tomyEPgP7KFg Half bottle wine wednesdays! Went with a friend and we decided to get the weekly special- $33 for the cheese and chocolate combo. Chose two types of cheese (spinach artichoke and Wisconsin cheddar) and two types of choc (creme brûlée and original). All the orders were delicious and the server kept asking us if we wanted more bread and desserts to dip it in.

Super friendly staff and not crowded on a Wednesday dinner!
