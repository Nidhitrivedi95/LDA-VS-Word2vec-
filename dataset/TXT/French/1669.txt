Well, when my sandwich arrived I just knew it would not be good.  Don't get me wrong---it is presented quite nicely, but it was obvious that the bread was all wrong.  And, indeed, upon taste, the bread was just awful.  I expected much better from a french pastry-type shop. 

The pastries looked (in size) like those you'd find in france.  But, if you know french pastries well, you can look at them and again tell it wasn't quite right.  Taste-wise, however, they were fine.  I've had much better---but I'd eat these again. 

Its a bit difficult to find.  Its on the north side of the street, in the strip mall with the huge grocery store.
