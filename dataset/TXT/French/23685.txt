cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg Visiting from Melbourne Australia and great friend Julie and Derek said this restaurant is a must to finish off the trip on the last night. The purine was excellent but the duck in a can was a brilliant dish of different flavours, textures and thoroughly delightful. I have friend travelling to Montreal early 2015 and they have been told that it is not negotiable that they dine at the wonderful restaurant.
