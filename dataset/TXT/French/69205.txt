w2tr0PA0b3tg8pId0kjM-A I stopped by here this past Saturday afternoon with my fiance for a light snack.  This was actually the second time that we had been here although the first time was close to closing time right after they had opened so there was not much to see or buy.  This time around though, man were the display cases decorated with some beautiful food.  Everything about this place feels warm and inviting including the workers who seem to want to help you.  On my recent visit here I ended up ordering an Almond Croissant without really looking at the price.  So you can imagine my surprise whenever it cost me $5.50!  Granted I am more than happy to pay for really good food whenever it necessary and while this was good food, it wasn't great food.  The croissant did have a nice flaky texture to it and a good buttery taste with the outside  covered in sliced almonds. However,I would have been much happier going to another Pittsburgh's French bakeries and getting a superior almond croissant for half the price.  The previous time that I was here my fiance and I got 3 macaroons to split.  While I do not remember the flavors, I do remember enjoying them even if they did cost us a little bit each (I think around $2).  So why the 3 star review for food I clearly enjoyed you ask?  Well it certainly isn't for the interior of the shop which was awesome, nor is it for the customer service which I have found to be great on both occasions.  It is strictly based upon the prices and the fact that I can get what I think is a superior item for much cheaper at a couple of places that are not that far away.

The bottom line for me is that I might be back in the future but only if I am in the Squirrel Hill area and really craving something from a French bakery.
