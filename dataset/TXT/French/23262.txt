C3PVq7UpeHd6nz1_e-AtkA I've come here twice for 2 anniversary brunches and my bf and I love it. A bit expensive but pretty much well worth the price. Their freshly squeezed orange juice is so fresh and delicious. Their breakfast is a very decently sized portion and will fill you up quick. Service is very sweet. Homey and warm atmosphere. I'm a fan!
