htQgj-ANQpZGpIpkkrEmyQ Been here a few times now, each time it gets better and better. 

Despite only being open for a short while, the chef's clearly have a passion for their clientele and their product. The menu is consistently being tweaked and just seems to get better each time. 

Last I attended we were a party of 7, a good chance to try a few apps without getting too bloated for the entrees.

Apps:
- Ahi Tuna Poke - great item to share, cool presentation
- Duck Confit Tacos
- Pulled Pork Fries - a favorite of the table

Entrees:
- Inspire burger (added the pulled pork fries; this stuff is like crack)
- Udon Carbonera (Another favorite of the table, so good it should be illegal) 
- Chicken & Waffles 
- Malaysian Beef Curry w/ coconut rice

The food was absolutely sublime and the service was excellent. The decor was charming, both rustic and homely at the same time; the rough end cuts that make up the wall near the window are particularily charming, and the handtowels in the bathroom are a nice touch. Seems more like a place I would find in midtown or downtown, not on the east end near the suburbs. 

Give this place a try, even if its a bit of the drive for you; totally worth it!
