pYg_w6Qj4vRTAX8Qbz3PHA This is my second visit and likely my last. I was so disappointed in the food quality and service. I treated a friend to the table d'hote and was horrified that she received a burnt  puck of beef after waiting an unreasonable amount of time. The fact the server did not even acknowledge the poor quality/presentation and never asked if we enjoyed the meal, reflects the nonchalance attitude of this place. I am a firm  believer that a sever is the representative of the food and the establishment. And when they don't take ownership of the experience, there's no reason to go back.
