vg55SAkrEmuHpWfIMtJjBQ In my opinion, this is one of the top five restaurants in Pittsburgh. Not only is the food delicious, but the atmosphere is laid-back and the waitstaff are extremely friendly and not pretentious. The last time I went here I even wore shorts and flip-flops and didn't feel out of place, and they were very accommodating towards the four-month-old baby who was with our group. 

I've been here twice for wonderful three hour-long dinners with appetizers, entrées, wine, dessert, and dessert wine. Highly recommended; although it's not cheap, you will feel like you got your money's worth.
