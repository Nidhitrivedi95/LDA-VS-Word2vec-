zw4Legbcu018p5WcZ74iWA My first time in Montreal and trying poutine was a must. After much research on my fav foodie site, Yelp of course, Patati Patata was in my crosshairs. 

Now, I am biased, I needed to find a veggie friendly poutine. I was with locals and they were a bit skeptical of this variation. 

However, the fries, gravy, and cheese curds were delicious and just left you wanting more! The saltiness of the fries and richness of the gravy balanced out nicely with the mild tasting cheese curds. 

The place is absolutely tiny, so if you can't get a table, order to go. There is a nice little park across the street and you can dine al fresco if it's not too icy cold. 

Thanks Patati for my first taste of your native specialty, poutine!
