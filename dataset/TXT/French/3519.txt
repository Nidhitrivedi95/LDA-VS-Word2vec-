1LELXxqe2IM2opJbi4dcaA Great selection of sandwiches, delicious chicken and steak options: the Philly chicken, the Camembert, the majestic (Philly steak), and they were all great. The grilled chicken poutine was very good too. Four stars for the great food and low prices, but only because we got takeout. The restaurant is nice enough, but I'd say maybe three stars if you're eating in. Staff were very friendly and helpful.
