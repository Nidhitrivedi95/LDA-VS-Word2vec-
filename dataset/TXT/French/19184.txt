The tasting menu is a perfect blend, very unique and artistic both visually and in taste.
All of the unique dishes had a lot of delightfully surprising components. Perfect and
Beautiful blend! Who would have ever thought a tomato sorbet would ever go so well
with a cheese based dessert...Lastly,but definitely not least, the service was beyond amazing.
