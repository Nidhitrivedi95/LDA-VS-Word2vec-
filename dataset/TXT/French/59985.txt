sARavfidmIS878q5BtlyVQ Amazing experience! 

Food: creative that stimulates your senses. Difficult to describe as the picture does no justice. Seasonal menu. Foodie world techniques in preparation. 

Ambiance- located in Boulevard Tower, 3rd floor in Jaleo restaurant. Private 9 seat bar in back,  very intimate. 

Service- 4 chefs, 2 servers and support staff. Can't complain about ratio to customer to service. They request you arrive 15 min early, seat you a bit after 8:30 then 2 hour food service/ show starts. Chefs are friendly and answers all our questions. 

Value- slightly more expensive/on par with other tasting menus around the world. My 4 star is for this reason, for the price, no drinks yet, timing could have been a little longer. They send you home with menu, though lacking details, which what I would have liked. Would be nice if they sent you home with a little consumable memorabilia as other restaurants do. 

Recommend: if you can afford to splurge and love food, YES!
