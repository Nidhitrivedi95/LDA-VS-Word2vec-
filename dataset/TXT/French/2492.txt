0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g The food is good but not great. Nice presentation. Just the right amount of food. Service was excellent. Amazing views of the Bellagio water show if you get a window table.

We opted to try both menus.

PRIX-FIXE:
- Poached oysters: Nice and creamy. 
- Filet of Sea Bass: Probably my favorite dish of the night. Great flavor and cooked perfectly.
- Roasted Pigeon: I thought this would come out tasting like quail but was pleasantly surprised by how tender the meat was. 

DEGUSTATION:
- Maine Lobster Salad: It was good but nothing wow'd me about it. I prefer crab over lobster.
- Pan Seared Boat Scallop: Nothing special about this
- Seared Foie Gras: It's foie gras, how can you go wrong with this? Standard seared foie gras dish.
- Colorado Lamb: Too gamey for me. In fact, I've never had lamb served anywhere this gamey. 

DESSERT:
- Hazelnut Jaconde: I was expecting more of a hazelnut flavor but it was more of a rich chocolate. Pretty large dessert portion. Still good but we couldn't finish it.
- Earl Grey Cheesecake: Cheesecake was good but the sherbet was amazing! 

All in all, a nice variety of dishes. With a bottle of their cheapest sparkling wine (~$40), a ~$350 dinner with tip for two. Was it worth it the price? Not really.
