ZdaZwXC0FByDY3EwNELphw Best food I have had in a long time! The menu is creative and different, a must try!
A friend and I went for a late lunch, I started with a Caesar and although there was not much garnish the drink was delicious. We shared 3 plates, the elk sliders were delicious, highly recommended! The pickled pickerel was very well done, cooked perfectly and tasty. We also had the crab and pork belly *tartain* I think? Anyways it was SOO GOOD! The mushrooms, huge pieces of REAL crab! But it didn't stop there, the dessert, we had the sticky ginger cake, basically a sticky toffee, it was to die for, my friend said it was the best dessert she ever had, not too sweet or gingery, we will definitely be going back. Keep it up Union!
