4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Wow do not let the fancy and whimsical Parisian decor fool you. We were on a nice family trip for Christmas. We were seated outside since it was a nice day out. Once seated, my mother who was directly under the heat lamps was burning up to the point of discomfort and suffocation. When we requested our waiter to turn it down, he kept brushing us off mumbling he would see what he can do about it. Several minutes later we called out for another waiter and told him of the heat problem. He was frank and explained you can't turn down the heat unless you're going to turn them all down, as they're connected to 1 central switch. Immediately after, we caught our waiter watching us make the 2nd complaint. He was clearly unhappy that we made a 2nd complaint because he turned around and started snickering and talking to coworkers about us. We asked to sit at next empty table, to which he complied but sighed in exasperation. He did not even try to hide his annoyance!

The food came and everything was deep fried in tons of grease. We had waffles, eggs Benedict, and omelettes, and hashbrowns. Everything was deep fried so much so that every single 1 of us got sick after, with stomach ache, nausea, etc. 

Lastly, when the check arrived we saw that 18% group gratuity was already added. The extra 5th person in our group was my 4 yr old who did not order anything. We walked straight to who looked like an assistant Mgr and she took off the gratuity without any questions. While she was doing it, our rude waiter was hovering over her shoulder throwing up his hands and again, not even trying to hide his absolute dislike for us. 

The male server's name is Efrain. He was an absolute nightmare to be around. Maybe the stress and tension of it all was the kicker to all of our stomach aches.
