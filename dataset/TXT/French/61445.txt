SJo_IjvzdRtCvZVN0cbrRQ I'll often wait a few days after eating somewhere before I get to writing the review, but I feel it is my personal responsibility to tell you about Blue Door as quickly as possible.  If you went to another restaurant instead due to not reading the review I should have written, I just couldn't live with the guilt knowing that I was responsible for you missing out on the brunch of a lifetime! 

Quaint cozy restaurant, extremely hard working, friendly, knowledgeable staff, hip indie music, and most importantly THE VERY BEST BRUNCH AND FRENCH PASTRIES I'VE EVER HAD!  Sinfully fresh hot chocolate filled flaky croissants and hot crispy scones that taste and feel like they're being teleported to you directly from France.  Me and 3 friends all got different specials, and each was perfectly prepared, gourmet combinations, fresh ingredients, and incredibly delicious.  I'm sure you'll be thrilled with anything that comes out of their kitchen, but all their fresh baked breads completely blew us away.  If you were leaning towards a sandwich anyway, head to Blue Door, start your atkins diet next week instead, and your mouth will thank you!
