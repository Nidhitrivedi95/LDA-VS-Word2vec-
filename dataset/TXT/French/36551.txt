i5vxtyiHKYnRcJ0p9N7mLw I love a good Italian deli. The quality of the meats, the flavorful cheeses... oh man. Carlo and Emilie's was perfect. House made bread was a perfect edition. Great sandwich, incredibly friendly service and a great atmosphere. The house made potato chips were THE BOMB. I loved it. I will be a regular.
