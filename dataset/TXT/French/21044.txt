B_0VW7Pw26YiQyDRuutIGQ Poor service. If you're here in Montreal as a tourist and have things to do avoid. Average food and ridiculous wait times. If you are a big group, that's another reason to avoid since the waitress wouldn't care about service since tips is automatically included in the bill. Not sure if it's Montreal culture, but very poor service
