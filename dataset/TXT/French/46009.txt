mVZoin0a8uTZgLsgJ9iNDQ Wow....wow......have to say hands down one of the best meals I have eaten in Edinburgh.

The decor as a point 1 is incredible, rustic French barn come wine cellar look that immedietely makes you think you might be on holiday.

The wine list is also very strong, we had a very refreshing pinot grigio. Yes I know I should of had red but my dining partner (mum Mum) only likes white and we were sharing a bottle.

Onto the food, to kick us off 6 oysters BOOM! I am already a very happy birthday boy.

Jenny.L made a great point a few weeks ago that you dont see foie gras on enough menus. Well it takes pride of place here, set along side slices of rare pigeon breast and poached quince. The foie gras sits on a slice of brioche which just adds to all the flavour. An absoloutely stunning starter. Mum has the goats cheese which again was lovely, often goats cheese is quite heavy but this was light and full of flavour. The bread we were served when we arrived came in handy for plate clearing :D

Onto the mains and there was only one option for me, Saddle of Perthshire Venison, Celeriac puree, Beetroot & Carrot. The deer was rare as advised by the waiter and just so damn tender. There was also a hidden suprise on the plate, a ball of braised deer cheek was wrapped in a few kale leaves. I though it was a sprout at first and then cut into it to find this unbeleivable meaty suprise!!! My hat to the chef 3 times over!!! Witha  stunning reduction and all sorts of other flavours going on around the plate the taste was just superb!!

We were too full for derert but ordered coffees which came with a dark cocoa caramel! Home made of course and delicious.

Cant recommend this place highly enough and I will be back very soon as soon as I can get a girl to agree to go on a date with me :p!!

Jd = Happy man!!!!

P.s. actually scrap that last point I want to go back soon :)
