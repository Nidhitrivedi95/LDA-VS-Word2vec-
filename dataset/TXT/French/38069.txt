JEXasd9XUHFbt_fIdmdK8g La Banane is one of my favourite restaurants in Toronto. The food is innovative and French inspired. The atmosphere has a Manhattan / hipster feel. 

To start, we had the plump mussels marinated in an espelette pepper vinaigrette. We also ordered oysters and scallops from the raw bar. 

For the mains, we had a stunning European sea bass en croute and the duck breast.  The sea bass is a must when you visit La Banane. It is first presented at the table fully enclosed in a pastry.  It was the centre piece of our meal. The rich flavours of the yuzu beurre monte combined with the taste of the fresh sea bass was outstanding. I would highly recommend ordering this dish when you are at La Banane. 

If Michelin was to rate the restaurants in Toronto, La Banane would definitely be Michelin worthy.
