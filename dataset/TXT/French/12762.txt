4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I am not an authority on French cuisine, but  I certainly enjoy the food here.  I have been here for dinner and lunch.  My parents and other people that I know that have been here all rave about this place and I agree that it is warranted.

Update:  I recommended to one of my co-workers (bona fide French!) and she fully approved of the place.  I steered her away from the buffet (boofet!).

The service sometimes leaves a bit to be desired.  I think that it is nice to sit outside when the weather is nice, but the service seems worse out there.  Inside and for dinner, the service seems better.

As someone who is tired of most of the casino restaurants, I can't say that I ever tire of this place.  I feel like a lot of the casinos have now taken for granted that after dropping a couple of g's at the tables, customers will not mind paying $45 for a buffet dinner that is a bit so-so... Wynn, I'm looking at you!

So if you REALLY want to eat somewhere on the Strip and you pass on my two places in my other reviews La Scala and Ichiza, then this place will deliver.  Also, you can make reservations here via OpenTable.com.
