rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A This is the second time I've been, the first for brunch with the family and recently for an early Valentine's dinner.  Had reservations for Feb 13 on a Monday at 8:30. Was running late and bumped it to 9pm. Bad mistake. Got there at 8:45 and sat at the bar for 45 minutes before being sat of our 9pm. Forgot Magic (the garment convention and not the "poof it's a bunny" magic) was in town.

Started with the Seafood platter at the bar.  The oysters were great, the rest was good too (I mean, how can you ruin steamed seafood?).

I ordered the leg of lamb over beans and the gf ordered the Eye of the Rib since they did not offer filet mignon and the only other steak option was a pan fried steak.

The bread was PHENOMENAL! Of course, it's Bouchon!

The lamb was a little bland and the best part of the dish was actually the beans (and I hate beans usually).

The steak, ordered medium rare, had to be returned as it was cooked through. Not a good sign at a "nicer" restaurant, so we ordered it rare. A steakhouse should really know how to cook their steak.

Long story short: it was just alright.  And for the price tag, I was expecting more than alright.  As I remembered the brunch, it was only alright also. So in the end, Bouchon gets a 3 star, alright rating.
