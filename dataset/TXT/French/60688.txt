SCklYa_jhihWAcfIn-_chg I  this place. It smells amazing firstly. We waited an hour in line in the freezing cold and it was worth it. The smell kept us going. Its what I imagine Paris smells like...coffee and baked bread. 

I had a Benny...very very good. They made a classic perfectly. My husband had the bacon sandwich on a baguette...surprisingly good. Simple but well executed. 

But their fruit tarts take the cake. They were amazing. I wanna take them to every party i go to. Nothing but good things to say about brunch here. (Get the latte bowl, hehe so cool)
