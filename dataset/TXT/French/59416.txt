rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w Oh, Le Cirque, you disappointed me. Our perfect anniversary dinner was ruined by your incompetent staff:
   1.Hostess who didn't ask for my phone number or if we were celebrating a special occasion when I made a reservation (so I had to tell her before she hung up)
   2. Snobby server who, for some reason, neglected us the whole night. What did we do to deserve that?!
   3. Whoever is responsible for my entree come out 45 min after I was done with my apps.
   4. Manager who, after listening to me, said I should have waived him down earlier to resolve the issues with the entrees and our server! Whaaaat?
    You guys have those five diamonds hanging on the wall, I shouldn't have to waive anyone down. Besides, i find it extremely rude. So we had $20 of our $400 bill taken care of. Please don't bother next time...Wait,there won't be next time! 
   By the way, make sure your servers know your menu because that Kobe filet is probably 4oz, not 8oz as I was told.
    A good thing I can say about that place is that the sommelier and food runner were amazing, both professional, funny and very attentive. They are the only reason I'm adding a star.
   Overall, how would you describe your experience when a very special dinner goes to hell and it still makes you really upset/angry/frustrated two months later?!
