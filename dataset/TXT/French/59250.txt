rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w I would have to agree with most of the reviews here! 

One of the best dining experiences in Vegas! I have been to Craftsteak, L'Atelier, Mesa Grill,  Nobhill, and N9NE but Le Cirque outshone them all with their wonderful service and great food. 

I felt it was a bit stuffy but our group was lively so we made the restaurant work around our mood. :) 

The best part was the fantasy desserts for my friends birthday. The chocolate souffle is a MUST!!!!

Definitely go and you will not be disappointed! :) 

Also, they give the ladies a tiny jewelry case and put truffles in it. the coconut one is super delish!
