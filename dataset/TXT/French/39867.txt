We'd heard about Razz's for awhile and always wanted to find a 'special' time to go -- the first time ended up being spur of the moment and what an amazing experience!  The food, first and foremost is fantastic and so unique.  The service is amazing, the decor and ambiance cannot be beat.  But to have the Chef himself entertaining and discussing the food is just over the top!  What a wonderful find!
