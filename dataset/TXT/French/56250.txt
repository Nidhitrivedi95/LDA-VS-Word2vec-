rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A On a recent CES visit, I was able to procure a reservation for 4 at 10 pm on a Friday night.  Great!  I have cooked with Bouchon and various Thomas Keller Sous Vide cookbooks and was looking forward to this.  I had ordered seared Foie gras and Coquille St. Jacques.  The Foie Gras must have been seared in a clear vegetable oil and was bland.  The Coquille St. Jacques?  It must have come from a starvation diet recipe.  Two 1.5 ounces of scallops, and I am being generous on my estimation, on a small bed of sauerkraut for $29.00. It wasn't enough even for an appetizer.  The sauce, and it was a just a sauce, was bland and uninteresting too.  It neither tasted of cheese base or an hint of Pernod or wine.  
My friends had Leg of Lamb stew with white beans.  I am sure that the leg of lamb was cooked separately by the sous vide method and the beans were stewed separately.  There was not a hint of jus from the leg of lamb in the white beans, and the beans were undercooked.  Needless to say, my friends were not impressed.  I was embarrassed for suggesting the Bouchon Bistro to my friends. On an average evening, anyone with some culinary skill could cook better.  Very disappointed.
