6Hj4AQ5DDGf7tsVk6LscLQ FIRST, I just have to say: Really, previous reviewer? Three stars based on a single drink that you, in fact, seemed to enjoy? Did you knock two stars off simply because the restaurant it used to be is gone? Harsh.

We were planning to go to (too cool for) School for brunch, but the line was insane, so we moseyed over to 25 Liberty. SO GLAD we did. The space looks a bit fancy pants for my taste, but lovely nonetheless. Really nice bathrooms. (I hate it when restaurants skimp on/don't clean their washrooms.) The prices are on par with anything else in Liberty Village, and pretty much the same as at School.

Here's the skinny:
Coffee: very good and waaaay better than School (Sorry to keep dissing School, but I also hate when brunch places have bad coffee. Make an effort, people!)
Eggs with caramelized onions, garlicky spinach and Brie: so delicious; creamy, garlicky, fluffy...pretty much perfect
Herbed potatoes: Fingerlings! No boring russet chunks here. Herby and not overly salty.
Salad: I am usually underwhelmed by salad with my breakfast at anyplace that isn't French, but this was fantastic. A mix of interesting greens and tasty dressing.
Toasts: Unexpectedly, the egg dishes came with grilled, herbed toasts. Extra delicious.
Double-smoked bacon: As good as it sounds. Thick and not fatty or greasy.
Beef, ham and Sriracha sausage: my husband loved it -- a bit TOO meaty and salty for me, but that's why I didn't order it and he did

Zero pretension, super friendly staff, huge light-filled space, with no crowds and no wait. Can't wait to go back and try more.

**UPDATE: Removed a star. Went here again last weekend and it wasn't quite as impressive. The salad was a boring romaine lettuce instead of mixed field greens. Portions were smaller.  Fruit salad was much smaller and less variety. Gravlax was bland and potato rosti was tiny. Cutting back on quality?
