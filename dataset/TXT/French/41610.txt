kKC7UTcHZM3zLfT97x3msg Found this gem in Little Italy a few months back. The place was very homey and elegant; especially with the antique architecture, wooden floors, and the candles. Our waiter for the evening was especially delightful, even though we automatically assumed his name was Frank (which was quite embarrassing). This is one of the places to splurge once in a while for lavish food and a lovely ambience, ideal for an evening date. We were first served a bread basket, and my favourite was the one with the pate. Even the butter had a salty richness that I've never tasted with any other. My most to least favourite dishes:

Elk Loin Wrapped in Truffles with Chestnut Agnolotti & Foie Gras Jus ~$24 - the elk loin was succulent and was served with a candy-glazed cherry, a dumpling, and a piece of foie gras (my absolute faveeee).

Escargot Bourguignon with Braised Oxtail and Manchego Foam ~$18 - this was a memorable way of serving escargots. each piece would be taken with a piece of oxtail where there'd be a battle between soft and dense chewiness. the manchego foam tastes like cream and was an interesting take on molecular gastronomy.

Crisp Gnocchi with Pancetta in a Gorgonzola Cream Sauce ~$18 - the gnocchi was made crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside. I've never tried gorgonzola cream sauce (blue cheese) before but it was almost like a mix of salted alfredo and chilli spices. it was most definitely a memorable dish.

Between the making of our dishes, our waiter served us an amuse-bouche where he poured some parsnip cream into a tiny dish of pears. If only it was in soup format I'd get more! And to add onto that, he served us with hand-made truffles on a cold slab when the bill came in. The chocolate was so decadently filled with what seemed like a denser version of the inside of a lindt chocolate.
