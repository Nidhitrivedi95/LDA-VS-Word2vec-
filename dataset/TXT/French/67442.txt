UWupVhvb1qWZh8rNowJliQ Came here for a networking session and dinner, not really knowing what to expect.

I cannot say enough good things about the service here. I was helped with my coat and bag as soon as I got here, and handed a glass of wine (always a good thing in my books). During dinner, drinks were constantly flowing, and the servers left us to our conversations but were always helpful if we needed anything.

For food, I decided on the Ontario Green Salad for my starter, the mushroom risotto for my main, and the Woods Smores dessert. The dressing for the salad was an ice wine vinaigrette, very Canadian and very creative. The risotto was pretty good (although I would have ordered the cordon bleu if I had read other Yelp reviews haha), but I have to give a shout out to the S'mores dessert, which was truly a chocolate-lover's dream. Although I thought it would have been more authentic to its name if it had more of a fire-roasted taste, I definitely enjoyed it thoroughly.

Thanks Woods for the great first visit, I will be saving up my money to be back!
