cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg I had always heard Au Pied was one of the best restaurants in the city, but had never gotten around to going. This spring I brought a buddy and his visiting bachelor party  and we were all blown away. Highlights include: George St. Pierre sighting, pork grinds starter, pork chop the size of my head, pulled pork french toast sandwich, and a frois grois poutine that brought down the house. Go there.
