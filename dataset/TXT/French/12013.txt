4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw This place had really good reviews and the weather was beautiful Saturday morning so I wanted to eat somewhere outside. The outside dining area looked really nice so we decided on this place which is actually at the Paris hotel. We arrived at 10:30am, breakfast was ending at 11am, and the wait  for the patio was about 45 minutes. The seating inside was right away so we had no choice but to sit inside to catch breakfast. I was really pissed about it, especially because we got seated in some back corner behind other tables, practically behind some drapes. But the food was really good, a little expensive but hey, it is Las Vegas. The server was great and I hope to come back, but wake up early enough to get patio seating!
