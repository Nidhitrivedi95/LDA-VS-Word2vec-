A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g HELLO, is it me you're looking for?  Well that is what the fresh baked bread and pain de chocolat were saying to me, YES THEY DID I heard them.  So of course I had to take them home with me.

Before I left the bakery I did venture back to the deli and oops we had an early dinner.  Ordered the escargot (YUM), the croque madame  OMG freaking FREAKING delicious, close very close to the ones I had in France and hubby put together a prosciutto panini, also excellent.  Extra bonus points for having Orangina.

The pastries and bread we had later at home which were also fabulous and reminiscent of the ones I would buy in Paris and mostly like the ones in Angers.  The macarons are TO DIE FOR and at the best price point I have seen in a very long time.  And people these are not easy to make, it takes a real artist to make them that deliciouso.

Do not let the surrounding mall area confuse you, this place is worth going into.

FYI - foie gras was in the HOUSE
