ZIQrmmK86wQXVowgLsjW5A Fantastic meal and excellent service. I was excited to try a Michelin star restaurant overseas. They were so nice even though we came in sopping wet from the rain!  That would've been frowned upon at similar restaurants back home so we fully appreciated the kindness! Fav dishes were the smoked salmon, soup, halibut, cheese...so, mostly the entire meal. Went back a couple days later when they were closed to snap a pic outside.... and met Paul Kitching!  But we were so dumbfounded when he introduced himself we must have come off as idiots. Totally kicking ourselves we didn't think to ask for a pic with him. Ah well...
