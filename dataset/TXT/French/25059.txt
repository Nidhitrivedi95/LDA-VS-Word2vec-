Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA MIX is worth a visit to THE Hotel for the view alone.  Even if you don't want to dine, go for a cocktail and photo-op.  FABULOUS.

The food is somewhat expensive, but no more than any other nice place in Vegas.  We've been there twice for dinner, and recently for a corporate event with passed apps.  I don't remember what we had for dinner, but it was very tasty.  The passed apps were pretty standard--goat cheese on crackers, ceviche, sesame beef cubes--but served hot, fresh, and yummy.
