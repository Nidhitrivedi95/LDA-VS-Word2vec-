m9aFZk1f8tSv248YErbpQA Went to lunch with daughter-in-law and loved everything about this intimate French brasseire/café. My dil had a veggie crepe and I had a spinach/bacon quiche that was fantastic. I loved the crème brulee dessert and forget what my dil had for dessert but she loved it. I tried to practice some French pronunciation of menu items the night before to impress the dil but I failed. Attentive, friendly staff and a great alternative to the big box breakfast/lunch places.
