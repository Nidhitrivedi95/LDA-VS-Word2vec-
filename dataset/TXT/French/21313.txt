I was visiting Phoenix for a weekend, and found this restaurant on Yelp. This cozy and unpretentious french restaurant lives up to everything reviewed.

The escargot and Soupe à l'onion were great starters. The Porc Roti (pork chop) with roasted butternut squash was juicy and delicious. Unfortunately, they were out of the soufflé, but the chocolate crème brulée and port poached pear were both yummy desserts. Yes...I ate a lot, and I wanted more.

Our waiter was very friendly, and had some great recommendations. The only bad part of the night was that we made reservations for 9:15, and was not seated until 9:45. However, the restaurant was very accommodating, and we actually wanted to return the next morning for brunch. If not for our flight, we would've come back for more.

I would fly to Phoenix and drive to Scottsdale just to eat here again.
