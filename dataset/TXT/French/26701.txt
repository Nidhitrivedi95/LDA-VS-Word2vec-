Da6eZFThE9xanUAGNpZxAg Atmosphere is great. Small and imitate place. Seats around 40 people? Lol don't quote me.  Food is quality !!!!!! Great meats and cheese. We've tried everything on the menu and love it! Every dish is done to perfection. No frills just tasty ingredients!We come back again and again. The boards are better that terroni 100%. The meats and cheese are from local and aboard. Desserts are sweet and simple. Literally cannot wait to go back!
