bRmb81XDG3E2SOHARBLTog My boyfriend and I were looking for a nice Sunday dinner.  We stumbled along Bodega as we made our way down Baldwin.  From the outside it looks very fancy but we were greeted warmly and the light, fun music set the tone for our delicious dinner.  The prix fix menu was well worth the $35, the food was delicious, beautifully presented and the service was impressive.
I would definitely go back.
