I took my time savoring every bite of this. It was absolutely amazing. The atmosphere was very relaxed, yet "high end". It was Titanic Night, so the specialty dishes were inspired by those served on the Titanic. All the while, the Titanic movie was playing in the background. A very romantic and memorable experience. Rhonda and the rest of the staff provided excellent service. I cannot wait to go back.
