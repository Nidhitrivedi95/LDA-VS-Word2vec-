fVF5wayDyY6ZR5oJB1IK3g I wasn't sure about going here for Dinner as all anyone can rave about is the brunch.  But I'm here to tell you that you need to go for dinner as well.  First of all, trust the Somm.  Just tell her what you've enjoyed in the past and she'll have some great recommendations, thick the lovely bottle of Alicante we shared. 

The day we went they had a corn soup with clams and other lovely bits that was rich and yummy.  Highly recommended.  We followed that up with the pork tongue, which everyone should try.  Actually I suggest that they not tell anyone what it is so that people not familiar with tongue can enjoy it first and then find out that this forgotten part of the animal is so good.  Tender, flavorful and served with wilted sorrel.  A true delight and something I want to have again.  And finally we ended up with the mackerel.  Which was nicely cooked and had a great flavor.  It was served with Kolrahbi, which I've usually had as a puree, so nice pieces that were cooked properly was something new which I enjoyed.  All in all dinner was yummy, satisfying and fun.  But of course by the time you go, the menu will probably be different but if you have only come from Brunch, please come for dinner.  You'll be happy.
