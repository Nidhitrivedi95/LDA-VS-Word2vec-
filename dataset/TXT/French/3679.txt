27vF5LESbv4kFQfHZUDCnw People mistify me! Why would anyone give this scrumptious empire of deliciousness anything but a perfect score? From the daily scone (and the dirty one on weekends!) to the chouquettes, the bread from Thouet and each one of the most exquisite petit fours,  every item baked or sold here is absolute perfection!! Come and prove me wrong! I live two blocks over and only superhuman restraint prevents me from buying something every day. Free WiFi, good, friendly service and small details such as iced water complete the gestalt. Highly recommended!! The coffee is good too.
