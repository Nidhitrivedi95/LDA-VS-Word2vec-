vg55SAkrEmuHpWfIMtJjBQ Contrary to what its name would lead you to believe, Legume is not vegetarian friendly at all. It is an upscale pseudo-farm-to-table kind of place, with a nice drink selection but typically 1 vegetarian option on the menu any given day. I've had to eat here for work events on several occasions, and it's always easy to choose what I'm going to order (haha)

That said, the veg food I have eaten here had been solid. Not insanely good, but definitely well-thought out.
