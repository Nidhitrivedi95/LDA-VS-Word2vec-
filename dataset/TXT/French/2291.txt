0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g Picasso was incredible.  The atmosphere which included artwork by Picasso and views of the Bellagio fountains, the service which was exquisite and the food which was full of flavor and creativity made this a very memorable dinner.  The staff at Picasso really understand how to provide great service and they delivered on all of our questions and requests during dinner.

We ordered the 5 course tasting menu which included a lobster salad (fresh lobster with a light yet flavorful dressing), scallop in a potato puree (the scallop melted in your mouth), fois gras (served with a brilliant sauce that brought out the flavor of the fois gras), lamb chop (perfectly cooked and seasoned with vegetables and a light sauce), and dessert where we had the chocolate lava cake and the peanut butter mousse.  All courses were reasonable in size and at the conclusion of each made you anxious for the next course.

The wine list was robust but not overwhelming.  We ordered a bottle of 2007 Cabernet which was silky smooth and complimented our meal.  We took the sommolier's  advice for port pairings with our dessert.  We ordered two different ports and they actually gave us a taste of each other's port so we could drink and taste the differences.

We would highly recommend a visit to Picasso.  It was the total experience in a relaxed yet scenic setting at the Bellagio hotel.
