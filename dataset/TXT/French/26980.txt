Dcj69NZJnbJhK-YHP_nULA O.m.g.  The burger I had here served on ciabatta bread was one of the best burgers I've ever had in any city.  The pommes frites are amazingly delicious too.  Top notch rotating beer selection.  I usually write longer reviews, but the only thing that really needs saying is GO HERE NOW!!!!
