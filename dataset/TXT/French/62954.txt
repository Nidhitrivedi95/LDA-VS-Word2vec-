SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA Went here for my husband's birthday with another friend on a Sunday evening.  Made a reservation a week in advance with no issues (you can't reserve seating outside but reservation is highly encouraged).  Here's the breakdown:

Ambiance: 5 stars, if you are eating outside.  Bar next door had live music that you could hear from the restaurant patio and it was awesome.

Staff:  4 stars: friendly and knowledgable staff, a lot of people on hand to help.  Laid back.  Some staff were 5 stars but some of the help were more like a 3, and overall I get annoyed when too many different people are visiting the table.

Appetizers: 5 stars.  Must get the French toast.  I would potentially go here again just for appetizers.

Drinks: 3 stars, bad incident with a cocktail that was ordered (orange peel was dirty, hair in drink, sugar at bottom that wasn't properly mixed into drink).  Wine selection and taste was excellent though.

Dinner: 3.5 stars - ok the taste was 4.5 stars but for the insanely high price of each dish, everything should have been perfect.  Medium rare steak order was more like medium.

Dessert: 3 stars.  I love dessert, like my favorite part of a special meal, and it was just OK.  A lot of people come here to celebrate so they do the whole candle thing which is nice.
