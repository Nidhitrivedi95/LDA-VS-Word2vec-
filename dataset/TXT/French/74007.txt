xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g The whole package is a four.  The views, service and ambience is a 5 and the food is a 3.  We had a magical view overlooking the Bellagio fountains with the pretty--if Disneyesque--architecture of the Italian style buildings around the Bellagio lake.  In fact, even the restaurant itself felt like a Disneyworld restaurant.

I'm not sure this would be my restaurant of choice (given the expense) if I were taking my wife.  I would take her to an equally expensive but more gastronomic choice in Vegas.  But, given that I had my 13 year old daughter, the choice couldn't have been better.

The food is pretty good but you can tell this isn't a chef of supreme talent.  My daughter's halibut was excellent.  My veal was a little tough and a tad over-cooked.  In other words, the food is perfectly fine but don't expect Eric Ripert from Le Bernardin or Thomas Keller from the French Laundry.  I wouldn't even put the food in a category of Mortons or Ruth Chris.  It's a half a step below these.  But, the view, the fun of riding the elevator and the overall experience made this a wonderful evening with my daughter who has raved about the restaurant.

Here's what to expect for price (assuming appetizer, main and dessert) per person:

$75 food
$50 wine
$10 tax
$25 tip

$150/per person
