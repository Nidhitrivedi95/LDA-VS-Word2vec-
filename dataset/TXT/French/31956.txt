gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA Though located off the strip, Alizé was definitely my favorite fine dining experience during my most recent Vegas Trip during Christmas of 2014. After reviewing so many Michelin-star restaurants in Las Vegas, I decided Alizé has the most appealing tasting menu; and boy, was I glad I made that decision!! 

BF and I came here on 12/24/14 for our Christmas eve/Anniversary dinner, and the staffs couldn't had been more helpful and fun. We were promptly seated upon arrival (unlike Le Cirque.... over 45 minutes of wait, with reservation!!) Alizé even had a "happy anniversary" card along with a secret key await us on our table, which was located on the edge of the restaurant and oversee a very nice and romantic evening view.

Here's what we had ordered from the their tasting menu:
-Russian Golden Ostera Caviar & Truffle Caviar (an additional $20 supplement:) we particularly enjoyed the salmon gravlax and the truffle gelée.
-Hamachi Tartare & Smoked Fish Trio: BF got the honor of eating the fish trio, and to my surprise, he enjoyed them all (he's a finicky, non-fish eater...)
-Sautéed Foie Gras & Foie Gras Terrine: Oh, the sautéed foie gras had to be the most decadent dish of this whole meal. The creaminess paired with the sweet potato purée, plus the apple chutney, then smeared on top of the brioche... my mouth is watering again as I'm typing this review!
-Steamed Salmon & Pumpkin Gnocchi: what I really enjoyed about the Salmon dish is the unique sauce that was poured over it.
-Duck Breast & Wild Mushroom Risotto: I ordinary hate eating animal skin since it grosses me out, but for some reason I didn't mind the skin that came with the duck breast. 
-Rack of Lamb & Veal Wellington: these two are the main features of this tasting experience. Veal wellington was extremely tender and juicy, the truffle jus most certainly complimented the veal nicely. oh, and the rack of lamb, it was served boneless!! 

******** We never got to finished the rest of the meal since my BF was a bit under the weather during the entire meal, I told the staffs we will call it an early night. To which not only they gracefully obliged, they also had the cheese plates boxed for me. And since they cannot get the desserts to go for us, they included a variety of macaroons for me to take back to the hotel.****************

-Tête De Moine & Robiola
-Toasted Spice Marshmallow & Grand Marnier Soufflé

Honestly, for a 7-course tasting menu, $135 per person was actually a very good deal. And if you can make it an even better meal, make sure to order their wine pairing, which cost an additional $95 per person. Though a bit under the weather, my BF and I really enjoyed the services, wines, and most certainly the food. Unlike any other fine dining restaurants, the staffs were unpretentious, and genuinely friendly. They even started to joke with us toward the end of the meal. We had a fabulous time!!

Oh, and the secret key that was offered to us in the beginning of the meal? It opened up a very cute little box which contained a pastry for us to take home. It was a very sweet and lovely gesture. We will definitely come back the next time we visit Vegas, and I am confident anyone that visits this restaurant would enjoy it as much as I did!!
