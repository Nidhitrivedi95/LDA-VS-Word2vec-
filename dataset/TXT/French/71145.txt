xcmmTXhuMx2fZF2Bt69F4w Curried Carrot soup for an appetizer, delicious, a little too spicy for me, but others at my table loved it.  The Frites (fries) are amazing, they come with an herb mayo dipping sauce which makes them so so tasty.  I split the mediterranean platter (olive hummus, some kind of wal nut dip, fresh veggies with cheese sprinkles over top), there was so much food we ended up eating it for a couple days.  Everything was so fresh and delicious, would highly reccomend!
