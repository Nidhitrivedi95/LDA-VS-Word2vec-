JsAjP49bCk9KjJmmmjyM4w Imagine an Oreo and a croissant got married, had a baby, and went on a family vacation to Mexico where they stayed out in the sun too long, got toasted, and dried out. That was my Crookie. Read: dry and stale.

I was really looking forward to enjoying a nice, fresh, sweet afternoon treat - imagine, a croissant stuffed with Oreos! But, no. We visited around 1:00 PM on a weekday afternoon a few months ago, and ordered one Crookie to share. Thank goodness we only purchased one. It was really, really stale, dried out, and tasted like it had been sitting out for a good, long while. Disappointing. 

I hear their almond croissants are worth a try, but after my first experience, I'm not sure I'll be back. In any event, if you do check this place out, go in the morning - in the earlier hours, you'll probably have better luck grabbing a fresher pastry than I did. Two stars - for novelty, I guess.
