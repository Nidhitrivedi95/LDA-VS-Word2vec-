C6PKcZuC3KJDf0PouOPsGg Honestly the food was the best I have ever eaten in st-sauveur. The menu goes from simple to very well crafted masterpieces...tartars and meats are to die for!!! The place is beautiful and the music was perfect. Once the lights go down and the dj starts playing, Marabou becomes a different type of beast! Best place north of Montreal by far!!!
