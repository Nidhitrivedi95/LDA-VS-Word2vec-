AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw My hunnybunny and I dined here for weekend brunch during our stay-cation in April 2014 and we were not displeased.  After eyeing this eatery for months, we have finally gotten the chance to experience what Payard was all about.   We didn't take advantage of the to-go bakery, but opted for the dine-in experience.  

It was a busy Saturday morning for Payard, but service was quick and efficient.  there were several parties ahead of us; the foyer was small and we found ourselves among casino traffic and noticed on-lookers stopping by to check the establishment out. 
...Good marketing tactic...or poor design..?  That's for you to decide. ;)
Once seated, we were promptly greeted and our drink orders were taken.  I started off with a grapefruit mimosa.  YUM. 
The restaurant was small compared to other in-house casino eateries, but I enjoyed my time spent there.  It was small and intimate and I felt like I wasn't in Vegas, the land of big and shiny things. 
I am a self-proclaimed French toast fan.  Can you guess what I ordered?  Yes, indeed.  
Doughy and cakey, each bite of my beloved pain perdu was a taste of sweet, sweet indulgence.  My tummy was happy.  
The service was prompt and unobtrusive, which I totally appreciated!  
We haven't had the chance to try their famed almond croissant.  We will check that out on our next visit.  Stay tuned!
