hzyvL2v97xLzLbLXcdi1uw I've actually wanted to go to brunch here for a long time, and I don't have any excuses as to why I didn't earlier- seeing as I live right down the street.  I actually didn't like the venue very much, as it seemed to be more favorable for a coffee shop rather than a restaurant.  Located in the bowels of a Walnut side street, it was small and quaint- which unfortunately doesn't bode well for the brunch crowd.  It was way too crowded, and I ended up sitting right by the door that people kept opening and shutting and it was unbearably cold.  The food was average to above average for brunch, and the service was so-so.  I was a bit disappointed with my experience but would consider stopping in again.
