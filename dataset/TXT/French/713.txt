_cjPEH9wXhKS-HQe_U3M4Q What a great find in the city! Friendly service and kick-ass French food. Best part? A kids menu which creative choices like duck leg and lamb chops.  Kids loved it.  French onion soup is so rich.  And cassoulet is fresh and original.  Cannot find a fault here.  And prices are quite reasonable for food too.  Love this place.
