yIBeZebnXb-hvexqknnDCg I need to start this by saying this all happened on a day they were supposed to be closed!  I spoke with the manager of the restaurant and explained that there was only one night that my party and I could have dinner due to our work schedule.  After whittling downtime the guest list down to 13, the chef and manager come up with an amazing array of courses.  Add a very knowledgeable sommelier and a detail oriented waitstaff and dining bliss was had by all!  Each course, every pairing was meticulously explained and prepared to perfection. During courses we were given the history of the building as well as a tour.  The only issue we had was that the evening couldn't last forever.  Cliché, sure.  But also very accurate.  

I thoroughly enjoyed my visit to the McNinch House Restaurant!
