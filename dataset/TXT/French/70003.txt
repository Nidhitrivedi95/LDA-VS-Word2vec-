wsbYymWUVBsry9yxeLZc6Q A quiet small place for dinner on Laurier Est. It's tapas style but with less than 10 options on the menu. So I tell myself don't dare paying over $9 for a simple carrot soup when you're 3min walk from home :P . The food was great but maybe not interesting enough for the price & location (fierce competition in this area). Brunch seems to be more reasonable so may be I will give it another try.
