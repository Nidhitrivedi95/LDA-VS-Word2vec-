Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA Lets start this review with the AMAZING views of the strip, there are several tables you can sit at and marvel at the twinkling lights of the strip, and bonus seats right at the outside of the bar to sippy sip your cocktails at. 
And, If you do happen to  visit this great find, def, def, DEF seek out the bathrooms located at the end of the bar area. They are pretty damn dark but how awesome is it when you sit on the toilet and find yourself  facing the outside of the of the hotel (ie full length glass wall) you could possibly sit on the toilet for days just looking out over Las Vegas if it werent for the perma lines youd get on your derieree!
hmmm....
what? Oh yeah, the food. :-)
-Tell me,,, what restaurant starts you out with a bread basket full of 5 different types of bread and serves not ONLY butter but crunchy peanut butter spread to go along WITH your bread???!!! SOO Good!
-Bigeye tuna tartare !!! YUMMMMMMM, even with the potato chips that come along for the added crunchy-nessss....
-Lobster ceasar salad (dressing on the side) was sooo good. Im not usually a fan of ceasar salad, but anything with HUGE chunks of lobster, will make my palate do summersaults!!
-Mac 'n chesse with ham (HELLO) southern delight! The perfect blend of cheese,cream, and crunchy toppings!
-LAST but NOT certainly least..........ta da CHOCOLATE SOUFFLE with pistachio ice cream. More likely than not, I will usually go with a creme brulee, but who can resist a warm, crunchy chocolate on top, gooey rich, velvety yummness on the inside spectacular of a dessert!!!! OHH MMYYY GGAAWWDDD!!!
