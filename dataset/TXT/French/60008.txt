       Chef José Andrés can do no wrong here. Stunning, elegant and handcrafted cuisine. No doubt if Michelin returns to Vegas next year, E will easily earn a star if not two!

      To get in, know some chefs, high roller, or if you are lucky enough, you can score 1 of the 16 seatings per evening. Price, 1/3 of Joel Robuchon, and you know this is much well worth it! Think of 20 courses feast, single bite (as Alinea or Avenues Chicago). Try for yourself!

     If I'm lucky enough, I get to come back before the year end!
