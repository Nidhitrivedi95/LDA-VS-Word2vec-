uP3H5bcsiTXM0k0xQhRndg Very unassuming little family-run place in Old Montréal. We almost walked right past it without realizing it, and very glad we didn't!

The food here is some of the best we've had in Montréal, and the service was so friendly and accommodating, in both French and English. It was obvious that the people there were there because they enjoy running a restaurant and creating a great experience for diners, and they did so very successfully!

The Mac and Cheese dish was an amazing and flavourful new take on an old classic, and everyone at our table had to have some. The highest praise from our party was reserved for the "Ultimate Experience" dish, which was an aptly named pork belly served with some miraculous sauces. So amazing, and so sad when the plate was finally empty!

We'll be back on our next trip to Montréal, without question.
