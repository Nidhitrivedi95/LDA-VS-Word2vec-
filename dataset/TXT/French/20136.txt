aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw Wow.  My gf is a sucker for bakeries so I decided to go here with the group.  It was pretty damn hard to find (maybe I'm just retarded).  We walked all around the Venetian to find it.  But man, it was so worth the search.

We were strapped on time so I quickly ordered what was recommended on Yelp... the macaroons.  Holy hell, I am not a huge pastry/sweets fan but this was amazing.  My two favorites were the spiced pumpkin as well as the vanilla.  But were bomb.  Pistachio was good as well.  The strawberry was disappointing -- but it may have just been lost in the glory of the pumpkin!

I'll definitely be returning.  Six macaroons for $17 is pretty hefty, but so worth it.  Give it a try.
