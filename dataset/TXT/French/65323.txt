u-SvRRAfYgpbXZRfQgcTzA My favorite Izakaya in town. Sake bomb is a must try. Noodles are good if you are hungry. My friends and I weren't very hungry so we just ordered some appetizer: takowasa, edamame, goat cheese and fried burdock. Loved all of them! I also loved the atmosphere here. Everyone was shouting sake bomb. Everyone seemed so happy. I was so happy :)
