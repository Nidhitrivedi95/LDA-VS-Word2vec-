lcTa0q9Wo4wNyLCIgWFRUA Great place and conveniently in the Loews Hotel which is awesome especially if you're staying here ;) we had dinner at the bar and the staff is simply perfection: friendly, accommodating and warm without being pushy or hovering ever, so we were able to enjoy talking and eating and the company. The $1 oysters (I think Tuesday and Friday's only) are fantastic and the veggie pasta was rich and creamy and filling unlike most vegetarian pastas I've come across. Definitely comfort food after a long day of travel and a cold night in. The duck confit was Devine. We are happy to have this place in the hotel for the duration of our stay.
