4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Amazing food & Service! Well worth the wait for an outside Patio seat! We went for a romantic but reasonable "date" night and were not disappointed! Next trip I want to go back for lunch so I can get the Pate. My husband had the Steak with Green Peppercorn sauce and it melted in my mouth. My fish was juicy and flavorful. You must eat here!
