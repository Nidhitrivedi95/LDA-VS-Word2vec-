5fquJHY2hMX9tPRD5s0t5g We were 2 couples in Charlotte for the weekend to attend a Panthers game. Roosters was close to our hotel and we were able to book through Open Table for the time we desired. The food was delicious, the server Gavin was attentive and offered pleasing suggestions. He hit a home run with the wine he suggested! Roosters is pricey, but we all agreed it was a wonderful evening. We were even reminiscing the following day.
As my dinner I had the Fried Oyster appetizer and a side of Roasted Beets. There were about 10 briny oysters with a small cup of cocktail sauce. The cocktail sauce wasn't needed because the oysters were so good. In fact our friends placed an order to add to their dinner once they tasted mine. My husband enjoyed the Housemade Pasta with Mixed Seafood in a buttery seafood broth with a hint of tomato. He loved it. In addition to their oyster add-on, our friends had the 1/4 roasted chicken, a dinner salad, and side of Macaroni and Cheese. The salad was so-so but the chicken was reported to be juicy and flavorful. Sides are offered a la carte to be shared family style. Although we ordered beets and macaroni & cheese as the only sides, they were sizable enough that we didn't finish them but wished we had been able to since they were delicious.
