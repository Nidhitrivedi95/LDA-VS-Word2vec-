XI3iNUgChOfJk5ppjKVEQQ Came to town on business with a couple of associates, and while I'm very familiar with Catherine Street over many visits, this was my first walk through Old Town. We just happened to stumble upon this place. Service was fantastic, waitress was lovely, the decor is old school. The menu is small, but we all had something different and everybody was thrilled. My buddy Al had the osso buco and said it was the best. The salmon I had presented well and tasted amazing. 
It gets a little crowded in there, but it was still relatively quiet. Good wine selection. I wish I had been able to convince my wife to come along on this trip, as she would have loved this place. Definitely a return destination.
