jT-KFrbwr5iE-_vrVLpmiw It is definitely a great place for brunch and afternoon tea. The interior decoration is simple and clean, but the sandwiches and desserts are both good in tasting and looking. I have been to Beiruti for several times, usually on weekends. Every time I went there I got nice service. Its dessert menu sometimes will be refreshed seasonally, which is great for someone who cares about freshness. But there is not much seats or dining space inside. Although we could sit on the patio, I would not say it has a romantic dining environment with good view. Overall, I like this place, and will be back often.
