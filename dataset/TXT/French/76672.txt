Yp9w4nhUowBU_IS_StFXbQ This place was awesome! We came a little later than 1:30 and the place was pretty empty...but I saw such great reviews on Yelp so we had to try it! The orange juice was freshly squeezed and was the best I've ever had! Honest! I ordered the traditional eggs benedict and the husband ordered the white chocolate & orange French toast. Both were REALLY good! We also ordered beignets for dessert and they were also pretty tasty! We wanted to order the chocolate and cookie soufflé but THEY NO LONGER OFFER it! I guess I will never be as lucky as my fellow yelpers who were able to have it :( I also ordered tea after my lunch and our bill was about $100 - so it's pricey but well worth the food. Service was decent, not the best but the food made up for it! I think this place will be a must for every trip to Vegas going forward....
