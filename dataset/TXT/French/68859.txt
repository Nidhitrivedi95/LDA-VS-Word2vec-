VSPft3RUXDE8HnX6Anvbvg My wife and I visited DNA several weeks ago and had an early sitting at the 'Kitchen Table' on a Saturday night. I can't say enough great things about the experience and the food, we both loved it. 

We made the reservations about 6 weeks ahead via email and it went smoothly and they were very accommodating. They confirmed the day prior and were ready for us when we arrived. The entire staff was great -friendly, engaging, helpful and quick with drinks and anything else we needed. 

The kitchen table is downstairs alone right by the kitchen. My wife was a little hesitant at first as we aren't the most adventurous eaters, but after 14 courses its safe to say everything was delicious. We just did the tasting menu and Chef Derek continued to bring us plates of food one after another. Some were on the menu, many weren't. With each dish we got an explanation of where it came from and he would answer any of our questions. 

Dishes ranged from seaweed to goat heart tartar to gnocchi to shrimp to goat neck. They were all perfectly proportioned and tasted great. We were there over 3 hours and it was really the perfect meal. Derek was awesome and couldn't have been nicer to us, and the same goes for the rest of the staff. We can't wait to go back to Montreal and experience it all again.
