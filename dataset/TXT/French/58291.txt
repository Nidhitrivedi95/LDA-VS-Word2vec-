rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I was just informed there is now a Bouchon in Beverly Hills, so I may save some money by not having to come out to Vegas every other month to get my fix. I was a skeptic when my friends first hyped up this little bistro sitting in a far corner of the Venetian. I'm a picky eater. Not in the sense of choosing food (I'll eat pretty much anything in front of me AND in front of you), but I am difficult to impress.

My first visit here was for dinner and I got the mussels. I was really expecting a small portion of barely edible shellfish and had plans to stop at the gift shop on the way back to the room and binge on potato chips. No need, no need. There were enough mussels here to feed a small country. Not only was the portion generous, but I got a huge side of fries along with it. Score! I also had my first foie gras experience, and once I got the image of ducks buried in dirt out of my head, I enjoyed that as well. The desserts were to die for...I have a special relationship with creme brulee that must be revisited on scheduled intervals. Bouchon made it happen, and I was not disappointed.

Second visit was for breakfast, and unfortunately it did not live up to either my own hype or the excitement I could feel permeating off the group I was with. My fault for trying a meal that included an ingredient I don't really prefer all that much. It was my mistake, trying to be adventurous. Seems like I'll have more opportunities, now that there is one local to me. Yay!
