mr4FiPaXTWlJ3qGzp4-7Yg Had a very lovely meal here on Saturday. Came at 6:30 and it wasn't busy but filled up by the time we left. The crowd was definitely older, I don't think I saw anyone under 30 in there. Decor was very woodsy and rustic. But at the end of the day, it's the food that counts!
We had...
Hot balls: lamb risotto, mushroom and fontina risotto, and a goat cheese and honey balls. You get three little timbit sized balls for 7 bucks which I thought was very reasonable. They were so delicious, I wished we had gotten the double portion after we were finished.
Polenta w/ Sausage Sugo: My affection for polenta knows no bounds so I loved every little spoonful of this. It came out on a slice of a tree trunk which allowed the polenta to slowly spread out perfectly over the dish. Polenta was creamy and had a nice umami flavour. Good liquid-to-polenta ratio made this comforting and incredibly addictive. Chef came out and laid the hot sausage meat sauce right on top of it. We loved it so much, we made it at home the next day...seriously.
Steak tartare w/ frites and salad: Delish and flavourful tartare. The frites were incredible!! Get them!

Will I be back? Yes! None of the dishes even remotely disappointed me and the service was solid.
