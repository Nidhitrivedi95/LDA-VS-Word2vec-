QeFsIMcIFIJcOrpthYL8jg Came here as it was one of the few places that could accommodate a group of 10 with a kitchen closing time late enough that we could all make it in time for food.

The live music is probably a draw but unfortunately we all came right at the end of them wrapping up. The decor and atmosphere is certainly inviting and I can see how this place can be a tourist trap, ourselves included.

The steak I had was tasty and so was the salmon dish I tasted, but beyond that the general consensus at our table was that the food wasn't anything exceptional.

Service was a tad slow at times, but it was friendly and patient especially when we all tried to figure out how much to throw down for the tab.
