q0n4I-zqiI47xispOqc1lA Sat out back with a large group for a bachelorette party. The brunch food was excellent all around, and since it was our first time there, they gave us a free fruit platter and some pastries. My only minor complaints were that the stem cost was pretty high for the byob mimosas we brought, and while we enjoyed being outside, I don't think it should've been assumed that we wanted to be outside given that it was a chilly day. Again minor complaints, but overall a very good experience and will certainly be returning!
