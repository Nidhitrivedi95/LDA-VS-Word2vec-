hvjgF-vnPw2jyL5DBuB0qg Having been there twice before, and having loved the restaurant ambiance and food, my wife and I were really looking forward to going there for our anniversary.  We started off by trying to make a reservation, I first tried exactly one month in advance using the on-line line system through Open Table and it said that there were no reservations available even though the restaurant website says that reservations will not be taken more than one month in advance.  I tried calling with the same results, how is that possible ?  I wonder if the place wasn't full with "friends".  This seemed to be the case as a waitress was drinking wife with patrons at one of the tables.  Not very professional.  We were given a space at the bar and at the same time put on a wait-list for a table if there were to be a cancellation.  When we arrived on Saturday evening, there were plenty of unfilled tables and during the whole evening while we were there one of the tables was empty.  We inquired, we wanted to move, and were told by the rude employee at the front, that the patrons for that table had called that they would be late.  An hour later they never showed and we were stuck the whole evening at the uncomfortable bar.  After 15 minutes they should have seated us at that table.  Our server said that she would get the manager for us, but he/she never showed.  Where is Chuck?  As for the food, some was good and some wasn't so good.  My wife had as an appetizer the crab on toast, well there wasn't very much crab, in fact there was only two bites worth and the bread was hardly toasted.  Her lobster rizzoto had too much garlic.  My dishes were good but not excellent.  We spent over $200 and for that money we had expected better.
