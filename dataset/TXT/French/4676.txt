2zd-1R3CdnaMDXTAEVa2Qg Passed by for lunch, grabbed a half-chicken dinner:  $10.50.  Comes with rotisserie chicken, rice, potatoes, salad.

Chicken was pretty dry.  Potatoes were cooked thru, but not roasted enough.  They need a little more sear in them, very little flavour.  I skipped on the rice (not sure why someone would put both potatoes as a Dinner plate).  The salad was just taking up space.  Lady piled everything into a styrofoam container.   Chicken layed ontop of the salad LOL.  

But it's a small hole-in-the-wall place and the prices are good.  Dont expect much.
