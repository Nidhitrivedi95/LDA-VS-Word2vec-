O66Zy8Y13VBm72ZDhS4fIg Arrived in town late on a Friday and stumbled into Sassafraz. While the people and service were friendly that is where everything positive to say ends. Foods was just awful. Now I have to say this was the scaled down menu in the lounge area but that really isn't an excuse. Lobster bites and Ricotta dishes were awful! I wish I had something more positive to say...guess the only positive is I know I won't be back?
