Ht-_i0UAq7YDBaqJwcQMdQ A real treat. Excellent food, excellent atmosphere, excellent service, and an excellent wine list. What else could you ask for?

I highly recommend this Old Montreal Gem. When you're in town whether for business or a romantic evening make sure to try and get a reservation at Chasse Et Peche.
