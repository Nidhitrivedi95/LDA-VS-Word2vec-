kcF-en40P3J9L8nLy5lKqQ I've been looking forward to this opening since Zen 32 closed. They did a great job on the build out and the bar area is fantastic!  Very modern and I love how open and bright it is...perfect for this time of the year.  I have been there twice now and have been impressed.  The Arancini was delicious as well the chicken wings. I will definitely return!!
