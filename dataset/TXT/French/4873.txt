33Tr0eRki1Yamzleu4GMdw I would like to leave a review, this time in English. I've been coming to this cafe regularly and the quality of the food is always excellent. Everything that I've tried (and I tried almost everythibg) is very fresh and tasteful. They have a conference room that is very concenient for business meeting with good healthy food and great coffee. Now they even have a nice patio. The owner is very nice, always smiling and willing to make us feel good at his cafe. Thank you Jonathan, we need more business owners like you!!
