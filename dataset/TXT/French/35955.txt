hvjgF-vnPw2jyL5DBuB0qg Ate here last night and had a mixed experience. 
Atmosphere and service is good. 
Dishes are hit and miss:

Seafood platter of oysters & cold smoked salmon: great
Beet salad w/ apple, dill and buttermilk dressing: very nice
Lobster poutine: very salty and not much lobster (19$)
Beef cheek gnocchi: too salty, greasy and some odd Asian flavors mixed in  (the biggest looser of the night.) 
Venison served rare: delicious.
