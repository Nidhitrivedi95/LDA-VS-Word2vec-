ljv3iah4xC1mVZMrOStOYQ I can't definitely say this would be a second visit back! It was pretty dead only for the sake of it being Monday and a holiday. Entering, we were greeted in a courser manner , very friendly and made it comfortable for us. He even played a couple good songs to vibe to! At one point he even gave us a round on him and a second because of how much great vibes we brought to the bar. Shots after shots, Long Island after Long Island, MONTREAL and this bar was great! I appreciate such personality and culture they bring amongst a diverse place. I amongst my friends  will definitely be coming back! Never underestimate a place with low or high volume, because the service and kindness can always bring you a great experience to live for.
