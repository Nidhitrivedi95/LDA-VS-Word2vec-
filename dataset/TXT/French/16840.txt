8xCiibfgqy-8xpCWEaguqg Went there for a business dinner, everything was good. I heard they have another one in old Montreal, weather was too cold, so we decided to come to this new location, I like the layout/design of this place.

I ordered Fliet. it came out exactly what I want. everyone else's order looks good.  the drinks were great as well. 

I would come back if I'm come back to Montreal again for sure
