If I could afford it, I'd eat here all the time. Not only is the food delicious, inventive and conceptually interesting (there's something I never thought I'd say until I was served pig's ear), on two separate instances, I've had unforgettably phenomenal service here.

(Rest assured the service was still good the other times)

Lawrence clearly take their food seriously, and their devotion to using fresh produce, sourcing ethically and sustainably, and not wasting offal, are evident. Thankfully, they are not in the least preachy about any of these things, and you won't be subjected to a side order of self-congratulation if all you care about is a good meal. Their ever evolving menu is posted daily to their Twitter account.

As far as brunch goes, expect variety, freshness, and a few things you may not have heard of before. Everything will be explained in as much detail as you would like. The space (literally) shines in the earlier hours, with large windows, a well thought out interior and vintage china giving your eyes as much to feast on as your tastebuds.

Dinner is a similar affair, but based around a selection of heavier mains. Of course, you could skip the main and opt for small plates, but you would be depriving yourself of some incredible dishes that border on comfort food.

Despite no ambitions of "being a bar", the drinks here are made extremely well. If you're partial to a cocktail with your meal, you won't be disappointed.

I still haven't been to many of Montreal's "top tier" restaurants (Joe Beef, Au Pied... etc), but I'd be comfortable placing Lawrence in that category. Definitely worth it.
