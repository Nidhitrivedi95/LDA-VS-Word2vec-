4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw GREAT food.

My mom loved the Filet Mignon, the merlot sauce on top was sublime 

I had the Salmon, Kale, and Spinach salad, which was cooked perfectly but a little too lemony for me - but still enjoyable when you eat it with the avocado on the plate.

Only one star off because my cousin got her food overcooked, had to wait a while to get it redone. 
The staff were super nice and accomodating about it though.

Nice location, outdoor seating with shade isn't too hot either so that was a plus. Personally I'd have stayed indoors anyways - more because I prefer the cold to heat, but my mom wanted out so, mother won
