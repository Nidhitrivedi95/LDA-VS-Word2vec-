8xCiibfgqy-8xpCWEaguqg LOVED this steakhouse. The food and atmosphere were both excellent. I came on a Friday night and the restaurant was busy, as expected. We were told the wait was 30 minutes for a table for 2 in the main dining area, but the bar dining area was first come, first served. As luck would have it, a couple was getting up in the bar dining area just as we arrived, and the waiters quickly cleared their table for us. I ordered the white wine sangria and my friend ordered a peach cocktail. Both were sooooo delicious. For my meal, I ordered the Thai chicken, with a side of mashed potatoes. It was fantastic! I'm typically not a meat person, but this chicken was cooked perfectly! I would definitely recommend.
