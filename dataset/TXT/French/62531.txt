SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ Good stuff, Had the smoked salmon and pecan smoked pulled pork sandwich. The salmon was tasty, there online menu says they smoke it in house, but the menu that day didn't say such, but it didn't seem like any store bought stuff I have ever had, really thick and some what juicy, guess I should have just asked, and we could have both have just skipped all that. 

On another note service wasn't that great, but they were in the middle of shift change so take that as you want. 

On a better note the pecan smoked BBQ sandwich was kick-ass, I actually made some BBQ sauce the next day and steeped some pecans in it just see how it would come out since I liked the flavor so much. The potato salad was good besides being a little under seasoned, but to each there own, because you can just add salt to your liking, but I had none on my table and had to go and find some, see previous note. 

They have a good beer selection too. 

So five stars for the food and 3 for the service. 

P.S. my BBQ sauce turned out kick-ass too.
