A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g One of our favorite food places in all of Las Vegas. We come here at least once a week and have not been disappointed once. We took my sister here once and she fell in love with the macaroons. Now we have to bring her back a box every time we come back to So Cal. 
Great food and amazing pastries!
