YicI6Q2bPIEHoOD3iA4-XA What an unsuspecting restaurant! I had never heard of it until its name popped up on the Winterlicious menu. It was a great discovery :)

We made a reservation for dinner on a Friday night. We were greeted right away by the hostess, shown to our table, and our coats were hung. Our waitress, on the other hand, was a little hard to read. Her words sounded like they were pleasant, but the tone of her voice and expression were a little cold. Strange.

Anyway, for appetizer we ordered the Elk Slider and Popcorn Escargot. Slider was nothing to write home about, but the escargot was DELISH. It came in a row of eight little guys, lightly breaded with a light curry sauce over it with some enoki mushrooms. Recommended! For our main, we had the Grilled Iron Steak (amazing) and the Elk Bourguignon. I am such a sucker for bourguignon so I was very excited to try one with elk. It was enjoyable but definitely not your traditional bourguinon. Not so much stew as there was mash. Don't get me wrong, I was not disappointed. Just surprised. Strangely, I do not recall much of our dessert... Of course, by then I had finished a bottle of wine. Forgive me, dessert lovers.

I enjoyed the dining experience and the atmosphere a lot. See you again soon, Jam Jam (I hope).
