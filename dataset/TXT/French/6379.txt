4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw The Country Pate was excellent! Really great. The low stars are for the Steak Frites. Can't trust a French restaurant that can't do a good steak. Easiest dish to nail because you let the cow do most the work. It's like the steak was cooked in too much liquid. No sear and practically boiled. Meh!
