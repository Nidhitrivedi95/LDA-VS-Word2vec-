JezHN-9KKLTMbojq00VP0g Great experience this time around.  I started off with a latte.  I asked for almond milk but unfortunately they didn't have any that day.  Sad :(  Very good latte.  The boy got a mocha and of course he was happy.  Sweet seeker!  I ordered a ham and brie omelet with a side of Lyonnaise potatoes.  Yum diggity.  The boy had the Croque Monsieur with salmon and an egg and potatoes.  He dug it.  Service is a little slow on a Sunday morning.  Get there before 11am or it will be packed.
