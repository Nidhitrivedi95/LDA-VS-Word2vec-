rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A This is some killer french grub, I loved it.  Had a cucumber soup and the trout, amazing front to back side to side. Simple ingredients prepared perfectly.  Pricey but worth it.  The brunch is pretty stellar and classic french.  I would go again, after saving up my money.  Its not cheap. 5 star is rarely cheap!
