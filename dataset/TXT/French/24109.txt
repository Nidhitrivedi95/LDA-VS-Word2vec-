With praise from far and wide, Au Pied de Cochon is one of those rare eateries that truly lives up to every expectation and accolade.  Everything was rich, savory, plentiful, and incredibly flavorful.  After being promptly seated at our reservation time and having our helpful waiter decipher the menu for us, we decided upon three classic dishes: the foie gras poutine, the duck in a can, and the PDC Melting Pot.

First, the foie gras poutine is life changing.  Everything: the sumptuous gravy, the fries, the slightly salty melty cheese, and the richly velvety foie gras, was cooked to perfection and melded together beautifully.  It was unlike any flavor combination I've ever had and I would order it again in a heartbeat.  The duck in a can was also terrific.  Part presentation, part flavor and food, this dish sung on so many levels: juicy duck, foie gras, vegetables, gravy, potatoes, everything.  It was so rich and savory, perfect for a cold winter night.  And the melting pot gave us a taste of all that PDC can do with pork: sausages, belly, and chop, served over mashed potatoes with two large pearl onions.  I couldn't have asked for a heartier, richer, more solidly delicious meal.  And lastly, when we wanted some of their maple toffee sprinkled over a bowl of plain ol' vanilla ice cream, they gladly obliged.  Bonus points for outstanding service!

This is not a meal for the faint of heart, your vegetarian friends, or those looking for a light supper.  This is meal that celebrates meat in all of its glorious forms.  It is a meal that you will remember and talk about for a long time.  In short, a definite must on any visit to Montreal, and well worth the coin.
