While walking around, this place caught our eye. They offer pastries, crepes, gelato, coffee, soups, salads, sandwiches, etc. We dropped by to get some chocolates and they were well prepared. Smooth, not overly sweet, with a nice finish. The cashier was friendly and packed our goodies neatly. This store has one too many tempting treats.

Great place to visit if you're in the mood for dessert.
