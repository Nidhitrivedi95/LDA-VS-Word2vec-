htQgj-ANQpZGpIpkkrEmyQ Decided to come last minute from reading the reviews. 25 minutes away from where we live but well worth the drive. Note: Make reservations on the weekend. I called for a reso while in the car driving there. I got lucky and had the last deuce for 6:15pm spot. 

Ordered the duck confit fries to share as a starter. Perfect quantity to share for two people. I was expecting more bursts of flavor but overall great dish. 

Entrees ordered were udon carbonara and Indonesian
Chicken rendang. Both were packed full of taste and the portions were large so you have some to take home and enjoy the meal a second time. :)

We opted out for the dessert because we were so full. Definitely a place to go back. Since its a bit out of the way we'd go back for a special evening for us or a group of friends.
