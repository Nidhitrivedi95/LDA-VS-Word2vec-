xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g Great Service, AMAZING food and the view of the fountains at Bellagio set the tone for a great dining experience.  I make it a point to visit the Eiffel Tower restaurant on each trip to Vegas and have always had a wonderful experience.  The staff strives to make you feel welcome and are attentive to your needs.  This is a great spot for a romantic dinner for two, but make sure to call ahead and make reservations to ensure you get a good table.
