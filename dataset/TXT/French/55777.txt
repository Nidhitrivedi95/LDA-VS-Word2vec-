rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Just perfect for what it is. Came here for brunch. Lovely service, nice bellini, AMAZING pastry (trust me--the cheese danish is not anything you'd expect a cheese danish to be. I saw it on a neighboring table and had to order it. It's perfection). The brunch entrees were lovely as well. We had the eggs benedict and the maple banana sourdough waffle. Gorgeous restaurant. Would love to come back another time in the afternoon for raw bar and drinks. A bit hard to find in the Venetian (save yourself some time and just ask) but well worth the journey and the odd elevator ride!
