ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug One of the worst experience with delays in any resturaunt I have ever had.

Came in and got seated along with another table of 2 people. They ordered right away and got their food an d paid and left the restaurant. While we (also table of 2) were still waiting for our food.  Approximately 1.5 hours of waiting to receive our food.

The manager did not want to do anything about it.
He said thank you and he will check into it.

I will never come here again nor recommend anyone to unless they will be hungry in several hours.

Wish I could give 0 stars, but the system doesn't allow that.

Adieu
