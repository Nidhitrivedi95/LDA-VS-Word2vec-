MdjIl105vqCYUGKFSUVytA came here for sunday brunch with my bf for his bday and considering the amount of bad reviews on yelp.. i was pretty on the fence about coming here but i still wanted to try it nonetheless.. despite the amount of reviews here that say the service sucks, the service we received was perfect! we were late for our reservation so they had to reasonably give away our table for the next reservation but we were seated quickly within the next ten minutes by a friendly, smiley hostess. our waitress immediately offered us drinks. now to the food, i didn't really care that much about the selection of food except i really wanted lobster and crab lol unfortunately, at first glance, there was no crab or lobster, just shrimp and smoked salmon.. was pretty devastated... BUT! heres the game changer,  i noticed a coleslaw type salad sitting lonely beside the platter of smoked salmon untouched but didn't think too much of it. to my pleasant surprise, upon closer look, it was a LOBSTER salad!! they weren't cheap on the lobster either, it was PACKEDDDDD! that made my day lol nothing feels better than lost and found haha i dont think a lot of people knew it was a lobster salad and i'm guessing they probably put it more to the back deliberately so people wouldn't go HAM on it :P subsequently, we asked our waitress about the crab because we thought maybe that's hidden somewhere as well, too bad they actually didn't have any because apparently there was something wrong with the crab supply? overall, i had a good experience here, my bf loved the food (he ate like 7 plates), ambiance, decor and service. will definitely be back for the on the menu desserts!
