ovtlrcsVRlgZZQUlHs_ovw The main dishes we ordered duck & salmon were excellent but our experience was  marred by the terrible and unprofessional service . The bread came after the meal and the staff was completely unattentive. Service  is better at most fast food places. For the amount the charge I definitely expect better service .
