rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w I absolutely love this place!!! We celebrate my aunt's bday here.  They seated us at a window table, and provided us great food, awesome service, and a wonderful experience.  I picked their 5 courses tasting menu.  There's nothing I could say negatively about this place. Some people would complaint about their price, yet I think with their food quality, it's very much fairly priced. Will come back to try their 10 courses for sure!
