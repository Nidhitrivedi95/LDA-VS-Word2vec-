AHosGBveeXx9YjsQvdJgeg My boyfriend and I went their while he was visiting for a fancy night out on the town and we had a wonderful time. The restaurant is in the large black building in uptown Charlotte. Use the free valet parking as self parking can be troublesome. 

I had the best Filet Mignon!!! Cooked perfectly with this delicious Red Wine Reduction & Béarnaise Mousseline. Everything on the menu looked great! 

The views of course were the best thing about this place!!! Wall to Wall windows over looking the city. If you just want to enjoy the view without having to buy an entire meal their bar offers the same great views!
