0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g I was really excited to try out Chef Julian Serrano's Picasso with my girlfriends this past weekend. We tried the Menu Degustation along with the wine pairing, the pricing wasn't too expensive since we've been to other restaurants that costed a lot more. However, our night was completely ruined by our server, Michael. We sat down and was ignored for about 15-20 minutes. No water, no menu, nothing. 

Finally, we flagged down a busboy and asked him for some water. He looked at us and said "what else did you need?" I was flabbergasted. I said "menu, please?" He looked around for the server and told us, "let me find your server." Once Michael the server finally decided to grace us with his appearance, he looked at us and said "do you know what you want?" No smile, no introduction, and looking a bit irritated. We ordered and continued with our night as if we were not treated like shit. As the night went on, Michael not only did not check up on us, he still continued to stop by our table looking irritated. 

I don't know if he was having a rough night or what, but I know that he ruined the night for us. As for the food, it was decent. Chef Serrano's menu definitely did not disappoint.
