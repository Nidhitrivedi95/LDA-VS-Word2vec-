UxWH8zRYIBgs6Q2oykvRdw We've tried Cluny in the Distillery District twice in the past month - once for the regular menu and once during Winterlicious for the prix fixe. Both meals were excellent.  Finally a really good restaurant in the Distillery District!  From the regular menu we sampled a steak tartare appetizer, the seared tuna steak sandwich main and a hangar steak.  The steak tartare was okay but not great.  Far too much ketchup or some other tomato based sauce for my liking.  Drowned out the flavour of the beef.  The grilled tuna was excellent.  Buttery.  Lightly grilled on the outside but primarily raw.  The best tuna I've had in years.  The hangar steak was perfectly cooked and very flavourful.  For our 2nd visit we began with oysters which were excellent and then had the Winterlicious Prix Fixe.  For appetizers we sampled the lentil & barely soup which was good but not great.  We also sampled the arctic char marinated in blood orange.   It was really a ceviche.  And it was excellent.  For mains we tried the duck confit and it was perfect.  We also tried the limousin beef which was cooked sous vide.  Another hit.  We also tried the grilled albacore tuna with fennel seed crepes.  Another hit.  For dessert we tried the fruit cobbler, the chocolate mousse and the poire william sorbet.  The desserts were good but not on a par with the appetizers or mains.  And not on a par with the excellent pastries and danish which you can buy at Cluny's bakery.  Service was terrific.  The room is gorgeous.  Beautifully decorated.  They've created a very comfortable atmosphere in an enormous former warehouse space.  Wine prices seem to average a 300% mark-up compared to LCBO prices.   Based on our 2 meals at Cluny we will definitely be back.   If you are visiting Toronto, give yourself time to wander through the Distillery District before or after your meal.  If you're going to a play at Soulpepper, Cluny is perfectly situated directly across the lane from the theatre.
