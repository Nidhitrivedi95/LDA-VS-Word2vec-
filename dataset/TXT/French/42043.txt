Kut9tVbDX_f7qKMRRoXg3w Very rustic interior, takes you back to the small bistros in the suburbs of Paris. The staff is very friendly and helpful, and service is always fast. The food is exceedingly well, and the flavor and taste are top notch. Their sandwiches can not be beat in Montreal, the quality of their meats and cheeses as well as their seafood is above anyone else in the area.
