Q67n_plh27S0tlzFE7pM9g I really wanted to like this place. We had been to this location under the past two owners and had better experiences. Unfortunately, there's not much good to say. Menu was very limited which would be ok if the food was exceptional. We were not impressed at all. Everything was very basic, not worth the prices. We were a party of 6 on a Friday night. Made reservations but they weren't ready for us when we arrived. There were only a handful of other tables but service was slow and inaccurate. When our checks finally came, those were wrong too. From start to finish, just a bad experience.
