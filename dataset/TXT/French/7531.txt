4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw First off, food was great.  I ordered the Steak Bordelaise and it was solidly cooked and seasoned.  Had a little bit of everyone else's food and that was good too.  I only had one gripe about this place.  I don't know if it was me or because I had one too many glasses of scotch but is it too dark in there?!?
