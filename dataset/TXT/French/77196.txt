YUFxSG6idHePsxOmnSHtpQ We came here for the first time last night. We like Mimi's but, had never been to this location. Nice parking lot and clean restrooms.
We were seated by a very fun girl who was speaking French with my girlfriend. Don't get her started,hehee.
Anyway we got a nice booth in the back. Our server was very attentive.
The funny thing was he told us his name was Chance and when the Manager was checking on everyone to see if they were good ,he called him Zach. Plus the check said Zach. Oh well everyone should have fun at work I think.
Anyway, our food was good, we got the Fried Zuchcinni. Which is always good at all the locations we have ever tried.  It is very lightly Breaded and comes with really good Marinara sause.
I got the Pot Roast, my Gilrfriend the Salmon. Both were very good, just wxtremly saltly. We were so thristy even into the next day. Food was good, just too much salt for seasoning. Service was good. We will go back for sure.
