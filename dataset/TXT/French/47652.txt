O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q I wish I read the reviews before I went here....

Where to begin...
I ordered a cocktail with a lime - it came to the table - they whisked it out of my hand and handed me another drink - with a lemon.... Okaaayyyy.

I ordered the filet mignon medium rare - it came blood raw... I sent it back - and all they did was re-fire the same piece of meat - which was a subpar piece to begin with.... Having already cut it made it very dry when they served it to me again.  When I pay for a $60 small filet - cooked right and not dry would be nice.  The bernaise was horrible - there was one flake of tarrigon in the cold oniony goo.  And I guess there must be more than one person dining at a table to be served bread - which the people literally sitting right next to me - let me know that it was really good... I guess I'll take their word for it.

So... One cocktail, one glass of house cab, one small filet, one baked potato plain, one serving of bernaise = an even $100.00.

Do not waste your money here. If the food was worth it - even with getting everything wrong with that simple order - maybe... However, the food just is not cooked well.
