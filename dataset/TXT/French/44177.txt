MdjIl105vqCYUGKFSUVytA When it comes to décor, Colette Grand Café is just... grand.  Very Parisian with the only complain is that they're playing ambient music which in many ways ruined the Parisienne feel of the restaurant.

Food price is more than decent with very good quality ingredients and presentation.  Unfortunately all of the food I ordered (including the desserts) are too salty for my taste.  How is a Dark Chocolate Macaron be salty?  That's just plain wrong.  The fried frog legs are extremely tasty but at $21 for four legs it's plain insane.  I expect "expensive" but I didn't expect "insanely expensive".

As for service, everybody was extremely friendly and knowledgeable but having four different staff asking "how's the food" is a tad much for my taste.

Would I go back?  For certain items such as the Sunday's Special pork dish (at $20) yes.  For the $21 frog leg appetizer or the $58 seafood appetizer, definitely not.
