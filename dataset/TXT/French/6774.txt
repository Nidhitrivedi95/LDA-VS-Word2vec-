4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw There really is no better spot on the strip to sit in the mid-day sun...sip cocktails...enjoy lunch and watch the freak show that is the LV strip. I am not talking about the street performers and the local wack jobs but rather the folks from flyover county. It is shocking to see what they pack to wear...and then how they matchy-matchy and accesorize. 

lost my train of thought...Mon Ami is a good choice...yes pricey...but the food is solid...the drinks more than adequate...and the service top notch. They leave you alone as long as you are spending (drinking)...but the minute you think you're going to nurse your drinks...then you are moved to the bar. The patio real estate needs to be turned on a perfect 75 degree day in November.

Romance, business, lost your shirt at the tables, just tired of shopping or talking football spreads and over/unders...its a great place to stop mid-strip.
