SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ My husband and I have been eating at House of Tricks for years on our annual Spring Training trip.   The menu is creative and the food is tasty.  I love the wine list too!  We took some of our clients there for dinner last week and it was perfect - beautiful setting, great service, lovely wine and food everyone loved.  I highly recommend it!
