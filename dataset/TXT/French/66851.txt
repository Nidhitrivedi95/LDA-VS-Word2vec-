UpEVdq_euH-5mqCIgUAd2Q Crepes are one of my favourite foods.  The smell alone gets me excited.  I'll eat them salty, sweet or plain.  

We tried Le Papillon for dinner and I wasn't disappointed.  The restaurant was extremely busy, which meant the service wasn't fantastic, but in the end we were able to get everything we wanted.  My crepe was overflowing with seafood and a rich sauce.  It was very filling, but so delicious I had to finish it.  Unfortunately, I didn't save any room for dessert.  The presentation of the food was very artistic too.
