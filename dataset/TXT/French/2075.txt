0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g Ahhh yes, you get the service and food from this Michellin 2-star rated restaurant. Fancy..yes, service...yes, Picasso art...yes, water fountain show...a bonus.

Reservation is a must, but on our visit, there were several open tables still available. There are other Michelin star rated restaurants in Vegas, but this one gives you the opportunity to look at some fine art with one of them valued at $160 million. And you get a free show too...the water fountain at the Bellagio is right outside.

They also filmed parts of Ocean 11 here too, so it does look familiar if you've seen the movie. And although this is fine dining, you don't get the pretentious feeling like some restaurants in Paris. The servers were pretty cool, especially they deal with Vegas tourists on a daily basis. They ask you if you are seeing a show after dinner to help gauge with the timeliness of serving your meal. Very well knowledged staff that were pretty much standing by to help you throughout the night.

And now to the main event...

I went with the Menu D'egustation menu. The same for couple of friends of mine and the rest did the Prix Fixe menu. But either way, you get 4 or 5 courses. And you can pair it with their wine choice throughout the night. But we opted for a couple of red bottles since the majority of us chose the lamb as our main dish. They literally have thousands...yes literally thousands of wine to chose from...ranging from "$30 to limitless." Yes those were the exact words from the maitre d'. So yah...we went with a couple of 100 dollar bottles instead...the Ruffino 2003 chianti and the Faust 2007 cab. Both were very nice that complimented everything throughout the night.

For a quick starter, they served a potato leek soup with a skewer of quail egg, salmon and caviar. Great starter. Just drink the soup straight up and the skewer was nice and cold and very fresh.

The first course from the d'egustation menu was the Maine Lobster salad. Nice, cold, fresh with avocado and with a little tanginess from the apple champagne vinaigrette. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g?select=ZsCBs6ZyIx0c-hFK1OpRfw

Next was the pan seared U-10 day scallop. Yes...scallop...singular, but it was divine. Fatty goodiness melting in your mouth, with a potato puree  and a small amount of jus de veau (broth). So small, yet it will take you a half an hour to finish it because you will just want to savor it again and again. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g?select=HC4f8kFjLVsaWpKzdR8g1A

For the next dish, I substituted the Foie Gras and went with their sauteed ruby red shrimp. Three pieces of shrimp that came with zucchini, artichoke, tomato and a pepper vinaigrette. Again, only three pieces of shrimp but the quality was superb. Small, but somehow it was just the right amount. The presentation was very nice. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g?select=SFq-KEMsNJxloUEuJzJRTQ

For the main entree, I chose the roasted Tournedo loin of Colorado Lamb. The alternative is the sauteed filet of halibut. My lamb was cooked medium rare, very juicy, tender. It will make you go WOW. So again, savor this for awhile so your WOW can last longer. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g?select=19MjcpPDcwLUVWrtGseWAw

For the finale, I went with the berry buttermilk cake. It's a panna cotta, with raspberry syrah soup with strawberry ice cream. Very yummy with the hint of syrah wine that gives it a little kick. Great way to finish the meal. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g?select=LUOd5bR1tAh1qqGsUDJ1fw

This place has it all. 5 star service, 2 Michelin stars. Several original Picasso's throughout the restaurant. Absolutely, I will come again. Just save up at least $200 or more, or win it at the craps tables.
