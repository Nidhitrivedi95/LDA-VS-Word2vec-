Kut9tVbDX_f7qKMRRoXg3w We were going to Olive & Gourmando from across the street, but it was closed. We saw lots of diners in this restaurant and we went in. I ordered plat croque with smoked meat, which was pretty good. The story was my wife's duck pate confit, it was a disaster. The bread was old and hard, it took a good effort of jaw exercise to bite it. That's not the worst, half way through the hard work, a long hair tangled out from it. It was disgusting looking and totally knocked out our appetite. We had our waitress looked at it, she marveled "my goodness" and asked if we want a new one instead. We could not continue to eat after this and told her no. 

The item was taken out the bill, but the experience lasted and memory of that curly blond hair sticking out from the roll ruined the day. To be fair the smoke meat croque plat was good, but the incident make you wonder what's going on in the kitchen.
