AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw We ate at the bistro for breakfast and the food was amazing sooooo, yummy and we had the absolute nicest waitress actually everyone working at this establishment that we worked with had excellent service skills. The bistro is nice and cozy and you get to watch the chefs cook up your food in the middle of the restaurant. My husband had the brioche french toast with sautéed berries, it was some of the best french toast I have ever had. I had a hard time deciding because it all looked and sounded so good I wanted a croque, quiche, and eggs Benedict. I settled on the Benedict on the croissant and I was not disappointed. The eggs were cooked perfectly, the sauce was perfect and the best part the croissant. I could have eaten just that it was so buttery and flaky I was sad when it was gone. We also had passion fruit mimosas which I think they used real passion fruit juice Instead of syrup which I really appreciated. They even gave my husband a cup of what he says was great coffee, to go. We then Stopped and picked up a Sicilian, a lemon tart and some macaroons to go. I had a hard time deciding. The Sicilian was good but I wished I had gotten something with espresso or chocolate instead. The macaroons while expensive and not the absolute best ones I have ever had, were pretty good, I think the pistachio one even had real pistachios in it instead of just flavoring in it. When I'm in the area I will definitely be back here, 4 stars though because it is a bit overpriced $80 fir breakfast for  2 of us plus $32 for the take home stuff and in the restaurant there was something sticky all over the seats, my cup had major marks left on it from where the last person drank it, they need to really scrub the rims of the champagne flutes and I wish I had asked them to pack the desserts in separate containers because they had become one dessert in the container by the time I got them back to my hotel room.
