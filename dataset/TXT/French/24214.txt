I would have loved to try even more from the menu, but we went there three girls at 9:30PM, so my hunger was there, but not for long.

Service is superb and personalized.  We let the staff decide what we were going to eat, and what to drink even.  That was not disappointing. If you get there and you don't know what to get, go ahead and tell them to prepare a menu for you.

In this menu, we had the Duck Carpaccio, which was simply fabulous. Melt in your mouth, exactly what a carpaccio should be.  We also had the Beet and Goat Cheese Salad, as one of ours doesn't eat that much game and "weird" food.  A beet and goat cheese salad is so yesterday for me, but this was so well presented, as a little tower, and the flavors were just melted together, and it was probably the best beet salad I have ever had.

We had another salad after that, the squab giblets salad, which was also very flavorful and very precise in terms of taste and temperature.  As for our main, The Canard en Conserve, which is a duck leg confite served in a can, that they open at your table and dump on your plate.  The smell was so fantastic.  The slow cooked cabbage in the dish reminded me of my childhood.  A nice piece of foie gras was inserted under the skin, all for a fabulous mix of unforgettable savoriness.

They have a nice wine list too, and the markup isn't exagerrated.

Quite fantastic!
