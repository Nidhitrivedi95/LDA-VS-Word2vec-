6fPQJq4f_yiq1NHn0fd11Q Was not super impressed. My favorite thing in the whole world is a delicious crêpe. I just love them. My husband and I made it a point to stop in and have a delicious crêpe while visiting in Las Vegas. I don't know if that was this particular day or what it was but they were very expensive and definitely not worth the trouble we had to go through to have a HARD yet enormously chewy gummy unsatisfying crêpe with berries and whipped cream. I have to say the berries were better than the crêpe for sure. So if you want a handful of delicious berries you can find them here just exclude the crêpe :(
