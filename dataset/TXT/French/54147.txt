r4hP0FlsYVr-0bv-kdFIBw Last night was my first visit.  An extremely friendly, family run restaurant that is very diligent about service.  The father / chef came into the dining area quite often to check on all his guests.  It is obvious that this restaurant has a regular following, as he knew several tables.  

Note: you can bring your own bottle of wine and just be charged a corking fee. 

The food was very good, made from scratch.   Grilled apple salad with feta was excellent.  Will have to remember this for home.  Mussels in white wine sauce was perfect.  And dessert was amazing.  Maple syrup pie.  

Finished off with a decaf espresso Americano.  

Lovely evening.  Thank you.
