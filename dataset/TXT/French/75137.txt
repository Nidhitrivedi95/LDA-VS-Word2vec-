XZ7eQLjyGXf6y69UT4SGhg My experience was just that an experience. This place is new and you can tell while your there. The service is a little slow because they are working out their kinds but there products more than make up for it. 

I treated my mother out to a coffee and some sweets because I'm a good son (jk). I ordered the #3 gallete (sp?) had asked if I could get it with any other cheese because I really don't like goat cheese after the cashier ran back 3 times to ask the chef he allowed it and it was literally amazing. There's something about gruyere and not many places using it that really makes it so good when you get it, 

My mother ordered a macchiato and to her dismay she received a real macchiato and not what Starbucks brands as a sugary death trap. She was a little upset until I explained to her it was correct and she should have asked if it was American style. But she really enjoyed the flavor and just wished there was more beverage. I told her next time to get a cappuccino dry. She also got the ham and cheese croissant and it made up for all the issues with her drink. 

The only cons I noticed were the tables being kind of on top of each other so if it was actually packed you would have no privacy.  The other major con was they have no real cups that we saw. I hate drinking out of paper and plastic if I'm staying. It's not classy and it's actually cheaper to rewash cups. 

All in all I have my eyes on that tiramisu.   Someone tell me if it's as good as it looks. 

Update: the blueberry muffin looked a lot better than it tasted. It was too mushy on the inside and the blueberries were too sour. It's like they didn't get good ones. Also the plastic wrapper was fused to it so I had to like scraps out the bottom. But it looked so pretty.
