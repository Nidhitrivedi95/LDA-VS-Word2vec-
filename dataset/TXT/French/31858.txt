Gu-xs3NIQTj3Mj2xYoN2aw We were there for dinner last night, Sandy, the owner's wife was very accommodating and welcoming.  5 of us ordered from the dinner specials menu.  They were all delicious and each dish was nicely presented.  The cream of broccoli soup was to die for and when it came to dessert time I wanted them all!  The price also includes coffee or tea, what a deal!! I enjoyed the decorations and it's atmosphere, reminded me a lot of fond memories of Hong Kong.  Wished I live closer!!!
