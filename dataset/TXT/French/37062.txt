intKyiipUlHDWi_chv0f3A The best happy hour! We ordered some delicious eggplant ravioli, bourbon meatballs and mushroom flatbread and EVERYTHING was spectacular. Plus, you cannot beat the happy hour pricing. The drinks were also great ($6 cocktails at happy hour!) and the server/bartenders were very welcoming and friendly. Casual vibe, yummy food and fantastic service!
