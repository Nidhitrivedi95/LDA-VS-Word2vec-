rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Sunday breakfast brunch at Bouchon started with a soy latte. My first thought was - hmm, it's alright.

Next was the house bread, and I loved it. You can't beat any bakeries, warm and crispy like fresh out of the oven.

Then, raw oysters and bloody mary. Raw oysters are... raw oysters and there wasn't much exciting to mention as long as they are fresh. Blood mary was spicy and refreshing. It went well with the oysters.

My main course was pan fried trout with roasted almonds and french beans. The flavor was influenced by butter used for frying. Other than that, it wasn't made with complicated spices, and was kept simple. Roasted almonds were crunchy and kept with the aroma of almonds.  French beans were soaked into the butter sauce used for frying. This is a nice offering for brunch because it was not too heavy, yet too light.

Bouchon is definitely a place I'd recommend, especially sitting outdoor for lunch/brunch on a warm and sunny day.
