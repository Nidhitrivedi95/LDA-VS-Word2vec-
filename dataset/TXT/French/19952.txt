aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw I haven't so far had any bad experiences with Bouchon.

I had on the first visit a yogurt parfait and a pistachio macaron.  They were superb (esp the macaron...lol)

Second time I went I had valrhona chocolate cupcake and a chocolate bouchon.  

And Third time I had a lemon macaron.   So good.   

All were superb.
