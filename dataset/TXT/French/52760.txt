qc-ehqqIF7bNpP-OmfEG3g Nice location, on the water, in a cool little box. Lobster is good but not out of this world or anything. The sandwich you get for $10 is tiny (understandably so, lobster is not cheap). Worth a trip for a snack but don't go here if you're hungry looking for a meal because you will end up spending a lot.
