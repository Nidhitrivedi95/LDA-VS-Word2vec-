Vkl5QgIfpi6fS-Xox1EOug My first time at LET and I will definitely be going back.  The occasion was a family birthday, and everything we ordered was delicious.  The service was prompt and attentive, great cocktails, warm atmosphere without being overly loud, and the food was delicious!

I would especially recommend the beet salad and poudding chomeur!
