xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g Excellent views from our table! If you are a party of 2 you will get to sit right next to the window facing the bellagio fountain. If it's a bigger party then u will not be able to sit right next to the window. Service is very nice! Reservation is almost a must for dinner. I subtracted one star because the food was good but not excellent. I was hoping for more gourmet food and most choices on the menu. I would come back and try brunch during the day again.
