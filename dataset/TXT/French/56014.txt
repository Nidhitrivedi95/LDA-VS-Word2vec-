rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Had a great weekday breakfast here. It being in Las Vegas, it's an elegant French restaurant set inside an Italian-themed hotel. 

Chicken and waffles -- Astonishing. The waffles, with bacon and chives, were incredibly light, practically floating away as you eat it. With just a touch of maple syrup, they were unforgettable. The chicken was nicely done, with a perfectly crispy skin. 

Pecan sticky bun -- Delicious, not too sweet, with lots of pecans. 

French onion soup -- The melted cheese that covers the top and the sides of the cup was chewy and addictive. 

We also got the beignets, which were good, but basically cinnamon donuts. The American breakfast is a pretty decent deal considering, coming with a pastry, juice and coffee, as well as eggs, bacon, sausage, potatoes and toast. The homemade cherry jam for the toast was also exceptional.

Given the service, atmosphere and food, the price was reasonable.
