w2tr0PA0b3tg8pId0kjM-A I go here probably two to five times a month and I love it every time. My boyfriend lives two blocks down so pretty much everytime we are on a walk I make him stop for at least a macaron. So I have probably tried 50% of the desserts and 25% of the macarons. My favorites are the pistachio, cappuccino, and nutella macarons. I really like the opera cake and the Paris-brest desserts. If you are in squirrel hill you must stop by its so delicious.
