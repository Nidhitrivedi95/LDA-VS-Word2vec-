hzyvL2v97xLzLbLXcdi1uw Nutella!! Cookie Butter!!  Crepes!! Seriously, who would not love it here? Love the banelle (banana and Nutella crepe) and the French toast with strawberries is cooked perfectly. The staff is just so nice as well! Don't be put off by the basement entrance: it's actually quite cozy and inviting once you get inside. The house ice tea is refreshing and the Nutella hot chocolate is fabulous.  Did I forget to mention the Nutella menu items?! They have a nice list of savory items as well but they always get me at "Nutella"!  Kid friendly and free wi-fi
