OkC86YtZ0Nm19my5F4GGrQ I loved everything about this place, and had the best meal I've had in a long time!  So lets get to it...

The atmosphere is perfect.  It's beautifully decorated and dimly lit. I've never been to Paris, so this will have to do. Someone mentioned it being a bit snug, but I liked that. We walked in around 7:30 on a Thursday night with no wait.  Our server was great. We had wine as soon as we walked in, salads within 10 minutes of ordering, and dinner within 10 minutes of finishing our salads. We got the house red wine.  A carafe will run you about $20.  This is about $20 cheaper than any other bottle on the menu and it was not too dry, which is how I like it.

My magnificent journey through dinner began with the frisee salad - bacon lardons (French makes anything sound beautiful), fried egg, brioche, hollandaise vinaigrette.  Now THIS is my kind of salad!  It was rich and decadent.  Next up was the Beef Brisket Tartine.  This place knows what they're doing here.  The brisket was tender and juicy. The bread was perfectly toasted.  The cheddar added the perfect amount of creaminess and salt, and the thin line of horseradish aoili married it all together.  I needed to spread this joy with my man!  Never has a man regretted ordering a filet, until this night.  I must try every tartine on this menu!  No dessert to report on.  You may think the portions look small, but let your tummy do the talking!  Everything was quite filling.

A word of warning: make sure your wallet is full when you come here!  Especially if you refill your carafe!  Our bill for two salads, two entrees, and yes, two carafes of the house red wine, was about $90.  A little indulgent for us 20-somethings, but worth every penny!
