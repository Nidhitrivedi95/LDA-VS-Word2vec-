And save room for that beyond wonderful fluffy buttery almond croissant. But make sure to ask for it at the beginning of the meal, because they are often out and you will have to ask them to put however many you want in the oven.
They also have a beautiful pastry case.
The service is alright, very "trendy" girls that work there, not overly sweet or accommodating by any means, but they do their job.
Would I recommend this place? Yes (but I have not eaten lunch or dinner here, when I do, i will update my review)
