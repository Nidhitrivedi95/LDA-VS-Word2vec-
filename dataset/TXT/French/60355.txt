SBnpT6JDbah-5l_52GM5sw NOTHING, not a single main dish Vegetarian and no willingness to adapt anything. Fries (OK, they were vegetarian) came out cold and once the waitress dropped the food, we didn't see her. No one came around to pepper the salad (which contained fish) and the pre-ground stuff on the table didn't even come out the holes. 

Arrogant staff for mediocre food and service. Could be a gem, but isn't.
