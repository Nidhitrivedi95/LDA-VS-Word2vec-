rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A By FAR one of the worst experiences I've ever had in fine dining ever. And far below anything I've ever experienced at a Thomas Keller restaurant. 

We made reservations months in advance, and somehow we were placed in the back corner of a tiny room, when we had requested main dinning room. 

Service was so sub-par. Drinks were extremely slow to come out (thinking both empty water and wine glasses for quite some time). I physically had to walk to the front hostess area to ask where our server was for drinks before the food came out. 

Three people ordered the quiche, and it was absolutely uneatable. Two sent it back, and it was apparent the server was annoyed by it. We ordered some of the potatoes, and fries came out instead. Steak and eggs were decent and the croquet madame was good but nothing to write home about. 

We never saw a manager until the very end when he took off a round of mimosas, even after having to go find someone to help us and sending back not one but TWO dishes. 

I cannot express how disappointing this situation was - from the start to the end. Please do not waste your time here.
