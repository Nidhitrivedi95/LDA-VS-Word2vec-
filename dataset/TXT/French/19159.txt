Hubby had a wonderful cheesy squash soup that I ended up stealing, then the cod wrapped in ham with salted walnut butter, which was delicate and complex and really good. Service was excellent. This is just a nice little restaurant, with good cooking and high-quality ingredients. The food is fancy but the place is casual. You can't go wrong here.
