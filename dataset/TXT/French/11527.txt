4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Mon Ami GAG ME! Don't go here if you consider yourself a genuine foodie. Against my better judgement Hubby & I made this our first meal on our last Vegas trip. Boy were we sorry, my husband had a huge piece of paper in his sandwich( they tried to say it was the tough outer skin of an onion) we were compensated, but the quality was awful. I'm sure the masses in general think it's wonderful, so if Outback Steakhouse, Red Lobster is up your alley by all means stop on by.
