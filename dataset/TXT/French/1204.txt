_O12nlv3sISPfiNAQVLM4Q I would like to give this restaurant more stars but I simply can't. The server "forgot" to write down our order. She didn't bring the right drinks. She brought one of our friends the wrong sandwich. And then she did not put my order in at all. It's a shame. Food quality is mediocre but service is very, very disappointing.
