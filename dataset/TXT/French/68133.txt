The menu changes daily, which makes every experience a little different, a little more unique. Unfortunately this also means the menu selection is rather limited to a few dishes, making it particularly difficult if you are a vegetarian or a picky eater. 

The waiters/waitresses are kind, helpful, and friendly, and are great when it comes to asking for suggestions or altering a dish to your liking.
