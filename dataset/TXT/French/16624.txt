8ciT6qjI18x9EPtOb-gqYQ Dined at Coup Des Tartes last night for Restaurant Week. Very busy night, bustling little place.

The restaurant is located in a cottage and its courtyard/patio on 16th Street. Parking was a bit challenging, they have a small lot. We poached a spot in the adjacent apartment complex. CDT is BYOB with a 10 dollar corkage fee. Good to remember that Total Wine is only a block away for a stop prior to coming here! Very busy night in the middle of restaurant week. We were seated in the patio which was a bit toasty in mid-September, but tolerable. Service was good, prompt but not overbearing. 

I had the Stuffed Calamari appetizer, nicely baked so without the heft of frying. Delicious....my date had the pear salad and reported it was very good. Entrees were fantastic, my filet was perfectly seasoned, a perfect medium-rare. Exactly how prime beef should be! My companion's sea bass was equally delicious. Desserts were OK (I'm not much of a dessertophile, though). Berry tarte and chocolate-caramel Fleur-de-Sel. 

If you want a nice romantic "special events" meal, this is a great choice (especially if you want to celebrate with a really fine bottle of wine). I'll make it back before too long.
