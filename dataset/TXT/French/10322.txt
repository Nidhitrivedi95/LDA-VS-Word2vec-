4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw This was my third time eating here over the past seven years or so, and I've always ordered the same thing:  The Steak Frites with Brandy Peppercorn Sauce.  

It's a Top Sirloin, pounded very thin, but still very tender, and the sauce is wonderful.  My only quibble is that they've changed the style of their frites (again) and no longer have the shoestrings.  The new frites are so crisp they've not so good for dipping in the excess peppercorn sauce (half the fun).

Unlike me, my wife ordered the Filet Mignon with Merlot Butter, Rare.  Normally I like my steak medium rare (this this was really, really rare), but I tried a bite and it was hands-down the most tender piece of beef I can ever remember tasting.  Almost like perfect, seared ahi tuna.  Wow.  I also learned that you can order any of their steaks with any of the sauces.  So next time, I'll probably mix and match with the Filet.

All in all, one of my favorite places to eat in Vegas.  Excellent service and extensive wine list, too.  So why only 4 stars?  Well, I miss the shoestring frites -- a lot.  That's probably only worth a 1/2 star deduction, but Yelp doesn't do 1/2's.
