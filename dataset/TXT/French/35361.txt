Ht-_i0UAq7YDBaqJwcQMdQ This is easily one of my favorite restaurants in Montreal.

It's the kind place that you want to try everything on the menu... if price weren't an issue. My waiter went through the short menu and described everything in precise detail, which took at least 10 minutes. I kind of felt bad, but everything sounded so good. Signature scallops were a bit small, but so flavorful and sweet. Poached oyster shooters were fun. Braised pork risotto is amazing. I had the fish of the day, which had a foie gras sauce. Awesome. But next time, I have to try the surf and turf.

Tips: Trendy place; dress accordingly.
