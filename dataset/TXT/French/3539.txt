1LELXxqe2IM2opJbi4dcaA I come here all the time because i live around the corner, the food is good but overpriced. Hangover food more than anything. I just xame on here to say that they usually take a long time...by long i mean minimum 10 mins. Avwrgae 15. Right now its been 25 mins ive had time to go outside and smoke, and even to download this app just to write this review. They are unapologetically slow and don't care. Several people have complained and i still don't have my food. Imagine if i was at my work lunch break....ridiculous.
