rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Dinner review!

Came to Bouchon for brunch and loved it, so I wanted to come back for dinner.  I would rate dinner at 4 to 4.5 stars, brunch at 5 stars.

As always with Thomas Keller's restaurants, the service is stellar.  Our waiter was extremely knowledgeable and helpful.  They brought us complimentary creme brulee and a brownie dessert for my friend's birthday.  Our waiter made fantastic wine recommendations and split our checks without complaint.  The host came by several times to check if we were enjoying our meal.  Service - 5 stars.

(Pictures posted) I ordered the scallops; my friends ordered the lamb, steak frites, and the chicken.  The lamb was very good - tender and flavorful.  The steak frites were pretty standard for a nice restaurant.  I would definitely order the scallops again and probably try the lamb as well.  I also had the pear martini, which was bombbbb.

Overall, we had a great dining experience at Bouchon.  Dinner is significantly more pricey than brunch, so be prepared for that.  I would definitely eat here again for brunch and recommend trying out dinner at least once.
