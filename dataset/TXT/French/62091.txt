SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ I am giving this 4 stars because of the service. The wait staff, while friendly and courteous, is grossly overworked.  We saw our waiter about once every 30 minutes. (Dinner took 3 1/2 hours and it should have taken 2.)  They really need to hire more people!  My advise is only go when you have lots of time and nowhere to be afterwards. 
The food is excellent - everyone in our party loved what they ordered.  The ambiance is amazing... a small home and stable with lots of architectural character that has been converted into a restaurant.  The large outdoor terrace is awesome - big trees and spray misters to keep you comfortable even when the weather is hot.  An easy walk from bustling Mill Street, but you feel like you have left the city!
