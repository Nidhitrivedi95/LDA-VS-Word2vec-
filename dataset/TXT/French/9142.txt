You can sit inside or out on the patio, if you're on the patio you get a great view of the strip which is nice. If you sit inside you can still see out but it's a bit quieter. The only thing that is a bit inconvenient about this place is they don't have an I -house restaurant, you have to walk through the casino a ways to get to the nearest one. They still get 5 stars though.
