lkY7son6wZKZ-eoR2HVxKg This might not be entirely fair but I want to share a little history of the Beaver Club.  Back in the 70's this place was top notch.  One of my wife's favorite restaurants.  That was a time when the Queen Elizabeth Hotel had a half dozen excellent restaurants down along the concourse.  

Years later the whole complex was scaled back or closed.
The Beaver Club was cut back in space by 50% or more and went from top notch to tacky under different operators.

I can see from the new web site that the space has been transformed to its original elegance.  Can't wait to go back and try the menu.
