mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q Fun to watch the food being prepared in front of you. We did the tasting menu and had a great time. This is one of the places we would like to re-visit. If you're into small plates with playful presentation this is where you want to be. Would give 5 stars, but our main server seemed a little bit bored, pretentious, above us, whatever, still had a good time.
