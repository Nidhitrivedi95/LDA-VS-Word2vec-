or4UVDjXEEjze3wNPjoAZA I stopped here the other afternoon for a quick drink - It was a beautiful sunny afternoon in Scottsdale and I was out shopping and maybe quite possibly afternoon restaurant/bar hopping! I was slightly enjoying the fact that everyone else in the country was in a deep freeze and here I am in beautiful sunny 75 degree in January Scottsdale Az.
We sat down and ordered a couple bloody mary's and then my eyes rested upon the fresh oyster display they had next to the bar - I LOVE oysters and frankly I had to try some! I ordered half a dozen oysters - I can't remember exactly where the oysters were from, but I ordered two of each of the available oysters. All 3 varieties were fresh and delicious! Service was great and our bloody mary's complimented the oysters perfectly! I can't wait to come back here for a leisurely lunch.
