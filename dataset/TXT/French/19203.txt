It is a small outlet hidden behind the escalator on the casino level of the Venetian, so may be a little hard to find if you don't know what you are looking for. They seem to be pretty popular as I've encountered a line each time, but it moves fast. I've tried a bunch of their baked good like cupcakes, chocolate croissants, danish, scones, sticky buns, beignets, cookies etc over my visits. All their products are fresh and taste great specially the sticky buns which are loaded with pecans and have a coating of caramelized sugar which balances the taste of the pecans very well still they tend to be on the sweet side. The cream danish on the other hand has only a mildly sweet filling that will appeal to people who don't want their deserts too sweet. Prices for most items are around the $4 mark which is in-lines with what you pay at other bakeries on the strip.
