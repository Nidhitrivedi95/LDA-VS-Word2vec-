sphMzEIqY1I2Dzv3zLZY2g Global was fantastic! I've been to the former location, so, my expectations were high. We were not disappointed!

My husband and I went during restaurant week and totally enjoyed our evening. We both tried the pork belly starter, which was tender and delicious. The filet entree was expertly cooked, with a divine reduction sauce and ginger carrot mash. I never eat my entire meal, but this time, the portions were perfect. I usually choose the restaurant I go to based off of the dessert choices, and the strawberry and rhubarb sorbet was AMAZING!

We will definitely return!
