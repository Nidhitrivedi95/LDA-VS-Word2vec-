O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q I'm going to drop this place 4 stars instead of the 3 I really feel that they deserve, because I'm biased... And for 2 reasons. But I'll start by saying, my steak was nicely marbled, and cooked properly, their fries were very nice as well, and the salad was lightly tossed in a vinaigrette and not overly drenched in the stuff.  Service, while pleasant, resistant to the idea that, I don't want fucking potato salad with this cut of meat, I would like fries... Don't ASK the chef, tell him that's what I would prefer - and he'll do it regardless of how much he hates the idea.  So, based on all of the above, I'd have given them 3 stars.

BUT

Firstly: They have, what might possibly the best cheese selection in Vegas.  My doctor hates and loves this place for me... I'm turning 30 soon, and he tells me I should take in more calcium in my diet to help my bones finish their structure properly.  Most people drink milk - I eat ooey, gooey, smelly, stinky cheese to fulfill this request of his.  Unfortunately, it's going to give me high cholesterol when I finally get the blood test he's been asking me to get for the past 3 years.

Secondly:  They have a fantastic beer selection.  I've been to quite a few places in Vegas, but this place seems to have the best selection in beer. AND they don't have Bud Light on the menu THANK GOD - A serious beer menu for a serious beer drinker. They do have a hole in the menu that, could be filled (the Sommelier agreed - And he wrote the menu) for a Porter.  But all in all, if you like beer (anything with "light" or "lite" in the name isn't beer... It's alcoholic soda water - Grow up and have something flavorful) go here for a round or two at the bar.
