WOj8nPos3R9IIf0Pyttd8g I've eaten at Lulu several times and have always had a good meal.  The food is good and service is as well.  They have a small garden in front of the restaurant that is used for preparing food in the restaurant to supplement what is purchased.  They are open at times other restaurants close, such as on Sundays and Mondays and during snow and ice storms.  During a recent winter my family and I walked and skidded there for dinner one night when the roads were not friendly for driving.  Lulu has a good bar selection and good dessert selection.  I enjoy dining there when in Charlotte visiting family.
