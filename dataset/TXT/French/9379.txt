4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I am so happy i found got to try this amazing french restaurant out during my last visit to Vegas :) Due to the high yelp reviews, this restaurant was a must try during our last vegas trip in September. Fortunately my party of three got a table as soon as we arrived! :) We had the perfect view of the outdoors! Our party ordered steak frites, classic quiche lorraine and macaroni gratin. Everything was delicious but i found the steak frites and quiche to stand out the most. The quiche was so freakin' good--I savored every last bite. I am definitely coming back as soon we we plan another vegas trip!
