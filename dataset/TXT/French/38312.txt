JezHN-9KKLTMbojq00VP0g Came here on our way to Toledo to visit family on the memorial weekend. Found this place on Yelp we've been to France and we are both fluent in French  thus we are greeted by the host who also spoke French a plus! he was nice but they were super busy.  The restaurant has a parisien feel very cool to in Ohio City hip. Ok to the review in short the food was awesome I mean very good I ordered the savory salmon crepe with a side of sausage. Very tasty and the carrot salad matched it perfectly.  Wifey ordered a salmon omelette with tomato they forgot the tomato but they remade it she also had a herbal tea I think blood orange it was great too and the homemade croissant were flaky soft warm everything you would want in  a croissant. The only reason I didn't give five stars and I really wanted to was because of the service my waitress was nice but they were slow and they just really  didn't have there stuff together it is recommended to have reservations or at least  for today I will definitely come back à bientôt!
