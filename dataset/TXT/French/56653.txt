rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I really have a complex giving this place 4 stars because the wait was a little over 1 hour. Yes they are busy but I believe it's because they are understaffed. 
The servers & hosts are all pleasant though but all I could think of was why don't have a table yet. 
We had the Omlette du jour =Omlette with goat cheese and green mesclun salad. It was nice and savory.
And the Steak hash with eggs over easy with powiths & red peppers-it was heavenly. The steak was cooked to perfection. 
The prices were reasonable but I suggest not to come hungry.
