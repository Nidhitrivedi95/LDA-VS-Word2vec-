We ordered a salad each and a sandwich to share. The sandwich was a feature not on the menu that day, Moroccan-inspired chicken with goat cheese and roasted peppers. It was fantastic. I scooped every last bite up, even though I'm trying to not eat meat or cheese. (I fail so miserably at my self-imposed dietary restrictions.) The salad was awesome too, with almondy jicama slices and a lot of other veggies. 

The highlight of the meal, other than the great service provided by Oliver (who seems to be the owner?) was the chocolate torte. This was incredible. Perfectly sweet and rich, I felt the need to run a half-marathon just to get its sugary creamy goodness off my hips. 

I wish I worked closer so that I would have an excuse to go all the time. Loved every bite!
