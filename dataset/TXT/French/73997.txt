Reservations were made for my daughter's 21st birthday dinner. Perfect. We all dressed up for dinner and made a big deal out of it which made it all the more special. The huge table next to us was filled with a large French speaking party. Loved it. They raved about their meals (in the positive). Best meal I ever had in my life. Expensive, but it was worth it.
