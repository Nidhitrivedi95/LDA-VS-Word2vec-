4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Well first off, walking up and seeing an exorbitant line gave me the idea that the place was some awesome steak house. Boy was I wrong... 
Came here with the parents and sat down a little bit after our reservation time, no big deal. The server Martan(?) was alright as he recommended a good wine for the table. Anyways, the hot baguette and pickled carrots were an alright starter. Then came the appetizer; the baked cheese (don't ask why the father thought it would be good). The baked cheese tasted more like a bowl of spaghetti o's sauce accompanied by a piece of pesto covered bread, ick. 
     Then came the entrees; I ordered the steak bordelaise which came with scrapped french fries which were probably the best part of my experience at mon ami gabi. The first couple bites of my steak were alright, as i ordered it medium, expecting it to be as so throughout, boy was I wrong (again). 2 bites through, I started noticing it was nearly impossible to cut through the steak, much less chew it, without feeling like it was about to fly away off the plate at 100 miles per hour. What I was left with was a mangled piece of tendon, and 2 half chewed rubbery pieces of meat that I couldnt muster up the courage to swallow. Bottom line, this place charges above average prices for below average food, but if you like good bread and french fries, come here I guess. You wont see me here again... for 60 bucks a head I'll wait to head to L'entrecote when I'm in London next.
