xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g Many tourists or people who live around the area come here to celebrate a special occasion. This was my case too. My boyfriend took me for my birthday while we stayed in Vegas. 

Since a lot of people  love to have dinner here, there's always a wait time. We had a reservation but still were asked to sit by the bar or just linger around for a little bit since our table was not ready. It's worth waiting though. 

Service is great. They are really on top of their jobs. Because we were going to order a bottle of wine, they brought us a specialist to tell which which wines would pair well with their dishes. Our pick was a favorite of both of us - Chateau Montelena. I ordered Muscovy Duck Breast. It was cooked to perfection. The chef was very nice and brought us a complimentary small dessert so that they could wish me happy birthday until I would get my souffle. 

The restaurant has an amazing view over the Bellagio where they do the water show every 15 minutes. It looks amazing from the top of the tower - more so when you have a seat near the window. So worth going here.
