MdjIl105vqCYUGKFSUVytA Another try for this large space at The Thompson. I would not run to try it, but if you happen to be in the area and Le Select is full, you can count on good food. 

Pros:  the decor is beautiful and they really committed to the Parisian look. Makes the once cold and open space seem way more intimate.  Some great hits at our table including the Foie Gras three ways, Oysters and the fish special. Also some fun cocktails and a pretty nice wine list. 

Cons: soulless, felt like they were not quite owning it. Reminded me of the Vegas copy of a cool French restaurant rather than the real thing. Horrible front desk/ hostesses. We had a reservation for 8 and the place was quiet but they still managed to make us feel like we were annoying them by arriving. I highly recommend that they get a new front of house manager and replace the entire team at the desk. I would never bring clients again after they felt snubbed before we even sat down. 

Overall I am glad I tried it and may head back, but will not rush and don't recommend you do either. Maybe try it for a glass of wine and a snack?  Or a late lunch on the weekend.
