Yp1swb-8pO8i-6-jaK2tsA I have been to this and other locations more times than I care to count. It is a a-ok chain restaurant that delivers good results. The food is generally good, the service is generally good, the atmosphere is very cute, and it's basically a great place for lunch with the girlfriends or any time really. 

Let's start with the decor. It is a very French/New Orleans type of feel to the place. There are a multitude of things to look at decorated on the walls. Some areas look more "classic bistro" while others have more of a "jazz" feel to them. The seating is similar to other restaurant layouts with both booths and tables and also a bar seating area. 

Next, the food. Again, I have been to this place plenty of times. It is a mixture of French bistro and American food. Nothing I have had here struck me as not good or not well made. How can you go wrong? I have mostly stuck to sandwiches and burgers.  Everything was always done to order. I do have to say the quiche is something that I get here because I can't seem to find it anywhere else. The onion soup is also delicious. 

I would definitely rather come here than many other chains even if for the atmosphere alone. Unfortunately they are far from home so it is either a destination, or a coincidence when I do come.
