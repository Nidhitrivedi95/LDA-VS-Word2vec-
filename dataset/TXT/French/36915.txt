in3zjiaLpNzr9G3K35gAJQ I've come here a few times, mostly for lunch and I love it every time.  They serve the softest, warmest buttered croissants at the beginning - and don't be shy to ask for more! They are very nice about it.  And they are free!  They have a daily lunch special board - it used to be $10 but when we went yesterday, the price has gone up to $13.  The entree's look small, but they actually filled me up.  I had the beef bourguignon with mashed potatoes.  It was good but got heavy towards the end, so I traded with my brother, he ordered the pesto pasta ($7) with and added chicken (+$2).  The pesto pasta was very light but almost a little too bland.  At the end, you also get a complimentary dessert.  Our dessert yesterday was a flourless chocolate brownie with a dollop of vanilla ice cream on top.  It was so good!  That definitely made me super full.  I would come back again for lunch.  The place is small and quaint and the price may seem pricey for lunch, but the quality surpasses the price.
