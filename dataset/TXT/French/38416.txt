jfOyDJ-W4lV47Y61pPcMfQ I have to say I had high expectations but I was disappointed .. So were my friends ... There was nothing to brag about... The food was tasteless and sides were nothing impressive... I love Le Quartier General from the same owners... Too bad .. But since it's new we'll see how it turns out in the future!
