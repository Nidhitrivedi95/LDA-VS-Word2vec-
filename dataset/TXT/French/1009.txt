I stood in line with my husband ( I stood in front of him) - the seating host (male, thin with glasses) skipped over me and asked if my husband needed help. 

Ok....will give him the benefit of the doubt...maybe I'm invisible. 

Later after we are seated with our party of 12 (birthday brunch for a friend) - the majority of the group were female with 3 guys. The host goes up to the far end of the table to a MALE diner to confirm, "is this Shelly's reservation?"

Weird right? He's clearly not Shelly?! Does this guy just not see or talk to women??
