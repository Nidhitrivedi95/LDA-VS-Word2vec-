6fPQJq4f_yiq1NHn0fd11Q We always get the French riviera and salmon crepes and they are delicious! We have also had the chicken cordon blue, but the chicken was a little overdone. This was still very good and it came w/sautéd spinach and fries and a delicious cream based mushroom sauce.

I think they also have 1/2 off bottles of wine on Mon & Tues. This place has adorable decor and I can't wait to go check out the new downtown long beach location.
