E9HkUYYO_-5vKjvBwLuDIw Very beautiful place! We were surprised at how lovely the interior was. Great atmosphere! Great place to take pictures. 

We started off with some regular water which was served in a beautiful bottle. Bread and butter was served. The bread was delicious. The butter was soft which I appreciated. We got the eggs Mimosa. Which were basically hard-boiled eggs served in a fancy matter. 

Next, we got our entrées. I got the shrimp salad. I really love the tasty shrimp! He got the flank steak with the french fries. We both really enjoyed the french fries that were thinly cut. 

Last for dessert, we chose the Tiramisu. It was complementary this time through Yelp. You can check to see if it will still be complementary next time you go. 

Overall, this is a beautiful place that serves delicious meals. The service was excellent as well.
