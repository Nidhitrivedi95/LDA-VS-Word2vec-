OZKo0tpRrgYoLw5mzKmX-Q J'ai mangé et ai aimé! 

...I had to practice what little French I know in my first review of a French restaurant in Europe... There, that should be enough qualifiers before I share my uneducated, inexperienced, but very opinionated opinion on this French dining experience.

Le Mouton Noir did not disappoint in its French cuisine, decor, or atmosphere. Anticipation started the moment we sat down and wafts of Garlic from the kitchen met our noses--a warm French greeting even the staff couldn't outdo. The sights around with large chalk boards, dark wood, and sparsely placed artwork were inviting, cozy and welcoming for our party of seven. Upon entering the restaurant were greetings from staff with French accents, which added to the overall "authentic" feeling character of Le Mouton Noir.

My meal began with a starter (a very large portion) of Garlic and Butter Mussels, which were some of the best mussels I've ever had. Followed by the Whole Sea Bream with Tomatoes, Chick Peas, Potatoes, Caramelised Onions, and Basil. Savouring every bite of my fish, I believe I was the last to finish my meal. Sea Bream being one of those amazing fish that is neither too fishy nor without flavour, neither too flaky nor too thick, and was therefore a perfect choice to receive the excellent preparation--forcing me to take even more time then I usually do eating my meal.

Even the laid back culture of the French did not escape us at Le Mounton Noir, which I'm convinced is part of a French conspiracy to tease and heighten anticipation, therefore elevating overall satisfaction once that something arrives... say waiting 10-15 minutes for the bill? Not to worry though, we were all too satisfied in our culinary comas to really complain about that. Even now, days after the experience, I cannot bring myself to demerit one star from Le Mounton Noir--Mangez là!
