vLkKorA1gPS97Zj0_WKA0Q Great dinner with amazing view.
I was not disappointed at all.
We were greeted by a very friendly staff. They took care of our personal belongings and explained the menu to us in great detail. The service was friendly but professional at the same time. We were seated next to a huge glass window so the view was nice as well.
