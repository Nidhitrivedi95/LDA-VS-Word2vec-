4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw This place was fabulous! Normally I have low expectations for places on the strip, where usually food is crazy pricey and mediocre tasting at best. But Mon Ami Gabi is the exception to this rule. I was able to get a same day reservation, and though the wait for outside was over 2 hrs, we got a window seat inside so we could watch the Bellagio water show while we dined.

The crusty bread they bring you is Warm and in a little paper sleeve- love the delicious details! And the mussels were very tasty (I had them as an entree). Everyone around the table loved their food.

Great prices, great view, great food. DEFINITELY GO!
