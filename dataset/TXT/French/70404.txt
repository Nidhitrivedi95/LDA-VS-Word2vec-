Followed the recommendation of Jackie, the bao and I finally made a trip to Muncheez at Shops on Yonge for some savoury crepes! I'm not a big fan of savory crepes but this place certainly blew me away. Definitely the BEST crepe I have ever had in a long while! Staff there were very friendly and welcoming. Crepes were reasonably priced. Highly recommend this place to you all :)

Ordered the Mother Nature (veggie) crepe to share. Lots of fresh ingredients used. They made their own crepe batter... healthier that way ^^ You can see how they prep and make the crepes with the open styled kitchen! The crepe was delicious, crispy and hot to the very last bite! I love how they presented it on a metal crepe stand... looked great and made it so much easier to eat.

The only con I have was the price of the sugar cane drink. $5.99 is expensive IMO. That's only because I grew up drinking sugar cane juice and it doesn't cost me that much lol. But I have to admit that the lemon was a very nice touch to the drink (+50 cents). I would still recommend it for those who have never tried sugar cane juice... it is quite refreshing on a hot summer day!

But yeaa, I'm so coming back for more crepes later, need to try the sweets! Who can say no to marshmallow & nutella? *drools* The bao said she can eat this everyday if they open one near her :D That means a lot lol.

Keep up the great work, Muncheez!
