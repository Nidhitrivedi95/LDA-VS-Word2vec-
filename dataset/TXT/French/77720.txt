YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g Deliciously good value! I honestly didn't find this restaurant that expensive given the quality of food. This could be that my standards of what counts for expensive are all out of whack after a string of triple digit restaurant bills--but I thought the prices here were spot on for a nice dinner out. Not cheap, but definitely not as expensive as they could be elsewhere!

Onion soup = fantastic. I stole half of my boyfriend's soup as I was jealous that I didn't order it for myself. Not that my ahi tuna tartar was not delicious...but oooh the soup, it causes me to make primordial sounds.

Braised veal ravioli = YUM

Short ribs = excellent! Fall off the bone! Very pretty presentation.

Chocolate souffle = large and chocolatey delicious! I'm convinced they put something in this souffle though that causes intense food coma. Immediately after eating it, I had to lean on my boyfriend to get out of the restaurant and passed out in bed with my shoes on.

The atmosphere of this restaurant is really comfortable--it's not so fancy that it becomes intimidating (see Joel Robuchon, although I would kill to eat there again). Also, I'm in love with all the china at this restaurant. Every piece. Every dish that came resulted in me fawning over the new piece of china. I am crushed to discover that it was designed especially for this Vegas restaurant (it says so on the bottom of the butter plate. If you're going to check, I suggest you remove the butter from the plate before doing so....so that your butter does not roll off your plate and onto the ground--oops). Somebody tell me where I can find similar china!
