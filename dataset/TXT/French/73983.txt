xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g View of Bellagio water show is outstanding. Food was delicious! I may or may not have had their amazing banana soufflé. (Yes, I did and would do again!)  The service was efficient. I dined alone and had made a 515 pm reservation to ensure a window seat. The efficiency is the reason for four vs five starts: the waiterade me feel it was more of a production than an experience. A bit more personalization would have got me to give five stars. It was def worth the money and time to eat here!
