xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g Great view, great services. I loved my food.. My only complain about this place is that I ordered a bottle of wine, and my server misunderstood me and brought me a glass.. I quickly corrected him and told him it was a bottle he kindly apologized and brought me the bottle. Except when the bill came BOTH were charged... I'm not one to complain so I just payed. But it upset me.. Other than that!! GREAT place to visit in Vegas. Great viewing area of the water show! Great for a nice date :)
