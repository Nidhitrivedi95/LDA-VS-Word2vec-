They use amazing ingredients and you can really taste the difference. My brother is in love with their burger and orders it every time. Their drunk bread is very rich and reminds me of cheese fondue, definitely worth sharing with your party. Their seafood linguine is absolutely amazing and I was shocked with how much seafood it came with; I definitely got my money's worth. Similarly the seafood salad had copious amounts of fresh, delicious seafood. The wild mushroom and swiss sandwich was bursting with a variety of different mushrooms and cheese and came with a side salad. There were enough mushrooms and cheese inside it to make a whole other sandwich. You honestly can't go wrong with a single item on the menu. I have yet to come for their brunch but I will be sure to try it out in the near future.
