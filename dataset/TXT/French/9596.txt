4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw We were between a 3 and 4 on this place. The food, service and ambiance were all nice.. better than a 3 but not quite a 4. We decided to go higher because there was a make your own bloody mary bar which added to the fun of the restaurant. There was also a long line when we got there are were seated quickly without a reservation. I'd come back.
