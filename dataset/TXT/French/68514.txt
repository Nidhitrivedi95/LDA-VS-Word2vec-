vLkKorA1gPS97Zj0_WKA0Q We went there for our anniversary last week.

My husband ordered the complete tasting menu with wine pairing and I ordered the 3 course tasting menu.

The service was horrible. Starving, they made me wait 1 hour for my first appetizer and 1 hour and 1/2 for the second which they made a mistake by serving me my husband's order (it was a mini portion of a cooked fish with the top being cooked but the inside totally RAW- I MEAN IF WE WANTED SASHIMI WE WOULD GO TO A SUSHI RESTAURANT- WHY WOULD WE PAY 400$ FOR TASTING MENU WHEN THEY CAN'T EVEN COOK A PIECE OF FISH????). So in 2 hours and 1/2 I pretty much had 1 appetizer and 1 cocktail. 

On top of the awful food, for my husband's second dish, the waiter served him his wine 30 minutes before they served him his dish so by the time he got anything to eat the wine was already finished and we were told no refills.  For his third dish, he got the food 30 minutes before they served him his wine so by the time my husband received his wine for his wine pairing he was already done eating.

It was truly a horrible experience.

I was really starving. We were seated at 6:30pm and furiously left the restaurant by 9pm. in 2 hours 1/2, I've had 1 appetizer and my husband had 3 courses of his 6 course tasting menu with 1 of the 3 being raw.

What else can I say about this restaurant?????????

We did not expect to get this low standard of service and food for this type of restaurant. It was really disapointing.
