rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Pretty damn good. Nice atmosphere. Small complaint: Menu print was pretty small, and lighting is not great. Our waiter had to actually give us a flash light. And surprisingly empty for a Thursday night! 

Overall, very good food that was prepared thoughtfully. I had the butternut squash soup, a special for the day, that was smooth, slightly sweet, and nice. Gnocchi in brown butter was a nice dish, and the quince was a tasteful touch.
