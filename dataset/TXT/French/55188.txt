rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A A disappointment to say the least.  The evening started off with a so so greeting from the hostess.  The lighting at the table was so dim I had trouble reading it(can you get rid of the menu printed on that ridiculous brown paper?)  The waitress seemed nervous as if it was her first day. To all,make sure your dental work is in good order to chomp through the bread.  The pate was so so,the onion soup mediocre. I had the mussels which were ok at best,a number of them did not open when cooked and a number were gritty. My dining companion had the trout which was alright but nothing to rave over. We had to ask to have our wine refilled. We did not stay for dessert or coffee,we figured it just would be on a par with the rest of the meal.  Needless to say we won't be back. Bouchon get your act together,
