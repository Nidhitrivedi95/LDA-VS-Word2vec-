1aj4TG0eFq6NaPBKk6bK7Q I was hesitant to come here because most of the few reviews since the opening reference burgers- if I'm going to a place where the chef actually hails from France, I'm not there to order a burger. At least not on my first visit.

Stopped in for lunch with my guy- location is rustic chic with chalkboard menu and walk-up service, drinks in blue Ball brand canning jars, cute bar area and cozy seating. Lighting, fixtures, and other small details are quality- a lot of thought was put into the décor.

Seasoned brisket sandwich has onions and peppers, smoke gouda, and is a hefty size for the $9 price tag- pleasantly surprised. Awkward presentation in a bowl but I'll overlook that. Sides available include a salad or fries, opted for the latter which needed more crispiness.

EDIT: Dropping a star from my rating. Came back for a second meal that was far less satisfactory. The décor remains cute but the flavor seems to have been forgotten in the kitchen. Bummer, since there aren't many good dining options in this area to start with.
