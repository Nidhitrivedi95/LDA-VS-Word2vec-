B56AYe5GNuavMDtwFsXqzA We went for the Valentine's prix fixe and were very impressed by the food, the ambiance, and the service - once it started. We had to wait at our table for about 15-20 minutes before anyone greeted us. If it weren't for that it would have been an easy 5 star. The wine pairing was fantastic, and the dishes unique and memorable. Our favorites were the beet gnocchi with red and yellow beets, and the asparagus soufflé, which was decadently creamy. The wines were great too, with my favorite being the initial Alsace Pinot Blanc. I even had to go search it out at Total Wine the next day. My gf agreed - a great Valentine's choice!
