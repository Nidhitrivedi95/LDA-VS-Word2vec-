jLxeBgWhLRbII2ACkgH1Sg Very nice and cute place. The gentleman working at the front was very knowledgeable and was able to help us with whatever we needed. The place is nice and clean! Cheese danish is great, apple tart tastes like an apple pie. Crepes were average but still enjoyed them. Pistachio macaroons are amazing! Had to order a lot to go. Would definitely come here again
