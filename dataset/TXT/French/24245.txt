cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg I got a reservation via email for 9pm on Good Friday. We showed up and were immediately shown to our table, which was a nice surprise given how crowded the restaurant was at that time. We were seated next to the station where waiters pick up the food, cut bread, etc. It was interesting to see how they do their jobs, but it was definitely where our attention was, instead of on each other and conversation.

Nonetheless, started with duck carpaccio. It was amazing. Very rich with the egg yolk and olive oil, but such a smooth taste. I definitely recommend it. My friend had duck in a can, which is fois gras, duck breast, and cabbage cooked together in a can. It's served with a very rich, dark sauce, with some whipped cauliflower on a crostini. It was very rich and heavenly. I had duck with mushroom sauce. Again the sauce was so rich and earthy, and the duck was cooked beautifully. They serve you alot of food, so we didn't have any sides. I'm glad we didn't, as we were stuffed as it was.

Other reviews mentioned the hostess having an attitude towards english speakers and the waiters being indifferent. We are American and did not get that feeling at all. Hostess was nice, person that did my reservation over email was nice, waiters were nice. They just aren't that into refilling your wine and asking how you are doing every few minutes....but they are nice and get you your food....that's all I can ask for.

In my opinion this place is a MUST go in Montreal, and if I ever visit again, I will be back!
