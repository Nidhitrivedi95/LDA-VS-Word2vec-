UL-FJ_EMbtjfoRNA7id_Ig Really enjoyed our dinner tonight for my wife's birthday. My uncle had the breaded pork cutlet (looked amazing), my wife had the Steak Frites (she doesn't usually order steak but raved about this dish) and I had the chicken (fabulous). Everything brought to the table was nothing short of spectacular. Our waitress was great, she checked on our meals, our drinks, our desserts etc ... and didn't feel like she was over-crowding us ... just right!

The atmosphere was inviting, and the space is just right. Not too big and not too small ... just right. 

Whether you're out for a show at the Crows Nest or just a night out .. give Gare De L'est a try!!!
