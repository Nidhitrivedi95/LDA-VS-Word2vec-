bzbNGyrTwWHAgg1CqkSgeg Personally, I did not enjoy my salad. Went out to dinner with a group of friends for my sister's birthday... Our waiter forgot to put in the order for my boyfriends food. So he sat while everyone ate. By the time we got it everyone was done eating. We took his food to go instead. The waiter didn't even give us a reasoning and wasn't willing to accommodate us for the inconvenience, and to top it off, gave us an attitude when we asked to speak to the manager.  A basic plain caesar salad was $6. I had iceberg lettuce, croutons, and added chicken.... $15. $11 for a piece of chicken?? All in all, never ever ever going back there. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Over priced. The atmosphere sucks. Loud. Cramped. Portions of food are small... Leave you feeling hungry still. Would rather just go to Chili's.
