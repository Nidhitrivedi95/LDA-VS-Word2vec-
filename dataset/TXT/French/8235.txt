4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Awesome place! We went multiple times over two weeks in Vegas. We had Sarah, one of the best servers my wife and I have ever had. We could not stop raving about how great she was. 

One of the nights almost kept us from writing this review. We had an pretty horrible server: rude and very unprofessional (If you get a brown haired young woman of Hispanic descent, run!). Not wanting our experience to be tainted by one individual, we brought it up to the staff. Nancy took our comments seriously and immediately rectified the situation beyond our expectations. 

All in all, the atmosphere, staff and views from this restaurant are second to none. A MUST go for a trip of any length in Vegas!
