HiMb8cwGsnFVwYxt1h0RCg Recently discovered this hidden gem on Cherrier street across the street from Lafontaine Park and absolutely loved the food service and cozy ambiance. This tucked away resto offers a stunnung view of Lafontaine park. The resto itself is large enough to hold groups of 10-12 people. It has has quite a few booths that sit 4 to 6 people. Service is super friendly and this resto actually takes reservations for breakfast so no line-ups!  The food was absolutely delicious!  One of the best breakfast places I have been too. I had the quebecois omellette which comes with potatoes and a delicious big fruit bowl. The other classic breakfast dishes such as eggs Benedict and eggs, bacon and pancakes were also a hit with friends . The fruit bowl was pretty impressive as it contained a wide variety of fruits from yellow cantaloupe, watermelon, cherries to a slice of passion fruit!  The prices are so reasonable not expensice at all for the great quality of food and portion!  Will definitely go back!
