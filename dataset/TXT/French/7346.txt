4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Celebrated our first wedding anniversary with my wife and was very happy with both the food and service!  

For our dinner we had the Salmon Tartare, Roquefort and Fillet Mignon Merlot steaks.  The Tartare didn't impress me too much but overall it was fresh and a nice start to the dinner.  I ordered the Roquefort steak which came with a blue cheese spread and it was perfect!  I particularly enjoy bleu cheese and it had just the right amount.  My wife had the Filet Mignon Merlot which came out amazing as well.  We didn't order any sides as that was more than enough food for us.

The other reasons why this place gets a 5-stars is the service and view!  Our watier was very attentive not only to us but to all his tables and took such good care of all his tables.  We were lucky enough to sit outside on the patio and had a great view of the Bellagio water fountain.  

Overall it was a great experience and would likely recommend this place to friends looking for a good meal in Vegas.
