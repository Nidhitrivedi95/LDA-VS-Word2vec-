xaqW4NkmUCGRRjmLxiFJ6Q Wow I see why reviews are so high. It was legitimately good! I'm definitely a fan. How wonderful... now I can get my Sushi Bong, Muncheez and Love Me Sweet cheese cake fix at the same time!

Went here with my friends and we waited a while (25 mins?). They seemed understaff as orders kept being placed (either via uber eats, takeout, in person, etc.) and almost all the sit down tables were taken. However, it was definitely worth the wait. I never say this... I detest waiting for anything. 

We got a table right in front of where they make all the crepes and got to watch the art unfold. They were quite generous with their toppings. 

Ordered the El Pasido (marshmallow, avocado and nutella). It was delicious! The portion was quite big and the crepe had a little crispness to it. Plus the price definitely wasn't bad at all! There was so much nutella in there... oh boy! Yummy!

Personally, I feel they need a bigger space. 2nd location? Yes please!

Will definitely be back to try the savoury crepes!
