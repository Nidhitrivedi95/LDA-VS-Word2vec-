0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g One of the top four meals I have had.  Masa, Chef Mavro, Manresa and now Picasso.  This place deserves two stars instead of the one it has.  The foie gras was huge but cooked perfectly.  The lobster was excellent and they used only pieces that were tender and flavorful. They used truffle oil and the lobster seemed to be cold poached which is my favorite way of having it served.  The lamb was cooked perfectly and had tons of flavor.  Even the cooked tomato and fried thyme stem was delightful.  The gave us a free starter with smoked salmon, caviar and quail egg on a skewer with a cream of potato soup that was awesome.  Everyone in my party loved the desserts and were priced around $9 but the work they put into these dessets was impressive.  These desserts were very complex but made to enjoy.  I like to disect my meals and everything was difficult to manufacture but the results were awesome. The paired wines were excellent and they served nice Italian and Spanish wines.  The meal cost $1000 with tip for four but I don't mind paying that much as it was worth every penny.
