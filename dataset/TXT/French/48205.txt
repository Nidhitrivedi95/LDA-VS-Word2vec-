O66Zy8Y13VBm72ZDhS4fIg I really wanted to love Sassafraz.  The restaurant is beautiful.  One wall with a waterfall and plants...one with what looks like a very old bank vault (it's actually a red wine cellar).  Service is outstanding. 

The red oak salad was good, but dressing could have been a touch sweeter.

The pumpkin spiced Duck pate was fantastic.... smooth as silk... Just needed another piece or two of bread. 

The venison osso buco was as tough as old boots.... Extremely disappointing.... And the meat was not seasoned at all.  Salt, pepper? The sauce with it was good, but there wasn't enough of it.  And meat must be seasoned, whether there's a sauce or not. 

The filet was good, nice butter on top.  Again, meat was completely unseasoned.  The mushroom side had vinegar in it, but because they were hot, it worked....it wouldn't have otherwise! 

The chai crème Brulee was dreadful.  Not sweet enough, and some flavors don't belong in dessert.  Chai is one.  

I was also disappointed that there was no foies gras...
