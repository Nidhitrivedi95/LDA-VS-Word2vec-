Payard is a patisserie and cafe in Casesars Palace (near the gaming floor).  In addition to the food on site, Payard offers many attractive food gifts (like gourmet chocolates).  The shop has a nice high-end look to it and some of their individual desserts are impressive looking (they look similar to the individual desserts at Jean Philippe at Aria).

I recently watched Wolfgang Puck talk about how much he loves the macarons at Payard on the Food Network so I decided to give them a try.  The macarons were not available individually.  They were sold in a bag of 6 for $10.

The package indicated that the macarons were assorted flavors, but all the macarons were the same flavor, which was like a mix of hazelnut and almond.  The nutty flavor was strong and good (sweet, rich taste to the macarons). 

Unfortunately, the texture was not right.  I am not sure if it was because they might not have been fresh, but the macarons did not have that contrast between the slightly crispy pastry top and bottom with the soft and chewy center.  Instead, it was just soft and chewy all around.

Service was quick and okay.

Despite Wolfgang Puck's love of these macarons, the macarons did not appear to be the signature item here (they were hard to find and were not as lovingly displayed as some of the other desserts).  For a better macaron experience (both in flavor and texture), you should check out Bouchon Bakery at The Venetian.  If you do come here, you may want to try one of their attractive individual cakes or chocolates instead.

Caesars Palace has complimentary parking.
