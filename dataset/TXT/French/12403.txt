4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw One of several times my wife and I have dined at Mon Ami Gabi. Today was our first time for breakfast. Loved it. I had the brioche French toast with blueberry compote. It was excellent. Had a nice crust but tender inside. My wife could not decide so the server suggested she do a half order of her two top choices. Perfect. She had the bananas foster waffle and the corned beef hash. Both were excellent. 
The atmosphere is great here, the service is very good, and the food is generally very good.  It's consistent from visit to visit so we always look forward to coming back, and always recommend Mon Ami Gabi.
