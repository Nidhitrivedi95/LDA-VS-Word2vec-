fyJAqmweGm8VXnpU4CWGNw I was so looking forward to the opening of this place but have ended up being so disappointed by their food. On my first visit, I got an almond croissant and 2 macarons. (not macaroons, folks--that's a completely different cookie) The croissant was extremely dry with some sort of weird gummy paste inside. The macarons were refrigerated, which is really a crime against pastry. I get the feeling that they are not made fresh daily, which totally ruins the quality. Day old, cold macarons are never good. The filling in the pistachio one was also very greasy. I ended up spitting it out and throwing the rest away.

On my 2nd visit, I tried another croissant, another macaron and a baguette. The baguette was good but not worth a special trip for. The croissants and macarons have not improved at all. 

The dinner options seem to be more Creole based which is not really my interest. I haven't seen a lot of options available at the French grocery that make it worth a special trip. I'll just wait for the new location of Essence Bakery to open if I want good French pastries. 

I just came back from a 10 day trip to France so I've had the real deal and it's so much better than what this place has to offer. I don't really see any reason to go back.
