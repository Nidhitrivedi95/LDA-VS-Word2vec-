XZ7eQLjyGXf6y69UT4SGhg Pierre is a wonderful pastry chef. The selection Is small but what they do here is amazing. The macaroons are light, moist and full of flavor. The croissants are flaky and you can taste the butter. They do not skimp out on the ingredients. 
Next time I have to try the crepes, they look amazing.
Definitely a place to check out.
