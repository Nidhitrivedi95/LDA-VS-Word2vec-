rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Thomas Keller is a genius, the only word to describe his restaurants is perfection. From the host greeting you at the door to your waiter, the service is excellent. Our reservation for dinner was initially for inside, yet because it was a beautiful evening we requested to be seated outside and there was absolutely no fuss made over our request. 

We ordered the mussels and fries, the sauce the mussels were sitting in was delicious and so buttery probably why French food is so amazing, the butter that comes with their fresh baked bread was amazing as well. I know you're thinking it's just butter but this butter was so smooth and rich. The truffle pasta was amongst my favorite dishes. Perfectly cooked pasta with loads of truffle flavor and truffle shavings. Gnocchi and sole were also stars. The sole is light and full of flavors with just the right amount of acidity. The gnocchi was a little heavy but it had Brussel sprouts and mushrooms which was nice for texture and flavors, brussels were perfectly cooked and crunchy.  Our server made recommendations for the perfect wine pairings for each of our dishes. 

For dessert you must must order the lemon tart! It's the perfect way to end the perfect meal.
