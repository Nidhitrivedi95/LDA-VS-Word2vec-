rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Five stars for the food; minus one star for the service. 

We came as a group of 6 on a Saturday morning for brunch. We only had to wait about 10 minutes for a table which was surprising. We were given water to start and most of us ordered bellinis or mimosas; my fiancé also got a Bloody Mary. 

We ordered some beignets to share as a starter. What we didn't know was that they actually gave us two orders of them even though we only wanted one. Sneaky Bouchon Bistro! We also received French Bread which was awesome. 

The chicken and waffles was amazing. To die for. Bacon and chive waffles with sweet maple syrup, roasted tender chicken with homemade gravy. Oh man!!!! It was perfect. It also came with a little vanilla bean butter which was the perfect complement to the savory waffles. My fiancé had corned beef hash which was also awesome and house made. One friend ordered truffle fries as a substitute for the regular and it was $6 to substitute - beware! Another friend never received her side of spinach that she had ordered. 

When it came time for the check, the waiter brought one big check for all six of us. We asked him to remove the spinach and split up the checks. He came back and had removed the spinach but it was still one big check. We asked him again to split up the checks, telling him my fiancé and I were together and everyone else needed separate checks. He came back with one check for my fiancé and I, and one check for everyone else. He had to go back a third time and split everyone's checks up separately. I think he was either hungover or having a rough morning, but it was frustrating after dropping $100 on a meal for two. 

I'd come back for the food, but perhaps just with my fiancé so we don't have to deal with splitting a check again.
