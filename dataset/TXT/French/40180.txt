KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA Sunday Brunchin! Our first time here and we absolutely loved it! It's definitely a hidden gem. The food was incredible, I'm a sucker for french food. We ordered Iced Coffee, Croque Madame, Smoked Salmon Benedict with side of salad and Brioche French Toast for something sweet! I recommend all three dishes! Our waiter was very attentive and friendly, even gave us a lesson on how to pronounce the name of the restaurant Marche Bacchus! We will definitely be back. Merci.
