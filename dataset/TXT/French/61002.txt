SFnrHuVFSNiondFVUBLJZQ I had the lobster bisque which was just okay. It was a bit bland for my taste but was decent. I also had a dessert crepe...I don't remember the name but it was pretty good. It had bananas, almonds, and was served with ice cream. Service was also good. Our waitress was friendly and attentive. If you're walking around Old Montreal and want a quick bite, pop in and get a crepe!
