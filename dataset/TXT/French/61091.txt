When we were there on a weekend, the road was closed to traffic and it was completely jam packed.  If you happen to be in the Montreal area, I would recommend that you walk down this street at least once, if only just for the experience.

If you love crepes and you happen to be in Montreal, how can you not go to a crepe restaurant?  The crepes here are authentically French style, very thin but with its unique consistency, and not too sweet.  The crepe Suzette is absolutely one of the best.  It's served with an orange sauce made with fresh orange juice and Grande Marnier.  It has such a natural taste that is not syrupy or sugary.

This is DA CREPE!

If you are not a crepe person, their menu is actually quite extensive.  Other entrees available include soup, salad, sandwiches, pasta, among many other options.

On a beautiful day, you'll want to sit outside, even if you have to wait for a table.  This is truly the European style sidewalk café experience.  However, as the real estate here is very precious, expect the space to be crammed and your table is literally just several inches away from your neighbor.  If you expect privacy, this is not the right place for you.

Prices are expensive, but so is every other restaurant here in Old Town Montreal.  Service is good and friendly.  Everybody speaks English, although they always greet you in French first.  Bonjour!  Comment allez vous?

This is definitely a restaurant which I will revisit every time that I'm in the Montreal area. If you love crepes, you'll love it here!
