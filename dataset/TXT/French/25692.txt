Good Drinks.
You can get half bottle service up here.
There is a dance floor, but it's a bit on small side.
Bathrooms are interesting and sometimes the opposite sex end up some place they shouldn't.
The bartenders were friendly and quick to acknowledge and serve.
There is a smoking section on the balcony so I didn't have to deal, sweet.
Great place to chill and catch up with your friends as it wasn't too loud.
