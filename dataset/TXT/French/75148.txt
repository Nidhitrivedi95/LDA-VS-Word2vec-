XZ7eQLjyGXf6y69UT4SGhg Cafe Breizh is a small cafe with a limited non bakery menu. During our visit there was only one person taking orders which added to the wait time. We ordered a plain croissant and the La Norvegienne Galette. After placing the order at the counter we received a number and seated ourselves. Seating comfort could be improved with cushioned chairs. 
The Gallette was delivered after a short wait but not the croissant which I thought was strange since the Galette was made to order and the croissant was off the shelf and not even warmed up. After several minutes I returned to the counter and asked about the croissant and was told it would be right out. I don't if they forgot or what? 
The croissant was good but nothing special. However, the Galette with smoked salmon, sauteed vegetables (carrots, onions and celery) topped with creme chive was delicious. The salmon was juicy and nicely smoked and the vegetables were tender.
I would award four stars if the service was improved.
