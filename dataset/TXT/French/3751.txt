2B46bRpDh49eDyjXGhL_ZQ Authentic French crêpes! What more could you ask for?!?

My family and I went to France last winter and Maggie's is spot on. We are truly blessed to have some authentic cuisine in Las Vegas.

I had the savoury "Polo" (ham, spinach and bleu cheese) my wife had the "France" (egg, ham, cheese). We shared a "Domi" (caramel, vanilla ice cream, walnuts).

The crêpes are made from buckwheat flour and were thin, light and flavorful. Our savoury crêpes came with a salad as well!
