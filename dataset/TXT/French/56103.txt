rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A We had such a hard time finding the place. Our uber driver dropped us off, then we walked all around the Venetian until we figured out how to get up the elevator to the tower. By then, they were going to close lunch service. I was rely nervous that we wouldn't get in, but they were very kind. The food was excellent. We had the fois gras, mussels and steak frites. Having just returned from a trip to France, everything was familiar and seemed authentic. Next time, we are getting the seafood tower!
