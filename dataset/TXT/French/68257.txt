vg55SAkrEmuHpWfIMtJjBQ My wife (who was the girlfriend at the time of my my previous review!) and I just visited the new location and it was fantastic. The food was as good as ever and the space is great, if not a bit overly ambitious.

We both tried the Surprise 3 Course Vegetarian meal, which is basically, chef's choice for three courses. All were fantastic, but the standouts were really the baked cheese starter and this corn/tomato sauce/some kind of grain middle course. I don't know what that second dish was, but boy was it tasty! 

The service was excellent as before, so nothing to update here.

My only concerns are 1) will they be able to pack in the customers into this huge (about 100 seats) space and 2) what's the parking situation? On a weeknight we parked about a block away, which was fine, but not ideal. If they do valet on weekends, this shouldn't be an issue, but something to look out for.

Give Legume a try!
