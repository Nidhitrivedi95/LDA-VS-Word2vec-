This place is fantastic. Serious culture for Snottsdale but hey, ya gotta start somewhere. Duc (pronounced Duke) the owner (a real Frenchy) is super cool and understand satisfying customers.  You can not go wrong with any of the tarts and I am a HUGE fan of mogador. Seriously, the name alone is cool! He has brought genuine french pastries and an international flare to an area that truly needs as much diversity as it can get! Scottsdale is a better place with the Duc!
