ovtlrcsVRlgZZQUlHs_ovw I really dislike giving bad reviews, especially to an establishment owned and operated by someone as sweet as Aurora, unfortunately the staff does not have the same passion as her. Our food also was nothing extraordinary.  It had potential, however "meh, I've experienced better"

First off, we sat for 10 minutes without a waitress coming to our table. Finally when we did get seen by Jennifer, it was quite the underwhelming experience. We ordered Mac and Cheese minus the pork, the duck leg and eggplant parmigiana. 
 Oh and to start, we got a bruschetta, and also the olive selection.

On the plus side, the potatoes where on a bed of greens with a roasted potato and date vinaigrette. The duck was a very modest portion and a bit over cooked. The mac and cheese, was nothing special, and the eggplant parmigiana was undercooked to the point where the puff pastry still had a raw dough taste in the middle. 

The space is nice, and funny enough the older gentlemen sitting next to me said "don't get the steak special" when I sat down with his wife quickly chiming in stating his name in disbelief. I dunno, a restaurant where you pay $65 bucks for two to eat with no drinks, should be a bit of an experience. The servers should be professional, put together and at your table within a couple minutes to take your drink order and go over specials. I cook, and I eat. When I don't want to cook, I expect people to be on point.... and this was not.
