4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw One of our favorite places in town.  They have outdoor seating directly on the Strip, which is rare in Vegas.  The Bellagio fountains are across the street, so not only do you get wonderful food at Mon Ami Gabi, you also get a fantastic show!  The service is always wonderful.   Their wine selection is moderately priced and they have some really nice French wines.  Highly recommend!
