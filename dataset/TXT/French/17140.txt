9ET_RUNztevq4_OLAX80Gg Came for brunch: I tried the oeufs meurette and my friend had the eggs Benedict. My dish was amazing, the sauce was very good, and the meat was cooked just right. My friend said it was the best eggs Benedict she's ever had (and she's tried a lot) as it has a nice hint of lemon. 

Please note: you have to ask for the prices of each dish if you don't want the brunch prix fixe ($48), the individual entrée prices aren't on the menu, which is a bit awkward.
