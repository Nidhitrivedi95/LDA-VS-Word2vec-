We had Julie was our waitress. She came over asking what we want to drink after bringing waters to us. We said waters are fine and she seemed sour at that reply. Next we ordered our food, while waiting for our food we noticed other tables had bread. Waited about another 5 minutes, no bread. Asked another waitress who had just brought bread to a table that was seated after us if we could get some bread. She said that "he" would bring it to us. Not sure which "he" she was referring to. Needless to say we waited and waited no bread. After about 30 minutes our food arrived. My friend had asked for her burger well done and avocado on the side. The burger was medium  and the avocado was in it. About 10 minutes after we got our food Julie comes back over and asks us if we have room for dessert while holding the check in her hand. At this point we are only about half way through our meal. She says she will leave the check for us. We finished our meals and as soon as I put my credit card down to pay Julie rushed over to our table asking to run my card for me. Since there were 3 of us we wanted to split the check. Julie split the check but charged one of our cards twice failing to charge the other. Overall the food was good but the service was awful. I felt rushed the entire time plus it wasn't even a busy time to go out to eat. This all happened at 2 in the afternoon on a Wednesday.
