4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Mon Ami Gabi is located in Paris hotel and it looks like a pretty traditional French restaurant. It's very spacious on the inside with lots of tables. Don't worry about not being able to get one.

== Food ==

Mussels and fries. Delicious sauce! Creamy with a hint of wine in it. Bread's free here so dip that into the sauce! Mussels were decent size and were pretty good.  French fries were some kind of criss-cut fries.

Oysters. Nothing special about these guys but they are delicious. The oysters were interestingly pretty fresh considering that it's in the middle of no where...

== Service ==

Service was good. Tentative and friendly. The food take a while to come out since they bring everything at once.

== Overall ==

My stomach is really happy but my wallet is really sad. Doing a mussel and oyster combo is a big drain on funds, but it was great food.
