We called ahead to see if they offered a tasting and we were told YES! So when we showed up at our reservation, the server said he'd have to check with the chef and said he thinks it was okay. 
Since I understood that tasting menus can be a pain if they are not offering it to the whole restaurant, we said it was not a problem and we'd just order off regular menu.
He insisted that it was fine and so we proceeded...
From the amuse bouche, everything was OFF.
The food wasn't what the food runner told us it was, flavors were odd, some over cooked, under/over seasoned courses. It was a mess.

Has a pretty view of the strip, but that's about it.
