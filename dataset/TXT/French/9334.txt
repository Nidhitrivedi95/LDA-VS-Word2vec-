4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Place was phenomenal ate there with my friends on vacation and we wanted to have one fancy meal together. Coming from New York i expected a nice french restaurant like this to break the bank however it was actually very reasonably priced. Food was amazing the waiter brought us some delicious wine that he recommend the steak and frites were perfect. Furthermore, the place gave a wonderful baguette to start which was very typical french and the escargot and onion soup were all amazing. I will definitely return to this place on my next trip to vegas.
