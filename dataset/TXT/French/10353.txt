4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I really want to give this place 4 1/2 stars, but it seems like its not a Yelp feature.

For me, the appeal of this place was being able to sit out in the patio area across the street from the Bellagio fountains and people watch while eating good food. 
Heat is not a problem (in the warm nights) because they blast you with outdoor air conditioning.

Our waitress was not from France but I think she put on a french accent just for kicks (I didn't hear the other servers doing it) which was actually nice.

The food is worth the price but nothing spectacular. I do reccommend the scallop appetizer. We saw a guy eating it at the bar and we had to order ourselves and it was very tasty.

So why not 5 stars? Just a couple minor technical errors. They overcooked a steak and we had to send it back, and they brought out two Creme Brulee's when we ordered one. Even if they messed up with the steak... I still feel bad sending it back,but thats not something that should happen at $30 a steak.
