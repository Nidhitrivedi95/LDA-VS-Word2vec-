xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g I am usually not a fan of gourmet resturuants (as it usually entails getting charged exhorbitant prices, for very little food, for dishes where the chef's primary objective is to be unique, rather than tasting good). But I enjoyed my dinner at the Eiffel Tower....the food was excellent (although, I did order one of the most basic "non-gourmet like" items on the menu....filet mignon with a side of wild mushrooms). The atmosphere is beautiful, and upscale, with great views. The service was also excellent. Overall, It is a great place to take a date and enjoy the romantic ambience while dinning on fine food.
