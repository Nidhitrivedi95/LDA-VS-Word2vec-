KNBHGY4rQVuoHxZf_6ANuw The hotel in general is nice.  It is not far from the old town.  It is also not far from a Metro station although it took me a while to find out where it was.

I got a double upgrade to a suite room with a nice view though my Ambassador membership.  The room furnitures were out dated though.  

The lounge room food was very limited. It had the least food variety compared to all other Intercontinental I stayed before.  The staff in the lounge room was very friendly though.  It was probably not worthy to specifically booking a room with lounge access.
