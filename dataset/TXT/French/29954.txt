We came here from a recommendation, and the idea of a Steak and Frites restaurant was too cool not to try it out.

A simple menu and doing that menu right? Usually its a recipe for great tasting food.

Unfortunately they missed their mark here.

The soup was fine, and the salad fresh! A fine amount of dressing too. (Perhaps they corrected themselves based on the past reviews).

However it was the steak that was disappointing. Even under the gravy and with the fries, it was hard to ignore the fact that the steak was pretty tough and dry.

The decor and service were good, which allows me to recommend the place for a novelty "do-it-once since you're there". But I don't see myself coming back here anytime soon.
