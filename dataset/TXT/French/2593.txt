0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g Julian Serrano has done it again. Picasso is a Michelin two star restaurant and holds up to it's standards.  I recommend inside seating which incorporates the overall experience (actual Picasso paintings inside) as well as a view of the water show.  What made my experience was our server.  I forgot his name but he was knowledgeable with the menu, brought a delicious German Riesling as well as a white wine from Sweden which complimented each dish without being overbearing.  Both dangerous if I was left alone in a room with them!   We went with the Prix Fixe which changes seasonally.

For our first course we went with the Quail Salad and Pea Soup.  The pea soup was by far a great starter with pork belly (you can never go wrong with pork belly).  

Next we went with the Foie Gras which was presented such as a "thanksgiving" approach with strawberry jam and croutons.  It went well with the bread that was passed out out the beginning of our meal.  

For the third course we had the Wagyu and Deer.  The deer was cooked to perfection (I believe the chef recommended medium-rare or medium?). If you haven't had deer before, I might get chewed out for saying this but it truthfully tasted like a really well prepared steak if you're hesitant.  The braised wagyu short ribs were delicous as well.  If I had to choose between the wagyu or deer I'd go with the deer again.  

For dessert I went with the warm chocolate fondant.  Trust me chocolate lovers, this is chocolate heaven!  It is also the only chocolate dessert in the selections given as they don't need to add another. 

When we finished our dinner and prepared to walk out, we were given a complimentary box which happened to be a banana nut muffin for the following morning.
