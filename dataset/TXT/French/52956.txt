QeFsIMcIFIJcOrpthYL8jg As romantic as you want it to be, yet totally safe when I insisted my family return with me.  I was totally turned on to lamb with an oozing slab of goat cheese when I first dined here and I wanted to spread the word. And the chops.

Between walls of wine, a warm atmosphere and swirls of jazz in the air tie the experience together perfectly. Take your pick between the downstairs wine bar and the upstairs dining room with live band. The music is lively but not distracting from intimate conversation. No yelling over the table necessary. I will continue to return when in town.
