KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA This is my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas. I love the wine shop, the food, the atmosphere, the evenings with live music, and the Saturday free wine tastings. This is my oasis in the desert. Just sitting out on the patio with a glass of wine looking out over the water makes me forget all my worries. I also love that the menu changes seasonally, providing me with exciting new choices (although there are times when I really miss some dishes but have to wait to have them again, like the short ribs in the winter -- delicious!). This is also a really great place for lunch if you're not on a strict schedule. Such tastiness should not be rushed!
