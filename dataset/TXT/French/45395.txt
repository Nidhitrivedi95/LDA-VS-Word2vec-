mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q We've been a few times and love the high end dining experience in a somewhat casual environment. The food ranges from good to amazing and the service is usually spot on. 

Last night we enjoyed another great meal that was made even better by "Kenny" the bartender/mixologist. He made us several craft cocktails from scratch and hand delivered each of them to us personally, along with an explanation of what we were about to enjoy. Very nice touch!
