FUX9h1a37GJn9ge1baiNuw Food is simple and delicious. My personal favorites are the Quiches and EVERYTHING THEY HAVE FOR DESSERT. 

As other reviewers have said, the bread is the strong point, but I've yet to have anything I did not enjoy. The portions are sometimes a little smaller than I'd like but that's a relatively minor complaint - I feel like I'm getting what I'm paying for.
