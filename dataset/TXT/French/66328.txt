I called early in the afternoon for guidance on when to arrive for a 6 PM seating for two and I was told it shouldn't be a problem and was (Issue 1) given no warning whatsoever of still having to arrive early as a line forms outside the restaurant prior to opening (seemingly a regular occurrence). 

Having arrived early anyway by about an hour, I waited at a nearby Starbucks until shortly before 6pm.

Upon approaching the restaurant, I noticed a line had already formed which I immediately got on. At about 6:05 or so they began letting people in and unfortunately my wife and I were the first people to not get seated and were told we could wait 1.5 to 2 hours for a table to open up for us.

At this point we noticed a party of 2 was taking up 6 seats as the rest of their party had not yet arrived (and did not arrive until 15 minutes later (the owner messaged this to me as I had already left in disgust) - Issue 2).

Had I either been told to arrive in advance of opening (Issue 1) and/or the restaurant had a policy of not seating incomplete parties (Issue 2) could I have actually had a meal here.

i.e., if you'd like to avoid an extended wait for dinner I suggest arriving no later than 30-40 minutes before dinner service begins though it's clearly acceptable for an incomplete party to be "completed" with a 15 minute delay
