cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg I had an extremely underwhelming meal here. Tried the pickled tongue, poutine, a crab special, and PDC melting pot (which my server recommended with conviction). Tasted like standard pub fare - nothing worth making a special trip to. Fries were cold. Joe beef is miles better.
