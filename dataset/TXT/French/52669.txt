QAeOs1iB3fyn5xXl72aH8w This is a cute little chain place. I had the special August menu consisting cod goujons (croquets), steak frites and a peach crumble dessert. The starter was pretty much tasteless. The steak was thin and tough. I finished only half of it. The fries were very good. Service was a bit slow and confused. The server didn't notice, or didn't care that I ate only half of the steak. He forgot to serve the dessert. By the time we got his attention, we had to leave. It may have been fantastic, but I'll never know. I won't go back even though I'm staying across the street.
