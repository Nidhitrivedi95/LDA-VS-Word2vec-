STX8NfaW_xP6YZq-wERHYg Absolutely flawless dining experience! We made reservations here for the first time on the occasion of my wife's birthday. The waitress was very attentive and each course of our dinner just got better and better. We started out by ordering a Loire Valley white wine: a Vouvray demi-sec which immediately wowed us. We ordered cold soups as our appetizers: she had the Gazpacho and I ordered the cucumber soup. I think the gazpacho edged out the cucumber soup but both were superb. My wife ordered the Chicken Doria and I had the Tartiflette Gratinee served with side salads. These appear to be fairly simple dishes but the flavor and textures were fondly reminiscent of meals we loved while my parents lived in Europe. We shared each other's plates and while these dishes appeared overly filling, they were actually just right.  We ordered more wine and our dessert was presented with a birthday candle and a bit of fanfare from Chef Nanou herself. The lavender Creme Brule was probably the best we have tasted. I had the Cherry Clafouti and was not disappointed - we were so very impressed by this excellent meal and with our waitress who seemed to always magically appear whenever we even thought to ask about something. Chef Nanou came out twice to see how we were. What a gracious and charming host! 

I rarely think to write a restaurant review unless we are very unhappy about a terrible experience or extremely happy about a fabulous experience! This was happily the latter case!
