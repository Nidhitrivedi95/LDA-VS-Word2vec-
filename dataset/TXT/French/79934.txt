The service is very nice. 
Started with the smoked beef tartar, which I was so eager to try when I first saw it through their website. It's like an egg yolk over smoked raw grounded beef with a taste of mushrooms and mustard on the side. It turned out to be the most wonderful experience I've ever tried with starters! Everything is mixed so well together.
We also ordered the Friday night fish fry and sirloin. The fish fry was very crispy on the outside but juicy and tender in the inside. The medium rare sirloin was also very delicious, with its wonderful flavor and texture.
