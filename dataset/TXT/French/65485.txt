U1LB3sRMGTu_h7Sf9QdNoA Cute little French spot in Clarence Square! If I didn't have the address, I would totally have missed it - it's nestled in a row of townhouses.

Small, charming and cosy, and with decor and furniture that will make you feel like you're in Paris!

We were fortunate and got seated right away, but others definitely had to wait.  If you can, get a spot by the window!

I had the eggs Benedict with smoked salmon and was really pleased with my meal, and especially with the generous serving of salmon!

They serve coffees of various types and for the tea lovers, they have a box of tisanes (Kusmi of course!)

The staff is French, which adds to the atmosphere.

There was only one person waiting on tables and the same gent did the drinks, so service was a tad slow, and the server forgot our pain au chocolat.  That said, I found the spot charming and if ever I'm in the King and Spadina area, I'd consider it again!
