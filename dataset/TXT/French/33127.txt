HHvO4MgBFabsmlInou6viQ I brought a coworker here for a business lunch, and we were both so impressed by the food and charming staff/atmosphere. We order two dishes to share; Croque Madame and the Beef Bourguignon sandwich and we couldn't decide which was more delicious. Just mouth-watering, and so authentic. I highly recommend this little gem. We will be back to try the dinner menu very soon!
