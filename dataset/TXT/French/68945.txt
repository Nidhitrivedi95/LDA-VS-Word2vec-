VwZhwflLnTq19aAeFLJHCQ My girlfriend and I had dinner here this evening and it was excellent. the waitress lynn was exceptionally attentive even though we were the only ones eating outside (by request). I had the brazilian chicken which was great, my girl had vegetarian crepes. she really enjoyed both her entree and side salad which had their special beet vinaigrette.
