uP3H5bcsiTXM0k0xQhRndg We had a lot of fun at Le Robin Square. The place is a small mom and pop shop and our service was amazing. First of all, they were amazing enough to accommodate us with such a large group of 9 people and no reservation. They quickly shuffled a couple of people around and made it work. The owner and our server was great. Very passionate and talkative. She's a natural sales-person. She had all sorts of bottles of drinks and what not going in no time.

In terms of the food, the onion soup was amazing. It's much different than French Onion soup you have back in the US. It was so good... and what made it great was this apparently secret recipe jalepeno hot sauce with the chef makes. Really delicious. With that, I also had the burrata pizza. That was kind of OK. The cheese was OK, but it was a LOT. Not really what you would expect in a pizza. It was decent overall. On the dessert side... the cheesecake was kind of meh... it comes in a masonry jar with crumbles of crust sort of in there... kind of too creamy for my taste. More like a mousse than a cheesecake. I also tasted someone else's creme brulee, and that was OK.

I think the rest of the guys really enjoyed some of the mean items, like the pork belly, etc. Being a vegetarian, I didn't partake. Overall, it was a fun evening.
