4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Pretty decent place for dinner. Went in with a party of 8 ladies and I ordered the steak roquefort (steak with blue cheese sauce) and a French 75, one of their cocktails. The steak wasn't pretty decent and I loved their hand-cut fries that came along with it. I was also a fan of the bread and carrot salad that came before we got our meals.

We were drinking our cocktails as we were waiting for our food to arrive. As we were talking, we were surrounded by a group of 5-6 beautiful men who came out of nowhere and served us plates and plates of meat. That was awesome.
