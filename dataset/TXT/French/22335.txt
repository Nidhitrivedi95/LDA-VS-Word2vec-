BSmqxPbQglQwP2R56OqOag I LOVE Local Bistro. I've been here twice now and both times have been pleasantly surprised with food,   cocktails, and especially the service! Each time I have had Michael as a waiter and he is phenomenal! Very attentive, welcoming, and friendly he is a wonderful addition to the experience.

The brunch options are delicious as well as their lunch items. Yummy Lobster Mac and Cheese, pizzas are great, and I love their grilled cheese! They even offer a choice of citrus with your water! I love this place!
