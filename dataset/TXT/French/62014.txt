SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ House of Tricks was a frequent on my rotation when I worked in this area. I love the ambiance this historic house provides and in a way that makes me forget that I'm in the heart of a college town. House of Tricks slightly reminds me of a restaurant I'd find in Berkley, CA or LA. It's charming, open and has plenty of seating outside. 

The food here is basic luncheon food such as tasty sandwiches. My favorite go-to sandwich when I visit is the Tuna. The sandwiches are hefty but it's really about the atmosphere when I visit. 

I will always remember the time I was eating lunch with my sister when the red hat ladies (a group here in Phoenix) walked in and overtook the restaurant. They were so cute in their red hats and they really made me realize that the House of Tricks is your quintessential "ladies who lunch" restaurant to Tempe. I suggest that everyone tries this absolutely charming restaurant for lunch sometime.
