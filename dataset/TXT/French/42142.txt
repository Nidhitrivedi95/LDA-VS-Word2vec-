KxUczoGoAwkX9mSHwWlUAw Came here on a Friday night with friends for dinner and drinks. The restaurant is spacious with a pretty nice sized bar. They also have a DJ that starts around 9pm and goes all night. This was one of the highlights of the night as this guy really put together one of the best sets I've ever heard. The vibe is really cool and is perfect for pre gaming before night out. You can also stay here for the night since it turns into a semi club. 

We ordered an assorted appetizer to share among the group consisting of oysters, shrimp, mussels, clams fried chicken and a cheese & duck platter. Everything was pretty good, especially the fried chicken platter. For main course I had the short ribs and mashed potatoes which were delicious. Very tender and full of flavor. Definitely one of the best short ribs I've had. We stayed a while for drinks before heading out to the club scene.

Definitely a great place for a group looking for a decent dinner in a fun atmosphere. Ive definitely had better food, but otherwise its great for pre gaming.
