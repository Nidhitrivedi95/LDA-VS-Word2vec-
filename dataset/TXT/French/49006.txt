OkC86YtZ0Nm19my5F4GGrQ A quaint and welcoming spot. Too bad, as others have written, the food is off the charts salty, and the wine list is pricey. 
 The staff is friendly, but how do you make up for a cook who sends crap food out ? You would go broke comping things, but you should at least buy a drink for sending out inedible food. 
This kind of bistro food is not challenging. Soooo disappointing that it is complicated by an uneven hand in the kitchen.
