rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A We have become slight regulars here when we have our mini stay cations.  Every time besides 1 we have had excellent service.  (not going to dock for one rude comment by one server, one time when we were there beyond closing entertaining guests)  All most every time we can be seated almost immediately.  The hosted are nice and accommodating and water is brought promptly.

We keep coming back because the ambiance is so soothing even when the place is paced to noise is spread so it is never loud.  The servers are well versed in the menu and are always fast and efficient, if they don't have an answer they will find a answer.

They have a large wine collection to choose from and a nice scotch for the man.  I usually splurge because when we come here and have cosmos because we are not driving.  The cosmos are perfect not to strong and not a vodka cranberry!  They have a well stocked bar and many specialty drinks for those who prefer others.

We are not big on ordering dinners here because we like to get a selection of our favorites.  

We love to get a plate of oysters they usually have a west coast and east cost selection so if you have a preference you should be covered.  We like the west coast oyster but have a few favorites from the east as well.  If you don't know ask they will help you decide! 

We also get a Fromages (cheese plate) one mild soft for me and tow of the smellier the better for him.  The usually do good but he would prefer even stinkier! 

Foie Gras either a plate or a tub of the butter (a small tub is to much for two people) both options are really delicious. 

We usually get Truffle Pommes Frites (french fries) but the didn't have them last time so sad so we will have to find something new next time.

We have gotten many other things but these are our favorites, the menu does change and has changed so just go for it.  Every thing we have had has been good.
