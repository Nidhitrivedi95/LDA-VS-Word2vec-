_cjPEH9wXhKS-HQe_U3M4Q I went to La Select Bistro for Valentine's Day and had a great experience. It was a set 3 course menu for $59 per person which isn't too bad. 

Appetizer:
I got Salade De Homard (lobster salad with apple cider vanilla vinaigrette) and it was delicious, my date Consommé De Canard (duck consommé) and to be honest it smelt and tasted like pho. We both are Vietnamese so we got a good giggle out of his appetizer. 

Entree:
My date got Tendron De Boeuf A L'Orge (beef short rib) and he really seems to enjoy his meal, he wanted to get an extra order of the fries too. I opted for Gigot D'Agneau De L'Alberta (leg of lamb) and I wish I got a second plate of it, the lamb was so tender and delicious!

Dessert:
For dessert I quickly chose the lemon tart because I love citrus desserts but my date was unsure of what to get and asked our waiter to surprise him with something. He ended up with the Frangipane Au Boudin Aux Pommes, he enjoyed the first few bites but the fact that there was pork in his dessert quickly came to light and he ended up only finishing half of his dessert but ate the entire apple crust instead. 

Overall the experience and atmosphere was lovely for a Valentine's date. Would return again for another romantic occasion!
