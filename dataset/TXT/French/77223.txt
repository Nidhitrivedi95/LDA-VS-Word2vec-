Clearly they overbooked for Thanksgiving...this became apparent because I made a reservation a MONTH ahead and we were told it would be a 45-50 minute wait when we walked in the door at 1:45 pm.  What point is a reservation then really? 
Only because another gal told us it would be 15 minutes and we were rather vocal about the situation did they manage to acquire a booth for us about 20 minutes later. 

Then there was the food...past years we ate at another Mimi's and thoroughly enjoyed our meal and the crowd was managed much better. Additionally, there were snacks and drinks available for those having to wait to be seated (Note to Chandler location: this is extremely helpful when people are hungry and not expecting a long wait time after booking a reservation).  The salad and bread were sadly the best part of the meal...the sweet potatoes were so sweet none of us ate them and half of us wouldn't try the green bean casserole and the other half regretted that they did.  
Additionally my husband and I ordered red wine and they ran out of wine glasses so they served it up in ??? perhaps a mimosa glass. Which not only made the wine hard to drink but, frankly, it just didn't taste the same. 

The staff...good gracious, we could feel the stress the moment we walked in from the hostesses to the wait staff. Our waitress did the best she could considering the crowd but the anxiety all around was tangible and overshadowed our experience. 

Definitely decided next year, we're doing turkey at home.
