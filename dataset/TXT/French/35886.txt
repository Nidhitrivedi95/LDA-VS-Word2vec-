Her recommendations were spot on, including the bottle of red wine that my friend and I ordered. Everything just seemed delicious and worth trying! However, life isn't always that fair, SO...

For the appetizers, we shared a small lobster poutine and lentil bruschetta. I would wholeheartedly suggest the bruschetta. It was fantastic and exploding with flavour! I could have never imagined it coming together as perfectly as it did. On the other hand, I had big expectations of the lobster poutine. Unfortunately it didn't quite hit the spot, as I didn't find a single chunk of lobster in my dish... The fries tasted great, so did the lobster gravy, but I did want some lobster in my lobster-poutine. C'est tout.

For the mains, we ordered the walleye fish in bonito broth with speck and egg pasta, and the pork chops over eggplant and kale. While the walleye fish was good, it was a little on the salty side. However, my pork chops were mind blowing. I was skeptical, as I often find them to be overcooked and dry, but WOW... They were moist, tender, and flavorful, that's all I can begin to even say about them.

Honestly, I was surprised I could even get a reservation here just a day before, but it worked. Maybe because it was in the middle of the week at a late time, but no matter what, this place is constantly on the go and so bangin'. Check it out, no matter how long the wait may be!
