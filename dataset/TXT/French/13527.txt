The restaurant atmosphere is very lovely I really enjoyed eating breakfast in the Atrium over looking the strip.
I was excited for a Parisian meal but what I received was typical Vegas hotel meal.
The eggs Benedict was ok nothing to write home about. The coffee was awful! I mean awful.
If there is one reason to return to Europe it is for the coffee this is one area Mon Ami should really try to perfect.
The waitress seemed a little snobby although she was very attentive.
I would say the ambiance and service is good but the food for the prices they charge is just ok. 
Actually one of the best eggs Benedict I've had in Vegas was at New York New York in the Italian restaurant adjacent to the Lobby.

Maybe my expectations were set a little high for mon ami based on its location and reviews and that's why it fell a little short?
At any rate I give it a solid 3 stars. Bring in some authentic French coffee and I'll think about increasing it to 4. ;)
