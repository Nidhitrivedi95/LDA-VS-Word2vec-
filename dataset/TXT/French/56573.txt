rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I've always heard great things about Bouchon and since I'd been to Mon ami Gabi the last time I was in vegas, I thought I'd try Bouchon this time. I have to say that everything our group had was just amazing! We ordered their petite seafood platter for the guys - the oysters were so good we ended up ordering another dozen. They were small - just the way I like them (I think raw oysters taste better when they're young) and FRESH omg delicious! I just ordered the pate and the mixed greens salad for dinner but I thoroughly enjoyed every bit of both. Everyone at our table loved the food (we ordered everything from fish, scallops, pork belly, and even gnocchi) Everything was top notch. As is the tradition with all French restaurants, it took a while to get our food, but we took our time and enjoyed our meal. I have to say that their service is amazing too. While waiting for the rest of our party, the girls and I were sitting in the waiting area and one of the servers offered us drinks - when I told him my stomach wasn't feeling well, he brought me an orange concoction that made me feel so much better! It really meant a lot to me that he went out of his way to make me feel better so that I could enjoy my meal and the rest of our fun-filled evening. I would absolutely recommend Bouchon to anyone that wants to enjoy a nice and delicious dinner. Now I'll have to try the Bouchon here in Santa Barbara!
