4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Such a great place for breakfast!  Its a really cool feeling inside, very comfy and beautiful.  We had omelettes (spinach and goat cheese and mushroom and brie yum!) which came with hashbrowns (not potatoes, which was a little disappointing) and amazing bread with jelly on the side.  I also needed to try their homemade english muffin which was outstanding.  They also had a make your own bloody mary bar.  I'm not a fan of vodka at 10 am but it looked like it had a lot of great additions to your typical bloody mary!
The reason I didn't want to give 5 stars is the the service was not so hot.  We had to wait and flag down our rotating waiters quite a few times and one of them was not very knowledgable about the menu.  
Overall would definitely return for breakfast here the next time I'm in Vegas.  You NEED to try the jelly it is out of this world...couldn't stop eating it!
