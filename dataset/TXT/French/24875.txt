This is a great find and I'm glad that we searched Open Table after we attended a wedding downtown at a wedding chapel. I search nearby and up pops Pamplemousse and another bonus it's 1000 dining credits with Open Table. Made the reservation and headed right over.

Were greeted enthusiastically by Kiefer. He was friendly, helpful and attentive to our needs throughout the evening. He was aided by others, Nicholas and Pierre and the service was friendly and very attentive. All of the staff were in a tux or very nicely dressed in a suit. Real old time Vegas appeal here. 

When we came in the place was almost empty except for one other couple. It's a very quaint and comfy environment. Once the door is opened you're whisked away from the hustle and bustle outside into a serene and lovely setting.

We had a bottle of wine simply because my wife drinks wine and I drink Gin and Tonic, but they don't sell "spirit's" which I find odd. 

There are way too many choices so we chose the $58 per person prix-fixe menu. It was a very good choice and we were happy. We started with the large basket of vegetable and onto the soup (a tomato bisque)  and a seafood appetizer, both very tasty, but I think the soup was better. Then the granite cleanser. Nice and simple sorbet with champagne. Yummy. For our main we had a lamb shank and the wild salmon. Both were delicious and very well done and prepared. For dessert we had the Grand Marnier souffle, it was heavenly and a creme brule that came home with us for later. 

I suggest to anyone to consider this as a nice romantic and pleasant place to dine. You need to look past the adjoining neighborhood and realize that once you enter the door you escape to France and a bit of old school Vegas.
