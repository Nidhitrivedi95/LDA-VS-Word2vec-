gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg Okay - we were hungry and we wandered into here for an 'easy' meal and that usually means going to a chain.

The vegetarian pizza was so-so but had decent char.  I ran through the selection of beers and they were pretty mediocre.  A bit better than Brutopia on the beer front, so don't expect delicious beer here.

And my French sucks -- why did they name their chain after girl-on-girl three-titty bras?
