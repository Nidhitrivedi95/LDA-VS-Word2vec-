oZHbPhIj01_31jqD053a_Q Excellent experience. Enjoyed the 10 course tasting menu coupled with the wine pairing. 

Every dish had a creative spin on the presentation. It tasted great also. The girl I was with was done with her wine after round 6, so I doubled up on the wine glasses from 7 to 10. 

Incredible night to say the least. Bill hit $400, but worth every penny.
