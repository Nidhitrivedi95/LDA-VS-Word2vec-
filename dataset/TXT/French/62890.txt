SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA Quickly becoming our "go to" spot.   Lets face it.  As you get older and start having a family you only get so many opportunities to have a night out.  When you do you want to know you are going to get great food, service and a comfortable atmosphere.   They have it in spades here.  Last night we had 2 apps, a few drinks and a main course for under $100.  For food of this caliber its almost unheard of.  We have sampled the entrees and yet to have a bad one.  I would highly recommend starting your meal off with a charcuterie plate or the "French Toast".  Both are devine.  The charcuterie plate also forces you to step out of your comfort zone and try unusual things like tureen.
