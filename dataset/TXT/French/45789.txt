mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q I dined at L'Atelier a few days before New Years, 09, and it was fantabulous.  I had the Discovery Menu, and have not a complaint for anything served to me.  My favorites were the poached baby Kussi oysters in the most fabulous butter sauce, the scallop in seaweed butter, and l'anana, which was the pineapple/tahitian cheesecake dessert.  YUM!  I had the venison as my entree, which was a first time for me, but I very much enjoyed.  I must say though, it did have a very game-y, interesting flavor, so if you're not a *REAL* carnivore you might want to avoid this option.  Overall, this was a wonderful meal, I ate alone and sat at the bar and enjoyed every minute - especially being able to see the preparation process for each plate.  Next time I go I will probably have the tasting menu again, as I was comfortably full with the 9 courses served.  Or maybe I'll have the tasting menu and a couple.... ahem.... of a la carte items.... :)
