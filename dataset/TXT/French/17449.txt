9mG2yOnHtxVPEM1p8FqycA We stopped here for lunch before leaving Montreal and heading back to the States. It's a Parisian-style cafe with simple food, very friendly staff and excellent croissants. We had the quiche provencal, croque monsieur and chocolate mousse cake for lunch and got three croissants to go. (FYI, we had to order the croissants separately from the counter.) You can't really go wrong with their croissants, but our favorites were the almond and chocolate. Mmm!
