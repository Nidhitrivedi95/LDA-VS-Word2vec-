rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w Love this restaurant! 
It's gorgeous, cozy, romantic.
If you are having dinner here and having one of those tables next to the window, when the fountain in front of Bellagio is on, the view is spectacular.
Some of the waiters here have been in Vegas since 50"s and they have some pretty incredible stories. Everyone is incredibly professional but at the same time really friendly.
Truly incredible french cuisine. Every single dish was done to perfection and we had great dinner experience.
The best Dover sole I ever had. 
Fantastic selection of wines.
Definitely one of my favorite French restaurants in Vegas.
