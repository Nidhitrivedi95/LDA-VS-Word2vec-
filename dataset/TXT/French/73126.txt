xNnZ5ksBY1gwwTV2Btb4Ag I'd heard this place was hit or miss. Luckily for me last weekend it was a hit.

Group of friends gathered to celebrate with cocktails, wine and supper.
The space is very sparse and unassuming. A bit too much for my tastes, but it works for the location. Oysters on the half shell appetizers were good. Sauteed scallops with a balsamic vinaigrette were cooked to perfection.

Great place for "scenery" on a Saturday night.
