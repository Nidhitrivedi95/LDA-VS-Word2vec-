The food's presentation, temperature, freshness and of course taste is fantastic.  I ordered the pan roasted duck, and my wife had the tenderloin.  For an appetizer, we shared lobster crab cakes, and for dessert we had an amazing torte.  Everything was great, and the service was top notch!  A special thank-you to Groupon for bringing us in here.  We'll be back for sure!
