4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Came here after a full day of travel/a show at the convention center. Just looking to get out of the hotel so came down here to have a quick bite. Had a seat by the window with a great view of the strip and the Bellagio fountains. Service was terrible and my waitress was pretty snarky and rude. Had a nice glass of sancerre, and ordered the moules frites. The mussels were plump and tasty- not overcooked or chewy. The fresh baguette was perfect for dipping in the sauce and I pretty much ignored the TERRIBLE fries (and I'm not one to ignore fries). They were flat hard and tasted like they'd been prepared a week prior and sitting out on the counter since then. Bummer. The full order of mussels was way too much for me (wish the waitress had mentioned that its more than enough for two to share as a main course....) but I enjoyed it anyways. Of course it was overpriced but it was a large portion to be fair. Good place to stop if you want decent and easy food on the strip.
