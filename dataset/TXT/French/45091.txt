mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q Third visit and still my all time favorite.  I fly just to eat here, it's a destination restaurant worth the travel.   If you are foodie of any kind, try this place.  Every item is painstakingly served with care and detail seen nowhere else.  I keep coming back to Vegas just to eat here.
