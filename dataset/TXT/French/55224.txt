rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A We had dinner there this past weekend and had high hopes but they fell a little short.  It was a perfectly fine dinner but with a name like Thomas Keller attached to the name, I expect elevated everything.

We had a reservation and they ran 20 minutes past.  Our server was delightfully low-key and the appetizers were delicious.  Fresh pea soup, bib lettuce salad, and oysters. Yum!

The main course was where things started to go wrong.  All entrees were too salty to enjoy.  I ate about a quarter of my trout and my husband had about the same with his gnocchi.  Also, the portion sizes were HUGE.  I know this is America: Land of Large Portions but again, I was expecting something a bit more refined.

Add to that the fact that the restaurant terrace backs on to the pool at the Venetian which remains open until 9pm....(which means you'll be treated to whoop whoops of drunk party goers if you dine before 9pm)...it felt a little 'average' and not 'amazing.'

Not likely to return.
