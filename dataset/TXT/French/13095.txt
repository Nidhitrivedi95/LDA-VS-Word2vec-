4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Excellent breakfast and great service. 
We went earlier this week as soon as we arrived. I knew that my wife would enjoy the patio, so we made this our first place to eat. Service was very attentive, and the food was light and tasty.
Get the bananas foster waffle, its excellent. It is pricey for breakfast, but worth it. 

They do have heaters out on the patio, so you will still be warm while you eat in the morning.
