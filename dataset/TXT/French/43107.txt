LQ_gYNs5E10IGFE0NOyD7A A friend and I were out checking out happy hours due to a late dinner reservation elsewhere. We decided to check out the Upton, only to find out we missed happy hour! Tragic... Anyway, the place was hopping and we were lucky to get a couple seats at the bar. We tried a couple cocktails, with mine being the best - it was a light and refreshing drink with cucumber in it... yum. We also tried the ribs - these things were so good! The portion was huge, the flavor was bold and delicious, and the meat was falling off the bone. I wanted to have more food, but couldn't because of our dinner plans. I will definitely return, next time for happy hour!
