SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA I lovedbtge Croque Monseiur...smothered ham & cheese, bechamel sauce, sweet,savory deliciousness... I enjoyed the smoked salmon appetizer...delicate,delicious,devoured prior to photo op. The hostess was very friendly, professional, welcoming. All of the wait staff doted on me, made sure my dining needs were met...My server, Gillian, was friendly and attentive. I really appreciated that..
