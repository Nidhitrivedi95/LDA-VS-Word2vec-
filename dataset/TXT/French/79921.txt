ZrHU8ZzwZQjTRpB1K_8JTQ Great experience at Friday night fish fry. Beautiful interior, very good service and tasty food. The kids menu was great, but would like to see a drink included in the price (my daughter ordered a soda that cost almost as much as her meal). Speaking of prices, I would also like to see prices for fish fry lowered -- the restaurant says the fish is "all you can eat," but the amount served was plenty for me and my husband. I would prefer variable pricing where a diner could choose a smaller or larger serving.  But overall, we had a great time and will return.
