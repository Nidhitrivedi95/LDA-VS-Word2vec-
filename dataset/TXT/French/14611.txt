Ceasar no anchovies. "tasty but ordered it with no dressing and no croutons. It's hard to screw up a pile of romaine and charge $12 to boot. Entrees seared scallops. Scallops were tasted but far better  are to be had ( and have been) my mom and sister both ordered the roasted chicken. They  both said it was good. The chicken is served with a silly amount of fries. We skipped dessert. The service was slow and inattentive considering we were literally the only ones in the entire place. Overall the experience was not bad however I would never recommend it nor revisit.
