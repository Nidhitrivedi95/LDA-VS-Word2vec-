htQgj-ANQpZGpIpkkrEmyQ This was our third time here and the menu hasn't changed much. Same items just keep disappearing and reappearing another time. Need to break away from the frites ( doesn't matter what starch you use. A frite is a frite) although will admit that it's a great filler for the dishes. The krispy cream doughnut bread pudding was delicious.
