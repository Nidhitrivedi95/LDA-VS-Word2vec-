KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA This was my first visit to Marche Bacchus.  I was a little confused by how the wine works when we arrived in the wine store and checked in for our reservation.  The waiter explained it to me, but my wife and I stuck to ordering glasses as we wanted some champagne before dinner and we were both having different types of meat.  (You can shop the wine store and they will bring the bottle to your table; it's like cafe's in Europe and a process not often done in the US.  I think it is neat and will arrive earlier next time to choose the wine).

I started with the heirloom tomato salad and she had the scallops.  Both were delicious.  The bread was warm and tasty.  I had the halibut and she had beef tenderloin.  We ended the meal with cappuccinos and beignets.  

We were sat at an outdoor table between two covered patios and near a water fall water fountain.  It was a nice table, but the fountain made it a little noisy.  I think the fountain would also look nicer if lights were added in or around it.

My only complaint was that my water could have been filled more often, but for a busy night I was pleased with the service.

We dined on 5/31/2013 at 7 pm and our waiter was Stephen.  He was very nice.

My wife and I bought a bottle of the pinot noir she had with dinner; they sell the wines by glass by the bottle too and you can drink them there or take them home.  The wines by glass list is one of the largest and diverse I have seen; it took us 20 minutes to decide the wine and we were fine with that as it sparked conversations about the drink we love.

They also had live music.  The singer was great and not too loud. 

It took us about 1.5 hours to dine which was not a problem since dining on a lake in Las Vegas is nice; we will definitely be going back.
