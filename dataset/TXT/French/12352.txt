4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw For some reason our visitors from out of town want to head to Mon Ami. I only oblige them cuz I am a good host and I am a sucker for the view while sitting on the sidewalk. Other than the view, I just don't see it. Mediocre food to give it a compliment. As a steak house...there are over a hundred mo betta in Sin City.
