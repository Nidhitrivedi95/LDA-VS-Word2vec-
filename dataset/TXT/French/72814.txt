XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q This was dining to a whole other level. This food was definitely art. I had the 12 course tasting menu and didn't leave full. Each course are little bite sized plates. They are incredibly beautiful... I would have taken pictures but the server (from france or something) was a bit of a snob. For how much you pay I think that a kinder staff would be a little more important. I mean, we get it... this is one of the best restaurants in America. Service is just as important as the meal. The atmosphere was really rich and pretty... with all of the dramatic purple everything. It was a lot of fun!
