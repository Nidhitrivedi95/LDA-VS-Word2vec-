rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A We had reservation for 1:30PM & still had to wait for another 15 minutes upon arrival.

Host customer service at reception is mediocre, not impressive at all.

Server is average, forgetful - can be more attentive.

Free French Pain d'Epi is fresh and hot right from the oven.  It tastes good together with its jam & butter.

Roasted chicken & waffle is way too dry - thumbs down.

Grilled salmon is salty and dry - thumbs down.

The fish of the day - trout with haricots verts (French green bean) & toasted almonds on top is delicious.

A dozen of Fanny Bay (British Columbia) oysters are fresh and juicy.

Croque Madame is okay but not as good as expected.  We do expect much better since it is supposed to be a 3 STAR Michelin chef's restaurant!!

Beignets is not bad.

We can only place a 3 stars because we do expect Bouchon live up to the 3 STAR Michelin Title!!!
