4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Awesome. Salmon eggs benedict not on menu, had it like five years ago off brunch menu. Last year didn't have it on the menu, but asked waiter and he made it happen. Same thing today.  I love this place, we always stop by even if we're not staying off the strip. Just how I remembered. Tried escargot, very good.
