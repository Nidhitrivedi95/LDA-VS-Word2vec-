xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g A grand entrance from the Paris Hotel casino, up a private elevator to the restaurant.  We stopped for a drink at the bar while they prepared a table for us by the window.  A window seat here is worth the wait, with views overlooking the Bellagio fountains that I really never get tired of watching. 
Service from our waiter was professional, but not warm nor inviting. 
Apps: Seared sea scallops were great. Forget what else was ordered.
Entrees: Liked the Dover sole, loved the Beef Wellington, which was cooked perfectly and full of flavor.
Dessert: Highly recommend trying a souffle...amazing.

A nice, romantic restaurant that I would recommend trying.
