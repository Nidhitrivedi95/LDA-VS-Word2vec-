YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g Fleur tries too hard to be innovative. The bone marrow presentation was beautiful looking but bland in taste. I had to ask for a little salt and pepper to bring out the sauce and the onion jam. The filet was good, just missing a tad of salt to bring out all mr kellers intended flavors. My guess is this place will fade because the flavors are too subtle for lv tastes...
