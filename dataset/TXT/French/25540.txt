* ON the 64th floor, so no smoke from the Casino.  The restaurant was non smoking.  That said, the bar was either smoking or non-smoking was not enforced.  At certain tables it may not truly be non smoking.  Not sure about this.  

* On the 64th floor, the best view of Vegas

* 15,000 glass ball chandelier, really cool.

* We got sat next to the balcony.  One reviewer noted how hot it was outside; today it was ~50 F and ~6 tables near the balcony froze every time the door opened (which was a lot!).  This could easily be you, so be warned.  You might also sweat every time the door opens, depending on time of year.  


Service

* they showed a cheap tasting menu downstairs.  When we got upstairs, they said they didn't have it.  Not cool

* The waiters were very fast and attentive without being intrusive.  Entire staff, from waiters to busboys were really fast.  Our appetizers were out in record time.  Terrific service.

Food

* kind of expensive

* very good.  Had the lobster, beef/foie gras, crab salad, and gnocchi plus the mix candy for dessert.


Overall: go for the view.  Service is great.  Food is very good but $$.  Would give this a 4.5 star on food and service alone.  But the other stuff lower the rating. Don't trust them when they offer cheap tasting menus.    The quality of your experience may vary depending on where you get seated - and not because of the view but because of the temperature and the cigarette smoke.
