rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I've been here a few times already and every time is as good as the last. I always order the foie gras for appetizer and it is unbelievably deliciois. Had the Steak Frites medium rare and it was cooked perfecrly. I love the consistency and quality of this place. Can't wait to go again.
