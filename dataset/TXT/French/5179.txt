3FlWR_osNPb8dcqLgHebHw This review is based on the turkey dinner we ordered and the customer service. Food was great. Server did a good job making sure we were ok. Turkey was fresh, perfect mashed potatoes. Only reason I had to deduct a star wss side salad was super small but actually good and not a fan of the soggy fries. Looking forward to returning though
