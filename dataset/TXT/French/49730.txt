oS96aJIHFWcFAlGHKKXjaw I'm completely obsessed with this bakery! 

I've eaten delicious, fluffy , buttery items from this place a few days in a row already. My aunt has been so gracious and had a variety available at her home where we have been staying. But today I went in to see what else they have.

They've got pastries , cute little desserts , even sandwiches. The sandwiches looked really good! I regret not trying one. I did get a raspberry macaroon which was more soft than crunchy and it was good although  I prefer crunchy. I ordered one of those large raspberry macaroons but I haven't tried it yet. We also ordered one of those cream puffs. 

And of course we bought a few more pastries for the road. 

No regrets!

Ps. Service was great! Everyone was friendly and polite
