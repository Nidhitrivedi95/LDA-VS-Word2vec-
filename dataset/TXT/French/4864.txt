33Tr0eRki1Yamzleu4GMdw Cute bakery and cafe. Found it on my way to the dentist of all things. Decor is French country casual and offers breakfast and lunch. As pretty as everything was I was not greeted or offered help until I started asking for help. I think they were busy making drinks, but an acknowledgement would be nice. I bought some coconut macaroons and vanilla meringues to go. They were tasty and well made. I would of bought more goods or even a coffee drink, but was not offered even to do so. One would think it would be a basic question at the counter, but nope. After my total, I handed my credit card and the employee was looking off somewhere so I had an awkward moment where I was left hanging until I said, " Here's my credit card." Maybe it was just an off day, but kinda disappointed in the service. Might come back to try again if I'm in the area.
