XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q Expensive but worth every penny. The service is first class and the "outdoor" dining is optimal.  It's really inside but appears outdoors because of all the plants etc. Really easy to get full on the unlimited bread cart, so just watch out. Everything on the menu is delicious. We had the steak and pork for dinner. Every dish is cooked to perfection and the ingredients just compliment each other so well. One of the best restaurants we've ever dined out.
