hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA Go all the way to the back! Since they are only open weekdays, it's taken me forever to get down here. Maybe they just get so busy during the week from surrounding businesses they just don't want to be there on weekends? I wouldn't blame them if so!

As noted in almost every review, Oliver is awesome! This dude is excited to talk about his food and you just gotta love that! I had the bleu brie sandwich which is amazing. The bread is fresh and soft but with that perfect chewy texture. The chicken was moist and tender. With the thick slices of cheese and thin, crispy apple slices, it all just comes together for a super tasty sandwich. If you've got room after, you have to try one of the chocolate tarts with fresh whipped cream...crazy good!

Baguette Cafe is a must try spot. It's a tad on the pricy side but everything is fresh and worth it. Rumor has it that a new spots opening with weekend hours...I sure hope that's true cause I'll be there the first Saturday they're open! ;)
