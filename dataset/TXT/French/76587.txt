Yp9w4nhUowBU_IS_StFXbQ Came in w/ a rocky start since our breakfast reservation upon check-in could not be properly located by the hostess.  However, upon showing an email on our phone that we did indeed have reservations secured prior as hotel guests of the Tower suites, the experience quickly improved.  Breakfast offerings had a balanced medley of sweet & savory type standard brunch selections w/ tasteful twists to them.  Ordered the corned beef & frittata which both dishes came out beautifully presented & tasted clean not greasy.  But the 5 star rating accounts not only for the fare but also the excellent service from the wait staff.  One server in particular, Ahmad, deserving of mention provided our table with the naturally friendly & thoughtful level of customer service you can expect from a well rated fine but casual dining establishment.
