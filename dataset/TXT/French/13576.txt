4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Great gluten free menu and they even serve gluten free bread while you wait. Went to dinner last night - ordered the grilled chicken with baby kale salad and the au poirve steak...both very good. Demetrius was a great waiter; very friendly, funny, and could tell he enjoys being there. Highly recommend! Also a great place for brunch.
