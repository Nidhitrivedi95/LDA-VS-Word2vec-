9ot8oInkYZTt6wkkGe__vQ This was my first time here. Came here for Winterlicious. From the second we walked in we were treated like royalty.   I would come back solely for the service. 

After we sat down we were served some bread with a artichoke spread. The artichoke spread was really nice. I will totally have to steal that recipe. We decided to go with the wine pairing which included a 3oz, 3oz and 1oz with each of the courses respectively. 

I had the smoked salmon rillette which came with cornichon, capers, dill crème fraîche, and O&B Artisan pretzel bread. These flavors go really well with one another and it had just the right amount of every component. It was a great way to start my meal. It was paired with a sauvignon blanc from France. 

For the second course I had the duck confit with toasted barley, dried cherries, root vegetables, and spiced duck jus. The duck was cooked to perfection and forked apart. The skin was crispy. I literally scrapped the plate. This came with a pinot noir from Niagara (organized crime was the name of the winery).

For dessert I had the cardamom creme brulee. I have to mention that the cardamom flavor was completely absent from this dish. Nevertheless it was phenomenal. It was paired with a muscat from Australia.
