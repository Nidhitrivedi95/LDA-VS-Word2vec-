KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA I have been patronizing MB since it was a small but well stocked wine store owned by a lovely French couple who added a lunch counter, the impetus of the beautiful lakefront dining Mecca of today. 

Through the years, the couple retired and Jeff lovingly took the helm. The addition of the huge patio complete with misters, waterfall and fireplace only improved on ambience. Saturday free wine tastings, Jazz music, and the brilliant "choose your bottle & pay minimum corkage"  (waived Mondays) is a deal in a town that marks up wine shamelessly. Get on the email list for a heads up on special dinners/pairings, etc. 

Chef Stratta had those resistant to change up in arms, but the rotating menu & lunch specials are favorite "forget you are in Vegas" steals, with daily specials a bonus. It can get crowded as this is a power lunch spot. 

I'm a big fan of fish, simply prepared and they are always willing to adjust to requests. Mom loved a perfectly prepared roast chicken with frites and Dad is a steak man. All appetites are sated with flair. Another nice option is to choose a bottle of wine and catch up over a delightful charcuterie, beet salad or other small plates. 

The lake is lovely and the ducks charming, sometimes stealing sugar packets and napkins  Staff can be hit or miss, especially when busy but are usually hit. 

Sunday brunch is always a good call. Many friends have thanked me for introducing them to this very special spot & it has earned the nickname "your French place" 

Hope it remains so for many more years to come as small, exceptional off Strip dining is rare and should be supported, IMHO.
