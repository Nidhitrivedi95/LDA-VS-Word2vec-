Ht-_i0UAq7YDBaqJwcQMdQ We had dinner at Le Club Chasse et Pêche. Service was excellent - the servers were very knowledgeable about their menu and answered our questions about the menu very well. The atmosphere is romantic and dim-lit. Very classy :)

DRINKS:
weingut Robert Weil, Rheingau, riesling trocken 2013 (pour moi)
celler Hidalgo Albert, Priorat ''1270 a Vuit'' 2008 (pour mon copain)

TRUFFLE PASTA (5/5)
This was the special of the day and I highly recommend this! I hope they continue making this dish as a regular. The truffle flavour tasted amazing - a very nice combination with the creamy pasta. Loved this!

BRAISED PIGLET RISOTTO (3/5)
(with foie gras shavings)
I got to admit, first bite was AMAZING! But the more I ate this, the saltier it got. The foie gras shavings were perfect though (but keep in mind, I'm biased about FGs, I love them! haha)

OCEAN DELIVERY (4/5)
(Cod fish, black rice, turnips, russula)
This was so delicious. The cod fish was soft and the side dishes paired well with it. I needed something on the lighter end as my dinner from the night before was too fatty haha.

VENISON (4/5)
(hubbard squash, gnocchi, girolle, Louis d'or)
The meat was delicious and tender. I liked the purée portion of the dish - adds so much flavour to the dish!
