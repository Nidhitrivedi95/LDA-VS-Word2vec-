741v9WSq3BceeRyBLCvF9g I wanted to give this place 5 stars. From the moment I walked in, I felt remarkably calm. Even though it was 7:30PM on a Friday night, there were perhaps 10 other diners scattered around the restaurant (overall, Yunaghi maybe seats ~25). You could barely hear the other patrons over the smooth jazz that was on. 

When you are seated at your table by one of the exceptionally polite servers / hostesses, there is a little origami placeholder waiting for you (sadly, no amuse-bouche).The service is quick, and at the one odd moment when our procession of food was delayed, our waitress offered us a complimentary non-alcoholic drink (tasted like ginger 7 Up - delicious). The 6 course tasting menu is only $50 (!!!), and the sake pairing is $35. I would recommend Yunaghi if you're a fan of (i) attentive service, (ii) artistic meal presentation and / or (iii) trying different sakes (my favourite was the sake mixed with kombucha, served first).

. . . Sadly, I just couldn't get over how underwhelmed I was by the food! The first course tasted like a custard version of miso soup (served cold).The second course was a selection of mini appetizers, of which none were particularly remarkable. The third course was a warm soup, with a tiny slice of seabream (of note, I would say this sake pairing was the most intriguing). The fourth course was slices of pork jowl (which was ironically overwhelmingly salty) and random vegetables. The fifth course was a "make your own sushi" adventure, with a lot of black squid-ink rice and barely any fish. Finally, the dessert was disjointed, but pleasant.

I understand that you get what you pay for. Some of the prior raving reviews clearly were related to a more expensive tasting menu - one I wish we were offered, by the sounds of their experience vs. ours. Oh well!
