utYpyFOjNisHl1h7lDGSGA The Yelp Christmas dinner proved to be an excellent introduction to a restaurant that immediately went onto my eat-here-again list. They did an amazing job of handling our group of 20 people. 

We were greeted with a truffle-flavored aperitif - certainly something I'd never tasted before. I started with the butternut soup, which had a really nice balance of flavors. Next came the parmesan risotto stuffed into a miniature pumpkin (complete with a very smart hat) - an interesting and well-done combination of flavors and textures. The cheese plate was a bit disappointing - in anticipation I had imagined up something much more impressive than what came. 

I will have fond memories of that salted carmel creme brûlée for a long, long time.
