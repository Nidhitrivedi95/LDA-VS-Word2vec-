SFnrHuVFSNiondFVUBLJZQ The dessert crepe here with bananas and almonds is one of the top three desserts I've had in my life.  My husband and I stumbled across it in 2010 and purposely sought it out on this trip, now with our 2-year-old.  It lived up to the memory we had of it, and even our toddler loved it.  We didn't try the meal crepes, but we can't say enough about the dessert crepes here.  We will go out of our way to eat here every time we come to Montreal.
