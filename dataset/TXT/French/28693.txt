eJ9L40jm5VOXCIq7xs9kQw Don't even get me started because I will just rave and rave. A group of six and we all ordered different entrees and tried one anothers. The lamb, the duck, the lobster stew and the chicken were so dang amazing. But listen to me when I say get the chicken. It had melted Brie cheese and my goodness it was THE best thing I have ever tasted. The presentation was beautiful and the price was so worth it! Service wasn't bad but that was because they were super packed on a saturday night. Creme Brûlée was the best I have ever had! Thank you Bonaparte and we will definitely be coming back with every trip to Montreal!
