klzCMxmhrHWZeNseS4GKFg Perfectly suited to the splendid village feel that permeates through Thistle Street, Cafe Marlayne is surely as close as you can possibly get to a rustic French Bistro in Scotland. Tiny, with tables crammed together, barely legible hand-written menus, and a grumpy, garlic munching chef swigging wine from the bottle in the kitchen. It's all an illusion of course, and this carefree rustic charm is in fact carefully constructed with almost military precision, but in some ways that makes it more impressive.

I get the impression the menu changes weekly or perhaps daily, but if the duck with apples is still on I can heartily recommend it. The food's not even all that expensive which comes as a pleasant surprise, and you get a basket of bread thrown in for free.

Only downside, that isn't a fault of the restaurant at all, is that there were some very irritating punters in on our visit. All had South East / Home Counties accents, and talked loudly and obnoxiously in tones that belied the arrogance, humourlessness, and lack of self-awareness that you would expect from them.

It was quite comical however, when the drunken trustafarians at the table next to us had their credit cards declined. I wouldn't fancy washing the dishes to pay the bill on a busy night like that.
