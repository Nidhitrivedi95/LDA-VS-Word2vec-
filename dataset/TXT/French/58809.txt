rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w Fantastique--Le Cirque at Las Vegas is a very Paris inspired interior.  Something I would expect from Sirio Maccioni a reincarnation of the venerable and amazing Le Cirque.  The Foie Gras was amazing, flawless.  The food was entirely fresh and the service was professional and nice.  A good environment topped off with a great wine makes for a spectacular evening.

Buen Provecho!
