4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw The food here is exquisite. I've been multiple times; I come here every time I'm in Vegas. The service is great, the food is great, the ambiance is great. The restaurant is pretty expensive but completely worth it. Absolutely a great place to be when you feel like dressing fancy and having a classy evening on the Strip.
