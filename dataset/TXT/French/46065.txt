mwZrxaSiSvMaRo9dMdBDAg I finally got to try this restaurant after passing it for years. We were a group of about 15. Despite the name this is a great place for a group. There was an ever larger group near us. They can separate the groups with curtains. 

No disappointments. The service was great. Pizza as a starter had an excellent crust. The Oso Buco de cerf was amazing, on a bed or risotto. The only thing a little weird was the chimicuri on the side. The three chocolates for desert was very good, but too much after such a big meal.

Bring your own wine helps keep the bill down.

I will be back.
