Yp9w4nhUowBU_IS_StFXbQ Perfect Brunch spot!! The Wynn is always beautiful , and when I can make a chance to get out there I go for it. So when I was invited to my girlfriends Birthday Brunch today I took the opportunity !! 

I tried the Duck Confit and Frisée Salad with Maui Onions that were reduced in red wine! I believe there was hazelnuts in it for added texture . 

For some extra veggies I wanted to try to farro cooked with root vegetables which went very nicely with the salad. 

Emily was our server and was very accommodating as was the bussers and runners. 

The GM was kind enough to walk us out to the patio to take pictures of our group , which was a kind gesture with a group of our size.

The outside areas of Wynn are just as tasteful as the inside, and I was just in awe of how beautiful everything was.
