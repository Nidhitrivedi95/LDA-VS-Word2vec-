6GCbZASjMnAPYBWLc_z30g It has been awhile since I've been to a Mimi's Cafe. I think it's going to be a long time before I come back. Service was good but the portions, menu, and prices have taken a turn for the worst. Very small OJ to go along with the removal of muffins from the breakfast entrees mean way less for my money. They previously brought a pot for coffee I believe. It's just generally not as good as I remember. Don't waste your time.
