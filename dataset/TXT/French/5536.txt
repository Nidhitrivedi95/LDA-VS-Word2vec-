3jKUbhGSjFTv5jZ0wnW0xA We were in Montreal for a total of 10 hours and decided to catch dinner at les deux gamins before heading home. My friends and I ordered the braised lamb shank, the beef hanger steak and the cornwall chicken. For me, the lamb shank lacked flavor and was underwhelming. I could barely make out most of the side veggies because of the heavy bbq sauce. My friends enjoyed both the beef and the chicken, noting that both were perfectly cooked and accompanied by complimenting sides.
