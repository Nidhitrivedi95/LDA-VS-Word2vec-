MdjIl105vqCYUGKFSUVytA I visited Colette for my birthday brunch a few Saturdays back in August. Great menu, beautiful presentation and delicious food. We had the pancakes, turkey sandwich and omelette. Something as small as picking up the phone after one ring, and treating us to champagne and dessert for my birthday makes all the difference. This experience will surely put Colette at the top of my list for future event venues!
