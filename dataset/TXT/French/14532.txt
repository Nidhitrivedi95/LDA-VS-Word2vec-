Granted we were a party of 7, it was a pretty slow night, and dinner still took well over 3 hours with better than an hour separating salads from entrees.  The the service was generally courteous but overall marginal; we were repeatedly visited by random people bringing correct and incorrect dishes in no particular order, not expected at this price point.  One of our wines was corked, and of course they replaced it with apologies, but overall I would say that Bouchon, Fleur de Lis, Olives, Canaletto, Fiamma, Craftsteak, and probably dozens of others would be a better use of time and money.

On the positive side, it was nice and quiet and unhurried except for one screaming toddler that nobody seemed to want to address, and the food was pretty good even by high-end Las Vegas restaurant standards.
