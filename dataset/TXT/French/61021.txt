SFnrHuVFSNiondFVUBLJZQ I visited this place a few years ago when I had the craving for fondue. Returned and was happy to find that the place still existed. Yes, it's a total tourist trap - but one that doesn't gouge folks then delivers poor food. The cheese fondue selection was sparse but pretty solid and combined with a half liter of wine, meant a splendid albeit lingering lunch. Highly recommend eating on the third floor which had a nicer atmosphere to it. The cheese fondue filled us up, so sadly we didn't have enough space for the meat fondue, which I remembered from last time, was divine and had the superb bonus of drinking the 'soup' after you had finished cooking all your meat in it.
