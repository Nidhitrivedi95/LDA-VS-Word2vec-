_cjPEH9wXhKS-HQe_U3M4Q By far one of my favourite place in the city for french bistro. If you are a fan of french cooking because you appreciate the art of making a good classical french sauce, this place should do. Is it michelin? No but I have brought my family and friends here on numerous occasion because they do the basics like the confit and bourguignon better than a lot of places that I have been to with that controversial 3-star rating system that Toronto restaurants will probably never gather enough attention to earn. They introduced and made me fall in love with the cassoulet (I'm a meat lover) especially in combination with the wine offerings available which is impressive to say the least. Want to impress someone on a first date but don't quite want that auberge over-the-top type atmosphere but still want to eat a meal I'm sure will at least put a smile on Keller? La select will do. Having said that, no need to try their special event (i.e. valentines) menus, just stick to a la carte because quite frankly, their bone marrow is bigger than black hoofs and you're gonna miss it ordering their prix fixe.
