xcmmTXhuMx2fZF2Bt69F4w I love staying in bakery square when traveling on business because of the vibe and having many great bars, restaurants close by. I have always wanted to try this place because of the great reviews - and everyone I speak with recommends it. Every time I have gone there it's been packed and I couldn't get in. Great neighborhood location, cool spot. 
I finally got in and it was well worth the wait. I started with a great Belgian beer / they've got a wide selection, and the arugula salad with goat cheese, roasted butternut squash, sunflower seeds.  Awesome and just the right portion. 
For my meal I went with the Mousel Frite Fromage. They are known for their mussels so I had to try them out. They were great. Right size, cooked perfect in a beer, shallot, bacon and blue cheese sauce. I could have made a meal out of the bread and sauce alone. 
Everyone in the place seemed to be having a great time, and every plate that went out looked delicious. I will definitely be back.
