jaSowNITPRRCYpPb3_pjdA Let me start by saying I do like Andres and will be back for dinner.
Sharrie had the Madame and it was quite tasty. She asked for the yoke to be hard and even sending it back never happened. The potatoes were greasy and under seasoned. 
I had the Andre burger with an egg on it. Again                           it was under seasoned but quite tasty.
Service seemed confused and not the most personable. Lots of personnel but no one asked if we been there before or offer any interaction except for the basic service.
With all that said I still want to try dinner there, in hopes that is where they excel.
