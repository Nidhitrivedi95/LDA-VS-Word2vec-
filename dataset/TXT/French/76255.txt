Yp1swb-8pO8i-6-jaK2tsA I went there today for first time and I totally love it! I got the Royale Turkey sandwich which it was very good, the corn chowder was amazing and the cream brûlée was out of this world. Ernesto the server was very fast and and helpful even he was busy with other tables. I highly recommend this location if you want homemade style food and good service.
