They specialize in open faced sandwiches, have a pretty decent wine and cocktail list and serve Illy coffee.

The lamb tartine is well made, served with hummus. I love their beet salad, a perfect refresher. 

However, my favourite would be the brunch tartine, basically like eggs Benedict with smoked salmon. Delish!

Service was spot on and the tab, well a bit pricey but worth it.
