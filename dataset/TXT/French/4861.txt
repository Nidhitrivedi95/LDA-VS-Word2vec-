33Tr0eRki1Yamzleu4GMdw Super disappointed with my first experience here, but let me mention the positives first:

- Great atmosphere
- The food was really good

My disappointment stems from ordering a decaf iced americano. I asked the person if they could make their drinks decaf and she said that they could so I ordered it. I have a sensitivity to caffeine that is heart related - especially to the caffeine content of coffee - so I always order my drinks decaffeinated. Anyway, I got my drink first so I started drinking it and noticed after about 5 minutes that my heart rate had increased dramatically. I wear a heart monitor and it jumped over 30 beats. I knew that the drink had caffeine in it. 
By that time, I had gotten my food so I decided to eat and not drink any more of the coffee. The food was great, by the way. When I was on my way out, I went to the person who had taken my order and made my drink and told her about my sensitivity and that I didn't think the drink was decaf. She was adamant that she used decaf to make it, but the reaction I had to it makes me question that. I have never had the same type of reaction to decaf - I only get this reaction if I accidentally ingest caffeine. There were other customers around so I didn't want to argue or cause a scene. I just wanted it to be remade as decaf, but that wasn't offered. She did offer herbal tea or a refund, but I wasn't looking for either of those so I left. 

Unfortunately, I won't be back.
