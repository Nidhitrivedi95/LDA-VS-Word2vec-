rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Tables were covered with thick white paper. Bread was served directly onto the paper cover. Hope it was replaced after previous customers. You can get the same quality of paper cover at the Macaroni Grill. At least there they write on it so you know you got a new cover. No bread plates, you had to keep putting your bread onto the table cover. The bread was a fancy woven design so had lots of crust and not much bread inside. If you want salt or pepper you have to ask for it, no shakers on the table. The waiter comes over and grinds the salt like they do pepper. Guess it is unacceptable to salt and pepper your own food. Fish served with the head on. French style? My wife thought the menu was rather limited and really did not find anything she liked. My daughter did not like it at all as it did not come across as a "fancy" restaurant. She had steak and just barely was I able to stop her from asking for A-1 Sauce. She thought the steak was dry. The sound was pretty bad as there is little if any thought to sound control. Voices echo off the walls and if you want you can eavesdrop on conversations across the room.

Unless you are really into "authentic" French food, I would not recommend this place.
