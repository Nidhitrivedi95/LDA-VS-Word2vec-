O3OH5IEFMPtz7mPKakPZ3Q This was our second time coming to this restaurant and both times it was almost completely empty. 

The food quality is 10/10. We ordered the sea bass, scallop teramoto, chicken and beef fried rice, truffle edamame, and the chawamushi. They were all packed with flavor and quality that made us melt. My favorite was the scallop teramoto and the chawamushi. It's hard to find quality chawamushi and this place has the best I've had in the Vegas. Definitely want to try the uni chawamushi next time. 

The service was nothing spectacular. Our server just took our order and brought us our food. Left us alone for most of the time, which isn't a bad thing. 

I wonder why they didn't have a lot of customers. Maybe it was the time of day we went or the location. It's located in a small complex with about one other store open nearby. There was a pretty decent sized parking lot with only a few cars parked. So I guess there's never a problem with parking. 

The only complaint I would have, is that the beef in the fried rice was hard and was not seasoned. So that was a bummer. But even though the food portions were pretty small, it was able to fill us up pretty quickly.
