htQgj-ANQpZGpIpkkrEmyQ Arrived at Inspire for a quick brunch on a weekend and it was already half occupied within 15 minutes of the opening time. 

We got the Duck Confit Frites, the Beef Salad, and the Chicken Waffle. 

The Duck Fries were so good! It was also recommended by our waitress. She mentioned that it was one of the signature dishes. Chicken Waffle wasn't bad either. The Salad was surprising filling and delicious. 

Want to come back to try their Udon on their dinner menu!
