SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ We went here for date night. We were sat at a table in a sweet little room in one of their houses. The decor reminded me of my great grandmothers living room with a quaint bookshelf and a few old-school portraits hanging on the walls. My 14oz free range pork chop was to die for. Perfectly cooked medium paired with red potatoes and a creamy broccolini  rapini. We finished dinner with the salted caramel bread pudding which we are still talking about! Our server was sweet and attentive. I recommend this place to friends and family all the time. Sit on the patio if the weather is permitting. The shrubbery and cascading trees with bistro string lighting provide a memorable ambiance.
