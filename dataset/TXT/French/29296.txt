eUjDWzbQ6eLZy0uELEOa9Q On our first night in Toronto, I decided it would be nice to explore the Distiller District area. Seems like a chill place to walk around and enjoy a nice dinner. And it was, but we paid for it. Pricey! 

I ordered the blackened cod...and I could barely manage to find the pieces on my plate. Oh, I should mention I was starving because we drove up from Cleveland and had been saving our stomachs for a nice Toronto dinner. As a dietitian, I'm big on portion control, but this portion size of cod was just plain cheap. My protein portion was definitely smaller than the size of my palm (and I have small palms, mind you)...or even a deck of cards, if you will. Needless to say, that meal alone wouldn't have filled me up. Thank goodness I had a beer by my side to help fill the void. Another dish would have cost me an arm. 

My boyfriend got a pork chop dish, which was more substantial. He said it was ok, but didn't really rave about it. 

For over $25 a pop, you're paying more for the scenery and the atmosphere than the food. I can see why people like it there- it's beautiful and a nice place but if you're looking for food..I'd say don't eat here.
