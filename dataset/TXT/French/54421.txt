rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw LOVED this new French Brasserie at Aria! We went there twice during our stay, it was a very good location for us since it was right next to the second floor entrance of Sky Suites. The bar and lounge opens early evening so it was very convenient for us to grab some drinks and bar food. 

During our bar times, we tried a few cocktails, they all tasted so good and strong. They use classic martini glasses, which is very upscale and elegant. Hubby tried French onion soup, it was very delicious and comforting. 

Our dinner was AMAZING, very slow cause it's a French restaurant, but everything came out perfectly, we really enjoyed our Christmas Day dinner! 

Starters:
French bread with butter: fresh and yummy.

Escargots pastry puff: very tender and flavorful escargots, but I never liked pastry puff too much, I always get very nervous if I have to eat carbs. Hubby loved it. 

Entrees:
Filet rare plus with French fries: a beautiful cut of filet cooked to perfection, just the way hubby liked it, housemade sauce was so good, I loved the French fries, the very best I have ever tasted! 

Branzino head and bones off, with onions and fingerling potatoes: FANTASTIC fish, so fresh and tender, flavors were very well balanced, loved it! 

Side of mushrooms: rich flavors, very delicious!

Dessert creme brûlée: it was chilled in stead of warm, very soft and sweet, so yummy. 

Bottle of reserved Perrier was so good, espresso martini was strong and tasty, hubby liked his espresso shots too. 

 It was a great dinner, they had a photographer taking photos of dining people, loved the photos she took, very cute! Definitely one of the best dining experiences we have ever had! 

Just love this restaurant and bar, think we will eat and drink here every time we stay at Aria!
