QeFsIMcIFIJcOrpthYL8jg Modavie was the first place we ate at while in Montreal; we were starving and hot from all the walking around. I quickly checked their Yelp reviews and decided we'll go inside and have a nice cocktail and some grub. There are many places to eat in Old Montreal, but Modavie being directly on the corner of all the action of Saint Paul spoke to me. We decided on having a seat at the high seats next to the window, with a view of all the people going by. It's a very elegant French restaurant without the need for getting dressed up all fancy. We checked out the wine menu and we both went with a glass of Riesling.  

We decided we'll pick a few things to start and share with each other. We ordered the poutine which I was informed by our server is their version of junk food. It's basically fries with cheese curds, gravy and braised lamb. It was a large portion, tasted really good. We both enjoyed it very much and would come back for it again. We also ordered the Beet Salad along with a side of fries.
This place was great for a late lunch not sure how dinner is but our food and service was great. We left with content full stomachs with enough carbs to fuel our walk around Old Montreal.
