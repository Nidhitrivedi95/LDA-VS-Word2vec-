mnn--vaYHtNyBNYFYBFIog An absolutely amazing experience! This place not only greets you with a Chef's compliments with a mousse that will only be the beginning of a journey. Business dinner, not a loud place, amazing service! 

I had the foie gras as a first course and I can say it was exquisite, but when the main course came, a rack of lamb incredibly well presented was short to the taste! Best ever!

For dessert I had poached pear, on par with the rest. Everything we all had was part of a journey to a succulent gourmet experience.
