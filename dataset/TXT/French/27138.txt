dd3GZs6zW2t7BM0cbxAzvg I'm a big fan of Shamez and his head chef Brook. They've recently opened this new location on Queen St. W. in order to expand the market they can reach with their flair for French Bistro cuisine.

For those who know the brand as well as the new comers: you'll love the new joint. Open and airy with high ceilings, a skylight, and an original full-length brick wall to one side, you simply can't deny the charm of this eclectic space. The building served as a barn and was built in 1880 and a lot of that vintage design has been carried over. The art and posters are as quirky as ever, and the atmosphere is open yet intimate. This is helped by the small two-seater tables and completely mismatching chairs dotting the back of the restaurant (where you have seated meals).

That area is roughly similar in size as the original restaurant, but the new space has an amazing entrance that houses a long curved bar around which you'd mingle, and a totally open kitchen that showcases the gastronomic magic of this restaurant.

Of course, in the end, that's why you're there. The food is delicious. The menu is similar to the old establishment but there are some new items too. Expect to see your favorite game meats.

Thus far, I've only tried one item off of the brunch menu: eggs benedict on crispy bacon combined with horseradish sitting on rye bread with a mixed green salad. This is a must eat dish. The open kitchen design is brilliant in the fact that it lets you sense the aromas of your dish and build up mouth watering anticipation before being able to dig in.

Mimosas with fresh orange juice helped wash down the delectable meal and we walked away not feeling overly stuffed or light in the pocket. $50 (ex. tip) for 2.

I highly recommend La Palette (South) along with its sister restaurant in Kensington Market.
