jo4KmAqlZ7vxjHIP7IIkAw i visited the cafe for brunch on a sunday.

meal ordered: their regular coffee, and bacon and egg "sandwich" which actually was not a sandwich but like a bacon and egg omelet made from a mashed up sandwich, it also had a slice of honeydew, pineapple, one strawberry. the plate also had potatoes on it and i munched it down with ketchup. 

food: rating of 5: an absolutely delicious lunch, potatoes had good seasoning and were fried very nicely, the omelet had tons of flavour, fruit wash fresh. even the coffee was surprisingly fresh and delicious.

service; rating of 3: a little slow, and somewhat cold, but nothing that could be considered terrible, but it just wasn't good enough for a "5" rating.

portion size: rating of 5 very good portion size, there was a lot of bacon, 3 eggs (i think?), the coffee was not that big, but breakfast was perfect sized.

price: rating of 4 his was reasonable the "sandwich" was around 12$ and coffee was around 2$ .. all in reasonable..

ambiance:  rating is 4 I usually don't add this section in reviews because I usually pay attention to food (as all of you should :) ) but this place had tons of unique art pieces, and the place was very interesting overall, not to mention the somewhat interesting baldwin village.

overall: great place for brunch, I can't say that it is as good as the leslieville places that I have been to, but for baldwin village it is actually quite nice.... good food, good price, nice environment and just a good little place to to brunch
