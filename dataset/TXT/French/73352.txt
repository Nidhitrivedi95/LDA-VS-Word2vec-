xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g Never again!  Except maybe for a cocktail.  While the views are fantastic, the service and the kitchen does not measure up to high-end Las Vegas standards.  The menu is truly pedestrian with no imagination whatsoever.  Prices are targeted for lame high-rollers and we pity the poor punters that take their significant others there for a once-in-a-lifetime celebratory occasions.

My wife & I joined her clients in from out of town with another couple for a birthday dinner.  We opted for wine-by-the-glass, but the list was MBA/CPA optimized for maximum gouging.   The menu was strangely limited, although each category - beef, fish and non-beef - about 6 selections each, was hardly stimulating.  New York Strip, rib eye, rabbit, halibut.  Yawn.  Started off with a vichyssoise that tasted like it came from a can.  The taste of the French bread was terrible!  Local Vietnamese sandwich shops offer fresh French bread with better texture & taste.  Then we waited - for an hour before the mains were served.  The average entre price is $50.  Salads are $12.  With so many fabulous restaurants in greater Las Vegas, we're loath to return.  All the view in the world didn't make the dinner experience any better.

Semi-retired food snob.  He doth protest too much.
