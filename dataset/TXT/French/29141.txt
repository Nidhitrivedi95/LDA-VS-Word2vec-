epvLkQNL6MOvk3s6JlTntA I love crepes and I expected pricey and gourmet.  But I was disappointed here...I dined here alone in the evening on a Tuesday night, anticipating a scrumptious meal and some comfortable alone time.  Well, I got the alone time, not so much the scrumptious meal.  I wanted a cheese stuffed egg-y crepe but I got a dried out buckwheat tortilla.  Too bad.
The $7 side salad was lovely.  And the Amish Ham and Gouda cheese were good, but the actual crepe....so disappointing.  If you're going to call yourself a creperie...don't serve a dried out tortilla and call it a crepe.
