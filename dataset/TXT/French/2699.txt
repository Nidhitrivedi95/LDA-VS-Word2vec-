0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g Sorry, Picasso, but Stack was better.
Anyway, on to the review.  Roger was our server (the lead server out of a team of servers).  My wife and I both had the Prix Fixe 3 course meal.  The food was well prepared, service was beyond exceptional.  Going to Picasso is an event meal....don't get me wrong, the food is really good (see my review of Stack) and the service,is exactly what you expect in a high end gourmet restaraunt. A very special experience.
