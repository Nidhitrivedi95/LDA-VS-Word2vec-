9ot8oInkYZTt6wkkGe__vQ The best restaurant in the city. I've tried all of O&B's restaurants and they are all great, but this French cuisine is on another level.

For every anniversary, my one and only request is to dine at this restaurant. The atmosphere is incredibly romantic, service is always top notch, and the food is absolutely amazing. Every bite melts!
