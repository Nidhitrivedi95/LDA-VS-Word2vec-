EPb3FWs3mxQLUjGeMNP0SQ Great Brunch place right in the heart of Old Montreal. The interior decor is beautiful and perfect for any special occasion. The fried chicken and waffles during brunch hours is a must have for sure. They even have a rooftop bar at the top, just ask the waitress where to go! :)
