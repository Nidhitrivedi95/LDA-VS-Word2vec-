XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q Intro:
I was floating on a cloud the entire time.

Food:
We had the six course tasting menu:
Avocado pure in a thin herb gele and olive oil flavored curd cheese:  AMAZING.
Shaved white truffles and potatoes with olive oil, topped with foie gras carpaccio:  AMAZING.
Custard of Gorgonzola with a pear vierge and sage tomatoes:  Decent.
Pan-fried sea bass with a lemon grass foam and stewed baby leeks:  AMAZING
Grilled Kobe beef with matsutake mushroom, parsley tempura, horseradish mustard:  AMAZING.  I have to admit, I was a little fearful of the idea of the mushroom and tempura with my Kobe, but it all complimented each other nicely.
Pineapple with hazelnut-praline and orange Pekoe tea sorbet:  I didn't have a chance to try this.  At this point, I was feeling like a genuine fatty.

Service:
It was perfect, just the right amount of attention and knowledge without it being so overbearing.

Ambiance:
Exquisite.  Very clean and minimal.  Brought back memories of Paris.

Overall:
This is truly an experience.  It's worth every shiny penny.
