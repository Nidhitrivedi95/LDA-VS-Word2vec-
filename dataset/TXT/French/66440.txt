uP3H5bcsiTXM0k0xQhRndg What a find! I was visiting from Boston and looking for a quaint place for a great meal before I left the city. WOW. 

Small menu and not much variety - but this place is all quality vs. quantity. Think rich, flavorful and DELICIOUS. I had read other reviews before selecting Le Robin Square so I had an idea of what I wanted. I had a hard time choosing - so I got 2 different entrees. I ordered the Mac n Cheese with truffle oil and ham and I got the Pork Belly. Both are substantial and I brought some leftovers back with me. If you can take a friend or two and share plates, you win big. 

Small wine list too but good selection and variety of simple red and whites. Service was super friendly and good. So genuine. You could put this food in an upscale setting with fancy settings and staff and pull it off. That's what's so great about this place - no pretense, lots of flavor and a pleasant atmosphere to soak it all in - one bite at a time.
