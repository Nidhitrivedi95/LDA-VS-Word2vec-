Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA So impressed with the food and service.   The view is breathtaking as well it is located on the rooftop of the Mandalay Bay Hotel.

Colorado Lamb Loin.  Pomme Anna, stuffed piquillo pepper and herb salad.   Lamb was cooked just at that edge of rare and medium rare and achieves my top marks.

Roasted Maine Lobster au Curry with basmati rice.    Lobster was perfectly cooked.   Zesty sauce 

Strawberry rhubarb was so different.  I have never had rhubarb by itself,  but it was so tart and delicious. 

Our server Kevin was personable and told us interesting stories about some of their celebrity clients.  He even brought us out a pair of fresh baked Madelines with "happy anniversary " written on the plate.
