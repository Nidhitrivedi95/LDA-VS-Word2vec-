O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q Food was good. Had the romaine salad prepared table-side. 16-oz dry aged bone in rib eye and the ratatouille as a side. Good stuff except service was a little slow and the guy who set our silverware and took away our plates was more accessible than our waiter, who I don't remember seeing after we placed our order.
