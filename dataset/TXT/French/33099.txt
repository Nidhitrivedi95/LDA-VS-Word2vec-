HGDY8ZQkCmZ_d_OR_glSgA Wonderful French restaurant in Old Montreal with delicious, simple, fresh, authentic food and drinks at good prices. We especially loved the French onion soup, the sun dried tomato pasta, the duck and spinach cannelloni, and the creme brûlée (plus the bread that came with the meal!). The staff were just lovely--some of the most helpful, attentive, and friendly I've ever encountered. Highly recommend this place!
