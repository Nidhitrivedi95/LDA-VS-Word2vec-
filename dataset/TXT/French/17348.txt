9iy6scMRbs5ue41XRLGEkw My husband and I came here excited to try this place. We loved every thing. The food was great, the place was very romantic and beautiful, very pretty. We came here at about 7:30. They had live music which was also very good. The staff was very welcoming, sweet and friendly. We loved the steak tartare very well presented with the quail egg on top, we also got the escargo which was delicious. Our main dishes were veal (my husband) and lamb shank (mine) which was also beautifully presented and delicious. Loved the desserts! They also have very good coffee. The meal was a very good and satisfying one. Very memorable we are definitely coming back. Loved the staff. I noticed some of the bad reviews on here were for what I think ridiculous or silly reasons, however to each their own. We loved this place and our experience was great.
