jLxeBgWhLRbII2ACkgH1Sg UPDATE 8/12.. I haven't been there in a while and today I decided to stopped by, huge disappointment! They changed owners and the quality is gone with them.. bought couple of pastries and honestly I think Smith's has better bakery than them.. Using fake "whipped cream" in a French bakery is sin! Yeap, it's the end of an amazing place.. for good. 




First time today, I took home a Montmartre crepe and 2 pastries: choc raspberry mouse and a peach tart (that I still need to try later on). The crepe was absolutely delicious!! What a pleasant surprise this place is close home :) The crepe was light and fluffy and the filled was perfectly balanced and flavorful. After, I had the chocolate raspberry mouse. It was perfect! Not too sweet, perfect size. I can't wait to try the other dishes they have. I recommend this place 100%!! Love it :)
