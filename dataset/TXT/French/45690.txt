mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q Chef Steve, Simon, Emmanuel, wow.  flawless as always.  This is our favorite restaurant other than my husband's food -- and even he's got to take a break sometime.  I knew this would be the perfect place to go before (& after) the Madonna concert.  Monsieur Robuchon went to see Madonna, too, and afterwards we were lucky enough to get to catch up with him.  A huge team is in from Paris -- assuring that the service continues to get better and better -- as does the food.  If you've not been -- this should be tops on your list -- that is, if you think diners, sushi counters and oyster bars are the bomb.  If you don't, then you probably won't get it -- and that would be a damned shame.
