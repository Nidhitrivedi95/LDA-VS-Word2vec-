rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w I was hesitant to eat at Le Cirque because I saw Chilean Sea Bass on its menu 3 years ago. Two years ago, it had vanished so I dined on some fine turbot and wondrous vodka + granny smith atoms gelee though the gold plated langoustines they accompanied I had to send back because they were too fishy. They didn't mind, and didn't charge me. This trip, I was persuaded to try Le Cirque again and indeed their monkfish sounded intriguing. I've only had monkfish once before, at Le Bernardin  in 2010 and figured that was as high a standard as a dish could get. Le Cirque hit it out of the park. Better than Le Bernardin, considered by people who do such considerings, the best seafood restaurant in the world? Yes. They also gave me a liquid egg. I loathe liquid eggs. I love hard boiled eggs, omelets, quiches and other such concoctions but fried, poached or otherwise liquidized eggs are the enemy of my palate. But Le Cirque somehow made it palatable. Maybe the best service I have experienced, in a city full of great service. Wine pairing was serviceable, nothing of genius. Great food, wondrous service and serviceable booze- nobody bat's 1.000, even in Vegas.
