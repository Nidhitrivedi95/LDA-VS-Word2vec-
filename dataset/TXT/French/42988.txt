LQ_gYNs5E10IGFE0NOyD7A This is a fantastic spot right in the middle of old town Scottsdale.  The food was great as was the atmosphere on the back patio. There were many interesting menu items, all of which were very, very good.  I shared a number of entrees with friends and so was able to taste the steak, salmon, fried chicken, and pork sandwich.  Everything was very delicious.  I think I'm a little jaded to the prices normally charged in Scottsdale, but the meal here was an insanely good value.  Even the wines were good and priced reasonably.  I will absolutely be back.
