eDtBCZDo92LqBCIfE45hhg Had an outstanding business dinner experience.  Had a salad to start, the halibut entree, and the Fidel's Choice for dessert (no idea why they called it that, but it was great.  Perhaps the Chef is named Fidel - dunno).  We sat on the "patio" - really the alley which is actually really nice.  Beautiful stone walls, nicely lit, had great weather.  Service was awesome.  Our group had a French pinot noir and a pinot blanc which were both really nice.  Everything was perfect.
