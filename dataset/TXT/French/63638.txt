t1mR_Zff6Dqv1TueE2JLEA I went to the Sultan's Tent for the Moroccolicious dinner on Saturday with some friends. I've actually been there several years ago and absolutely hated it. I think they changed their chef or something because the food was much better, almost authentic Moroccan. 

I had the duck salad which as okay, I'm not sure about the duck. I liked the mafftoul which my friend ordered. My entree was the chicken Marrakesh, the couscous really well cooked with spices and all. I loved it. For desert, creme brulee, you can't go wrong there. 

All that for $25, i think its a good deal. By the way, the setting is really beautiful but a little too dark. The servers were very friendly. I'm definitely going back to check out the BerBer lounge.
