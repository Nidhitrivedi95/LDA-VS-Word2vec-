4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw We dined here recently on the 16th, a Saturday night, and it was absolutely fantastic.  We didn't have reservations, and were told that an inside table was about a 30minute wait, versus 90minutes for outdoor seating.  We chose to dine indoors.  I know that everyone is raving about the balcony seating, but the inside dining room was well appointed and perfect for a cozy dinner.  The bottles of their wines-by-the-glass sat close by at a serving station, and the server was generous with offering a taste before ordering a full glass.  The baguette in the bag was delicious and came accompanied by both butter as well as a yummy carrot compote.  The caesar salad was simple yet quite delicious.  But their famous steak frites are simply to die for.  I had the steak bordelaise, which came smothered in sweet caramelized onions and a red wine reduction, together with a mountain of frites that looked like shredded homemade potato chips -- airy and melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  It was simply too much food to finish so I couldn't try any of their desserts.  Next time! And oh boy, absolutely no question about it there WILL be a next time! Each time I'm in Vegas, baby!
