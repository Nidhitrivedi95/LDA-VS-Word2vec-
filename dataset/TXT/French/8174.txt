4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I'm sorry for those reviewers that had a bad experience...ours was very satisfying and pleasant.  We were seated right away (we didn't sit outside).  The wait staff was friendly and attentive. I couldn't tell who was our real server because we were waited on my 4 different people--but all of them pleasant and our order came out fine, so I assume there was good communication between them. 

 We had the escargot appetizer--the snails were big and meaty, and the parsley garlic butter was great--not salty! The bread was fresh and hot.  He had the steak au poivre--the server was very helpful in suggesting the temp for both of our steak--i went with the filet with Merlot butter reduction. Perfect and flavorful.  No complaints from me in the slightest.  Very happy. It was a good last night in Vegas.  It would have been better if I won some $$, but....
