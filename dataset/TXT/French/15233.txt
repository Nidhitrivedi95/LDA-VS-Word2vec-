63qPRnFAjxtchnSTWBxwbw I came all the way to the restaurant because of the good comments on Yelp, but found their Poutine a completely overrated overpriced dish. 

I ordered a Poutine with pulled pork on top, it costs me almost 14 dollars. The size is not even large. I would only pay 7 dollars for this.
