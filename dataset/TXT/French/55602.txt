rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Wow, I don't even know where to begin.  My girls brought me here for a fancy dinner for my bachlorette party and I had been excited about it alllll week.  Boy was I disappointed....not to blame them seeing that this was my pick but I really had high hopes for this place, for many reasons.  First, I dont think I'll ever make it to French Laundry in this lifetime so am more than happy to settle for Bouchon.  Secondly, it had rave reviews on yelp.  So I am not really sure what went wrong?  I ordered gnocchi which was very flavorful and rich in the first few bites.  However, as I kept eating, the grease just became very overwhelming that it was starting to not sit well with my stomach.  It was simply too heavy.  What threw me off is it isn't the type of creamy pasta gnocchi that I was expecting or use to, it was more pan fried to a crisp over oil.  

So I thought it was only my dish and I tried many of my friend's other dishes, which included steak and frites and sturgeon fish.  I wasn't impressed with any of those either.

The steak was very average (tho the fries were delicious but I'm easily impressed with fries).  One word of advice tho, all the temperature are cooked one less than what you ask.  My friend asked for medium and it came out med rare, another order med well and it came out med, third friend ordered med rare and it was super bloody.  My other friend commented that her fish was a little dry.

I was pretty disappointed with the meal  but luckily, the good company more than made up for it.  The one upside is the bread before our meal was delicious, as everyone said it would be.  Also, we arrived at dinner at 9pm and many of their dishes, including the specials, were all out.  If you want to get a good pick of the menu, go early!  The food is fresh so it will run out.  Otherwise, the ambiance and service is about what I expect, I just wish the food was too.
