The service is as close to perfect as you would like. The staff is friendly all around, they are all willing to share a little wisdom when it comes to selecting your meal.
The menu is very small but incredibly creative, with extensive use of local produce and meats. I started with piglet risotto with shavings of foie gras, like nothing I have ever tasted. It was very rich and full of interesting flavors. I followed with a main course of the surf and turf, a perfectly prepared lobster claw ( shelled ) over a rare piece of beef tenderloin all on top of an artichoke purée that was heavenly. My wife's meal was a starter of seared scallops, very good but less interesting, followed by a seared cod and foie gras, that was also heavenly. 
We wrapped up the meal with a cheese plater picked by the waiter that was the perfect topper. 

Needless to say I do recommend the restaurant, but a warning, I found it a little expensive and I like expensive restaurants, it comes down to value, the venue is a little lacking for the price tag.
