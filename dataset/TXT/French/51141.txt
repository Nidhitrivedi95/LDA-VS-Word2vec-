I have been to Le Bistro twice--first time was Valentine's Day 2014 and second time was directly after my fiance proposed to me--and I cannot say enough about how much I love this place.
From the food, atmosphere and most importantly, the incredibly friendly staff and owners, Le Bistro is THE perfect date night location. Both visits, our meals were superb. My fiance and I could not stop complimenting each dish as we ate them. We were also more than impressed, and could not get over how nice the owners and staff were. They even remembered us 7 months after our first visit! Now that's what I call going the extra mile. 
If you're looking for a little taste of Paris for your next date night, please visit this establishment! You will not regret it I promise! I am already counting down the days until my next visit.
