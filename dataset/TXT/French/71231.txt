xcmmTXhuMx2fZF2Bt69F4w After reading a ton of great reviews I knew I had to try this place!  Went with a friend and we started with a side salad and the mussels (which I generally don't like btw).  The wine and garlic sauce they were soaked in was so good I seriously contemplated licking the plate, and the mussels were nice and tender, not chewy or fishy- superb!  I then had the Ragù Bolognese for my main dish.  Not only was I practically too full to even touch it, but it was so rich (esp. after the mussels) that I didn't want to.  Such a shame to end the meal on a downer, but would still go back - and highly recommend this place - anyother time.
