4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw We had dinner here last night, and we enjoyed it all! It's a nice restaurant indeed! We got here when the sun had just gone down and sat on the patio. It's such nice weather, so we had to take advanctage! The lights from the hotel across the street were beautiful. Come for a nice glass of wine at least! You'll enjoy!

Our server was very professional and nice. I wish I could remember her name.
