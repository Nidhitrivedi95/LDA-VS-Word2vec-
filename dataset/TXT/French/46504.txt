By any other name would taste as sweet..." 

Mom always said to to assume makes an Ass of of U and Me and maybe she was on to something because this place confused me and I am an ass for almost letting it interfere with a fantastic dining experience.

You see I pass this place all the time on my way to work or stand near it when attempting to snag a seat at Grand Electric and I always assumed it was a French-style restaurant. Given its name and general minimalist aesthetics nothing made me think this wasn't a little French hipster joint, so imagine my surprise when I see that the menu heavily features Asian inspired lettuce wraps and awesome chicken wings.

I wasn't in the mood for nibbling... I wanted to have a full meal *pouts with arms crossed* but I put my big girl panties on, sucked it up and ordered. I guess it goes without saying but I ordered the chicken wings and they were divine. The bartender here is delightfully sharp with tons of quick wit, so if your going solo he'll make sure to keep you on your toes at the bar.

Oh an d if you are wondering about the name... Wikipedia got you covered:
The Chantecler is a breed of chicken originating in Canada and developed in the early 20th century, at the Abbey of Notre-Dame du Lac in Oka, Quebec. It is extremely cold-resistant, and is suitable for both egg and meat production.

Now you know and knowing is half the battle (GI Joe!)
