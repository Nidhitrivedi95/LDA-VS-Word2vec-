xsFJZu4nME615byZVrpMGA Gosh I am IN LOVE with this place.... Relaxed atmosphere, don't feel like I am rushed to leave, big windows letting the sun shine in. Just everything. 

When I first walked in, I was unsure of whether I walked into a hotel lobby or a coffee shop - the place is grande, with luxurious decor and couches, and was instantly welcomed with friendly staff. It even had an iPad lounge (reminded me of the airport). Half of it is a sit down place while another half is a boutique shop for Nespresso machines. I was seated in a two person table and was given cold lemon water to enjoy while browsing the menu. 

Their drink menu was clearly dedicated to coffee and it took me forever to decide on one. My boyfriend ordered the iced coffee (topped with two scoops of vanilla ice cream and chocolate bites)... yes, he was drawn by the idea of ice cream on coffee. I, on the other hand, ordered the hazelnut hot chocolate ( both priced at $7.50), Both drinks came with a mini swiss chocolate (which was delicious!) After trying both (although not the wisest choice to mix cold and hot drinks together) , I was completely satisfied with both our choices. At that time, we haven't eaten lunch yet so we ordered two entreees - the quiche with the side salad and the chicken pesto wrap with a side soup (averaged around $15/ entree). Oh.. also, glanced the menu and they had macarons for $3 (would not get because Morocco Chocolat and other specialty cafes  around the corner) and desserts such as coffee caramel brulee (hoping to during my next visit!). 


Overall the food was good (but nothing spectacular and incredibly overpriced) , but I would definitely come back to try out more of their coffee choices!
