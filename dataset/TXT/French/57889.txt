rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I've been here a few times for dinner but not for breakfast.  We came here the other day for breakfast and I had the salmon baquette and I was pretty impressed with it.  We also ordered the bignets and I was pretty amzaed with it, better then the one's over at Ralph Brennan's in Anaheim.  

The service time around was ok, he could've done better.  Regardless, we'll be back.
