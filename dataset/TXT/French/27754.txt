DOmVF9YKOvTkqjcgUwtOgQ We walking in at 4:50pm and were told that it was after 5pm so we had to have the formula 1 dinner menu. I showed her the time on my phone which was 4:50pm and she said it didn't matter.

After ordering it took 45min for the 2 salmon entrees we ordered to come out. They were both undercooked. I sent it back and it came out under cooked again, one was clearly grilled while one may have been baked. I gave them to the manager and told him I no longer wanted the entrees and to remove them from the bill.


Bill was around $77 on the paper, which was correct with the salmon entrees removed. When we gave them our card there was no option for tipping, and it simply displayed a total of $166. We canceled the transaction and that's when we started yelling.

Absolutely terrible. Very slow service, water was rarely refilled. The restaurant was not full. I will never return.

On a side note the bread and butter were very good.
