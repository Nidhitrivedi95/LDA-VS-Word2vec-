cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg This place is just magnificent!  We went here for my bachelor party, and it did not disappoint!  

Me and my boys attacked this 8-Layer Seafood cornucopia!  It had every imaginable thing from the ocean on it, with the exception of a mermaid!  

They seated us in a nice long table, although the wait did take about 30-45mins. Which as it turned out wasn't so bad, as we went to the local store, bought a couple of bottles of wine, and enjoyed it while waiting to be seated!

Once the food came out  we sorta stared at it, not really knowing how to begin tackling such a  challenge!  Guys were dropping like flies after about 1.5hours of non-stop carnage!  

Try the foie gras, its unbelievable!  They also had a "Duck in a Can"...hard to believe, but it was actually pretty good!  

All in all, a great and very memorable experience!  Very authentic, fresh food, with great service and staff!
