4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Everyone needs to go to Mon Ami Gabi!  Breakfast starts at 7:00 a.m. so I go early to get an outside patio table.  The view of the Strip plus the incredible breakfast options makes for one happy girl!  They have thin pancakes/crepes and all of the egg dishes that your heart can desire.  I usually get the egg white and turkey omelette with the tomato relish on the side.  Their coffee is tasty!
