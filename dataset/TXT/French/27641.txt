DLRpQJ6UtoQswcWpQGS7Sg This is the perfect place to go if you want to have perfectly cooked duck! We came in right before they closed for lunch but they still took us anyway! That was very sweet of them and our hungry bellies appreciated it! 

In one word: perfection. The food was beautifully presented and it was extremely tasty. The staff was very friendly. The entire restaurant has a unique take. They come from the south of France. They have a tv playing with different sports popular in France. The restaurant is elegantly decorated and I loved being there. The owner knew we were from out of town and even asked us if we needed the wifi password!

Overall very friendly, gorgeous atmosphere, tasty food! A must!
