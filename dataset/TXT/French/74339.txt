xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g We had a wonderful time. Because of traffic we were 25 minutes late (and wanting to drive by and support the Vegas tea party) but we called ahead. They were so kind and so nice about it I was floored. Also need to mention we had gone there the night before to see where they were and the man downstairs at the elevator was so nice that he insisted he take us up for a look at the view so we could see the view that we had asked about it.Kudos to Keith(I hope I remember his name correctly.)The food was lovely and fresh and the view spectacular. The lady greeter on the day said it was a good thing we were late because now we could stretch out our lunch and sit a while if we wanted and see the water show at the Bellagio across the street. We stayed and took her advise and it was so worth it. The place was technically closed but they still refolded my napkin when I got up and they took our pictures for us. All this and we were 30 min late for our opentable reservation. We had front row seats to the water show at the Bellagio without standing outside in the cold. The kitchen is amazing to look at. It is right outside the elevator.
