4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw This is my second time here and I have not visited in awhile! I remember their patio seating was lovely. However, I was here for a reservation and they seated us quickly. I loved the bread because it was great and it went well. I also ordered the escargot and I dipped it into the bread. It was perfect! I ordered a French onion soup and it was also very good! I ordered the macaroni and cheese and I would say that it is an acquired taste. The creme brûlée was to die for and I absolutely loved this. Our servers were friendly and constantly asked if we needed anything even though the place was packed. I would definitely visit here again!
