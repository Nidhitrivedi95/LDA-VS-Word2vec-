XOWTpGlGEnsOSVl9-OXjSw Incredible cafe from brunch with the pastries from patisserie rhubarbe. 

I got a special which had thinly sliced gravlox with ricotta, red cabbage and herbs. It was a perfect light brunch, and came with a bacon and cheese scone. I loved the breakfast, and the environment. Beautiful wallpaper and adorable flowers on each table. Also had great coffee! 

My friends for the grilled cheese that you dip in a soft boiled egg and the French toast that was made of a croissant. One of my favorite brunches!!
