8ciT6qjI18x9EPtOb-gqYQ A delightful treat, a scrumptious country meal, reminiscent of a park picnic. These are just a few ways I would explain a meal at Coup Des Tartes. The starters of onion tart and pate were delicious, rustic and great to share. We ordered from the summer price fix meal and found it to a great value - filet and pomme frites with a great green salad for $25..It is BYOB which I loved but my espousa was put off by the $9 corkage fee, I thought is was the best deal going bt he thought it was   pricey...either way it is BYOB so bring something you love. The place is small so you will find it cozy and your fellow dinners will be close by...Enjoy, it is a great casual dining experience.
