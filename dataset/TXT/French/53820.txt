qnFdBp12seAxwe2_iHM2bA We dined here on our last night in Montreal and we were quite delighted with the fare of flavorful food with outstanding service. It was the choice of the Concierge at the W hotel that suggested we go to his favorite restaurant. 

What's wonderful about our experience is that we chose the wine pairing with our own choosing of our food, not the usual Prixe Fix menu. For appetizers we dined on Green salad, confit shallot vinaigrette and Foie gras au torchon, date purée, figs and hazelnuts -- may I say DELICIOUS! My dinner consisted of Pacific Halibut, black beans, coriander salsa verde, spicy green olive salad. Wow, light and so full of flavor! My date dined on Veal sweetbreads, roasted grapes, sour dough panzanella, Pedro Ximenez vinaigrette. I tasted it and boy was it scrumptious.

A definite place to enjoy a taste of refined French cuisine without the pretentious aire.
