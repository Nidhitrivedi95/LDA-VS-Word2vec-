xcmmTXhuMx2fZF2Bt69F4w I went to Point Brugge with the understanding that they had the best mussels in east Pittsburgh. I'm from out of town and was looking forward to my dinner. I'm not sure I've ever seen smaller mussels served at a restaurant. The sauce was great, but it was served in a large bowl, so the broth cooled down in 5 minutes. The rest of the menu looked great, but I would never go back again. Unfortunately, my friend's salad looked better than my mussels. Also, their Web site does not have a contact e-mail, so it's hard to give them criticism that could improve their food.
