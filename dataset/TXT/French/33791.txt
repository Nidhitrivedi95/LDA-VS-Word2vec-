hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA I'm definitely a fan of the food I've tried so far. The breakfast croissant with egg and ham was flaky and buttery, simply scrumptious. The chipotle chicken sandwich melts in your mouth with just the right amount of kick. And the chocolate tart? silky and luscious! The coffee on the other hand I could have gone without, I got a white chocolate mocha and café mocha with hazelnut, neither drink made an impression. It needed more oomph in my opinion. There's also a bit of a wait for your food after you've ordered because there's only 2 of them, it took about 25 minutes for me to get out of there (there was a group of 3 ahead of me) They take pride in the quality of their food and it's really worth it in the end but I wouldn't go back unless I know I have plenty of time to spare. I wish they were open on the weekends though, it's a nice spot to have brunch with the family. I will surely be back one of these days.
