4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw My boyfriend and I were in Vegas a few months ago and we wanted to find a budget-friendly but nice dinner. I found this on yelp of course and we had a great time thanks to a little luck! The wait time to sit on the outside patio was ridiculous..over an hour wait (and this was around 8:30pm on a weeknight!!) so we opted for an inside table. Here's where the luck came in: most people sit on the patio so they can enjoy the gorgeous Bellagio fountain show during dinner. Our table, while inside, gave us the PERFECT view of the fountains and was very close to the outside patio. So throughout the whole dinner we got to enjoy the magnificent Bellagio fountain show on a beautiful summer night. My boyfriend ordered steak which was pretty good, and I ordered the fish which was okay. The fabulous view really made it a romantic and special night and this place was pretty affordable compared to most places on the strip. We were really impressed and will definitely be back on our next trip to Vegas!
