4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Again, for the second time I have been here for breakfast and love it. I had waffles with apples and cream. Delicious ! Crispy and soft to perfection. My party had mushroom omelet and it was great too. He was very polite. He mistakenly brought ham but politely changed it when told it was wrong. It was very crowded but we got a table right away! Again, I love this place.
