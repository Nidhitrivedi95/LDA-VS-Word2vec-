gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg The food is decent, nothing much to crave but good to have a drink with a friend, if it is something to be desired.  I think the only reason I go here is usually because I want to share a drink with friends, not really to eat the food.  If I wanted eat, I usually share a dish of nachos with friends but that is about it.  The restaurant is always busy and almost always crowded and busy.  Usually, I don't really see the waitress much other than when being asked what the order is and when to pay.  I'm usually not asked if things are going well or not, but probably that's because the waitress is so busy waiting on other tables and bringing food to other tables as well.  I think if there weren't such a variety of drinks, especially pitchers of drinks to share with friends, I wouldn't dine at the restaurant.
