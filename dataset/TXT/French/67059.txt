USleI8g1UVN9-9jm-b4uIg Great special occasion restaurant with fabulous food, attentive service, and ridiculous wine list. 

We went to Fig Tree for my birthday last night and really enjoyed it. The atmosphere is very intimate, but be sure to dress up a bit as you will otherwise feel out of place. Our server, Ty, was very good about making recommendations and was attentive without being annoying throughout the entire meal. On to the food.... 

We started with the appetizer special, which was squash flowers stuffed with ricotta cheese and pesto and then flash fried. Very, very good. We then moved on to the salad course. The house salad is delicious with the added goat cheese and homemade balsamic vinaigrette dressing. I had the halibut special, which was out of this world. So delicious and cooked to perfection. My boyfriend had the filet and said it was very good as well. 

For dessert, you must, and I mean MUST, have the beignets with coffee gelato and cinnamon anglaise. I'm serious - one of the best desserts I've ever had, and that's saying a lot as I'm quite the dessert aficionado. The mixed berry bread pudding was also delicious, but if you're only ordering one dessert, go with the beignets. Or if you're ordering two desserts, get two orders of beignets. You get my point.... 

Parking is no problem as the restaurant has a private lot. One thing I found a bit odd is that the bathrooms are on the second level, so if you have a disability (or plan to partake in a few alcoholic beverages), please keep that little factoid in mind.
