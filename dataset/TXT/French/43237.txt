lQ9VmIWvM6v-rONPkYX8aQ by far the best meal i've ever had in my life!!!!!!!!!!!
Alex is the epitome of fine dining. I sat at the restaurant looking and feeling like a million bucks but once when i put the food in my mouth was when i KNEW i was million plus. 
will update later but the foie gras, the wagu, even the macaroons. PERFECTION!!!!
