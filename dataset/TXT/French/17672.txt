9ot8oInkYZTt6wkkGe__vQ Great ambience.  Went for winterlicious.  Since there was 3 of us, we tried 3 different appetizers: terrine, soup and duck croquette.  Well, the soup portion was tiny.  Croquette was ok but a bit on the dry side.  Terrine was the best of the 3.  We also sampled the 2 types of beef and Cornish hen.  The hen was vey tasty.  The 2 times of beef was a hit and miss.  Steak was nicely cooked to medium rare but the rib was quite overcooked.  Again, plate temperature overall was luke warm.  All happy with our desserts the lemon tart and chocolate.  

Overall, an enjoyable meal and we would go back.
