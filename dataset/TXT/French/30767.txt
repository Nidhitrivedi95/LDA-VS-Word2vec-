fyJAqmweGm8VXnpU4CWGNw I came here solely for the fact that they had macaroons. For the record they were not freshly made. Most places don't bake their macaroons daily anyways so it makes sense. I personally would not buy macaroons here again, they were way too sweet(in a too much sugar way.) The customer service was friendly, and if you want to grab a bite, this place definitely has a restaurant vibe to it
