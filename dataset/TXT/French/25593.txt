Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA This restaurant is amazing!  I went here with a friend to celebrate my 30th birthday last December and I've been thinking about it ever since.  I'm not ashamed to say I got a restaurants.com coupon so I really went all out for the dinner.  I had the Lobster Curry, which was absolutely delicious!  The mushroom medley that my friend had was great with her steak.  The view was beautiful at night and our server was great!  I don't have a single complaint!  We went to have some drinks at the bar after dinner and had a blast.  Check out the bathrooms if you go to the bar, some of them are floor to ceiling glass with a breathtaking view!
