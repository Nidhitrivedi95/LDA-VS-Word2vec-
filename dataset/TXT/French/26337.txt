D7CnTsm8SCmbQghz1ioPdw We have all heard about farm to table restaurants, I had never heard about a game to table restaurant.  Quite possibly this was the best meal of my life.  

It started with the bison tartare, followed by a venison chop which was done exquisitely. 

I skipped the desert and ambled down the street to the snow falling on old Montreal.

In Spanish we say "panza llena, corazón contentó".  Full belly happy heart!
