H3gLUOAYxnYL6Rzgvq28Jg Great place for fresh tasting tartares! It wasn't my first time here and after more than a year i came back and its still just as good. We had the tatare de cardeau ( top left), beef tartare ( top right), vitello tonato ( bottom left) and gravlax de truite. Everything tasted great except the gravlax, ive had it in the past but they completely changed it. The combination just didn't work for me. For the other 3 we tried, seasonings weren't over powering and you could still taste the greatness of the meat. Not a huge fan of beef tartare but this one was really good. Portions look small but i shared with a friend and it was more than enough for 2.
