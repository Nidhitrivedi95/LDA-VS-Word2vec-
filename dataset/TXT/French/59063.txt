rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w A truly memorable dinner experience
Decor/ambience-Our table for two looked out over the lake and fountain show that repeats every 20 minutes; the walls covered by unique  whimsical murals of circus scenes very tastefully done; agree completely with V L

Service-could not have been better; two tuxedo clad "Captains" served us with help from dedicated pleasant bread server; all were knowledgeable of menu and wines

Food-Wow  Lobster salad had large chunks  and sauteed fois gras was tasty but undercooked for my taste, the only hiccup in our meal
Entrees- 
Sea Bass and Beef Tornado(Filet Mignon) with sauteed fois gras this time cooked just right....sauces with both were perfect
Breads were unlike any we've had
Forgot.... meal began with marinated cherries  served in lemon zest rose water...tasty

Dessert-chocolate souffle with vanilla ice cream and creme fresh and creme broulee .... both were spectacular
meal ended with selection of petit fours that  were consistent with fine dining we had come to expect that evening

What can I say a memorable evening in every respect....Le Cirque is Le Best!!!!
