AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw The actual Payard was booked for the whole day so we had to settle on Payard Express instead. We thought we were looking at a over-priced little lifeless sandwich. 

So OK, it was small and overpriced ($10+). But it was also pretty darn good. We were saving our stomachs for buffet so we split a ham and cheese croissant. I know that sounds very simple and easy-to-make at home, but it was amazing here. Perfectly buttered and toasted croissant stuffed with gooey, melted cheese and little bits of ham. Absolute perfection. 

These sandwiches didn't come with the sides that were shown in the sample plates; I should've asked about that. 

My friends ordered the croque crepe with sunny side up egg, which looked bomb and filling. Next time, I'll be ordering that. 

The little truffle machine also didn't seem to be working in the daytime; bummer.
