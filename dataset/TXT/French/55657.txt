rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Exquisite and just a phenomenal place to eat and dine out with that special someone. The experience was fantastic. The food, drinks, appetizers and the presentation were one of the best I have had on a long time. Located in the heart of the Venetian casino, we have a VIP experience all the way. The salad was perfectly dressed and seasoned. The stake and the seafood which were our main course for meal were prepared better than imagined. A little pricy but worth every penny.
