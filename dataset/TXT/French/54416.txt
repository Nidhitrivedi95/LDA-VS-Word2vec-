Went again over Labor Day weekend while staying at Aria. This time around was a disappointment.  We went after being at the pool for a little while and went during brunch.  It was very busy and food was coming out fast. Unfortunately mine was wrong, I specifically asked for lobster Benedict and ended up with smoked salmon. I mentioned it to the bartender and they looked at the computer and said that I did order lobster.  After looking forward to it and not being a real fan of smoked salmon I was not thrilled with the meal. Then there was a problem with charging the bill to the room so this was well below the experience of my last few visits and hopefully not an indicator of what the future holds.
