JezHN-9KKLTMbojq00VP0g A friend of mine suggested this place after a long night out downtown. She was lucky because it couldn't be a more perfect place.  Its exactly what you want to see in this city. Very quaint, friendly, original, cozy and, oh yes, the food was excellent.  The crepes were out of this world. I wanted to try everything on the menu. It was difficult to decide. I have this appreciation for finding places like this and being overjoyed with how different they are without going over-the-top. Needless to say it gives me yet one more reason to venture into the city more often.
