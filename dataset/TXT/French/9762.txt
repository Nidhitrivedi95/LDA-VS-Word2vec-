4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw i was surprised that i actually enjoyed this restaurant. most lv restaurants are overrated and over priced. here's the breakdown of our dinner: 

the soup du jour was super yummy. it was a corn bisque(?) ...chilled...creamy...delicious! 

the french onion soup was also very good....light yet flavorful. 

the tomato salad...very refreshing. good blend of flavors. 

we should have stopped there but had already ordered entrees. skate was not bad but i was already too full to enjoy it. and the steak was steak. didn't really stand out to me.

i would go back but maybe order another appetizer and pass on the entrees.
