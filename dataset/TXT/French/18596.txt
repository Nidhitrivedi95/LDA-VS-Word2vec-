AcWAop2TvCRp-DhWl7qR6w Excellent French food, great service, cozy bistro atmosphere. This was my first French meal in Montreal and I enjoyed it so much.  I had the filet mignon with brie that came with fries and salad, and everything was delicious. I definitely would love to return again if I visit Montreal again. Love their garden with outdoor seating in the Quartier Latin neighborhood as well.
