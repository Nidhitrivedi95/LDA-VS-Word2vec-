_T7f2wUgNlJqxsR-cR89SQ Overall a pretty good experience.
We were running seriously late, but they still held our table, which was amazing.
Our table ordered the filet mignon, which was one of the best anyone had eaten...ever! All of the fish ones were strictly above average ( sea bass, halibut). Service was great! You felt attended to. Biggest complaint- we had told them we had a birthday in our group, but no effort was made to put a candle in that persons dessert or make any other special attempt. Very disappointed in that. Also we requested a view, which we did not get. Understandable, given that we were late. Overall, above average food, good service and an overall fun experience.
