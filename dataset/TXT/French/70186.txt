wwgRu0TAMX8rfRhsiI0ifQ We came here for a Free ice coffee and Caramel Macchiato for $1 on a Friday morning. 

- Avoid the resort fee and get your free Wi-Fi here. 
- Nice seating. Good place to take a break from it all. 
- No real complaints about the coffee since it was free. Staying at the hotel, they give you free vouchers for coffee and $2 off specialty coffee drinks. 
- Starbucks taste better. Needs to be stronger.
