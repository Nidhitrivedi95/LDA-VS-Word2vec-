Look out for Paris Eiffel Tower, follow towards that direction and the restaurant is just next to it. Ask for patio seating where you can see the beautiful water fountain show just across the road. Service and food is good, feels as if I'm having a holiday in Europe.

Seafood platter @$54 (comes with 4 pieces of prawns, 2 pieces of lobsters, 4 pieces of oysters and appetizer of salmon and avocado salad with toasted bread. Seafood is good but it is quite pricey for the at amount of seafood that we are getting. 8/10 

Service is good and I love the ambience of the place. Very cosy and I feel as if I'm having my dinner in Europe.

Tips: 
Ask for patio seating, you can see the water fountain show just across the street.
