teTQU7TIPE0O_B1zN_239w Mimi's Cafe is New Orleans themed restaurant that serves American cuisine. They offer happy hour specials all day - all glasses of wine are $5. For non-alcoholic beverage, I'd recommend the Arnold Palmer.  After placing our order, the server brought us a basket of bread which consisted of two mini baguette and two slices of banana bread. For dinner, we shared a Warm Spinach Artichoke Dip, Grilled Chicken Caesar Salad, and French Pot Roast. The Spinach Artichoke Dip was served hot and runny. It was rich and creamy. It was made with chopped kale and aged parmesan. It was served with warm tortilla chips. The Grilled Chicken Caesar Salad consisted of fresh romaine lettuce, grated Parmesan cheese, and black pepper croutons tossed in a Caesar dressing. All salads come with a baguette or muffin. There were many different types of muffins and I chose a Cranberry Orange Muffin. The French Pot Roast consisted of a buttery scoop of mashed potatoes surrounded by braised beef brisket, carrots, mushrooms, and pearl onions in a red wine shallot sauce.
