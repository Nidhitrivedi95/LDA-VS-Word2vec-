uP3H5bcsiTXM0k0xQhRndg Consider this a 41/2 star review. They only lost half a star due to the limited menu and they ran out of the Redneck Pulled Pork that I had been dreaming about.
Our sever was adorable and really cared about the restaurant and its patrons. Not sure if this was an aspect of her personality or because she was a friend of the family but it really adds to your dining experience when the staff cares.
We missed this place on our initial visit to Old Montreal but fortunately it's a short walk from the Place d'Armes metro stop.
