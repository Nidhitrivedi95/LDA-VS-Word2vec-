xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g Fantastic time. Great service great foot great atmosphere!  It was my wife and I's 10 year anniv and when we made the reservation at the desk, JP was very accommodating. He actually called me on my cell when an earlier time opened up because we were seeing the "O" show that night.  Great guy!!! We overlooked the Bellagio dancing fountains, such a great sight!
