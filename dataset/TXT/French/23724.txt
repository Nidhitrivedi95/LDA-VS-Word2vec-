cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg OH HOLY HELL!  This was our best dining experience in Montreal, and probably top 5 in my lifetime.  I don't know what else I can add other than giving a breakdown of our perfectly planned dinner that did not leave us overly stuffed.  Table for 2: Foie Gras Cromesquis (I could pop like 20 of these in my mouth), Blue Cheese, Apple & Endive Salad (i know.. a salad.. but i think the acidity helped prepare for the glutony ahead), and the Stuffed Pied de Cochon with Foie Gras.  Now the star is the actual stuffed leg, but I swear I developed an addiction to the mashed potatoes underneath, which tasted like the best boxed potatoes blended with the powder on sour cream and chive potato chips.  I mean this as a compliment.  They were delicious. We ordered 4 glasses of wine.. the $10 was not worth it, but I do recommend the $11 glass underneath it on the menu. Our waiter also kicked some serious ass. Hope to see you again!
