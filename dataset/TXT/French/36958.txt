in3zjiaLpNzr9G3K35gAJQ Very nice quaint restaurant.  The food was delicious from the complimentary croissants with blueberry sauce to the entrées.  My boyfriend had a panini and I had the crab cakes very well executed meals.  The service is great and we even got complimentary desserts.  I would come back, I highly recommend it.
