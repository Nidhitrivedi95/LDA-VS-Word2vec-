w2tr0PA0b3tg8pId0kjM-A I've had many macarons, including ones from famous bakeries in San Francisco and New York. I can honestly say that Gaby Et Jules makes wonderful macarons and pastries, and I am so excited they are in my neighborhood! I love supporting local businesses that put their heart and soul into their products, and this place does just that. Every pastry is meticulously crafted, and beautiful to look at. There were many samples when I stopped in, and everything was delicious. I got 6 macarons, and loved each one. Will definitely return, and bring my French friends when they are in town.
