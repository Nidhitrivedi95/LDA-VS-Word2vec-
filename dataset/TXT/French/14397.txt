5BAdubSKMARs3qYRHGaClA Duplicated business entries in Yelp make me notify continuously the moderators that they need to fix them. Verses Sky also exists as Terrasse Nelligan, but the real name is the the second one as per my recent research and I hope those two will merge into one entry soon. 

Four stars for the awesome view of this roof top bar located in Nelligan hotel and its clear sangria with litches. All the drinks were good, only the Old Fashioned was surprising with its muddled chunks of orange instead of finely peeled orange strip, but the drink was not on the menu and they fixed it for our table. As the terrace is certainly associated with the hotel bar Verses I'm sure they can get some bar tender advices on this fine drink (they know how to make strong and well balanced cocktails in Verses bar).

We had cheerful and happy service during our last visit, and overall great time. Wonderful spot to stop for a drink and snack in the Old Port of Montreal!
