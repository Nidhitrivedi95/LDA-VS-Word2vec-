0d6kx6Jlocw77y1J9nbqMA I'm not much of a pastry eater during the week, that's usually when Im dinning out. So I can't really comment on their baked  goods. I will say I find the salads and soup  be very good! The bread served with the lunches is amazing. For the most part Arizona makes horrible bread and this tastes like it was made with water from somewhere on the east coast. So good!
