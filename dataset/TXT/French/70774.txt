XbG4OgFoaSIxQxVRhTxU2w My wife and I came here based on a recommendation from a friend and we were not disappointed. We both had the 9 dish tasting menu and we loved everything that was brought to us. The highlights were definitely the Foie Gras, one of the best I have ever had, and the duck ravioli was exquisite.  The food here transports you to France which is exactly what I hope for when coming to Montreal.  I definitely recommend anyone visiting Montreal to make a point of stopping by Kitchenette.
