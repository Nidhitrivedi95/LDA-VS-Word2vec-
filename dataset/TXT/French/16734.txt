8nWjW3T35-Mw0tcffe1KIg We visited Cafe du Lac while in town, and were pleasantly surprised by both the food and service.  The seafood was clearly extremely fresh and the sides tasty and well-prepared.  Service was attentive and helpful - he was able to guide us in wine selection and went the extra mile to make sure we enjoyed our visit.
