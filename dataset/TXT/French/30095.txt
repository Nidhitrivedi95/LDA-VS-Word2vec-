fRu_POqPowUo6nHSRMjOPw Really enjoyed the food here and the staff was great. I thought the focus on local neighborhood cuisine was a very cool touch particularly if you're from out of town. 

The only complaint was the plate/cutlery combination.  Sounds stupid but if you set the fork on the edge of the plate it slides off then flips up tossing food or sauce all over you! I'm all for pretty tableware but not at the expense of practicality.  The waitress said it happens all the time! Hello!!!

So other than my ruined brand new shirt the place is great.  :-)
