intKyiipUlHDWi_chv0f3A I'm glad to see that there is something in this space. Right off of Lincoln Park, it's a nice place to do lunch. While we were there, the menu was fairly small, but there was a promise of additional menu items coming soon. 

I had the turkey press sandwich, and my friend had the Cuban. We gave each other half so we could try both, and they were both very good. I would recommend this as a place to come for a quick bite.  It's very casual, and is also a good option for carry out. Additionally, it appeared that they had a wide variety of wines to purchase by the bottle. I did not sample any of those or pay a lot of attention to the selection. 

I did, however, have a "adult cola" which is a cola with less sugar. They have other unique soda options. Next time, I may try a ginger beer.
