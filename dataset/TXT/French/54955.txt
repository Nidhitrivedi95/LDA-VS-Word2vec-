rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A After hearing so much about this place, I was pretty stoked about finally checking it off my list. 

Conveniently we stayed at Venetian on the 10th floor during our trip, so we literally walked across the hall to the restaurant. This saves SO much time when you're in Vegas!! 

Came in on Sat at 8:30am for brunch. To my surprise, there was hardly anyone there. I was expecting a wait (even that early) since it is one of the most "sought after restaurants in Las Vegas." This is per the concierge, but I totally believe it.  

Sat outside on the patio overlooking one of the Venetian pools. (I believe it was the canyon creek pools). 

Service was Great and pretty attentive. 

Croissant- good. But unfortunately I just came back from Paris so it's hard to be woo'ed when you've had a croissant at the best place in the world to eat one. Anyways... 

Fruit salad- wanted some fruit to cleanse my palate but this was mistake. Just got a few pieces of blueberries, cantaloupe, and melon. I mean, where are the strawberries and kiwi or something else cool and tropical? Totally underwhelmed. 

Chicken and waffles- didn't eat this but cousins ordered it and said it was quite the dish! 

Madam croque- a bit underwhelmed considering this is a classic French dish. I honestly could've made this at home, but I was curious to try it at bouchon and it was ok. 

Salmon with capers and bread. Bf had this and it was solid. 

So I wasn't blown away by the food but it was still a nice experience and I give it 3 stars bc it was pleasant and reasonably priced IMO. Good but not great.
