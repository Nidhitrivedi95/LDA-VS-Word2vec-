m4PW-GMc8JOU5nmMYncu-Q Visiting this place is an experience in itself. If you are a tourist looking to visit something unique, a connoisseur, or someone looking for something different than crawling into your favourite watering hole and get hammered..this place is for everyone.
The drinks are a little expensive..I agree but you're paying for the craftiness and the show. This is not the kind of bar you go to every week but a kind of place where you take your date or outstation friends visiting you to show them something different. 
The bartenders showcasing their impressive mixology, juggling and pyrotechnic skills..all for you chief. 
Sit back, sip your cocktails slow and take in the experience. You know you're in for a great experience.
