hzyvL2v97xLzLbLXcdi1uw I came to Cafe Moulin on a couple of different occasions but mostly for brunch. While there is usually a wait, I have never experienced a wait longer than 15-20 min. Now most of the brunch places do not take reservations and Cafe Moulin is no different. I have had a couple of their savory and sweet crepes, coffee and also their french toast. All that I have had so far was fresh, light and very delicious, but specifically the French Toast was definitely my favorite. I also much prefer Cafe Moulin's crepes over Crepe Parisienne in Oakland. Much better quality, fresher ingredients and nicer atmosphere. I find the staff very friendly and approachable. Last time we were 3 people and in order to get in quicker we were sitting at the "bar" right next to the kitchen. It was a bit uncomfortable for 3 people (but that was our fault as we asked to sit there) so as soon as we spotted a table becoming available we asked the owner if it would be possible to switch and it was absolutely no problem at all. Every time I am here I feel welcomed and the food is amazing. What more can you ask for?
