YUFxSG6idHePsxOmnSHtpQ Service was a bit slow, although I was seated quickly. Corn chowder was tasty but not very hot. Had the Cheddar  Broccoli Quiche. Filling was good, but the crust was really soggy, even the edges. Seemed like it could have been microwaved. Probably won't go back unless that is where others want to go.
