jLxeBgWhLRbII2ACkgH1Sg Here's another rare neighborhood gem. We tried their quiche lorraine, blueberry twist, chocolate croissant, and almond galette. While the pastry items were warm, fresh, and delicious, the quiche was only so-so for us. They seemed a bit slow and disorganized at opening time. None of the items were labeled, nor had prices. Nevertheless, we will definitely return to try their other pastries, but will pass on their quiche.
