I checked out Le Neuf cafe with fellow yelper Denise. Its along a row of houses just north of Clarence Park, on the NE corner of Spadina and Wellington. There is a small outdoor patio with bistro chairs. Because of the cool weather we decided to sit inside, which was cozy and not too loud. I love the decor-French eclectic and elegant.

I went with the omelette of day, served with home potatoes and salad. It was great, well cooked, soft cheese and peppers filled. Denise had their smoked salmon sandwich-huge serving size! They use the whole baguette!

Overall a pleasant dining experience. It felt intimate and for a moment you could imagine yourself in France in a small cafe :). This place is new and I got the sense they are still finding their rhythm, but service was friendly and relatively on time.

Good place for breakfast, brunch or lunch.
