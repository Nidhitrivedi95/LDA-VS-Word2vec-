9ot8oInkYZTt6wkkGe__vQ My sister and I went to Auberge du Pommier for a Winterlicious meal and were more than impressed by everything about this restaurant! I'll definitely consider going again when my pocketbook can handle it, for very special occasions.

The restaurant decor was beautiful: intimate but not stuffy. The chairs were super comfy and they had a real fireplace burning. Fantastic for the cold, winter day on which we visited. It felt very relaxing to be dining there and we were able to sit back with some great food and have a conversation. 

My sister and I both had the leek and cabbage soup. I found it a bit too salty but I loved the croutons on top and how they served it with a poached egg. For the main course I had the pot au feu which was really tender. My sister had the pork chop: it was the thickest one I've ever seen! She let me sneak a few bites and it was juicy and incredibly flavourful. If I had the meal over again, I might have switched my entree to the pork chop. For dessert I had the sticky date pudding and loved it! It was pleasantly lighter than I expected it to be. My sister was in heaven with the chocolate mousse cake. 

More than anything, I was really pleased with the fantastic service we received. I've heard that Winterlicious customers don't always get treated very well at these upscale restaurants but that was not at all the case at Auberge! The staff were obviously immaculately trained and were more than polite, they were really friendly and helpful. Like with the decor, I was again pleasantly surprised the service was classy but not stuffy. They took our coats, tucked in our chairs as we sat and ensured that I got a delicious, dairy free meal (allergy). 

Go to Auberge du Pommier, especially for a lovely Winterlicious experience!
