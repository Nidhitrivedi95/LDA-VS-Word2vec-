YBWG4INShu3tvinpD2fPOQ What a unique and amazing restaurant - half French and half sushi!! The presentation of the food is absolutely beautiful, and the taste is even better. The prices are tremendously affordable as well, especially when compared to other sushi restaurants in town like Kyo. Highly, highly recommend!
