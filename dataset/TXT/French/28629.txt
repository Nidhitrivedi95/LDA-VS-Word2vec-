eJ9L40jm5VOXCIq7xs9kQw On the day of our 20th anniversary, we headed to a traditional quiet French restaurant which did not disappoint.  We lucked out with a quiet table by the window.  Katrine took good care of us throughout the night.

The bread was good to start and butter nice and soft.  We toasted with some Ayala rose champagne before digging into our starters of lobster salad and mixed greens.  Vicki liked the lobster salad and said the maple did a nice job of counteracting the bitterness of hazelnut.  My mixed greens were nicely dressed and fresh.

We both had meat for our mains--venison medallions for me and veal cutlet for her.  Both were good.  Will say that the cutlet was really a chop but that didnt cause a problem.  

To drink we had a 2000 Leoville Poyferre that was terrific.  Just a touch of tannin

For dessert we went souffle and were not disappointed.  These were amazing.  The chocolate souffle was more of a chocolate chip one and while not what I was expecting, the chips were evenly dispersed and created a tremendous flavor burst.  Vicki loved her grand marnier version of the same.  We washed them down with Graham's 20 year old port which seemed appropriate.
