pmoIMK8zGWvKsVOPDBYfzg I was in Vegas this week and purchased a travelzoo deal for Andre's. It was a three course prefix meal for two. My expectations were definitely surpassed. Everything tasted so good that I didn't want to stop eating even though I was stuffed. I will definitely return to Andres next time I am in Vegas. The creme brulé was amazing. The steak was flavorful. And the lobster bisque was to die for.
