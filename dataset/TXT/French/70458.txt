xaqW4NkmUCGRRjmLxiFJ6Q The service here is great and staff are always friendly. It's a small place but I've only been first thing when they open so seating usually isn't an issue. I can see them being packed during busy hours. Try their coffee (black). You won't regret it! The good morning T. O. is absolutely perfect if you haven't had breakfast yet. They let you swap items in the crepes if you're not feeling a particular topping. I just wish they opened earlier! Tons of parking free underground. The surface parking is closer but you are very lucky if you find a spot.
