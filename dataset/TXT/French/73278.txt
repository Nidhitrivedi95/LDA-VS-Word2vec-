Xu6mEU7IbKlWic1ETgUOeA Another of my top five favorite Madison restaurants.  A great mix of French and Mediterranean cuisine.  You never know who you are going to run into here....last time I sat next to Lieutenant Governor Barbara Lawton and the controversial Nino Amato also frequents the place.  The owner, Abdul, is Moroccan and quite the character!  Fantastic wine list and you can't beat the atmosphere.  Second floor, right on State street, this place is a favorite for the classy in Madison to take in the Halloween party without actually partaking.  The calamari is fantastic, as well as the duck in a plum sauce.  I've never heard of something that wasn't superb.  Just be prepared to pay.....entrees are $36-40 and I've never seen a couple eat here for less than $100 (with wine).  Don't miss the cookie cup dessert...it's a masterpiece!!!  5 stars!!
