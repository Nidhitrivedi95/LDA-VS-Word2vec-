4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I'm partial to French cooking so I always try to eat at Mon Ami Gabi when I'm in Vegas.   It's located in the Paris casino overlooking the Las Vegas strip.  If you manage to score a seat outside you'll get a great view of not only the human traffic on the strip but of the fountain show across the street at the Bellagio.  

I always have the same meal only varying on which type of Steak Frites: French Onion Soup, Steak Frites and Crème Brûlée.   The Steak Frites is a treat for me because it gives me a break from the usual steakhouse fare of filets, ribeyes and strips (although they serve those as well).   It's simple to make and there's nothing better to eat.  It's a thin, lean cut with less marbling and best cooked rare to medium rare.   My favorites are the Steak Clasique, Steak Roquefort or Steak Bearnaise.  You'll also find many other French staples such as baguettes and escargot.
