4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw This place is excellent! The past few times I've been to Vegas I noticed that this place was always packed, so on our trip over this past weekend, I made it a point to schedule a visit. We made reservations for breakfast- when we arrived we were seated without a wait. The wife ordered the Skinny Apple Pancakes and I ordered the Blueberry French Toast. The pancakes are made the same thickness of crape and the French Toast is two - three think slices of super moist bread. Both dishes were amazing and I highly recommend that you try both the if possible.
