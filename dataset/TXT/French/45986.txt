mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q Simply the best food in town. If you have not been there yet, and if you are ready to splurge for a special occasion or just because you can, this is THE place to go. 

Totally informal (no need to wear a bow and a suite, yet do not go in shorts and flip flops!), relaxed atmosphere, this place is not about being seen, it is about the food. 

I feel that no words would be good enough to describe the quality, freshness, taste, texture you would get, so better if you just try it for yourself. You will NOT be disappointed.
