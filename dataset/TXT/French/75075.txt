XZ7eQLjyGXf6y69UT4SGhg Best pastries in our area of the city.  Quality ingredients and great execution.  They even know to tell you detailed reheating instructions if you're getting pastries to go.  Can't go wrong with this place.  Had a great savory crepe and apple turnover.  The turnover's pastry was super flaky and tender with just the right amount of crispness on the outside.  Tasty filling.  Crepe had mushrooms, goat cheese, and bacon.  Delicious.
