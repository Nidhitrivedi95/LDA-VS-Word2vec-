kIW8IeTV3W1tS_q_WAU4wQ Pretty classy joint conveniently located near the center of Montreal.  The service here is akin to the fancy smancy restaurants in the states and dare I say that the food is pretty darn good too.  

The wait staff was very helpful, the sommelier was attentive and even the woman serving the bread was on top of her game.  From a pure service standpoint this place is an easy 5 stars of gloriousness.  

I got the poutine, mac & cheese as well as the steak.

- The poutine was good, but the cheese curds could have been smaller so as to not be devoured in a single bite and virtually gone after the top layer of french fries were eaten.

- The mac and cheese was pretty solid, and portions were reasonable.

- Finally the steak was overcooked, yet still maintained a reasonable consistency and flavor.  

All in all a solid experience!
