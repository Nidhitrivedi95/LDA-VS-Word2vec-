mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q So we used to come at least every other month and this is truly one of my top 5 in the world..... Specifically THIS location.  The quail, the mashed potatoes, the foie sliders, the gravlax.... Everything to die for.  And one of my favorites was the free little slice of cinnamon tart at the end.  It's like the best condensed milk tart dusted with cinnamon.  They even sent me home with a whole tart for my birthday once!  We used to go all the time but once Emmanuelle left, we just didn't feel like the experience was as personal.  AND we had kids so there's that!  LOL.  But I think we will have to revisit this old favorite soon as we have had many special meals here.
