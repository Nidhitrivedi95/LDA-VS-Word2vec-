H464UiJ5c7q5dAJ14h731A We tried for 3 days to come and eat at Le Gus, but It was always fully booked. Finally, we had the chance to have dinner here with my parents, and It was excellent.

The place is cosy, very little but not too crowded. The staff was really nice, I loved the fact that our waitress explained to us with so much details and clarity what was on the menu that night (as my mother is very complicated with new flavours).

We took an entree - tartare de salmon gravlax, huitres, Caesar salad. Mine was delicious, very spicy with the touch of wasabi. Then I ordered the bavette with a chipotle marinade, and what can I say : it was one of the best thing I ever ate. The dessert was very original and surprisingly good (dark chocolate cake with Bailey's cream).

All in all, it is quite expensive, but when you taste the quality....totally worth it !!!!
