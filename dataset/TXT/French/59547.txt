s-zwyD8YOm-y3AbRrsRx7w Eating German (or Germany-related food) is surprisingly difficult in Montreal, but Alpenhaus solves all this by promising your favourite artery-clogging delicacies. Well, it is a Swiss restaurant, but it'll do. The place is an institution, and has been around since the late 60's, when apparently, it was THE place to be for the up-and-coming young guns in the advertisement business. The place has no windows and back in the day, you could smoke all you wanted. I'm simply amazed to think the place has survived the combination of cigarettes and over-sprayed beehives! 
The interior is very kitschy-60's chalet and intimate, which I adore, and so did my parents. The ambiance alternates, from time to time a pianist will serenade the room, to be replaced by 70's hits. As mentioned previously, everything is pretty steep. My mom chose to try the swiss fondue and both my father and I couldn't resist Schnitzel. The fondue was delicious but my mom was quickly disappointed when she realized the portion size wasn't what she had anticipated. I have nothing bad to say about my Schnitzel and Spätzli, except that they were a bit cold. 
The Black Forest cake is on the other hand totally disappointing, and was probably bought at a local supermarket. Maybe you'll have better luck with the Kirsch cake? 
The chocolate fondue (for two) really is good enough for one. Or maybe it's just time I take a hint and quit eating already. It was very sweet and didn't strike me as particularly rich or unique. Meh. The service leaves a lot to be desired. The waiters weren't rude, but forgetful, and I can't survive on one glass of water a meal.

So for me Alpenhaus is all about the experience and a big hearty meal, I wouldn't come here expecting fine-dining.
Oh, and they don't speak german. My father tried that; total embarrassment. The maitre d'h does speak Swedish tough, go figure.
