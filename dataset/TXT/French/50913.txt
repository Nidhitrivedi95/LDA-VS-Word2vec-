oZHbPhIj01_31jqD053a_Q This restaurant has the best wait staff ever! I was dining alone and they were all incredibly attentive and funny. I hadn't read too much about this restaurant prior to arriving so I had no idea what to expect but it was literally one surprise after another. There is a lot of effort and detail that goes into each dish. The presentation was fantastic. From the little book filled with a poof of smoke to the cotton candy tree. :) I also had the calamari tagliatelle which was absolutely delicious. I liked that the portions weren't too big because with all the other small snacks and treats they brought out throughout the meal, it was already incredibly filling. I would definitely dine here again but with my friends or on a date so I can share this amazing experience with them :)
