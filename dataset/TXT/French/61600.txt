SJo_IjvzdRtCvZVN0cbrRQ I was pleasantly surprised by The Golden Goose/The Blue Door.
I'm not clear on why the name change occurred, but the sign outside today prominently says "The Golden Goose."  The menus say "The Blue Door."  We drove up on a rainy day; it may have been the weather, but the exterior did not look promising.  The menu was interesting, though, with a broad range of sweet and savory breakfasts.  I ordered shrimp and grits, the person I was with ordered an omelet.  When our food arrived, we discovered a fried potato thing (kind of like a hash brown, but rather thick,) which I immediately ordered.  Shrimp and grits were great, potato thing was wonderful.  Service was fine without hovering.  Pastries look fantastic, I'll head back for some tomorrow.  I wish I was here longer so I could try more of their menu!
