VwZhwflLnTq19aAeFLJHCQ My first visit. Let me say that I am a food snob. Being in restaurants/hospitality for roughly 30 years...I can be a tough critic. 
I have been looking for a nice salmon dish since leaving Seattle 4 years ago, and I have tried many places. While the salmon was farmed, I decided to try it anyways and I was thrilled to have done so! It was amazingly prepared and delicious.
I started with the beet and goat cheese plate with mixed greens and that was very good. Not my favorite but above average. Remember I am a snob and have eaten at some very spectacular restaurants in my day. I chose to rate the dish on it's own, four stars. The salmon won the prize with a solid five stars! The creme brulee for dessert sadly was a one star for me. The custard was overcooked and not sweet for my preference and the sugar on top was burnt. 
The ambiance was very enjoyable. And while there was a musical duo performing live, the volume was appropriate and the song choices were as well. Live music can easily overpower, but my guests and I found them to add to the atmosphere delightfully.
Our server was charming and very attentive. I give him five stars.
Food was delivered in good time. Timing I give 5 stars.
We were never rushed or left waiting too long.
I highly recommend that you give Bernard's Bistro a try.

My friends had the braised chicken...she rated it five stars.
Other friend had the fillet mignon 3 ways (sauces)....he rated it five stars.

Oh, while the place is upscale, my friends and I were casually dressed. We felt very comfortable there even though there were many folks that were dressed much nicer then we were. I would say that you could tell we were there for the food and not a date! Speaking of date, I would highly recommend for a date. Just down the street from the Galaxy movie theater.
