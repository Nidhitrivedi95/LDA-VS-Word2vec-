oTfBJGJORIfYJ_VxUMWW1Q Get the cherry coffee iced tea. My review could honestly end there because that's all I need to say, but I will continue. 

RI are some of the best roasters in this city. They really care about the product and it shows. I'm so confused on how this coffee shop has anything lower than a 4 star rating because it is clearly a 5 star operation. 

Even when I move out of this area . I know I'm coming back just for this place. 

Okay gtg- literally going there right now!
