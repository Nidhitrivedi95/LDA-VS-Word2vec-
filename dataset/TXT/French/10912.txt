4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Qui présenter des contradictions!?  Two years ago we had a wonderful breakfast, and today we had a completely different experience.  

Pros:
Most of the food was tasty ... really, truly delish
Waiter was friendly, even though he clearly had too many tables
Setting (glassed in patio) was lovely
Will do half orders for kids

Cons:
Slow service ... I mean really slow 
Over cooked food (waffles disintegrated into crumbs when cut, English muffin required a serrated knife)
Manager was walking the floor but completely missed our pleas for help

The smoked salmon plate and crepes are winners!  Waffles and benedicts, not so much.
