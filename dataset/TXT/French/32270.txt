gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA We reserved a table during Reataurant Week and were told by our concierge that Alize was a participant in the Restaurant Week program of which a three course meal could be purchased from a special select menu for $50 per person. When we were seated we told our waiter why we were there and he acted like he understood. When we were done our bill was $360 for my husband and I. When we questioned the waiter he responded that we only ask about the program and didn't specify that was what we wanted....we feel that he knew what we wanted he just saw an opportunity and took advantage of it. If you choose to eat there beware of unexpected charges from waiters without integrity. The quality of food was good but not as good as Mesa Grill where we enjoyed dinner the next night where they were a proud participant of the Restaurant Week.
