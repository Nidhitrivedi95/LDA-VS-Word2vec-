ysJo5Jdo29XOBCnKrbUKWg My wife and I used to frequent Paris 66 when we first moved to PGH, and loved our first 2 or 3 visits. Unfortunately, about a year ago, we noticed that the quality of the experience slipped significantly, and we stopped making this our go-to place when out and about on Saturday afternoons for lunch. We have voted for it in the local votes for "Best French Restaurant" before, because of our positive initial experiences there.

When we first tried the place, we really enjoyed their chicken (a simple, yet truly delicious dish...), mussels, and nicoise salad. All of these dishes were at least as good, if not better than some of the great food we enjoyed when we visited Paris.

Our last visit there was several months ago for "Brunch" - definitely a disappointment. None of the dishes that came as part of our $18 "Brunch" were good - the eggs were runny, the pain au chocolat was cold, and side salad was uninspired. We were so disappointed, we have taken a "break" from the place for the last several months. Recently, we have noticed that their website and menu have been revamped and are considering a return there to try things out again.

We have never had the problems with the wait staff that other reviewers have had, and frequently have enjoyed short, friendly conversations with them during our visits - for us, they have been an enjoyable part of the experience, as they always treated our family and children well.

Pricing is a little high for the dishes served, and the lunch menu could use a "tweak" perhaps to make the portions smaller and less expensive to encourage throughput. Perhaps trimming down the number of dishes on the regular menu would allow the team to focus even more on execution, consistency, and value for their patrons. We would love to see Paris 66 return to the high level we first enjoyed, and know they definitely have what it takes to make this happen.
