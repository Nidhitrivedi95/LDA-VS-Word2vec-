8nWjW3T35-Mw0tcffe1KIg I visited Café du Lac during Summerlicious and had an amazing dining experience. The service was wonderful and the food was fantastic. For starters, I had the foie gras poutine topped with pulled beef short ribs. They've received a lot of attention for their poutine, and deservedly so. For the main course, I had the duck magret. Both dishes were absolutely wonderful. The only downside is that they're all the way out in Etobicoke. But it's closer than Quebec, eh?
