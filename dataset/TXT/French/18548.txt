The menu is very complex and there are many changes to the menu at least weekly if not daily. The crab cakes were good but not great. I would say they were a little dry and maybe overcooked.

The entrees we had were amazing though. We had the lobster ravioli and the Bistro 185 Steak Oscar. The steak oscar was definately the best. Two beef medallions, a huge shrimp, a crab cake, tempura green beans and mashed potatoes. Good luck finishing that, especially if you get an appetizer. The lobster ravioli was a little rich and maybe a touch too much sauce but as a whole, it was amazing. It might have had the best scallops I have ever had. The shrimp were very good, but I would have thought they would have been de-tailed in a ravioli?

The decor and ambiance in the restaurant are nice, but there was no background music and the tables are so close together that it is noisy with conversation in there. And the parking is limited. The service was good though, very friendly people that work there.
