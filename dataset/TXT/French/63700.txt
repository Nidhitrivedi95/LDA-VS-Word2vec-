t1mR_Zff6Dqv1TueE2JLEA It's a funky place that seems to promise so much (when you walk in) but falls somewhat short of delivering on that promise.

If you have a friend visiting you in TO and you want to take them to an interesting place (besides the usual touristy stuff), this should fit the bill. Belly dancers, Moroccan dishes and decor, this is something you don't typically expect to find in Toronto's downtown core.

There is a decent variety of main courses, from $17 to around $30. Some almost beg you to get a side, which would set you back by another $5. 

I felt that my dish was way over-seasoned. I can't remember the name of it but it was lamb cooked in a special Moroccan ceramic dish with a tall ceramic cover. It would be great if it wasn't for all the extra salt they put into it.

So, overall, I don't think I would come here again on my own but I may bring an out-of-towner to show off an unusual spot.
