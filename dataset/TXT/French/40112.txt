KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA I LOVE Marche Bacchus, so it kills me to give them anything but a 5-star review, but today was disappointing and I know my friends are going to yelp this badly, so I'm hoping to mitigate it somewhat.. 

The food is unique and always good.. BUT the wait (1) to give our order, (2) to get our food (over an hour after we were seated) (3) to get our bills and (4) to have our bills taken and processed was inexcusable. Our reservation was for noon -- we left, finally, close to 2:30.

Now the setting is beautiful and what's not to like about sitting on a patio on a lake on a gorgeous day? And if we'd had all the time in the world, I'd say, "okay." But not everyone had 2-1/2  hours for lunch.

The problem seemed to be that the restaurant went from a few people to capacity in about 20 minutes. There were two large groups (ours and one other) seated at our end of the patio, which was 16 people at once. Plus the other regular tables with two and four people. Our waiter was overwhelmed.

I won't go into painful detail, but the service was terrible. Not the waiter's fault -- he was doing his best. Other friends told me, "the kitchen is very small. You have to be patient." (REMEMBER THIS if you go.) After about 30 minutes we finally asked for and got bread. 

Once we had finished eating and asked for the checks it was another 10-12 minutes until someone (actually two different men in succession) came and explained that since we had asked for separate checks, we would have to be patient while they sorted them out. The lady who made the reservation had said we would need separate checks. We told the waiter at the beginning we would want separate checks and asked if it was a problem. He assured us it was not. Well, apparently it was.

I certainly recommend Marche Bacchus for a lovely, laid-back lunch or dinner. Just be sure that you have the time for a leisurely meal.
