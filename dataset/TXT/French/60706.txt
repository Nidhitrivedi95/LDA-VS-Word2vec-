SCklYa_jhihWAcfIn-_chg Honestly, the best "home cooked" food ever. I especially love the soups. The weekend wait can be long, it usually takes forever to get a table for 2. Good luck with a big group --you could be waiting forever unless you get there before 8:00 am. Don't shower before you go. You will stink like breakfast, bacon and eggs all day. However, it would be worth it if you don't care.
