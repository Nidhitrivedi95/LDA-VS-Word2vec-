0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g compared to the prices, food and service at a few other top restaurants in Vegas, this is a far better experience.

service is impeccable, from the moment you walk in to your exit where you'll get a nice gift box of cookies. 

the wine list is impressive, and there are more than a few interesting specialty cocktails. corkage is $50 which is actually reasonable for a place this expensive

there are two prix fixe menus available. we opted for the five course. the menu changes often so not sure how relevant this food review is, but I'll try. bottom line: everything was perfect. Lamb and diver scallops were our favorites. 

don't skip the dessert, although why would you since it's included :)

it's Vegas-casual, e.g. no shorts or flip flops, but you may feel better a little more dressed up than usual

I would love to come back here every time I visit Vegas. it's my new favorite restaurant here
