dgiJTIKS1QYTW2gFyK2X7A I came here with my boyfriend on Friday night. We ordered the charcuterie plate which consisted of four different meat. This place is not known for its charcuterie but my boyfriend wanted to try it. The charcuterie doesn't even come from the resto so it wasn't the best choice of entree. I only liked two things on the plate: the lamb sausage and the nduya sausage pate made with pork. We got bread from the bete a pain bakery. It was thick and soft. It was almost cake-like. We shared two mains. They were the only two meats on the menu. We had the confit de canard with duck heart, sweet potato, rapini, porto sauce; and the hanger steak with celery root, carrots, aïoli and veal juice. I was a bit worried to eat duck heart but it didn't taste like what I expected. My boyfriend found it bland but I liked it because similar to tofu it doesn't taste like much and basically just tastes like whatever the sauce is. The crispy skin of the duck was fabulous. It was salty and fatty and juicy. MMmm so good! My boyfriend found the steak to be chewy but i thought it wasn't chewy at all and I liked the way it was cooked. The taste of the steak alone I didn't particularly like but with the sauce it was very good. Event the veggies with the sauce was amazing. My boyfriend didn't like the food but I think its because he is sick. I thoroughly enjoyed the food.
