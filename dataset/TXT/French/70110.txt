wwgRu0TAMX8rfRhsiI0ifQ Worst service ever!!!!  We had 6pm reservations. After being seated around 6:15, we had to flag our waiter down to put in an order for an appetizer because we were being ignored. 6:45...we grab the manager because or dinner order had never been taken. 7:30-we still did not have food and left because when the manager checked on our order, the kitchen had not even started it and we had tickets to a show.  We will NEVER go back to this restaurant again. Wish I could give it ZERO stars!
