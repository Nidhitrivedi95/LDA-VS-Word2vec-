0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g We stayed at the Bellagio and Picasso was recommended to us by a staff member at the hotel.  WOW!  What a wonderful meal and evening.  We decided to do the tasting menu and were very pleased.  Each dish was better than the last...and each was presented in a beautiful way that you almost didn't want to take a bite! My husband selected the meat dish for his entrée and I selected the Halibut on top of asparagus. I've never tasted Halibut flashed fried like the one I had at Picassos.  The White and Dark Chocolate dessert was so good I used my finger to lick up the last melted piece.  We are looking forward to our next visit to Vegas just for another meal at Picasso!
