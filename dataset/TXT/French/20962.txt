AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw Ambiance was a bit stuffy for me. Maybe it was because I was wearing my Saved by the Bell t-shirt, but I felt out of place. The pre fixe is a great deal - $19 for an appetizer (lobster salad), entree (couscous with lamb and chicken), and dessert (tiramisu). I loved when the waiter brought me the dessert menu and told me I could choose from any of them. I half expected a cup of sorbet to come out, since the desserts are $7 alone.

My friends' entrees looked good. The presentation was great, but if it was anything like my food, it looked better than it tasted. I'd come back for the pre fixe and definitely for their desserts. The bakery had delicious truffles - esp. the earl grey one.
