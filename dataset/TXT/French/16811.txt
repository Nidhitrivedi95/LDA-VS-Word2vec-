8xCiibfgqy-8xpCWEaguqg Our experience at The Keg was a wonderful way to end a long weekend in Montreal on a Sunday night. In addition to the great food, we really enjoyed the atmosphere, the music and the friendly staff. Our waiter, Nicholas, explained the menu beautifully allowing us to make the best choices. I had the escargot stuffed mushrooms, the 20 oz. bone-in rib steak (medium rare) and twice baked potato. Carol had the French onion soup, 14 oz. prime rib with baked potatoes. For dessert we shared a refreshing and delicious Billy Miner pie!
