yIBeZebnXb-hvexqknnDCg I took my wife to the McNinch House for a birthday dinner.  We chose based on the numerous online reviews stating that the McNinch restaurant is perfect for a romantic and quiet evening and we were very much looking forward to our visit. 

Upon arrival, we were very impressed with the ambiance, level of service and of course, the food.  Unfortunately, about 45 minutes into our experience, a large party of 10 was seated in the same room.  The volume and overall boisterous demeanor of the large party killed the mood we were had been enjoying previous to their arrival and therefor dampened the evening.  At times we could barely hear ourselves think, let alone hear each other.  While the staff did acknowledge the disturbance, nothing was done to either remedy the situation by moving and/or quieting the large party.  Our coffees were taken off of our bill but that is very insignificant thanks for the $4 dollar coffees off of a very expensive bill.  

 Going forward, perhaps it would be better for the comfort of all involved to have a separate room designated for large parties only.  It seems like your restaurant makes every effort with the level of service and food so it is a shame to have that effort go to waste due to unfortunate seating placement.  

Also i noticed when i parked in my garage that the hood of my car was open, which means the valet much have hit the wrong button when pulling my car up and thankfully it didnt come open during the trip home.
