5EIuCcoHY2evAhFMBV6G6g very dissapointed :( came here for lunch on a sunday and the service was slow, even though there were only 4 tables seated with customers and two waiters between them. the vegetables in my vegetarian foccacia sandwich had so much seasoning on them, i couldn't tell the difference between the zucchini and bell peppers. also, my portobello mushroom was way too thick and undercooked, so i couldn't bite into it. i had to disassemble the sandwich and eat the vegetables with a fork and knife. the sweet potato fries on the side were the best part of the meal. as i told my friend who was dining with me, "this was the best meal i never had." would not repeat a visit here. the fact that the palazzo website lists this place under "fine dining" and not "casual dining" is amazing to me.
