HojKatUfX4UHWaPqtl63NQ Just finished the food coma from Rivea. A solid 4 stars. Coming from the dining desert of the Grand Canyon, Rivea was just what the doctor ordered.
Service was good, but a little bit slow and our main waiter was a bit stiff. But no major issues.
Our food was great with one exception. 
Cold cut trio: simple and delicious.
Mushroom risotto and octopus salad starters: flavor packed with excellent textures. Bigger portions than I expected.
Pizzetta: nothing special and a bit of a disappointment, but we did ask for it without capers, so possibly our fault.
John Dory and Lobster + Purple Chokes mains were right on. Great veg accompaniments. Delicate sauces that highlighted the seafood very well.
Tiramisu was light and not too sweet. With a double espresso and peppermint tea, a perfect conclusion.
Worth mentioning that our 5 year old made it thru the meal with little drama. The host staff were awesome with her.
Just over 3 bills and worth it. We will be back.
