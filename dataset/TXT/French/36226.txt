hzyvL2v97xLzLbLXcdi1uw We were in a hurry, and they served us quickly. Everyone had a sweet version of crepes or french toast.  I had the super belgium crepe with cookie butter (where have you been all my life) it came with chocolate and strawberries, drizzled in chocolate.  My daughter had the french toast with goat cheese and raspberry compote, my other daughter had a crepe with honey walnuts & granola, and another friend had the Hally Berry crepe (nutella and strawberries). All fantastic!
