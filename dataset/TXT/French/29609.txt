FChZqoNWuLZr5Lj28Cq7yg Wow! This was really great and unexpected.  My first impressions of the place upon entering was clean, friendly and charming. I had been meaning to try this place in the west end since it opened and today I finally got around to it.
I had half a quiche lorraine and half an order of crepes with brie and dijon bechamel along with the potatoe lyonnaise. I have never had either of these dishes before and both were fantastic! Cooked perfectly.  The potatoes were also great and tasted like more. I tried one of the chocolate desserts and want to go back and get another . This place is a great step up from your local diner. I was here for brunch but will be back again this week. 
My only disappointment is in myself having not gotten here sooner. Check it out. Bring cash.
