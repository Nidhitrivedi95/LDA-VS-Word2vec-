Sr-DO1Nt8X4I4Pjxapwz-g Formerly known as Chives Cafe, this is a hidden gem for weekday lunch. Prices are very reasonable and the food is gourmet. Located in the Stonebridge Manor event venue. Seating is currently inside due to heat but there's a beautiful patio with greenery where lunch is served in cooler weather.
