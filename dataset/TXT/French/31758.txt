The colourful decor and plates and the owner's geniality will surely make you miss your gran-gran. Crepes are made quick with simple fresh ingredients. I've tasted multiple crepes here and ALL are great.

Coffee is from Union so you'll like/hate it depending on your taste.

This place has varied opening hours; during summer time it's open late but rest of the year it closes by 2pm.

Writing this review is already making me crave some crepe.
