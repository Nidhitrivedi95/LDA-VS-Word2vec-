jwYnXuaSqtpiNwyU72Vm9Q I like this place so much next week will be my 3rd week in a row. I can't even begin to describe how fantastic the food is there. The hummus and fattoush salad are simply amazing. The octopus is grilled to perfection, the calamari and dipping sauce are great, the sauteed shrimp is great.... Every time we go we plan to eat a meal but we order to many appetizers that we can't eat a meal.  I also asked for a large fattoush salad to go and this is the only SMART place which puts the salad dressing and crispy pita bread separately for to go. This was a great surprise when I got to work and was expecting to eat a slightly soggy salad the next day. Everything was perfect! 

The first time we went the service was amazing. The second time we went the service was still great except for being greeted at the door by the owner. After waiting 3 minutes without being acknowledged the owner came out, proceeded to continue talking on his phone (loudly), spoke on his phone for a good minute before finally telling the person on the phone to hold, rested the phone on his shoulder while he asked how many we were. After we told him he put his phone back to his ear as he walked us to our table. I'm sorry, but that is just horrible. Put your personal call on hold, seat your customers, and then go back to the telephone.
