rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Brunch here was absolutely perfect. Everything I ate, my comment was "couldnt be any better."
Started with their baguette w/ housemade mango jam and delicous whipped butter. Very few things I love more then a perfect bread. 
Fresh fried raspberry beignets were amazing.
Sourdough waffles with strawberries were the perfect crunchy/chewey texture, yet I would of liked bananas on mine. 
Also ordered their pomme frites which could be the most absolutely perfect traditional french fry.
To top it all off this restaurant is beautiful and aside from being 10 times larger then any french bistro, it really is themed very well. 
Was told wait was 45 and we waited no longer then 20 and the nhl playoffs were on tv. Just an amazing place and I cant wait to try the beverly hills and yountville locations.
