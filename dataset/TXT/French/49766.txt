oS96aJIHFWcFAlGHKKXjaw Love. This. Place.  Not many bakeries do everything perfectly.  Well, La Gourmandine does.  Whether you are looking for breads or pastries, everything in this place is amazing. 

We recently had a get together and everyone was asking where the bread was from because it was so amazing.  I can't say I have had that before.... Bread is usually bread.  They have a few different types of baguettes there- and all are yummy.  Some of our fave pastries are: macaroon aux fruits, the citrus tart, raspberry tart, marquise, mousse de framboise and a seasonal one they don't seem to have now the religiuse de caramel (I butchered the spelling on that one). Everything truly is spectacular. 

Visits here have become part of our weekend routine. I suggest getting there early in case they sell out of anything. You won't be disappointed!!!!
