Food: breakfast selection is limited and not very inspired. The duck confit is great if you like very salty food.

Maybe it's the fact that it's a restaurant in a hotel. I don't know. I'm not planning a second visit. DBar still gets my vote as a great place for drinks with colleagues or a date but Boulud gets a thumbs down - not at all aligned with the vibe of the rest of the hotel.
