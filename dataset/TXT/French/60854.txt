SD7vTf-H00J8BS3L-kt7jg This restaurant is both fun and delicious.  The architecture is beautiful and we liked everything we ordered.  We had oysters, tartare (beef, salmon and tuna), beef carpaccio, and scallop tadakis. Cocktails were yummy and they have a variety of wines to choose from.  This place is on the pricey side, but I would recommend.
