sARavfidmIS878q5BtlyVQ As others here have said you are treated like royalty by the staff.  Of the the 8 in my seating my wife and I were the only ones to go with the basic wine pairing ($120/person), though they had options if $300/person and I believe $500/person.  The wine was amazing and the knowledge of the sommelier was astounding.  

The food is unlike anything you have had before, unless you have been to e' before, and someone from my group had been.  The 26 courses will fly by and the way the staff changes the food will boggle your mind and have you remembering it forever.  Now a few things I didn't enjoy, but I know thats my particular palette and shouldn't be held against e' and it's amazing staff.
