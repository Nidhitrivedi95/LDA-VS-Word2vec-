XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q After hitting the tables pretty hard and bouncing around several spots getting appetizers we walked in here. Let just say we were intimated at first as I was not wearing a three piece suit. But we sat up at the bar and immediately felt welcomed by the wait staff. The staff let me try foie gras then paired me up with some great wine and most of the items I tried didn't cost me anything, that's what you get when your nice to everyone I guess. But every single thing from the bread to the deserts was rich in taste and were five stars easy. This is one of the nicest 5 star restaurants I have ever been to in my life so far. Try the tea when your meal is done they have a lot of rare Asian varieties and are served from a cool looking iron pot. When in Vegas and you got the clams to spend check this joint out I'm glad I did.
