8xCiibfgqy-8xpCWEaguqg This is my favorite steakhouse!
Food is always consistently good, fittingly priced, service is top notch - all in a beautiful, stylish, spacious decor downtown.

This place is always buzzing, extremely popular for business folks in the area. They do not take reservations on fridays or saturdays nor special event days. Waiting time for an average evening is usually 30 mins to an hour. You can either hang at the bar while you wait or I would suggest sitting outside, or right below in the Pace Ville Marie mall, there are some comfortable seats near the food court.

I usually get a filet mignon or other tender cut of meat along with baked potato, cesar salad. Meat is always cooked just right and seasoned perfectly. Their filet mignon truly feels like butter. 
For appetizers, I''ve tried their garlic butter shrimps, with melted cheese on top - comes in a cute little plate, absolutely delicious. 
They also serve a basket of warm bread for every table which I love. Bread is so soft and warm, butter melts right on it. There are other pricey steakhouses that do not serve bread so this is a detail that sets The Keg apart.

If you're in the mood for desert but don't know what to pick, they have a sampler of 3 different things, cake, mouse and creme brulee. All are very good.

The Keg is always a good choice for a date or special occasion, it's delicious food, great service, superb ambiance and location.
