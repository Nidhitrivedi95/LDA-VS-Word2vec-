mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q Loved my dinner here! We ordered the seasonal tasting menu (186$/pp) and everything was delicious! Sitting at the bar we got to see the chefs cooking and plating the food which was pretty cool. You can see how much effort and time is put into each dish which makes you understand why the high prices! When the plates came out they looked small, but we were stuffed at the end of our dinner, my favorite dishes of the seasonal
Tasting menu were the sea bass and the foie gras stuffed quail. The mashed potatoes that came with it were heaven = 80% butter 20% potatoes. Can't wait to try Joel Robuchon next door!
