SD7vTf-H00J8BS3L-kt7jg Awesome meal! Friendly, fast service! Starting cocktails were delicious and the wine list is great, reasonably priced. We had delicious oysters to start! I had the beef tartare - awesome. My friend had the burger which he said was one of the best he's had... and the cheesy mashed potatoes are to die for!! Highlight though was the dessert.. their homemade soft serve ice cream with caramel and chocolate drizzle - wow! I love soft serve and this was incredible! Will definitely go back, super atmosphere!
