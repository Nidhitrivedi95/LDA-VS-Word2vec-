UpEVdq_euH-5mqCIgUAd2Q J'adore Le Pappillon on Front!!! My fiance and I have been here two Valentine's Days in a row and are likely going to make this a tradition.  I'd been here years ago and had had a wonderful experience which was why I booked us a table last year.  Each time, the service has been incredible, from the time you're greeted at the door to the time you get your bill.  The food is exquisite, reasonably priced and artfully arranged. I have dreams about the chicken in the peach brandy sauce and the chocolate mousse is the most ridiculously delicious dessert I've ever had. You'd also think that because it's a busy night, they would have limited the menu or the food would have tasted like it had been prepped earlier and sat around to save time.  Not the case, the service was prompt, the food fresh and the server checked in with us more than once.
 The restaurant itself is quite big but still is cozy and warm feeling.  It's nicely lit, not so dark you can't see your food or your friends but dim enough to be a nice romantic setting. I love this place and we'll be back, likely long before the next Valentine's Day.
