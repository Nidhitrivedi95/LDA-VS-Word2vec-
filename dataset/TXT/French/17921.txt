A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g Really tasty food! The French onion soup was fantastic, the quiche lorraine was yummy and the macaroons are absolutely delicious! But what really sets this place apart is the amazing customer service, literally every single person was insanely polite! We will be back again and again.
