bzbNGyrTwWHAgg1CqkSgeg Terrace Cafe is a great brunch spot.  We stopped in here a Saturday morning/afternoon to get some brunch and of course mimosas.  We you first walk in, you see a bar, some seating on ground level, and then an exposed upstairs which is where we sat.  This place just feels new and clean, while still having some charm to it.
      The food here is awesome.  I had the red velvet waffle and the lady had the eggs benedict  The egg was poached nicely, but the red velvte waffle reigned supreme. I honestly wanted to lather my body with the cream cheese drizzle, though I don't know what unwanted person I may attract.
     The food, mimosas, and the service were great.  I aso distinctly remember the odd shaped glasses for some reason. The only thing that put me off a little bit is the price.  It was a bit higher for brunch, but you do get what you pay for.  Overall I would definitely return.
