AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw We came here for breakfast on a Sunday morning. I'm glad they are open early because we had trouble finding a decent breakfast spot that is open before 11. 
The restaurant is cozy, but has a swanky feel. I really liked the vibe of the restaurant. 

I had the Lobster Eggs Benedict. The benedict was on a croissant instead of an English muffin which was a nice upgrade. The croissant was the flakiest croissant I've ever had. The amount of lobster on top was generous. I loved the combination of the croissant, over easy egg, hollandaise, and lobster. Based on the lobster portion I'd say it was reasonably priced.

My husband had the Brioche French Toast with berries and whipped cream. My husband really liked the taste of the entrée, but the portion was too small for the price. 

I'm not knocking a star for this, but they should also make sure dishes get cleaned properly. My water had a really odd smell (fishy) that stopped me from drinking it. My husband's water was fine, but mine obviously had something gross happening.
