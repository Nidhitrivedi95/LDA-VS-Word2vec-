eDtBCZDo92LqBCIfE45hhg One of the best meals I've had in a long time...

I spotted the charming stone courtyard from the street, humming with the chatter of patrons beneath the vines and I immediately looked at the menu. Moments later, I found myself in said courtyard, greeted by friendly hosts and waitstaff. I ordered the grilled octopus appetizer with cucumber, fennel, yogurt, and lime. When the dish arrived I was so pleased, not only with the presentation but with the large pieces of octopus (definitely not grilled baby octopus, which is pretty much all I've had as of recent). It was one of the most amazing dishes I think I have ever tasted. The fennel and cucumber worked so nicely together against the grilled meat...and the citrus of the lime plus the cool yogurt only added to the experience. I then moved onto my main entree, for which i ordered the Quebec mackerel with gherkins, cucumber, wild garlic, and fresh dill. This was also amazing and I savored every bite. I especially loved the unexpected use of gherkins, contrasted against the fresh dill and cucumber which was like a deconstructed pickle. 

Overall, the experience was fantastic. I tried the desaccord pairing and had a very nice glass of rose with my appetizer and the Barbera Piemonte with my main. I was absolutely enamored with how fresh all of the ingredients were. 

I would highly recommend this spot to anyone.
