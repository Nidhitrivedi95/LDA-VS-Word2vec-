UxWH8zRYIBgs6Q2oykvRdw Great interior design, lovely atmosphere, friendly staff, very good service but just average food is all I can say about this place.

we were there for brunch with a group of people and just dropped in with no reservation; the server was very friendly, with great recommendations;

We ordered different dishes and few of their cocktails; the steak was very dry and salty, Caesars Salad was just OK; cannot remember what other friends ordered exactly but they were all saying the same thing that it was just an average food for the price.

Their bread selection was amazing and we loved the bread and butter that was served right before our food.
