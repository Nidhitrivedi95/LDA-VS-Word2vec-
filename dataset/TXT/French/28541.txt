ehRigNzlkRQlvhzKr7PLCQ I had the pleasure of having breakfast here yesterday and meeting the owner, Chanthy. First of all, it warms my heart to know that this sweet lady uses every dime the restaurant makes to help kids in the community. The entire wait staff is helpful, friendly and they volunteer their time. The food is delicious and the prices are unbelievably low. Kudos Chanthy for your warm heart and loving personality, may the idea of Kit's Kitchen spread throughout the world!
