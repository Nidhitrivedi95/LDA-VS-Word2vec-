4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Such an adorned Parisian brassiere at the beautiful Paris Hotel, this little gem has prime time outdoor seating just across from the beautiful Bellagio water show. I think Mon Ami Gabi is a classic replica of a Parisian brassiere with patio dining being the most popular amongst visiting tourists. I wanted to be seated outdoors and we were lucky - yet unlucky at the same time - to be seated in what I thought was going to be a romantic luncheon was burdened by an annoying street magician.

A well sized pâtè accompanied by cornichons, whole grain mustard, and warm country bread, I thought this dish was put together very well as a light early lunch. I like gamy pâtè and for those who are not fond of gamy flavour, the mustard had the right spice that can assist on sizzling the gamy-ness away.

I had some of my date's pomme frites and I thought they were great. They were not fried in duck fat, but still tasted great to me. 

If only they could ask the street magician to move to another location I'd be happy, but I think Mon Ami Gabi is just one of those restaurants that you 'must try' in Las Vegas at least once x
