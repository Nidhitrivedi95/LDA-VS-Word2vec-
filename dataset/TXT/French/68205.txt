vg55SAkrEmuHpWfIMtJjBQ Absolutely delectable ! On here for a special night out , we had a blast. The service was efficient , and the gentleman who served us was really nice. The good was delicious. We had the duck confit and a chicken special they had that day !!! The caramel brûlée dessert they had was out of the world ! We are planning to try butter joint sometime too, heard they have good burgers and drinks.
