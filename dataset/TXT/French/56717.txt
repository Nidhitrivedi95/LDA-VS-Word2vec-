rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I am the biggest fan of Bouchon Bakery. Their food is high-quality, unique, and very decadent. However, when dining at the Bouchon Restaurant at Venetian, I was disappointed in my meal and will not be returning.

The staff was nice, as expected at a higher-end brunch spot. However, the food is incredibly sub-par. My party ordered: 
-Cobb Salad: completely ordinary; the chicken was fairly dry, the dressing was very standard, as if out of a bottle; the avocado was extremely limited, and the portion was quite far from generous (even for a higher-end restaurant)
-Mixed Greens Salad: once again ordinary
-Fruit Salad: fresh fruit, can't go wrong!

Unfortunately, the food did not spark my interest at all. And despite the polite staff, their menu was below expectations.
