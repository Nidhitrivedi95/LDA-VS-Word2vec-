pmoIMK8zGWvKsVOPDBYfzg Top notch experience from start to finish.  My wife and I celebrated our anniversary and they did not disappoint.  If you are into foie gras I highly recommend the foie gras martini which I had the fortune that night of having with truffle.  The combination of the fat from the foie gras and the vodka made for an interesting buzz.  Worth every bit of the $18.  I would advise not having more foie gras as an appetizer as I was in overload.  The rabbit was excellent served with a bold reduction.  Although a bit small, the restaurant offered the necessary ambiance for the occasion.  Left feeling satisfied without the necessity to feel full doing so.
