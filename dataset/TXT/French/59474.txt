RZk_PE-H9SygqwSQd88cWQ Solid three stars for both service and food! Neither is too shabby, but it's still midrange. Decent selection of drinks as well. The portion sizes are actually really great, however, fries and salad are a bit 'over-featured' while the 'main parts' (protein) are small. The soup is pretty nice. The environment is that of an older cafe, and frequented by an older crowd, but it beats many other Montreal establishments (in that their fries are crisp (not soggy) and crunchy).
