Fried Zucchini: Unlike some of the more typical renditions of this app, the fried zucchini here is thin like a potato chip and is fried in beer batter.
Stirfry: Heaping vegetables with brown rice in an Asian-style sauce! Being Asian myself, my standards are pretty high, and I loved this dish here (definitely not authentic, but very tasty!).
Smoked Brisket Sandwich: Smoked brisket with BBQ sauce with aged provolone. I thought that the bread:meat ratio was a little off, but the brisket was delicious! It came with a side of tortilla chips and house salsa that was refreshing.

BD is definitely on my list of "to return" before I leave Pittsburgh. They also offer other inventive dishes and have rotating specials!
