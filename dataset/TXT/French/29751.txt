fFInb4Dl2Ix4iE-VOltbkQ Verses is absolutely brilliant. They are conveniently located in Old Montreal and serve an adjoining hotel. They sat my wife (and baby) and I at the perfect table (for us and other guests) on a very busy Thursday evening. The staff was very polite, accommodating, and eager to serve.
I don't know what to say about the dining experience other than it was exquisite. We had lamb tartare, scallops, veal, the fish special, and a smooth carmenere (red wine). I think this menu had been arranged for the igloo festival, and was great. My only regret is not getting the lamb chops I'd had my eye on. It's a rare occasion, but my wife out-ordered me this time.
The speed of service was very relaxed. If you're coming from the states, don't expect one course to follow immediately after another. They allow time for things to settle, and even for you to chat a bit over your wine. Don't be in a rush, and let things flow at their own pace.
Finally, the pricing. I don't think we overpaid in the least. Maybe a bit for the wine, but that is standard in the restaurant industry. The skill of preparation and presentation was certainly worth what we paid. Even with all the variety, we'd love to visit again next time we're in town.
