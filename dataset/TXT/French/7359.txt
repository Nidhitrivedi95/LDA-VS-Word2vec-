4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw My cousin and I had eaten here before but it was better this time around than I had remembered. We stayed at Paris this time so it was conveniently located in their casino. We shared the Butter Lettuce and Apple Salad to start and it was really good. They also brought us a solid amount of bread and butter to hold us over before our food arrived. For our main course, we shared the Filet Mignon in merlot butter and wine reduction and it was AMAZING. Probably the best piece of steak i've ever had. So for that reason alone, this place gets 5 stars! Highly recommend this place and it's easy to make reservations through yelp.
