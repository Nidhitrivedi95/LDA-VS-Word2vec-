j0baDQfMAGDm_QGdFMmb-Q I really enjoyed coming here for a handful of reasons: (1) French! Yes, if you speak (or in my case pretend to) the language, you'll love this hidden gem. The place is tucked back away in a plaza (like everything else in Arizona), but don't let that fool you. The interior of the bistro transports you to a chic place somewhere else in the world. The owners speak French too and will engage you as well (2) Ambience! Lots of great artwork and little reminders of Paris surround you. The music also contributes greatly to the overall experience. (3) Food! Great authentic food really completes the experience--all at a reasonable price.
