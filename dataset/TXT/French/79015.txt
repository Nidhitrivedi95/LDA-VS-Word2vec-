ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug We were pretty excited to get a french breakfast on Saturday morning while we were staying at the Bellagio just in front of Paris... Alas, the surprise was not a good one...

The wait was short, good point... but our waiter took 20 minutes to come ask what we wanted.

Then we saw the eggs benedict at the table next to us.  We looked at each other at the same time: the english muffin were totally burned!  Shortly after the owner of the plate asked for more hollandaise sauce as there was barely any.

Then came my espresso... well that's what I had ordered.  I got some instantaneous coffee instead.  I asked if the machine was broken and they said no.  I then asked to get it exchanged for a regular coffee.  It was as bad but at least I didn't have to pay the $5.50 for my double-espresso.

Then much later came our greasy toast with fake butter and the rest of the order.

If you go there for a french experience, just forget about it.  This place should be avoided at any price.

As a nice alternative, go get your croissants and pains au chocolat next door at Lenotre which is a nice patisserie with nice coffee and pastries.

Enjoy your trip in Vegas!
