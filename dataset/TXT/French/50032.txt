oS96aJIHFWcFAlGHKKXjaw I had a sample of the flan pâtissier, which was not too sweet and a little on the firm side. I chose to buy a zephyr and a dozen of mini chouqhettes instead. The mini chouquettes I got happen to be straight out of the oven, so it was so heavenly. The zephyr was tart and not too sweet at all. The marzipan mixture was perfect to offset the tartness of the raspberry. In general, all of their baked goods are freshly made, light, and fluffy. Would recommend to anyone who enjoys baked goods.
