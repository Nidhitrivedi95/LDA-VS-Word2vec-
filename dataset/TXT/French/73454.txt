A must try is the 20 grams Osetra Royal Caviar, solid. They even provided a golden spoon just for Caviar. My favorite, as always, was the foie gras, so creamy and melted in your mouth. My New York Steak took a little long but the Beef was juicy. Our server was very professional and attentive. Plus, the view of Bellagio fountain from above was pleasant.
