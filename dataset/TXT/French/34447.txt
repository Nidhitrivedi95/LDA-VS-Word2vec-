HOev_2CifUcfIm9xDL_uaw Food! Service! Atmosphere! 
This is a hidden gem of a place and worth a visit for those tired of the regular recycle of local American food. 

The atmosphere is cozy and homely, it feels like stopping by a cherished relative's place for a home cooked meal. There is nothing flashy here and if you are used to valet service, there are other restaurants north of here. 

The menu is mostly sandwich type items, but there is a good selection from ham and goat cheese, to salmon and cream cheese creations worth a taste. Deserts here are a delight, and nothing feels over priced. 

Unfortunately, the staff is limited so on busy days you may have to wait a little longer for service but I have never had a bad experience and always felt welcomed. I'll be coming back to try more items on the menu for sure. Bon Appétit!
