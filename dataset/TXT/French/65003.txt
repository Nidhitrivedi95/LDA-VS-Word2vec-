Tl2nqtPXlLbAG3qkUYVM2g My first visit here was to have a business meeting to try and wine and dine a high value client. I didn't know what to expect, but I was very happy with this choice. The dinner was delicious and the service was so professional. We had a wide selection of dishes and there wasn't anything I tasted that wasn't a wonderful flavor experience. 
The best part was being able to talk to our client without having to raise voices. I am so glad to have found a place where we don't have to talk over the crowd or compete loud ambient music. We closed the deal with our client and they were very pleased with the evening. What more could I ask for? Great meal and close the deal!
