UWupVhvb1qWZh8rNowJliQ A nice little restaurant in the St Lawrence Market area. The entrance was quite hidden, thought I was walking into another building. The restaurant advertise as proudly Canadian - only use ingredients from locals in Canada. The menu had a lot of variety. I was in between a few items but end of selecting the ROASTED MUSCOVY DUCK BREAST with crispy confit, dried cherries and duck egg béarnaise. The sauce was sour and sweet from the dried cherries. The duck confit was really crispy and the duck breast itself was very tender. The dish was quite delicious.

We ended up sharing a dessert - RASPBERRY 'MACARONNADE' - Mascarpone Mousse, Basil Ice Cream, Macaroon, Raspberry Tuile, Textures Of raspberry, salted pine nuts. It was a raspberry mousse in a jar with basil ice cream on the side. They advertise on the menu that there is macaroon, didn't see one, maybe it is mixed in the mousse.

The service was great. Great atmosphere for catching up with friend, not too noisy.
