rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I've tried both brunch and dinner at Bouchon, and I'd rather go for Brunch; its better and less expensive. The brunch is nothing like Thomas Keller's Ad Hoc, but it's not horrible. I usually order the Croque Madame, and it is always really good. The bread is thick so it soaks up all the flavors of the meat, and the runny creamy yolk. Yum! I'm giving Bouchon 3 stars because dinner (been twice) is expensive ($75+) and all the dishes are simply forgettable. All I remember from dinner is the complimentary bread (which is always fresh and hot!) and the Terrine Foie Gras, which was decent. I recently ordered a pork dish, and it was not that great... Lacked flavor. And I was trying other friends dishes and I didn't find one I loved either! :(  I've decided that I would probably only come back here for Brunch...
