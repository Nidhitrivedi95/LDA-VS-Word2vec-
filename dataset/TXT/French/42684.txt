LjOBNcNNpuewBqSPxYYTJQ I was very excited to visit Amelie's but left with the thought that I will not return. Paid top dollar for 2 pastries plus 2 caramel brownies. Not a problem if they are out of this world. Not. The lemon meringue tasted like something which could be bought at Harris Teeter. NOT a compliment. The caramel brownies were so sweet they were inedible according both my husband and me. I have visited the NoDa location once and had a good memory of their pastries but the fruit pastries on Carmel Rd location looked not fresh. Shame on you Amelie's. All hopes for a decent bakery on the south side of town is gone.
