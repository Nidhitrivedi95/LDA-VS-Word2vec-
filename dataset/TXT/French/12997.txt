We were lured in with the cool breeze but for some reason I wanted to sit outside.  It was a mistake because it was scorching hot but also a good decision because we got to watch the water show at the Bellagio at least twice during our meal.  

I thought the price was surprisingly fair for being a restaurant located on the strip.  We order escargot (favorite), chilled seafood platter, grilled salmon and spinach salad, and of course a glass of wine for me.  The total was slightly north of $100.

The escargot was pretty good, it was softer and less chewy than other placed tried.  The seafood platter was amazing, it came with maine lobster, jumbo shrimp, oysters, and salmon tartare.  This dish was shared between three people.  And lastly, we had the grilled salmon salad which was delish.  It had avocado, walnuts, blueberries, and a citrus dressing, so good.

I will definitely make a stop the next time I visit Vegas.
