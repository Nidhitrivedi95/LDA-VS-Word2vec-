qTacF-_Iucc1Nxom_Za_5Q I loved it!  The food was really delicious (great for sharing!) and the service was really great (super friendly and knowledgeable staff).  The prices were not cheap but to be expected for the quality of food they serve. I would definitely recommend it and will be be back soon!
