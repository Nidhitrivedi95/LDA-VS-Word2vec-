h28ZxheMQdpqHcAw_ge6gw So glad I decided to give Bacchanal a try on Friday night - French cuisine is not normally my go-to. 

The restaurant is situated in a brand new space, on the ground floor on Sudbury street - very easy to find, and lots of space once inside. The decor inside Bacchanal is extremely unique, and fits the chic vibe. All details were considered with the design, going down to the cutlery, which is gold. 

The service was outstanding. The waiter quickly picked up that I did not speak French, or have a solid understanding of French cuisine. He was extremely patient and descriptive of the entire menu (yes, the entire menu) and took the time to walk through each dish. I can't say many restaurants offer this same service - Bacchanal has raised the bar. 

As far as the food is concerned - everything ordered was above par, with generous portion sizes (please refer to pictures). The presentation of the food was immaculate - each vegetable on the plate was placed immaculately. 

Dessert was also a home run. Lots of options to choose from, and all sounded tasty. 

Looking forward to my next visit for sure!
