SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ We discovered House of Tricks at the gourmet food festival "Devoured". They served a zesty prawn on a bed of grits with kimchee. Sounds bizarre but it was fabulous. This inspired us to swing by Saturday night  on a hungry impulse. We could have wept when we saw the aforementioned prawn dish on the appetizer menu. It was better than we remembered. Next we had the Korean BBQ ribs. The portion was quite large and the flavors suprisingly bold and bright. We finished our meal with a house salad and duck. 
I love good food. I love House of Tricks. This is a special date night, or freinds coming to town kind of place. The patio dining is romantic and I was impressed that our fellow diners were a multinational bunch. This shows the broad appeal of the delicious food. Our service was very good. This place is a winner and we will definitely return!
