xcmmTXhuMx2fZF2Bt69F4w Disclaimer first: I am not a fan of Belgian beer, so this takes some of the fun out of the place. 

But I like mussels, and I do mussels well, and I know mussels. So, I guess I am decent judge of the place.

I liked their mussels (went for the traditional sauce), and the mayo for the fries was very good (mayo matters, folks). The fries themselves were tasty, and seemed fresh (meaning not from a frozen pack). So, go there for the mussels if you like mussels. And if you dig Belgian beer, you'll like the place more than me.

It's also a nice restaurant, although for some reason my seat was vibrating for most of the evening. Wonder what was on the other side of the wall. 

Still, I'd give only 3 stars. It's a bit pricey for mussels. And one of my dinner partners did not like her dish (lamb I think).
