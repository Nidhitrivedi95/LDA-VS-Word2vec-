rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A More deserving of 3.5 stars. Perhaps I need to come here for a dinner date and not for brunch...hungover? 

We came here for brunch last Sat morning. Our party of 12 had to wait for about 40 minutes. Not too bad I guess, considering how big our group was. But really...there weren't that many diners in the restaurant. There were plenty of open tables inside AND out. Eventually, we were seated in a private dining room in the back. The thing that annoyed me most was that the front desk hostess kept giving us false time frames on when our table would be ready. 

So, let's talk food. Our waitress was a sweetheart and she knew how to sell the menu! I was salivating when she described the dishes to us. Eventually, I settled for the sourdough waffles with fresh strawberries. YUMMY and definitely filling. It came with a side of Tahitian vanilla bean butter!! Yes!!!  I couldn't finish my plate, but perhaps it was because I was was feeling queezy from the night's booze fest. A popular dish at our table was the corned beef hash. Again, large portions. Their beef was a bit dry though. 

Don't miss out on their drink menu...it's quite unique and tasty!
