O3OH5IEFMPtz7mPKakPZ3Q This place is a hidden gem! Our server, Sarah, was amazing! She knew everything there is to know about the menu! If you aren't familiar with Japanese/French fusion cuisine then ask for Sarah. You cannot come here without ordering the bone marrow filet! We will definitely be back!
