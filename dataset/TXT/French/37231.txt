IvFdi-vp823dTAWwHMT6xQ Possibly the worst communicating I've ever seen in my entire foodie life. I'm not usually this mean, but from stepping into the restaurant to getting seated was the worst! 

The lady decided to put us at the back of the entire room while there was room at the front to watch performances. Note that we did do reservations for a Father's Day event. Why should my father and his family be sitting in the back where there is no lighting, while you have tons of tables at the front where there is sufficient lighting to see what you're eating?! 

As I got seated, I realized I had this candle sitting in front of my face and it was really starting to burn up and i just have smoke running through my nose. I blew it out and the waiter decided it would be fun to re-light it again. I told him that it has been smoke up my face for a very long time now. He finally understood the hint.

The food was not really great and the soup tasted like it was from a canned soup. I had the Clam Chowder while my family got the Lobster Bisque. Tasted really thick and just didn't like it at all. The food was overpriced for what you get.

One positive mention is that they had Karaoke night on a Friday and the singer was really good. It seems that there are the many regulars who come here to eat and then sing after and have a good time. The atmosphere after the dinner was very nice and relaxing. 

Not recommending people who want to have good food to come here.
