tCSlpwJQ4CZsUEMZeH2SFg My husband and I eat regularly at Cafe Monte because it is one of our favorite restaurants.  Yesterday I ordered an omelette with egg whites.  Half way through my meal, our server, Jennifer G came very apologetically to our table and said that she had discovered that the kitchen had made the omelette with whole eggs.  She had the kitchen re-make the entire meal, which I took home and had for dinner.  Both Jennifer and the manager were so very apologetic and took the meal off of our bill.  The service is always like this at our fave restaurant.
