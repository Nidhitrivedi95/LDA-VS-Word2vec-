bEVWHtBRYVwqaaNF4mWNYg Oh how I adore this place, if you read my reviews you may notice a pattern. I'm a sucker for a nice terrace, and this restaurant has a really nice one. Imagine this, it's a warm evening in July  and your sitting on wonderful terrace on a busy pedestrian intersection with a nice bowl of french onion soup. Ah delightful!
