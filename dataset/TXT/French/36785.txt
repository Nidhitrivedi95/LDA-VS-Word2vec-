iEsNloJgy-MyA-_wqeB6jg We had been here a few years ago and enjoyed the food and service. Something has obviously changed, as they were both quite bad this past Valentine's Day. The Caesar was not made at table and was limp and overdressed. The oysters were served with cocktail sauce and not mignonette or even a lemon wedge. The entrees were bland- each of the four our party reached for the salt immediately. Not a good sign! The waitstaff were terribly clumsy with the geridon, slamming into our chairs and blocking one of our party from his seat when he returned from the restroom. The menus are held together with scotch tape and the decor is reminiscent of someone's rec room. The music was on a short forty five minute loop. We were not offered coffee even though we had ordered soufflés with dinner. We had to flag a server down and ended up asking twice for our simple two coffee order. It's painfully obvious that no one has trained the staff. 
What may have once boasted fine French service and cuisine is now an incredibly overpriced, mediocre, sad and old restaurant. I can't possibly recommend this establishment to anyone.
