ysJo5Jdo29XOBCnKrbUKWg Came here a while back for brunch and it was decent. I enjoyed the ambiance, but expected more from the food. I had the Paris 66 brunch which came with a palmier, crepe, and scrambled eggs. The eggs were watery, but the rest of the plate was okay. I would consider coming back here to try their other food.
