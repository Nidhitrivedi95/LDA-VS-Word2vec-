USleI8g1UVN9-9jm-b4uIg Went here for my wife's birthday. Was very, very nice. Would definitely recommend for a special occasion as it is very pricey, but the service was excellent. We sat upstairs in a room that had three tables, but wish we had sat outside (that's our mistake, not theirs though) Had two drinks, their version of a Manhattan (The Bostic) was terrific, smokey and delicious. Wife had the Local Honey which was very tasty and the server recommended a glass of wine after finding out what type of wine my wife liked. Had the beet carpaccio for an appetizer, which was very good if a bit of a small portion, but it was very fresh and bright. I ordered the elk chop which was EXCELLENT and a must-get if you're there, wife ordered the lobster thermidor which was very good as well. Had the beignets for dessert and yes they wrote Happy Birthday in chocolate. Overall, it was a very enjoyable experience, but now that we've been once, we probably will try somewhere else. 

Definitely worth going to, though.
