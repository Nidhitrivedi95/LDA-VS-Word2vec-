htQgj-ANQpZGpIpkkrEmyQ Has a downtown feel even though its located in the burbs. Very unique menu with funky items you just want to try.  Price isn't bad for the burbs. Seating is limited so be sure to make a reservation. They also close a bit early. We went here for my friend's birthday, got a 8:30pm reservation since it was the only one available for a Friday night. We chatted till they physically had to ask us to leave since they were closing. LOL. Overall, great food and friendly staff that served us.
