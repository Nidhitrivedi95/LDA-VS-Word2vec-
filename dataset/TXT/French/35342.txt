Ht-_i0UAq7YDBaqJwcQMdQ My boyfriend and I came here to celebrate our anniversary. The restaurant is in the Old Port section of Montreal just one street east of Place Jacques Cartier so even before you arrive, the walk in the surrounding area is quite beautiful. We were greeted warmly at the door and continued to have above par service all night. This is a fine dining establishment and is on the more expensive side of dining out but the quality of food, service and ambience are enough to create an experience that justifies the money you are spending. We had oysters 3 ways, foie gras, chasse et peche (sweetbreads, lobster meat, over a lobster ravioli) and two different chocolate desserts. As well as some cheese after dinner to finish our wine. Everything was cooked to perfection and the flavours were all incredible even when I thought they might not be my favourite. Little touches like automatically splitting our four gras appetizer for us without having to ask and after overhearing is trying to decide between two desserts simply bringing both out to us (we had only ordered one of them) made this experience exceptional. Highly recommended to any and all.
