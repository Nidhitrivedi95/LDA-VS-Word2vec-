m4PW-GMc8JOU5nmMYncu-Q Le Lab is a pretty fantastic spot to grab a cocktail or to 'drink' outside the box with the absinthe experience or a flaming shot. 

We took a seat at the welcoming bar and right away were served cucumber water. Very nice touch. Everything about this place with a sexy, lounge-y, dark, speakeasy vibe was really quite perfect. The mood lighting, the playful French music, the modern meets vintage feel, the handsome bartenders clad in prohibition era garb and of course the very extensive cocktail menu with some incredibly innovative gems as well as some seasonal specials on the chalkboard menu. 

This place has the best of both worlds... a perfect mix of old meets new which I am such a fan of. It's done so incredibly right here. For example, they offer an entire page of just gins and classic hard drinks, but also a plethora of carefully crafted cocktails as well as an entire page of ones they light on fire! Le Lab also has a few modern touches such as subway tiles, geometric tiles and exposed brick as well as vintage photos, a vintage cash register, textured wallpaper and ornate mirrors and vanities. Love it! A ton of personality is found here in the decor, the offerings and even the wording in the menu. 

We each chose one of their creative cocktails for $15 Canadian we absolutely LOVED!! 

"Pumpkin Paste" which had butter orange Regans, purée de courage, gingerbread syrup, dry Curaçao, Pierre Fernrand & Couvoisier 

"Matcha Misu" which was topped with matcha powder and coconut. It had mascarpone in it! 

A lot of thought went into the design of every single aspect of the place right down to the drink garnish. This is not just a bar, it's an experience. 

If I lived here this would absolutely be my favorite place to grab a drink and I highly, highly recommend stopping by here! Perfect date night spot.
