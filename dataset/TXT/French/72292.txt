XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q Imagine having one of the best meals of your life. This is what it's like at Joel Robuchon @ the mansion. 16 courses....wine...almost 1k spent....totally worth it! This along with L'atelier, opened next door are the first 2 restaurants that he has ever opened in the United States. It's definitely something that you must experience at least once in your life. Well...maybe twice.
