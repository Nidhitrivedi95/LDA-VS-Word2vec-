Yes it's a beer place but they should have at least 1 gluten free choice! 

It's a typical car with a twist to make look different with a section that they make there own beer and you can see the stainless steel cylinders through the glass, it's a nice touch. 

I ordered a burger and fries with no bread and it does say 7oz but it looked more like 4oz! 
It might have started at 7oz but when you say on the menu it's a 7oz burger you want a 7oz burger looking at you! 

Really the best part and experience was MEGAN at the bar who came over and told me and explained all the gluten free options and she knew her stuff which was great, for that service experience I am rating it as a 3 star and possible 4. 
Overall the good is not that good and the fries were not full. And come on, the fries are one of the cheapest things that have  great profit for restaurants so just fill up the container, don't be that cheap. Your paying $13-17 for a burger and fries you should get your monies worth. 

If your a beer drinker then I guess it's a great place but that's not what most people are looking for.  

They need to step it up a notch!
