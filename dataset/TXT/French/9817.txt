4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw If you get to eat here, I hope your waiter is François. What a pleasure he was during our dining experience. He even spoke to us in French throughout our evening. The restaurant is set up very nicely and gives off a cute Paris vibe inside. The filet mignon was very tender and cooked perfectly, as well as the dijon mustard steak frites which I would highly suggest. The portions are large so it is well worth the price you are paying. Will definitely come back. Merci, François!
