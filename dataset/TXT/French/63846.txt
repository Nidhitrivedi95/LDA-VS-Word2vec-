T4g4k2OhCTsiqcP-ZXElHQ I've eaten here quite a few times over a number of years now and Jules is one of our regular spots now for casual, authentic french fare. Ingredients are simple and the food is fresh. 

 I am not a huge meat eater so I adore the crepes and the french fries are delish with the mayo dip. Can't say I eat my healthiest when I am there but its a treat. The meat dishes are quite good though whether its the quail or chicken cooked in butter and bacon..hey, you can always opt for the side salad! The only thing I'm not really a fan of is their ceviches. I think they should experiment with different, perhaps sweeter flavours? Some of the desserts are on the counter for you to eyeball and drool over. 

I only wish they would offer fois grois - perhaps just sometimes, as one of their specials. I know they try to keep the costs down as its not supposed to be a pricey restaurant but fois grois is my weakness and ironic since Im not much of a meat eater!
Oh and would also be great if they could use organic meat but again, that would drive the cost up. 

We usually sit at the counter and watch them cook. We've made new friends sitting at the communal bench - most fit the definition of a regular more than we do. Its a very nice atmosphere  and the restaurant is super cute. If you are there around closing then they crank up the tunes and start belting them out. Fun times!
