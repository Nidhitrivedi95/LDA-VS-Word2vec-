3jKUbhGSjFTv5jZ0wnW0xA Pub like ...ahhhh... Bistro like atmosphere and a bit noisey but oh, the food! If you want a great French Canadian meal in a restaurant that has more locals than tourists this is the place. My wife started with pumpkin mushroom soup which was both delicate and flavorful. Salmon tartar as an entree or main dish was uniquely delicious. I had duck confit which was both crispy yet moist, perfectly cooked. Others in the party enjoyed veal stew not leaving a bite. Not to go on and on deserts were all fantastic. The wait staff were open and friendly but maybe not too attentive, no problem, we talked and laughed and were not pressured. The owner, Tim, is an American expatriate who spent time with us providing a lot of laughs. 
If you want a quiet, elegant, tourist oriented meal in Old Montreal take one star off my rating but don't let that deter you from going!
