rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Came here with my girlfriends for brunch while on our Vegas trip! 

Loved the decor of the place! And every dish we ordered was really good. But I would have to say that their pastries are the best! We love their Pecan Sticky Bun. Too bad they don't have the sticky buns at the bouchon's here in LA!
