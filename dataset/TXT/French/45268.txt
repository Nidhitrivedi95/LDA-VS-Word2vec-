  I have dined at Joel Robuchon twice and enjoyed the experience very much. My only issues with that restaurant are the price and the very conservative ambiance (kind of awkward for vegas) . The food is phenomenal.
 L'Atelier delivers not only AMAZING dishes it is also fun, with a relaxed atmosphere and much easier on the wallet. 
 We had the 9 course degustation menu for about $150. We sat at the bar over looking the kitchen (very entertaining). Each course was prepared with precision and beauty. The creativity and thought put into each dish was typical Joel Robuchon. 
 This restaurant caters to more adventurous eaters if you are picky this isn't for you. In my opinion with all factors considered this is the best restaurant in Vegas.
