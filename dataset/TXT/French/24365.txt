So lets get down to it. 
The place was packed, make reservations in advance via email.
Wine list is impressive, but go for their house blonde draft.  It's refreshing and crisp.  Perfect for cutting through the richness of the food. 
Started with the pate du campagne and the PDC salad.   The salad was excellent, nicely cooked offals over a bed of greens.  The pate was good, very rustic.  For entrées, the boudin and foie tart and the PDC pot. The tart was rich, decadent, unctuous... take your pick. The pot was great, several sausages and different meats served in a cast iron pot.
Service was good, our server and busser were very friendly.
If you were looking for great Quebecois cuisine, this is it.
