We were greeted jubilantly in French when we entered this cozy, upbeat restaurant. We sat near the front at a tiny table and were handed menus (in French as well). A little uncomfortable, we ordered some local beers (similar to Blue Moon, had a white horse on it) to start. Our waiter kindly explained the food items, what's included in the fixed price lunch, and even took us to the deli window to point out options.

My husband's ham and cheese crepe was fantastic and one of our favorite food items we tasted in Montreal. I chose a sausage/sauerkraut/potatoes dish that was good. Before our plate principal, we were served vegetable soup. It was thick, almost like a puree, but very tasty.

For dessert, we got a waffle type desert (it was fun watching the woman making them) with apple and powdered sugar. Although I would have liked some chocolate with it, it was a nice way to end our meal. 

We were offered a foie gras sample during our visit but declined. Waitstaff seemed happy to be working there and we were happy we stopped in.
