0Xr0kte9ADAfZ-GBO-wimg Ehhh, I've had MUCH better. I almost felt like I was eating a frozen dinner meal. The lamb I ordered was ok, and the veggies on the side- NOT so french. It was steamed cauliflower and carrots with salt and butter. I don't believe I have ever seen that in a french restaurant before (especially in France). This place almost seems more like a tourist trap and we fell for it even though we're not tourist. LOL

Not a fan. Don't plan on going back. I make better food at home.
