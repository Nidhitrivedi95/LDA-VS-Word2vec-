7Ug8zCmY6iDTewxWqeYQ2g Really enjoyed my experience at Le Quartier General. We were a group of 4 and we brought our own wine. The ambiance is classy but casual, kind of felt like I was at a dinner party at someone's house. The food was excellent but I wished there was more! I would definitely go back.
