DOmVF9YKOvTkqjcgUwtOgQ I went here by myself and with my husband a few days later. I had a great time here and the servers were extremely helpful. We enjoyed their Oyster special ( a dozen for $20). They had great food and a great atmosphere. I had a glass of Chardonnay there that I can't find anywhere else, but it was amazing.
