HL6ZzGF7V-KDaU0zziHyEA Upon reading the comments from other Yelpers, I feel I didn't make the best choice from the menu when I went to Maison Boulud. It was a convenient option for me while I was staying in Montreal (nice when the restaurant is in the hotel!). I ordered a rigatoni pasta with alfredo sauce. It was pretty good and I was told the pasta was made fresh which is always a highlight - but oddly I don't think it tasted much different from pre-made pasta. The sauce was quite good but really buttery (make no mistake - I love butter, but twenty minutes into eating my dish I felt the once liquidy sauce started to solidify and at that point it tasted almost exclusively of butter). I felt the dish was missing something - chicken, vegetables perchance? Something to elevate it from simply pasta with a sauce. What I am seeing from the rest of the reviews is that Boulud's protein dishes are divine - which makes me think that next time a burger or a steak if where I should venture. The pictures of the beautifully-presented desserts also look enticing. Given I had a decent experience the first time at Boulud, I'm open to giving it another chance. Until next time, Maison Boulud!
