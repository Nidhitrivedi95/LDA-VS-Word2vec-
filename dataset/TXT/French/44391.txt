ME6D5nLlfG0xZCtICOYDuw I have enjoyed eating at your brasserie for years.
Today we tried you for brunch. Had the Oscar Benedict. Very disappointing. I specifically asked about the crab meat. First waiter said "Oh, we deleted this(CRAB) from dinner menu. Let me check." He then  told me it was jumbo lump from Maryland. I thought OK, this will be good.
When it came it was back fin meat, no lumps and his reply was well," i told you it came from a can mad in USA" If he had , I would never have ordered it. You should either get fresh crab or take off the brunch menu too. English muffin was not even toasted. Hollandaise was great! Yes, I am a foodie and very particular, That is why I asked.
Thanks for the read.
