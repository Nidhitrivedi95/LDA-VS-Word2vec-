6fPQJq4f_yiq1NHn0fd11Q My friend, Deb N., recommended this walk-up window eatery to me while I was sojourning at Bally's. Bally's, for the uninitiated, is linked to the Paris hotel and casino by a charming "pavilion" of shops and eateries.

For the thousands of you who don't know me, my mother is Swedish. From Sweden. This means Swedish pancakes! Swedish pancakes are exactly the same thing as French crepes, but not as "frenchified." So, I'm used to simple presentation and simple fillings.

I was eager to check it out, though. And I couldn't help but branch out (they didn't have a listing for a jelly-filled crepe...) so I ordered the Nutella Crepe. This was the hazelnut paste with a chocolatey goodness layered inside the crepes, while the whole thing was topped off by chocolate sauce, powdered sugar and a dollop of whipped cream.

Background: I had been congested and dreary, sans appetit, for 36 hours. Well, this plate of goodness cheered me right up! Zut alors!!! Sacre bleu!

It was yummy, potentially messy and I ate the whole thing.
