Kut9tVbDX_f7qKMRRoXg3w The soup was lovely. The main course was a Tourtière of duck (canard). Mine was served on a butcher's block with a nice salad of mixed greens and tomato and cucumber. I had a Napolean for dessert, which was also very good. Really nice experience. Low-key, cool waiters/resses, good food, reasonable prices.
