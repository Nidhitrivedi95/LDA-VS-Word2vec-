ZuYsZvJ5r32Fs70vPXbRgw I came her for Summerlicious last night for an early dinner and enjoyed the overall experience. Service was excellent, although they definitely like to encourage wine consumption. 

I wasn't famished when I arrived, which was probably for the best because the tiny portions here are not very filling. Still, getting stuffed isn't my goal and I favour flavour over quantity.

I ordered the following:

Baby Scallop Ceviche, Mint, Grapefruit and Chilies - this was pretty good, but there was something a bit odd about the scallop texture. Maybe they were boiled very briefly? 

Seared Top Sirloin Steak with Comfit Shallots, Pomme Gâteux and Sauce Foyot - the steak as very tough to cut through, and it's a good thing I ordered it rare because it was still more on the medium side. 

My DC ordered the Roast Daurade with Parisian Gnocchi, Peas, Oranges and Espelette Pepper Beurre Blanc and hers was phenomenal - literally "melt in your mouth" texture.

Passion fruit Pot au Crème - definitely the highlight of the meal. As Jean K. Jean would say on SNL: Incroyable!
