JJ1Ruu37kn66YSWUmCKNCw Another great downtown Montreal restaurant. It's a little more on the pricier side, but well worth it. All I had was spaghetti and tomato sauce and fine herbs, which was so good. - Their tomato sauce tasted different than most other ones I've had at other restaurants. 
For dessert my friend and I split a cheesecake with strawberry coulis, and that was very delicious, as well. I rarely ever like to spend that much on cheesecake, but I think I'd make an exception for this place.
Service was just okay. I guess because it's so busy in there that they kind of unintentionally neglect some of the tables or they take forever to come by. The food sure came fast, but otherwise, the servers rarely came by unless we called them over.
