hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA If you love croissants this is the place to go. The croissant are amazing they are light and flaky on the inside and crispy on the outside. Paired with egg and their house tomato compote, heaven!   

It's a small place.  Limited seating.  But oh so worth it.  The staff is very nice and the food is killer.  Limited menu but the draw is the baked pastries.   They also serve homemade quiche and a few desserts in the glass case.  

Will be back!
