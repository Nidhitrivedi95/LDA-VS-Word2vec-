t1mR_Zff6Dqv1TueE2JLEA Went for Summerlicious Lunch Menu.
Tried the 
HARIRA - not bad, soup temperature was good,expected it to be more
spicy or tomato like but was actual very light
MAFTOUL  - pretty much a spring roll, but thinner shaped like a cigarette (for some reason expected it to be a fat cigar shape)
MANGO SALMON  - was salmon (felt like every other salmon dish)
maybe needed more mango (didn't taste it)
MOROC STEAK BAGUETTE - (did not try) but saw that the fries were really burnt 
MOROCCAN TREATS - Strangely the orange slices felt more like a candied version, a bit hard and chewy not like the description of fresh orange slices
BAKLAVA - hard and chewy
Both deserts felt like they were a bit stale.
Sat at the back, nice decor.
