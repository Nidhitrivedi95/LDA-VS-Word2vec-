Ordering when more than two people are waiting is chaotic, with an "order here" sign at one register and a person at another yelling for people to queue up in no man's land, aka at neither. You request "for here" and it comes packaged to go. Your tea comes in a small cup (no pot for you! You're not welcome to stay that long) and when you try to get a bit more hot water they waste a giant takeout cup and fill it just 1/2 full. There's no sandwich soup/salad option so you have to order both or none and the  bread that comes with the soup is so tiny it literally fits in the spoon. Plus the cashiers are all grumpy, which makes me suspect management is problematic. If the tomato bean parmesan soup was tastier there may have been some redemption, but really the only great thing I've had in my various visits here was a cookie, so I think I will take one to go and eat elsewhere next time.
