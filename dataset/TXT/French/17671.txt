9ot8oInkYZTt6wkkGe__vQ Its that time of the year, summerlicious! Took my mama here for a lunch date cuz french apparently is her fav cuisine lol

Ive heard so much about this place and all the hype going around the internet so I thought i had to give it a try. We ordered different things just so we could try more variety on the summerlicious menu. 

Appetizer: 
The rolls were warm. But nothing extravagant. I was pretty shock they served margarine, not even butter.  
Soup - i really did not like it. Didnt even finish half of it. Almost felt like i was drinking baby puke (not kidding)
Terrine - it was ok. Didnt taste any of the foie gras

Entree:
Salmon - it was a bit over cooked. But overall good flavours except the polenta. Nice plating
Steak - nice plating, tender and juicy. Gravy and veggies were good

Dessert:
Creme bulee - thought i couldnt go wrong with this but the cake crumbs on the side was meh. Egg flav was strong. 
Chocolate cake - flourless cake, stiff, nutty. But not too sweet. It was okay

Honestly, i didnt know if its because i had higher expectation on this place, the food was pretty disappointing. The service was good tho, made reservations, got served right away as i walked in. There were many people at the waiting area. There was only one server for the entire room with mayb like 8 tables, but she managed ok. Not sure if i would give it another try... even if its summerlicious menu, it shouldnt be that far off from quality.
