nkHaix6KenApS8M-liZsCQ I tried several dishes with my friends. the number in [] is the star. Highest is 5.
Soupe:
Roasted red bell pepper soup: sweet, full-bodied, buttery(cream or cheese), savory [4].  
Wild mushroom soup: full-bodied, oily, greasy, strong.  Too much for me. [3.5]
Plat de résistance:
Filet of salmon: crispy fried, salty, good fish. [3.5]
Smoked Truffle-Infused Filet Mignon: can feel the truffle, but average taste. good decor. [3]
Smoked salmon sandwich: I believed the bread and bacon are too crispy and tough, with a thicker source. Should only include veggie and fish, with light source to emphasize salmon taste. [3]
Dessert:
Chocolate mousse tower: well design, which its chef learnt from Julia Child. Taste smooth, sweet, crispy chocolate tower crust and rich source. [5]
Gateau marjolaine: smooth, with iced mousse, combined with hazelnut, praline, and coffee flavor. [5]
