S5gtq6g6dIfyaFvyPYyzkg Located towards the eastern end of George Street, this beautiful building was originally commissioned by 'The Commercial Bank of Scotland' and was designed by architect David Rhind (1808-1883). I always assumed the grand facade with its gigantic Parthenon-like pillars and ornate pedimental (the triangular shaped structure above the pillars) was directly inspired by the classical Greek style of architecture but apparently it was inspired by William Henry Playfair's 'Surgeon's Hall' building, itself inspired by what's more specifically known as the Graeco-Roman style.
Construction started on the 4th of June 1844 when a wealthy Leith Merchant named James Wyatt had the honour of laying the first foundation stone.
In 1959 'The Commercial Bank of Scotland' and 'The National Bank of Scotland' amalgamated into what was known as 'The National Commercial Bank of Scotland'. The building operated as their head office for another ten years until 1969 when this bank was amalgamated with 'The Royal Bank of Scotland'. With its head office a short distance away in St. Andrew Square 'The Royal Bank of Scotland' decided to concentrate its administration and the building lost its designation as head office. Things were set to change again when 'The Royal Bank of Scotland' decided that keeping the building was no longer viable. In 1993 the building was sold to a company called 'Caledonian Heritable Ltd' which converted the bank into what you see today.
