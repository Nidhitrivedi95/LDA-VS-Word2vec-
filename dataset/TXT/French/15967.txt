6x3zxKZ9GAu1HGH3fDbYyA had a three course dinner with a few drinks. the lighting was perfect to create an evening of romance, it wasn't too dark nor too bright. candles on tables. you could just hear the kitchen in the background- a pleasant but not dominating noise. professional servers. a full house. i had lobster, it was perfect, wasn't overdone. you could see the other customers enjoying their meals as well. the plates were well presented but NOT overdone with artistic "flare" good portions as well.  a favourite in stouffville
