4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw A group of 4 of us was able to get a seat on the patio on a Saturday night for dinner in time to watch the fountain show and it was great! I only wish they could control the music playing outside their restaurant so we could hear the songs the waters were dancing to. The wild escargot is an exotic appetizer to try especially if you dip your bread into the sauce. So good you want to keep ordering more bread. 

The daily special was bison and the flavors or seasoning was delicious. Bison is usually very lean and tough but this one was tender to eat. Instead of fries it came with green beans which I appreciated since I had been lacking some greens on my vegas trip. 

Friends ordered the 22 oz bone ribeye and filet mignon with sides like garlic spinach, pommes pure (mash potatoes), and macaroni gratin (mac & cheese). We also paired it with a red wine that was a nice addition to our overall meal and dining experience.  

Service was great and we're glad the weather wasn't terrible to enjoy dining outside.
