4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Ate here 2 times during recent stay at Paris. It was nice to have a "home" pub that we could go to with good food. Its a little pricey but what do you expect in LV. Seating was bit tight, Maybe not squeeze so many in here. Had the Hanger Steak that was outstanding. This was big enough for 2 people. Could easily split this one. Breakfast was good. Eggs Benedict special was excellent, Ham and Cheese crepe nothing special but OK.
We would definitely come back and recommend. Try to get seating in glass area around the bar if you cannot get on the patio outside.
