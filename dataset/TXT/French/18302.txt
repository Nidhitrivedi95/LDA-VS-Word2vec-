A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g This place is soooo good. Sometimes I like the bread even better then the pastries.
Never had a bad meal here.
Fresh croissants every morning
Owners are really from France so if you speak French go on in
6 great soups and salads every day along with a fabulous onion soup
How to see you there soon to check out the bouch de Noel (Yule log)made especially for Xmas.
Located right behind the new Bonefish Grill restaurant
