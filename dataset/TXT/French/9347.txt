I was in Las Vegas for my birthday this year and was perusing Yelp to find the perfect restaurant near MGM that would not break mine or my friends' bank account but also that would have good food, service etc. Mon Ami met my criteria and thankfully Yelp allowed me to make reservations via the Yelp app on my iphone. 

I am so glad I made reservations, there was a lot of people waiting outside for dinner when we got there. We were given a table within 10 minutes of arriving in the inner dining hall which had a spectacular view of the Bellagio and it's water fountain show! Hooray for free grandiose entertainment on my birthday! 

Our waitress knew were crunched for time as we had a show to catch, so she made sure to bring out everything promptly. While we waited for our food we were given warm loaves of bread, butter, and this amazing carrot salad that you eat with the bread and butter. I'm not going to lie, we asked for more--I just won't tell you how many times we asked for more.

Our food was delicious. My party ordered scallops, steak, salmon, crab so I made sure to sample every single dish and they were all amazingly good. Simply a delight. The salmon melted in my mouth and was accompanied by a quinoa salad. The scallop plate had just the right amount of bacon and was served with greens. The steak came with fries! Two of my friends shared the sea food platter and devoured it. At the end of the meal Mon Ami brought out ice cream for my birthday and sang to me!

We left the restaurant feeling full and happy. I thought it was a great birthday dinner and I so glad my friends agreed.
