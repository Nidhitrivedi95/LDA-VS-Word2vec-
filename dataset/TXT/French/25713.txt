Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA We got the chance to have dinner here after our wedding. It. Was. AMAZING! The food was awesome! The view is indescribable. The atmosphere is excellent and the service was on point. They easily accommodated to our group of 10. We were one of the last tables to be seated that night (9:30 pm) but we did not feel rushed to finish our meal. We were so stuffed from our meal that we passed on dessert, but because we were still celebrating in our wedding attire they brought us out Profiteroles and they were to die for! They even included a special message written in the chocolate sauce. We will definitely be making an anniversary trip to visit this place!
