uP3H5bcsiTXM0k0xQhRndg We were skeptical about all the good reviews and actually tried to go to another restaurant before hitting on this one. (The other restaurant was full and wouldn't let us wait for a table.) So glad we came here!! They were SO nice! All of the staff was pleasant and acknowledged/talked to you - not just if you were "their table."  It's a small restaurant with a little upstairs.  We sat upstairs and it was cozy.  Has a sort of upscale diner feel.  We split the burrata pizza and the mac and cheese and some sort of bread pudding dessert. Can't remember what it was called but it's made with maple syrup.

Burrata Pizza: so yummy. Lots of cheese on it and perfect size for an appetizer for 2 people

Mac and Cheese: SO YUMMY!  The meat is a little sweet but they give you hot sauce to go with the dish and it really brings all the flavors together well.  Thought the description on the menu didn't do this dish justice because it says something about the mac and cheese being topped with ham but it's really more like a brined pulled pork that has some nice maple glazing on it.  Not like Christmas ham slices or something.  We probably wouldn't have ordered this if we hadn't gotten a more accurate description from other people's reviews.  

Dessert: heavenly

That's it.  A solid restaurant with a cute atmosphere, nice and attentive service and really good food.  What more could you ask for?
