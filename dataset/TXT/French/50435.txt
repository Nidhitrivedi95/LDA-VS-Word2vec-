ovtlrcsVRlgZZQUlHs_ovw On Easter Sunday my brother, sister and I decided to try this restaurant as we saw the good reviews and thought it would be good.  Well for Easter Sunday they had the option to order off of a planned menu (halibut, lamb, chicken) or you could order off their menu.  We opted for their planned menu thinking it would be quicker.  The food was ok I will say their carrot bisque soup was very good.  Now we ordered our food within 10 mins of being seated and it took an hour and a half for our food to arrive.  It was too long to wait and the food was not worth the wait.  I know I won't go back as I was not impressed with the food they served not to mention the long wait time.
