aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw For a breakfast restaurant located in the beautiful Las Vegas Venetian Hotel, I expected much, much better.  Although this particular day didn't seem to be a busy day for the hotel, we found Bouchon extremely busy. Hmm, that would normally indicate a top notch restaurant, eh?

Our wait?  It was about 45-50 minutes,,, so naturally I was expecting some really top notch food to be coming. In fact, I was really counting on having some gourmet waffles this particular morning! Well, would you believe it, this place actually ran out of waffles!!! How do you run out of waffles? Sure, perhaps a restaurant could run out of frozen Lego waffles, but I would expect THIS restaurant to be making their own fresh waffles- which you should NEVER run out of!  Unbelievable... it's just flour, eggs, sugar, milk... not much required!  I got no excuses, just "we're out".

Okaaaay... well, after I got over the fact they ran out of waffles, I ordered some really basic pouched eggs (which I expected to arrive in front of me tout de suite).  Nope, I was once again extremely disappointed!!!  Delivery of our basic food order was incredibly slow - making our whole experience at Bouchon a huge time waster during an otherwise beautiful morning.

Solution?  Well, for the rest of our stay at the Venetian we boycotted Bouchon and had some great fast and delicious breakfast meals at the Food Court... which is the place to go if you don't want the hassles you might be subjected to at Bouchon.  Perhaps the test is to ask how long your wait will be at Bouchon and then judge... good luck! :)
