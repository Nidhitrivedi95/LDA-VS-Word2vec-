hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA Holy cow! Unbelievably great food! Awesome little French cafe tucked into a small business park. Went there for lunch with one of my employees based on their recommendation. Amazing food! All fresh made, unique and special. Great sandwiches, great drinks, and pastries too. Try the coffeee...amazing. So yeah, kind of gushing about this place but really is a superb breakfast/lunch spot. Glad I work nearby!
