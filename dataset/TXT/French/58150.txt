rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Came here after checking out lake Havasu. Ordered foie Gras and crab and beets salad. The bread is so hard I felt like I broke my teeth. The foie Gras  is good and the Salad is okay. The best part of the meal is desserts. We had brownie with ice cream and creme brulee. Both excellent. I asked for coffee but the server forgot about it. I was disappointed on their bread and that the server forgot my coffee. I'll just go to their bakery next time.
