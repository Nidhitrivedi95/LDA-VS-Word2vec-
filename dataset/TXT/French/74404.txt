xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g My wife and I went here for our anniversary in December and we were very pleased with the food and service. I made a reservation early and had asked for a table with a view and they fulfilled that request. They even brought out a little appetizer/dessert because they knew it was a special occasion.

I ordered roast chicken, my wife ordered the duck. My chicken was great, and according to my wife she thought her duck was great also. It is a little pricey but considering the cost of other restaurants like this i believe its comparable. Our bill was less than 100 for two entrees, two desserts and drinks.

The view is why you go here, it was great the Bellagio water show was going on at the time it made for a very fun experience overlooking the strip.
