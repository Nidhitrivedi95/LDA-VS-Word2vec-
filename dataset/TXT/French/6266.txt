4cWrtMvfj-tomyEPgP7KFg If liking Melting Pot is wrong, I don't want to be right. 

Listen, I know Melting Pot is a chain and it's pricey...waahhhh wahhh. Guess what? I love melty cheese. I love melty chocolate. I don't *mind* throwing a few veggies into a crockpot of chicken broth and hanging out for a little while. Plus, they have a decent drink list and great variety of offerings & meal combinations. 

The service at this particular Melting Pot is typically solid and they are great at handling substitutions. Don't like broccoli? They'll sub out for another veggie. Scallops get you down? Sub in some bird. Oh, and I haven't mentioned it yet, but the Green Goddess cream cheese/sour cream/herby sauce for the veggies is so good I want to marry it.

Whether you want just a cheese fondue or you're going full on three course, Melting Pot is solid & delicious.
