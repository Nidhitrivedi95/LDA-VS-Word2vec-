cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg In its category the food at PDC is not worthy of a higher rating than one star. 

I almost did not get in this past weekend since my reservation was somehow lost despite a voicemail confirming it. Service did their best but was slow. PDC was out of two wines that were on the menu. I don't know if I just had bad luck with the two I wanted, but, I can only guess they were out of other bottles as well. They were also out of the foie gras dish I asked for. 

At the recommendation of the server I ordered the Plogue à Champlain. This dish has a lot of potential but was not executed correctly. The dish was seared foie gras on top of English style bacon, potatoes and a crepe with the entier dish soaked in maple syrup. One of the components was cold and the foie gras was charred on the outside and close to rare on the inside. 

The only good dish of the night was the Tomato Tartlet that had a very good pastry crust. 

The proteins in the PDC's Melting Pot were not seasoned at all. The mash was good and I had to use it to get any flavor on the proteins. 

The special rib eye steak, recommend by the server over Shepherd's Pie was decent but nothing I could not prepare at home with a quality product. 

The worst dish of the night was the special desert. The summer pudding consisted of a 'cooked' shortbread with 'fresh' summer beers. The shortbread was under temperature and the berries had to have come packaged in syrup. 

A side of fries that was ordered with everything else never came. 

The one star is on the food alone. Based on all the hype and reviews here I don't know what to make of my one experience here. Was it an off night? In any event my meal was simply not good.
