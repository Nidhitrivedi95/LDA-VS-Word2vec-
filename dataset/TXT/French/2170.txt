0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g Great food presentation and very good food but egregiously overpriced and not all that satisfying, especially since the menu is limited and leaves you feeling hungry.  The restaurant itself is very nice and wait staff very attentive but there are better restaurant options at the Bellagio including Prime and Le Cirque which will give you the same lagoon view that Picasso offers.  Still it appeals to foodies and people looking to simply say they've eaten here.  Worth a try once or twice but should not be a regular stop for people, there's better choices at Bellagio and throughout Las Vegas.
