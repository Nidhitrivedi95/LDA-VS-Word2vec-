COuznKd_gb_N8hlOy3_i9w We had a truly enjoyable dinner celebrating our anniversary at Zinc, a new French bistro in downtown Cleveland.  The rooms are reminiscent of a true French bistro with upstairs tables offering a great view of the bar as well as a bit of privacy.  The outdoor patio is gorgeous and inviting.  The cocktail list is interesting, and although I usually order wine, I ventured out at the affable waiter's suggestion and was not disappointed.  As a vegan, I was a bit concerned when I did not see anything in the entrees that did not contain animal protein of some kind, but when I asked the waiter, he whisked away to the kitchen and reported that the chef would be "delighted" to do the wild mushroom risotto vegan...chefs are NOT usually delighted, so I took this as a good sign.  The house salad was fresh and perfectly dressed, and garnished with an olive tapenade crouton.  My husband's selections from the raw bar were perfect!  His short rib ravioli were delicious, and he scooped up the savory sauce with some of their delicious home-baked French bread (which, by the way, is served with a garlicky white bean puree...vegan and yummy!)  My risotto was perfectly cooked al dente, and the surrounding pureed cauliflower sauce was magnificent.  My husband's cassoulet (special on Tuesdays) was perfect with shredded duck confit, sausages and salt pork and melt-in-your mouth white beans.  The portions were generous, so we were not able to sample dessert, but the selections looked great...maybe next time!  There will definitely be a next time!  By then the retail bakery will be open, and from the looks of their espresso machine, it will make a delightful spot for dessert and coffee after a show.  For a brand new establishment in a newly renovated space, this place has tremendous potential.  Free valet parking is also a plus.
