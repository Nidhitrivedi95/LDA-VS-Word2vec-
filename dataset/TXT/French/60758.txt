SCklYa_jhihWAcfIn-_chg I can't give it a 5 since the oven was broken that day. This is a small place so be prepare to wait for a table even for just a party of 2 on a weekday. We ordered a spicy bacon baguette and a French toast. I have to agree with the other reviews. They have the best baguette I've ever had.
