They have large sized macarons for 3.25/ea. I purchased vanilla, raspberry and chocolate. Vanilla was more of a vanilla bean super light, chewy, fluffy and just delicious! Raspberry was ok, it wasn't as good as the vanilla, the coloring on the cookie was half faded so I don't know if it was the light in the case that caused it, or it was a little less than fresh. I probably should have stuck with the coffee flavored one. 
Chocolate was fabulous, rich flavor, melt in your mouth macaroon cookie goodness. 

I also purchased a blueberry muffin around $4. It Had a crumb topping with powdered sugar. Muffin tasted like a muffin, not too dense or cakey. Lots of luscious blueberries inside, definitely not lacking. 
I waited to indulge on these goodies until my last day in Vegas. I anticipated them to be delicious, and they were.  So they were a nice end to my vacation. 
My next trip here, I'll definitely be  trying more
