But not to complain about the food because it was not bad. I had the escargots to start which were so garlicky they were almost spicy. Delicious but not served with anything to sop up the lovely juices and break up the strong flavour, but I asked for more of the bread we had to start and the waitress brought some. I had the shrimp and scallop curry which was quite nice and my friend had the beef bourgignon. Only problem is that my friend does not eat pork and there was almost as much bacon as there was beef in her stew. For dessert, she had a raspberry sorbet which was great and I had the lemon tart. Large portion but I personally wasn't a fan of the crust and thought it should have been more lemony.
Overall, it was a nice experience to try a new place but it won't go on my regular rotation.
