udFcIcbWbxrO8uLF95WnQg Went on double date there for Valentines Day.  The restaurant was packed and very loud, but all the food was amazing.  Service was what one would expect on a very busy night.

Appetizer: Escargot, in a garlic butter sauce with bread crumbs, enough to split with 4 people.

Entreé: Atlantic Cod, served with a great blanc sauce and spinach.

Dessert: Hazelnut Cheesecake with orange sauce, I don't know why it was good but it was.
