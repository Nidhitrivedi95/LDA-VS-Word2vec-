7Ug8zCmY6iDTewxWqeYQ2g I LOVED this place, and am SO glad it was recommended to me by my host. This is French cuisine of fine quality, at a price that makes food like this otherwise inaccessible to many people. For only $12 on top of the entree price, you are treated to an appetizer and dessert. The decor is clean and modern, with an open kitchen that is fun to peak into. The service is highly trained. If the French is daunting for you, worry not, your waiter will very patiently describe to you everything that is being served that day. In terms of the appetizers, we loved everything! The salad was perfectly tossed and well balanced, the leek soup was refreshing. The short rib was absolutely delicious, the veal was melt in your mouth, fish was perfectly flakey, rabbit was seasoned perfectly (the only bad thing I can say about the entrees was the rabbit was a tad dry). The desserts were not as consistently wonderful -- while the chocolate mousse was absolutely divine, once you compared it to anything else, everything else was mildly disappointing. 

Make reservations as soon as you can, they are often fully seated at least a few days in advance. Another great perk -- BYOB! They will bring out an ice bucket to chill your white and rose, and serve anything you bring to them with finesse.
