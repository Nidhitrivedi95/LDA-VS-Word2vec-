As for the menu, the steak frites is a decent order for lunch.  If you are getting a bit tired of never ending partying, I would definitely suggest it for a more subdued yet still casual experience.  It's not a high-end restaurant, but Vegas needs some of those as well.

For individuals in DC, they have apparently opened up a location in Bethesda, MD which is quite accessible through the metro...
