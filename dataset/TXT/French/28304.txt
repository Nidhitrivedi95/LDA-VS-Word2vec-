eDtBCZDo92LqBCIfE45hhg We were expecting to find great food in Montreal, and this place met every expectation.  The cellar atmosphere was comfortable and fun, the service was friendly and attentive, and the food was fabulous.  Among us, we had deer, cod, sausage, mushroom ravioli, smoked trout, goat cheesecake, and rhubarb sorbet, and it was all imaginatively wonderful.  The wine pairings were excellent, too.  Given the quality of the dinner, it was a huge value, as well. We ordered drinks, appetizers, wine and dessert for three and barely broke $200.
