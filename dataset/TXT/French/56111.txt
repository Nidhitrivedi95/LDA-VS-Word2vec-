rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A First off, this place is located inside the Venitian.  Decor was nice and clean like your typical French joint.  I was curious and asked our waitress about celebrities dining here and says from time to time they do get some.

So we were here for brunch and I ordered the moules frites, perfectly made with white wine and herb spice with side of crunchy fries.  I dipped the warm house bread into the left-over juice! mmmm!

Spicey donut was good, came with side of special fruity jam.  Great coffee!  I tried some of my friends Chicken and Waffles and it was out of this world.  Waffles were light and fluffy! Chicken was tender and seasoned appropriately! Nice balance!

Would definitely return!
