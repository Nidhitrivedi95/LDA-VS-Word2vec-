jaSowNITPRRCYpPb3_pjdA Went to Andre's for lunch on Sunday, saw it here on yelp and it was an excellent decision. We sat at the bar, the service was really great. We got some good recommendations from the bartender for food and some beer. We had the escargot, really flavorful tons of garlic and butter - comes with 6. The French onion soup was also delicious, the broth tasted homemade and had a lot of cheese but it wasn't greasy. For mains the sausage trio was really good especially the lamb if thats your style. The croque madame was simple but really awesome, the bread was perfect. It came with some super crispy duck fat fries. Overall the food here was excellent and so was the service. Will definitely be getting a craving for their french onion soup sometime in the near future.
