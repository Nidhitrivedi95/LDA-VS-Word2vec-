jA3xcba82t8x06H8NzG4VQ We finally made it to the new location last night and it was fabulous! The atmosphere is very similar to the previous location which made me happy. 

We started with the amazing charcuterie platter which we can't pass up when Chef Nowak is involved. Nobody does it better. Everything on it was delicious but the standout was the chicken liver pate surrounded by butter. Genius...reminded me of Paris. 

Next was the blue marlin crudo for me and the chicken livers for my husband. The crudo was so fresh and flavorful.  The chicken livers were corned then fried which made for the best chicken livers ever. Yes, I'm saying that and I don't typically eat them. 

Our main courses were the pasta bolognese and the Berkshire pork. Both were to die for. The drinks are also fabulous. If you haven't tried this place, you need to. 

Nice job Chef! And thanks Branda...you are always fab.
