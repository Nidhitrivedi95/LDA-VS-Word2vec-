4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw The Las Vegas version of a Chicago classic.  It's one of our Vegas favorites for several reasons.  Well located in the Paris, great view of the Bellagio fountains and a well priced menu.  Lately, we've been stopping in for lunch.  I LOVE the chicken sandwich with brie, apples and carmelized onions.  Great place to have a glass of champagne, relax and take in the people watching.
