rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Not that need too add more too the thousands of reviews on Bouchon. You can never have enough reviews in life. I came here for Brunch with my dad, brother, and sister-in-law. It was the first time for me and my dad. I always wanted too checkout  Bouchon just rarely go high end restaurants much anymore. Special occasion whenever have full family together. This was definitely one of those occasions. Talk about packed for brunch or breakfast/lunch. Still not that bad of wait twenty mins at most.

We started by sharing Bouchon Pastry Basket. You get too select four different ones or any combination your heart desires. We asked if you could order from the pastry special board for the day. Can do! On this day good thing since half of the pastry list too choose from was out. The ones that we did have was fabulous!! We had regular croissant, almond chocolate croissant, apple cheese danish, and scone. Every one literally tasted fresh out of the oven. The croissants talk about buttery, flaky, moist, and really felt like tasty of Paris in your mouth. Just great way too start off the day fresh pastry and coffee. 

I ordered the Croque Madame. Talk about ham and cheese. The fact using fresh brioche bread added so much more depth then regular bread. Sliced Ham not skimpy at all or the quality of Ham and cheese. More cheese on top with some kind of white cheese sauce. Then ultimate finish sunny side up egg on top. Heavy breakfast packed with all the bad things start the day but SOOO good. Side skinny cut french fries. Too say side more like mound of fries. I was surprised for fancy Thomas Keller restaurant the portion sides be so reasonable.
