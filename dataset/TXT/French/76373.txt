The duck hash and eggs was SO good. I don't like runny eggs so I was thrilled to find a hash that was intended to be served with scrambled eggs. The duck was tender and well-seasoned and the puff pastry that the hash sat on was a pleasant surprise. We ordered the banana-sour cream pancakes for the table to share, which were also tasty but not as memorable as the duck hash. If you're in the mood for a boozy brunch, get the nirvana sour (vodka, elderflower liquer, strawberries and fresh squeezed grapefruit juice) - it wasn't overrun with sweetness or the taste of alcohol.
