XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q What to say that hasn't already been said?  Well, this was my husband and my first really expensive fine dining experience.  We knew that we wanted the 16-course degustation, but knew we'd pay a hefty price, about half the cost of our entire mini-vacation!  So we knew it wasn't worth it.

Well, it was COMPLETELY worth it!  I do believe that dining like this is not for everyone (and I was a bit disgusted with some people wearing faded jeans to dinner - I mean seriously??), but if you like fine dining it is a must.

Out of the 16-course degustation, our favorites were the asparagus caviar, maki roll caviar, scallop, lobster, sea urchin, chicken, and soybean risotto - all of these were over the top amazing!  And this was coming from people who thought they didn't/wouldn't like caviar, sea urchin, and foie gras!  That being said, the rest of the courses were excellent too - not every one was something that I would order myself, but every dish was a surprise of tastes, a feast of the senses.

Of course, the service was spectacular as well.  The limo was right on time to pick us up at TI and an excellent addition to the experience.  The waitstaff did the best job I had ever seen and will be unlikely to be beaten in the near future.

Honestly, I only have positive things to say about this meal.  We will definitely be back, though it could be a few years (as it is very expensive!).  That being said, this is perhaps a once-in-a-lifetime experience, worth every penny, and I'll definitely be craving this food for YEARS.
