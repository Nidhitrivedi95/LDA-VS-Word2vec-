gjCmXkMNVE0JSk8puUwv6g This is my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas...by far!!! It's a true hidden gem that you must discover for yourself! Definitely worth the short drive from the strip if you're visiting, and a must if you're a local. We got hooked on our first visit and kept going back. You can eat your way through the entire menu and love every single dish. From appetizers to entrees and desserts, their food is Michelin star-worthy without the Michelin star prices :) Every dish tells a story and you'll want to come back for more. Oh, and did I mention their specials!? They'll have at least one special waiting for you to try every day. It also doesn't hurt that the staff is super nice and friendly. Nicolas is a sweetheart! We'll keep Eatt-ing :D for sure!
