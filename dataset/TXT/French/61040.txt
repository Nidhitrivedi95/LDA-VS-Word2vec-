SFnrHuVFSNiondFVUBLJZQ I'm guessing Chez Suzette is pretty much just for the tourists based on the area it's in but if I lived in Montreal I think I'd brave the tourists to frequent this place.  It has a warm and cozy atmosphere, vegetarian options and reasonable prices for the portions and taste. 

I opted for the L'Argenteuil crepe, asparagus, bechamel sauce, and pine nuts in a crepe, then there's cheese on top and it's baked. OH MY GOOD GOD it was heaven wrapped in cream sauce and baked with cheese.  I asked to add mushrooms to the crepe and they came on the side.  At first I thought, that's weird, but it was nice to have a mushroom with every bite.   

My husband opted for the Crepe aux Avocats, which boasted pesto, avocados, and tomatoes. He added swiss cheese, which was also baked on top.  It was a refreshing and yummy crepe but nothing compared to the fatty, rich, creamy crepe that I ordered.  He was jealous.  My reasoning for 4 of 5 stars instead of a full 5 is that the asparagus was just slightly tough.   

A senior tour sat next to us and cracked me up with their Seinfeld's parentsesque comments.  They also seemed pretty happy with their meals.  If old people like it it must be good right?
