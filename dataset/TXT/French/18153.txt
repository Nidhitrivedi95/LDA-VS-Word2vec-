A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g I came for the macarons and they have a variety of flavors (on my visit, I counted almost 20 flavors to choose from). Each one at an affordable price of $1.25. I bought 15 for $18.75, and they're definitely worth it. I tried the chocolate mint, then mango, then pistachio back-to-back. Each one was pronounced and it was fun to change the flavors in my mouth. Super like!

My friend got a slice of the chocolate truffle cake and the coconut flan, both served in generous sizes. We shared it with 2 other friends and still had leftovers. The cake was moist, chocolatey, and not overbearing. Thumbs up. The coconut flan was filled with coconut meat shreds and had a pie crust. It was a different style of flan that I'm familiar with but it was enjoyable. Another win.

The service was awesome, the lady behind the counter was nice, patient, and knowledgeable.  I was so focused on the bakery portion of the place that I didn't venture on to the savory side, but will definitely be back, I can't stop thinking about this place. Thanks Patisserie Manon for the great experience.
