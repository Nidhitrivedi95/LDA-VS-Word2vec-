xaqW4NkmUCGRRjmLxiFJ6Q I found this place on Yelp and WOW the 5 star reviews couldn't be more right. I don't think I could say enough good things about this place. The food- excellent!!! The sugar cane drink- amazing and so fresh. The owner- so friendly, knowledgable and obviously passionate about what he does. They make everything right in front of you and it's such a cool atmosphere. It's clear they really focus on the details and it pays off. Try this place now. You will not be disappointed!!
