Kut9tVbDX_f7qKMRRoXg3w Came here w friends spur of the moment. French onion soup was delish and I got the smoked meat on a French baguette which was yummy! The service is a little "slow" but I'm a jersey guy and have little patience.  However their place was very well decorated and felt like welcoming. Highly recommended.
