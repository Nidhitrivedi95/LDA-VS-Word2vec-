ufwkkMd9yr9cFU1R5ONArg What an awesome little breakfast place! It was great to try something different for breakfast rather then having the traditional pancake eggs bacon.. etc. Here at huevos gourmet they bring a Mexican twist to your breakfast and it's amazing! Eggs, chorizo, salsa, torillas and jalapeño definitely gave a kick to start my day. I'll definitely be coming back!
It's a small place on lakeshore so you might want to plan ahead and expect a bit of a wait before going. You'll have to pay for parking as well. They do take names down and will call when your table is ready.
