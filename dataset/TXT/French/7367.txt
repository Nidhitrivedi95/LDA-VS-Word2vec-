4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Last night in Vegas and our friends and I weren't too hungry.  I've read about this place and wanted to try it and since we were walking by on our way to Caesars, we decided to eat here.  Was planning on just getting the french onion soup since it was a little cold outside and I love french onion soup.  We requested a table for 5 outside since it was nice and we could watch the Bellagio fountains while we hung out.  

The mini baguette that they brought out to eat while we wait for our food was pretty good.  Crusty and chewy, just like I like it.  Like I said, I was planning on the french onion soup but when I heard that one of the specials was bouillabaisse, that's what I wanted.  I like seafood.  It was cold outside.  Perfect.  Soup was very flavorful and fresh.  The mussels and clams were tender and sweet.  The fish was perfect.  Not mushy but just firm enough.  And last but not least were the scallops.  Nice, big and sweet.  Not tough but tender.  And to top it off, some really crusty bread slices to sop up the liquids.  Trust me, you want to get all of it.  

I also shared the chicken liver mousse with my buddy.  That was delicious.  Put that on the toasted points and it was a homerun.  Put a little of their mustard on it and it's a whole different experience but still a winner.  

The service was solid.  The atmosphere was fun and not boring or stuffy.  I would definitely eat here again next time I'm in Vegas.
