htQgj-ANQpZGpIpkkrEmyQ The hubby and I came here for date night as we saw so many rave reviews. 

We ordered to start: 
1) Pulled pork frites - The fries weren't particularly crispy and it didn't look like there was a lot of pulled pork.  The pork had good flavour overall but it wasn't astounding.  

2) Panko scotch egg - This dish was interesting.  To be honest, the taste and textures are difficult to describe.  I can't say it was bad nor can I say I loved it (and I'm a big fan of eggs).  

For entrees we had: 
1) Chicken and waffles - We didn't quite understand the point of the meringue kisses and left those uneaten.  We appreciated how the chicken was boneless and dark meat.  It was seasoned with 5 spice which added that "Asian" flavour to it.  The waffles were dense and lacklustre. 

2) Banana leaf salmon - The salmon was cooked well (not dry) and came with coconut rice.  I think perhaps the rice was cooked with coconut oil because it was quite oily.  In fact by the time you got to the end of the dish there was a pool of oil. 

The service was fantastic.  There was only one server who was friendly and came by often to refill our glasses with water. 

Overall, the food at Inspire was good but not great.  Not sure if I would come back.  It's certainly an Asian fusion restaurant and had very interesting combinations.  I wouldn't say I loved it but it was decent for the price.
