xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g We celebrated an anniversary dinner here, and had a table with a perfect fountain view. The bread is to die for and consistent with authentic French bread straight from the oven, and the beef Wellington was so tender I cut it with a fork! The putter pastry was flakey and light with the right balance of crunch on the crust and soft fluffy pastry near the meat center. I am picky on steaks and do not like when they are over cooked, and this was spot on perfect as far as how it was cooked. My only reason for not rating this a five is the wait even with reservations- when there were empty tables comparable to ours. It seemed odd that several couples and groups were left to wait even though there was clearly seating available.
