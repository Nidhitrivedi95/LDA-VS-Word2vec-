HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw Came here for a quick brunch before heading to the airport.  The restaurant was empty, you can tell this place is more of a dinner place.  The brunch menu your usual with some interesting options.  The cinnamon bun with duck sounded delish to me, so I ordered it.  Came in a flat board, the cinnamon buns was on one end with duck rolled into it, sweet and savory it was good the cream cheese was maybe a tad too sweet and also came with a side of back bacon this was a nice touch.  Overall it was a good experience.
