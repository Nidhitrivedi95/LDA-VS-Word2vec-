d482l58ho0_IMdFkXX1F5Q This is the first time that I felt compelled to write a review. This is probably the worst dining experience that I've ever had. My boyfriend and I ordered the prix fix menu ($79 a person) and were incredibly disappointed. The hamachi had good flavor but some of the vegetable elements were undercooked. The lobster risotto was inedible. The arborio rice was not fully cooked and way too salty. We sent it back hoping it was a bad batch but when they brought it back, the rice was still raw and uncooked in the center. The bouillabaisse stock tasted old and like it came out of a can. I've never had to send a dish back at a restaurant so that should tell you how bad the lobster risotto was. The manager also refused to take the lobster risotto off our bill even though we only had a bite. Most disappointing $200 I've ever spent.
