We made reservations for Mon Ami Gabi for our bachelorette party of 11 this weekend.  Unfortunately, we were running late so had to change our reservation from 6 to 6:45.  When we arrived, the line was quite long, so it took about 10 minutes to get to the hostess desk.  As soon as we got to the front, however, they took us right back to our table.  The dining room is a bit crowded, but beautiful.  The ambiance is still romantic.

As we perused the menu, our waitress (Shana) noticed that we were a little rushed.  Our limo was scheduled to pick us up for the next event at 8PM (it was 7:15 by this time).  She took our orders and said she would have the kitchen rush so that we could be out in time.  We were absolutely amazed when we got our food a few minutes later.  There was quite a bit of diversity in the orders - steak, chicken, pasta, etc. and everything was cooked perfectly still.  Every girl raved about their dish, and the quality.  Special thank you to the kitchen staff.  Shana and her assistants kept our drinks full and went above and beyond to make sure that we had a wonderful experience, even though rushed.  She was able to split our checks 9 ways and we made it in time to meet our driver outside at 8PM.  

The french bread was served in a cute paper bag, with butter, and this flavorful carrot garnish.  I opted for the chicken grand-mere which came with pommes puree.  Again, cooked perfectly with the perfect complement of flavors and spices.  Usually, a French restaurant is not my first choice when dining in Vegas, but I'm sure I will be back to sit and enjoy the complete meal and experience.
