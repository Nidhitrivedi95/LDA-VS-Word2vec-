GS06uO84yKQpa7oezgVZgQ 6 of us ate here on Saturday night (21/2/09) to celebrate my birthday and we all had a really wonderful meal. A wide selection of food for each course, all of which was cooked to perfection. The CSH team work hard and it is reflected in the smooth running of the restaurant. Go along and experience it for yourself I'll certainly go back.
