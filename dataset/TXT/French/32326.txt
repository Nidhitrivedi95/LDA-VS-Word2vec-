gxMa7j1LXIUxxBoP0osDpA We spent 10 days traveling (and eating) throughout Quebec and this restaurant was our favorite. All aspects (service, food, atmosphere) of this restaurant should receive 5 stars (save wine service since this is a BYOB). The servers were so friendly and informative.  They were also very passionate about the food being served; knowing it and describing it perfectly. A friendly welcome often sets the tone for the whole experience and these folks win here. The atmosphere is energetic bistro with enough sound dampening to allow for a pleasant personal conversation. The food was to die for: exploding with the primary flavor of the dish yet complimented by herbs and spices. I had the sweetbreads as an appetizer. These were served with a light, slightly sweet sauce of fruit and maple and topped with coarsely prepared herbs that was so light yet exploded with flavored and textures. We also had a brilliant Halibut with black garlic and mango that was perfect for a warm summer night and delicately prepared. We trusted the chef so much we had creme brûlée and a trio of sorbets for dessert - things we would NEVER order in lesser hands -and they did not disappoint. The creme brûlée was rich and delicious and the brittle crust perfectly executed. My sorbets were anything but the usual; they expressed their flavored to a T: pear, fennel and blueberry. In addition there was an amuse bouche of gazpacho and an interlude of lime sherbet in vodka all part of a perfectly paced (2+ hour) meal. Add the fact that you can bring and have a wine you couldn't afford from most restaurant wine lists and you have an exceptional night out. This place is a must.
