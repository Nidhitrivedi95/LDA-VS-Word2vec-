hvjgF-vnPw2jyL5DBuB0qg Came here for dinner on a cold winter night by myself.  Thankful I was by myself because I would have found it hard to carry a conversation with the music that loud.  However, that being said, enjoyed the music.  Had the beet salad and oxtail ragout for dinner.  Both dishes were very well done.  Perhaps it was just me or the night but it felt like each dish was missing that element that would have taken it to excellent.  What was it I wanted in the beet salad - another flavor dimension perhaps?  The oxtail was good but feel like I was missing some top note that would have taken it further.  Okay som I'm splitting hairs here.  It was a really good meal and I was fully satisfied.  but perhaps not the most unforgettable meal of the past year.
