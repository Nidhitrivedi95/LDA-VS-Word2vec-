rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I've been to Bouchon Napa Valley and now twice to Bouchon Las Vegas. I absolutely love this restaurant. There are so many options you just can't go wrong. The escargot is never a bad idea here and the steak tartare is a must try. I absolutely love these items and if you've never had them but have always wanted to try - this is this place to do it. So yummy! We were also treated to a tour of the kitchens. It was amazing. The kitchens here are so clean and it is absolutely the coolest thing ever!! Definitely check Bouchon out if in Vegas
