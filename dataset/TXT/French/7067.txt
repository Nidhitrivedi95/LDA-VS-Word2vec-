The best thing about the meal was the bread and what seemed to be freshly made butter (which is still served cold).

We should've gone to a Ramsay restaurant.

Our server was great, but the seating situation sucked. I had an awesome view of stripper-mobiles with a side of car exhaust to go with my meal. Giant tits on a billboard and some fumes mixed in with my salmon. Unfortunately, the lighting inside was poor, and it seemed all servers were outside anyway.

Red Lobster probably serves better seafood than this place, and at half the cost.
Honestly, I was severely underwhelmed.

The sour cream ice cream was delicious, but didn't make up for the lackluster meal.
