xsFJZu4nME615byZVrpMGA This is a place to visit ONCE if you haven't been to a Nespresso before. Grand decor, even grandeur (read expensive) coffee makers at the back of store. Coffee is very average, some are rather tasteless. But what bothers me MOST is the service--pompous service!!! I have been there twice. The first time I came across a rude staff and though it was my bad luck and wrote it off. The second time I am almost convinced that it's the culture in the store. The body language when they are serving you. My goodness! These people think because they work at Yorkville give them to behave that way!!! I almost wanted to go all American and yelled at her at her face!
