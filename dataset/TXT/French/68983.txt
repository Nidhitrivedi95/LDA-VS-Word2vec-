VwZhwflLnTq19aAeFLJHCQ Let's start with warm, friendly service when we walked in the door.  Very refreshing.   Nice decor, comfortable seating.   And you can tell it's fresh.  I had a salad that jumped off the plate with beauty and taste.  Don't miss the beet vinaigrette - sounds strange, tastes amazing.  The quiche Florentino melted in my mouth.  Will be back for sure.
