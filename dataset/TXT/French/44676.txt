mnn--vaYHtNyBNYFYBFIog My fiancé and I had dinner here last night to celebrate his birthday.  We came in with the same expectations as with any fine dining restaurant we go to.....we want to have solid food and good service.  

The service was superb!  We were originally seated by the open concept wine cellar.  Nice view, but the foot traffic was so distracting that we asked to be reseated.  The maître d' accommodated our request as soon as he found an empty table.  The staff were knowledgeable about the food, always available when needed, but were not overly intrusive.  Their service is the best I've had in a long time.  

Now the food.  We chose the 7 course tasting menu.  As the waiter said...it's like a journey.  Well, we were started off with an amuse bouche of gravlax wrapped around a pretzel stick and creme fraiche.  Nothing new here...it was an unimaginative serving with lackluster taste.  The whole thing was at room temperature, including the creme fraiche.

Next our scallops in a half shell.  Again, nothing new.  The scallops were done correctly, but served at room temperature.  In fact, temperature was an issue for us all through the night, with food being served either at room temperature or just mildly warm.  

And so we just sat there through the death march of beautifully plated food but wrong serving temperature, unimaginative flavors or confused plates.  The cheese course was covered with potato sticks.  Seriously?!  It was this plated mess of salt on salt.  Not to mention that the texture was raspy against the palate.  

The saving grace of the night was the duck magret with duck heart.  The duck heart was done correctly and was delicious!  The breast was sinewy, skin lost it's crispiness, but it was still ok.  

Overall, there were two bright spots in a dinner that lasted almost 3 hours.  Impeccable service and good duck!  Two stars for Toqué!
