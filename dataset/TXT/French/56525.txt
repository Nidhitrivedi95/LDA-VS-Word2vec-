rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I have been to all four Bouchon and I was extremely disappointed when I came to this one. Even thought I had gonne last year, and it was very good, this time, it was not so good.

The service was not there, the goodness of the food was not there, maybe the Chef was off that day because nothing was right.

My food came out cold, I didn't complain, because my boyfriend asked me not to, so I ate it, and enjoyed it. 

It was not bad, it was good, but not like, wow, it was good.  

I had the croque madame, a dish that I've had at Bouchon in Yountville. the morney sauce was bland, the sandwich was cold and so where my fries. I waited a long time for it too, then I had a salad that I've had in Yountville and in Beverly Hills, and this one was wilted, and not good. 

Maybe it was a bad day, I don't know, but I will give it one more try in Las Vegas, I still believe in Thomas Keller and will not give up on him.
