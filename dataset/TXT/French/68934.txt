VwZhwflLnTq19aAeFLJHCQ The food was alright.  Nothing special.  The service, however, was the worst I've ever had.  The hostess was nice, but the waiters and waitresses were the most unprofessional people ever.  We got fried calamari for appetizer and it literally got 5 pieces of calamari and the rest was fried onions.  The waiter used a lighter to check our ID's.  We ordered a bottle of wine and when we're done with the wine the waitress kept pushing us to get more alcohol and was rude when we said no.  The waitress dropped the silverware when she replaced it for us and yelled "shit".  Hey lady, we can hear you.  And she examined the receipts to see how much tip we gave her right in front of us while we're still at the table.  How rude can a person be.  Let's just say this is our first and will be last time here.  I have to give a star because I had to in order to write a review.
