WOd8tWsh2Yt_osHv-ngx_w This is one of the best breakfast spots I've eaten in Montreal. Menu was vast and they even have a kids menu. Prices aren't bad considering the portions. Atmosphere is cool especially with the patio door open during the summer time. I had the universel breakfast with crepes and it was yummy including the beans! Kids loved their meals as well. Service wasn't bad considering how busy they were. I would definitely come back here.
