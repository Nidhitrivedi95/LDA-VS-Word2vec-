4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw My fiance got the steak with mashed potato, while I got salmon with green peas. We also got the leek soup to share. The food was fantastic and tasty, but the female waitress waiting on our table did not give us much recognition. I'm glad that my fiance made reservations to this place. They gave us a loaf of warm bread upon entering. The leek soup was very rich, and tasted like clam chowder. I really enjoyed all the food. Having said that, I would be back, but there are so many places to try in BBAEGAS
