AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw I have only had the flourless chocolate chocolate chip cookie and man was that cookie worth the couple bucks.  I am a big fan of Diddy Riese but I gotta say, this place takes the cookie trophy...if we are simply talking about taste and quality (Diddy Riese is still my favorite when it comes to accessibility and quantity haha).
