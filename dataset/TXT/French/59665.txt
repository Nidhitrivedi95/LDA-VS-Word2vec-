They have signature Caesar Salad that is delicious and big enough to share. They have several specialty nights like wine tasting and special course meals and they have special desserts with certain meals. I LOVE this place, loved it when it was Bernard's Bistro and LOVE it now! Seafood Wellington is amazing!
