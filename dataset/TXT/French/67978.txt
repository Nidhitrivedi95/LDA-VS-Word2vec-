v50-nvBCZNf7nCNbyUlQLw We went here on Saturday morning.  To explain our devotion to this place, I should say that we drove down from Butler in order to get our crepes fix before our friend's early afternoon wedding.  You see, we used to go here every Friday after our first (and last) class of the day in college.  It was/is a mild obsession- a love affair of sorts.

When we got here just before 10:00, we saw that it wasn't open yet.  It was slightly odd that we stood outside until 10:15 before they opened the door.  I think that instead of making customers wait, they should just open the restaurant later, but whatever.

We walked downstairs and got in line at the register.  I was so happy to see that nothing had changed- I ordered the mixed veggie crepe with soytang sauce, and a nonfat cafe au lait.  They only accept cash, so come prepared.  I paid, took our number, and sat down.  The space is really small, so it does fill up, but it's perfectly cozy.  Our crepes were as good as ever, and including my coffee drink, my bill came in at just over $10.00.

The owner is very friendly, and normally behind the crepe maker.  This is a great place to have brunch or dessert- they also have sweet crepes (Nutella and banana is my favorite)- so be sure to check it out. It's right off of Walnut Street, so you can easily stop in before or after an afternoon of shopping.
