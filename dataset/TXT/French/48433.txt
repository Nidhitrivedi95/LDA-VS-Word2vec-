OdjINFB2qGR57eWw2nwCsQ We dined at Jellyfish for a friend's birthday and our overall experience was great. 

The decor is amazing and although it was a busy night for the restaurant, the logistics were great. We were quickly seated and service overall was good. 

I ordered the beef tataki and the burrata as appetizers, followed by the filet mignon. Although the kitchen initially sent out my steak cooked to the wrong temperature, our waitress promptly and expectedly took it back for a fresh one. The unexpected part was that the manager decided to comp the entire dish. This indicated to me that the establishment aspires to be more than just a hip and trendy venue and they actually care about the quality of the food served and overall customer satisfaction. 

I would highly recommend this restaurant for a great dining experience.
