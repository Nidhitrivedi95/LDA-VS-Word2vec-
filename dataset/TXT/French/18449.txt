A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g I read a gushing review a few months ago about this place and after two trips in two days, I wonder why it took me so long to get here.

Guys aren't supposed to eat quiche, right? Well, screw that. The spinach and goat cheese one was awesome and just $5. Easily the best quiche I've had, not that it's a staple of my menu.

I also tried a little ham-and-cheese croissant that just made me want to order the bigger one. The previous day, I ordered the french onion soup. You might not believe this, but a French place does it pretty well.

The service is friendly, the kitchen got the food out fairly quickly and the portion size is generous for the price. Haven't dived into the bakery case beyond a lone macaron (which was good, not anything I'd get again,) but the cakes and tarts look like happy gut bombs. I'll be back here again ... next week.
