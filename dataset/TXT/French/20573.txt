AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw Only 49 guests allowed at any given time so wait times can be long without a reservation. Waited about 20 minutes for a table but were tended to immediately with server bring our beverages and water. Chef cooks in the middle of dining room so you can watch and eat as meals are prepared.  They have continental breakfast with croissants, fresh fruit, charcuterie, fresh squeezed juices and coffee.  I ordered the tomato, broccoli and mozzarella quiche with salad that had a tangy dijon vinaigrette that was delicious.  Will go back tomorrow to try the Chocolate Waffle with Nutella and banana compote.  Ummmm.  Can't wait.
