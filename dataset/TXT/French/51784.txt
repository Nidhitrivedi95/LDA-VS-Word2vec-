pmoIMK8zGWvKsVOPDBYfzg We got there a little later than our reservation time but all was good. Got seated at some awkward table that looked like it was for four but was longer than it was wider. My girlfriend and i didn't want to sit side by side so we moved to the ends. Why did we stay at this table for the remainder of the evening? It was in the corner and much more private so we liked it.

We ordered:
escargots de bourgogne
filet of beef
rack of colorado lamb

All was very very good and it was my girlfriends first time eating escargot. Shouldn't have brought her here because now she'll think that all escargot was this good.

Filet of beef was just like a super tender steak, super tasty, and good portion size with its sides. Rack of lamb was amazing. Probably one of the best I've ever tasted!

Very good experience, waiter service was great
