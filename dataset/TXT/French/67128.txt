USleI8g1UVN9-9jm-b4uIg Great for a special occasion! Amazing wine list and deliciously crafted plates!! Must make a reservation and sitting on the patio is lovely. Restaurant is in a house-turned-restaurant, so it has a fancy but homey feel. I definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting Charlotte!
