rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I dined here for outdoor Brunch on a beautiful day for Las Vegas. Trust me when I say sitting outside can be very uncomfortable most summer days. It over looks the pool and they have beach umbrellas set up with blue and white decor. First come first serve so no reservations and you may request the outdoor upon arrival if available. 

I enjoyed their baked pastries. They are known for their baked goods after all but I most enjoyed the croissants-both classic and chocolate. I actually thought the spiced donuts were okay but I liked the berry jam. 

For my entree I tried their special. It was an omelet with steak,asparagus, and mozzarella cheese. Sounds good right? I felt like I could have easily made it at home. The steak I think was the thing that made it okay with it being very salty and almost looked like leftover steak bits. They give you a choice of side of fruit, sausage or bacon and I chose fruit. I thought it would have been an assortment but it was just strawberries. Not a bad thing since I like them but what if you didn't? My guest had a waffle with nuts and caramelized banana. It was better than Mine but I already had enough sweets with the baked assortment we started with. 

Since there is always room for dessert we decided to try the pineapple rum dessert. I would only recommend it if you Love rum. I thought it was overpowering. I would have much rather liked it without the run sauce so perhaps ask the server if you can pour it on your own. 

This experience with food was not up to the expectations today but I have also experienced their dinner and throughly enjoyed it. The service was very good I just think I will maybe choose a signature dish instead of a special next time.
