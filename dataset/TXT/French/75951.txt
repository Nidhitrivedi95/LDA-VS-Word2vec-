My friend landed a groupon for Le Chalet so we went to check it out.

Ordered the Pate de Campagne and the Traditional Flammenkuchen as appetizers. We were immediately impressed! The pate was perfection, very creamy and not too fatty, accompanied by crisp bread. The flammenkuchen was like a pizza without red sauce, covered in cheese with some hidden onions and bacon. SO GOOD.

We followed this up with the Swiss Cheese Fondue. This came with french bread squares (you can have toased, we did) and apples. The fondue was by far the best I have had in a restaurant, the perfect combination of it's ingredients. We invested all of our energy into consuming every last drip of the fondue. 

I would like to say that we spent some time eating some other entrees, but as soon as we saw someone else getting dessert... we couldn't help ourselves.

We ordered the Nutella Crepe, Lemon and Sugar Crepe, and Carmel Fondue. This was no easy decision, as you will understand when you see their dessert menu. Luckily for us, I don't think that it much mattered what we would have ordered, as I felt that it was a sure bet that everything would hav been equally as delicious. We watched them make our crepes on closed-circuit tv. Then, we faught over every last bite of each desert, and I would have gladly bathed in the Carmel Fondue. 

I ordered a decaf coffee during dessert and it came in a single serving french press, also. How cool is that?!

Le Chalet will soon be seeing us on a regular basis. Guaranteed. There are about 10-13 more deserts that I will need to conquer and the list of Meat Specialties will certainly require some of my attention as well (the presentation of the La Potence was very intriguing)!
