Xa8aadsVfrqocGA_rVzsdA Located in the bottom floor of the Place d'Armes, I was hesitant to try this restaurant after reading the Yelp reviews. Our server was pleasant and became even more so once I replied to her asking in English what kind of water I wanted in French and a request for her to speak to me in French so I could practice mine. My father and I shared the scallop appetizer and the lobster and char appetizer. The scallop ravioli appetizer was the stand out of the two. We also were given an amuse-bouche of char and berry sauce. The char was prepared very well. For dinner, I had the special which was trout with mint pesto - very light and refreshing. My father had the boar with spices which he said was quite good as well. The portions were very satisfying as both of us left full and did not have room for dessert. All in all, I was pleasantly surprised.
