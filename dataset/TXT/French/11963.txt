4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Went on a Tuesday, place is nice and wait wasn't long at all. Waitress was a little slow and could have been more attentive. I ordered the Croissant egg sandwich it was okay. I also had the Blueberry French toast which are the bomb with their homemade whip cream. Cappuccino was really good but they don't really serve you much. Overall, pretty good but can't hold a match to the Pantry at the Mirage.
