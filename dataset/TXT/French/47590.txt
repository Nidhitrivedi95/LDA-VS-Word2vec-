O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q We dined on 10/26/12 while staying at the Palazzo. We were greeted kindly by the hostess. We ordered the east/west coast oysters after reading online that they have an oyster bar. They were delivered to our table with no explanation. There were three sauces that we navigated with no help from our waiter. Our steaks were prepared well but the Mac & cheese side was flavorless and the artichoke was overcooked and oversalted. The crab served with my filet oscar tasted a bit rancid. Our waiter was annoyed when we asked about the salts delivered with my husbands steak. We received far superior service from the support wait staff. We had a very good Pinot Noir, vantage point. Not worth a third of the $333 bill. This is my first negative review and I regret not reading the yelp reviews prior to making a reservation.
