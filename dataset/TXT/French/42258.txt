l09JfMeQ6ynYs5MCJtrcmQ My experience with this restaurant is a little mixed. I first came across Alize a few years ago, when I went there for dinner. The wait staff was not so good, especially for such a small, I guess you could call it cozy restaurant. The menu selection was about what you would expect from a restaurant this size. When the food got to the table it was flavorful and I was satisfied with the overall quality. 

Now with all that being said, I went back a few weeks later for their Brunch, which I have to say was FANTASTIC! selection was good and the service was better then what I had experienced last time I ate at Alize.

Hope that helps
