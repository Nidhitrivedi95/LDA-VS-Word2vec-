4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Lucky enough to get there before the big Sunday brunch crunch, so we had a great view of the fountains. Unfortunately they weren't on, but the people watching was a good substitute. The food and service were both great. We had the ham crepe, the salmon benedict and the fresh OJ. The day was beautiful. Can't think of a better way to spend a lazy Sunday morning.
