S5gtq6g6dIfyaFvyPYyzkg The Dome is a place you can hardly miss, standing proud on George Street.  As has already been mentioned, at Christmas it has some of the best decorations in the city, and it's a pleasure to go past here on the bus and gaze at the festive wreaths and assorted decorations.

The main reason I came here was for the food, having booked a table in the Grill Room restaurant.  The food I had here was brilliant, though not cheap.  It's the sort of place that you'd come for a special occasion rather than a regular night out.

Oddly, the thing that stands out about my meal here was the toilets.  Why were they so memorable?  They were probably some of the best presented men's toilets I have experienced in Edinburgh.  I'm so used to hearing about amazing women's toliets, whereas the men are left to have something quite dull and drab.

Everything about this place screams class and sophistication.  It makes you feel important to be dining there, and this is a feeling that I rarely get from restaurants in the city.  A great meal out.
