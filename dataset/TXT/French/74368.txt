xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g One of the most memorable restaurants, since my future husband to be proposed to me here, since we were in Vegas to celebrate our 5 year anniversary.  We sat next to the window and was able to watch the Bellagio water show and see the sunset.  

We ate the sauteed pork chop and Filet Mignon which was delicious everything was soft and was not over cooked. The finance tried a mojito and I drank the berry champagne, which was also good.

The waiter even help set up my fiance's proposal, I was already crying when the dessert came out.  Another customer from another table saw my fiance propose to me and told me to stop crying and bought us two glasses of champagne. How lucky were we! 

Again one of the most memorable restaurant, I would definately come back here every time I visit Las Vegas.
