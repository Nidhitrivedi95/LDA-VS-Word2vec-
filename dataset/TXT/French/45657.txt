The seating is bar style, which allows you to see the action in the kitchen and you also interact well with the staff and other guests.  My husband and I were celebrating our 8th wedding anniversary and we both agree it has been our best anniversary dinner so far. It is everything you expect of a Michellin star restaurant, I am sure the second star is coming soon.  We were pleasantly surprised that the sommelier was so helpful, since we first opted out on the wine pairing for the prefix menu and later had him come back and recomend a different wine for each dish. He recommended many excellent wines and even offered samples of several of them.  Unlike other high end restaurants where the staff can a little snobby, we felt very comfortable the entire meal.  As for the food, the moment I took the first bite I knew many had shed tears of joy in that restaurant before me.  My dinner was about three months ago and I can still remember it as clearly as if it was last night.  A peeled roasted bell pepper rolled into a taquito and stuffed with succulent tuna, a grapefruit jelly with diced avocado that cleanses your palate and prepares you for the next dish...wow, one masterpiece after another.
