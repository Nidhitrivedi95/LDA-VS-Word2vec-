_cjPEH9wXhKS-HQe_U3M4Q My actual rating is 4.5.

I had a chance to have lunch today at Le Select.  Instantly, I liked the place.  It felt spacious yet still had some elements of classic bistro charm without being gimmicky.  And I'm feeling the location;  I would like to go back in the summer and try their patio.

I shared the gravlax and tartare for an appetizer and it was absolutely delicious, but so rich!  This should have prepared me for the next round!  My Croque Monsieur was decadence defined!  There was so much yummy melted cheese that I could only handle half of the sandwich... and the frites were great too, but again, I had to doggy bag some.  From what I saw, no one can accuse Le Select of being tight on portions!  

Four of us shared a bottle of Chianti ($55) which we all enjoyed, but it was a tough decision with such an extensive wine list.

I want to return very soon for dinner and try out some of the other amazing dishes on the menu.
