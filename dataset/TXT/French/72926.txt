XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q I was here in April and was hoping I'd be in love but alas, far from.

As our orders were being taken, I asked for the sommelier.  Shortly after the order was taken, a complementary soup from the chef was served - still no sommelier.  I asked again and quietly refused to touch my food until a sommelier arrived.  I would say from the moment we sat down to a sommelier coming to our table was around 30+ mins.  Not acceptable to me, especially at a high end restaurant like this.

The other thing that was erie was how dead quiet everyone was.  I mean, NO ONE was talking in the restaurant.  I was afraid to talk because everyone would hear my conversation, even at a soft voice and if I whispered, it would be really obvious.

The food was great, but having lived and dined at some amazing restaurants in NYC, this really didn't blow me away.  It just wasn't AMAZING as I expected it to be.  It felt on par and some of it not as good as to what I've experienced at other before.  We had the Le Homard Roasted lobster in green asparagus jus with vegetable essence, Le Navet Rouge Carpaccio of lemon flavored scallops with red turnip and radish, La Langoustine truffled langoustine ravioli with chopped cabbage, and a few other dishes I don't remember.  The dessert though - that chocolate souffle was to die for!

This rating is for overall experience and value.  For as much as I paid, I could've spent 1/3rd of the bill and gotten an equally great meal in NYC (and the ticket to NY, at that!).  Service was nice and they were polite but it wasn't outstanding.  And I also asked about the complimentary limo service which wasn't available.  Sigh.  Maybe it was a one off but I'm not going back again....unless I only get that chocolate souffle.
