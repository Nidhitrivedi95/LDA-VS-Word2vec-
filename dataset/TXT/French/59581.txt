s11Ym0QX2Am2uwtnyou4GA My first time there and we had brunch. Waited our 30 minutes to receive our brunch with no notice from the wait staff. The rosti, a simple dish to make, was like hickory sticks, over cooked and cold. Salad was flavourless. Homefries were also cold. My charcuterie sandwich was dry and somewhat bland. The bread was grocery store quality. No excuse for this considering all the great bakeries in the area.  Some of the worst homemade hot sauce I've ever had. I should have made my own breakfast and saved the $40.
