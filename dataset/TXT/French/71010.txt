xcmmTXhuMx2fZF2Bt69F4w I wavered on giving this place 4 or 5 stars. I tried the eggs Benedict with crab cakes, which was (in a word) amazing. I would go back over and over just for that. I also tried the waffles, which were served with a lovely side of cooked fruit but were just a touch away from the fluffiness I would expect. And, I wish that they had coffee options beyond your standard drip. 

Otherwise, cute location and great staff.
