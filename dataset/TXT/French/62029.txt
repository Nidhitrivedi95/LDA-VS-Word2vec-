SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ Yum! Ordered the steak and a glass of red. Was waited on by Clay and asked him to plz match up my wine with my food. He did a great job! This is my second visit. The first time I had the charcuterie plate and a salad. This time, I'm a little more hungry and ordering the 6 oz filet. I'll let the photos speak for themselves. Good food and service. I want to say great yet the steak was somehow salty with no demo-glacé.  Nonetheless, I'll be back!
