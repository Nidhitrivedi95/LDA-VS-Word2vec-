QEgfK_TKY8bwK-YzKDdkGw I went here one weekend in Nov. 2015 and everything was great. Ramsey was our waiter and he was great and gave us some tips. I ordered the scallops and The chef also allowed me to substitute my Brussels sprouts for green beans, which a lot of times chefs do not allow at nice restaurants. I also ordered a few French martinis and they tasted great. The dining room was not too busy and the noise level and lighting were perfect.
