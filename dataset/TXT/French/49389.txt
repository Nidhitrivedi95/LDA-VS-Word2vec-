or4UVDjXEEjze3wNPjoAZA Loved it!  Our waiter Nick was helpful with food and wine recommendations.  The food was amazing, everything from the foie gras risotto to the creme brûlée impressed the palate.  This also seems like a nice place to have a drink at the bar.  I also had the filet with foie gras on top and was blown away by the flavor, and I am a little hard to please when it comes to steaks, this exceeded my expectations!  Will be back next time I visit Scottsdale!
