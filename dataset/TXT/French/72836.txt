XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q wow...after eating here, and dropping $$$$$ for the meal without wine, makes every omamakase dinner seem like fast food prices.  But it was quite an experience.
For the price, definitely you are paying a premium for being in Vegas...it was probably $ overprice...but hey, if you have that much michelin stars, i guess you can charge that much.  
You can request them to pick you up in a limo from your hotel...which was great, and you enter this special gated courtyard which is really elegant. 
so, food!  yup...as you can see from the pictures...they do well in presentation....and thankfully, it tastes as good as it looks.  I liked the combination of flavors, and each dish was very distinct and defined well. The bread cart is insane! as wierd as it sounds, the butter is also amazing...all the bread is so fresh and perfect.  You can get full with that alone...so dont go nuts. after that, you just eat what they give you... and if you have high cholesterol, this is probably not good for you... coz' its a lot of the good stuff that'll kill you. the flavors are diverse and well timed.  Prepare to stay there for 4-5 hours. In the end, the dessert cart comes out..and it is as impressive as the bread cart.  Don't be shy....take as much as you want! :)  they are so delicious! 
the decor was very tasteful and elegant...i'd return for a super special occasion or i'd like to try his other place next door.
