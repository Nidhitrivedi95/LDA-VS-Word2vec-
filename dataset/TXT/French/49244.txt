Or23g875aIDTGNwKQASQgA We enjoyed many delicious meals during our week in Montreal, but I dare say Candide was indeed the best. We were seated at the chef's counter and were overwhelmed by his attention to detail and his overall charm as he served us and described each dish in great detail. As we dined on the autumn menu, we awaited each course with excitement as we knew something special was on the horizon. Most beautiful of all was the setting. On a brisk autumn evening, the environment added a picturesque backdrop for a damn near perfect meal.
