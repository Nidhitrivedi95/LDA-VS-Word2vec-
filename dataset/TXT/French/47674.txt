O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q Went here with 2 of friends. We were looking for a great steaks. We got them here.

I had a New York Sirloin which was perfection. Friends had bone-in ribeye with lobster tails. Everything was perfectly cooked.

Service was excellent. Our servers knew we were looking to have some fun even though it wasn't a boisterous place. They didn't mind and had some fun with us.

Nice place. Worth every penny.

They also had a nice looking seafood bar, but we didn't try it.
