rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A If you are looking to eat at a place created by the "best chef in America" that you can afford-- Thomas Keller's Bouchon is it. The style of food is what makes the prices more affordable (but may I dare say still expensive) but the service still remains impeccable. 
As I was waiting for my party, servers graciously offered me water and refilled my glass three times. What was amazing was that EVERY time, they filled my glass with the same amount of water. I asked the server if they were trained to do this and they are! Amazing.What I disliked about the service was that the servers were not knowledgeable about the menu. 
The bread is artfully hand-made and delicious. I had never tried WARM pistachio but it was delicious and very fresh. First, I ordered the Soup du Jour (French Onion Soup) it was topped with melty creamy cheese just the way I like it. Also, I had the Salade de Cresson et d'Endives au Roquefort, Pommes et Noix. I can see the quality put into each leaf but the salad was not tasteful on my palate. I would not recommend ordering this. My friends also had Gnocchi a La Parisienne, this dish was AMAZING. The Gnocchi is not traditional but it tasted fried and it was delicious!! I would come back and order this dish again. WE also ordered three Fromages served with honeycomb. The honey was giving very sparingly and the cheeses were mediocre. They just started serving cheeses so I assume that the selection will grow better later. None the less, it was delicious and had excellent service.
