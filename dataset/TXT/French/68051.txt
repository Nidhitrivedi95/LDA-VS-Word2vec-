vg55SAkrEmuHpWfIMtJjBQ We had a really delightful meal the day before Valentine's day. We got seated early at 5pm, and the service was great and the food was delicious!!

We started off with the blue cheese egg tart on salad (it had a fancy name can't remember now) on top of some beets and greens. Served just warm, the tart itself was melt-in-your-mouth delicious and complemented the salad well.

I ordered a fish dish which was amazing. It was a white fish (bass or tilefish?) served with this really nice  tangy sauce which made it incredible. It was the perfect flavor combination that made each bite burst with flavor. It had some roasted veggies on the side. My husband got their beef dish and I thought the sauce it came with also made the dish amazing. They know how to make unique, savory sauces to perfectly complement the meats, and all the meats were cooked just right!!

I thought the dessert was just OK. I think it was cardamom ice cream served on top of rice, but the rice was not that great.

Overall, a great dining experience. I would definitely come back and eat another meal!
