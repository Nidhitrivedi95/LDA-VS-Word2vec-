_cjPEH9wXhKS-HQe_U3M4Q Need to get this out of the way now, this is hands down my favourite restaurant. I've been coming to this beautiful spot on Wellington St. W for just about 2 years now, maybe a dozen or so times, and have yet to experience any kind of "off taste", dry meat or anything even resembling inconsistency. It's as if the chef in the kitchen is a machine. From the duck confit to the seared red deer, everything here is delicious. Have gone with groups of 4 or more a number of times, so when I say everything here is amazing I know this for a fact, having tried everything on the menu. The appetizer I recommend is the "terrine de foie gras" served with a few pieces of lightly toasted brioche bread, the foie gras is extremely light and smooth as ever, turned into a pâté style dish with a marmalade on the side. It's one of the main reasons I continue coming to this restaurant. If you're a wine enthusiasts, look no further, their massive wine list will make your head spin, a wine for any occasion. When it comes to the desert, call me old fashioned, I need to go with the creme brûlée, I won't spoil your desert by glorifying it here, try it and see what you think. What more is there to say 10/10, 5 stars, 100% recommend this restaurant. They get very busy on the weekends, so if you're up to take your wife or hot date on a Friday night, reservations are a must. Bon appetite!!
