jo4KmAqlZ7vxjHIP7IIkAw Our time at La Gaffe will always be remembered as our most spontaneous, pleasant, and romantic eating experience in Toronto.  We had just finished touring the nearby Ontario Legislative Building during Doors Open, and were looking for a late-morning bite.  By simply "walking around" we eventually landed on Baldwin Street, where we found this little French gem.

At first we wanted to sit outside, but since the front terrace had no open tables, we were seated by the main entrance, off to the left of the bar.  This spot seemed to give us more privacy plus a nice window view of the terrace, which actually made the experience more intimate.  Our server was friendly and very generous.  Upon his recommendation, we started with a carafe of chilled Trius (local riesling) while sharing a tasty bowl of Mussels Marius.  My entree, the Omelette du Jour, was something I'd never tried before: eggs packed with chopped salmon, diced onions and peppers, and emmentaler cheese.  It was served over a bed of seasoned baked potatoes, alonside a fresh house salad, sliced melons and kiwi.  My wife had the Eggs Benedict, which came with the same sides.  

For as many varieties of egg dishes we've had since, we have yet to find many as good as these.  Everything was pure bliss, especially my omelette.  Very happy with the bill too.  An overall great and unforgettable morning in a vibrant and diverse city.  Looking forward to the day we can return.
