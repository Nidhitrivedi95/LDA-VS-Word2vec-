ovtlrcsVRlgZZQUlHs_ovw I want to like the food more than I actually do. Living within 5 min walk, I really want to love this place. The problem is the food is EXTREMELY inconstant and service is hit or miss and drinks are not well made.

The last three times I've been here I walked away disappointed. First was a filet dinner. This time, they actually nailed the cook temp but the filet was the smallest filet I've ever seen served anywhere and I literally went home and at after. I laughed when it came out. Second night was ribeye. Flavors were spot on. Quality of meet was acceptable for the price, but I ordered medium rare and it came out medium well. Since be flavors were good and I hate to complain I let it go. Tonight was the buffalo burger ordered medium rare again.  This came out well done (no pink at all) at very hot to eat. This time I complained because I like this place and want them to succeed. 

The burger came out the second time completely rare in the middle and medium around the edge area. My wife asked for a box so she could cook it later at home. 

Here is the problem and I hope the new owner is reading.  You cannot survive as an extremely inconsistent high priced non-chain in surprise. It's just not going to work, given the fact I've been here more than 20 times and have finally had enough. You can only have so many people than keep going because they want to like it. 

At this point it's drinks and appetizers for us or nothing. 

My suggests. Improve service quality (tonight was good but food wasn't), hire a real quality bartender, start sous vide your meats to reduce cook times, increase flavor and drastically increase consistency and offer more bang for the buck. 

The atmosphere is excellent. It's very relaxing and they have a few good drinks. I just can't have another $100 dinner in surprise I'm disappointed with.
