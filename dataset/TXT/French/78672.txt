ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug The food was not even mediocre. It was quite terrible. 
The service for ok - nothing great - the only person I actually wanted to pay was the busboy. 

Ordered a burger - medium well - bland - burnt. 
My friend ordered the turkey wraps and French onion soup - and was so sick the entire night - I would normally say it potentially could not have been the  food but that's all we had eaten the entire day. 

Avoid it. Paris needs to up its game.  Food is a big thing to a lot of people.  It could make a place ior break it. 

Dissappointed. 

Should have stayed at the Bellagio instead
