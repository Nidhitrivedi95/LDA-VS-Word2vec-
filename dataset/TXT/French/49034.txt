OL_dFyhAt3CVtbbS-DpgUw Although I have frequented Hogan's Pub on a few occasions I had not tried out their restaurant.  In short,  I wish I had eaten there sooner. Service was great. Staff were very friendly, food was delicious. I had the Mussels in a white Pernod sauce Mmmmm! delicious! We shared a platter of grilled Calamari. Yes I know......I followed this with Pesce Misto di Mare (assorted grilled fish). Didn't realize the portions were so generous. Needless to say I over ate.

Yes I was a total Miss Piggy I had dessert .......Creme Caramel  and Hogans  take on Irish Coffee. Between the wine, good food, dessert I literally rolled out of the restaurant. Awesome foodn nice ambiance. only draw back there is little to no parking. Maybe thats a good thing, a little walk down the road helps to digest all that wonderful food.

Plan on going again. Now that I know the size of their portions I will definitely order less food.
