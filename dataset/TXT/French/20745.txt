AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw The ham and swiss quiche was to die for. I don't think I've ever tasted something so luscious in my life. I wanted to savor every last bite. I highly recommend it! My mom had the eggs Benedict which was just OK in my book, but that was compared to the quiche. I enjoyed the atmosphere of the place and the chance to see the chef cook all of the dishes to order. The small intimate atmosphere was excellent. The decor was beautiful as well and I felt like I was in a french bistro. Overall loved the experience!
