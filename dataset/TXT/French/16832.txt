8xCiibfgqy-8xpCWEaguqg The service was very good so was appetizers and main but for me the dessert failed so I had to take some points off.  Otherwise I would have given this 4 stars.  If I did have time I would go back again, for the steak.

I had Escargots for appetizers - loved it.  Very aromatic with the herbs and I particularly liked the combination of the champignons with the escargots themselves.

For main I ordered the Grilled Top Sirloin with side of vegetables which included sauteed mushrooms, grilled red and yellow pepper and squash.  Steak was cooked perfectly medium-rare and I dare say it really was most flavorful steak I have tasted in a long time.  The slight charred flavor of the accompaniments and sweetness of the pepper played off the steak wonderfully.

I should have stopped there.  Being a dessert person, I tried the trio of minis - which was a butter tart with vanilla ice-cream, fudge brownie with caramel, hot fudge whipped cream and ice-cream and finally a passion fruit crème brulée.  Value for money, that seems like a great deal for $8.  However the best thing on the plate for me were the ice-cream.  The Butter Tarte wasn't bad and tasted a little like a pecan pie without pecan.  Brulee was fine but nothing to rave about.  Brownie was the biggest failure.  Probably made earlier in the evening and by the time I ate (wasn't that late, only 9pm) it was like a piece of dried chocolate cake drowned in overly sweet fudge sauce.
