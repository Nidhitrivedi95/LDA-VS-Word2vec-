HGDY8ZQkCmZ_d_OR_glSgA Le Gargote in my opinion is one of the best French Restaurants in the greater Montreal area.

Also one of the most popular and scenic locations, in the heart of old Montreal, you can sit bu the open fireplace sip red wine and eat very traditional French and Quebec fare. 

The exposed old stone walls and horse drawn carriages going by make you feel as though you are in Europe.

Now the food: Venison, veal, foux grais, duck confit, all with seasonal sides and wine parings.
I just melt or either can also get intimidated at the menu. 
Reasonably priced, abt. $25-45 PP.
