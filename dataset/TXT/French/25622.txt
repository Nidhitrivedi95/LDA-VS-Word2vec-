Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA MIX , to me is a place you REWARD yourself, for great food, fluid ambiance and thumbs-up service!

This is the very first time I spent 110/person for dinner, I knew it before we went there, a bit butterfly since I always have a doubt of the so-called"modern American" plus a French twist.

Well, I am glad my attempt was proved to be a unforgettable night!

I picked :

Tuna Tartar as the starter
Lobster Au Curry as the main course
House special cheese cake for savory dessert


I would say, honestly, all of the three stood out with nice surprise and consistent quality! 

Fresh, juicy, rich flavor for all the protein I chose. The texture is so important when I pick sea food since you can overcook them just in seconds. My lobster was so tender and tasty while not overpowered by the curry sauce around. Not easy at all! When the plate came I was like:" wow ,it is small", then I realize there was 4 or 5 piece of lobster meat without any shell, side veggie or so, PURE LOBSTER MEAT BITE, oh, sorry, a small portion of risotto, which adds more change of texture. I was full after the entree, I was happy like I was  in heaven!

All my co-guest were happy with their choice such as Prime Rib and Lamb chop.

Yay, Las Vegas will continue drawing me back since it is indeed the battlefield of sensational food, i The dinner at MIX is definitely a high-note of this trip!
