rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Was so excited to go to Bouchon and was thoroughly disappointed. Mainly because of the service. Our appetizers came out quickly and we enjoyed those. It was over 40mins later that we received our salads and soups (and after asking about them twice) and when they came, they forgot one soup and mine was completely cold. 
It then took a really long time to get our entrees and that too after asking about it. Our waiter was non existent, the busboys doing most of the serving. 
When the entrees arrived mine was completely overdone and when i asked the manager if she thought so, her response was "I don't know, it's dark in here."
They comped up the salads and have us dessert but we just wanted to leave at that point. I asked them to take off my meal which they did, though I could sense they were upset about it. Not as upsetting as getting your meal two hours after you sit down. 
Overall, not too pleased and my co workers who wanted to leave much earlier said they would never repeat.
