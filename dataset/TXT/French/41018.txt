kcF-en40P3J9L8nLy5lKqQ I think I really enjoyed the cheese plate last time I went.

I also went this year for the Restaurant Week menu.  Everything I ordered was not what I expected (gnocchi, pea soup, salmon, lamb chops).  The portions were a bit small (except for the soup, that was a solid 2 cups of puree), but we did leave full.  The menu is adventurous and creative - don't go unless you're up for it.

The desserts were probably the best part of the menu - german chocolate cake and cheesecake.  The cheesecake is super smooth and just about the best we've had in a long time.
