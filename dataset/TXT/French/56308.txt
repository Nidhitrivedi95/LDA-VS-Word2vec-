rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Brunch menu was hearty.  Our waiter attentive.  Bright atmosphere and food came out fairly quickly.  Delicious entries.  We had a hotel guest 15% coupon that we left in the room. We had already handed over card and signed bill when we remembered.  Although we could have easily gone upstairs to retrieve it, they would not readjust receipt.  That sucked.  Note to all; dont forget your coupons.
