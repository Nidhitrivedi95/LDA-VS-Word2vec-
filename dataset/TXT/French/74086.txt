xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g Went up here just for a few drinks.  One of my friends wasnt dressed appropriately and had to put on pants and a jacket that they have at the bottom of the elevator for such situations.  It made the whole thing sooooooooo funny that it didnt even matter that a round of 4 drinks was more than $50 - the view was awesome
