4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw What a fantastic restaurant!!! I recently stayed at the Paris Hotel and was delighted to learn they have Gluten Fee options within the hotel. I ate breakfast at this restaurant and I was blown away! I sat inside and it had a nice, classy feel. The waiter was very nice and friendly. I ordered the Gluten Free Eggs Benedict and was pleasantly surprised! The waiter recommended the heirloom tomatoes also and they were fantastic! The GF bread was AMAZING. Best GF bread I have ever tasted. I usually do not like GF bread so this was a delight. The coffee was great too. Mon Ami Gabi also has a wonderful outside patio right on the strip so you can people-watch if you like.
