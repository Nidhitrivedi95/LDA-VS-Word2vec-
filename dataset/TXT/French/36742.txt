IE-FSNn9Zx9YFx3nJV4C1A The concierge at the hotel recommended this restaurant, so on faith we accepted her suggestion and we are very glad we did! Such a cute place, with a great wine list, excellent ambiance, and the food was delicious. The fish & chips were some of the best I've ever had: lightly battered and with rosemary instead of dill in the tartar sauce. So good! Highly recommended.
