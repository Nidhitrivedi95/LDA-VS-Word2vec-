xcmmTXhuMx2fZF2Bt69F4w My boyfriend made fun of me for wanting to show up to brunch 20 minutes before Point Brugge opened. Five minutes before opening, like a flash mob, 15 cars pre-parked nearby the establishment opened their doors simultaneously and the line formed for Sunday Brunch behind us. What would follow would be one of the greatest brunch experiences I've ever had.

We were seated by Dana - I remember her name because she treated our table of 6 like old friends as soon as she met us. She was quick with the mimosas and the jokes, while also recommending her favorites from the menu.

Though a little cramped, it was an intimate experience and can easily sit small groups. The menu is almost entirely European-inspired and incredible. We all ordered something different so that we could try each other's meals - and no one was disappointed. In fact, we all ordered another mimosa and couldn't stop gushing about our awesome meal. I personally got the Baked Brunch Cassoulet and it raises the bar for what I expect from my brunch.

This visit also led me to return on a weeknight to explore the dinner menu. I ordered the Mussels, which confirmed that the chef's talents don't just reside in a few dishes but across the menu. Point Brugge is must visit for everyone in Pittsburgh!
