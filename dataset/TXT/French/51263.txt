P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ A wonderful place to get away from the strip in Vegas and have a spectacular meal. You can go with the tasting menu or order a la carte. I ordered a la carte and did not regret. The bread cart was amazing. If anything, I OB'd (over breaded), but the breads were so good!  Started with a foie gras bite then had a waffle. The amuse bouchée was a chilled corn soup with toasted quinoa and a tuna tartar. 

Started with the Mosaic of Organic Chicken, Foie Gras and Artichoke, Black Truffle Jus. It was delicious and had a perfect mix of the different ingredients. The second course was the truffle risotto. It was cooked al dente with lots of truffles shaved on top. Th waitstaff asked if I needed more risotto and truffles. What??? Who doesn't need more risotto and truffles. It was great.

Next had the Crispy Line Caught French Sea Bass with Delicate Spices and the Lobster, Ratatouille and Bone Marrow Raviolis, Carrot Purée and Natural Jus. Both we're wonderful but I preferred the lobster. I never had a waitstaff come to ask if I wanted more lobster but the waiter at Guy Savoy did. Of course I accepted. Lobster was fresh and succulent. Fish was crispy and flaky.

The final dish was Veal 3 Ways, Salsify and Chanterelles Jus. It was very good, especially the cheek, which was tender and melted in my mouth. The mushroom sauce was perfect for the meal.

This dinner rivaled the 3 Michelin star meals I have had in NYC and was better than some places that I have eaten at recently. I can't promise that you will get extra helpings of the things that you order but if you do, enjoy! From the service, ambiance and food, everything was perfect. I will
Definitely be back.
