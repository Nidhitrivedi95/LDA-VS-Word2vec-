4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I absolutely love this place! I go to vegas about four- six times a year and stop by this place every time and it has NEVER disappointed me!! They have the best scallop appetizer and shrimp cocktail! Their food is always on point no matter what i get and their service is top notch. They do have a patio seating but most times it is full (word of advise make rsvp!)
