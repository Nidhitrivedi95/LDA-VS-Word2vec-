c8j5MQqlb0RhgS_bpxMDuA Since us Montrealers are forced to hibernate for much of our long winters, the summer time is when we regain consciousness and park ourselves at the best terrasses Montreal has to offer. Boris Bistro is one of those places, with a great ambiance and a charming hidden terrasse that gives you a feel of the classic novel and film, "The Secret Garden." 

It can get really busy, so don't expect quick service at all times, but the staff makes up for it with their friendly and accommodating demeanor. I've eaten lunch here before and it was great, but I prefer to come for the Bistro's extensive cocktail and wine list.
