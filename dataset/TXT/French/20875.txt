AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw I love this place.  I didn't know this place existed until my sister mentioned it to be while my husband and I were in Vegas.  This place is located inside Casear's Palace.  We got lost looking for it.  I is next to the buffet.  Supposedly they are known for their pastries and sweets.  We didn't try those.  We opted for the dine in meal.  Their sit down restaurant is right around the corner from their pastry sweet shop.  There is a door you can just go through instead of walking around the corner.

I ordered the lobster Benedict on a croissant.  My husband ordered the chocolate waffles.  Both items were delicious and rich,  thinking about it is making my mouth water.  We will definitely be back if we happen to be in Vegas.
