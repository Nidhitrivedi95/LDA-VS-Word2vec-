Who writes their reviews?
They do obviously.
The croissants are sub par.
To give you the gist. If you go to your local Safeway or Krugers or cheapo grocery store at 10:30 at night and purchase the croissant they have had out all day after they defrosted it from yesterday you would be doing much better.
I ordered a side of maple smoked bacon.
I guess maple smoked to them means under cooked and dredged in maple syrup.
Please goes some place else. Any place else and you will be doing yourself a favor.
Now Mon ami! Stop writing your own reviews and spend your time learning how to cook!
Hacks.
Terrible.
