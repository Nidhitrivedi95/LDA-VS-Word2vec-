Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA This is a review of the restaurant on the 64th floor, not the lounge on the ground floor.  There is a difference, please note.  The restaurant is one of the most beautiful rooms I've ever had the change to be in.  The views outside in each direction are breathtaking, and the room itself is designed to look as if you are sitting at the bottom of a champagne glass full of bubbles.  The service was perfect, the waiter attentive and helpful.  All the other wait staff equally excellent.  There were 4 of us and each ordered something different.  Everyone raved about their choices.  Mine was the fish special of the day, delightfully prepared and presented.  Dessert choices were interesting but not the highlight of the meal.   I'd have my wedding reception on their outdoor balcony were I ever to get married again.
