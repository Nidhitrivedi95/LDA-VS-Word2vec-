w2tr0PA0b3tg8pId0kjM-A Weirdly I've never had a thing for macarons BUT my friends introduced me to macarons last summer and ever since then I've just fell in love with them. They're amazing! And recently this summer my friend took me to this place and OH. MY. GOD. I found my new go to place for macarons  so so delicious and good
