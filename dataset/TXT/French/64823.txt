TeUlBlNYodKBtcL-zc-4pA I couldn't be more bummed out that a place like this is closing its doors. I ventured there with three girlfriends on Tuesday night. It was the perfect quaint atmosphere I had hoped to find. Since Tuesday night is $10 Tapas night, we stuffed our faces with a variety of options. The Chef there knows how to pack alot into the tiny Tapas portions. 

They have a $25 wine menu (separate to their main) and we took advantage of that selection. I must say, I was impressed with the quantity of Ontario wines showcased at this restaurant.

The service was absolutely brilliant and the restaurant was simply wonderful. 

I'm sad to see this place go.
