kGOr_D-LNpgZ2M9N8TT4QQ In the heart of Yorkville, La Societe has the charm of a Parisian bistro and a lively atmosphere that hints of New York's Balthazar.  

We've heard a few of their seafood dishes didn't measure up, and that may be true but the Dover Sole was tender and delicious, as was the Steak Frites according to my hubby.

What could be improved on in my opinion is the Hosting staff. Who should be the customer experience ambassadors at any fine food establishment, La Societe's seemed unwelcoming and uninterested.
