d482l58ho0_IMdFkXX1F5Q This place is great!! People, if you think it's too expensive, the menu is right outside the door, you can see what you'll be paying, sheesh. This is a fancy place that is not too stuffy, it's a dinner out, dress up and enjoy it!!
The food is great, the desserts are AMAZING and so is the service. Rich was my waiter and was great!! I was eating out alone and he made sure I had a great meal. He gave great suggestions and was very attentive. 
Come for the desserts!! Robyn, the pastry chef is great!! Such creative and yummy desserts. I usually order about half of the selection...
I had to go down one star only because I got sick from the scallops. I think they were a bit underdone. I talked to the hostess about it and she apologized profusely and told the manager. 
Even though I got sick, I'm still coming back next time!!
