z6ZPIpO_1Rx69k9y2DQ7Bw The Decor is awesome .:.the food is horrid. I had their featured salad which had one grape tomato (cut in half), no olives, three small pieces of cucumber, two pieces of artichoke and more bland lettuce that could cover the plate (some of which were brown and soft).  There were five  people behind the counter and it took them 3 1/2 minutes to wait on us. I brought the salad quality to the managers attention and she said " oh they prep in the morning it was their fault". In no way would I return.
