qnFdBp12seAxwe2_iHM2bA Do not dine at this restaurant. Period. After arriving in Montreal from NYC, this was the first meal for my daughter and I. There was hardly anyone in the restaurant... may be 5 other tables! So why was the food so mediocre (deer tartare wasn't bad), but we waiting over an hour for our mains to come out and my daughter and I couldn't eat it. The food was over cooked (she had the Seafood Ravioli and I had the Cod).... Plain disaster. I waited way too long for a wine menu to order new wine and ended up giving up. Settled the bill and left hugely disappointed. Frankly, I'm more upset with myself for disregarding the many negative recent reviews. How the hell did this place get a 4.5 Yelp Review????
