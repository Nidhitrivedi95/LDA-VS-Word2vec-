SBnpT6JDbah-5l_52GM5sw Brunch is a meal that I rarely venture out for.  I see little appeal in rising early after a Saturday night of debauchery just to guzzle mimosas and eat eggs, but Sardine may have just become my Sunday morning salvation.

Last Sunday four friends and I ventured to Sardine just after 1 P.M. without reservations or calling ahead to be seated immediately.  The restaurant was completely full but our server Adam greeted us quickly.  The noise level was high, but tunes by The National, Arcade Fire, and other great hipster jams provided  a comfortable noise cushion.

We started off with mimosas which were perfectly balanced, crisp, and sparkling.  Round two consisted of Salty Dogs which are simply a greyhound variation served tall with a salted rim and a fresh slice of grapefruit.  Both drinks offer an effective defense against the common cold, scurvy, and sobriety making them a winner in my book.

I settled on the pork sausage dish which came with a fresh salad and two eggs any way you'd like (over easy in my case).  The sausages were well spiced and exceptionally flavorful. A crispy risotto cake was wonderful change of pace from ordinary potato variations that are ubiquitous on brunch menus.

Sardine is a great brunch spot that I will return to for it's food, service, and ambiance.
