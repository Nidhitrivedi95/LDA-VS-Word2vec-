Started off our Saturday night here. Concierge had put us on the guestlist, so it was free for girls and $10 for guys to get in. 
Took the elevator up to the 64th floor, and the setup was pretty cool. The DJ was playing some decent house music. 
Got a Whiskey on ice ($10) and two martinis ($13 each) and hit the patio to enjoy the view. 
It was a pretty hot night, so the patio felt like a damn sauna, but we hung out for a little while and enjoyed the view of the whole city. 
After a little while, the DJ decided to switch up her playlist from house to rap from the 90's (as far back as 2Pac - "I get around"). 
The girls wanted to dance, so we grabbed some more drinks and went to the little dance floor. It can't be more than 20x20, and I don't think there's a sound system/speakers there, but we still had a good time. 
Bartenders were all cool, and so was the crowd, and since we were there so early (from around 11:30 to 1a), there wasn't a wait for drinks. 
If you're looking to have a chill night, come here.....or you can start off your night here before heading out to one of the other clubs.
