9iy6scMRbs5ue41XRLGEkw My husband brought me here last Friday night for our anniversary. Ever since I graduated from Le Cordon Bleu in 2007, authentic French food has always been my favorite cuisine. I have been to a lot of restaurants, and have worked in quite a few fine dining restaurants as well, 3 of which were French/Creole-Cajun. I have to say I was impressed with this restaurant! We sat outside that evening- the hanging lights added a romantic touch. We ordered the crab cakes and Escargot for appetizers and the escargot was delicious! It did have a sauce that wasn't a true butter sauce, but either way, I liked it! My husband had the Seafood stuffed Pork Chop and I thought he was going to lick the plate clean. I had the Filet Mignon (medium rare) that was like heaven in my mouth. I was always taught by my chefs that any filet cooked more than medium is a waste of meat- so I've always ordered rare/medium rare, and I'm glad they actually know how to properly cook their meat! Most restaurants will turn a perfectly good steak into tire rubber aka well done. My asparagus and potatoes were tasty as well. Even though we were stuffed, we decided to order their Creme Brûlée. My final reason for giving them the 5 stars is because they made it right! It had Vanilla Bean which is key for Creme Brûlée- I hate going to restaurants and it either not being cooked properly, the sugar not being burnt right, or worse, adding some kind of flavoring to it. Their Creme Brûlée was perfect!   We will definitely be back. My only suggestion would be to play French music...again, we sat outside so maybe they play it inside? Makes me miss working in a French restaurant...
