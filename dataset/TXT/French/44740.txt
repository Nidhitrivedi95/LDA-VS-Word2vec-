mnn--vaYHtNyBNYFYBFIog Definitely recommend making a reservation. We had one for two on Friday night at 9:30PM - we showed up about half hour early and they made room to take us. Excellent service at the front door. Actually a little TOO buttoned up for my taste. Would've liked to see something a little more casual. The decor was eh, honestly not the best but the food was incredible. I shared two appetizers and two entree's with a friend and it was definitely enough food. We had the pork and the duck - both were excellent  the duck in particularly was some of the best I've ever had. My first time trying duck heart - and it was amazing. Surprisingly, loved it. The cocktails were also stand out - very very fresh - one of mine even had little edible purple flowers in it. Overall - great place for fine dining in Montreal!
