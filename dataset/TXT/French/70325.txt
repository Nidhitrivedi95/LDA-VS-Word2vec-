X8lYvkI2Yv7f96cz4uE9LQ Amazing restaurant which manages to stand out even in Montreal, a city filled with amazing restaurants.

This is a small (24 seat?) restaurant, with challenging reservations on most nights. However, the food, service, and experience are totally worth it.

My dinner companion and I split two tasting menus (the meat menu and fish menu), with wine flights, cocktails, and tip, for about CAD 130 each.  Each dish was interesting (although with a focus on quality of ingredients and preparation, not "weirdness"), and good wine accompaniments.  Probably the best was the lamb dish, although really everything was good.  Unlike a lot of
tasting menus, each dish was pretty substantial, with more than enough to share a few bites.

I'll definitely go back when I'm in Montreal again.
