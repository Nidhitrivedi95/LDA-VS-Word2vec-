bEVWHtBRYVwqaaNF4mWNYg I was in Toronto on business last weekend and Friday night was looking for somewhere fun for dinner with a client.

Coquine filled the bill perfectly.  Interesting mix of people, a tad cougarish until about 9:00 when a younger crowd seemed to show up.

Food was good.  NY Strip Steak and Frites...yummo.  Steak was cooked perfectly.  My client ordered the Veal Liver and it was actually VERY good.  And I hate liver!

Jeff was our bartender (usually sit at the bar for dinner when with clients as one is less forced to make small talk).  He was great.  Friendly, accommodating etc.

Quite reasonable.  Good vibe.
I'll go back if I get a chance.
