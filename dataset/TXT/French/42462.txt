LdD0yYLcHuamULrvZYY3Jg This is one of my favourite restaurants. Whenever I am in Montreal I plan a trip to this restaurant to stuff myself.  I go to the SAQ and stock up on some good quality wines and invite my friends. This is excellent quality food at very reasonable prices and deserve a good quality wine to match.

The filet mignon is the stuff of dreams, I have never had better. The appetizers are always interesting and just the right amount. The desserts are exquisite, the Mort de chocolat is orgasmic! In fact, just writing this makes me want to hop on the train to go back for another dinner. I really think this is one of Montreal's finest!
