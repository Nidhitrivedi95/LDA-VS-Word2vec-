Despite the restaurant itself having a pretty modern and hip decor where they could easily follow other restaurants in the trend of charging higher for style instead of substance, they have had enough restraint to keep the prices decent.

The BYO aspect also make it decent as you can easily provide as much liquor as you want for your meal without getting charged a restaurant markup for your wine.

The food they serve is a fusion of Italian and French and while no dish really stood out as being truly innovative for fusion, their dishes are tasty enough to warrant repeated visits.

They are most famous for their Moule Frites which a few friends who were with me decided to order and were more than happy with.

I ended up getting the special Chicken Supreme which had a pretty comical name in my opinion but turned out to be quite delicious.

It was a chicken stuffed with canneberge, caramelized apple sauce and pears.

The desserts were all very delicious with Tiramisu being the fan favorite at our table.

Service was attentive and efficient, with finished plates always being cleaned up within minutes of completion.  This might have something to do with the long lines that this place can see, although at no point during the meal did we feel rushed.
