58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw A great brunch spot!  I was skeptical of any restaurant in the old port area because it's just overrun with tourists (myself included), but I was quite impressed by my meal here... the highlight of which was a slice of thick grain bread, toasted and served with an apple puree spread and topped with blueberries.  It was just a part of the crepe dish, but blew away the main course altogether.  This will be my brunch spot for future Montreal visits.
