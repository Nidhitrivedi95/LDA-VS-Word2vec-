Some thoughts:

I was one half of a two-top, but was seated at an uncomfortably crowded four-top, when there were several two-tops available that looked like they had more comfortable seating.

I thought the menu was deliberately pretentious and catered way too much to francophiles, but I maneuvered my way nonetheless.

My burger was perfectly cooked, but came with no sauce ,which made for a weird dilemma: juicy and simultaneously dry.  No mustard?  Really? 

I also ordered a side of macaroni and cheese, which my server forgot.  My sister reminded him of this and he admitted that it had slipped his mind, which I appreciated.  I'm a server, too, and these things happen.

He took the mac and cheese off of our check (unnecessary).  The macaroni and cheese was good, but tasted like it had ham in it, although there were no pink chunks.  I don't eat pork, so this was kind of a  dilemma.  I decided it was best not to ask.

At any rate, I'll probably be back.  They offer Pimm's!
