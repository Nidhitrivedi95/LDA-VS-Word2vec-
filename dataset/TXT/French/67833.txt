Great room, hit and miss but more hits than misses food - miss and miss service. 

This was a highly anticipated Resturant when it opened and for a couple of months they did well - since then the service joined most of the rest of the Resturant at the Distillery District - as in mediocre and frustrating. 

We had a couple of drinks and desert at the bar a few nights ago - we had to work HARD to get then attention of the over grown child (about 45 going on 12) at the bar who was doing a bad job at flirting with the two ladies (only clients) in front of him. Shame since the drinks were great and the desert beautiful (candles, dry ice, good taste - someone Is trying here). We would ignore this if it was a one time occurrence but sadly this is regular occurrence at Cluny.

Rik, I appreciate you writing back. We visited after a show at Soulpepper last Friday, September 2nd around 10:30 PM.
