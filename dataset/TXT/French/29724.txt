fFInb4Dl2Ix4iE-VOltbkQ This was the second time we went to this restaurant.  The first time impressed us so much we figured we would go again.  The second time was even more impressive than the first time.  The service is top rate.  It perfectly balances friendly & professional.  Our waiter selected a  wine that went perfectly with our meal.  The meal we had blew us away.  Steak with a madeira sauce, probably one of the best steaks I've ever had.  Foie gras potine that was the perfect size for one person.  Though we split it and were still satisfied.  We will definitely be coming here again!
