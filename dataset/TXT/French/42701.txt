LjOBNcNNpuewBqSPxYYTJQ I have to admit, being from Seattle I was not confident on finding a cafe in Charlotte that would serve a decent latte, but this particular location made me into a believer!  I've tried their Uptown location a few months ago and I was not impressed.  Clearly the baristas here knew a thing or two (maybe they can train their other locations??) none the less, thoroughly impressed... there's 3 baristas at this location that nail it every time, there is one particular barista who is not consistent ... enough overall a great place
