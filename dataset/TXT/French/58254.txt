rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A If I could, I'd give Bouchon 3.5 stars-- a good, but not great experience.

FOOD: I had the roasted chicken, which was superb (a 5 star dish).  The french fries are about as good as any you'll ever have.  The rest of our dishes were fine, but not great (Croque Madame, Chicken & Waffles).  

SERVICE: The service was a bit of a disappointment.  Slow, and with a surprising lack of information about the menu.  

ATMOSPHERE: It's a French bistro-- not a fine dining restaurant.  So, it's loud, and busy.  The atmosphere is fine for what it is... but don't go there expecting fine dining and a quiet atmosphere.

IN SUM: Again, it's a good, but not great experience.  The roasted chicken was a real highlight.
