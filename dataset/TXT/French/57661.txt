rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A It was good, but very pricey.

I could overlook that if I did not leave hungry.
It was a good French restaurant, but the atmos needs a bit of work.
Maybe a nice piano tinkling in the background

Getting to it was a bit of an adventure,
We walk to it from the ventian, and ended up been sent out a car park, around to elevators, and so on....
All in all a good experience, but left me wanting more.
