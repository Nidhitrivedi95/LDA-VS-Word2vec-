xaqW4NkmUCGRRjmLxiFJ6Q The Big Bird savory crepe had oven roasted turkey breast, lettuce, kosher pickles, green peppers, avocado, havarti cheese, and mustard.  This was all wrapped up so nicely in a thin layered crepe.

I was pleasantly surprised at how such a crepe with simple ingredients could taste so good!  It was really fresh.  I remember the lettuce was crispy and crunchy.

It was a light savory crepe for a small lunch.  It was really good and if something so simple tasted so good, I can only imagine that the other heftier crepes will be delicious too!

I heard that they also have crepes with crickets on them.  I will have to return in the future someday to try them out.
