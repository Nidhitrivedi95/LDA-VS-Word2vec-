V-GKJwamXPIxSwecZdcPYw Definitely becoming a go-to place for me. The food is great, mostly traditional Italian with a few southern favorites (like sweet potato fries!) thrown in. The antipasto salad is one of the best things I've tried so far, along with the lasagna. In all honesty, most of my trips have been strictly for drinking. It's a great option for those in the Ballantyne area as it is technically in South Carolina and thus the cost of drinks is much lower. They usually have Jello shots and pineapple shots (pineapple slices soaked in malibu/rum mix) for $1 every day of the week, very delicious! Plus the bartenders are really friendly and attentive. The bar area is a little small, but I've never not been able to sit right at the bar. Plus, they have TVs in the general seating area so if you end up over there you can still watch whatever game is on. Another plus, they have Buzztime trivia for those trivia-addicts like myself. This place is definitely worth a try!
