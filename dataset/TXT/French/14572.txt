5EIuCcoHY2evAhFMBV6G6g Outstanding lunch spot.  Dinner slightly underwhelming.

Another find in my crawl through the Venetian trying to avoid food court food while grinding my day away.  

The lunch menu offers very good soups, salads and sandwiches.  Smaller portions but delicious.  The classically French, lobster bisque is rich, velvety, and delicious.  Topped with creme fraiche and bits of lobster that just make this comforting classic.   Escargot is also good eats.  Prepared in the usual way but brought to life with some fresh frisee tossed in a truffle vinaigrette.  Finally, the charcuterie.  Nice selection of cured meats and pate.  Add some bread and a glass of wine. Oh yeah. (So sometimes I drink when I play poker; no law against that).

Only fault, the Croque monsieur.  At first glance it nears classic perfection then you bite in and... creme fraiche?  That's like putting mayo on a hamburger.  Sorry to my Canadian friends.

Dinner adds some excellent dishes but looses the cafe feel.  Standouts include the seared foie with an outstanding mandarin orange relish and vanilla sauce, a fantastic poached pear salad with salty, pungent goat cheese, and an outstanding bouillabaisse.  Every piece of seafood cooked perfectly in the deeply flavored, seafood broth.

The wine list is almost entirely French. Very well chosen with good emphasis on lesser growths and regions.  Very good offerings by the glass.  Pours are small, prices are high.  Bottle pricing is much better and lower than most in Vegas.

Service is OK.  Can be slow at times if large groups come in.  Sit at the bar and its all good.

Recommended.
