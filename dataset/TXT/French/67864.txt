V0iYi5OjdRcz82m95jV7vQ Since the Kouign Amanns are only available on Fridays and Saturdays, I set my alarm for Saturday morning to make sure I got to Renaissance early! I think I was the first person in at 7:10 a.m., which meant the Kouign Amanns were still warm. Mmmmm.

Renaissance was a little tricky to find since it's in an unassuming strip mall on South Blvd (in the same building as Monsoon Thai near Mac's), and the place is tiny. There is a small table with two chairs, but they look more like decoration than a place to sit and eat, so I got two Kouign Amanns and a cheese danish to go. 

I got them home and gave the fella the danish and gave the Kouign Amann to my belly! I'd never had one before, but it was dense... chewy, caramelized sugar dough around the perimeter and fluffy, buttery dough in the middle. The fella said the danish was solid, but we split the second Kouign Amann, and he said that was definitely the winner.

It was only $12 for all three pastries, which I thought was pretty reasonable. There was a MASSIVE almond croissant in the cabinet that I'm already dreaming about for my second trip.
