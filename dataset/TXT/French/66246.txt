Pair that with a no-filler menu of superbly put together classic French bistronomy.   This is not a place of experimentation, it's a place where the tried-and-true shines.    A place where they get the bread and butter absolutely right.  

That's not all.  It's the small touches.   It's the way that all of the wait staff utilize French phrases as interjections.    It's the way the angled dining room creates moments of urban bliss as the headlights of passing cars gleam in creating a sense of movement and moment.   It's the way the glass doors open up into the theatre next door creating a seamless connection and inviting the world in.  

Ten years ago, if I told you that one of the most exciting corners of Toronto was becoming Dundas and Carlaw your jaw would drop in shock.     

Now as the city grows, this is the perfect compliment to what's becoming a magical neighbourhood.
