Duck in a can is great but not my favourite, though the presentation is cool. Absolutely get the fois gras poutine, but be sure to have your cardiologist on speed dial first. Try the blue cheese/apple/endive or the beet/goat cheese salad - ithey are delicious, and will make you feel slightly less guilty about everything else you've ordered. And make reservations in advance, especially if you plan on going on a weekend.
