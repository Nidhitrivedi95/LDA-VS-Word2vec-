d482l58ho0_IMdFkXX1F5Q I had the iceberg and blue salad, it was very good, yet one would of been enough.

I had the flat iron steak and it was cooked to perfection and very very good.  Melted in my mouth.  

For dessert I had to have the GRAND MARNIER SOUFFLÉ.  It did not disappoint.  

Service was good, water always filled.

The menu online, not all was offered, which is why I piked the establishment, why I took off a star.
