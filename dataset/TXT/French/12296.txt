4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I have had many good breakfasts here.
I decided to try dinner. It was a casual, not crowded early evening. Appetizers were fine. Wine was fine. When the steak was brought out it was well done though had asked for medium rare. I kindly asked  that they try again. The returned steak was a poor cut with seared rare preparation. Away from the outer edge, the steak had garlic and pepper flakes. Absolutely inedible. I did ask to talk to the manager. He was too busy. I simply paid my bill and left.
Will never return again
