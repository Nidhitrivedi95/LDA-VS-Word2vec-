When I ate here, a group of American students nearly skipped on their bill, so the waitstaff were super edgy afterwards and one of them confronted me as I was leaving: "Did you pay?", he asked, which was a bit startling considering I paid with a credit card about 5 minutes prior!

In any case, I don't think I'll be coming back...I just can't justify the cost.
