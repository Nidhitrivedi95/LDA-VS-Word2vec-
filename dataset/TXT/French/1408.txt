_T7f2wUgNlJqxsR-cR89SQ I enjoyed myself there.
Dishes I ordered are:
foie gras - I love to eat foie gras and this one is good. but it is a little bit too much. I finished the foie gras and felt full after this first course.
duck - I generally like it but not that special
coconut cream pie - it has been recommended by so many people and is actually the one that I expected most. maybe because i am already very full after the main course or because of the high expectation, the coconut flavor and the crispy pie is appeealing but I just didn't finish it.

there is a beautiful view of the outside, especially if you sit near the window. and yes it becomes a little bit noisy from around 7pm.
