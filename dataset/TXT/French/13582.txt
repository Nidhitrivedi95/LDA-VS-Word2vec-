4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw This is a wonderful restaurant... part of the "Lettuce Entertain You" group. The "cafe" on the strip is directly across form the Bellagio Fountains so the view is amazing... there is both inside and patio dining and a small bar. The bread is warm in a paper sleeve... Yum.... and the food is fantastic. The entree salads are really nice too. Love it...
