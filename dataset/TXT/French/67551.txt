UxWH8zRYIBgs6Q2oykvRdw So there seems to be a few themes in previous reviews for this place.  Mine is fairly consistent with what others are saying but I'm a bit more generous with my star awarding - and for a few good reasons.

First of all - the service.  Basically - terrible.  Our cocktail order took forever to arrive (so much so that we questioned whether she forgot).  At times our server was attentive - at others, gone for good.  Overall, this was a disappointment.  She redeemed herself however by noticing a special occasion card on the table and bringing free dessert to celebrate.  This was something I've never seen done before - noticing the card but not being asked for anything - and I was quite touched by the gesture.

Food wise - very mixed.  Two of us had salads to start - both were OK.  I tried the fancy Caesar which I spent more time cutting up than eating.  The other two had French onion soup which was, to be honest, terrific.  Our mains were two steak frites - delicious.  The other two had the lamb which was so bland it was literally shocking.  I felt bad for the two that ordered it - listening to us rave about the steak while they ate salty, tasteless meat.

Would I go back?  Maybe for soup and steak.  The reviews are very mixed for this place and I believe that's definitely warranted. Seems to be a toss-up whether you'll have good food or service.  Something to be aware of.
