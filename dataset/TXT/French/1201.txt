_O12nlv3sISPfiNAQVLM4Q The place looks like it needs a refresh but the food made up for it. We had a slightly longer wait than normal for a table of 6. I really enjoyed the trout with almonds,
Buttery mashed potatoes (server said it's 1:1 butter to potatoes which was believable) and spinach. The trout was a touch salty but still good and perfectly cooked! One of the top trout dishes. 

Server was friendly and funny. He spoke English to us which was great. Everyone enjoyed their meal at our table - from lobster to risotto with scallops. I would highly recommend the trout.

They were able to serve gluten free options.
