We came on a weekday, and it was pretty full already. The menu is a pseudo all day breakfast fare with some lunch options too. 

I like that they have something different. Farcous is a spinach pancake, flat and crispy. They have a traditional which is mixed also with red onion and cheddar, among others like with smoked meat. It comes with a big salad.

My friend got the ploughmans platter, a mix of smoked salmon, hard boiled egg, pate with a salad and other things. It was okay, and perfect to share both dishes. 

I wouldn't come out of my way to eat here, but if you're in the area, definitely check it out.
