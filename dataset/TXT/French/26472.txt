D7CnTsm8SCmbQghz1ioPdw so good! the bartender and waitstaff were beyond awesome with their enthusiasm and friendliness and pretty accents (yes, i'm american...). Got an instruction on a classic Montreal drink, the bloody Caesar, like a bloody mary but with Clamato juice instead of tomato. Yes, Clamato, half clam, half tomato juice, SOOO tasty. Don't leave MOntreal without trying a bloody Caesar!

When the rest of my party arrived, I was treated to an equally good meal. I splurged (on my boss's dime) on the big game meal of the day, a bison cut over mashed, sprinkled with a hefty dose of bison marrow. Bison Marrow, my new favorite kind of marrow (although generally whatever the last type of marrow I've had is my favorite, but still). anyway, the best restaurant I've tried in Montreal, the only competition was which was better, the L'Orignal Service, the L'Orignal atmosphere, or the L'Orignal Food.
