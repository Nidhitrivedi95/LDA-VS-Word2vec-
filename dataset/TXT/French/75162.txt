XZ7eQLjyGXf6y69UT4SGhg This is such a quaint adorable place, I LOVED it. The Nutella brioche is the best and their coffee is perfect. I've also tried the croque monsieur, quiche Lorraine, Nutella crepe, and pain au chocolate (which was just ok to me). I can't wait to come back for coffee and a Nutella brioche!!
