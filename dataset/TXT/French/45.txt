We ate outside and it was a wonderful experience.
They have a very nice inside eating area too.

Great place for a date or special evening out.

Our server was great and most food items were very good.
Trie 8 different plates among the 3 of us and the only weak plate was the shrimp appetizer. Rarely order a steak, but the ribeye was the highlight of the meal.

It's a bit expensive, but a very nice restaurant.
Definitely need a reservation for the weekends.
Looking forward to my next visit!
