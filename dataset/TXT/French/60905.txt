SD7vTf-H00J8BS3L-kt7jg From the moment I walked in, I was quite impressed. A mix between hipster and a classy vibe/atmosphere. I went with my boy and definitely could see myself taking out a beautiful woman on a date here.

We were seated, the music was a tad bit loud but enough to have a conversation. I went for the whole cornish hen and unfortunately, it was sold out by the time I was seated at 10pm. So I went for the salmon fillet and mushrooms/sweet potato fries as my sides.

Salmon fillet was good but not worth the price. The mushrooms were okay, also not worth the price but the sweet potato fries were excellent.

The service was great. All in all, I'll give Grinder a 4 stars because of their design, location, service, and good food.

Would I come back here? Possibly.
