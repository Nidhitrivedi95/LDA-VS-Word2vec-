4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Such a romantic restaurant.....get outside seating if available. We are able to watch Bellagio's waterdance show from our table. I prefer only coming here for breakfast and thats the only thing I can review on. Service is average and food is enjoyable. Those lemon pancakes.....yumms!
