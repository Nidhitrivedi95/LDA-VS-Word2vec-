ME6D5nLlfG0xZCtICOYDuw Our recent meal at George's during restaurant week was absolutely amazing.  I had never been before, but now can't wait to go back during my next visit to Charlotte.

We were able to snag an early dinner reservation despite being restaurant week, and were seated right away after taking advantage of the free valet parking.  My parents and grandmother took advantage of the $1 oysters as a pre-appetizer.  

We all opted for the mixed green salad to being with which came with lardon (aka amazing bacon).  I couldn't resist the Chevre & Mushroom ravioli, and it was absolutely amazing.  As in top 5 or 10 dishes I've ever eaten amazing.  As in horrified when my mother asked the waitress to take away her unfinished plate of ravioli without offering me the rest.

Anyway, we all got the Pecan Bread Pudding for dessert that despite not being super warm, was delicious as well.  They had a special bottle of wine for ~$32 that my dad and I shared and was very good.

Service was excellent despite the restaurant being pretty busy by the time we were done with our meal.  George's will definitely top my list of go-to places the next time I'm in town!
