JePdoHGJ2kWRQkfGx0T34Q The chicken was good...tender, well seasoned, etc.  Because the sandwich wasn't described on the menu I didn't expect him to douse it with mayo and add mustard.  I've had sandwiches at several portuguese chicken places, and have never had this happen.  He also poured a ton of sauce on it which made the bread really soggy and completely impossible to eat while walking down the street, which was my intent.  All in all, I probably won't be back given the variety of other portuguese chicken options in my neighborhood.  But if you do order the sandwich, make sure that you specify how you want it.  In terms of service, the guy working was very friendly and the sandwich was a decent price ($6.50, I think).
