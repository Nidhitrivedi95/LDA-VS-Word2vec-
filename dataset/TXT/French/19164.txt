aSC-WLyJptVpziJpR98Ykg Ate there a couple months ago and am just getting around to writing a review. The appetizer I had at Chez L'epicier was the best course I have ever had in my entire life. I had the Steak Tartare on some sort of Asian Fried Leaf thing. I eat very quickly... too quickly in most instances... I hadn't finished my appetizer of Steak Tartare by the time some people had finished their main course... I never wanted it to end. I have never eaten so slowly and enjoyed a course more in my life. The rest of the meal was excellent but not even worth reporting on compared to the appetizer. I am hoping Laurent Godbout opens a restaurant down in DC.
