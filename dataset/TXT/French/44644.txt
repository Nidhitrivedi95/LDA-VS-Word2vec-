mnn--vaYHtNyBNYFYBFIog Really good French refined food made by the best ingredients , the tasting menu takes too  much time   so I ordered the dish of fish fletan with risotto and shrimps and it was excellent , my friends had other dishes which amazed them , I would highly recommend this place , it is worth the experience the staff very attentive , the service excellent and the ambience one of the best , would really come back
