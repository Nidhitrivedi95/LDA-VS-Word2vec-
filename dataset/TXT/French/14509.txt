5EIuCcoHY2evAhFMBV6G6g I was here for drinks and appys so I don't know how it does for a full meal.  Darker wood decor, I suppose to be french inspired.  Service is good and food came quickly.  Nice wine selection.  I can't recall everything I sampled that night but I was generally happy with the quality, but not enough to come back for a full meal considering the other choices in Vegas.
