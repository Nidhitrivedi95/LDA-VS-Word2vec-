jLxeBgWhLRbII2ACkgH1Sg Having had this place bookmarked for ages, I was so excited to finally give them a try!

I ordered the following pastries to try: lemon tart, kouign-amann and an almond croissant. I can never resist lemon tarts and this was perfectly citrusy and tart. Lovely dessert. The kouign-amann and almond croissant were perfect. Exactly what I was looking for in a quality pastry. 

I don't have a huge sweet tooth, but when I'm craving sweets, these are exactly what I'm looking for. Not overly sweet and really tasty. I can't wait to come back and try more of their savory and freshly made menu items.
