50-xiTYmE6NERi-yJ6NvHw I should start off by saying that in general, I am not a fan of O&B restaurants - I find them to be overhyped, and often overpriced for what they are. 

I did however, receive a gift card to the O&B empire and decided on Biffs as I had never been there before. I will just talk about food and service (ambience, decor etc were all fine).

Food

We took advantage of the buck a shuck oysters - fresh, shucked perfectly - no complaints. Great price without it being bargain oysters

The crispy pig ears were out but our server suggested the chicken liver parfait. It was delicious and they gave you a very generous portion of pate - lets just say we had over half remaining! Very smooth, delicate flavour

My boyfriend got the prix fixe - mushroom soup and braised ribs, whereas I just got the steak frites. The mushroom soup was delicious, light, full of flavour.
The braised ribs were good but nothing spectacular. I make similar ones and I thought they were similar tasting (and I am not a great cook by any stretch of the imagination). My steak was overcooked and just meh - honestly the keg does a better steak.

Service

Our server was excellent. He was busy so forgot to come back to check if I wanted wine (in all fairness I was waffling) but there were plenty of other people checking in on us. The people who served us the food didn't explain it (say that the pate comes with house made mustard!) but it didn't dampen our experience.

Overall; its fine, not great. For the price (around $150) I would prefer other places in the city with more spectacular food. I'd come back for the oysters but would have dinner elsewhere.
