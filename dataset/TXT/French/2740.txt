0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g Could easily be one of the best restaurant i ever had in Las Vegas!!! This place is on par with Guy Savoy or Joel Robuchon. I ordered the tasting menu with the lobster supplement. It was 40 dollars extra but it was very well worth it!! Word cannot describe all my praise for this restaurant!! Please refers to my pictures for all the goodies!!! Definitely a must try!!
