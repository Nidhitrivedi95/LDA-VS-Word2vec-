_cjPEH9wXhKS-HQe_U3M4Q Le Select Bistro!  C'est le yum.

I had no idea that this place was here!  
Back in the day, the only reason I was out here was to go to C Lounge.
Well, it's been a damn long time since then, so I was surprised that there was this cute bistro here! 

Continuing our Yelp night out (and YAY for Jenn K.'s 200th review!) we found ourselves here.

The decor captures the essence of a French bistro.  Dim lighting, decor of dark wood, brass, and tiles.  The hipster waiters are friendly and attentive, but I prefer bistros with cute French waiters (*cough, Le Societe, cough*). =)

It's hard to resist a Prix Fixe menu... and steak frites for $20 bucks!
There are a few options available for the late night dinner.

For mains: Steak, duck confit, asparagus and Parmesan risotto...
Your choice of soup or salad or dessert.
Creme brule, please!

The steak is 5oz, so it's snack size.
My steak was slightly overcooked but still salty and good.
The fries were skinny and crispy.

I liked my meal here and I would come back here if I'm in the area, maybe. 
But there are other French Bistros that I prefer.
