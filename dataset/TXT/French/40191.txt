KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA Love this place when you need an escape. Great wine selection and great view! I love their salads and appetizers... Whenever I go back to visit mom we enjoy some quiet time here to catch up with each other. It's another side of local Las Vegas you don't get to see from the strip!
