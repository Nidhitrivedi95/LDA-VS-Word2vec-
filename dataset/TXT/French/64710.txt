teTQU7TIPE0O_B1zN_239w The breakfast selections are wonderful!  Not the same old bacon/ham/sausage and eggs! They even offer a very good turkey sausage.  Try the waffle combos.  The waffles are light and crispy.  The fresh fruit toppings are great. Eggs (your way) and sausage complete this very filling meal.  Average priced.
