5EIuCcoHY2evAhFMBV6G6g My friend and I came here on Christmas Day for their pre-fix Christmas menu, and it was our first time dining here.  We decided to each order something different from the courses so we could try more items.  I opted for three courses, while he chose four...

First course:
- "Lobster Bisque" (lobster medaillons, creme fraiche) - this was pretty good, the bisque itself was flavorful and not too thick.  There were small pieces of lobster, could have used more.
- "Warm white & green asparagus" (w/poached egg, truffle creme) - okay, asparagus was just like the name stated, warm.  I like my asparagus cooked so wasn't a fan of the crunchyness.  The poached egg was the best part of this dish.

Second course:
- "Seared Sea Scallops" (truffled orange braised endive, orange spice) - the scallops themselves were good, a nice flavor from the grill.  My friend loved this dish, and loved the orange marmalade-type stuff that came to compliment it.  I thought it was bitter and continued to eat the scallops minus orange stuff.

Main Course:
- "Black Cod" (artichoke barigoule, linguine tomato pasta, olive oil, lime) - this was the dish I chose.  Cod was seared and had a nice flavor to it, not over or under cooked.  Pasta was good, although it was your standard linguine.  I liked the taste the olive oil/lime sauce added to the dish.
- "Rib-eye steak" -  I think this is what my friend got, either this or filet...can't remember since I didn't try it because I don't eat land-roving animal (only fish/seafood).  Whatever it was he seemed to enjoy it and cleaned his plate. He said it was cooked just right.

Dessert:
- "Cheese selection" - I chose this one.  It came with 5 different types of cheeses (a bleu, goat, fontina, brie and can't remember what else), jam, tiny raisin toasts & walnuts.  The brie was my favorite, blue was typical. I didn't try the jam, not a huge fan, and the toasts were nothing too special.  The walnuts made a great compliment when eaten with the goat and brie.
- "Spiced Pumpkin Confit" (cinnamon-pumpkin ice cream, streusel) - this, I thought, was disgusting.  I can't remember exactly what I didn't like about it since I only tried one small bite, but I remember it being somewhat bitter and the flavors didn't go together.  He liked it.  Guys will eat anything.

As for wine I had a glass of pinot noir, as I do w/almost every dinner out, and it was good.  I cannot remember which one I had...

Our server was on top of our needs, although it seemed like quite a bit of time between courses.  She was somewhat cold and not overly friendly.  The restaurant itself has a nice feel to it, a somewhat romantic envirmonent and kind of old world, classic french design.  There are many little side rooms connected to the main dining room they were seating people in, or can be used as private dining rooms.  We were seated in one of those smaller side rooms & had it all to ourselves...it felt a little secluded & we were the only ones in there.

Overall, this was a good experience due to the food.  Prices are comparable, maybe a tad more, to Mon Ami Gabi & Comme Ca.  I have eaten at both and I still highly prefer Mon Ami, Comme Ca would be my second choice, and Pinot third.
