rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Some what disappointing experience overall considering the hype, but I do like this place.  I like their breakfast better than their dinner... and I love their bakery the best!  

I ordered the salmon baguette~ open face that you assemble on your own which I did like.

Their waffle and chicken was good, but I liked "hash a go go"s better.  Sorry Bouchon.  

Overall great service, casual atmosphere, and decent food.  I liked the convenience of it since we did stay at the Palazzo.  

Would I go back? Probably not unless it was out of convenience.  

ps.  When I did dine their for dinner...it was a so-so experience.  I think I'm too spoiled...so don't go just by my review, try it out yourself!
