E9HkUYYO_-5vKjvBwLuDIw Cute place in summerlin with decent prices. Great service, clean bathrooms (important after a long drive.) most importantly they were great with our baby/ toddler. Food was delicious and priced well.

Baguette and butter- good quality, delicious, hard to resist. 

Beef tar tar - strong mustard taste- but good

Baked goat cheese with pistachio and onion jam- so so so so so delicious. Like your plate clean delicious. 

Steak bavette - perfectly cooked at medium rare and thin crispy delicious fries. 

Side of zucchini - didn't expect much but was delicious.

Lamb- I am a bad judge of lamb since I'm general I am not a fan. Tasted like lamb which I personally don't like the taste of.
