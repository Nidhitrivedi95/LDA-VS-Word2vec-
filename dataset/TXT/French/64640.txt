Tefx_N6A6nrsdj4jHHnbYg Love this place.

There seems to be an influx of French bakeries ... this one is one of the better.   

Excellent coffee (don't accidentally walk in to the coffee shop next door - not the same place).

Excellent in-house made pastries.

VERY friendly staff.

Very clean kitchen and cafe.
