4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw j'adore mon ami gabi. i eat here every single time i'm in vegas and whether it's been sitting on the patio, or inside near the windows, it's been excellent. awesome location on the strip with a front row seat of the bellagio fountains. the french onion soup is very well done and the steak frites are magic! my favorites are the filet mignon merlot with butter and a red wine reduction, and the hanger steak with merlot butter. the restaurant is huge, but the service is always great. a consistent favorite over the years (and through the hangovers!)
