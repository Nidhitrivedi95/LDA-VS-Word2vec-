4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Arrived for breakfast at 9a, seated immediately, outside, it was a beautiful day, host very friendly, quick coffee service, French Toast with Blueberry Syrup was amazing great thickness but not too thick; not gooey but not dry; really awesome; My husband got the breakfast sandwich and a side of bacon; They were both fantastic also; If we return to Vegas we will definitely be going back for breakfast here!!!
