6Hj4AQ5DDGf7tsVk6LscLQ The food was great even though the owner didn't know what was in some of the dishes. I had to ask about the soup of the day, and other things rather then being told. For a "fine dinning" place it wasn't up to par. Even though the food was good I think this place was too expensive for what you get. 
Great for a first visit but not likely to go back.
