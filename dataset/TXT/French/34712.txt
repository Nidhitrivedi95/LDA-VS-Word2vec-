HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw Great food, Fun menu with something to please you no matter what you might be in the mood for.  Everything ordered was delicious that was ordered. Very very loud ambiance, would ask for a table near the window so you have a bit more privacy and can overlook the strip.  Fun and reasonably priced place to stop by when in Vegas!
