kGOr_D-LNpgZ2M9N8TT4QQ I love this place and I've only been once. I joined a Meetup here this evening and we started with a glass of champagne in the bar area (champagne Tuesdays, where you get a glass of Veuve and hors d'oeuvre for $12). It's a good size bar and also have a seafood/oyster bar. We then moved in to the restaurant for dinner and I was equally as impressed. The food was excellent, as was the wine and the service. There's is also a patio area, and as the restaurant is above the shops it must be a great place for people watching. Unfortunately, due to the good weather the patio was full, but staying in the restaurant was not a chore as it's lovely, very grand and nice decor. It's not that pricey considering the area and it was definitely worth it. I'll be back to this place soon.
