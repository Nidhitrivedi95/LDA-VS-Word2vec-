or4UVDjXEEjze3wNPjoAZA Reminiscing about my dinner at Zinc Bistro makes me feel all melty, like slipping into a hot bath... Very decadent. I had the onion soup - it's remarkable how when onion soup is not loaded with salt it actually tastes oniony! Followed it up with the duck confit. I preferred the sliced duck rather than the crispy duck, but both were delicious, and the risotta was out of this world. Do I want the souffle? Yes please! We had the chocolate with Grand Marnier sauce, and the kitchen pre-divided it before baking so we each had our own perfect portion.

Two small complaints:
1. Despite having a reservation, our party was seated in the crappiest table in the house - the booth next to the kitchen door. We were promptly moved as soon as we requested it, but the worst table in the house should never be given to a (extremely polite) party with reservations. Save it for your rude, self-important, entitled Real Housewives of Maricopa County walk-ins.
2. The butter for the bread was rock hard. That's one of my biggest restaurant pet peeves, and it irritates me even more when it happens at a restaurant of this calibre. I need full and equal butter distribution on my bread. One giant hard chunk in the middle, or a wad of bread shredded by trying to spread icy butter, is a total buzzkill. It's the little things, guys.
