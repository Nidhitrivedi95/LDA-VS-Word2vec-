AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw Have to say I'm slightly disappointed. The Nutella crepe was just ok, too much sugar. The brioche was good. The almond croissant was ok. Overall, I actually much prefer bakeries I've had in Santa Barbara. A disappointment, and not worth it's own trek down the strip to get here.
