P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ Wow! My wife and I 'invested' in this place (quite pricey)... but it was so worth it. This was an experience we won't soon forget. We had a 10 course meal which made the rest of the meals we had in Vegas pale in comparison. This by far is on the top 3 places I have ever had the pleasure dining at. Although I typically like enjoy a great meal with more of a social vibe, it was nice to have the solitude with my wife, where we were able to focus on each other... and the amazing meal! It's worth saving up for. Enjoy!
