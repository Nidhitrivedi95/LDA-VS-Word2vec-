Our service was less than expected, glasses never filled and we felt rushed to turn over the table. They also had security walking around and staring at dinners, which made the entire experience feel very uncomfortable. If you are looking for excellent French Cuisine and dining experience then I would recommend Le Cirque, especially if you are looking for a romantic dining experience.
