Bread came at abot15minutesand we finally saw a waiter after almost 20 minutes but he was waiting on the table next to us and they were seated well after us. When the waiter got around to us he was complaining that the kitchen was all screwed up and they did not have enough wait. He didn't apologize, buthedid say it would be awhile before we saw our food  the next time we saw him was when he dropped off our check and he asked if my steak had been cooked properly. I said that it was a little under done and his response was that he had been getting complaintsthatthesteaks were overdone. Skip the place. The food is not worth the headache.
