aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw I went to Vegas for a week and for the six days that I stayed there, this bakery was always closed! (I should've looked at their business hours) Luckily I was able to catch them when they were opened. I bought a box of macarons and they were delicious. Probably the best macarons I've had. They were big, crunchy, and chewy. I enjoyed every bite of it. They even have chocolate covered macarons! Of course I couldn't resist that, so I got a raspberry chocolate covered macaron. I highly recommend that when you come visit this bakery. There were other flavors like vanilla and caramel for the chocolate covered macarons. I wish I tried their other pastries though.

I definitely recommend this place when you visit Vegas! It's a really small bakery though and could easily be missed.
