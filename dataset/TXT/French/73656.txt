xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g The Eiffel Tower Restaurant, it was a thing of beauty when it was in it's prime. I believed it was a world-class restaurant; what emerged later into the night was by far the worst experience I ever had at a restaurant!

I've been coming here since 2007 and I've never had an issue until my recent venture. The scenery was almost worth the trip a few flights above the main strip. On the elevator ride, a person could easily experience vertigo if he or she intended to.

The reconfirmation phone call seemed like there was an issue with my reservation; when I called, the women that answered seemed immensely rude! WTH, why treat a customer like that? Our server was fairly courteous and our drinks were adequate. However, he seemed like he was rushing us since we did not order dessert...DESSERT!!! I also got sick after eating here; a first in Vegas for me! 

Also, I don't want to get into the explicit details of my abysmal evening. However, I'm hoping the owner will contact me soon. 

I don't believe I'll be returning and I can't recommend anyone venturing this place anymore. If you want to pay a lot of money for terrible food and service, then come here...
