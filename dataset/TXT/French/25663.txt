Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA Really fabulous dinner in a fabulous location.  Ask to sit on the balcony overlooking the strip - it was a great way to make the night memorable.

All of the dishes were very well-prepared.  Match the duck fois gras, which was brought in from France and then laid in date puree, with a glass of Sauternes for the perfect wine pairing.   The Gnocchi was delicate, fluffly, and almost chewy a great choice. The spicy crab and tuna tartare were good alternatives for starters as well.

For dinner, I had the dry aged rib eye and it was soo tender.  It comes with sauces, bordelaise or many others - but i didnt use them - no need.  The Beef cheeks (waygu) were slow braised in a rich wines sauce that was dark and complex - really delicious but very rich.   And the lobster in the curry sauce was a unique and fabulous version of a Sauce American.
