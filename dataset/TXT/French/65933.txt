"A Manhattan is stirred," I said to the waiter, who looked as though he had never tried one. He kindly replaced it. The salad began with good, fresh ingredients--heirloom cherry tomatoes, arugula,  and burrata--but the thing was drenched in cooked, pickled purple onions: the taste of the pickling brine lingers on my palate 12 hours later. The entree is my new standard for ill advised combinations,  replacing peanut butter and tuna: salmon and broccoli. I can just hear someone proclaiming "let's combine only HEALTHY ingredients." I don't think the chef eats his own cooking. This odd combination came in a broth into which were dipped halved fingerling potatoes. I was worried about them being mushy, but they were cooked so hard that they were impermeable. The whole mess was inedible.
