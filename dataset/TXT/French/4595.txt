2lCjKqGK2s4FrJVPjJK1fg One of my favourite coffee shops around the area. Cafe Jules has a Parisian vibe and it's been recently renovated! 

The owner is soo so nice! He's always so happy and so friendly and greets every customer with lots of enthusiasm. He MAKES Cafe Jules even awesomer!

Love their coffee and pastries. 
I usually get their apricot danish, altho on occasion have also tried the raspberry tart and an almond croissant. All are fresh and just the right amount of sweetness and flakiness. 
They also have a wide variety of different teas if you're not much of a coffee drinker.

All around the coffee shop, there's art hanging on the walls - which are for sale if you fancy buying one.
