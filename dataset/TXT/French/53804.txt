qmh6zxtJ8C8-YiUPv7ySlw Tasty tuna tartare appetizer, but in my neverending quest for great steak frites, this was just average.  The actual steak was surprisingly tough even though I ordered it medium.  The service was great and the staff was fantastic to our bachelorette party.  The menu had a wide selection of entrees so there was plenty to choose from...  But honestly, what is up with the giant singing frog outside of the restaurant?
