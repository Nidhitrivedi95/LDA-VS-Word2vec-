5fquJHY2hMX9tPRD5s0t5g Rooster's food is average. I've been a couple of times and both experiences were unremarkable. I don't generally bother writing restaurant reviews, but upon recently learning that Jim Noble--the owner of Rooster's--actively supports the far-right, discriminatory group Alliance Defending Freedom, I felt I couldn't remain silent. Guess what? You have the freedom to spend your money at any variety of restaurants in Charlotte that have better food and are owned by decent humans who operate their businesses ethically. If you care about not supporting a bigot, then there are plenty of other wonderful restaurants to patronize. I'll never set foot in another Jim Noble establishment* again.
