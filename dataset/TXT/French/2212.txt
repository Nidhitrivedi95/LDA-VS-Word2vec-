0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g Was surprised by a dinner at Picasso for my anniversary. It was tied for the best meal I've had in Vegas (hard to compare it E, which is such a different experience). 

Highlights:

-Amuse bouche: a bamboo skewer with 1/2 of a hard-boiled quail egg, smoked salmon (spritzed with lemon), and caviar. Simple, but perfectly balanced and the best amuse I've had in a long time.

- Scallop: beautiful sear on a bed of pomme puree with a demi-glace reduction, with a length-wise section potato chip for texture. I also had some bacon bread with this-- which has inspired me to bake some at home!

-Foie Gras: Usually I prefer a torchon with brioche, but this was the best seared piece I have ever had. Here the technique was just amazing: an perfect sear on both sides-- the inside was like butter. The pistachio garnish added texture and brought out the nutty qualities of the Sauternes for the pairing.

-Lamb:Best lamb I've ever had. Apparently it's organic and sourced from Colorado, from a farm that tries to raise them in a Wagyu type of fashion. It was so incredibly tender that I was sure they sous-vided it, but the waiter claimed it was roasted. It was served with a rosemary infused demi-glace reduction and an elegant take on ratatouille. Ordered it rare instead of the suggested med-rare, and was glad I did. Syrah aged in American oak made for a nice pairing.

-Dessert: The standout of the plate was the Guiness ice cream.

The service was excellent as well. (There was a goofy moment when we asked if there were any additional pairings not listed on the menu and the waiter told us that "the wine gets progressively heavier to match the food" lol, I should hope so! And one waiter seemed particularly enamored with asking "can I get you anything else," which is a bit odd when repeated and in the context of a tasting menu. What are we going to do, ask for ketchup?  )

I appreciated that we weren't rushed in the slightest, despite having one of the nice two-tops right by the window. We were at the restaurant for over 3.5 hours, in part because we started with champagne before the dinner.

I really liked how they kept the restaurant decor simple except for the dazzling Picassos, and the beautiful multi-colored informal flowers on the center stand, which played off of the bright colors in the paintings.

I thought that the dinner was also a good value. There were many expensive ingredients, and dinner came to ~600 for two (though we spent around 200 on beverages). This makes it the best value tasting menu I've ever had, and one of my all-time favorite meals.
