The Experience: [August 2016]
Afternoon snack time? Oh yes! I'm glad this little pastry shop was open this late in the afternoon. That being said, their selection probably wasn't as plentiful as it would be in the morning, but I still was able to go some macarons and the special of the day pastry (totally forgot the name of it).

Parking can be a little strange and tight in the area (that's coming from an out-of-towner), but it can be found within a reasonable walking distance. I think I looped around a bit, but I found something eventually.

I love pastries, so I'd recommend coming here earlier in the day (like the morning) to get the best selection. Cute neighborhood shop :)
