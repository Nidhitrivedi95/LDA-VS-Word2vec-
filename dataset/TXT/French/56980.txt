rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Came here for brunch with my girlfriends (we're all in our early 30's). 
We had reservations and were seated promptly.
Their coffee is good. The pastries are delicious (you can get the same pastries at their stand in the Venetian). I loved the strawberry croissant. 
I had the Bouchon French toast -it was good but I was not overly impressed. 
The Oeuf & Boudin Blanc was pretty tasty though.
Next time, I'll have to try the Chicken and Waffles.
