aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw I have been dying to make a stop at Bouchon bakery, one of five locations by the renowned Chef Thomas Keller. This was checked off my wish list today! The PALM SIZED macarons were yummy and had the perfect consistency! The raspberry and caramel macarons were delightfully delicious and for coffee lovers, the coffee macaron was on the strong side, but I love my coffee black so I was a huge fan of it!

This cute little shop in the Venetian also has coffee, wraps, salads, muffins, and cinnamon rolls available. I'll be back for seconds on macarons and to try the cinnamon roll!
