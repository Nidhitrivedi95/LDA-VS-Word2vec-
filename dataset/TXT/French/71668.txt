Jonathan the mixologist made a great recommendation after we had a horrible experience at a place a few doors down. He was outstanding and very personable. He gave us the basic options then enthusiastically asked if we wanted to "go wild"... we couldn't turn down the opportunity. What we got was the appropriately named "Jonathan special". 
Our "wild Jonathan special" included two difference cheeses with ham, bacon lardons, and red peppers. I still drool when thinking about it. If you're ever traveling in Phoenix airport terminal C, definitely go to Zinc and get wild!
