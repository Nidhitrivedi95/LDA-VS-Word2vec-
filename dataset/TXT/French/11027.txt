4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I love this place. Although extremely crowded, I prefer an atmosphere with a lot of people as apposed to none. The place looks very fancy but there is also a casual presence to it. The outside seating provides an amazing view of the Bellagio fountains that cannot be matched. I had a pasta from here the last time I went, and I have yet to stop raving about it. It was the best pasta I have ever eaten in my life. Never have I tasted something so scrumptious and such a genuine flavor that I have never tasted before. The servers are always very effective and helpful. Even with the extreme amount of people, the service is grade A. I was amazed with my experience here.
