OkC86YtZ0Nm19my5F4GGrQ Beautiful little find in Rocky River!  The hot, humid weather took us past the patio dining and inside the restaurant.  As lovely as it was from the outside, it was charming on the inside.  Kind of like walking into a little place in Paris....which means they've achieved their goal!  The red-painted pressed tin-ceiling, beautiful old wood floors, antiques, and the big paintings of the Eiffel Tower create the mood.  Enough about the setting....on to the food!

Potato and chive soup was the special soup of the day.  I ordered that and the crab ceviche.  Wonderful combination!  This wasn't any thick, floury, pasty potato soup....it was light, delicate, redolent of sweet cream and delicately seasoned.  It was honestly the best potato soup I've ever had.  The crab ceviche was actually an appetizer - I wanted something light after soup.  This beautiful plate was composed of a fan of perfectly ripe avocado topped with a lightly dressed mound of sweet, fresh, crab claw meat, drizzled with a red pepper aioli that had a little bit of appreciated kick!  Another drizzle of mango puree was a nice counterpoint - a little citrusy, a little sweet - against all the other flavors.  Divine.  On to dessert!

My perennial chocolate craving was perfectly satisfied with this tiny, moist chocolate cake, drizzled with peanut butter caramel and surrounded by a lovely sea salt.  Again, just a perfect balance.  

Very nice wine list, too!
