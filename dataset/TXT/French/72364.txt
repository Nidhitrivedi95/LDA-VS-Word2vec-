XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q Dear Mr. Joël Robuchon,

Thank you for the most memorable & luxurious dining experience in my 20ish years of existence. I can not EVEN begin to describe the night without smiling. Even though a 3-Star Michellin award rating far surpasses my 5-star woohoo, you still deserve all the stars in the world because of the once-in-a-lifetime experience you've given me...

A quick break-down:
1. Complimentary limo pick-up to/from our hotel
2. Entering the "Mansion" from a private entrance
3. Hostess waiting to greet us as we arrived
4. Walking inside the Mansion villas and private quarters
5. Hostess giving us a mini tour as we entered into the restaurant
6. Restaurant decor & ambiance
7. SUPERB service; explaining each course from beginning to end
8. AMAZING & LUXURIOUS food (we ordered the 16-course meal)
9. Lavish dessert cart
10. Unforgettable 4-hour dining experience

I'm still awestruck about this place. A 4-hour dining experience, a 16-course meal p/person... you can't get anything like this anywhere else! We definitely had to pace ourselves and savor every dish; taking small breaks, & helpings of coffee & whiskey :)

This was an amazing experience for me & my +1.

Thank you,
Rosie
