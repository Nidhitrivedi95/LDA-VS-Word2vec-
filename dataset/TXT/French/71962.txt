XI3iNUgChOfJk5ppjKVEQQ By far the best steak my husband and I have ever had. And I should mention we've eaten at quite a few steak houses, my husband has even been to a high end steakhouse in Calgary. It beats them all, and it's a better price per oz than you'd pay at a typical Keg. Been here 2 times now, first time was the night my husband proposed 1.5 years ago, second time was on our honeymoon when we spent part in Montreal. We always get the 31oz ribeye steak. I dream of it when I'm home in Halifax. The local cheese board never disappoints, either.
It's a small space, cozy, warm and inviting atmosphere. The service is among the best we've ever had, from the greeter to the servers, all friendly, polite and willing to answer any and all questions we had. We will absolutely be back again and would highly recommend Barroco to anyone wanting great food in Montreal!
