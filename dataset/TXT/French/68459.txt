vLkKorA1gPS97Zj0_WKA0Q Awful and pretentious. This place kicked my friend and I out of the restaurant because one of us was wearing shorts - during Defcon/Blackhat week. The lady asked us first if we were guests of the hotel (apparently it's OK for them) then told us 'we have a very strict dress code policy and I am afraid you cannot have dinner here.' I checked all websites in advance for dress code and none listed any. The manager stood there clueless and careless as we left.
