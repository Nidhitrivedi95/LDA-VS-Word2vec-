YUFxSG6idHePsxOmnSHtpQ Chose Mimi's Café to handle my parents' 60th wedding anniversary party for our family, mostly because I knew that there would be something on the menu for everyone to enjoy.  I was SOOOOO pleased!  We had a private room and the management was incredibly accommodating!  The service was beyond outstanding, and my parents were overjoyed!  MANY thanks to Mimi's Café for making this event a HUGE success for us.  We're forever grateful!!
