UpEVdq_euH-5mqCIgUAd2Q Summary: good for value, OK food, good service, good environment
Price: $35/person
What I don't like: on the menu, it asks for at least 18% gratitude. That is too forceful.

Went here for summerlicious, 28 for 3 course meal, good for price, but standard food.
OK starter, ok main course, bad dessert.
The smoke salmon is just average. The lamb shank is big portion, but the sauce is good. The dessert tastes like costco cake.
It is good for summerlicous, but Toronto has better summerlicious restaurants. I would probably not go here for regular price.
