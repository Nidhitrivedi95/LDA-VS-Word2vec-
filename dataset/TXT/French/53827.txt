qnFdBp12seAxwe2_iHM2bA Always on the never ending quest for an exemplary  dining experience as I travel the world and this evening I found yet another one at Laloux! After a brisk mile + stroll through some wonderful Montréal neighborhoods I found my destination.

Pleasant dinning room all the buzz for a Thursday evening as I arrived around sunset. Menu is very well presented with even a set experience which I passed on for a combination of dishes which I had high expectations for!!

Starting with the delectable Sunchoke soup and smoked salmon, marinated pearl onions, sunflower oil and seeds conditioned the pallets for what was to come. 

Next the main coarse which was an beautifully presented Gaspésie arctic char complimented w whelks (sea snails), roasted tomatoe, fiddleheads, crustacean bisque, marinated sea lettuce and cucumber. The flavors caused my taste buds to be drenched in flavor hitting high notes with ever delicious bite!

After a smooth palette cleanse of an Old Fashioned à l'érable - Canadian Maple Whiskey, crab apple and ginger bitter topped w an orange wedge really prepared me for the last foray of the evening.
 
Gorgeous desert presentation... mid size Lemon Tart, dabbled w tiny crisp rosemary meringue kisses, sprinkled candied citrus puree, inviting grapefruit squares and sprinkled w pink peppercorn sorbet....WOW! Brilliant and C'est Magnifique!!  

Needless to say I floated on the wonderful Montréal summer air as I strolled back to my hotel fully satisfied after a wonderful trip to an amazing city!  Thank you!!
