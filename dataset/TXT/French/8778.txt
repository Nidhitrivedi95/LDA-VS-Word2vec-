4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Had a decent experience here.  Made a reservation and was seated within about 10 minutes.  Had a pretty nice seat, inside, but against the glass wall over looking the strip.  Was seated at one of those tables for two that are weirdly small and low to ground.  Really uncomfortable to sit at.  Food was ok.  Onion soup was great except for it's zero salt content  I salted it and it fixed it.  My wife enjoyed the snails.  My steak flavorful but the fry/chip/things that came with it were odd and hard to eat with any enjoyment.  My wife had the scallop appetizer for her entree and it was a complete rip off.  It was ONE scallop sliced into three to look like 3 scallops with some cheese and sauce.  Our waiter was really creepy and possibly condescending at the same time.  And no, it wasn't because we complained at all, it just how he was ::shiver::
