XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q Service: Moment you walk in, not only are you awed by the unique taste of interior designing, there's a wonderful host that seats you to a wonderful decorated table and immediately greeted by a gentle, kind and helpful server.  There to answer every question and help pair wine for the selected course.  It was utterly amazing.

Food: My course had Foie Gras dancing on my taste buds.  Dont get me wrong, I LOVE foie gras.  Each course had such unique flavor, taste, texture....it was mind blowing.  I'm loss for words how amazing the taste and texture was, and the wine, just pure exquisite.

Ambiance: I can't describe the interior...not sure how to put it into words...it's really unique.

Parking: Again, since it's vegas, I got to brag...drove in with the brand new Corvette Stingray
