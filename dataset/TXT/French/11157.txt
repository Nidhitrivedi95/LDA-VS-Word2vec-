4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Pros: Great view of the Bellagio Fountains (right across the street), ample seating. Decent food.

Cons: Food could have been better considering the price. Likewise for the service. I've had much better steaks for less. 

Overall: Worth doing if you're in the area and wanting some decent food without worrying about a dress code. We had no problem getting a table at 6pm on a Monday, but on weekends you would want to get a reservation (easy to do online)
