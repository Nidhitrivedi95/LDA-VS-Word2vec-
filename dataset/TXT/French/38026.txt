JEXasd9XUHFbt_fIdmdK8g Truly exceptional dining experience, atmosphere, service, and food quality/presentation. My dear friend and I thoroughly enjoyed our evening at La Banane. The decor in stunning, the staff are pleasant, attentive - but not overly so, and very accommodating. We ordered the shrimp cocktail, omelette, duck, and the outrageously gorgeous and delicious Ziggy Stardust Disco Egg for dessert. Zero complaints. Every single bite was delicious. Will definitely be going back.
