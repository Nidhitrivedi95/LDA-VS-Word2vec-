HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw Modern French cuisine? Not sure what that entails, but there's a burger on the menu. Unfortunately it was not called a Royale with Cheese.

Food here wasn't that special. Duck confit was actually my favorite, and that was an appetizer. Everything else was just average.

Not sure if Yelp had it, but when I checked into foursquare, I got a free dessert with any entree purchase.

Service was very good, although I felt bad because I was being served by a pregnant lady.
