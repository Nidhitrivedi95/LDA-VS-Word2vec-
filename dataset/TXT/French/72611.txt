XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q Wish I wasn't sick on my visit here. I was struggling to figure out what was going on, but I didn't want to miss out on this opportunity and I'm glad I still came by.

I knew I wasn't going to finish the degustation menu, but I figured going for the 5 course would be sufficient. 

My favorite was the black truffle spaghetti. It's like a $55 supplement, but damn...it was worth it. Nice rich sauce too.

And the bread and desserts are pretty damn good too. I would probably just come back, hang out in the lounge and just order dessert from their dessert cart.

If it wasn't for my sickness, I would have gone all out for the degustation menu. But I'll definitely be back to go for it in round two.
