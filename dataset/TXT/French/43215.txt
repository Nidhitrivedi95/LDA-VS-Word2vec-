lQ9VmIWvM6v-rONPkYX8aQ My husband and I have eaten here twice.  The first experience, while the food was excellent was marred by some obnoxious dinner guests seated on the backside of us who were talking extremely loud and at one point arguing in another language (which I could understand but didn't make it better).    Because of them they pretty much brought our experience down considerably, but we thought this time around (2 years later) we would give Alex a try again...and boy were we glad.  We were staying at the Wynn so it was even better having such a long indulgent meal such a short distance from our room.  

My husband and I decided to do the $185 tasting menu.  First they presented us with an amuse bouche containing about 5 items which I can't remember but totally enjoyed.  The tasting then contained the following:

-Matsutake Mushroom and Tapioca Cream with Spanish Caviar and Fresh Sudachi 
-Crispy Carabinieri Prawn with Cauliflower, Savory Custard, Vadouvan Curry and Carrot Ginger Sauce 
-Sauté of Sonoma Foie Gras with Sweet Potato, Caramelized Onions, Black Truffles and Butternut Squash Sauce 
-Brioche Crusted Spanish Mackerel with Orange Braised Endive, Roasted Salsify and Citrus Red Wine Sauce 
-Roasted Squab with Brussels Sprouts, Celery Root Purée, Wild Huckleberries and Herb Vinegar Sauce 
-Sour Cream Semifreddo with Spiced Cranberry
-Vanilla Butter Poached Apple Cream Puff with Maple Ice Cream

You'd think that was the end, but it wasn't.  After dessert they presented us with a small plate full of lemon madelines and another small plate of petite fours.  Oh lord I told the waiter he would have to roll us up the stairs and out of the restaurant soon.  With that queue, he saved a special dessert cake for us to take home (aka our room) instead of yet indulging in another dessert.  Then as we exited the restaurant the hostess opened the door for us and said she had a last little treat for us to take home...a little box of mini french macaroons.  

Oh Alex, you have moved up the ranks so much in our book...you may have to make Le Cirque share the spot of "top Vegas restaurant" in our hearts.
