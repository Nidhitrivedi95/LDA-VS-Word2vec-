4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Visited early August 2016. 
We came for breakfast with the $20 coupon from the Lettuce Entertain You coupon book, had no problems using it. I got a blueberry parfait (servicable but nothing to write home about) and my friend got a three-egg breakfast plate. She absolutely loved her plate, and there was enough to share. The thick-cut, perfectly cooked bacon forever raised my standards for what constitutes good bacon! 
The staff were great-- we needed about 10 refills on our coffee and they were quick and attentive. The view was very nice: we could see the Bellagio fountains but there wasn't really much going on that early in the morning. 
Overall it was a very good experience!
