RYih1E4SFptthlWbcupm2g I was here about 2 Saturday's ago alone as I was looking around for a restaurant to eat.  The only French restaurant I have ever eaten in Edinburgh is La Garrigue.  The chef, waitress & manager were all French which I thought was a good sign.  I was expecting the same quality but unfortunately I was wrong.  The managers and waitress were all very polite and well mannered.  It is unfortunate that the food quality was just mediocre and average.  I mistakenly chose a 3 course set meal for dinner as opposed to lunch but the manager was very kind and talked to the kitchen staff and they were willing to prepare the dinner set for me.  I am unsure if the limited time to get ready the dinner food before dinner actually affected the quality of the food.  If that was the case then they should have said no to me ordering the dinner during lunch.  I had Baked scallops served à la Provençale as the starter.  The scallops were fresh and delicately prepared but the roasted peppers that came with it tasted like they were from the jars.  I had Duck legs with ratatouille, roast garlic and tapenade sauce as the main.  The duck was a bit tough for a leg dark meat and seems like they were deep fried from as opposed to properly prepared French style.  The worst was actually the desert.  The Creme Brulee tasted like a thick custard and not a proper Creme Brulee.  I judge French food by their Creme Brulee but this not Creme Brulee so it felt like I actually have nothing French to judge in this restaurant.  I have been to France for food and yes, the chef is French but quality is really not up to French scratch.  A bit of a let down.  The only pro is that the waitress & manager were very nice to me.  But I eat in a restaurant for the food, not really the service.  Once is enough I think.
