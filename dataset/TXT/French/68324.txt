vg55SAkrEmuHpWfIMtJjBQ Legume is the absolute best restaurant in Western Pennsylvania. I dare anyone to prove me wrong :-)

Eclectic, unpretentious, and downright wholesome, Legume always serves up the freshest dishes.

I frequent the restaurant at least once per month. During this trip, I had a platter of their pates (including lamb, head cheese, pork terrine); which was so good it was indecent. I followed it up with the crispy pork belly and greens salad (also insanely delicious); then pineapple pound cake for dessert. 

Every single bite tasted like heaven and I had to restrain myself from turning the lovely evening into food porn. :-)
