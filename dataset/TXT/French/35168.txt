hQRzxCiSJ4OBHVwQgJecsA Honestly, this place was ok. On a scale from "burn it with fire!" to "Woo-Hoo!l, it scored a "yumm!".

The person who sat us was creepy and spoke such accented French that I had trouble understanding him.

Our waitress was great. She was attentive and knowledgable, but she just wasn't around enough. It felt like an French bistro, where you have to signal your server for attention. Not what I expected in Ste-Adèle. 

The food was good. Local, organic, this- and that- free. My partner had a pouting with chèvre and merguez, and I had the steak frites du jour. The pouting was good, and the steak was perfectly cooked to my requested medium. However, I found that there was too much "going on" on my plate, between the steak, frites, veggies, beet purée AND gravy. The flavours all kind of melded and nothing shone. Which is a shame because the steak really should have been the star of that plate.

The desert is what made it a "yum" and not a "meh". We each had the crème brûlée with the side shooter. It was delicious. Exactly the way a crème brûlée should be. It came with fruit, which was promptly ignored.

As soon as this place learns to ignore the fancy bullshit and focus on the flavours, it'll be awesome.

If we're ever in Ste-Adèle, we might go back, but it's not worth a drive from Montréal or Tremblant.
