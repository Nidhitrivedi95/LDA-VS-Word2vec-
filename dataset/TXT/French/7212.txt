4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw While the portions  served doesn't  equate  the amount you pay,  the food is descent,  good service.  Located in a picturesque  part of the Las Vegas  Strip,  in Paris.  The view is good,  the place was packed.  Waiter  was very nice.  One complain  I have regards to the toast that came with my food.  They were hard.  And I hated  that.  The bread given  before  ordering  is a very good touch.  We ordered from the breakfast  menu which was good since vee were there for brunch  time.
