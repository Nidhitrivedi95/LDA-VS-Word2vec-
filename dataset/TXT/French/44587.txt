mnn--vaYHtNyBNYFYBFIog C'était délicieux! Montreal gives NYC a run for its money in fine dining. My friends and I were on vacation in Montreal, so we decided to treat ourselves to one meal at one high end restaurant. We came for lunch on 5/4/17. My friend Fiona chose this restaurant, and it did not disappoint. Our server was excellent. The bread & butter starter was wonderful. We each had the prix-fixe lunch menu - appetizer, main, dessert and coffee. My starter was the excellent confit arctic char and my main halibut was cooked perfectly. The others at my table ordered the duck magret and braised lamb shank. For dessert, we had the chocolate and miso tartlet and the pink pepper meringue and gel. I liked both desserts but one of my friends wasn't so fond of the miso tartlet. Perhaps too much miso.  Clientele were business suits, so we felt a little out of place. Merci beaucoup!
