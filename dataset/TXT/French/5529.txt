3jKUbhGSjFTv5jZ0wnW0xA We visited Les Deux Gamins with a large group (18 people) for whom we had allowed them to choose a restricted menu. They were able to seat us and even to give us a designated room, which was great. Unfortunately we were seated in an awkward "L" shape. If we went again we would ask for a group of tables in a designated space. 

First, I should say that this place can offer a very nice set of choices for a large group at a very reasonable price. I'd like to go back and try the full menu, especially since at this price point it's easy to do.

For the vegetarian in our group (a sad thing to be when French food is involved, but it happens!) they weren't able to offer him anything other than gratineed zucchini, which he found too rich to eat much of, and roasted vegetables, which he said were good, but it's too bad they didn't really have a vegetarian meal (with protein of some sort) to offer. 

I had the green salad (which I regretted because my entree came with more of the same salad - should have gone for the soup, which was apparently very good) and the duck confit. This was disappointing for me as one of my favourite parts of duck confit is the nice, crispy skin, which this did not have. Instead the skin was gelatinous and so I sadly pushed it aside. The duck underneath was still delicious, though (how could it not be?) and the potatoes were outlandishly buttery and therefore quite good. For dessert I had the creme brulee, which was good but not freshly torched for the full crispy and warm on top, cool and creamy underneath experience, which always makes me a little sad.

If you only had one dinner in Montreal this isn't what I would recommend but for the money, this is a good little restaurant. Nothing outstanding but you definitely won't regret a visit.
