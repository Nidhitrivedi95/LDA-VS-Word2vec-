USleI8g1UVN9-9jm-b4uIg Our experience at Fig Tree was absolutely amazing. Could not have been better in any way. We moved to Charlotte on May 8th and our anniversary was May 12th, so not a whole lot of time to figure out the best place to go for our celebration. We asked around and narrowed it down to 3 places and went with our gut, which was Fig Tree....the outdoor patio. It was raining that night, so the setting was especially romantic. The food was just perfect...I sound like I am just gushing but it was! From appetizers and drinks all the way to dessert, we could not have been happier. And, as if all of that weren't enough, we had probably the best waiter we've ever encountered (and we've been to a lot of restaurants in our 40+ years!). Kurt was a pro....knowledgeable, kind, funny and attentive. He even sent us a thank you card following our visit...incredible! We cannot wait to return to this fine restaurant. If you are deliberating between places, for a special occasion as we were....search no further!
