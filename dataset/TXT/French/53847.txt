qnFdBp12seAxwe2_iHM2bA I went there for 'Taste MTL' week. Of the available menu, I had the seared trout, the beef tartar, and the profiteroles. I wish there had been more of the seared trout, as it was DELICIOUS. The beef tartar was quite good, but it included beets, which was a bit of a downer for me. And of course, the dessert was magical!
Great wine selection, and the waitress was really friendly and extremely patient with my friend who tasted about 4 different wines before he finally settled.
