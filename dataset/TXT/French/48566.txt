ohMpNug5zWNxOlL6ShG7Ig I love a restaurant that has unique choices and caters to the customers palate. I had a delightful meal of sautéed brussel sprouts with bacon, french onion soup and profiteroles. This is a nicely appointed small restaurant with outdoor seating, first class wines, designer beers and multiple alcohol choices. The service is first class with knowledgeable, professional, personable staff that strives to make your experience memorable. The flavors are fresh and delightful. Thank you for the experience! I will be back to try the rest of the menu.
