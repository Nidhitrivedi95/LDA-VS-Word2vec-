4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw 3.8. I'm a little indifferent about Mon Ami Gabi. 

I've been here twice. Once for lunch, and another for dinner. 

Lunch: Sat outdoors. Great view of the strip, enjoyed the nice weather and crazy "Las Vegans". The Egg Benedict was delicious, so I wouldn't recommend coming here to cure your hangover. Enjoy your lunch. 

Dinner: I came here about a month ago, and sat indoors. It's a little bit more intimate, however, the service was definitely not up to PAR this time around. The waitress kept cutting us off...uhmm.... RUDE!!! I say, if we want to order a la carte, let us!!! 

Escargot: must try. 
Raw Oysters: yum yum, slurp slurp. 
Filet Mignon: I ordered medium rare, but it came out medium. Still good. 
Frites: I prefer Mcdonald's french fries. 

Food was great. Service could improve.
