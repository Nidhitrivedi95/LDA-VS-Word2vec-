RZk_PE-H9SygqwSQd88cWQ We were the first two customers in Le Grand Compoir Restaurant on this Friday evening around 6:30pm in a busy area of Montreal. We called around earlier to several 5 star French Restaurants but they were all booked solid. Initially we felt lucky to have found this place that wasn't busy at all.

My wife ordered the special which was Osso Bucco (Pork with gravy), broccoli, salad and a bowl of vegetable soup (actually looked and tasted like split pea). The Osso Bucco was good but not outstanding. The broccoli was steamed perfectly but lacked favor.

I had the Salmon which came with diced tomatoes and basil on top. The rest of the dish came with broccoli, rice and also with the same vegetable soup. All the food was served hot. But I found the way the Salmon was prepared just didn't work. While the Salmon was hot and moist, putting cold diced tomatoes and basil on top did nothing to enhance the taste. The rice also lacked taste and really didn't go with Salmon. Again the broccoli for me also lacked taste.

We also had the house Merlot wine. Here again, it just wasn't that good.

The service was excellent.
