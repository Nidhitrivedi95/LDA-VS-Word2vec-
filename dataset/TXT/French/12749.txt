4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I used to love this place- my husband and I have been to Mon Ami Gabi a few times before but won't be returning after tonight. The food quality has gone down and the service tonight was pretty bad. Our server was not at all friendly and only stopped by twice. Our food had cold French fries that were hard to chew so we asked for fresh ones...and the fries and French bread were the best part of the meal. My chicken was flavorless and dry (I could buy better roasted chicken at the store) and my mushrooms were sautéed so much they were burnt black. My husband could have bought a better burger somewhere else (He said Carl's Jr would have been better). They need new management and a new chef. :(
