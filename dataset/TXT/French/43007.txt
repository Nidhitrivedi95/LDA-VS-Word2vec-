LQ_gYNs5E10IGFE0NOyD7A Met friends for drinks and dinner.   Love the decor of the place.

My friends were glowing about the food.  I didn't like sitting out back on the patio at night since it is so poorly lit.  There was one string of christmas lights barely draped over a corner of the very long table seating about 10 people.  When they brought the food and said what was in each bowl, I guess I had to take their word because I couldn't see anything.. not appealing to me.  Would be fine to sit out there at night for drinks or during daylight.... or after they hire a lighting designer to make it more appealing. 

Drinks and service were outstanding.
