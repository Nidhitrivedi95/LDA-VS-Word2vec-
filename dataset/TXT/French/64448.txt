tCSlpwJQ4CZsUEMZeH2SFg Came here first on a Thursday morning around 11 am, and was surprised of nice interior. I was expecting a small little café that served sandwiches and coffee, and was surprised of how deep the restaurant is. 
I ordered a cup of Earl Grey, the Parisienne Omelette, and my husband ordered the Eggs Benedict and a shared order of crepes with maple. 
The Omelette was very good stuffed with brie cheese, and came with toast with jam and butter, a hashbrown soufflé thing. My husbands meal looked very rich with hollandaise and running yolk- something I wouldn't enjoy. The crepes were nothing to write home about, I can make them better, and the maple wasn't maple, it was aunt jemima crap. Thank goodness we had a groupon, I didn't look at bill, but after my second visit when I paid the bill I realized what a rip off this place can be.
Second Time, 11 am on Sunday, seated right away, I went with two clients and brought my toddler son with me. I had the Earl Grey, and Endive Salad with added chicken, blue cheese, and apple. They ordered Florentine Omelette which was similar to my Parisienne omelette I ordered before, and the pate which I tried and did not like (kinda dog food like) , granted I didn't know what to expect, bc it is nothing like foie gras! My son had a kids meal grilled cheese and ham on croissant with pomme frites, and for 6 bucks it was plentiful and delicious!! They ordered mimosas, tea and café au laite. The bill came to 71 for breakfast and it was my treat.. So of course I was a little salty that my tea was close to 4 dollars for steamed water and a tea bag! My salad was expensive as it was and since I added chicken I think it tacked on another 6 bucks(another kids meal) and there def wasn't enough chicken to equal 6 bucks! Her pate was pricy for what it is, dog food and bread. lol

Overall, Would not pay full price here, and only come with groupon!
Never again order hot tea. But, I did like what I ordered and want to order more.
