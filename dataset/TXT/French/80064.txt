zv92BYJH09YjFQOtSyYp-A We stopped in here because all the good places that were recommended were full and had a wait. This restaurant is also in a prime location. And because we didn't read the reviews, we paid the price!

It took 2 requests to get a clean water glass. After that, it took a while to get our orders taken. At this time, we started to feel like we made a bad decision. But because we were hungry, we stuck it out. Again, a long wait before we got our food. No bread either. The bathroom was dirty and old. The food was just ok, if not a bit overpriced. The waitstaff were clearly uncaring. They treated us like tourists, not expecting to see us again. As we were now in a bad mood due to the poor attitude here, we didn't enjoy our food at all and couldn't wait to leave. Looking at the other patrons, no one enjoyed their dinner either.

Avoid, Avoid, Avoid!
