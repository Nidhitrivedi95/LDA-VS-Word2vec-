Went here for lunch, had the chicken and waffles and the pulled pork and waffles. Definitely one of the better places for chicken and waffles and the only place I've encountered that has pork and waffles. Chicken was well cooked, moist and boneless! A nice plus. 
Waffles were a little soggy but not bad. 

Would definitely come back for dinner/brunch!
