fyJAqmweGm8VXnpU4CWGNw I lived in France for 5 years, so I'm fairly picky when it comes to consuming French pastries in Arizona.  This is one of the few places that really has their stuff down.  Pastries are awesome, coffee is tasty, and their lunches are damn fine.  I've dabbled a bit in their cheeses which were quite satisfying.  Next, I will tackle their booze selection.
