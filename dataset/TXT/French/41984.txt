Kut9tVbDX_f7qKMRRoXg3w Fantastic service, unique atmosphere and delicious French food will complete your Montreal experience. We had an incredible French onion soup for as low as $8 and huge meat platter for $18. The latter is big enough for 2 or 3 people to share. My boyfriend usually does not eat pate, but this time I couldn't stop him :) totally recommend this place for a lunch!
