3jKUbhGSjFTv5jZ0wnW0xA Came here since the reviews sounded outstanding. We ordered the filet mignon and duck confit with vegetable. Service was great but I wouldn't recommend it over so many other great restaurants available  in Montreal. It kind of felt like a tourist attraction and the food quality is not that remarkable. Not much flavor and no creativity. Not worth the price.
