XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q If this review would be just about the food, I would have awarded them 5 stars.  I am taking off a star for what I would call the bare minimum service- that at times was curt and never once had personality or showed a passion for the food at hand.  Part of the problem is we never really knew who was in charge of our table...there were a myriad of people that came and went with each course and never lingered long enough for us to recognize the face at the next course.  This also may have been because we were a table of 8 that required a set menu.  Even so, I would have expected someone to take us through the menu and explain the food as it was served.  I had to constantly ask for this and one time the server just pointed to our menu in response to a request for a description.  So I guess the moral of the story is not to go as a large group...which is defined by them as more than six.  I think you will get the full five star experience and avoid the $75 large party fee and a mandatory 20% gratuity for average service.
