But it's totally worth the effort. 

The place has decor like it's food. So many interesting, classy, quality choices and small details everywhere. The food here feels like real art, and the restaurant almost feels like a tiny museum(the bar table top is made of leather i think!).

Worth the price of admission for this unique culinary experience.
