SJo_IjvzdRtCvZVN0cbrRQ OK! Where do I begin? My wife and I (occasionally the kids if they get out of bed) visit Blue Door nearly every weekend. The crew is amazing, and once you meet the owner, you see why. He clearly leads by example, ensuring each and every guest is comfortable and welcome. Next, look at the baked goods, they are artwork. Better than art. From the Morning Glory muffins, ham & cheese croissants, brownies, you name it, simply amazing. My wife varies her selection each visit, but I stick with what I love, Corn Beef Hash (scrambled eggs) with their English Muffin (they make them). All the ingredients are locally sourced, fresh, and delectable. Coffee is piping hot, and they never let the cup get empty. There are very few places I recommend without hesitation, but this place is one of them. Keep up the great work Michael and team!
