rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A i was really disappointed with my bouchon experience. i came in with high hopes for the food, but was not impressed.

i ordered the french onion soup, and it was below average. like a 2 on a scale of 10. the cheese was tasteless and too hard. perfect french onion soup has cheese that is melting into the bread and into the soup, but this cheese looked like a slice of kraft processed cheese floating on the soup. because the cheese was so hard and unmelted, it was difficult to scoop it with the bread, onions and broth. sad because the waiter had recommended this.

another dish that has gotten a lot of buzz and that the waiter recommended was the pork shoulder, so 6 out of 8 in our party got that dish. but the pork shoulder was too braised. it was not juicy enough, even when doused in gravy. the root vegetables that came with the pork tasted better than the pork. overall disappointment all around. 

service was spot on, but when i'm paying $35 for an entree i expect it to taste that good. maybe it was an off night but 2 misses means i wouldn't go back.
