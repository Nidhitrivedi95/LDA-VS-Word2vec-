1sN8BsubZbBUI2nS_3LaSg We were a group of 7 looking for a table last minute at 9pm on a Sat night...errr...yeah, right. After being turned away by 3 places that looked at me like I was borderline crazy, the young guy at the front of La P'tite Folie immediately picked up the phone to ring upstairs to see if they could squeeze us in. They were busy but we were in luck as a group was just leaving. So great first impression. Upstairs is a little on the cramped side but you could say it just had that cozy, French bistro feel. I ordered the Chilean Sauvignon Blanc for the table and was pleasantly surprised and everyone seemed to like it, which was a relief as it was the cheapest bottle on the list (I'm not a cheap skate all the time, I promise)! I had the fishcakes for starter and steak-frites for main (well, it would be wrong not to in a French bistro) and was pretty happy. It's not haute-cuisine but it's perfectly fine. The staff were working their socks off all night but remained chirpy throughout and we were all copying their French accents by the end (sorry about that, guys)!
