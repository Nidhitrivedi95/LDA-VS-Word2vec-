San Carlos; it's a quiet hotel
With a restaurant, Bonjour Vietnam
Downtown in the city of Phoenix, having lunch to say........

Bonjour! Bonjour! Bonjour! Bonjour! Bonjour!

There goes the waiter with his tray like always
The same banh mi and pho to serve
Late evening dinner as I came, since the cuisines that they made
To this Phoenix restaurant

Look there I go a foodie no question
I'm super hungry can't you tell?
Always part of any crowd (Yelp)
Cause my heads up on some chow
No denying I'm a foodie guy that Bo

Bonjour!
Good day!
How is your writing?
Bonjour!
Good day!
How is this place?
I need six shots!
That's too expensive
There must be more to this Bonjour Vietnam!

Bonjour Vietnam is a French and Vietnamese inspired restaurant.  Very modern look and feel with some Vietnamese flares.  I didn't catch anything that I would consider French inspired except what was on the menu.  

I ordered a Saigon beer, which I haven't had since I was in Vietnam several years ago, but they were out!  Second choice was Export 33, which was also a Vietnamese beer; oh the memories!  Now to the entree!  I ordered the Cornish Hen with rice.  Forgot what is was called, but it was pretty good.  I think it was marinated and crusted with sweet and spicy sauce; the hen itself was pretty moist and the crust was perfect and crunchy.  I gotta say it worked well along with the steam rice. I would definitely subtract the 2 pieces of squash it came with and the beef broth; which was just pho broth.  I just didn't care too much for it plus it didn't make sense but to fill the plate.  

Overall, the food was good and the service was decent.  The place is oddly placed in the San Carlos Hotel!?  Which I guess is haunted thus the "Ghost Lounge" next door.  Unfortunately, the only ghost around was the lack of patrons and people in the city of Phoenix.  What happened to the night life here in downtown PHX! - Enjoy!
