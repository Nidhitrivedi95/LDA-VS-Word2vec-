We started with the pork and pistachio pate along with the goat cheese and black pepper jam crostini. I like the former more than the later. I found the goat cheese too poignant for my liking. The pate had a Eastern European influence. It was quite savory with a hint of nuttiness from the pistachios. 

For our main course, we shared the wild sea bass. It came with a delicious tomato vinaigrette. It had a wonderful array of flavors and a great balance between creaminess and lightness. I'd certainly recommend the dish if it's available.

I disliked that they were out of a couple dish which we tried to order. On the other hand, they did have a fair list of craft beers and cocktails.
