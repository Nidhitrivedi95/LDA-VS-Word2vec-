3FlWR_osNPb8dcqLgHebHw This location has definitely gone downhill. I want to like Mimi's, I really do. Brunch was a simple order of Brioche French Toast. I asked if they could add berries since I saw them on advertised pancakes. The server, Candace, said "Sure!" When I received the bill, I was charged $2.59 for a side of fruit. While I realize that is not a large sum (which is not the point), I have 2 issues. #1 Any time there is an upcharge, the customer should ALWAYS be informed of it at the time of the order. #2 there were about 8 blueberries and 1 thinly sliced strawberry on the french toast---not even close to the amount to qualify for a "side". 

They weren't horribly busy but it was steady. The server bumped into our table, nearly spilling the drinks several times as she dashed about like a chicken with her head cut off. Parts of the order were not prepared properly and an assistant asked if we wanted freshly ground pepper on our bacon. (???)
