HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw Since we booked our trip to Vegas not realizing it was Easter weekend we decided to make reservations to go to brunch at Comme Ca.  Kinda wish we hadn't.

Our group of 4 all decided to get the brunch special and it was nothing special at all.  The meats, cheeses and sautéed veggies were good, but I felt pretty let down by everything else.  Also, there really wasn't much variety.  I had to make myself feel better for spending money on yet another blah Vegas meal by downing a Bloody Mary...  And then 4 mimosas...

Maybe their regular menu is better?  I'll probably never know...

Oh, and let me once again mention my new pet peeve - DO NOT wipe the table down to prep for the next customer while I am still sitting at the table waiting for my check.  Again, clearing plates and other dishes is fine.  What the hell is with these overpriced places being totally RUDE?!
