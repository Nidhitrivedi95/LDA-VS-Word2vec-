Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA We had a great meal here! The service was attentive. We had lobster and tuna appetizers, both of which were fantastic. The entrees were tasty and the dessert was yummy. Very conveniently located for the Michael Jackson One show. 

Some minor misses, I found the decor strange. Our window side table was isolated from the dining room by the high-backed eggshell shaped chairs of the booth next to us. Also our seating was arranged with our backs to the window, which I found a bit odd.
