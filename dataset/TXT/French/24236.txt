Paired with the fries, gravy and curds I thought I was gonna get wheeled outta there but I was able to overcome most of it. I'm sad I did not get to try the duck in a can, but alas I am one person. Their namesake beer is also very good - very crisp with a slight bitter finish. It's great to wash down the poutine. The complimentary bread is also very good. I wanted to eat it all, but I refrained only because the poutine was so big! This is definitely a must if you're in Montreal.
