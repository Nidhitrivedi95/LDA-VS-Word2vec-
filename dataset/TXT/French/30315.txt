FRuuIDOd21pTJHvEGIt1Gg Beautiful French restaurant, dark wood, laughter, warm aromas. Our family stopped in last night. My wife had grilled salmon that was surprisingly moist. Eldest son had the hangar steak with sweet creamy caramelized onions. Youngest ate fresh salad and country style vegetable soup. I had duck confit with crispy very salty skin. For dessert we had a scrumptious caramel liquid soufflé and nice profiteroles in a tasty creme Anglaise and a fair raspberry chocolate mousse. Excellent meal.
