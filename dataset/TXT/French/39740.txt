K2C8dSx9215LLcIzHL959Q What a lovely experience we had last night at the Twisted Frenchman!  The food was inventive and very delicious!  We started with the grilled baby aubergine which came under a glass dome filled with applewood smoke!  The aroma was delightful and the dish tasty!  But my favorite course was the second.  It was a piece of foie Gras with a cube of brioche toasted in duck fat with balsamic vinegar decorative lines and some onion jam...oh man!  Third delicious beef...now they offer prix fixe for 8, 14 and 21 courses and I'm sure that each would be just as wonderful as we had...the dining room is elegant and comfortable.  You can have a real conversation with your friends.  The wait staff was charming and helpful...no rush, have a celebratory meal, enjoy yourself like a grownup!

Oh, and the wine list is excellent.  I did the tasting pairing...each was just right!  All in all, one of the nicest meals I've had in Pittsburgh...thank you, Twisted Frenchman, for a lovely evening!
