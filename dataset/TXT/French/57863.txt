rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A This is my go-to place every time I come to Las Vegas whether I dine here with friends or even solo. The food here is great. Love love love their butter and jam that comes with the baguette to start.

Last time I came I decided to go lighter and got the French toast and waffles to try. Both were so light and crispy and just the perfect portion. 

Best time to come on the weekend is before 10am if you do not want a long wait. They don't take reservations but they do occasionally put out small pastries for those waiting for a table.
