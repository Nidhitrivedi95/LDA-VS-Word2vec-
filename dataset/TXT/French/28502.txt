eh5mQVLcfIFRaAXF6IAfSg Victoria Bistro is located right next to the cruise port in La Baie, QC.  I saw a sign for ice cream located outside their place.  We were both craving ice cream so in we went.  Their ice cream place is right there when you enter the place.  We did not go into the dining area for the restaurant.

We both had Blueberry ice cream which costed us $2.50 each.  Got to say that it did taste pretty darn good.

I would go back again if were in the area.  Maybe next time we'd try eating at their restaurant also.
