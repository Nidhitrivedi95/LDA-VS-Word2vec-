4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw This place does have really good food! We first came here on m birthday 2 yrs ago and I had the Poisson Du jour..which was herb crusted salmon with lemon buerre....it was divine!!

and the location is so romantic..if you go on a regular weekend. 

We dined here again last week, and I had the skate wing which was really well cooked. The cauliflower puree brought out the fish's subtle yet delicious flavor. 

It was a little too crowded for my liking, but still very good food overall.
