jSfnItqaOnEp2nenVF7fCg Very small place but well design... Went there for lunch and was  very quiet... the soup of d Jour was very nice so the quiche. The cabernet burger was delicious but I was very disappointed with the lamb panini... very blend... I'm glad that I tried that place for lunch I'm not sure for dinner.  Not too bad but I'm no sure if I'll return :(
