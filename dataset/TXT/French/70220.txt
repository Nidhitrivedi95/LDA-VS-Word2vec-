x_1Yo9ArcbitR6NQC7tOUA This is such a cute and charming place !  But the food is what makes a restaurant and this is definitely a great restaurant! We all chose, in our party of four, different apps, entrees and desserts just to be able to try different menu items cuz we just couldn't make up our minds what to try and everything we ordered was so amazingly delicious! We are determined to return and eat our way through the whole menu! Love the array of locally sourced food on the menu! Also a great place for drinks and sharing plates if you don't want a full meal!  And the desserts........ !  Love places that make their own desserts from scratch!  I can't say enough about this place! I definitely give it a 4.5 star rating!
