HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw Trip worthy and 10 stars!  This restaurant is going on this foodie's "Top" list and I've eaten and many Michelin starred resturants.  Foodies, this is a MUST DO when in Vegas.  I will be flying back here just to experience Comme Ca in the near future, the food, the ambience, surpasses all fine dining expectations.

Which dish impressed: ALL from the creamy simplicity of mac and cheese to the complex but classic seafood, the flavors perfect.  The best meal I've had in a long time.

If you can, ask for an outdoor table, isolated.  It was as if we girls had our own private room, right under the lights of the strip.
