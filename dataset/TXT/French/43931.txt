m9aFZk1f8tSv248YErbpQA We visited town for my great grandmother's birthday, and the party was hosted here.  

It was absolutely delicious!  I ordered the atlantic.  I love smoked salmon, and this was some of the best.  

Did I mention they opened the place after hours just to accommodate our party?   That alone is 5 stars, but their awesome service, and awesome food sealed the deal.  

Definitely recommended!
