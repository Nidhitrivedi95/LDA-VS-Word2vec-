xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g Made a reservation with this restaurant to celebrate my 50th birthday 3 months ago. One hour before the reservation (6:30), they called to tell me that, due to unforeseen circumstances, the restaurant was closed for the night. Huh? I asked if they would accommodate me somewhere else and they said no. We were staying across the street at Bellagio and noticed that the restaurant lighting was all on despite them being "closed." A little fishy to me!!!
