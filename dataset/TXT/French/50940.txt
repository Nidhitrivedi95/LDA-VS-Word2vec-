oZHbPhIj01_31jqD053a_Q This is perhaps one of the best gastronomic experiences that I've had! Europea came highly recommended by our concierge at the Omni and I mean, who am I to question a guy who's sole job is to know the ins and outs of extra curricular satisfaction? He described Europea as an unforgettable "experience", and that it wouldn't disappoint as a birthday dinner. And man was he right! Two best adjectives I could use for eating at Europea would be theatrical and inventive! There were tiny beef jerky hanging off a clothes line, cheese rolls inside a cigar box, and smoking appetizers in a book! I don't want to spoil anymore surprises but the 6 course meal was well worth the price. We left stuffed to the brim unable to even finish our several desserts. Everything was well thought out and service was prompt and tremendously attentive. I do recommend booking in advance--we went on a Wednesday night and it was fully booked! The waiter told us that weekend nights they're usually booked out 4 weeks in advance. And make sure you set aside at least 2 1/2 hours for the experience. I highly recommend this restaurant and $85/person for a 6 course meal was worth every penny!
