xBxDMEkFK5GBhiy-8gGE9w Actually came upon this place trying to find somewhere I could meet the feeble alotment for my company meal travel policy.  Found the menu online and decided this was definitely better than any number of nearby restaurants price-wise.  While I could have met the meager limit set by my company, I quickly decided to go beyond for my own enjoyment after perusing the menu once seated.
I had a glass of Reisling with the pan-seared foie gras and then a Valpolicella with flank steak, and everything was truly superb.  The wines were excellent, the foie gras was an excellent decadent treat with a side dab of what I believe was pureed squash to balance out the fatty goodness of dearly departed Donald, and the flank steak had a butter/dill/sage (I think?) topping that really balanced that out nicely as well.
The servers are all very polite and helpful, a decided bonus for the english-speaking Anglophile in French-Quebec.  All told, I walked out of there at about $55, which is really a bargain when you take a look at the price list at comparable places.  
I will now be hitting the gym, sauna, and possibly examining bulemia after this indulgence, but I would definitely go back once my cholesterol drops back below 400lb man levels.
