rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A This place is absolute heaven. I came here for brunch and the croque madame was out of this world! Eggs cooked to perfection, creamy delicious mornay sauce. Our lovely server was quick and attentive.  The decor is classy and calming.  It's pricey, but a meal that you will never forget.
