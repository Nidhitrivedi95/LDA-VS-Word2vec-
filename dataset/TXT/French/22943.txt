bzbNGyrTwWHAgg1CqkSgeg I'm happy.  This is the first time I had breakfast and now can couple that experience with the many lunches and some dinners here.  All experiences were good.

This is a cafe with a full bar.  Nothing fancy, but it is comfortable with a good menu.

The breakfast was basic with some nice spins.  I had a three egg, must have been small eggs at that, omelet with hash browns and toast.  Juice.  The omelet was just fine, but small and the hash-browns were outstanding rounds of crispiness on both sides.  Bravo!

The surprise spin was strawberry jam, which I first thought was a form of ketchup.  I don't like strawberry jam, but tried this guy and it was terrific.  Just mushed up strawberries with just enough lemon and sweetener to bring out their best.  I must say that I inhaled that jam on a piece of rye bread and it was like dessert.

The waitress, Melanie, told me that they have some other home made jams that they rotate each week or so.  Last week I missed blueberry mango.  Yes, I sure did.

My wife and I especially like their lunches.  Menu has great plates, salads and sandwiches and all meals have fried green tomatoes available.  Dinner menu is not too different from lunch, just a few other main plates.

Nice atmosphere, good for first dates, business meals and simply a place to get fed and have a few drinks...perhaps.  They do a good job and you will like the flatware, glassware and plates. You will see.
