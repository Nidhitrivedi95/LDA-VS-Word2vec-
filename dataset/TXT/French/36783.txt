iEsNloJgy-MyA-_wqeB6jg Okay, a few questions. 1) Why isn't this place advertised better and 2) Why wasn't it packed? I ate there on a Monday evening using a restaurants.com coupon to try it out based on some recommendations. Simply outstanding. The owner, Louis is fantastic and I wish I had his energy even at my age!

I had the fresh Caesar salad, escargot. stuffed mushroom and baked lobster tails. My wife had the Lobster Thermidor. for dessert it was a Grand Marnier Souffle.

I simply cannot say enough about the food. Everything was perfect. I had forgotten all the ingredients that go into a REAL Caesar Salad, but the preparation tableside quickly reminded me what I had been missing from restaurants that use a generic Caesar dressing. The salad was simply out of this world.

Maybe the prices scare off some customers but I've learned most often, you get what you pay for. Definitely applicable in this case. I'll be back...
