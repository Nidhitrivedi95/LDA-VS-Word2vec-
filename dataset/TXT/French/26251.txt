d4bVdEDwxmyB0M-w5vNNPg Living so close to the ever vibrant Yonge Street I too often over look Mount Pleasant's little restaurants. Not this time though, and I'm glad I didn't.

This little french restaurant is cozy, warm and charming with an inviting sign outside enticing you to come in out of the cold. 

The restaurant is aptly named with a small concise menu that offers just 7 appetizers and 7 simple main courses. One of each meat really: steak, chicken, lamb, duck, scallops, trout, a vegetarian option.

Each is artistically presented, full of fresh perfectly cooked food and covered in an always delicious sauce. All the main courses cost exactly $25 and the appetizers $11. 

My advice, order the lamb! 

Typically, I am not a lamb fan but this stuff was melt in your mouth delicious. Everyone at the table agreed it was the best of the meals we ordered (duck, scallops and lamb). 

The desserts are equally simple and delicious. Get the sticky toffee pudding. It's sinfully good.

The one complain I had about the restaurant was the lighting. I like my restaurants dimly lit and this one was not. Far from a reason not to go again though. I will return.
