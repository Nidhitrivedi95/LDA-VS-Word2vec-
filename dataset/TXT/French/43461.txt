And this little institution in the heart of Montreal sure reminds us why the baked bean is so amazingly good. The joint has been around since the 1930s and still gets rave reviews and a steady crowd lining up for traditional Quebec nosh. The articles and photos on the wall are testament to its popularity, and the beans are pretty dam tasty. If you are not a beanie, meat pie, meatball and pig's feet fagout, shepperds pie and pea soup all compete for second - (they will put hairs on your chest). And for the real lumberjacks, follow up with quebec sugar pie, 'pouding chômeur or blanc mange. Yeah!
