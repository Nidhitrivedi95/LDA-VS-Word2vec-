d482l58ho0_IMdFkXX1F5Q Went when it opened for an early lunch at 11:30am.  You opened the doors so have some service.  The bartender was the waiter for someone at the bar, our table which was close to the bar, and a table clear across the restaurant.  They had two women just standing around near the hostess stand.  Was one of them a floor manager?  I don't know because neither one of them were moving, just talking.  Their French onion soup was truly one of the best I've ever had.  But then the rest of the meal, (a decent quiche for me and a croquet monsieur for my hubby) came out slowly and without the fries my hubby ordered.  It took us another 5 minutes just to find the bartender who was MIA.  Even the patron at the bar was wondering where he disappeared to.  Well he forgot to order the fries.  So my hubby is almost done with the sandwich and the fries come and unfortunately and obviously underdone.  Nothing worse than soggy white fries.  By that time, we weren't going to complain, since this was supposed to be a quick lunch.  What I found odd was for a restaurant that was created by a reputable chef, why weren't any of the front of the house people as well as the waiter coming by asking us how was everything?  No one asked the gentleman at the bar how his burger was either.  Well when the bartender brought us our check he took the fries off the bill.  That was nice but he didn't even ask us how our meal was?  Someone in management needs to see what the workers are doing on a Sunday morning in this place because for these prices you can't afford hiring statues.
