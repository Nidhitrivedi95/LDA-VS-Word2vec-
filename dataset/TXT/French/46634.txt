nkHaix6KenApS8M-liZsCQ Christopher's has half priced wines by the glass at happy hour!! And did I mention they have a book of wines, not a list, which makes choosing a few rather challenging! 

The food was fantastic! I had a hamburger with Gruyere cheese and mushrooms, which I gulped down in about 5 minutes because I was hungry and it was YUMMY! 

After 3 hours of sipping wine with new and old friends at the food bar, I decided it was time for dessert! The Chef, Christopher himself, brought me out an impressive chocolate tower!! I am still dreaming of it today! 

I had a wonderful and pleasant time at Christopher's. You can tell the staff goes above and beyond to make their patrons happy and they are very friendly!  I definitely need to come back and have a 'real' meal. From what I saw from the 'kitchen' bar, I will not be disappointed.  And I am not sure there is a better happy hour in town considering the quality for the price!
