eOZ4oBegPNY5nFrX2lpGHQ My fiance and I were in Montreal for 1 night and decided to get dinner here. The restaurant is on a quiet, residential street. At first we both thought we had the wrong address; however, when you get to the front of the restaurant it is a small but very nice. There are only 9 tables here so make sure you get a reservation! They were very accommodating with ours as we switched it a few times because we got last minute tickets to the Montreal Canadiens hockey game.  We had decided to both get the 5 course tasting menu and the food was amazing! The best part of our meals were the main courses - we had the bison and the duck. I highly recommend getting either. Lastly, the chef came out to our table at the end of the meal which was super nice of him. 

Please keep in mind this place is BYOW - there is an SAQ nearby (only a 7 minute walk).
