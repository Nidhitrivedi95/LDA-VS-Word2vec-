4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw My husband and I had brunch here and it was wonderful. Good prices, adorable ambiance, impeccable, speedy service, and everything we ordered was delicious! I had the smoked salmon eggs Benedict and my husband had the normal eggs Benedict. Eggs were perfectly poached. I had a tasty Brut/peach juice cocktail and literally a bowl of cappuccino (I thought the waitress meant the cup would be the size of a bowl - was literally a bowl!). The foam was thick and perfect. Waitress gave me a to-go cup.
Was a little line to get in - but moved super fast, and we didn't have a reservation. We sat inside (outside was a 15-20 min wait) and we're right inside the glass. Loved it and will definitely go back! Would recommend to anyone.
