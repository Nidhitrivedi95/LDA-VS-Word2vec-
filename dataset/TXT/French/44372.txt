ME6D5nLlfG0xZCtICOYDuw While visiting NC , this is one of the places was offering thanksgiving buffet. Upon seating I got there a little earlier than scheduled time and was seated promptly. Service superb, and food tasted very good . All sides were delicious. More of formal environment . Highly recommend at least for thanksgiving buffet but will definitely try their Sunday brunch . You are on top of my list to try on my next visit here .
