YUFxSG6idHePsxOmnSHtpQ To start, I don't think Mimi's was prepared for the crowd they got on thanksgiving. We had made a reservation for a 3:00 pm turkey dinner in hopes that there wouldn't be much wait for our party of 4. Little did we know hundreds of others did the same thing and many more walked in placing their names on a list. The little wait we expected turned into a 30-45 minute wait. 

After we were finally seated, the wait began again. Waitress and after waitress walked past us ignoring our table. No water were brought and not even a "we'll be right with you". So we finally got up and approached the manager after a food runner was kind enough to bring us waters. The manager went around and asked the 2 waitresses working all 4/5 tables surrounding us and none of them took responsibility or seemed to want our table. Little did we know this was a blessing in disguise. 

Monique was given our table even though it seemed her section was no where near our table. She turned the whole meal around. She was attentive, kind, threw in some jokes and really was a sweetheart. 

Given that it was thanksgiving, the meal was good for it not being my home cooked meal but it was pretty tasty. Also the serving size was huge which allowed to reach that "over capacity" feeling everyone deserves in turkey day. Mimi's is a good choice if you are looking for a holiday meal. But on any other day try and get Monique as your server. You won't be disappointed.
