It melts in your mouth (Got mines done medium rare). Very tasty. For appetizer, the chicken liver patey is also an excellent choice.  I recommend that you use the baguette bread that you get as starter as it tastes better with it. The French onion soup is alright. You can't RSVP to sit outside in the patio area. This is first come, first serve. It has a great view of the Bellagio fountain show. You can however, RSVP for inside through Open Table.
