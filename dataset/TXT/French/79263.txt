ZdaZwXC0FByDY3EwNELphw Made a dinner reservation a couple weeks in advance. They called to confirm a couple days ahead of the reservation but was out of town so missed the call. They cancelled our reservation.  We did not make another reservation and had a wonderful dinner somewhere else.  What was the point of making the reservation in the first place if they just cancel on you?
