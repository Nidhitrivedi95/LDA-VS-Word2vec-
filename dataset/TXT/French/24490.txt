for appetizer we orders the quail. it served whole which is kinda freaky. it tasted like soy sauce. I'm assuming that there was much more than just soy sauce, but it overcome the rest of the flavors.
my husband ordered the lobster which he said that it was really good and our friend order the lobster roll which based on the clean plate - he liked it.
me and my friend shared the special hen for 2, which should have been hen for 3.. it was very juicy, but the white wine flavor was too sharp for my taste.
oh - we also had the mushed potatoes which were very rich and cheesy - not good. 

the server was very sales oriented, which was kinda annoying, but that's about it.

average to my taste, but the rest of our party liked it.
