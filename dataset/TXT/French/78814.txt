ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug The worst service I have ever had in my life. The server, Patsy, didn't even welcome our table to the restaurant. She had no knowledge of the menu when my party asked simple questions regarding it. She forgot one of my friends' sides, and never brought it when she asked for it. She finally brought the side dish when she brought the check and made her pay for it, even though it was too cold to even eat at that point. 

When our table asked if we could get our checks because of trying to make a shuttle back to the airport, Patsy ran off without saying a word. When she returned to the table after another 15 minutes, she had realized that she had messed up the bill. Rather than apologizing, she said, "I gotta hurry it's my break time!" After another 10 minutes she threw the bills on the table and ran off. She obviously was excited to get to her break without a single penny for a tip. 

Save yourself the time and frustration and choose one of the hundreds of great places to eat in Vegas.
