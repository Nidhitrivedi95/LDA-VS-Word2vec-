XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q AMAZING! One of the best meals of my life! Five stars does not do justice for this place. The food was incredible and the service, impeccable. It was as though the servers had been through restaurant bootcamp. They were professional and thoughtful. The bread cart was enormous. There were so many different types of bread to choose from. Our favorite was the gruyere brioche. I think I had at least three of those that night, in addition to our 16 course meal. And who could forget that dessert cart that they pulled out at the end of the meal. I thought I had died and gone to heaven. It is definitely a meal to remember. I cannot wait to go back again.
