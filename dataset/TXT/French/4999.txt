33Tr0eRki1Yamzleu4GMdw I drive pass Rosallie about 10 times a week! I've been wanting to try this place since it opened, and I'm glad I finally did. My girlfriend and I got there around 4pm, there was 2 other tables lounging around on their laptops. I was starring at the menu like a deer in headlights. Confused and overwhelmed with their menu. I asked the gentleman behind the counter to recommend and explain some of  the popular lunch items. The first thing I knew I wanted to order was their almond pie, but unfortunately I came too late that day and they had already sold out. I asked about the soup of the day, and again..... No more soup! :( 
I finally settled and ordered: 
Chèvre Chaud (goat cheese pastry) Salad with a piece of melted Brie cheese. IF YOUR ARE A CHEESE LOVER... YOU WILL FALL INLOVE WITH THIS!!! I had two is my favorite cheeses together on one plate! It was heavenly!!!! 
My gf ordered a Brie sand which. She said it was also really good! 
I can't wait to go back and try other dishes! Maybe next time I should go earlier, before I'm too late again!
