8ciT6qjI18x9EPtOb-gqYQ Went for restaurant week. Had the brie to start. Sounded a lot better than it was. Barely warm brie, some dry apples on top, don't know what was carmelized about them, some fruit on the side and some toast. I saw nothing that was bruleed. Dinner partner had the Escargot, which was good. Second course was petite filet mignon. Petite is right! I should have paid better attention to that word. I was pretty surprised at how little it was. It came with decent sauce, three warm tomato slices and maybe 5 small pieces of potato wedge. I've had better steak fries. Disappointed. Dinner partner had the sea bass, nice flavor but also tiny portion!! Other dinner partner had the pasta. That was good and thank goodness he let me have some or I would have stopped at Culver's on the way home. Their fries are better than what I got by the way. Last course was Hazelnut Tarte. Pretty boring chocolate in boring non-flakey pastry with a few pieces of nut on top. Not impressed. Had called previously to see if their portions were smaller for restaurant week. They told me I wouldn't go away hungry. Wrong. Service was lackluster, had to wait quite a while between courses, had to ask for drinks to be refilled.  I'm sad that I wasted one of my restaurant week picks here. Won't be back.
