eUjDWzbQ6eLZy0uELEOa9Q The Boiler House is a beautiful restaurant.  I love the decor, I love the building, it makes me want to get married again and host it there.  It is truly lovely.

I went with the wonderful Yelpers for our book club meeting here.  There was a very nice jazz band playing.....really quite close to us actually..... which essentially made book clubbing impossible.  But if I was to come here for a brunch-date it would have been perfect (especially if we sat further away from the band!)

The staff was very attentive, and Kat T even managed  to smack one on the bottom (I missed the complete details due to the loud music.)  Who doesn't want to go to a place where you can smack bottoms? Really now.

The reason I'm only giving it 3 stars is that I didn't find the food that impressive to make it worth $25.  The buffet offerings were okay, but nothing that made my squeal (or moan) in delight.  I had an omlette from the omlette station, which got stuck to the pan and had a well-done (read: burnt) look to it.  For some reason I also had it in my mind that beverages would be included, and altho perhaps coffee was juice was not, which I found disappointing.  

Brunch is my favourite meal of the day/week.  I can't even begin to describe how much I enjoy this meal (check out my description of brunch at Bonjour Brioche).  The food wasn't worth the price, but it is a really gorgeous venue that I might bring tourist friends to for a relaxing meal.
