gh6__q2WXFuyN8gt6VAnWw I come to this restaurant every so often for social dancing or dance lessons. Vila has been a good venue for that. 
I recently tried the food here and was not impressed. I ordered the seafood pasta which was a huge portion. Probably could feed 3. The price was around $15.
The first thing I noticed about the dish was how salty the sauce was. This was seriously the most salty sauce I have ever tried!! The saltiness completely killed the dish for me. I let my friend have the rest of my dish because I gave up trying to enjoy it and she was also shocked by the saltiness. 
The seafood inside was cooked just fine. Maybe could have been cooked a little less and the noodles also just fine. 
One thing I didn't like was the upsell on drinks. When I eat out I like to order tap water with lemon. They said they don't give free water and only sell it by the bottle. -_-. I ended up purchasing a CAN of soda (means no refills) for $3.50! 
If you're going to serve food that salty, you should at least provide ice water so I'm not dehydrated after the meal. 

I'll be back here but just for the dancing and maybe a glass of wine or cocktail here. I will not come here for  the food! The gross pasta dish and the no free water policy completely scared me away.
