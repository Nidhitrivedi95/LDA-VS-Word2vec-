dd3GZs6zW2t7BM0cbxAzvg AMAZING FOOD, bloody expensive though.
Service was great, live music, friendly cosy atmosphere.
I got the vegetarian option which was heavenly, hands down some of the best meat free fare I've ever had, my boyfriend had the lamb stew which he said was equally fantastic.
Good wine and beer list, creme brule was delicious but minuscule (2 bites?) as it was on a prix fixe option.

Expect to spend $140 for two with booze, but it was well worth the expense.
