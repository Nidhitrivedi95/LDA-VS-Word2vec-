rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw My bf and I were excited to try Bardot for dinner based on pictures I had seen in IG and review on here.  We were even more thrilled to find out it was by Michael Mina.  

We started with the escargots and foie gras terrine.  The escargots were prepared different from what I am used to and were beautifully presented.  IMO I think the escargot were a tad dry and chewy based on the cooking method.  The foie gras terrine was rich, creamy and just perfect.  It went very well with the crusty bread.  

For our entree, we split the bone-in rib-eye with the horseradish creme, side of mac and cheese and mushrooms.  The rib eye was cooked perfectly and had a nice crust.  I love the look of the mac and cheese which tasted like an adult updated version of the blue box from our childhood.  The mac and cheese was extremely salty for my taste which was too bad.  

Our meal was delicious and our server was very nice and sweet.  But as the meal progressed, she was non-existent.  She came back to check on us once and we never saw her again.  When my bf went to the restroom, waitstaff stopped by our table a couple of times but never picked up the empty dishes nor did they fold his napkin.  This is what I would expect.  

Overall, I might come back to Bardot.  With all the competition Las Vegas has to offer, I feel they really need to step it up in the service dept.
