xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g Like being in Paris, but you aren't. You are paying for the view...the service needs a bit of polishing, and the closeness of the tables to some of the busboy carts leaves something to be desired.

However....if you stop here a bit later for a drink with someone, you WILL enjoy the view, the wine is decent, and the restaurant can add a memorable event to an already very nice night.
