4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw We came here for lunch and loved it so much we came for breakfast the next day. Such a cute and classy place. Friendly staff. And delicious food! We ordered an array of appetizers for lunch since we hadn't had breakfast. The salmon, olive tapenade + burrata, and tartare I could eat all the time. Breakfast had amazing french toast and salmon eggs Benedict.
