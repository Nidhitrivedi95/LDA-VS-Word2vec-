A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g Sinful eclairs! I am a bit of an eclair snob and have to say these are the best eclairs in Vegas. 

These good people are masterful bakers and their deserts are astounding. I haven't tried the rest of their menu yet but plan on working my way through all of their treats first. They have become a regular stop on weekends to pick up some sweets. The baked goods are incredibly well prepared, gorgeous in appearance and SUPER yummy taste. They care about their food and it shows.

Staff is always attentive and friendly which is a great addition to their wonderful product. Highly recommend stopping in to have a little treat. You know you deserve it!
