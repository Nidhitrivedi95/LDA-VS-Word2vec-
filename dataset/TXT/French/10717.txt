4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Have loved this restaurant since they opened years ago.  Until I can get back to France, this place allows me to get transported for a couple hours.  Really like the crispy, delicious baguette that gets served in a paper sleeve along with a delicious carrot slaw/salad and softened butter.  Very nice touch.  

We loved the chicken liver mousse pate and the escargot.  DH had the kale bacon egg salad - divine!  I had the moules frites - also divine!
