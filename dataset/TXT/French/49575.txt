or4UVDjXEEjze3wNPjoAZA What a wonderful place for lunch! 

First time here and was greeted instantly at the front door. Enjoyed French soup, the basil chicken sandwich and a bottle of Trimbach pinot Blanc. 

Everything was very delicious and the ambiance is even better! Eiffel Tower in the center of the restaurant, huge bulbs that illuminate the restaurant throughout. 

Glenn our waiter was superb with every recommendation, swipe of removal of plates and every wine pour. 

Next time will certainly try out the chocolate soufflé, sadly no room this trip! 

Will surely return.
5/5.
