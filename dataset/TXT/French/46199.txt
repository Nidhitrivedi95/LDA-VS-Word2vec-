myJ6pgIhN42EQh2sAVXKoQ Toma Burger lives up to its reputation. The burgers are slow to come out but it is definitely worth the wait. Don't forget to ask for the homemade condiments its waaay better. The owner and chef comes in at 4am to make the buttermilk buns with the signature "T". The truffle fries are so salty but delicious. Highly recommend! Where else can you go to a burger joint but also have a glass of wine?!
