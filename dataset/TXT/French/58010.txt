rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I can't wait to come back.  Enjoyed brunch sitting in the patio. Weather was great and the view of the pool was just relaxing.  

Great service (as expected and of no surprise), loved the ambiance, and the smell of bakery.

I had the white sausage (home made) it had a soft texture inside (I thought it would be dense like a traditional sausage).  The perfectly baked fluffy buttery flaky croissant left me wanting to go back asap.  The ice tea came with its own decanter and I can't explain why this unsweeted Ice tea was so good!

Love their macaroons. I'll see you soon Bouchon!
