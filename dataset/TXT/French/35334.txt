Ht-_i0UAq7YDBaqJwcQMdQ Excellent dinner experience! With an understated entrance, this place has an intimate atmosphere but not too dark. We started with scallop - perfectly  seared and seasobed. For entrée, I had the halibut with black rice and squash while my friend had the signature dish Chasse et Peche, both of which were well executed. We also had Bombe - a caramel tarte with chocolate sorbe and Strates. Loved every bite of our food and will definitely come back!
