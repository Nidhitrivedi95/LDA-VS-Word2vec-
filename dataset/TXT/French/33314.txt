In addition to really good food, quality croissants, and excellent coffee, the hospitality from the manager and his staff will make this a regular stop for me anytime I'm in the Southwest part of town in the breakfast and lunch hours.  And it's so close to the forthcoming new IKEA store!  Bonus.

Personalized hospitality and kind service like this is hard to find in Las Vegas.  Bravo.
