nkHaix6KenApS8M-liZsCQ So my Dad has been wanting to go to this restaurant for forever it seems. He lives on the East Coast and saw it in some restaurant review article. 

This week he came to visit so we decided to make reservations. The restaurant had a typical Biltmore atmosphere, nice but snooty. The chairs were very comfortable and the decor was nice. However, there did seem to be a lot of white noise which kind of made it difficult to hear my 4 dinner companions. The bathrooms were very clean and had a really neat sink/rock sculpture/fountain thing going on.

But that's not why you're reading this review. You're reading for the most important question, "How was the food?".

The appetizers, salads and sides were great. We tried the buttered lobster salad, the parsnip soup, the curried duck fries, potatoes au gratin, and the asparagus. They were all quite yummy.

Desserts were also yummy. We had the vanilla flan, the tower of chocolate mousse, and the profiteroles au chocolat. Nom, nom, nom. Is all I have to say.

The entrees however, were very disappointing. The duck two ways was bland and both ways tasted exactly the same. The rack of lamb had almost no flavor as if it had not been seasoned at all. I've quite frequently made better racks of lamb myself at home. The truffle oil filet mignon was also merely adequate. The portions were extremely small 

Honestly, for the price Christopher's just really isn't worth it. While the appetizers and desserts are yummy I've can easily have similar items as delicious at much cheaper restaurants. The entrees are definitely not worth it. Small, bland, uninteresting, and overpriced.
