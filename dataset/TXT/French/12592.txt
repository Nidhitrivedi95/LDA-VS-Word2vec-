4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw What a little gem this restaurant is, located in Paris! This is always at the top of our list of places to eat whenever we go to Vegas.  If we don't stay at Paris, this is probably THE only reason we step foot into that hotel. Food is so wonderful, I usually get the Rib-Eye & it is always seasoned and cooked so perfectly!  Price is as good as it gets for the quality of food that you are getting.  Highly recommend this place for a nice and delicious steak dinner!
