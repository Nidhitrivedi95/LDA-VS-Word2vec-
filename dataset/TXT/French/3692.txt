27vF5LESbv4kFQfHZUDCnw Ok I love the baked goods, sammys and croissants here. Everything here is well made with care. Kudos to the pastry chef! Really delicious baked goods. 

My issue with this place is the service. I live around the corner and have been here about half a dozen times in the last month. Twice I have walked out because of having to wait so long to have my order taken or even to be acknowledged. They are not prepared to turn over orders quickly here. Woman at cash has to put together pastry boxes to fill orders. Why aren't these boxes all ready put together? This is just one example of what holds up orders. I understand presentation is important here but each order takes far to long start to finish. I hope they fix the service issue because I would like to come here multiple times a week.

Few days later:
Ok back again this morning hoping to get a couple of their delicious Croque Monsieurs and some other pastries. Again one person serving a bunch of people and here I am waiting for too long. Not sure about the guy who works there who was sitting and chatting with a customer - could he have helped the single person serving customers so the rest of us aren't waiting so long?

This place drives me crazy and I won't be back. That was your last chance, Tempered and you failed. Terrible customer service. 

Did you even notice me walk out?  Probably not.
