ER7tPnGV6RET2zprEAWOSQ We had a dinner for six where everyone was disappointed. Both the 5oz and 10oz tenderloin was over done and grisly, the shrimp wasn't tasty, the duck was plain and smothered in a blueberry sauce (which was OK but way too much) that over powered the duck itself.

The dinning room was very hot as they AC was turned down to accommodate the dinner who sat near the one vent in the room. 

There is better for much less elsewhere.
