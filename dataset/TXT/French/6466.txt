4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Great location! right across from the fountains at the Bellagio and on the street for people watching.  We ate outside and even though it was 90 degrees, the AC was cranked up inside and leaked out to the outside tables.  I do not like to be hot, so it was perfect! 
Had the onion soup, it was only OK, sweet without any beef or onion flavor.  Ordered the filet, medium rare.  First one came out well done. The second one raw in the middle. The third one cam out medium instead of medium rare, but I ate it anyway.  It was good, but would have been great if it had been properly cooked. My husband got the NY strip and it came out perfect. It is huge at 16 oz. The waiter tried his best, but the kitchen let us down.  
Four stars for hubby's meal and mine steak once it was done properly, other wise 5 stars for location and the rest of the food.
