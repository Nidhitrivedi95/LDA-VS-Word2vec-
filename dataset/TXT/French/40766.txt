kcF-en40P3J9L8nLy5lKqQ First time and were excited to try it out. Food was mediocre. Chilaquiles had two lumps of cheese on them instead of spread out and were just barely warm as were the eggs. My friend ordered steak and eggs and the steak was very, very small, made the dish look empty. Other friend had to send back his fries bc they were cold. Bloody Mary was really good. Don't think we will go back....
