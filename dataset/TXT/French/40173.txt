KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA Not kid friendly! We arrived around 5 pm, knowing that we did not have a RSVP and expecting a little wait. Upon arriving with our 12 year old daughter the Host stated it would be a little wait. There were 3 more groups of adults that were sat without a RSVP prior to the Host telling us they could not serve us and we had to leave. I have eaten there plenty of times, the food is poor and over priced by sitting by the water is what we go for. That being said go to Garfields next door. Way nicer employees, better food and kid friendly!
