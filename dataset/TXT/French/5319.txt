3FlWR_osNPb8dcqLgHebHw Came here for dinner tonight. It was our 1st time at this location. We normally frequent another location that's closer to home. 
Tonight we came with a party of 6 (3 adults and 3 children). We only waited a few minutes to be seated. It was surprising to discover that the restaurant wasn't busy on a Saturday night. 
I don't remember our server's name, but she was great from start to finish! 
She was prompt with bringing our drinks, bread basket, & taking our order. We ordered a bowl of corn chowder, the bouillabaisse special, turkey dinner with a side salad, & 2 kids meals. 
I don't know what it is about the carrot bread in the bread basket, but it's so good! Everyone wishes we just got a basket full of it. 
Most of the food was awesome, except for one of the kids meals. Let's start with the good.. It's nice to see that the Mac and cheese wasn't Kraft. It was freshly made in house. The downside kids Mel was the corn dogs. My 9 year old sister only at 2 (their minis). She said it tasted funny.. 
Aside from that, it was a great evening at Mimi's.
