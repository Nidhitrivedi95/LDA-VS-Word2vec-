rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w It was a fun Vegas weekend with the guys, and what better way to celebrate my friend Kevin's birthday than a fancy dinner, right?

ATMOSPHERE: Festive, fun, but very high class and hoitty toitty.  The crowd was very conservative looking and everyone spoke at a whisper.   

FOOD: Amazing! The salad was clean-tasting, perfectly seasoned, and the lobster was uber-fresh and perfectly cooked.  The filet mignon with foie gras was melt in your mouth delicious, even though I like my steaks cooked medium-well (I know, but get over it).  Finally, the pear souffle was cooked to perfection and tasted like silk!    

PRICE: 98 clams for a three course prix-fixe is not bad considering the quality of the food, the pitch-perfect service and the fact that this is Vegas.  Their wine list was very comprehensive and quite impressive.  For those who don't care to spend $5K on a bottle of DRC, you can get a 750 of Papapietro Perry for about 100 bucks ... not too shabby.   

SERVICE: Absolutely perfect! The maitre-d, server, sommelier, and bus-boys were attentive but not over-bearing.  The sommelier shared an interesting story about the paintings on the walls, and when I informed our server that they failed to remove the twine from my filet, they immediately took it back and brought out a re-plated entree.     

CONCLUSION:  If you're in Vegas and you want to splurge a bit, I highly recommend Le Cirque.  The food ws great, but what sets this place apart is the impeccable service. Oh, and the little truffles they leave you with (in the cool red boxes) are a really nice touch!
