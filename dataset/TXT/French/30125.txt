fRu_POqPowUo6nHSRMjOPw Went here for a wonderful Valentines Dinner, big surprise from my guy. 

The restaurant is located just inside the main hotel lobby doors off to the left. 

Really liked the place for it's simple, but super modern elegance. They had a special Valentines menu, but the items all contained chocolate (chocolate soup?) and it all seemed a little over the top, so we stuck with the traditional menu.

The special of the day on Saturdays is the Surf & Turf special, so we both went ahead with that and it did not disappoint. Steak was cooked a perfect medium rare as requested, and the lobster was tender. 

Menu is balanced and they had a good cocktail selection and large vine list. My daiquiri was divine.

Perfect spot for either a date or a business dinner/lunch.
