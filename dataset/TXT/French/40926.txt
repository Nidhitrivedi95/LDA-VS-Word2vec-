kcF-en40P3J9L8nLy5lKqQ I was and still am happy to see a new resaurant pop up in this area.  I have been able to dine at Central Bistro twice since it has opened.  The restaurant has an impressive wine list and knowledgable servers.  I wish the food was as impressive. I was with a group and we ordered 8 different dishes to share family style.  I enjoyed a delish salad and the standout entree was the chicken parmasan with a side of mac & cheese.  
Central Bistro did a wonderful job on the buildout and decor.  I will definitley be back for a glass of wine, but there are other italian restaurants I prefer in the area.  Not bad, not great but worth another try someday.
