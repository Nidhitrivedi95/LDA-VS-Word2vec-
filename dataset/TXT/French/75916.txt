ynYEgNimJOyb8dvyr9x0sA There are a lot of reviews on this place ... all I can add is it's a nice addition to the over saturated Phoenix market that seems dominated by bland chain restaurants. The owner was on site when I visited and I saw him quickly handle an issue at another table. Our dinner was great.

If for no other reason than to treat your palate to a new experience, you should try this place.
