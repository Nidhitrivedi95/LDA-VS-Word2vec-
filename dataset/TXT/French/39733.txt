K2C8dSx9215LLcIzHL959Q Phenomenal tasting menu with wine pairing. Each course was beautifully prepared and creative. The Foie Gras was the star but all courses from the butter poached sturgeon to the duck were Divine. The wines were perfectly matched. It was so refreshing to have a new bright and creative restaurant in a time when so many new restaurants have a sense of plagiarism.
