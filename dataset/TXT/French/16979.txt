9ET_RUNztevq4_OLAX80Gg We actually stumbled across Cafe Boulud while in the neighborhood looking to celebrate a birthday.  We got more than we ever imagined!  The Steak Au Poivre was absolutely outstanding and cooked to perfection.  The service was very attentive and  helped us make this a day to remember.  If you are looking for a top tier restaurant look no further.
