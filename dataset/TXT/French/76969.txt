The service was amazing, all staff appeared to be bilingual, there is a beautiful patio, and the decor inside is very "I'm in paris".  The crowd is a little older, a little more sophisticated - it's definitely not full of boisterous young drinkers - but it's plenty lively, full of that charming Montreal upscale hustle and bustle. 

With a great wine list, and 4 or 5 beer options (as well as cocktails), this was the perfect place to grab a late afternoon snack and beverage. Also at our table was the cheese plate, and the frits. As cliche as it sounds,try the FRENCH fries, they're beyond delicious. Between that and my Stella, I was in heaven. (There is also a full dining menu, reasonably priced)

Cafe Cherrier was a delight to dine at. Great service, charming atmosphere, delicious food, and blocks away from other restaurants, shopping, and anything else you might be looking for. I think you may even be able to see Heidi & Seal's house across the park...
