4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw After a long two nights in Vegas, the gals and I decided we were in the mood for a GOOD breakfast. Fellow Yelpers steered us right into the arms of Mon Ami Gabi. 

After a very short wait, we were seated in the sun room at a quaint little table across from the Bloody Mary Bar. (This was a BIG hit with my girlfriend!) Our server was friendly and attentive, and we loved the open-air, non-smoky environment. We all seriously felt like we could be back in Paris, sitting at an outdoor cafe. It was kinda perfect!

We all loved our meals- I ordered the chicken, broccoli, and cheese crepe. It was a delightful meal, and I wouldn't hesitate to go back on my next trip!
