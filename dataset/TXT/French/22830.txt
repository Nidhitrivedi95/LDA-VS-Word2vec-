It was very cold and rainy so we waited right inside the cafe. As we were waiting we noticed that the seating arrangements made no sense. They seated two people at a table for four, when a family of four had been waiting for a while. They did this multiple times then had to push two tables together to seat families of three or four. We also had to ask if our table was ready as it had been over 35 minutes. Once seated, our waiter quickly introduced himself and asked for our drink order. Next, he asked for our meal order. Our food came quite quickly, and it tasted pretty good. My older sister ordered pancakes, and was very impressed. My younger sister ordered two animal pancakes, an egg, and bacon. She was also very happy. Both my parents ordered chicken and waffles, and enjoyed the food as well. I ordered a red velvet waffle with a side of grits and bacon. While the food was good, it was not amazing. Enjoyed the experience but the 35 minute wait was not quite worth the food.
