B56AYe5GNuavMDtwFsXqzA We had a guest staying with us from NYC and wanted to impress him with a fantastic Sunday brunch.  The food at Petite is consistently top notch and the services is always helpful and we have never felt rushed.  

I know some times fancy or french restaurants can be a little intimidating.  Our server, Amy, did a fantastic job of making us feel comfortable and took excellent care of us.

The 3 course Prix Fixe includes bottomless mimosas and is well worth the price.

I started with the mussels which were fantastic and not fishy at all.

Then I moved to the steak and eggs.  I prefer my eggs over medium.  Instead of simply flipping the egg to cook the other side, chef used a torch to cook the other side so the egg didn't have a mashed, browned appearance. This attention to detail is what really sets Petite apart from the rest.

For dessert, I usually have the beignets but wanted to mix it up so I got the Nutella crepe with bananna.  It was a prefect finish to an outstanding meal.

Our out of town guest said it was the best brunch he had ever had!
