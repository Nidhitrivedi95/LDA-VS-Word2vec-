Portions are huge, and they use fresh ingredients. I love how their salad has a very very light dressing, and they didn't douse everything in it. Home fries are chewy on the outside and fluffy on the inside, and bits of fried green and red peppers come with it. All their food items are done very well, in my opinion. They do not overseason and nothing was too salty, which I appreciated. They have a cute patio, and nice tables by the window. Each table has fresh flowers. 
The place is filled with paintings, and their music is enjoyable.
Overall, a comfortable place for a hearty, filling brunch. Nothing fancy, but quite homely and cozy, and in a quiet and great location. I have found my favourite brunch place. Their menu is quite extensive (their online menu is outdated).
Only thing that is stopping me from giving 5 stars is the fact that they left out a portion something in our dish, even though the exact portion was clearly stated on the menu...For example, they say they'll give you 3 of something on the menu, but only give you two on your plate...I thought I was crazy, but reading another review on here, I see that this is something they do once in a while. I don't think they're doing it on purpose, because they do have a large menu with very similar dishes.
