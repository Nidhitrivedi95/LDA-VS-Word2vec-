FRuuIDOd21pTJHvEGIt1Gg Excellent Sunday Brunch.  Good friendly service.  We had a reservation.  I'd suggest that.  I had eggs.  Bacon. Yummy potatoes.  Included a small smoothie and bagel.  I like my bagel with a little more crunch ( warmer ). But was still good.  Everyone else enjoyed too.  A definite yes.
