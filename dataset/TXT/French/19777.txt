There is no seating, but there is a shared seating area upstairs. Selection is slightly different at each one. The manager works downstairs, so if you have a 25% off coupon from the Bouchon restaurant, you need to go there to use it. There wasn't a line the times we went.
I bought a pain au chocolate (chocolate croissant shaped into a rectangular roll) for breakfast. It was flaky and delicious, however, it needed more chocolate! There were only a few chips...disappointing. However, the other baked goods I got to take home were excellent.
First up was a strawberry cupcake. It was gorgeously made and topped with a small chocolate disk. This one tasted like it had buttermilk in the batter. It was moist and ever-so-slightly tangy. Really excellent paired with the strawberry cream. As good as the ones I make! ;)
Then, I got 4 different flavors of macarons. The vanilla one was fine, as expected. The chocolate caramel was the favorite. Rich caramel flavors in the filling. Delicious! Strawberry and chocolate were good also. The macarons are about 1/3 larger than the usual. They have a perfect crunchy exterior, the frilly "feet" that are mandatory for macarons, and the right amount of creamy filling. The texture is slightly chewy at room temperature. If you do refrigerate them, make sure they come up to room temp before serving.
Overall, expensive, but worth it. Can't go wrong with the cupcakes and macarons.
