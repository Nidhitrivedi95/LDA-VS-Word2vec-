4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I loved this place!! Considering that it is located on the Strip, the price is beyond reasonable!!! We shared a large carafe of Sangria and it was great amount for the price. I loved that all the servers were actual French and that they really make you feel like you are in France. 

As long as you are not sitting outside, your waiting should be really short. We got seated right away. I think people wait for outdoor for the Bellagio fountain scene but we were too starving 

Service was amazing and their complimentary bread, carrot side, as well as our entree was superb. I highly recommend this place to anyone who is looking for fine dining in the Strip without $$$ price tag.
