KBSCJcWGk9QNPX9MTSlM3Q Stopped in because of sidewalk sign promoting a $10 beer and burger special.  The burger was just ok.  Not bad but not great.  I didn't like the bun, it was too dense and chewy for me but that's just personal preference.  My problem with the place is the drink my girlfriend ordered.  Vodka soda... $11.  Not a grey goose or anything fancy.  Bar rail vodka soda.  I asked if it was a mistake and was told no, that's the price.  I was stunned.  Then when my change came I was forced to tip either 5% or 25%... Not breaking up bills in change for tipping is a pet peeve.  I like to do 20% but don't like being forced. Waitress was polite enough but I don't think I'll be back.  Menu was interesting though.
