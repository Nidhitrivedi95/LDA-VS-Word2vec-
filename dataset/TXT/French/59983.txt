sARavfidmIS878q5BtlyVQ We had reservations for Friday Feb 10th. We had followed all the rules for getting the reservation (emailed at midnight on Jan. 10th). When we were told we had the reservation a few days later we immediately sent in the confirmation form with credit card info.  All was set. Then on January 21st we received an email saying that our dinner reservation happens to fall on "Valentine's Weekend" so they are going to charge an additional $100 per person. And were we okay with that? So to recap: we followed their rules, made the reservation and then they decided to just change the rules. We're not naive--they will of course easily fill the spot at the new price ($250 per person before the $155 per person wine service.) so essentially they don't have to care whether we say yes or no. There's a line long of folks eager to take our place.

But that doesn't make it okay.  It is unconscionable to treat people like this.  I realize this is Vegas and money is all that talks. But on some level doesn't this scream about the lack of professionalism? Jose Andres is a great chef, but he should be ashamed of the business culture he has given his name to. We canceled. No meal, no matter how delicious can make up for being treated with such indifference.
