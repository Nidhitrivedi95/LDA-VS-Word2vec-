rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Worst service I have ever experienced. We were informed that the wait would be ten minutes. The place was not packed and there were some tables open. Several parties (not just one or two) came after us and were seated. After 35 minutes we asked about our seats. The response was "Oh! Right. Your party for two... Umm let me see... We can sit you.. Soon?" How unprofessional. Management needs to step it up a notch. I have never experienced this type of unprofessional and absent-minded service at any other Bouchon I have had the pleasure of dining at.

We went to Bellagio Buffet instead and waited half the time for an even better meal.
