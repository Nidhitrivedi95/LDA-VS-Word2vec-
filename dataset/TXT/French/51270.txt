P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ The French menu at Guy Savoy was outstanding. We selected the Innovation-Inspiration Menu. Rather than picking from the world class wine list we had the sommelier pair wines for each course.

1. Amuse Bouche
2. Concasse of Oysters, Seaweed, Lemon Granite
3. Langoustine in Cold Steam - A highlight of the evening that was wonderfully presented
4. Asparagus, Caviar and Fresh Cheese
5. Salmon Iceberg - The preparation and presentation was unlike anything we have seen before
6. Lobster, Vegetable Serpentines and butter sabayon - I loved the flavours, but the technique in this dish was even more impressive
7. Foie Gras, Quinoa, Duck Potato Chip Consomme - We loved the foi gras
8. Artichoke and black truffle soup - It is clear how this became Savoy's signature dish
9. Smoked roasted duck - The duck was beautifully cooked
10. Japanese Wagyu - Wonderful ingredients wonderfully prepared
11. Desserts - A range of desserts each carefully prepared!

A fantastic evening of French food, interesting wine pairings and exceptional service!
