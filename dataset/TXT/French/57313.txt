rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A We made reservations via Yelp for a 6pm time slot for 6 people. Once we arrived, they took us directly to our table! Service was friendly & prompt although our server seemed busy with many tables to cover.

Husband ordered the following:
1) Confit de Canard - crispy duck leg confit with potatoes & mustard sauce (2 orders)

2) Foie Gras Sauté - Pan seared Hudson Valley foie gras (4 orders)

3) Escargots a la Bourguignonne - burgundy snails, garlic butter & bakery puff pastry (1 order)

4) Grand Plateau - 1 lobster, 16 oysters, 4 shrimp , 8 clams, 10 mussels, crab $110

All dishes were delicious & filling! So glad the seafood is fresh here :) 

this was my 2nd time here & really liking the foie gras! Tasty & flavorful -- can't get this in California anymore!

I think dinner is better than lunch but definitely more expensive.
