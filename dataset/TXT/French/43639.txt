m4PW-GMc8JOU5nmMYncu-Q What a fantastic bar! I had the "Lemon is the Sky" recommended by the bartender as her favorite drink and it was incredible. Tasted like I was drinking a lemon meringue pie. The bar was just dark enough, the music was just loud enough, the service was just attentive enough; truly a great experience for a unique late night cocktail.
