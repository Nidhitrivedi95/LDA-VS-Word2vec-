gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg Reliable bar / restaurant that has good beer.  Always a good place to wind up at in Montreal.  Comparable to the Gordon Biersch chain in the states, Les 3 Brasseurs brews their own beer on site (supposedly) and they are all pretty damn good.  The waitstaff is very attentive and are all thankfully fluent in English as well.

The Burgers are good, the Flamms are alright, but they had this baked brie thing that was pretty damn good.  Prices for food and beer are about a dollar more than what you would expect in the States, but that's to be expected in Montreal.

Every time we go here, it's always busy but they are able to take care of anyone who comes in.  Tried to get a table at Le St. Bock down the street but it was jam packed and not a single person working there tried to accommodate us.  Like I said, this place is reliable.  There are plenty of other places to get better drinks, but it's nice to know that Les 3 Brasseurs is always there.
