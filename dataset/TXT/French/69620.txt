When we got there, it wasn't exactly what I expected; I was picturing more of a breakfast diner.  This place was huge with a big indoor and outdoor section and the entire place was packed.  We managed to get a table quickly but a line formed soon after we sat down.

The menu was impressive.  There were probably 8 different eggs Benedict and all of them looked awesome.  I ordered a fruit smoothie to start and it was delicious.  For breakfast I had an eggs Benedict that came with salmon, spinach, and cream cheese.  It was pretty amazing.  I didn't take advantage but it seemed like they had a pretty impressive drink menu.  The 20+ person bachelor party sitting behind me was taking full advantage with breakfast shots.

Overall I bumped this down to four stars because of the atmosphere.  It was a little larger and more crowded than I would have liked for a breakfast place, but the food was very good and the service was decent.
