TXuhhudKvAb3JIYD_wELhg A rainy summers day in Edinburgh. I'm not here for the comedy festival, so I expected not to get in, but they were very accommodating. I skipped the starter and has the Coley for my main course, and some yummy cheeses for dessert. Gorgeous. Great service and timed perfectly. The waitress even went through my cheeses describing and naming each of them. Looking forward to my cheese dreams :-)
