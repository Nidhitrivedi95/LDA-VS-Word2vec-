bzbNGyrTwWHAgg1CqkSgeg I am writing this review while I'm sitting here at breakfast (which is probably rude) considering that my breakfast date is looking at me. The atmosphere is really rustic and welcoming. First- it took the server roughly 7 min to even greet us or take our drink order (not terribly an issue) but I do like to be acknowledged in a reasonable amount of time.

The food came from another server who was visible distraught because of how busy she was but the food was amazing. I had the Chicken and Waffles- it was delicious but not the best I have had in Charlotte (that belongs to NAPA). It was priced correctly and the waffle wasn't cold or soggy. The chicken was moist and breaded just the right amount. Overall I was very pleased with the food. 

Problem is that- although the food was great- the service was abysmal. My server saw me twice- to take my order and then again after I was done with my food so she can ask if anyone checked on us that entire time. They didn't and I waited 5 min to get syrup. I would have waited longer if my guest hadn't gotten up went to the server station and ask another server for syrup. I would have actually waited until my server came back to the table. The server was apologetic but that wasn't merely enough for not even asking if they got our food correct. It was the first time in almost 7 years that I tipped only 15% of the bill. This was a Thursday morning not Sunday brunch. I was disappointed.

Again- great food but TERRIBLE SERVICE.
