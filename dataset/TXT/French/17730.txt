9ot8oInkYZTt6wkkGe__vQ I decided to give this place another chance and here is my update.

I had 3 appetizers and a main course.

Apps:
Bisque : 5/5 Absolutely delicious!
Sweetbreads : 5/5 Again, loved it completely.
Foie Gras : 3.5/5 Tasty, but the combination on the plate is heavy on heavy on heavy.

Main:
Duck breast : 1/5 It was served nearly raw and chewy (I couldn't swallow it, had to spit it out), the sauce was not a good companion to the duck and the lettuce side with sour minced meat in the middle was just bizarre. I sent it back and kind of lost my appetite.

What a terrible end to an otherwise very tasty meal.

On a side note, their bartender serves a really great Martini.
