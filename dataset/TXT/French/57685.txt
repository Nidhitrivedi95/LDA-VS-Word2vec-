rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Amazing service!  The entree's are about $20-$35 each so it wasn't too bad.  Had the french onion soup to start and it was beautifully presented, the broth was beefy and flavorful and loved the gruyere cheese on top.  I had the steak frites and even though i was hesitant to get a flank steak, it was grilled nicely and to my Medium -rare, it also cam with a mountain of fries which I wasnt even able to finish.  Love the horseradish also, very strong so becareful when you use it.
