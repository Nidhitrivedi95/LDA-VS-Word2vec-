Love Bardo's roasted beets and goat cheese salad and onion soup. You cans add truffle, braised oxtail and poached egg to your soup for a very special treat. My husband is a big fan of Bardo's steaks and lamb rack frites. Great atmosphere and service even during holidays when Las Vegas strip restaurants a lot of times are overrun and can't deliver.
