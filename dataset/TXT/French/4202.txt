2gUbgbdJ7IFSbicBXlSchw This is a lovely restaurant. I'm giving it four stars because the service was excellent and for the most part, the food was tasty. We started with a warm goat cheese salad (delicious). For dinner, my husband got poached salmon with chervil mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes were fantastic and the fish was good enough. My main (chicken with a mustard sauce) was perhaps not the best selection ... the chicken itself was a little overcooked/tough. I was expecting a quarter chicken but instead I got a very thick breast (which probably explains why it ended up tough). For dessert, we had a maple tartine, which was delicate, flavorful and not overly sweet. I'd definitely recommend giving L'Express a try. Our waiter was fairly honest when we asked for suggestions, so perhaps this is the way to go.
