kGOr_D-LNpgZ2M9N8TT4QQ I've gotten all excited about La Societe! Gotten their neighborhood fancy mail specials a few times and reading up all the reviews just made my mouth watered.  So, I decided to make a reservation on this fine Thursday.  Since it $1 Oyster night I thought it warranted a pre plan attack, though it wasn't needed at 730p.  We were greeted promptly and brought to our candle lid table.  The relaxing atmosphere and ambiance were exactly what I've expected. Most tables were empty or their patrons were just impatiently waiting for their bill.  Unfortunately, after 10+ mins no server is to be seen, no water, no "Hi, I'll be with you in a minute"...  We had our wine picked and perhaps, delicious food that can be tastes in our mouths, but we just had to put an end to a potentially a bad dinner service. [Sorry, service 1 of 5 stars]
