QEgfK_TKY8bwK-YzKDdkGw I have been fortunate to dine in many places all over the world. So for me to say that Lumiere is in my top 5 is saying a lot. It also is a very unlikely location (a small strip mall) for such a fine dining experience. But do not let that fool you - this is excellent french cuisine!

The interior is well decorated, and the service team is very friendly. We had escargot, french onion soup, and the duck confit for starters. All amazing. They also brought an amuse bouche of a soup shot and a pastry that were both great.

The entrees were fantastic! So much going on each plate, with a generous serving. I had a filet mignon served over a brioche with seared foie gras, black truffles, asparagus, and mush rooms. Simply divine. My girlfriend had a pork chop, with chorizo pork sausage, french beans, and something else I forget - also amazing.

And dessert was great too - black cherry creme brulee with lemon sorbet and flourless chocolate torte with brown butter gelato with marshmellow glaze. From start to finish, an excellent dinner in what I would consider a "hole-in-the-wall" location. If I lived in Charlotte, I would be eating here regularly.
