1cGyzWtfOoDiE8V0OR85yA What a charming little gem in North Oakland! Every once in a while, I'll venture out from Forbes Ave to the different and slightly more expensive options on Craig. The french toast crepe is delicious (served with real maple syrup) and my cafe au lait was up-to-par as well. My friends that came with me ordered the white forest (white chocolate, whipped cream, and rasperries) and the Nutella (simple, but great nonetheless!). If you want to put an intimate spin on your normal bagel-and-coffee date, give Crepes Parisiennes a try!
