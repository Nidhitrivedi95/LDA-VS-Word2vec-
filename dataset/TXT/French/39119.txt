jo4KmAqlZ7vxjHIP7IIkAw Came here for winterlicious dinner. Was a set menu for 28$.

Apps
 salad 4/5 - very refreshing dressing, just the right amount and a kick to it, walnuts added a great texture
Escargot 5/5 -definitely one of the better escargot had, very good texture and flavor highly recommend

Main 
Duck 3/5 - mediocre. Cooked well and very tender but the sauce was a bit sweet for me personally
Lamb 3/5 - cooked very well and comes right off the bone, the marrow was very good, but personally the meat was not seasoned strong enough and was a bit bland.

Dessert
Gateau creole 3.5/5 mediocre chocolate cake, moist with a subtle hint of rum, but nothing spectacular, can probably find at grocery stores
Creme brulee 3/5 - very good flavors,  only complaint is it was a bit cold

Drink 
House red 2/5 do not recommend even though very cheap,it was almost lukewarm and did not even taste fresh. was a cabernet merlot blend but did not have the flavors at all, not impressed for a french restaurant.

Service
5/5 very friendly staff, very quick to prepare and serve the food, no complaints

Overall 3.5 nice and small french restaurant on Baldwin, good experience but nothing  amazing enough to try again for repeat visits. But recommend for those who havnt and looking for an affordable, tasty french cuisine,especially their winterlicious set menu if they offer again, just for the value, $28 for 3 courses.
