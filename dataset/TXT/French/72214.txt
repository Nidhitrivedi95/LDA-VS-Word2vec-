XKPosZx2j4RHcZ8Ewdwj0A Hubby and I had a craving for some classic French food and found Lemeac on Yelp.  It did not disappoint.  First and foremost, the restaurant is located in such an adorable neighborhood; the snow had fallen on the shop-lined street and created this beautiful setting.  Once we got to Lemeac, we got exactly what we were looking for. Service was impeccable and the bread, salad, and our main courses (cod and braised short rib) were fresh and delicious.  We topped off the delicious meal with light and fresh blancmange with citrus and passion fruit. We wished we had more time in Montreal to come back and try more items on the menu. Bon appetit!
