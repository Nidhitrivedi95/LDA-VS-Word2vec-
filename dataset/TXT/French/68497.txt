vLkKorA1gPS97Zj0_WKA0Q I'm shocked by all the poor reviews. Wifey and I are both foodies, and Twist served us one of the best meals of our lives last night.

The decor is stunning, and the floor to ceiling windows offer a mesmerizing view from way up high on the 23rd floor.

The service was impeccable, friendly and helpful but not stuffy. Water glasses never got more than half empty, menu advice was helpful and knowledgeable, and we felt like royalty for the duration of our 2 hour meal.

The food was incredible. I love molecular gastronomy, but unlike WD50, Alea, or other mad scientist chefs, Twist used all the foams, gellees, and other tricks to accent excellent dishes, rather than the central focus.

The amuse bouche was creative, fun, and delicious, a very nice introduction to the chef.

I had the 3 course tasting menu with foie gras 3 ways, and lamb 2 ways. Everything was perfectly cooked and seasoned and indulgently decadent. Wifey had the Las Vegas appetizer which features pear wrapped in red tuna sashimi, along with other treats like sweet corn and beet sorbets with popcorn. For her main, she had the John Dory which was also amazing, with fresh seafood cooked perfectly.

Grand Dessert Pierre Gagnaire is 5 courses of dessert inspired by traditional pâtisseries. They were all excellent. We each had different favorites.

Dinner for two, including cocktails, tax, and tip was $300. A fair price for one of the best meals we've ever had. The restaurant was nearly empty on a Friday night, which made for an intimate evening, although it's not a good sign.
