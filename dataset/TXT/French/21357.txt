B56AYe5GNuavMDtwFsXqzA Dinner was wonderful. I'd expect to pay a bit more for this quality of food. Delicious, helpful staff with food and wine knowledge, and a good atmosphere. On the negative side, the menu is short and has very little variety. They say it changes everyday, but I never see anything new on the menu. We paid $112 for two appetizers, two entrees, two glasses of wine and a dessert for two. Good value, great meal.
