USleI8g1UVN9-9jm-b4uIg Tonight is our 3rd year anniversary and the atmosphere was prefect for our occasion.  The food and service was awesome!  We ordered escargot and fois gras for appetizer, the fois gras was fantastic!  We ordered the elk chop and veal chop!  The veal chop was tender and the elk chop presentation could have been better!  This place is definitely a romantic place and very pricey!
