t1mR_Zff6Dqv1TueE2JLEA This place is definitely more about the experience than the food.  Everything tasted like it was bulk prepared, it didn't have much flavour like real Moroccan food.  Even though I felt  like I was being transported to Morocco with the decor and belly dancers, I was disappointed by the food. We ordered the 3 course meal and I had the chevre, lamb leg and creme Brulee. My lamb was so bland, unfortunately.   My friend had the beef cheeks which was the most flavourful of everyone's meal, if I went back I would get that next time. The belly dancers were great! Get up and dance with them!
