O66Zy8Y13VBm72ZDhS4fIg Came here with my family for Summerlicious. Good menu. Fast service for Summerlicious... I got the gazpacho as an appetizer, tasted kind of like eating cold salsa from a bowl. My Mom had the tomato salad, which was okay, could have made that at home quite easily but I do understand that the Summerlicious menu is often easier than a regular one. I got the asiago mushroom penne, very cheesy, good portion of mushrooms; which I liked. I had the panacotta for dessert which was delicious. Overall it was alright. Wouldn't return to pay full prices for it. Maybe Summerlicious isnt the best time to try the place, but I came here in the Fall 2013 and it was better then.
