xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g As a proud American I always recognize how the French have been our allies - however I haven't had much personal experience with French food.

Where can I even begin - first if I could give it a 7 I would! This was the finest meal, on all counts we had while in vegas on "food crawl-2016 (c)" seriously.

We started with the house champagne- very lovely.

That was followed immediately by a demitasse filled with a purée of savory onion and cream - they described it as a savory cream, very custard like for cleaning the palette.

From there we moved onto the cheese plate consisting of French cheeses, spiced Feuilletine, honeycomb and candied walnuts.

Next we moved to the Classic Escargot laBourguignne, garlic and parsley- so delicious and yes a puff pastry too.

From there we decently moved to the cold Foie Gras Torchon duck with fig compote and brioche.

Whew - after that we enjoyed some bits of candied fruits and chocolates.(think Turkish delight)

They honored us with a parfait of chocolate mousse- one of the lightest and most satisfying deserts I have ever enjoyed.

We enjoyed their special roast (coffee) - it reminded me of coffee I enjoyed in Chili. 

The service now that's a whole other review - they were professional, prompt but in no way pushy. They maintained our water glasses and then would vanish. If the meal was not the most amazing ever the service pushed it it up to 7 stars.

Did I mention it was extremely affordable?

We strongly recommend the Effiel Tower and we give it Five out of five forks"
