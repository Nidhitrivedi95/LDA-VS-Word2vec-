QEgfK_TKY8bwK-YzKDdkGw This review is based on restaurant week.

We wanted to try somewhere different this time around for restaurant week and Lumiere seemed like the perfect option.

My husband and I were promptly seated when we arrived.  The waiter was very friendly and brought us waters.  We were indecisive about our wine bottle choice but had a staff member help us pick out a bottle in our price range.  

We both ordered the scallops and the chocolate tort.  We ordered different entrees to share I ordered duck, John ordered beef.  

We received soup and cheese bread as a started. My initial reaction was wowwwww the portions are soooo tiny.  I was basically licking the little cup clean because it was so amazing.

The second course was the scallop and lobster dish.  This was delightful and amazing as well.  

My duck was really good, but Johns beef dish was out of this world.  

The portions were so small so I was still starving and would have been content with some bread.  I noticed other tables got bread, so we might have gotten missed.

I'm saving the best for last...the chocolate tort.  OMGGG it was so good.  

Overall service was good.
