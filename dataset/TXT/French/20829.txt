AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw Surfing the web for good recipes for French Macarons.  I saw a video from Food Network featuring Wolfgang Puck and he describes about nuts and everything and especially how he loves it in a Macaron!

FYI Macaroons and Macaron are not the same.  Macaroons are these coconut small baked goods.  French Macaron is these two cookies that are sandwich together with a specific flavor.

I walked all the way from ARIA to Cesar's Palace in a search for Payard's in particular French Macaons.  I spoke to one of the works, and told them I was looking for French Macarons and she said she wasn't sure if we had any and I just had a shock look!  It was only around noon.  I didn't know they were that popular.

So she asked her manager and thankfully they had some in the back and hurray I got it!

I didn't even hesitate and I just ordered a dozen for my girlfriend who likes them very much.  These are good eats and are expensive and worth every penny.  

I have attempted to make Macarons several times and it's very difficult. It takes a lot of techniques to get the batter correctly.

The store had a lot of stuff to try.  They serve fresh crepes and assort types of chocolates in nicely boxes.

Overall, these Macarons were very different from all the Macarons I have tried.  The shells were very hard and smooth, great texture.  When you take a bite, the shell breaks and the middle is soft, following with cake middle.  The filling wasn't that sweet at all; I think it was just right.  

Cash or credit or bill to your hotel?
