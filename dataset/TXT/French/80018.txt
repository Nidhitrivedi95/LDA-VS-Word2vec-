ZuYsZvJ5r32Fs70vPXbRgw Have been driving past Celestin for many years, but have never been inside to dine. A pal wanted to check this place out so we decided to take advantage of their Winterlicious Menu. The decor inside is quite nice and simple - it's all navy and white. It's not a big place so I would highly recommend for you to make reservations.

I ordered the following to make my Winterlicious Lunch Set:
1. Eggplant and Portobello Mushroom Tart and Balsamic Dressing
2. Roast Red Pepper, Goat Cheese and Chicken Quiche Served with Mesclun Lettuce and Citrus Vinaigrette
3. Chocolate Ganache Tart and Confit Ginger Ice Cream

The food was a-ok; nothing to write home about, but also not terrible. Portion sizes are good and there's a good variety of items on their menu that anyone can dine here. Service was also a-ok.
