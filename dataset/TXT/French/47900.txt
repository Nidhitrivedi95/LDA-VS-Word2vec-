O3OH5IEFMPtz7mPKakPZ3Q Came for lunch, got a chicken bento and beef gyoza for about 15 bucks... Talented chefs with quality food, and good service.  I can definitely recommend it.

Edit: I've been here like 5 times now and I've had most the menu, and I'd say half the menu is great and the other half is ok.. So it averages out to slightly above average for me..
