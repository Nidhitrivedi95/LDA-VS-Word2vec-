u-SvRRAfYgpbXZRfQgcTzA Now first off i'd like to say that I've only eaten here once, and if/when the day comes that I go back and decide what I wrote is wrong then I will change it...
But, anyways.
The look and decor of the restaurant is nice and trendy, the employees there were nice. Menu was really small.
I tried the fried dumplings, they were average.. And I also had the ramen, only because that was the only option as a main dish, and I was not pleased at all, it was the second worst ramen i've ever had! :-/
Benefit of the doubt.. .. Maybe it's just not for me, I see alot of good reviews for this place. But then again, this is the point of reviews! :-)

Happy eating!
