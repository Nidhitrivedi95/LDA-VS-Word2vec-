Yp9w4nhUowBU_IS_StFXbQ I happen to stay at the Wynn. Real amazing, love the decor and the food is excellent. Order Oscar Benedict and the pressed duck
Expensive but worth every penny 
When seated ask for the complementary pastries. Staff are very professional ( almost too much)
I will be back for sure
