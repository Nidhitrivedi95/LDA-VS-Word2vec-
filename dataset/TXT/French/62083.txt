SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ great atmosphere - the appetizer, salad and wifes trout were excellent. My rack of lamb which was recommended was just average.  
The waitress was attentive when around but appetizer plates with empty shells sat through most of dinner, salad plates when empty left till entree arrived.
For the price ot the restaurant those kind of items do make a difference.
We will be back because we like the overall experience, but details need to be picked up.
