BSmqxPbQglQwP2R56OqOag My new favorite restaurant near Grayhawk.  How could food and service be so great after just one week.  Amazing value!  Staff is superb.  German, who owns the place, walks around and genuinely engages with his customers not in the usually patronizing or obilgatory way.  Wait staff is actually enjoyable to talk with.  This place has really figured out how to make you feel welcome.  And the food was amazing.  My only fear is that we may be going so often that we'll get burned out.  But if so, it will take a long time.  A fabulous experience in every respect.  Welcome to our neighborhood, Local Bistro.  Please stay for a long, long time.
