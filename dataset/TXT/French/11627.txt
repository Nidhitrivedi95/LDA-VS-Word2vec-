4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I like this place. The service was good. The food was yum and the view is the best part of the whole experience. This place doesn't really need a review. You can tell it's awesome from the strip. It's stood the test of Vegas time and that means a lot. Since we are a ever changing city.
