K64Uw3a2Enh2MznpwRHWKQ The Chef's table at Razz's is out of this world good.   We had 10 dishes and each of them were absolutely incredible.    i could write pages about how phenomenal this meal was.   

here's the bottom line - if you're going to scottsdale and you have ANY night open for dinner - book the chef's table in advance.   you will be blown away.
