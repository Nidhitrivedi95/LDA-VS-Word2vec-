4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I never really tried these outdoor restaurants on the strip, but this was a first. You would be surprised to find out that you could find a good restaurant like this one with an "ok" price. It was great to dine out in the patio while watching the waters of bellagio... Now for the food...
The steak was cooked just how i like it and it was a perfect portion. It was fun just watching all the drunk people walk by... you never know what you'll see or miss if you're not looking at the right time...
The service was pretty good... although i couldn't tell if our server was putting on a front with the whole "being proper" ... the best part was trying to guess what he would say next.. kinda reminded me of Carlton from fresh prince. lol. overall.. great place, i would eat here again!
