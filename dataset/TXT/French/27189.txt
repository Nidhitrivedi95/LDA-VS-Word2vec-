dd3GZs6zW2t7BM0cbxAzvg In planning our trip to Toronto, I asked my husband if he had any requests. In this case, he did have one: he wanted to try horse meat, since it's available in Canada and not the United States. So I found this spot which (as far as I could tell) is one of two places in Toronto that serves horse. And it's even on the brunch menu, which worked well with our plans.

We walked in here one Sunday morning before a baseball game (that ended up being great for Blue Jays fans, but not for me, as my precious Astros lost 9-2), settled into a table near the back, and ordered mimosas. The ones here are a little pricey but definitely worth it because they use wonderful fresh juice (which seems to be rare these days). Then we both got the benedict with horse tenderloin. Maybe one of us should have gotten something else to contrast and compare, but it was time for ADVENTURE!

What a delicious adventure it was. It is true that hollandaise makes everything better, the horse meat was delicious and tender like butta. I probably could have eaten two servings because it was so amazing. I'd like to have some for brunch this week, but I'm almost 2,000 miles away now, so that's not going to work.

Maybe I'm just going to have to come back to Toronto so I can have it again. Can we make that happen?
