_cjPEH9wXhKS-HQe_U3M4Q This is my favourite place in Toronto to take my mother to brunch, because you can make reservations, the service is consistently good, and the quality of the food has never disappointed. I find their dishes a bit rich, so I don't go here very often. But every time I do, it feels like a treat. Fantastic duck confit.
