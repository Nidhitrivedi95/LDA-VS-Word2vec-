Amazing bread! That's important to me.
App- Split the beef bourguignon poutine and brussel salad w my wife. Poutine was a large portion and very good. Salad was AMAZING. Some kind of honey dressing w crunchy grains and soft fresh mozzarella cheese.
Entree- Braised lamb leg in an asian style broth. Sounded interesting so I went for it. Very good. That said, the top of the chop that wasn't on the broth was luke warm. I know they can't braise to serve...but it should at least be hot.
Others at my table had the burger which was massive and delicious. Hanger steak and frites was very solid too for a cheaper cut of steak.
Veal meat ball tomahawk was just ok. Sauce tasted too tart from all the wine in it that almost tastes like they didn't cook it down enough. Kind of tacky jamming the bone into the meatball for the 'tomahawk'.
Drinks took a while at first. Service was friendly and solid though!
Fun spot!
