Jbl6p9CVkfCB8fWYFd2-Qw I want to say up front that the only disppointing element of this place was the loud trains passing by while we ate outside. Beyond that, everything was great. I tried the tar tar sampler of tuna, salmon, and steak and it was amazing! It came with a fried egg which I haven't seen before but it was the perfect touch. My date loved the bread pudding dessert.

The ambiance (outside of the train) is beautiful and comfortable. It feels as if it was designed by a professional interior designer, and the outdoor seating is well done too with an overhead canopy and finished stone flooring. 

This was my second visit here and I was not disappointed. A few of the reviewers here seem to be disappointed with the price. This is a well done French restaurant, not a budget chinese stop, so I don't understand what they expected. If I'm going to eat raw meat (tar tar) I want to know there is a clean kitchen and a professional chef and I expect higher prices. Who is going to eat raw meet from a $2 burger shop? 

DO plan on parking valet OR use Uber/Lyft. It is very difficult find parking on a weekend. The restaurant itself has never been crowded, it is just a very difficult area to park being so close to both Case and Little Italy.
