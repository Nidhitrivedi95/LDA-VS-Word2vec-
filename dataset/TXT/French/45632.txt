mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q So we have read so many things about Joel that we had try this Michelin rated restaurant during our stay.  As you now this is an upscale counter service version of his restaurant and everyone was dressed for the experience.  This is counter service so you will be sitting close and next to other patrons, so be prepared to be open and friendly as well as hearing interesting conversations. Now there are two tasting menus. One for $69  with 5 courses and the other for $155 with 8-10 courses.  ( this is without the wine pairing). We, of course were splurging but being penny wise, chose the 5 course.  As the vegetarian, I requested a veggie menu, which they do have. It is typically set up for the $155 menus but they can build you one for the $69 menu.  I started with the amusez bouche of a tomato gelee with an avocado topper.  It was like gazpacho but even better.  Then I was served the split pea soup with a spicy shaving on it and it was so good that  I wanted to lick the bowl. Next came an onion and asparagus tart.  In a word, Yum!  My main course was the truffle and Parmesan spaghetti. It was creamy and decadent. My boyfriend (the meat eater) had the beef cheek as his main and loved it!  In true French style, next came a 3 piece assortment of cheeses ( 1 French and 2 Wisconsin cheeses).  And lastly, the dessert, which was a choice of 5 gelatos or 5 types of tarts. If you are not into a lot of chocolate go with the gelato option.  We had a wonderful gourmand experience and it is worth trying this once, but note your bill will still come out close to $200-250 ( with tax and tip) even if you choose the less expensive option and do not do any alcohol and enjoy one of their two non-alcoholic cocktails instead. Save your pennies for this experience!

Note: It is located near Ka in the MGM, so allow amble time to walk through the hotel to get there.  MGM is huge!
