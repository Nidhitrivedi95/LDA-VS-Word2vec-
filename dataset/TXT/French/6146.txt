41vgh9z4OSJfbgOy57qh0Q I was lucky to have the private dining room (seats 12-14 beautifully) for the Sunday brunch this past week at the brasserie. I hadn't heard from anyone that had been to the restaurant before, but had visited the hotel and restaurant briefly a few weeks prior. And was kind of happy to take a punt given some of the prior yelperonis.

The food was phenomenal. I'm going to say the best Sunday lunch I've had in Scotland. The service was as you would expect from Hiltons WA brand, exceptional, attentive and receptive. The price was in my opinion too reasonable for the quality of the food and service. 

The manager and the hotel managers should be proud of the Brasserie FOH and BOH teams.

I will be back, very soon ...
