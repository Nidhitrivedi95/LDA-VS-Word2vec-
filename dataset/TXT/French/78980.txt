ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug We wanted a nice dinner while we in Vegas but were too lazy to make reservations. 
We wandered around Paris and ended up here. We were seated immediately and were greeted by our amazing server. We ordered our wine and he showed us the special (a 3 course meal for $39). 

I ended up with the filet au poivre and the boy had the special (filet mignon, wedge salad, 2 sides and dessert). We were both very pleased with our meals, the steaks were cooked perfectly and the sides were pitch-perfect. This would be a solid 3 star joint in just about any city... what bumps this one up to a 4 star was our server. He was beyond amazing, he was attentive without being overbearing, he knew the menu and he brought out things without even being asked. It was a lovely way to start our evening.
