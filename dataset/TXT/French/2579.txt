Each dish was great and the wine pairings were right on.  I liked how much information they gave you about the wine, but would have liked more description about the food.  The waitstaff was very though but a little cold at the start.  Didn't explain the menu until after we ordered.  The star was the scallop dish.  It was AMAZING.  My husband and I split up on the main coarse he had the fish and I had the lamb.  The lamb was the winner between the two and the wine pairing was one of my favorite wines.  I was sad to have to share.  The reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is the food offering for the price were not as extensive as other fine dining experiences we had had at Daniel in NY and Inn at Little Washington.   However the setting was over the top.   ENJOY!
