O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q On our second visit to the Palazzo we decided to splash out on our last night in Vegas with dinner at Morels. We turned up in good time for our reservation and were shown to a remote corner of the restaurant with no view, even of the rest of the restaurant. We requested a move which was facilitated but I felt our waiter was unimpressed by our cheek. I was reminded of Steve Martin in LA Story 'Usual table, sir?' 'No, I'd like a good one, please'. However, after this shaky start, things improved greatly. The steaks were magnificent, done exactly to order and accompanied by a very acceptable Pinot Noir preceded by the obligatory Cosmopolitans. The bill, however, for three without dessert, was an eye-watering $350. Special occasions only unless you win big at the tables. Which we hadn't. Should be five stars but only gets four because of the indifferent service and relatively poor value for money.
