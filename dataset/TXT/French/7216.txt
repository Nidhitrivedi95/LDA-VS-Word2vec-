4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I came here after a recommendation from someone in a casino elevator. I was not sure what to expect. It was fantastic. I had gone to Gallagher's last night and the steaks do not  even compare. I had a New York strip that was super tender and cooked perfectly. The warm Brie app was great and the Brussels sprout side was smoke, but tasty. My waiter Sam was attentive and had a very good demeanor. The price is not cheap but well worth it. I almost forgot to mention the Frites are awesome.
