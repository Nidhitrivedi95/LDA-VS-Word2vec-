jaSowNITPRRCYpPb3_pjdA While the rave reviews continue, I remain underwhelmed by my experience here. The service was a little rough, but they had opened only a few weeks prior. The food was only average.

I tried the escargot which were standard, but the baguette that came to the table before hand was wonderful and very nice to soak up the garlic herb butter with. The onion soup au gratin was unremarkable. The salmon entree was bland and could have used some help from a sprinkling of salt. Duck fat fries weren't anything special, but fries are always good. When asked if a shrimp cocktail was possible since they offer a raw bar, it took several trips back and forth to see if they could do so, but in the end they were able to accommodate the request and i appreciated it. It would be helpful to have a raw bar menu so that you could build a seafood platter by mixing and matching. The vegetable terrine, or pate as it might have been called, was one of my favorite things to arrive at the table.

When we sat down, I had asked about a bottle of champagne and recommendations. Little was known about whether or not they had a blanc de blanc or which tended to be more pinot noir heavy. Again, they had only opened for a few weeks, and so I don't blame them for this. I was however, given two different answers which didn't inspire confidence. We also had someone join the table about 30min after we sat down and it was like pulling teeth to get another glass of water, a glass for the champagne, and an order in. The service was a little slow, but to their credit they were very busy that night which is a great sign for business.

I've seen pictures of their beautiful souffles and that alone might be enough to draw me back!
