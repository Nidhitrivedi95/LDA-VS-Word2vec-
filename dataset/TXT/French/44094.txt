MdjIl105vqCYUGKFSUVytA Our company had our party here last Friday. 
The place was pretty and beautifully decorated. The food..... I'm not so sure.....

For starters, there was a seafood platter with smoked salmon, oyster, crab, and shrimp. Whatever radish or anything that was on the oysters was too strong. So i felt that it may not be that fresh. For the shrimp and crab, they were pretty tasteless. 

There was also some corn+edamame, mixed green, and quinoa salad. The butternut squash soup was my favorite.

For the main course was penne, mashed potato, chicken and beef. Seriously if they can't make good pasta they'll be pretty doomed. So.... The pasta was good. Same goes to the mashed potato. But the Chicken was dry and beef was bland, soaked in oil.....

As for dessert.... Since it's a French cafe, they didn't disappoint. The macaroon was sweet as usual..... But the little chocolate cake and tart were good. Later on we also had some yuzu cake (very refreshing), dark chocolate cake, ferrero Rocher cake and blackberry cake. I liked all of them ;)  

Overall it's fair. I'll probably come again but only for the dessert.
