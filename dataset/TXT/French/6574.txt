4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw For my first time there, it was a really nice experience.

Dinner was great, the ambience was so pretty we sat in the window room, even though the doors were open to the outdoor seating we were not cold.  Our service was incredible. I had steak & frites and when I could not decide between the bernaise or the poivre sauce, I was brought both. The steak was very tasty. When I could not decide on a glass of wine a cart was wheeled over and I was given tastes to decide on the right wine for me.

We skipped on dessert this time. But we'll be back for sure!
