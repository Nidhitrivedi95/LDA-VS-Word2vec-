wsbYymWUVBsry9yxeLZc6Q Two brunch selections were vegetarian. One was an omelette but I chose the "monkey bread," which was two huge pieces of slightly toasted, slightly sweet bread over chocolate ganache and berries. For me the proportions were off: too much dry bread and not enough moisture. It needed to be smaller and richer, with some some syrup or egg to make it not so dry. I came away remembering mostly bread. They didn't have soy milk so I got a regular latte instead. The staff was very friendly and helpful, and the space is lovely.
