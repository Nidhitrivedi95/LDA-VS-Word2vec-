fVF5wayDyY6ZR5oJB1IK3g Maybe I expected too much from the very popular restaurant. Visited them for lunch with a friend and was quite surprised at the quality of food. Yes, on the menu it sounded very appetizing and I was so excited to try my food. When I got it, I was surprised at the portion a little bit and the taste. The food itself was very good, but I guess I expected a WOW factor, which I didn't get. It also was quite expensive for lunch ($50/2 people with 2 small dishes each). I might return for brunch since they're so highly praised for it, but not for lunch or dinner.
