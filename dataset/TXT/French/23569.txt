The manager was all over it, though, offered us an amuse and a round of drinks when we sat down. Halfway through the maple syrup beer we had forgotten about the wait. Food was unreal, service was on point, great atmosphere. Manager checked in on us again and got us a round of shots to close the night out. That's how you keep a place going so long.
