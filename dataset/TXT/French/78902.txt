ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug We chose this spot because we wanted to eat something not too quick but also not too expensive. I ordered the Gouda ravioli and it was very good, however, it was cold. What was funny is the waitress was holding the plate with a napkin and advised me that it was very hot.  The staff were pleasant and came back frequently to check on us.
