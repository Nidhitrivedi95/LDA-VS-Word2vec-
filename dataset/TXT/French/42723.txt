LjOBNcNNpuewBqSPxYYTJQ Just ate at Amelie's French Bakery.  My wife and I loved it!  The interior was open and had a nice feel to it.  Overall, the whole place a cool vibe - also, great eclairs!  I experienced no hiccups in service or food (and this was only the second week they have been open).  The place was busy for lunch - but food and service flowed nicely!
Great job, Amelie's!
