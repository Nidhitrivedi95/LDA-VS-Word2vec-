The whole reason we as diners go out to each is to enjoy someone else's food and beverage either by yourself or with a group to share the experience.  Nothing in the food realm jumped out as everything was what it should have been.  However, the service from the start was terrible.  We waited over 30 minutes to place and receive our drinks from the bar.  Followed by another 90 minutes for our entrees.  For a simple turn, this meal did not call for a 2 hour period.  We know the POS system can go down at times, which we think is what happened here, however there was no communication from the FOH to the diners on the holdup.  That aspect needs to be fixed (but understand those things happen).  The highlight of the meal was the libations.  Each of us ordered a different drink but mine was the most memorable.  It was called the "Expat".  A healthy dose of Woodford Reserve with a touch of vanilla extract poured over a circle cube infused w/ ginger syrup.  As you drank (or inhaled) the ice melted and released a complimentary ginger bite that was welcomed while enjoying the Crispy Duck Confit.  This drink is now made weekly in my house as a fantastic wind down to my day and served to guests looking for a way to bring out all the great notes in a Whisky or Bourbon.  Thank you DB for the great idea.
