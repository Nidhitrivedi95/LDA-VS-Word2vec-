UxWH8zRYIBgs6Q2oykvRdw I visited this restaurant recently and sat on the patio. The atmosphere was great and our waiter was very friendly. I ordered a steak that was to be pre-sliced and served with frites. It was absolutely delicious, but unfortunately it wasn't warm. The fact that we were on the patio with a breeze didn't help, nor did the fact that it was already cut, I'm sure. I debated whether I should mention it to the waiter and decided I would. He apologized and retrieved a manager who came out and made it right. He removed the steak from my bill, asked if he could heat it up and thanked me for bringing it to his attention.  Stuff happens. Everywhere. Especially when a restaurant is brand new.  In my opinion, it's really all about how these issues are handled. Well done, Cluny. I'd go back.
