O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q Went there for lunch and I maybe shouldn't have picked the soft shell crab BLTA because it just tasted "meh". Not sure what I was expecting. It wasn't bad, but it's not like the greatest thing on Earth. Surely not $16 or whatever worth. I probably should have picked the mussels or anything else.

On the other hand, the bread was great especially with the whipped butter. Then again, what doesn't butter make better?
