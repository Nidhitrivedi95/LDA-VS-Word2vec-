A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g The macarons from Patisserie Manon may not appear to be delicate or dainty like the ones I've tried from Bouchon, but they're much sweeter and their flavors are apparent. The lemon tastes like lemon. The strawberry tastes like strawberry. The schn...well, you get the point. Whenever I've tried macarons I've always been slightly dissatisfied because the flavors are subtle. I've never traveled to France and eaten a real French macaron before, so I'm unsure if the flavors are supposed to be light, but if I buy one that claims its raspberry flavored, well, it better taste like a raspberry.

GETTIN' MY MAC ON
I purchased 10 macarons, two of each of the following: cherry, raspberry, caramel sea salt, strawberry, and lemon. The cherry, strawberry, and the lemon are my favorites and the most flavorful. The raspberry and the caramel sea salt had lighter flavors, and I was expecting the caramel to be saltier. Just a bit more salt would've created a pleasant sweet and salty flavor. 

OVERALL
$1 a macaron beats paying over $3.00 for one at Bouchon. There are also plenty of flavors. I came here originally for the macarons, and I'll come back for another box and perhaps try one of the ginormous pastries behind the counter that you cannot avoid staring at.
