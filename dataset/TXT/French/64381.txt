tCSlpwJQ4CZsUEMZeH2SFg First time here for breakfast and I'm really impressed.  Excellent service, great atmosphere, generous tasty food.  Sorry I have been missing it for this long.  Started with the beignets and then had a wonderful egg white omelette.  Arrived here 5 minutes before opening and within 10 minutes the place was full of patrons.  Place was packed with a line out the door and still service was excellent.  This place knows what they are doing.
