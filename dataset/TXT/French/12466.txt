4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Not much to add to the already numerous multi-star reviews, but I just want to add that I had an excellent breakfast experience here this morning. We have had lunch overlooking the Bellagio fountains several times: food and service has always been excellent and +5 for location. 

This morning I just wanted a quiet breakfast to quell the after effects of enjoying drinks at Rose.Rabbit.Lie last night. I must have looked like I felt, because I was seated in a quiet corner in an otherwise empty room, far from the "Wheel of Fortune" shouting slot machines in the casino, and received excellent, attentive, smiling, unobtrusive service and the best corned beef hash and poached egg hangover helper ever! Turned my day around and made me happy to be alive again.
