m9aFZk1f8tSv248YErbpQA I have been going to this place since 2013. They have a very small set up and same dishes since then. But the quality of their food is excellent. The place gives you feel of being in France. Even its restrooms are really clean and have French theme. I again visited them in Sep 2017 since I was travelling back to  Phoenix. Again same awesome experience in service and food quality. I really miss my days in Phoenix when I used to be regular at their place for crepes.
