ANHCo9X7zu0LdYecc9fk3Q Epic fail. So I order a sandwich that clearly says it comes with Pesto on it, and instead comes drowned in mayo. So I take it back to the counter, point out the error and they take it back. I hear the manager correcting the staff, who mouths off to him. The manager comes back and says that the fixed sandwich will be right back out. They give me the same sandwich, with all the mayo still on it and a gallon of pink goo which I assume is the tomato Pesto. Not going back again. What a waste.
