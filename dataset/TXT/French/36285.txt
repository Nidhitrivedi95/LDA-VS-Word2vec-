Wish they offered light dessert options to balance the heaviness of their meals. But I suppose "all out heavy" is a thing in Mtl and this place isn't placed at the extreme end of this spectrum anyway. Drinks are ok but nothing special. Nonetheless, very much worth a repeat on the basis of the first two dishes mentioned.
