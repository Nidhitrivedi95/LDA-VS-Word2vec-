4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw We always walked by the restaurant, always wondered how its food was like, always admired those who dined there looking so relax and happy, always wanted to give it a try one day. And we did this time! 
We were there for lunch, requested an outdoor table because the weather was great and the view was good. We were told the wait time was 30 minutes and were given a vibrator to come back later. As we walked away from the restaurant, one of the receptionist called my name and said a table was ready for us now. We were surprised and happy that we did not need to wait. I found this interesting drink on the menu called "Frangria" and ordered a jar. It was like a French-style Sangria and it was good. My sister and mom did not enjoy it much but the drink was great to start my day. We liked the bread they served. It was hot and fresh. We ordered a Prime Rib sandwich, a Chicken and Brie sandwich, and a Seafood Crepe. Prime Rib sandwich was good. Its meat was very tender and juicy. Chicken and Brie was a little sweet, perhaps the sweetness was from the apple slices? I liked my Seafood Crepe. Shrimps and scallops were big, juicy, and cooked to perfection. However, the sauce was a little too plain and they could have put things other than green peas inside the crepe. For each plate, it came with a tiny side salad and I really like the salad dressing. We did not order dessert because our entrees were very fulfilling. I will definitely go back again because this place is perfect for a relaxing morning.
