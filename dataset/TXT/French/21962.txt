bRmb81XDG3E2SOHARBLTog I love the location and the staff and the menu and the patio. But all the food was ho hum. Nothing terrible, but all of it was lacklustre. We tried scallops, poutine, beet salad and crab cakes.  Meh. It felt as if a line cook from TGI Friday was subbing in and doing a decent job of getting food out in time.
