O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q Really recommend trying this place when in Vegas. About the same you would spend on one of the buffets on the strip however the food, the atmosphere and service is way better than you would get at a buffet.  

Highlights of my meal:  CHEESE!!!!! OMG order somebody their specialty cheeses.  The come with bread and honeycomb and walnut preserves. To die for.  The tartare was out of this world and the watermelon salad fantastic. My salmon was cooked to perfection.

Quiet, refined, great and attentive service. Really a great find for the price. And if you get the summer tasting menu partner with a cheese course you will be stuffed, but deliciously so!
