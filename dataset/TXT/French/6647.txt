4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw We went here for our breakfast for the first time. Make sure you request to seat outside because they are right across from Belagio so you get to enjoy the water show and your meal together. What a bonus!!! 

I ordered a dozen oyster to split with my friend. It was pretty fresh. I also have coffee with my salmon Benedict. Their coffee was really good not water down at all. 

My friend had their crepe and it was delicious too. 

Service was great and food was good too. I defiantly will find myself back here again when I'm in Vegas.
