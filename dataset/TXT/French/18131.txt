My husband ordered a raspberry chocolate fruit tart which he did not really like either because he said the chocolate was too overpowering meaning there was too much of it. but most importantly I was not happy with the service. The girl in the front looked like she really did not enjoy her job and did not smile once. I will not be coming back. The only reason I gave this place 2 stars is because their baguette was good.
