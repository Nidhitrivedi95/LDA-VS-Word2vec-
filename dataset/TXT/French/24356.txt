cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg I've been here twice, Memorial Days 2012 and 2013, and it's definitely a place you don't need to go to more than once a year. They don't do balance here - just about everything on the menu is a celebration of richness, fat and decadence, so the key is to order strategically so you don't get overwhelmed.

Though you're probably going here for pork/duck/foie, I highly recommend the PDC raw bar platter, a fantastic spread of fresh oysters, clams, escargot, crab salad, etc, etc. This massive platter (the smallest of several offered!) could easily serve as appetizer for a table of 6-8 and is a relative bargain at $60. (I had it with a party of two others and was stuffed by the time the entrees came!) What's particularly great about it is the brininess of the seafood that serves to complement all the goose and pig fat you'll be eating later. For that reason, the endive salad is also a fine choice.

The namesake pied de cochon is a huge, delicious trotter smothered in a sauce flavored with mustard and vegetables. The meat itself is blanketed by a thick layer of skin and fat, which you can nibble on sparingly while going for the falling-apart flesh underneath.

Foie gras poutine smothered in the richest gravy and a generous number of lobes is delicious for two or three bites until it begins to overwhelm. Get one for the table, or make someone else order this and eat off their plate.

Also order the side of vegetable. On the night we came it was a delicious serving of spring asparagus and fiddleheads, simply prepared, that was instrumental in combating overrichness.

I was a tiny bit underwhelmed by both duck in a can and duck magret with mushroom sauce. Would probably stick to pig in future trips.

The decor is classic French bistro with subway tile, dark woods and a sizeable bar and impressive glass wine room you can admire from the dining room. No wines by the glass, so it's bottles or beers. Make reservations well in advance.
