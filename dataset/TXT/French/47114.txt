O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q Pleasantly average. It's hard to say anything truly bad about Morel's. The service is pleasant, the view of the Strip is serviceable (much better at night because it's right across the pirate show at Treasure Island), and the food very reasonably priced for Palazzo standards (lunch for 2 with 2 drinks each is only 100). The problem is that Morel's does nothing to distinguish itself from the overcrowded bistro market in Vegas. Even in the Palazzo/Venetian it's going up against Bouchon and Pinot Brassiere, not t speak of the other bistros all around the strip (Payard, Mon Ami Gabi.. the list goes on). As a result the restaurant is almost always empty: the last time I was here for brunch there were only 6 more guests in the patio and none inside. For a restaurant that does much OK (service, food, prices) it's hard to write a good review because it is just fine in all categories but superb in none. If you are at the Palazzo for lunch you could certainly do a lot worse but be assured that you could do much better within only a 10 minute walking distance. You won't be disappointed with your meal but you probably won't remember it the next day either.
