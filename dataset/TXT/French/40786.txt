kcF-en40P3J9L8nLy5lKqQ We had great food, fun music, and great service.  I had the corn pancakes with blueberries, and a cup of coffee.  I was so happy....and the people with me were happy with their breakfast orders as well.  The music was nice in a Flight of the Conchords sort of way..but not as funny...just nice.  
Admittedly, I went there because the Henry was tooooo full and a total zoo.  'So glad I did.
