d482l58ho0_IMdFkXX1F5Q Do yourself a favor and remove this restaurant from your list!  By comparison, the former DB Brasserie in the Wynn was far superior to the new DB Brasserie in the Venetian. This version was bland and lacked personality.  Unless you are into stuffy, unattentive servers from France, then skip DB Brasserie.  I would be willing to bet that they won't make it to their second anniversary.
