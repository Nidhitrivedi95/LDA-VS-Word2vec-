We ordered the bacon streak appetizer to start.  Wow...I've never seen bacon cut that thick, it was perfectly juicy and had fabulous little flavor sauces around the plate.
Next we had fois gras...never have I had fois melt in my mouth like this.  Never.  It was explained to us that this dish is prepared differently every time, depending on the ingredients the chef had and creative mood he was in...he had to have outdone himself that evening!!!  Muah, the best!  
When our server found out we had just gotten married, she brought us a glass of French champagne on the house...later, we were given another glass of French wine...I can't remember the name, but the host gave a great long description of how long it takes to harvest and how very particular the wine it, I truly enjoyed it!
Our premier meal was filet-thick cut, incredibly juicy, just perfection...it's not the cheapest place, but we will be back in a heartbeat...or after our next paycheck.
