4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Service AND food is amazing. Staff went out of their way to accommodate our 2 straggling guests. We were seated outside on the patio in a premium location. Our server made us comfortable while we waited for the stragglers (we did have reservations on Sunday-an off night for this establishment.) Specials included The Wellington (holy sh*t ballz this was amazing) and butternut squash soup. My mom tried the soup and I had a taste and it -- was PURE PERFECTION just like the french onion soup. 
Our party of six all ordered the ribeye (except me I got the amazing Wellington) and two ordered rare. We had rare snobs at the table and they actually were blown away at how good the meat was prepared (these people just want the meat to hit the grill for 2 seconds and call it cooked so...)
Mom and Dad blown away at this fine dining experience. You pay the prices because you are getting top notch service AND french cuisine. 

P.S.-The banana foster and classic profiteroles (my fav) are so good you will want to save room!

I love this restaurant. This review was based of of my third experience however the previous two experiences were just as pleasant! Try Vouvre with your meal as well -- won't be disappointed!
