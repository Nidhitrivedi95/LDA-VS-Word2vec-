or4UVDjXEEjze3wNPjoAZA We have eaten as Zinc several times with a consistent amazing experience.  We enjoyed oysters, crepes, flat iron steak and frittes in our last visit.  All were well prepared and very tasty.  We closed out our meal with the choc souffle and were pleasantlysurprised by the best bottle of red wine I have had in years.   Sean the bartender took care of us.  A great experience and one of my favorite stops for thies foodee.
