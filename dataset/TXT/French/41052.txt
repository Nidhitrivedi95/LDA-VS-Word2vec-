kcF-en40P3J9L8nLy5lKqQ Can't speak for dinner, have only been here for social hour and bruch. But, divine pizzas (better than Bianco), with inventive toppings like emulsified balsamic vinegar with melon and proscuitto. Great articokes when in season and a very tasty (and potent) apple martini. 

Great design. Nice bar. A bit of a big city feel that makes you forget you are in Phx.  

Very good stuffed french toast for brunch, but omelete was just so-so.
