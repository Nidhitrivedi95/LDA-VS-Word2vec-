jSfnItqaOnEp2nenVF7fCg The 4 of us had dinner one night. With tip it was about 85.

Pros:
The food quality was excellent
The service was great
The bread was delicious

Cons:
This is a byob restaurant and there is a corking fee
The portions could be bigger. My father and law and I had the meatloaf and while it was great, for $15, I expected more than 2 pieces on a small bed of mashed potatoes.
