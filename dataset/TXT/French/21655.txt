bEVWHtBRYVwqaaNF4mWNYg I was sure I had already wrote a review of this place and now it sucks because I can not remember the details.

Great steak, that is the one thing I did remember.

The only thing I did not like was the small room we were crammed into for eating but that was my friend's choice. 

The other section to this place has a more casual feeling and is more noisy so it is kind of cool how this place attracts people for different reasons.
