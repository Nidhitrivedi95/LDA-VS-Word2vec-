ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug Food was phenomenal! We had calamari and three grilled steaks.

Calamari was seasoned to perfection. Tasty Crisp light batter and ample portions! The homemade marinara sauce was delicious and had lots of garlic and spice.

Grilled steaks were cooked to perfection and melted in your mouth. So tender you could have cut it with a fork.

Jorge was the star of the show! Great server, attentive, knowledge, kind and fast! Gave great recommendations! 

Here is the sour part, Santiago however, had a terrible terrible attitude. When he delivered the bread he literally threw the plate on the table. Extremely rude! 

If it were not for santiago I would have rated this fine establishment 5 stars!
