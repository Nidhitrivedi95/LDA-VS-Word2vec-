gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA Awesome experience at Alize!  Food here is definitely pricey but the night view from the restaurant is amazing.  I was lucky enough to get a corner table that was super private next to the window.  Not only did I enjoy the delicious food but I could pair it with a panoramic view of the Vegas skyline.  The meal started off with two amuse bouche's from the chef.  I ordered the mushroom crusted filet mignon at medium well.  It was a bit dry and overcooked but the flavor was delicious.  For dessert, I took advantage of Yelp's check in offer of a free soufflé with an entree order.  They had three soufflé options to choose from and I picked the chocolate soufflé.  The soufflé was so light and not too sweet as long as you avoided the sauce that they poured in the middle of it.  Great experience from the food to the one on one service to the cool view of the city at night!
