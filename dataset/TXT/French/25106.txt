Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA I visited Mix with a friend of mine, for cocktails and a light dinner. My friend in particular likes this place because they have a nice happy hour until sunset, a complimentary glass of champagne at sunset, and good food. The drinks we had were pretty good and strong. 

We had tacos and a flatbread, which were both excellent. I will say though, flatbread is a bit on the messy side for eating in a lounge. I'd probably choose something else. I can't comment on the club aspect of MIX, because we left after eating, but it seems like it might be a little on the small side if you're looking to dance. For drinks though, it's just right.
