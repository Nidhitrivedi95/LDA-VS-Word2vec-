ysJo5Jdo29XOBCnKrbUKWg A strong 3 stars. 

The room looks like a parisian brasserie, and in my book that's really a plus. It is quite nice to feel home, for a change. In contrast to many other yelp reviewers, i found the service perfect - helpful, attentive, but not overbearing. The waitress was very accommodating.

My food was good, but not top notch. The snails were tender, buttery and garlicky. The way they are supposed to be. The boeuf bourguignon was good, although not nearly as good as the one I do (true, i do an amazing bourguignon). So fine, perhaps 4 star if I was just rating quality, but not succulent. Also, it was a bit too salty. (What's wrong Pittsburgh with salt? Cure was also way too salty!!)

That said, around the table, others seemd much less happy with their food. And, the price just isn't right: it's too expensive ($29 for the bourguignon) for the quality of the food.
