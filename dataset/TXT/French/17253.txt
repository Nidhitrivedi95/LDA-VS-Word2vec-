Service:  Sub-par

I had heard so many good things about this place so I was really looking forward to going for my birthday.  I ordered the filet and my husband ordered the chicken cordon bleu.  They bring out the meals, oops, the server brought out two filets.  What happened to the chicken cordon bleu?  The server misheard what my husband ordered and got the order wrong.  Then she proceeds to say, sorry they are OUT of the chicken cordon bleu.  Okay, disappointing but he orders the salmon dish.  In the mean time he shares my meal with me.  I really hate it when this happens.  They bring out his salmon only to find that it is raw and cold on the inside.  Once again we have to send his dish back.  Finally, a new plate arrives.  It is cooked perfectly and is delicious, as was my meal.  It just took forever to get it right.  The owner came to the table and apologized, which we appreciated, but rather than comp my husband's meal, he offers a free dessert.  I guess something is better than nothing but I really felt that our situation called for my husband's dish to be at no cost to us.   

So the food was great, everything I expected, but getting the order RIGHT was challenging.
