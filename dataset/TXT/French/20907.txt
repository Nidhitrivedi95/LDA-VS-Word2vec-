AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw Upon staying at  Casar's for the recent Blackhat convention,  I stumble upon this patisserie.  Everything there looked yummy...I felt like a kid in a candy store and was contracting diabetes just by looking at the gelate and chocolate displays.

It was breakfast time and I order the egg sandwich and a small chai latte, totalling $16.  Pretty steep for a simple sandwich and latte, but it was pretty damn good.  The egg sandwich was comprised of a scrambled egg with couple slices of bacon and some Béchamel sauce on a toasted ciabatta bread.  It was one of the best egg sandwiches I've tasted.  Prices are steep, but what can you expect of Vegas these days....simple food is turning out to be over-priced.
