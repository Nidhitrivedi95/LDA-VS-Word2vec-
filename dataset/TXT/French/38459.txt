JJ1Ruu37kn66YSWUmCKNCw I love this restaurant.  Its modern and classy decor.  This is a nice romantic dinner date or a good place to bring a small group of friends. You bring your own bottle of wine.  The mussels are yummy and that's all I go for.  All the flavors are good.  I usually like the white creamy cheese soup one- Rockafello and comes with yummy fries to dip. They're known for the mussels.  Wednesdays are half off mussels ($13) fyi!
