kcF-en40P3J9L8nLy5lKqQ We invited friends to join us at one of our favorite neighborhood restaurants, Central Bistro.  Unfortunately, our dinners were bland and tasteless.  The garden risotto had no flavor and was just mushy.  The mac and cheese dish was in a heavy sauce and just inedible.  The trout was dry.  The flourless chocolate cake was dry and cold, just awful.  We do not know what happened to this place?  We have enjoyed over a dozen good dining experiences, but will not return with four bad meals served at one time, plus a lousy dry piece of chocolate cake. Ugh!  The only redeeming dessert was the apple tart. We have enjoyed many meals at this establishment and am curious as to what has happened in such a short period of time.  Did the chef quit? Had we known the chef was gone that evening, we would have stopped after appetizers, that were just ok, and finished our nice bottle of wine without dinner.
