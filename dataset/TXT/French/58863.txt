Service was terrific and prompt.  Table next to us had a wedding proposal and a show to go to, and they accommodated all of those needs.

Atmosphere has a circus/happy monkey theme.   I liked it; some may not.  Some of the views oversee the fountains.

We had the tasting menu.   Overall, very good, not totally out of this world, but very good.  Some great stuff - Risotto with truffle, foie gras.  The cut of beef was  a little gristly.  The desserts (they brought one for each tasting) was terrific without being too experimental and the pre-dessert palate cleanser (raspberry sorbet with grapefruit?) was really terrific.  Petit fours that came with the check were high quality. They give truffles at the end, but in a little cardboard chest drawer - pretty neat.   I almost enjoyed the desserts the most.

Kind of expensive.

Just be sure the smoke isn't too strong for you before you go.  Michael Mina and Picasso (in the same hotel) are further away from the Casino and more smoke free.
