10cjlsUzS8rAKMjdEWbxvA Bivy is truly a gem in the Toronto brunch scene. I used to live a block away from Bivy and it literally was one of my top highlights of living in that neighbourhood. It is so good!

First and foremost - I really dislike brunch. Something about paying $20 for a couple of eggs and potatoes drives me nuts. But Bivy was a game-changer for me when I discovered it 2 years ago - and still insist on travelling on the weekends to go back there today! Do yourself a favour and go.

- Intimate but not crowded
- Rarely a wait
- Generous portion sizes
- I almost always order the Ploughman Platter, but have ordered their salads in the past (Farmer Salad) and was not disappointed
- I bring all my friends and guests here - many of whom ordered their Croque Monsier and raved about this plate
- Great prices

You won't regret it.


Update:

I'm not sure what happened on a recent Saturday brunch visit (March 2016). I had talked up this place to a couple of girlfriends, and convinced them to trek a little farther outside of our usual stomping grounds to meet at Bivy. Holy moly. Everything I've known about this place was flipped upside down.

- Unbearably cold in the space. Teeth chattering.
- My beloved Ploughman Platter that has been consistent for years came out so different than usual. No pate/terrine, flimsy toast, canned(?) sliced ridged pickles - what happened here!?
- My friend's Croque Monsieur (also a usual fan fave) was so salty

Service was also slow and unattentive this afternoon.
I really hope this was an off day for them. I usually see the gentleman who I believe owns the restaurant working in the kitchen, and he wasn't there this day. Coincidence?
