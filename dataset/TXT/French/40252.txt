KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA Visited Marche Bacchus with my mother for a special lunch, and sadly was VERY disappointed.  The 2 stars is for the environment, which is very lovely, and the food which is solid.  The big issue with this restaurant is the service.  I had called the day before to make reservations, with a special request for a customized wine tasting.  When we arrived I reminded them that we wanted a customized flight.  There were no notes on our reservation, and apparently the guy that handles those requests was not there.  We were asked if we could wait 10-15 minutes, and he would arrive and speak with us about what we wanted. No problem!  But...alas, he never came to our table.  Meanwhile, after multiple conversations with a couple of the staff members there, this small request became a big deal.  Finally our waitress mentions that we could choose our own wines for a 2 oz flight from a limited list of wines.  WHAT?!?!  That's what we wanted.  What is wrong with this picture?  I said that was great, and we wanted the wine before or with lunch....not after.  Well, lunch was served, and no wine.  It took so darn long, that I had to get up in the middle of eating and find out what was going on.  It was very stressful.  We finally got the wine, but the whole experienced was soured by that point.  Just really ridiculous for a place whose business centers around wine.
