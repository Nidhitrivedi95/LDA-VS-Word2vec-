or4UVDjXEEjze3wNPjoAZA I was contemplating dining here versus another restaurant a block away. The other restaurant's prices were comparable, but served Californian cuisine. Having lived there a few years, I opted for the French style fare instead. 

Shared a bottle of Wild Rock Pinot Noir, great value for the price. Tried the scallops, which were cooked perfectly. Shared some sides including the mac and cheese, asparagus, truffle fries and haricots verts. Can't remember what I had for dessert but do remember it was fudge-like.

Service was great. Atmosphere was cozy. It was a nice, slow European style meal. I'd definitely come back.
