4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Pretty good food with a great view of the Vegas strip and the Bellagio fountains.  Came here for brunch on the morning my friends got to Vegas.  We came in thinking there'd be a wait around 11:30am, but they surprisingly had seats open.  The food here is moderately expensive, but the food is fair for the price.  I had the blueberry waffles and a side of bacon.  Both were excellent.  The waffles here are a lot different from what I have had before.  They're very airy and light and are full of vanilla flavor.  It was great with the blueberries.  Overall a great experience, and if you eat on the patio, you get an awesome view.
