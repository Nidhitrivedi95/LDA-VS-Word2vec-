c8j5MQqlb0RhgS_bpxMDuA I went here for a hangover brunch with 4 friends after a bachelor party.  We were pleasantly surprised by the amazing patio (on a 75 degree day).  The fresh and diverse menu was the perfect complement to the traditional bistro feel.  I had the grilled salmon, served on top of a vibrant spinach salad, and it was great.  The only thing that wasn't great was the wait - at least an hour.  Our waiter was very friendly though, and all the staff in general were very congenial.  Definitely go here on a nice day and order some appetizers!
