O3OH5IEFMPtz7mPKakPZ3Q Came in for lunch with my wife and a handful of good friends. We were all curious to see how they transformed the former Volcano Grille into Japaneiro. The decor was really cool. The place had the same look it did before, but very much upgraded. Japaneiro seemed to have put a lot of thought into the added design. It turned out great! The atmosphere was nice for a date and fun for a group of friends. Though the decor was nice, the food is why I will be coming back. From their Jidori chicken to their certified Angus Bone in Ribeye, there is definitely quality there. Oh, and let's not forget their Chilean sea bass! That was my favorite, I loved the clean flavor of the fish and the subtle flavor of the sauce that accompanied the fish. Quality seems to be the passion of this place. If that's something you care about, this place is definitely worth checking out. An easy 5 stars.
