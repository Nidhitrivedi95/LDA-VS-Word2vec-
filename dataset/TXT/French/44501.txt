MhFoFpLBx_Fy8gs9dlwtGA I think this is my first 5 stars given to anyone on here so this is an accomplishment!  I didn't know what to expect when I got here as we were there with friends as part of a celebration.  We were greeted warmly at the door and shown to where our friends were at a corner table in the back of the large dining room (there is a smaller room with a bar when you enter).

The menu is basically written on a blackboard with several appetizer, main entree and dessert choices listed.  You can order a la carte or I believe they offer a prixe fixe option for about $35 with an appetizer, main entree and dessert (excellent value).

After ordering, they brought over several baskets of bread and that's where they got me!  The bread was as good, if not better, than what you would get in France!!  Even some of our dining companions who were from France agreed and we quickly finished the baskets before more came.  I had a salad with goat cheese that was incredibly tasty and not too rich (the cheese was warmed a bit so it melted and added an extra layer of richness).  Most of the table ordered steak with fries and none of us were disappointed----order it medium rare even if you don't normally (like me) as you won't be disappointed.  Save room for dessert as I was able to order a (seasonal) rhubarb tarte that had the perfect mix of sweet to tart.  

The wine list is extensive and even though I'm from California, I was blown away by the CA Cabernet that we drank which I had never seen/tasted before (now if only I could remember the name....).  Service was excellent----friendly and accommodating especially considering that there were several other groups of 6 or more dining that night.  I think that the next time I want to go to France, I'd rather come up here to Montreal as the food was comparable and you actually get warm, friendly service too!  A must try if you're in the area and can afford it.
