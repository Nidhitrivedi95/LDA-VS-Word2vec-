jLxeBgWhLRbII2ACkgH1Sg Growing up in Europe, I was spoiled with great pastries. After moving to Vegas, I thought I'd have to buy a plane ticket back to Europe to ever experience drool-worthy pastries again. THEN... I found this bakery. I came here with a couple of hours to kill in between job interviews. I told the gentleman behind the counter that it was my first time ever being there and if he could recommend anything. He laughed and said, "Just about anything." 

I had seen the reviews on the danishes so I opted for a Cheese Danish and an Almond Croissant along with a Hot Chocolate. My first bite of the Cheese Danish was heaven. It was flaky and warm but had that delicious cheese center that I had been craving for YEARS. No joke - I wolfed that bad boy down. The Hot Chocolate was delicious. It was a bit on the thick and rich side - just how I like it. I saved the Almond Croissant for later (to eat wth my family with afternoon coffee). It was generously packed with the delicious almond filling and the almond slivers on top were far from sparse. The fact that I had to split it with my family made me bitter (lol) and made me wished I had bought more. 

The bakery had plenty of room for seating - both inside and out. It was clean and I encountered only friendly, smiling faces while there.

I will definitely be back to try more on the menu (which is quite extensive) and to try some of the bread that I've heard so much about. I absolutely can't wait!
