_T7f2wUgNlJqxsR-cR89SQ Two words- blown away. The food, the staff, the ambience... You pay for the experience here.

We came on a Friday night (surprised there was still availabilities left last minute). Service was a bit slow, but reasonable considering it was a Friday night and the place was packed. Every dish we ordered was amazing. I loved the venison; my bf loved the lamb. Highly recommend those dishes.

The star of the show however was the coconut cream pie. They aren't kidding when they say it's one of the best desserts in the city!

Perfect spot for a date, if you're willing to splurge a night. Tip: ask to be seating near the window. The view of Toronto is amazing!
