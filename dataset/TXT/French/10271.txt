4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Fun, lively, always busy,  yet serious restaurant.  Great service and view of the Belagio fountains from the patio bar.  We enjoyed some wine with the fruit & cheese platter, along with a fresh, warm baguette (its a meal for 2 on its own), followed by a glass of port and creme brulee.  It was so perfect, we went back and did a repeat the next evening!  We will return every time we go to Vegas!
