HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw This was the biggest disappointment of a stay at the Cosmopolitan. For a $200+ meal we received rushed and entitled service with a 30 minute delay on a reservation. Three food entrees were tasteless, which only added to the incredibly small portions. All beef entrees and items were not available "chef is out of beef" This establishment does not earn its location and reputation.
