BXx77WXfoAQaJnQuHquhCw Went here today because I had walked by it before and it looked so damn cute. What seems to me to be a very european style cafe, I throughly enjoyed my Szechwan chicken pressed sandwich. The broccoli soup was so so, but I saw some french onion and was drooling. They have a bunch of fresh baked breads and a ready made "to go" cooler. You can also order stuff to go. However, they also have sit down service and the outdoor patio looked very inviting on a cool summer day. Nice music playing in the background gave great ambiance and the dessert/pastry case looked delicious. I'll be going back for a more in-depth look.

**One new note....I'm 24 and the average age of most people here was between 50-60....but I don't care. It was still neat.
