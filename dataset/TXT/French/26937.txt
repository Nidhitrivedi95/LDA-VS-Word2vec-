Dcj69NZJnbJhK-YHP_nULA When I was a young El, I often confused "brassiere" with "brasserie", but there's nothing but the breast, ahem, best served at Brasserie V.  Is that a letter or a roman numeral? Never mind. 
The only thing that could get me to ignore the frites with my sandwich was the lentils (and my faux attempt at healthy choices). Holy shit, those were good lentils. Cool, delicious, and with just a note of moral superiority. Exactly how I like 'em.

But yeah, if lentils aren't available, fuck the salad, imma eat my increasing weight in frites.
