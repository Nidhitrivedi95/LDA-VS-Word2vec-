A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g I don't give out 5 stars out very often.  I adore this place and the staff are always very friendly here.  I love their hours of business and I can always count on them for a special treat to myself.  Who the heck does beef bourguinon on the menu at a reasonable price! =)  thank you Manon for being my favorite bakery in Vegas!
