ME6D5nLlfG0xZCtICOYDuw Me and my friends enjoyed brunch at George's Brasserie in Charlotte, NC.  We started with oysters and then ordered eggs Oscar, along with a plate of French toast.  Of course, we all enjoyed bottomless mimosas.  

Our waitress Brittain was super.  She kept our glasses full and was very attentive.  

The atmosphere was quiet and comfortable.  Most everybody was dressed in their Sunday best, but I believe nice jeans would be fine.  I enjoyed being able to talk without speaking loudly.

Sunday brunch starts at noon, and you might want yo make reservations for groups larger than four people.
