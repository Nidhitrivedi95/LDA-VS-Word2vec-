USleI8g1UVN9-9jm-b4uIg I have seen The Fig Tree Restaurant for years and was curious about trying the food.
It is pricey, but when I saw that elk and escargot were served I had to try it. I like wild game and trying new foods. Although I have had both before.

I had the elk cooked medium; it was tender and flavorful. It was served with cabbage and potato gratin. At first, I was not sure about how the flavors came together, but as I ate it more they complimented each other well. 
Good wine selection.
The escargots was prepared differently from how I had them on a cruise once before. With the way they were prepared here, I was able to taste the flavor of the snail. It was chewy (like calamari) and good; to me there was a slight citrus taste. Not sure if I can compare the taste of it to anything. 

For desert, I had the bananas foster cheese cake. That was good!

I had a good experience at Fig Tree.The service was good and you are welcome to take a look upstairs; liked the interior of the house. Built in 1913, I tried to imagine what 1913 Charlotte was like!
This neighborhood reminds me of East Nashville.
