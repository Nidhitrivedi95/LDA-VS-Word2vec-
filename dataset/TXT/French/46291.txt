N0Tk9ORpX-gtbPNR0WoznQ Neighbourhood gem! Was really surprised as we pulled up in front of this place as it felt a little bit out of nowhere, but once you step inside the warm ambiance sets the tone to a great evening of wine and dining. 

Excellent service as they make sure to settle you in by serving you a small amuse bouche and opening your bottle as soon as you are seated. Varied menu to please all kinds of pallets; classic restaurant items that never leave the list such as rack of lamb and deer as well as market fresh ingredients for their dishes of the day to mix things up. 
All excellently executed from start to finish. Don't skip out on dessert as they are delicious! 

For those who have a bigger appetite they also offer 5 to 7 course tasting menus that changes with the chefs inspiration! 

Tip: Call in advance as this place gets booked up quite fast and bring a good bottle of wine as the food will not disappoint!
