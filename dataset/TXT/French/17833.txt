9ot8oInkYZTt6wkkGe__vQ Took my wife for her birthday since she loves French food. Very high end but not pretentious. If you are young and casual it wouldn't be the place for you. I would say it is formal, tie off kind of place. Atmosphere was nice, not loud. The food was great but I have had better French cuisine in Toronto. The wife loved the food though and it was her opinion that counted. Service was excellent and personable. The hostess was fantastic. It was busy on a Monday. I would recommend definitely.
