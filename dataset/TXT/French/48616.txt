ohMpNug5zWNxOlL6ShG7Ig We checked this place out this morning for brunch after enjoying a delicious dinner at Binkley's a few months ago.  We sat on the patio and enjoyed the beautiful view of the mountains.  The eggs benedict was delicious - everything made fresh...even the english muffins.  The dressing on the greens was so tasty too!  Nice patio, friendly service and great food!
