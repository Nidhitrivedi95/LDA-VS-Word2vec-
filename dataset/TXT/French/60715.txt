SCklYa_jhihWAcfIn-_chg I really wanted to like this place but sadly I can't.

I dined in once & ordered take out three times.  I can say with certainty that service is consistent.  It's horrid.  I expected to wait as this place is always busy.  I just didn't expect the attitude - at least treat your customers like you want them to be here.

When I ordered take out, I'm ignored me in favour of people behind me. I was a little taken aback the first time and thought maybe I wasn't standing in the proper place.  The second and third time?

When I dined in I was expecting to have a nice, relaxed lunch with a friend.  My soup was barely warm when served.  I was willing to let it pass but thought I should mention it to the waitstaff so they would know.  She acted offended and stayed that way for the rest of our meal. 

It's a shame really as I enjoyed (most of) the food but hate the service.
