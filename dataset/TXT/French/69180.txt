w2tr0PA0b3tg8pId0kjM-A This a great place for a special date or to take someone from out of town. It's right across the street from Coffee Tree Roasters, which has fantastic coffee. 
The pastries are really good----the macarons are TO DIE FOR and they put your baked goods in cute fancy boxes. The service was great, and the place is pretty sophisticated. I'd give it 4 stars---maybe even five, but for $2.25 a pop for a tiny cookie I'll leave it at 3.
