q0n4I-zqiI47xispOqc1lA This little cafe is perfect for a quick brunch! We ordered the berries toast with vanilla cream, the apple & brie crepe, a caprese bagel sandwich and chai lattes. I would not order the french toast again, just because it was a little too sweet for me. The chai lattes were served in a little mason jars, and they were good but could have been hotter. Everything else was delicious, especially the bagel sandwich. The staff was very kind and the food came out quickly. I will definitely go back to try more food from their extensive menu!
