4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Not sure why all the high reviews. Food was very meh. The Gabi poutine was subpar, with dry fries and congealed cheese. The blueberry French toast was tasty but not exceptional. 

Service was really great though. We loved our server. 

Great view of the Bellagio fountain if you are seated on the patio.
