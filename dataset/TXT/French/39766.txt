K2C8dSx9215LLcIzHL959Q Is this the best meal I've had in Pittsburgh? Very possibly.  Chef Andrew Garbarino's Twisted Frenchman is a great "find" in Pittsburgh.  A passionate chef with a heart for French and Northern Italian cuisine, coupled with that solid C.I.A. training, and vision and soul to create magnificent dishes from locally sourced ingredients.  His pheasant consommé (the inspiration was Paul Bocuse's truffle soup) served with smoldering hay on the side just to add an olfactory sensation from his youth, was "sensational" and I would get that dish every time I dine here in the future.  Speaking of truffles, this is the season and the Chef incorporates them into the dishes as appropriate.

Our party of four had the fish and chips (delicate and refined), the tartare (a very harmonious dish that incorporated foie gras and truffles), agnolotti (wonderful combination of delicate herbs with truffles), oysters, petite poussin (very delicately prepared, again with some truffles), USDA Prime strip steak, and salmon.  Everything was outstanding excellent.  One of the things I ask fiends when we dine out is "what dish did you like the least," and we all agreed we loved everything and would easily order the same dishes.  

The Chef uses liquid nitrogen in preparing some of the cocktails, as well as the dessert he prepared tableside for us...quite impressive and I don't want to spoil it if you order dessert.

This is a small, manageably-sized, restaurant where the Chef can really give each diner the attention they deserve.  His mastery of the latest cooking technologies (we did a kitchen tour afterwards) enables him to create magnificent, natural, amazing taste sensations that you'll want to come back for. His staff is as knowledgeable, capable, and friendly, as you'll find in any great restaurant.
