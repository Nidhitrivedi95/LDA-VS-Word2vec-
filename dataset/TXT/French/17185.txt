9ETbjlbD52Q6PKXjIcTqUA First time eating here yesterday. The service was good, polite and willing to please. I had the chicken sandwich my friend had the cafe salad. My sandwich tasted good, the bread and fixings were fresh. But, It's over priced for what you get. Your paying for fancy plates and cloth napkins.
