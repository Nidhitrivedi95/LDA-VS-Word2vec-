hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA WHO: Anyone you want to take on a lunch date ;) *nudge nudge

WHEN: Monday through Friday from 7am-5pm.

WHERE: On Sunset & Durango, close to the corporate buildings.

WHY: For their tasty French baguettes.

WHAT: My best friend and I decided we needed to have lunch. And since I had heard such great reviews about this place, we decided to go and try it out.

First thing's first, I love Olivier!! Anything he said, I believed! And because he said the Yellow Curry baguette was one I should try, TRY is what I did. And yes, Olivier does it again! Such a great sandwich, with a touch of spice, and a cup of tomato basil soup... This had to be the best lunch I've ever had!

Olivier charmed my friend into trying the Moroccan baguette (which I will have to try next time), and she also fell in love with how well-made the sandwich was.

For dessert, we tried the newly made Peach Tart, which was UHHMAAYYYZIINNNGGGG! It was not too sweet, and just the right amount for both of us.

I'd love to go back and try some of their other baguettes and pastries SOONER THAN LATER. In the meantime, check it out for brunch & tell me how much you LOVE the yellow curry baguette 8).
