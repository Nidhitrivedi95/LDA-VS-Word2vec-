4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Great Sunday morning breakfast. 

We normally like going to the Paris buffet but with the cost for sunday brunch around $30 now we thought our money was better spent on smaller cheaper dishes. We got there around 9:30ish and got seated outside right away. Not 10 minutes later there was a line waiting for tables outside.

We shared the cornbeef hash with poached eggs, which was very good, but having it served in a bowl-ish pooled up the oil in the dish. The wife got the bacon/chocolate waffles which is by far more tasty than a crepe. Served with syrup, fresh whip cream, and chocolate sauce.

All very tasty and all for around 1 entrance into the buffet.
