4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Little more than a restaurant that masks itself as a French restaurant but in reality is little more than French-ish cafeteria food. Good cafeteria food it may be, but calling it a French restaurant is generous. A friend and I both had different steaks that, for the price, I expected to be quite good. Instead, our cuts of meat were both mediocre quality and the "red wine reduction" I had with mine, resembled au jus more than a reduction. Would not recommend this place if you're used to real French food.
