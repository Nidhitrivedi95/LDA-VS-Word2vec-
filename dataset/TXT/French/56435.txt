rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Classy but not pretentious, pricey but not over the top, casual ambiance with undoubted refinement; all the makings of what I consider to be a perfect spot for dinner. 

This is the exact type of restaurant I look for when I want to go out and have a nice dinner. I love nice places but I don't really care for any uptight atmosphere, I just want to be comfortable and have great food. If you know of somewhere like this in L.A. please tell me about it!

Its true that the food was not absolutely spectacular (my lamb was well cooked but a little bit too salty), but my party and I enjoyed everything. The fact that they had Delerium Tremens on tap was totally awesome. The service was courteous but the food did come out a little slow. 

The next time I'm in Vegas I will definitely go back.
