Overall, we said: "The elephant-memoried among you will remember that I was not a fan of their sister restaurant, L'Escargot Bleu, on my visit. The reservations I had about Bleu were not in evidence here, and I thought Blanc an absolute delight. This is in no small measure down to the service, which was beyond friendly and much like being invited in to the home of a treasured family member. Without question, I'll be back to sample further dishes from their ever-changing menu."
