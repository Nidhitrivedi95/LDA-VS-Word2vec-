rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I read so many great things about Bouchon and was so excited to try it for brunch. I am so sad that it did not live up to its reviews. 

I expected a long wait, but surprised that we only waited 10 minutes for a table. I think that was the only good thing about my experience, besides the beautiful view of the gardens. 

Our service was HORRENDOUS. We got seated outside and it took over 20 minutes for us  to get service. I would possibly understand this if the restaurant was extremely busy, BUT it was actually pretty quiet on a Tuesday afternoon. Finally when we got a waiter, he was not friendly and was busy talking to his other coworkers than to pay attention to us. He took our order and did not even look at us, he was mouthing something to his coworker. It was very unprofessional!! He did not recommend anything to us on the menu and seemed occupied with other things. We never got a refill of water and no one came to our table to ask about our food. It took us even longer to get our check and we had to track down another server to check us out. 

The food was VERY disappointing as well. I had the Moules au Safran et à la 
Moutarde with a side of the Pommes frites. The mussels had no flavor and did not even come with any bread. The frites were great, but how can you go wrong with that anyways?

 I was completely unsatisfied with my meal and was ready to be done with brunch. I am all for paying for a good meal, but if the service is not top notch, it is not worth it at all!
