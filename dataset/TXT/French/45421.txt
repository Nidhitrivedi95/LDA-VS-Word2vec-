mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q this place was not only beautiful, our server Eric was excellent. Every piece brought to us was a piece on the plate and in my mouth. I had the endive and the gnocchi as
my two appetizers and the duck as my entree and the tarts as my dessert. Everything was perfect. Everything captured all my senses!
