xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g Just came back from dinner there tonight.  First of all, it was very expensive and I think that although it was a gorgeous setting, the restaurant's atmosphere just did not come together.  Honestly, it was kind of tacky.  There are sooo many wonderful restaurants in Las Vegas, with great atmosphere.  This place is not one of them.  And I hated the Christmas music.  Really??  Ugh.....  I will say the food was very good, but very overpriced.  Wish I had gone to the restaurant right below it.......
