rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I had to go back here for brunch as the l enjoyed it so much the last time.  We wound up over-ordering again as we did the night before...well, Vegas is all about excess!  We started off with the sampler of pastries: beignets, chocolate croissant, cheese danish, and cinammon bun, with the cheese danish being the best of the bunch.  They were definitely much bigger than expected though...we were already kind of full before our savory orders came in!

Since we did a lot of drinking the previous night, we all felt like some eggs.  I got the croque madame, which is absolutely the perfect hangover food with the fried egg and sauce on top, and fries on the side.  Nothing like fried starch and fatty food to get rid of that hangover!  I had a taste of the quiche and the omelette as well, but I liked my dish better!

I have to say I was a bit disappointed by the bellini...it just didn't taste as good as it did the first time I went here.  There's more juice now compared to the bubbly, and it seems like the bubbly they use isn't as good quality. 

Service was pretty good, considering there were a ton of people there.  I would still go back on future visits, though I'd probably stick to only the pastry or the eggs and not both.  Who says French food has teensy portions?  Apparently that isn't true in Vegas!
