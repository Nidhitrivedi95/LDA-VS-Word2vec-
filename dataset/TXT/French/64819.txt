teTQU7TIPE0O_B1zN_239w It was our first time there, and I can say that there will be others for sure. The food, service, place and staff were amazing! The waitress and the manager who talked to us were very kind and friendly! 

We've ordered the contest winner pork chop, and my fiancé ordered the atlantic salmon, along with spinach dip as an appetizer and creme brûlée cheesecake as dessert, and it was delicious!

I totally recommend this place. It was one of the best experiences we had. And you feel very especial as a customer, because they don't advertise the place (as the manager said to us), relying on customers satisfaction as a marketing strategy.
