UxWH8zRYIBgs6Q2oykvRdw We came here during the Chrisrmas market for dinner and tried a lot of dishes. Highlights were definitely the coq au vin poutine and the chocolate bomb for dessert. For mains we tried the octopus, filet mignon, lamb, and burger. The burger looked delicious but it was dry. The filet mignon and octopus were cooked perfectly. However, my lamb came out too cold for my liking and the staff decided to reheat my lamb instead of making a new one, turning my pink lamb brown and overcooking it. I expected more, especially if im paying close to $40 for that dish alone. Also, one of my friends were vegetarian and there was only one vegetarian main. Please give them more options!
