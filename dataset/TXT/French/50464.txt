oXSnH3yxo4qMPHtLjEdwFw Came at prime time super time for a birthday party which was 7 of us and of course they lost our reservation, no biggie but still not professional. They gave us a private room it was a little less loud then the rest of the restaurant which was nice. No ac or fans so dress in something breathable.

The food was ok nothing to go gaga over, I tried the shrimp 4 for about 20 it was expensive for what it is but since it's a byow they gotta up the prices. I had the veal with lemon sauce and veggies and a potato. The sauce was good on the veal, veggies and potatoes needed butter it was just blah without it. Mushroom risotto was good big portion so that was a plus.

The floors were so damn sticky and I decided to wear heels so I could barely walk and then the bathroom was so slippery the floors I was sliding all over the place. A simple one two with the mop would do the trick. Our waitress was cute and sweet nice girl she did the best she could which is always appreciated. I wouldn't go back just because there's so many better spots where I can get my yummy veal, but I had a great time with friends :)
