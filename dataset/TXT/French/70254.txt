x1bjSvpIJTN1KBFhUjOU_g I was treated to a nice birthday lunch here by an even nicer person. It was fairly quiet but there was still a nice relaxed and intimate atmosphere. We were given bread, salad, tapas and water on arrival which was a nice touch. The lunch menu was reasonable; £7 odds for two courses, and the food was tasty enough that I would come back here for a weekend lunch again. It was a bit strange when we were given our wine in juice glasses (although the wine descriptions on the menu were hilarious!), and it was rather Scottish to get fries with everything. The waiting staff were typically laid back and French, so it took a while to get our bill and we almost got given somebody elses dinner by mistake after eating our own.
