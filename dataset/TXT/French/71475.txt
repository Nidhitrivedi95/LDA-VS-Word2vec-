XcWlBj5oQgzKhR7Cxovj3w Waiter was awesome, food good but wasn't prepared properly, manager while there didn't once check with a guest saw him move about several times even to the table next to us to clean. It's airport and they know people are captive to what's within the. Airport while traveling so there'll be others to pass through will not be my first choice next time I travel
