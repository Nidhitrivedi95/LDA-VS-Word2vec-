rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A We went for brunch to this amazing place, just getting there through the gorgeous corridors was breathtaking in itself and thankfully the food did not disappoint. We had the lamb sausage hash it's was utter perfection the food was perfect the views were perfect and your coffee cup was always refreshed before you even knew you needed one. And to top it off we order a pecan sticky bun, it's was flaky and buttery and all kinds of yummyness... Well done!! Just well done
