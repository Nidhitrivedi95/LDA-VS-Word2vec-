ysJo5Jdo29XOBCnKrbUKWg We went to Paris 66 for lunch. The 1 star is because the chef was loudly flirting with the waitresses, talking about fart jokes, and basically being terribly annoying and obnoxious in a place where we were paying $100 for a nice meal. The only other people in the restaurant showed up long after us but got their food first. The steak tartar just tasted like a raw hamburger drenched in pickle juice. I did enjoy the escargot and filet mignon. Basically, for an environment where they're charging what they are, the cooks shouldn't be behaving like they work at Taco Bell and shouting about their gross drama for all to hear. Act professional.
