vg55SAkrEmuHpWfIMtJjBQ Generally outside of my college student budget, Legume is one of my top picks when family is visiting. I ate at Legume for the first time a few years ago, I had one of my favorite dishes ever: homemade spaghetti in a pesto sauce, with fresh sautéed radishes, and a fried egg on top. Unfortunately, I'm unlikely to ever see this menu item again. I've eaten there several times since and have menu items that were good, but not quite as great. Legume's menu changes frequently, which is a strength, but also a weakness. As Legume tries to source its ingredients from local farms, I feel that the restaurant struggles in the winter months when local fresh food supplies are low and . Moreover, it appears that the chef will toss experimental items on the menu; there are "filler items" on the menu that do not meet up to the quality of that dish I had the first time.

The servers are passionate and well educated about the food and the menu. They are more than willing to accommodate those with dietary restrictions and they try their best to make sure guests are satisfied. On my most recent visit I had a stinging nettle soup with creme fraiche and 12oz rib steak. The soup was a perfect starter. Savory and light. The rib steak was hefty and filling, delicious none the less, what one should expect with a fattier cut of meat. Legume's decor sets a mood for freshness, combining art that depicts scenes and creatures from nature, I feel at peace when entering the warmly lit establishment.

Bottom Line: Legume is a standout restaurant. Farm to table freshness, diverse, changing menus, and well crafted menu items are ensured. Service is top notch and friendly. However, the menu at times feels that the chef is experimenting, or trying to compensate with a lack of fresh ingredients available in Pittsburgh's cold months. Would recommend and will be returning!
