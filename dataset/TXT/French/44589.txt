mnn--vaYHtNyBNYFYBFIog This is a place every french food lover must try in Montreal. Such creative high end cuisine in a modern eclectic sophisticated restaurant. 

First, I had green and white aspargus with pancetta and parmesan cheese as an appetizer. Aspargus were perfectly cooked. These were followed by the atlantic halibut, which was just amazing.

Highlight of the night was the wine. I asked the sommelier for something unique and he brought me a white 1989 Jura. I was first totally absorbed with the nose and then the tasting notes. A wine that I'll probably always remember and that was perfectly paired with the fish. 

As dessert, we tried the kalingo chocolate moelleux and the honey pound cake. They were absolutely delicious!

Cheers Toqué!
