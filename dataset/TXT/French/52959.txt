QeFsIMcIFIJcOrpthYL8jg Lovely French bistro in Old Montreal. We were seated in the original section of the restaurant which was nice. Complimentary bread with butter was good. Foie gras torchon was good with a berry compote. They recommend the lamb chops here ($32) you get five chips with some seasonal vegetables. My first dish came out cool temperature wise, dry and well done. I pointed it out to the server and she immediately took it back. She didn't say too much when she took it away and when she brought me back a new dish. Oh well the second one was much better as it was medium rare and tender. Flavours were ok but I've had better. 

My friends loved the seafood pasta and the steak frites. 

Caesar salad was large but way too overdressed and dressing tasted kinda off. 

Service was fine and offered gluten free options. 

Bathrooms could be cleaner.
