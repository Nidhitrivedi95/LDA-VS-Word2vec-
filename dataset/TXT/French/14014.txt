58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw If you had one morning in Montreal - especially a Saturday or Sunday...Come here! Fresh, delicious food. The Berry French Toast was to die for. It was not your typical whip cream and syrup variety but very original and unique. I dined at the communal table which was fantastic. Families, groups, dates, solo? It doesn't matter. This is your go to spot for brunch in Montreal.
