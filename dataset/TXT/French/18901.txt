aM4pb4teV2Tr0Z-ZRt4icg We had the best experience and lesson on macarons! We were kindly greeted by Howard. He told us his favorites and the most popular ones to choose from. Howard even gave us a brief history of the company.

Everything was tasty. My favorites we're pistachio, coconut, chocolate, and Colombian coffee. All macarons were delicious! Friendly, clean, and beautiful treats to choose from.
