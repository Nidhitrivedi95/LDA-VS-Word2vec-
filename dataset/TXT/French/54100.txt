qTBT6UDQP5-GSrB-UTn5CQ Nice atmosphere...casual but jazzed up with chandeliers and gauzy ceiling draping. Although the music was a little eclectic...ranging from bachata and Spanish pop to French pop...but always fairly mellow.  Haitian Creole cuisine is definitely a niche for Toronto.

The prices are very reasonable.

Appetizers were scrumptious...especially the lamb chops.  The piclicz (sp?) cabbage slaw pickled with scotch bonnets for the beignets was great too.

We ordered the whole snapper, creole chicken and ratatouille for the 3 of us.  The entrees were more simple...very hearty and felt more like creole home cooking, with rice and beans.  Filling!  Service was attentive and very smiley.

Overall, definitely recommend this place.  Something different than typical GTA fare.
