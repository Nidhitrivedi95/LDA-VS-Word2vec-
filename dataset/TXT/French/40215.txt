KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA My husband and I come here almost every Fri after work. The 4-6PM Happy Hour is lovely, although not well-attended. The small-plate menu is perfect after a long day on the job... together with top-shelf wines at 50% discount. The bar is surrounded by boxes of amazing well-selected wines, adding to the 'wine bar' appeal. My husband is a former winemaker (San Diego) & loves the selections. JUSTINE makes it a great experience-- another reason we love coming to Marche' Bacchus! Prompt, friendly service from this lovely lady*You cant go wrong with this great menu and HH prices every weekday, 4-6PM. Hope to see you there:-)
