A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g Their macaron was awesome! Don't be fooled by the look. I only got three macarons since looking at it, it really didn't look that amazing. But then when I tried it on the way back home from Vegas, omg, it was so good! Chewy inside crispy outside just the way macaron should be. I tried peanut butter, pistachio and caramel and caramel was so good! Peanut butter, not really as their filling was just pure peanut butter and it was just overpowering everything. :/

If I'm at Vegas, I'll definitely return!
