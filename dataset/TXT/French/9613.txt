4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw We came here for late lunch on Sunday. We loved it here!!
Our waitress, Holly was so sweet. The service was fast and attentive. The food was delicious!! Even the complementary French baguette was so fresh and good. 
It was Sunday but the rainbow trout tasted fresh, the shrimp cocktail was very fresh!! The cobb salad with smoked bacon and grilled corn was amazing, too!! This place is located right in the middle of the strip but the price was very reasonable. (compared to other Vegas strip priced restaurants, of course) I know some restaurants located in boondocks that charge more money for same or worse food. 
We had a very good experience here ;-)
If you are visiting, definitely sit outside patio area. Perfect view of the Bellagio fountain show!! Great spot to have tea and their delicious dessert.
They have breakfast, lunch and dinner. Open till 12 midnight. Perfect!! Can't wait to come back here.
