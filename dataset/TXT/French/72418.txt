XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q I don't understand how anyone can trash this place.  The food was great, and the spectacle was wonderful.  Yes, it's a little flashy, but not so flashy by vegas standards.  The service was very friendly, and we felt completely welcome and at home there--my husband wore jeans, and i was wearing a fairly simple dress--no need to wear tuxedos or anything.  The limo ride & walk through the mansion are a great touch, and all the various beautiful trolleys made dinner fun.  

The food was great.  I wasn't a fan of the caviar amuse bouche myself (the crab salad underneath really took away from the caviar, and tasted uncharacteristically unsophisticated).  And after a few courses, while all the cuisines & preparations are unique, there is some homogeneity.  But these are very tiny things, not complaints at all, simply discussion points.  The food was excellent, and we had a fabulous time.  If you are careful, you don't get full at all--just take a few bites of each course.
