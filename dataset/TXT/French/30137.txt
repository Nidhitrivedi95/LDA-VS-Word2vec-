FRuuIDOd21pTJHvEGIt1Gg Everyone enjoyed their meal more than I did, so this place is probably a 4/5...just not for me.

I came here specifically for duck confit and was gravely disappointed. I asked for it "extra crispy" (because I love tender duck meat covered in thin, crispy skin) but it wasn't crispy at all and, in fact, the underside of the skin was mostly unrendered fat. No thanks.

Having said that, everyone else enjoyed their food thoroughly:

Fois gras pate....wonderful
Mussels....exceptional
Fish and chips...."the best I've ever had" said Mitch
Braised beef cheeks....truly excellent

I guess I just ordered wrong.

The large space is a nice, well-designed bistro but for me, lacked a bit of warmth and personality. Next time I would go around the corner to Barocco.
