jo4KmAqlZ7vxjHIP7IIkAw For $25 you get a three course meal, including a salad, a main, and a desert. The duck salad I had was spectacular, as was the crembrule for desert. The main (I had lamb), while good was nothing special, but combined with everything else, that didn't matter. Definitely recommended.
