rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Though fairly popular and generally well-received, our meals were just fine. The atmosphere was amazing, but our food was nothing spectacular--or even great.

The most puzzling was that our server downplayed their food. "You can't go wrong with one of our steaks, but... you can get a good steak anywhere in Vegas." A statement like that doesn't instill confidence. Why would I order a steak now?

So I ordered the gnocchi instead, which was dry. Even though it was labeled as "pan-seared" I didn't expect them to be pan seared alone. There was a tiny bit of sauce near the bottom of the dish but it wasn't nearly enough to moisten the dried gnocchi and vegetables in the dish.

I hear this place is good for brunch though? Hard to say if I'd give that a go after this experience. Better meals were had in Vegas.

(The bread was amazing! Worth going for just that? Eh...)
