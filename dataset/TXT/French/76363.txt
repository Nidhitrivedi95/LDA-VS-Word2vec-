Yp9w4nhUowBU_IS_StFXbQ after all the glowing reviews, i had to try tableau out for breakfast.  i was not disappointed!!  my friend and i sat in the sun room which had almost a panoramic view of the garden/pool area...the day was kind of chilly, but the sun coming in from the windows was pleasantly warming.

i made my friend (with only a little resistance) order the short ribs and i ordered the huckleberry buttermilk pancakes.  the braised short ribs are perched on a round of crispy hash potato with soft scrambled eggs, bernaise sauce and garnished with chives. i couldn't decide which i liked more...my deliciously fluffy pancake or the short ribs...definitely a treat...even my purse got special treatment...our server brought out a little thingie (don't know w hat it's called) to sit my purse on

tip:  if you have breakfast here, plan to skip lunch =)
