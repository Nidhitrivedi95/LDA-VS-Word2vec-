COgwFthJpS4We16W5Gf4lw Great atmosphere.  My boyfriend and I went for a pre-valentines day date.  (He was out of town for V-day, so we went the Thursday night before Valentines.)  We pretty much had the place to ourselves.  The atmosphere was very nice - very elegant, very romantic.  I don't have a very refined palate, so most of the menu turned me off.  For someone with a more sophisticated palate, though, I think this place would be more enjoyable.
