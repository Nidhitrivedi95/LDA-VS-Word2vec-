ovtlrcsVRlgZZQUlHs_ovw I made reservations approximately 4 or 5 days before my husband's 65th birthday on Tuesday.  I spoke with a female who took my reservation for 3 for lunch at 12:30.  We arrived at the Vogue Bistro only to find they are not open for lunch on Tuesdays during the summer!!!  Left a detailed voice mail hoping to at least get a return call.  That was over 24 hours ago.  Obviously, customer service isn't a top priority for this establishment. One star is being generous.
