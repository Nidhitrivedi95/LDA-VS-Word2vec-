YVYHX7RCPjCBqEth2CS91Q C'est magnifique!  I hate to oscillate between giving 5-star reviews and 1-star reviews, but Brasserie 33 really deserves its accolades. I found out about this place through a LivingSocial deal a few weeks ago and decided to give it a shot last night.  

The restaurant itself veers closer to the up-scale side of things, but it does so without being pretentious.  The owners and staff are very friendly and personable, and the food itself was fantastic.  We ordered the charcuterie appetizer, bouillabaise, and salmon special.  All of the dishes were delicious. My only warning is that the entrees are enormous- if you order an appetizer, just be ready to take some of your entree home with you.  It was a very enjoyable experience, and I expect to be returning again soon!
