SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA I've been back to L'Albatros many times and I have to say it just stays wonderful! The manager is super hands on. Checks on tables refills water, good things. The food is always stellar and recently I was there with a group of 10 and we ALL loved everything and they even divided the check! I love having this place nearby, and will stay loyal.
