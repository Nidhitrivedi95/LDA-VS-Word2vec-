SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ It seems like the reviews on here about House of Tricks bounce between meh and mind blowing.   This place is a solid 4 stars.  You're not going to find anything in Tempe that really competes on this level, as even the nicest places in Tempe are corporate balloon knots and do not offer a true fine dining experience like Trick's.

I went here with my lovely lady on a Friday night and posted up at the bar.  The bar is tits and it's outside with trees growing out of it.  It has this Swiss Family Robinson type of vibe that's really cool. The entire property is a couple of buildings and the patio/bar, and it's a cool setup.

The food selection is legit, with a hefty portion devoted to seafood.  We dove into the seafood and got an order of the scallops and an order of the mussels. The scallops were legit.  Cooked perfectly, presented beautifully and garnished thoughtfully.  The Mussels dish was also a winner: Mussels were fresh and cooked well, and the sauce was just awesome with the sausage in it.  I devoured it.

Overall, I couldn't see why anyone would give this place any less than 4 stars.  Go now and eat some scallops.
