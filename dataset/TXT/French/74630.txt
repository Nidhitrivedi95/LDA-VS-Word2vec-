xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g I went here with my friend when we decided to eat a fancy meal at least once. It was our fault, we waited until 1 PM on a Friday to call and make reservations for the night and wasn't able to get one until 9:30 PM, but by then we were starving!! I am so happy that we were too!

We both ordered the duck, which thinking back I wish we had ordered two different meals but it was extremely delicious! I also had a drink, "An Eiffel Affair" and it was very good also. After reading the reviews here, I knew ahead of time I wanted to order the chocolate souffle, and we were both SO glad that we did! It was absolutely delicious!! Definitely a dish everyone needs to try!! I am also going to be sure to order the recipe book so that I can make it myself! Cannot wait to see how mine comes out! I will be making sure that I eat here every time I come to Vegas from now on, it was a great decision!

I just realized I forgot to mention the view!! We got a table at the window and we barely even talked to each other- we just kept looking around! The view was fantastic!
