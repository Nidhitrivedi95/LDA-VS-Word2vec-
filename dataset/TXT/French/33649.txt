hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA How have I not reviewed Baguette Cafe yet?

First, let me start by saying the owner, Olivier, is from France. This place has the best little "Paris cafe" feel to it. Now for the food..

The Croissants are TO DIE FOR. I love coming in and smelling them when they just come out, they're seriously mouthwatering. I get the croissant breakfast sandwich and add turkey- its under $5, super filling and delicious. 

I've tried the fresh squeezed juices and I'm impressed with them all, you can tell they're actually fresh squeezed to order. 

And of course, The coffee and lattes don't disappoint.. But then again, nothing about Baguette Cafe disappoints.
