ME6D5nLlfG0xZCtICOYDuw Decent place, stars more for variety than quality of gourmet food. The omelet making station was pretty good(you can add sautéed sweet peppers, onions, mushrooms, spinach, bacon, ham, sausage, gruyere, white cheddar and goat cheese). 

The French toast was pretty decent. The breakfast potatoes were ok...they looked better than tasted. Pommes Frites, skinny fries, were good--you order those from the waiter. One portion is good to split. The mac and cheese was good, terribly decadent! 

The coffee was so terrible, like watered down dirt. Cost $2.50 but not worth getting if you are a coffee connoisseur. OJ was alright, $3/glass. 

They had a great selection. Quality wasn't amazing but it is a buffet...so I'm not shocked. 

If you have a special occasion or big group, it's a good spot to go to. Beautiful interior and outdoor seating.  Nice bathroom, too. 

Wouldn't rush back here but if you have a craving for lots of different brunch foods it's a good place! $25 per person. Coffee and juice not included.
