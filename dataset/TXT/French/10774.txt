4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw We have eaten here 3 times for brunch and loved every dish. The egg benedicts are perfect: we especially enjoyed the smoked salmon benedict. The chicken Brie apple crepe was so creamy. The corned beef hash was real corned beef with freshly cooked potatoes. I'm particularly partial to the roasted cherry tomatoes which comes as a side with many dishes.
