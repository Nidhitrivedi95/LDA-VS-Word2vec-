pmoIMK8zGWvKsVOPDBYfzg What a gem!!!  Chef Gary and his staff deserve 20 stars *********************! S&D dined here on their first wedding anniversary, and were most pleased.  D just hasn't quite gotten over the caramelized pork belly, nor the rack of lamb.  S is still quite smitten by his Dover sole.  I mean, you can't even get this most places, folks. Seriously -- with the 2 for 1 martinis and the high quality of the food, how can you go wrong?  OH, but wait.  Throw on top of that the intimate dining setting and the to-die-for over-the-top graciousness of the staff...every night you dine at Andre's will be a night you will never forget.  We'll be back for more, Chef Gary.  It was very nice to meet you.  S says that he promises to take me there every time we go to Vegas (without the kid).  :)
