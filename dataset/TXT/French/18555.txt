aaWhSHpsE285eaSTzDxAMA The food at Bistro 185 is some of the best I have ever had. My Uncle Tom is a frequent visitor of this place and we meet him on occassion. The last time we were a party of 6 and let me say everyone's food looked and tasting outstanding. The portions are huge. My husband and I split a couple of things: the wild mushroom-topped salad was a large salad with several types of sauted mushrooms including bellas and shitake. They didn't skimp on the greens at all. We also got the Asian Hot Pot: tons of seafood including prawn-sized shrimp, scallops, white fish chunks, crab or lobster I think and shrimp dumplings, whole baby bok choy, as well as other Asian veggies in this amazing lemongrass coconut milk broth, Savory, spicey, super flavorful (not just salty like other places.) Others at our table got the pork chop which looked like an entire leg of a pig with all the fixings, frog legs on a bed of chopped garlic and herbs with olive oil... soooo good with the equally fabulous bread that was served to our table. We also tried the escargot and the muscles - yum. The seafood pot pie was served in a metal pot (slightly smaller than the Asian Hot Pot) and was full of seafood, peas, with an insanely rich cream sauce and topped with a big puff of pastry. We all got to try it and there was still way too much food left for my Uncle (but I think he managed) The wine list is superb, the desserts we tried were also crazy good (key lime pie and some chocolate-mousy goodness with ice cream topping, all melty) The food is absolutely worth the price, the ambiance is great, the staff was a great balance of unpretentiousness and professional and friendliness. The menu changes, I've heard so I can't wait to see what they will drum up next time I go... Oh, and even a vegetarian could eat well here; I saw a couple of vegetarian (pasta) dishes. Vegan? Maybe not...
