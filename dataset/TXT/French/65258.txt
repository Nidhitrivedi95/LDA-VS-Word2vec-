u-SvRRAfYgpbXZRfQgcTzA My sister who used to live in Japan now lives in Montreal and told me this is her favorite izakaya style place in Montreal, which is why she brought us there.
I was a bit skeptical at first when we got in and I saw the waitresses wearing very very short skirts "schoolgirl style" but I had no reason to worry. The food is solid; I highly recommend the Gindara (miso marinated black codfish).
Of course, part of the fun is to do the sake bombs, which is when it gets very loud (WHEN I SAY "SAKE" YOU SAY "BOMB"! SAKE BOMB x 3). Personally I am not big on sake bomb or sake for that matter but they have a full bar so no complaint from me there!
Staff was nice and put up with our table with 2 little kids moving around without rolling their eyes, which is cool. They have big tables which makes it good for larger groups.
