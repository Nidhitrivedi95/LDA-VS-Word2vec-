Tl2nqtPXlLbAG3qkUYVM2g we just got home from vincents for the restaurant week special. i have to agree with most of the reviews thus far in one way or the other. 

positives? i loved that we took advantage of the restaurant week specials because i could not possibly bear to spend that kind of money of food for a non-special event occasion. 
i liked my food....it was very good. however, everything is SOAKED in butter and almost anything tastes good with butter. i started with the leek and tomato tart. it was salty and acidic and had that buttery richness. my wife had the brie and fig pastry. filled with delicious gooey, salty brie paired with the sweet figs. both were great. 

second course, she had the lobster. i thought there was sauce on the lobster halves but it was....butter. i had the the ravioli. a bit too salty for me but i shouldn't whine because i took half home and eating it for lunch tomorrow. both, again, very good....and buttery.

final course, i had the flourless cake with rasperry sorbet. it's rich and dense, like a flourless should be. mine was moist and i thought perfect. she had the chocolate ganache with vanilla ice cream. less dense (or so it seemed) and equally tasty. 

our waiter fixed our uneven table, however, we did sit for a solid 15 minutes without getting any drinks or acknowledgement. they did have a mass rush at 6pm for all the restaurant week clientele but we were seated after a short 5 minute wait. what i did think was funny, like another reviewer mentioned was how the valet displays the uber high-end cars right out front....a ferrari, 2 upper level beemers, a high end mercedes, and a lexus. i wish my banged up ford ranger could have some upper class company!

good food, yes. buttery...absolutely. service, good. eat  here again? only when i make my first million.
