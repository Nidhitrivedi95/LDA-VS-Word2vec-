4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Yikes! My mom and I go here every year when we are in town for business. It's usually a lovely experience. This last time, however, it was anything but. Made reservations and were there right on time. When we arrived we were told to wait in the "reservation line." Never heard of THAT in my entire life. Waited for about 40 minutes because it just so happened to be Valentine's Day and everywhere else would have been booked up. After waiting forEVER (keep in mind I am super pregnant and achy) we were finally seated. After complaining to the waitress the manager came over and made a million excuses without ever apologizing.
And after all that...the food was OKAY.

Bad experience and terrible customer service. Very disappointed. Used to be a regular spot for us.
