yU3p0tEBtGuZLTcsBHw9uQ The breakfast potatoes in the "Le Plus" are freaking gnocci seasoned perfectly and covered with freshly grated Parmesan. Every detail is done perfectly. Every dish placed at tables next to us was equally incredible looking. Portions are quite generous. On the pricier side of my usual brunch trips, but 100% worth it.
