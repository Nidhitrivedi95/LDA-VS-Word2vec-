The service was extremely lacking: we waiting a long time for our waiter to come & then we waited a very long time for our entrees. Then, they brought our entrees and an additional side of Mac n cheese as "complements of the kitchen for your wait". We had no desire to have an additional side of Mac n cheese so we didn't even touch it. I would have much rather them give us a complimentary cocktail or discount on the bill. Why just pick a random side & bring it out? Bizarre. 

The food was good, but nothing outstanding by any means. The steak tartar we had for an appetizer was better than our entrees. I had the lamb, which was good however the sauce & additional items w/it did not pair well in my opinion. I had a side of roasted cauliflower, which was very good.
