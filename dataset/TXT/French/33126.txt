HHvO4MgBFabsmlInou6viQ Having lived in NYC previously, we were quite spoilt for brunch options (Cafe Orlin). This is probably the best and most flavorful brunch place in Toronto. Eggs benny/ scrambled with salmon/ duck confit and the French toast are simply excellent. The cappuccino was very good too. Portion sizes are just right and the service is friendly. Full five stars!
