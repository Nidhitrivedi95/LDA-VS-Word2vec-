UnouNrNq82DHYs5e8nGJNA Phenomenal. Cozy and quiet bistro with seasonal, local foods. The owner explained every dish and every wine very well when asked. I had the duck confit and my boyfriend had le burger. Everything was delicious and perfectly cooked. Cannot recommend this new addition to Toronto highly enough!
