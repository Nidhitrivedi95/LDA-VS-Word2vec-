4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Mon Ami Gabi is by far one of the best culinary experiences I have had. All the reviews on here raving about the food are accurate. You will not be disappointed. I would have given this 5 stars but I was turned off by the fact that you cannot reserve the patio. IMO you should be be able to reserve at least part of it and then leave the rest as first come first serve. The service is not that great and I am not a diva by any means. We ordered the Mussels and the plate came out with the sauce under the bowl so it dripped all over the table and our waitress did nothing about it. The server saw it and he finally covered it with a cloth. Between appetizers and our main course our waitress did not clear the table and I started to place our dishes on the table next to us to make room. When she saw this she rushed over and said, "No this table is clean." I wish mine was too! lol. Aside from that great place don't expect the same quality service as the food though.
