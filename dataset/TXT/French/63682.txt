t1mR_Zff6Dqv1TueE2JLEA I was very excited to come here for dinner. I have heard such great things. The food was amazing, the atmosphere was great, the music was pleasant and they had a great cocktail menu. 

The reason this review is not getting 5 stars is because the waiter that served my table of 3 was very poor service. After coming by to ask for what drinks we would like it took him a half hour to come back to ask what we wanted for dinner. We had wine glasses that never got cleared throughout the whole dinner, we had to ask for water a few times before he remembered to bring out water. Dirty plates piled up without being cleared even though he had come by the table multiple times to bring out more food or drinks. He wasn't overly nice and not rude, he was just clearly not on the ball which made unpleasant.
