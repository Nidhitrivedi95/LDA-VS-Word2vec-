SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ Went to House of Tricks last night for the first time. Sat outside in the courtyard and the ambiance was fantastic. Based on a previous review I tried the Thai Mojito and it did not disappoint..... it was delicious. 

Good, but not great, waitstaff and service. However, the food was the star of the evening --- it was excellent. Generous portions for the entrees and a unique selection of desserts. I had a great pumpkin cheesecake with cinnamon whipped cream. 

I would definitely recommend this restaurant for a group or a nice romantic dinner.
