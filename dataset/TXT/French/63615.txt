t1mR_Zff6Dqv1TueE2JLEA I came here for a bachelorette party. I would give the atmosphere 4 stars but the food 3 stars. The Moroccan tents and belly dancing show was an experience. The belly dancers even came into our tent and taught us some moves. The servers also shared the high pouring to show respect. Our waiter was not great at topping off our water glasses nor was he good at making food suggestions. There was a traditional couscous dessert that her really pushed that most of us didn't like. The rest of the food was okay but I wouldn't come back for the food.
