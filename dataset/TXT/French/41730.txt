KNBHGY4rQVuoHxZf_6ANuw Stayed at the Intercontinental for two nights over New Years with our three kids. We really liked our room and thought the location was great!  The room was a good size and clean. My husband and I also ate dinner and had cocktails in the lobby bar. We loved the friendly staff and the food and drinks were delicious. Our only suggestion would be to make the exercise room larger and more updated and possibly add a hot tub in that area as well. We enjoyed our stay and would definitely go back.
