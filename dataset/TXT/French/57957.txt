rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Fries were actually kind of a letdown but everything else I had was tres bien!

Serving sizes generally pretty small (the French toast could fit in a tin can) with the exception of the 'American Breakfast' which I take as being a subtle cultural jab - they bring out your choice of pastry, then a plate with a tiny piece of toast, a moderate helping of eggs, and a haystack-pile of meat (bacon & sausage). It was delicious but I couldn't finish it - and it is RARE for me to not eat all the pig on my plate.

Pricier than food court options downstairs, obviously, but super convenient if you happen to be staying in the Venetian.

Servers were kind and professional in spite of being ridiculously busy during CES.
