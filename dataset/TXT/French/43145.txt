lQ9VmIWvM6v-rONPkYX8aQ Alex was a nice treat for me.  Service was outstanding.  I love when restaurants give you gifts to remember them.  We got a box of macaroons from Alex.  Our server was great, very professional but also personable, which is important to me.  I don't like being served by a robot.  The food was excellent!  My lamb was cooked perfectly, the turbot was good too!  And the risotto was stellar!  The restaurant ambiance was a bit too formal in masculine decor for my personal tastes, but nonetheless, stunning.
