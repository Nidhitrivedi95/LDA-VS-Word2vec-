ovtlrcsVRlgZZQUlHs_ovw I had very high expectations for this place and was let down.
Pluses: We were able to have a table 15 minutes prior to our reserved time
Escargot was good
Water was cold
Service was good

I had the Steak Vogue and found it to be very tasteless, didn't even have the natural beef flavor a flat iron steak is known for. Asked for medium rare and it was closer to rare, any other cut this wouldn't bother me but a flat iron cut needs that little extra cook time. It was served with the Vogue Fries which are nothing special.
Wife enjoyed her martini and crime brûlée but wasn't impressed with her filet.

Really had high hopes this would be a convenient close place for special date nights but I'll only go back when I want Escargot in a pinch.

Expect to drop no less than $100 for two people depending on drinks/dessert of course. 

Appetizer came out quickly but so did the food which isn't a horrible thing but we weren't finished with our app. and our entree was being dropped off. I feel like the server needs to keep a closer eye on the other staff bringing the food out and have em hold it for a moment to time things better. 

So overall: Not impressed, especially for the coin.
