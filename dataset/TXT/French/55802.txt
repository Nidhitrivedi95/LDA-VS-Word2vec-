rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A We decided to dine at Bouchon based on Tom K's reputation, knowing that it would be expensive. Thank goodness our wonderful waiter had a flashlight so we could see the menu. I ordered the steak frites & my friend had a lamb special. The waiter recommended an appetizer because he said it would be 35-40 min. before we got our dinner (good sales job). My friend decided to order a braised, shredded veal appetizer ($17) which the waiter said was small but delicious. They brought a fabulous loaf of bread that looked like a tree branch & warm pistachios. We inhaled them. The appetizer was a 2" square of meat surrounded by a creamy sauce - I took one bite & let her have the rest. Nothing special. My steak was about 4 ounces with caramelized shallots and about 2 lbs. of crispy fries which I didn't finish - delicious but $35? My friend got 4 small slices of lamb - equivalent to 1 chop, served over what looked like bread stuffing with some diced turnips & greens. Very much haute cuisine - skimpy for $33. She had two glasses of wine. Our bill was $117. An "event" in a beautiful, but very noisy room which I wouldn't repeat. Lukewarm recommendation. Be sure to make reservations.
