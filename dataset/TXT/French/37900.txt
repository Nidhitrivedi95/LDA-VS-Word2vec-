jaSowNITPRRCYpPb3_pjdA I don't get it. People who's opinion I respect rave about this place.

I'm going to try this again soon, but only because the food critics can't all be wrong! However, I won't take a large group here again until I've had a good experience - all but one person in the group I took was disappointed and frankly, surprised at the poor execution.

Absolutely everything was wrong when I took a group of 8 here. One of our group was a chef, so I was particularly embarrassed I'd planned this dinner out.

The food was decent, but the numerous mistakes on nearly every order combined with the server errors in judgment and tactics made for an unpleasant experience. Just a small sampling of numerous mistakes made: several people got the wrong dish - when one came out wrong a second time, the server stated the first dish was still in the back and he could go get it again! I ordered mussels, and had to ask for a bowl for shells, then use the spoon they brought me instead of a fork. We had to keep picking up our plates and handing them to the server so he'd take them away. A medium rare steak was medium well. 

And what is with the space on the side that looks like a soup kitchen? We all loved the dining and bar area, but couldn't figure out what the other room was about.
