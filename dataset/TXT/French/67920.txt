The crepes are tender and buttery and the savory ones come with a side salad with mandarin oranges and a house vinaigrette. My favorites are the salmon or banana crepes. 

I can never tell when it's open though. Often I go, and they are closed for some inexplicable reason. Or they're super crowded...
