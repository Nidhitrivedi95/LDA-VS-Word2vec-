7Ym8NVxTO9b1FLGeWGp_Fg Five of us for dinner. Restaurant isn't licensed yet and we should have been told that when making the reservation.  Growing pains with food and service. And they charged $3 for sparking water which the waitress told us they make in-house. Without the license they should serve it for free. Dinner menu kind of all over the place.  French Italian fusion. Need to get more focused.
