SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA I was looking for someplace new to eat when visiting Cleveland and this was it!

It's great French-style dining with a pretty reasonable prices. Decent selection, well-prepared with a very encouraging list of wines and beers. I know, I should have been selecting a wine with dinner here but they had Chimay Blue available and I couldn't pass it up. 

The lighting and decor is a bit... "intimate" which made my co-worker question my intentions when I took him here after a job (ha!). Nonetheless, I will certainly be back.
