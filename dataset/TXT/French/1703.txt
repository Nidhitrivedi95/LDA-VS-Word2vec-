Although the interior design is quite charming; which includes the perfect pink walls that are decorated with unique photographs that the chef took himself (as  I learned he is also a very accomplished photographer)eyes should immediately turn to the beautiful waitress who is always the greatest pleasure and extremely attentive. 
Everything from their sumptuous vanilla green tea to the delicious sandwiches and crepes are amazing!  Everything that I have tried at Scratch has been quite the treat, although I would definitely recommend the BLTC accompanied with one of their many delicate, fresh made soups.  As I have been a Scratch patron for some time, I decided to try the restaurant for dinner as they recently opened Wednesday- Sunday nights. I must say I was more than impressed! The rich and savory flavors of both the Coq Au Vin and Chicken Normandy were excellent. The house red wine is a wonderful french blend that accompanies their meals perfectly. I adore the side dishes which consist of a delicious carrot puree and smashed potatoes that goes heavenly when dipped in the flavorful sauces.  My boyfriend usually orders the duck confit and every time he is more than satisfied and always compliments how tender and delicious the duck meat has been prepared. as if all these wonderful dishes were'nt enough, you MUST try their fabulous pastries! Im a sucker for eclairs so usually order one of their varieties which has never disappointed. If you are looking for a charming, unique cafe that will go beyond your expectations in every way, don't wait another minute and head in to Scratch, you will not regret it!
