bEVWHtBRYVwqaaNF4mWNYg Coquine is a delightful treat for a francophile like myself.  This place is bustling on a Saturday night.  For diners who don't plan ahead, you'll likely end up sitting in the bar, which isn't so bad when you consider the food you're about to have.  I've been here a couple times and have tried the cassoulet and duo of duck. I thoroughly enjoyed both.  Though the atmosphere is casual, Coquine is on the "special occasion" list of restaurants for me.
