HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw My favorite place to eat. As in, out of everwhere I've ever eaten in my life.

Truly serve the best meals I've ever eaten. The oxtail jam may very well cause a fistfight, it's so good!

Service is wonderful, but casual.

I have ordered several dishes on the ever-changing menu, and they have all been fantastic. 

The drinks are a bit "odd", as they try to go back to a 1920's style of cocktail. After the first couple sips, though, it all makes sense.

I. Love. To. Eat. Here.

Expensive, but worth it.

The only problem with this place is: being expensive and in Vegas it is always full of douchebags who don't give a rat's ass about the food, and only want to be seen there. If you actually care about the food and the dining experience the wait staff will almost certainly remember you.
