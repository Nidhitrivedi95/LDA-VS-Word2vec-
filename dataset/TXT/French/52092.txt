pmrHuQiy25xKB86tbOLBlA Real nice local place in Matthews. The outdoor seating is really nice for people watching and the food was above average. The menu was somewhat normal for I did not see much that really jumped out at me but the service was good and the quality of the food was above average.

We will be back for lunch or maybe dinner.
