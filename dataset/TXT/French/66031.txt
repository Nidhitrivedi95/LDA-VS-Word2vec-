udFcIcbWbxrO8uLF95WnQg We've eaten at Zack Bruell's C&H three times so far, and all three meals have been exceptional. Seafood is prominent on the menu, and the two things we've tried were all excellently prepared and very fresh. The place also works wonders with lamb and beef. C&H is more "New American" than the designated "French." If you want French, Bruell's L'Albatros in University Circle is a better bet. The interior is spacious, dimly but adequately lit, and classy, with a contemporary minimalist feel. It has the "bones" of the old jewelry store of the same name that once occupied the space in the heyday of Euclid Avenue as a retail street. C&H is, in my opinion, one of the very best restaurants in Cleveland. I haven't tried all of the most highly rated downtown restaurants, but I have to think that this one compares with the best of them. If you're going to a play at the nearby theaters, this is my pick for where to eat before or after the show. The servers are friendly, knowledgeable (or cheerful about finding out if they don't know the answer to a question), and highly professional.
