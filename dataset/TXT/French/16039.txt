78TC3sZSYBzBsSJ0z5pyhw We were looking for somewhere to eat one night and happened upon Le Provencal. 

The food. It was fine. Nothing great, nothing terrible. The garlic bread was OK while the accompanying marinara was bordering on unpleasant. My Rigatoni Bolognese was unremarkable, it is hard to criticize something that has no remotely defining feature whatsoever.

The wine. OK but overpriced.

The service. We came away with the vague sense that our waiter wouldn't have cared if we showed up or not. He did everything he should have, but very much by rote. 

So far this is very much a three star review. Nothing horrific but certainly nothing fantastic either. So why a one star review? Why the Yelp equivalent of 'run, run for the hills!'

The reason for that low of a score came later. About four hours later when I was clinging to my hotel room toilet for dear life. I won't go into detail but I was made very, very ill by the food a Le Provencal. I had been perfectly healthy up until that evening, this meal reduced me to a quivering wreck in a matter of hours.

You may be up for a bit of a gamble in Vegas but I don't recommend spinning the gastrointestinal roulette wheel. Keep your games of chance to the casino floor.
