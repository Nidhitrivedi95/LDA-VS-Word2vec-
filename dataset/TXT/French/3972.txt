2B46bRpDh49eDyjXGhL_ZQ A little gem for delicious healthy eating! Occasionally Yelp leads you to a place you would have never found on your own.  Thank you Yelp for leading me to La Masion de Maggie!
Maggie is a "celebrity chef" from the south of France who imported a little bit of France to Las Vegas.  French Maggie. French staff. French menu. But most important to me- French ingredients (ok, the coffee is from Italy!)
For the healthier inclined- the galettes (buckwheat crepes) are made to be meals.  Delicious, filling, nonGMO gluten free meals. Like most Americans, I used to think of buckwheat from buckwheat pancakes- but more recent digging on my part has discovered what a "superfood" buckwheat is (see link below).  
For the less healthy inclined- the imported French wheat crepes are a bit sweeter and have dessert toppings. French wheat is naturally low gluten and most 'gluten sensitive" Americans have discovered they can eat French wheat with no problems. 
At last you can eat delicious, organic, GMO free meals with no worries. Every mother in SW Las Vegas should be dragging her kids here every day!
The ambiance is great. Maggie is a kick and the other staff I have seen here are either from France (or Quebec perhaps which works for me too). 
Stop in and see Maggie (et ses amis) when you want a delicious inexpensive bite (or Italian cup of coffee) with no worries attached.
