rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I really enjoyed the brunch I had at Bouchon when I went last year. I don't head out to Vegas often, but when I did go out there, I had heard that the Vegas restaurant was the best. So coming into the restaurant was quite nice in that it's located inside the Venetian hotel(of which on it's own is a nice hotel). The restaurant itself Is a nicely decorated and bright place allowing for lots of natural sunlight to enter through the large windows. 

I had the corned beef hash plate, and it was really really good! It's homemade and served with a fried egg on top, served in a personalized metal pan with a side of toast.  The waiter was professional and provided me individualized Tabasco containers for my party. 

I'd recommend Bouchon to anyone looking for a nice place to have brunch. Just be aware it's not a cheap brunch place but I'm sure you'll enjoy their foods that also include killer pastries.
