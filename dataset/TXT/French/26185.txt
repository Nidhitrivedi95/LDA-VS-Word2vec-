d482l58ho0_IMdFkXX1F5Q Food was awesome, service was not so great.  We ordered the cheese plate the wrong thing cane out we didn't realize just thought it was bigger  than we thought. The waiter  realized the error and mid bite he took it away. Now I realize we didn't order it but once we started on it we knew it couldn't be served and wondered why they didn't just  leave it for a good  service experience.  Great food,service might be why I wouldn't go there again.
