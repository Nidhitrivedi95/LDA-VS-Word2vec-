Good grab and go place!  Excellent and friendly customer service!  The owners are super nice!

The crepe paper container is such a cute design, just tear off along the line, no mess at all.

As mentioned by Stephanie R., it's a small place, don't expect to sit down and have a long chat with friends.  Hopefully, one day they will expand their store to have more sitting area.  This is a new store and they will open another location next summer (in 2015) as per the owner. 

Price is reasonable.  

We had Philly Cheese Steak ($8.5)  and Santa's Omelette with hot salami ($8.5); it said $7.5 on their menu but they charged $8.5; I forgot to ask..oh well.  They both very good and yummy.  I tried the crepe itself and I was able to taste a hint of butter, YUM!!! I like it so much because their crepes wouldn't get saggy.   You know how savoury crepes are after a while with sauce... Their crepes hold well.   
 
The reason why I gave them 4.5 stars instead of 5 is, they only serve deli meat.  If you don't like deli like me, they have Mother Nature (black beans, avocado, green peppers, olives, spinach, mushrooms, havarti and pesto: $8.5), create your own crepe and sweet crepes to choose yum... all ingredients are fresh, you can see and taste the freshness.  
 
They also have kale walnut salad and mediterranean quinoa salad.
They have sugar cane juice ($4.99) which squeeze/press right in front of you; it is so fresh!!!

I will go back for sure.
