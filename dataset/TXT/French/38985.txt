jLxeBgWhLRbII2ACkgH1Sg My wife and I had breakfast here twice, and both times we were very pleased with the food. This restaurant is a nice change of pace from our usual selection of pancake houses. Every food item we have tried was delightful. The ambiance was pleasant and fairly quiet.

The only minor complaint I have is that both times we visited I ordered a danish and both times they forgot to give it to me until I reminded them about it.
