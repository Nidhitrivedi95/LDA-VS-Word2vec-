KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA Great location, great wine list, terrible food. This place is good for an afternoon cheese and charcuterie board with a couple bottles of wine and if you're lucky, some good company. Dinner is very hit and miss, and, if I'm honest, mostly miss. I've been going here for years and it's gone consistently down hill over the past 3 years. I've been reduced to just drinking and snacking there.
