utYpyFOjNisHl1h7lDGSGA What an absolutely amazing meal! I took my dad here during his visit to Edinburgh, and the food was outstanding. Our server was great too (and authentically French), and the ambiance was very charming.

We started off with the cheese in a filo parcel with black cherry jam, which was a great combination. It reminded me of a cheese blintz.

Then came the main courses: my dad got the sea bass special, and I got the ribeye. We both were very delighted by how delicious these were - the fish tasted very fresh, and my medium rare ribeye (made from Wagyu beef!) was cooked perfectly.

For dessert, we shared the chocolate cake, which was an awesome way to end a great dinner.

To top it all off, the price for the meal was amazingly reasonable. If you like French food (or even if you don't), check this place out! You won't regret it.
