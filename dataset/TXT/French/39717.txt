K1Y1cQT6KuWOfAoDbDIh_g Back here Oct 2014 and the service and food remains impeccable! Snails, frommage and an amazing black bass fish special were standouts. The waiters and the bartenders are exceptionally knowledgeable. Tradition reigns supreme.

Note: this is traditional French cuisine NOT Québecois - I stand corrected from my 2013 visit :)
