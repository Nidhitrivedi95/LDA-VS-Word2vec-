RmGjo_2kT5wDVoqJb_IDCg Finally made a visit to Le Rossignol's sister restaurant, Le Canard Mort. Sat at the bar and, like usual, ordered too much!

The French onion soup was really quite nice - not too salty and with a good onion flavour. Not that I'd expect less, as I enjoyed the same soup at Le Rossignol.

On to the fried sweetbreads. Done up like Buffalo chicken wings, including a blue cheese sauce and a cucumber slaw (should have been carrots and celery!), this was a generous dish of spicy and breaded glands. Tasty, but we couldn't finish. Or well, we knew we shouldn't if we wanted to leave room for the mains.

We also had the stuffed Yorkshire pudding. This one was like a roast beef sandwich in a turnover. It was okay - interesting to have tried.

On to the mains!

Enjoyed my osso buco with a glass of wine. Good flavours, though I'd like them to be stronger and more intense. Very tasty with the mash and veg. Would recommend this.

The schnitzel was perfectly cooked and the spaetzle was delicious. The vinegary cut of the cabbage made a nice contrast to the oil/butter of the other two elements.

A decent spot to visit if you're in the neighbourhood. Comfortable space with comfort food.
