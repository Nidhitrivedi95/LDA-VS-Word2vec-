Kut9tVbDX_f7qKMRRoXg3w If I could give negative stars, I would. This place is an absolute abomination to restaurants in general. 

Seating- Took twenty minutes to get seated with 6 tables open. No one noticed new customers? 

Table service - Took another 25-30 minutes to get plates, menus, and water. 

Food- Sucks. Seriously, go get some fish and chips a few blocks away that will blow your mind off. 

Final thoughts - Go elsewhere.
