The interior is striking to say the least so full marks there. The staff is well trained though is overly keen at times so full marks there as well. So if those two items are high on your criteria by all means visit this place.
I have had exposure to both the bakery and the restaurant so will rate them separately.
Bakery is kind of neat and the desserts look enticing. I ordered a apricot tart and my friend had the Bostock. The tart has a good shell. The filling was over powered by the almond extract IMO. Bostock was OK again over use of almond extract IMO.
The macarons look good so will give them a try though next time but with SOMA right across I think they have stiff competition already. 
I dined here for brunch. Had already looked at the menu so knew exactly what to get. 
Crab Benedict. Crab meat was forgetful and has that frozen taste to it. The eggs were poached well and the hollandaise was OK. Fries were shoestring and didn't do it for me. 
French toast. Didn't try it as was having dessert later from the comments I was told it was way too sweet.
Merguez Sausages a surprisingly huge portion, was decent and I would recommend sharing it with a 3-4 people as an add on if you like this sausage.  
The cafe latte was forgetful too apparently. 
I would say 2.5 stars for food with a half star thrown in for ambiance.
