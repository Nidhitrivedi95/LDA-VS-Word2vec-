0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g Came here for my anniversary dinner and it was hard choosing between the lavish indoors with exquisite Picasso paintings or outside with a view of the fountains. We opted for outside and glad we did. The service was impeccable, the food to die for and the view amazing. It was June, so quite warm, but the fountains offered a nice temporary cool down when they were going off. Just be ready to pay a lot of money for this lavish place, but it is ooooohhhhh soooooo worth it.  The prix fix menu is the way to go. Always trust the chef when it comes to a 5 star dining experience.
