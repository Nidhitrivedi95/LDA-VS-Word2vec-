YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g After a couple days of exhausting fun, my wife and I decided to say close to our hotel for the final night and dinner.  Weekday night allowed us to walk into Fleur without a reservation.  We are glad that we did.   We have stayed at Mandalay Bay many times, but this was our first venture into Fleur.  We had a choice of seating, on the patio for people watching or inside the main restaurant.  I chose inside because one of my Las Vegas resort irritations is spending premium money for a meal and feeling like I'm dining on a casino floor.  The restaurant was well decorated.  The table was a bit small once loaded with plates, drinks  and sides.   Most people were neatly dressed, but not as dressy as seen in some top tier resturants.   

Despite a menu filled with tempting small plate offerings, we went with big plate selections.    Filet for my wife, a 12 oz New York steak for me.   We split an order of citrus braised asparagus.   The steaks were wonderful.  In fact, the entire meal was every bit as good as many more expensive experiences that we have had at many of the "marquee" Strip restaurants.   

Steaks, drinks, dinner salads, a shared desert and a couple coffees cost us about $80 less than a comparable dinner at Sinatra in the Encore.    And the food was better at Fleur.   We get to Las Vegas a few times a year.   Next time, I'm trying the yummy looking small plates.
