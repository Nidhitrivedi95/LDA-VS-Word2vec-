1. The food here is to die for. The little details in these dishes make them extraordinary! For example, they grind the coffee sugar EXTRA fine, so luxe!!

2. The decor is dark and intimate. Bathroom's were clean and had fresh towels to dry your hands.

3. Service was very friendly and attentive. Not pretentious at all. 

OVERALL:
-It is super pricy but trust me, it's worth it!!
