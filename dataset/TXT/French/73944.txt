xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g My friend and I dined here on a girls trip to Vegas. The food was amazing and great service too. I'd read a few reviews saying the service or food had missed the mark but we went on a busy Saturday night and still had a window seat to view the Bellagio water show. They only take window seat reservations at the 430 seating but we lucked out. We ordered the Escargot which was delicious, the Butternut Squash soup with Duck and a Beet Salad. The flavor of the soup with the Duck in it was incredible.  For our  main course we ordered the Beef Wellington that was worth the price and seasoned and cooked to perfection.  The pistachio souffle for dessert was huge and went down easily even though we were stuffed. I'd love to return here someday.
