YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g First year wedding anniversary in Vegas.  Hmmm, where do we celebrate to call the first year in? 

Hubby: "Why go to Fleur de Lys in Vegas when we pass this restaurant everyday on our way home?"

Me: "Because I want to stick to what I know." 

Five minutes later, we are seating in this darkly-lit modern space.  Chocolate drapes.  60 Foot ceiling. We were seated in one of their enclosed dining spaces - with large drapes covering us from the rest of the dining area.  Super exclusive, super shala. 

For appetizers hubby orders the Chilled Maine Lobster salad with watermelon granite, balsamic oil reduction, and vanilla oil. He decides on the prix fixe and orders the Roasted Lobster (I know, lobster, yet again) with carrot puree, pea shoot salad, mint oil, curry orange juice.  He also gets the Fillet Mignon with Oxtail Tortellini.  You know I was eating off of his plate - everything was excellent. Just absolutely excellent. 

I had the pan-seared halibut with shaved black truffle crust.  It was super good (but not as good as his lobster or fillet mignon).  

And here's the kicker - the chocolate souffle was absolutely awesome.  Is is probably what I was ask the jail wardens to serve me if I were to be executed tomorrow. 

The wine was excellent - and the service is top notch. This was probably one of the top dining experiences in my life.
