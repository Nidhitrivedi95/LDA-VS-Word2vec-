8ciT6qjI18x9EPtOb-gqYQ I've been to Coup Des Tartes twice now.  The inside of the restaurant is just as charming as everyone says.  I think the food is pretty good.  The onion tart is one of my favorite menu items.  I've had it both times I've gone.  I also love the BYOB option, and I think the $10 corking fee is pretty fair.  

I have a huge problem with the price of the menu items.  $26 for pork tenderloin? And even though I like the onion tart...$12? I'd go back for the appetizers, but I don't think I'd be back if I had to spend close to $100 for the meal.
