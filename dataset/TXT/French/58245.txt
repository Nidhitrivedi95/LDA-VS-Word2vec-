rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Great service and great food! I had the eggs Benedict, which were very good, and a Bloody Mary. My son had the brioche French toast which was gone before I had a chance to try some. My other son had the vanilla yogurt with berries and my wife had the waffle with caramelized bananas, which she loved!
