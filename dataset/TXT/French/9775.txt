4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I love this restaurant!!  HUGE portion sizes, I recommend sharing an entree plate rather than ordering individual plates.  

The fresh french bread is delicious with the room temp butter.  it just melts in your mouth.  Skip the escargots..the dressing on it was to overwhelming.  I ordered a yummy roast chix. and my BF ordered the steak bordelaise; it was great up until you have a bite with the carmalized onions....so if you order this, request for no onions.
