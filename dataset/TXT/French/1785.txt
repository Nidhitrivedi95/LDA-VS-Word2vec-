0JGMKaKJGVuDus5WcJzvjw I've never been to joe beef but I am a fan of this spot. The waitress was attentative and hilarious, I wish I had gotten her name so I could call her out.

The food was good. I split the patte which came out like a slice of pie with 3 sauces, a slice of bread, and ap ickle. It was delicious. All of it.

I split the New Guinea Fowl with foie gras for two. The bird was cooked perfectly with execellently crispy skin. The piece of liver on top was rich and delicious. I wouldve rubbed it all over me and bathed in it if I could.
