0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g I have been wanting to come to Picasso for a very long time and I have to say that my husband truly spoiled me when he brought me here while we were on our honeymoon!

The food and the service were spectacular and the ambiance was quite elegant. Our view of the Bellagio fountain was breath-taking and the art collection in the restaurant were quite exquisite and added a great touch!

For the two of us, we spent a little under $400 (including tax and tip) for dinner (we got a few drinks) and thought that it was well worth the money! The quality of the food and the presentation of the dishes were extravagant and really was the highlight of our trip! My favorite had to be the scallops and the foie gras. I ordered from the $128 menu and my husband ordered from the $118 menu. Both were great but I think my menu had an extra dish and the scallops were just so divine that if I came back, I would order from the same menu.

You really have to experience Picasso to fully grasp how amazing the experience is! I highly recommend you make reservations the next time you come to Vegas and you won't be disappointed!
