rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw Came here Saturday 2/27 at 5:00 pm for a happy hour menu that doesn't exist anymore. Ordered drinks and Duck Wings À L'Orange. Returned 2/28 for brunch which was absolutely fabulous. We ordered La Boulangerie, Hunter's Waffle, Mussels & Frites, and finished with crème brûlée.  

The wait staff was quick and attentive, constantly refilling waters and coffees.

I would definitely return for brunch! 

Every meal is served with a fresh warm baguette and homemade butter which I could have eaten 3 loafs of. 

Duck Wings À L'Orange: sweet, sticky, and savory. Not something I'd order again. 

La Boulangerie: Croissant was a disappointment, but the other 3 breads were very yummy! 

Hunter's Waffle: Lot's of savory duck, perfect poached egg, rich maltaise sauce. The waffle could have been a lot crispier, and I think had it been I would have been in love with this dish had the waffle not been soggy.

Mussels & Frites: These were the largest mussels I have ever seen or eaten, and every single one was huge. The french fries were typical and served with ketchup and a truffle aioli. 

Crème Brûlée: Everything you could expect and want from a creme brulee, perfectly and traditionally prepared.
