After going  back and forth a few times they were finally open one day ' we waited by the door for about 10 minutes waiting for a table  " the whole restaurant was empty " but the guy and the girl who were there couldn't make up there mind were to sit us ' finally we got a table  and later we found out that the guy was the executive chef ' my 1st one in baseball cap ' we ordered a few different things and they all tasted the same and I never knew french fries was supposed to be limp not crisp ' $100 later was one of the worst meals I had ....I give it 2 stats because the waitress was great and the place was clean
