rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A The waiters and attendants are all great and helpful. The food is delicious and fair priced for the level you are getting. The fries are by far the best fries I have ever tasted. 
Overall it's a great restaurant with nice atmosphere and quiet but I never got a wow feeling from my visit.  It felt like other nicer restaurant; nothing put it above the rest.
