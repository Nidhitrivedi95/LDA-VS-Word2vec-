1ThbwFVBL9YA2oOM11iO7g Went here for lunch and had the pressed cubano sandwich. It was delicious, but very rich, buttery and meaty. Filling enough for 2 meals! The atmosphere was nice, and the server friendly. Great but nothing too unique or special. Wish they offered more lunch options than sandwiches!
