9ET_RUNztevq4_OLAX80Gg I initially went to Cafe Boulud when it first opened but held off on my review as I wanted to give it another chance. Located in the new modern/swanky Four Seasons hotel, Cafe Boulud is quite chic, with interesting colorful art work and velvety couches. I like the open-space concept and the modern china. 

We had the brunch prix fixe ($38 for two courses) which includes tea/coffee/freshly squeezed juice. There are quite a few options to choose from--I had a hard time deciding! I suppose there is something for everyone whether you want savoury or sweet. I went with the berry muesli and the french toast. The berry muesli was delicious. The presentation was beautiful, but my French toast was more like thick pancakes than actual French toast. So confusing. Which brings me to the service---very mediocre. They brought our juices 15 minutes late, messed up our latte order and were just awkward altogether. The coffee is nothing to rave about.
