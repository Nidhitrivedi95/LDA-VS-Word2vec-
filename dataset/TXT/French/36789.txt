iEsNloJgy-MyA-_wqeB6jg Very awesome restaurant! The food is very well prepared and the service is top notch! The decor let's you know you are in a boutique French restaurant and not a chain restaurant! The 3 entrees special let's you try different dishes at a reasonable price! I highly recommend going to this restaurant! Even got a very nice Happy Birthday Deseret!
