Yp9w4nhUowBU_IS_StFXbQ Impeccable service and perfect menu selection! I had the vegan "eggs" Benedict and it was just perfect! It looked, taste, and had the same texture of eggs... I couldn't believe on how good it was! My only complaint is that we don't have one location in Cincinnati! Loved it!!!!
