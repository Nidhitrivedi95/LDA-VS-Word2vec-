4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Great food &great service!
My friend &I ate here last night
There are quite a few steakhouses near us &we couldnt pick a steakhouse.
We were heading to the Bellagio &noticed on Yelp there was a FRENCH steakhouse right across the street &we decided to try it out.
It's cute, convenient bc its on the strip &we can watch the Bellagio fountains from this steakhouse.
I got the hanger steak &my friend got wild boar. 
My, my this place was delicious!! 
It was sooo cute, I would definitely come here again. 
The staff was very nice &courteous. 
They always came &checked on us to make sure we had everything we needed. 
Thank you Mon Ami Gabi staff! We had a great dinner!
