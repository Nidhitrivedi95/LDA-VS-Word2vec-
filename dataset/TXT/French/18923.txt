An_U8woQkFVsMqVblkImZQ I had DT* for the first time after a long weekend of drinking. (Medical joke intended.)  With a rotating menu of seasonal brunch and lunch options, I appreciate the work the chef puts into his creations.  I had a tower of lemon-dill scrambled eggs served above, below and between two slices of brioche toast and the mountain was topped with luscious smoked salmon.  Luscious! 
The sweet brunch items seem to be served in smaller quantities than the 'salty' items such as the egg, quiche, and omelet options.
