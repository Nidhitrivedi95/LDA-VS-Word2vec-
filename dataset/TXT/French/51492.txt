I would be interested in their recommended wine pairings (next) but was distracted by the kitchen noise at our table - in the same room as the oven. It was disconcerting to note a salad languishing for its partners' plate on the counter.  Last minute substitution for seafood in salad.  Salad very good. Gnocchi dish too heavy for Italian preferences. Extra star for downtown and service. (Bring change for parking.)
