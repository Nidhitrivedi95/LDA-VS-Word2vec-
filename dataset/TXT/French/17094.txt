9ET_RUNztevq4_OLAX80Gg We went for Summerlicious lunch on a Saturday. Booking process was smooth. The hotel and restaurant decor is impressive. Modern and chic. Restaurant was bright and airy, not at all stuffy. Staff at the restaurant were courteous. We had the salad and chicken galantine for appetizers. Beautiful presentation, and the taste was good. Mains were even better. Again the presentation was impressive. The fish and steak were really well executed. Cooked to perfection. Flavours were exquisite. We both ordered the passion fruit sundae for dessert and it was so delicious! Just the right balance between tart and sweetness. And it had a mixture of different textures so that each bite was exciting. I am so glad I got to try this place with the Summerlicious promotion. Can't wait to come back again, I wouldn't mind paying full price for this quality.
