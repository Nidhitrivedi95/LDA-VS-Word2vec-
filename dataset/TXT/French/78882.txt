I thought this was a French cafe, but it is just a regular American diner with super-high prices for what you are getting. $39 for a piece of steak? I don't think so. Here's what we had:

- Steak frites: Dry and small. All the French fries we ordered (came with the burgers and the steak frites were overcooked like they had been frozen and deep-fried)
- American burger: Nothing to report, no special dressing, nothing worth getting again -- we only got this at the behest of my cousin.
- Parisian burger: Better flavor, since there was brie and pear, but not great. Again, no sauce!
- Salmon: This was actually good, but the portion was insanely small. Very buttery and moist. 
- Caesar salad: A bit too salty, but I like the anchovy on the salad
- Roasted half chicken: Super dry and tasteless. 

The food sucked, and that breaks my heart, because I used to eat here all the time with my parents 10 years ago when they took my brother and me to Las Vegas. The food I remember was tasty! Even my parents liked it. 

Service blew. Our server took our order impatiently and didn't check on us. At one point, we wanted to order more food, but after 20 minutes, and asking someone else to find our server twice, we were already done with our meal and didn't want anything else by the time he deigned to show up! 

Also, one of my pet peeves is French grammatical errors at a place that is representing itself to be French. Their 3-course menu is called "Le American" -- sigh. 

Anyway, if you have to eat here, ask to sit "outside." It's much cuter than the sad inside.
