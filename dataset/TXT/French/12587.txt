4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw This place is amazing. My boyfriend and I went during CES, and even though we didn't have a reservation like almost everyone else did, they got us right in. The wait staff is very attentive and friendly. The food is to die for. I have eaten all over the country and in many other places around the world and this is the only place I have found that A) cooked my steak exactly how I asked for it to be cooked, and B) paid attention to every little detail with the food to make it perfect. 

The only reason I could not give it 5 stars is because I did get some plastic in my food on accident, and working in a busy restaurant I know it happens from time to time. They apologized sincerely and were very understanding.

I would definitely go back in a heart beat. Tip for others though, it does have outdoor seating where you can see the fountain across the street but you get seated faster and have way better service inside.
