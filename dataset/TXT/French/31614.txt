gjCmXkMNVE0JSk8puUwv6g I would definitely rate this place more than 5 stars if I could. First off, their customer service is TOP NOTCH! Probably the best service I've received in vegas. The food was incredible as well. I ordered the ratatouille and my bf ordered the salmon. We also shared the salmon and tuna ceviche. All the dishes were delicious; especially the ceviche. What's impeccable about these dishes was that we can taste each ingredient all beautifully blended together. That's one superb chef! For dessert we had their raspberry macaron and exotic. Both were beautifully presented and super tasty. I seriously can't wait to visit eatt gourmet bistro again!
