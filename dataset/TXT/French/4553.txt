Although the calf liver dish was just OK, the bread, pickles and wine list were truly a wonderful component of the dinner. A special mention on their wine list is worth noting. Prices on wines were fair and selection was excellent. I especially enjoyed their fortified wine selections! Great service where servers came across knowledgeable, engaging and humble.

Enjoy Montreal!
