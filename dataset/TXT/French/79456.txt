Zm49-4emuoqhfb-nOPEYOg First time using the Yelp app to find something that was "healthy" and very close to me for my lunch as I was in a hurry. Enter Spanel with great reviews and only 0.2 km away...I had heard of the place but didn't know they offered wraps for lunch which is exactly what I was craving. I got the chicken, pesto, spinach & goat cheese wrap and wow! I got to see the chef make my meal right in front of me which made me anxious to get back to the office to eat. Took me all off 4 minutes to finish my wrap! It was delicious and came with a fresh salad which satisfied what little hunger I had left. Happy I found this spot so close to work and can easily become a regular.
