4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw After walking the strip for quite some time in the mid-morning hours, I was damn hungry. Mon Ami Gabi looked pretty cute - all French and proper - but they didn't seem to mind when hubs and I rolled up in our workout gear hoping to get a table and some breakfast. 

The patio was a considerable wait, so we elected sit indoors (which ended up being only 2 feet from the open doors/patio. Hey - we could still see some street performers and a few walks of shame. Fine by me.

The service was most excellent and efficient to boot. I went with the lemon pancakes - a giant, but very thin, lemony crepe like pancake with strawberries and a hefty side of fresh whipped cream. Hell. Yeah. The pancake was delicious yet light and the strawberries were uber fresh. I also nabbed a few bites of hubs' quiche lorraine - also a delightful, rich and tasty choice. The one food item I wasn't crazy about was the chicken sausage. Normally I'd down that in 30 seconds flat, but these particular links had an odd spice combo to them...paprika? I don't know, but I didn't dig it. 

Price wise, Mon Ami Gabi is quite fair - especially for the high quality and portions. Next time I'm in Vegas, I'll definitely head back here for breakfast!
