Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA I made a reservation for my best friend's bachelorette party!

We had a group of nine girls, and the management made us feel special from the beginning.
We were greeted by the manager and lead to the chef's table with a gorgeous view of the strip. The chef's table was sectioned off by glass from the rest of the restaurant so we felt like VIP.The sun was setting and the girls were impressed...
Our server was very nice, and food was great, and the view spoke for itself. Our bride even got a special desert with congratulations" written on the plate, and to top it off, the girls all got lemon madeleines hot from the oven with chocolate dipping sauce-yum.

Over all, it was the perfect start to a perfect night, and our bride to be was happy.
