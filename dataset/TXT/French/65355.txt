u-SvRRAfYgpbXZRfQgcTzA I have never been deceived by them, the menu is great, they have amazing choices. I love their octopus balls and their ramen. They also have the day special which is always great (for me, never had something I didn't like). If you still have some place for dessert (which I always do) they have some nice traditional choices, as the Michu ice cream or Taiyaki (red bean paste in warm soft fish shaped cake). Everything is good, just go there if you are craving some good Japanese food!
