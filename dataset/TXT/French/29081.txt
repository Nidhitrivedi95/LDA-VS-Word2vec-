EPb3FWs3mxQLUjGeMNP0SQ I didn't try the restaurant so can't offer any insights other than to say that the decor is stunning, BUT the music is quite loud. On my way to the elevators, I felt like I was taking a walk through the 90s, lol.  

The terrace is a decent size but not huge. We were able to get a table for six fairly quickly, so that was great. My friends and I ordered Mojitos and they were delicious - also, quite reasonably priced! I think I paid $7 for the drink, so when the bartender told me the price I had to ask her to repeat just to make sure I heard her correctly!

The view is great, and the ambiance is pretty relaxed. I would recommend it.
