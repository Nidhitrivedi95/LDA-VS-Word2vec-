KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA Went for dinner Saturday night, back for brunch the next morning. The service was great; polite, enthusiastic waiters, very helpful hostess (found us outdoor seating in 10 minutes!). The food was good; the charred octopus appetizer was a bit bland, the duck was excellent, the portions were good size for dinner. Dessert was excellent; the crème brulee was perfectly done, with a nice crust, not too thin or watery. Brunch was very good as well; the chicken & fries had perfectly cooked chicken, and the coffee was not too dark, not too light. Also, the wine selection was excellent, since the restaurant includes a wine store, you can pick a bottle from the store and take it straight to your table. I'll definitely be going back.
