ZV7t55UEx1LnBOWqTrutSw Spent New Year's Eve there. The food was amazing, farm to table style with all local products from Quebec. 

Try the Francobolli (big ravioli with homemade ricotta) or the slow cooked bison. The $37 menu on Thursday is a real bargain... 
The warm chocolate cake was sublime and the perfect way to end our meal. Wish they had more vegetarian main dishes. 
Cosy decor and friendly service. That's all you need to know!
