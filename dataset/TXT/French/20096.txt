aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw MACARONS!!!! I've died and gone to heaven. 

They are so light and fluffy. A little crunch on the outside and chewy on the inside, not to mention the filling! YUMMMM! I think I've pretty much tried all the flavors. Vanilla, pistachio and coffee are my favorites. I even tried the seasonal orange, which was delicious as well. 

Good thing Vegas is the closest Bouchon bakery to me or else I might be buying them every week!

Definitely a must try if you're visiting Vegas.
