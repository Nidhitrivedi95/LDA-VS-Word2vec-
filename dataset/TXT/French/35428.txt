htQgj-ANQpZGpIpkkrEmyQ Back today to give it another shot.

This time we ordered the INSP burger with pulled pork fries ($16+2) and the Sal and Blin (12).

According to the menu, Sal and Blin is "Salmon Torched + Jalapeno Cheese Mini Pancakes + Papaya Slaw (lil'spice+soy mayo) + Amaranth". It was light and delicious - an excellent appetizer. The torched salmon was excellent - could be the best I've ever had. No fishy taste, fresh and so soft. Again, Inspire likes to play with a whole lot of flavors in its food. I actually liked it better without the jalapenos. I was able to taste the different flavors so much more. They don't mention it, but there is tobiko, scallion, and fried lotus root as well. The Asian in the Asian fusion food here is in the details.

The INSP burger is a burger with tomato mayo, burger, seared pork belly, and fried egg. Surprisingly light tasting for a burger but it was good still. Only thing was our pork belly was more like pork jerky, it was tough and chewy. We mentioned this later to one of the waitresses and she was very nice about explaining that if we had told her when we found out, they would have brought us a new one. Pulled pork frites were the same as last time. Still delicious. Probably the thing I liked most.

Service felt a bit slow today - we decided quickly what we wanted but still waited at least 4-5 minutes while there was the one server for the whole restaurant right next to us just waiting by the chefs' window for another table's order. Depends on who you get for the quality of service I guess.

Still a 3.5 for me. The food was nice and interesting, but I've decided it's not quite my taste but that's just my personal preference. Definitely give it a shot though, you might like it better than I do :)
