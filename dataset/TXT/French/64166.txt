tCSlpwJQ4CZsUEMZeH2SFg My whole family went here for Christmas Eve dinner.  Hoping to experience a nice evening, we were disappointed.  The duck and salmon were was too oily.  And the steak was tough.  The flavor was nice, but definitely left something to be desired.  But we were very disgusted when they pretty much kicked us out.  At 9:35 pm!!  They started clearing our whole table before some of us were even through with dinner.  As we started to get ready to leave, they even turned the music off!  They just couldn't wait for us to get out!  The last time I am taking my business there.
