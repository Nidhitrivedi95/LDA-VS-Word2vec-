SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA We have been to this restaurant countless times over the last several years and the food, the service, and the ambiance have always been outstanding. I certainly owe them a review. As aforementioned, though we have been here more than a dozen times in the past, I will just specifically review this dining experience. My husband and I went over the weekend and sat on the patio and it was a perfect night weather wise. The service was a little bit slow because of how busy they were, but I will not hold this against them because in their defense, I think that is an anomaly. Their service typically is excellent. We often get the cheese board which is the best cheese board I've ever had regardless of city, but it was a cool enough night where we each got a cup of the onion soup which was phenomenal add anyways. We split the special that night which was the halibut and I've included a picture. It was beautiful and well done. We finished the dinner with a lemon roll dessert which was more than amazing. My husband typically gets a beer and myself a cocktail although we did not get drinks this time. In summary, this is one of the top five restaurants in Cleveland because of the quality of the food, the service, the atmosphere and ambience, and most importantly, the consistency.
