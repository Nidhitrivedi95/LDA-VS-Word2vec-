She sort of disappeared right before we were ready to order.  Other then that the service was decent.  We started with a melted cheese similar to Brie it was good but the portion was very small.  We also shared a small roasted peach salad with arugula which was fine.  Two of the diners had the Halibut.  Again very good mix of flavors but very small portions.  The other diner had the lamb bolognese.  Another small portion.  We had two deserts a chocolate cake and a butterscotch pudding.  Hadn't had butterscotch pudding in years and it was good and rich like it should be.  I was with all women and I barely felt full when I left.  I think my husband would have left hungry had he been there.  I would be willing to give this another try for sure.  On a side note, I always leave Zinc Bistro hungry too.
