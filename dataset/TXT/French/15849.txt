6GCbZASjMnAPYBWLc_z30g Charming building as all Mimi's are. Lovely decor. Pretty good food. Decent prices. Only 3 stars because...... They were very much not busy at all (dinner time), yet the service was amazingly slow and spotty. We watched as two groups came in while we were eating, no host or hostess was anywhere to be seen, they waited about 5 minutes, the second group of 5 gave up and left. The first, an elderly woman with either a friend or daughter, finally got seated... Our waitress was super nice, yet very slow on service, as well. We could hear employees talking back in the kitchen, like they were just hanging out behind the scenes. Didn't seem very professional at all. I hope they improve this. 
One plus: my birthday coupon was expired, but they still honored it and gave me a free slice of cake. :)
