4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I love dining at the bar by the outdoor patio for lunch.  Jerry the bartender has a great sense of humor, which really makes the experience. The seafood crepe and the chicken and mushroom crepe are fantastic.  It is so pleasant to relax there and watch the world go by.  My favorite bar in Vegas and I get Lettuce Entertain You points!
