6Hj4AQ5DDGf7tsVk6LscLQ I think the reviewer who called the previous establishment 'bohemian' meant  to say filthy. The restaurant that previously occupied this space served one single function, patio beers. The one time I stepped foot inside, I was grossed out and I would not dare order the food, inside or out. Good riddance! 

25 Liberty is a welcomed improvement. The food is decent, the interior is lovely, and the service is attentive and efficient. What impressed me the most was the cocktail list, not many places nearby to get a good cocktail, except for Origin. Mildred's can sometimes pull through, but all they really have going for them is their pricing. 

HOWEVER, make sure the bartender is there before getting too excited.. without him all they can muster up are caesars, mimosas, beer/ wine. Which could enrage a lot of brunch-goers, like myself. 

Their dinner menu looks promising as does their wine list. But, as far as brunch goes, 25 Liberty is a welcomed addition to a neighborhood that's otherwise lacking in (good) dining options.
