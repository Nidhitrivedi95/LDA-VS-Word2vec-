xaqW4NkmUCGRRjmLxiFJ6Q Yum! The husband and I saw the good Yelp reviews and came here after playing at the nearby VR game room. We ordered the simplest sweet crepe on the menu, the Pomme (apple, honey, peanut butter) and the original sugar cane juice. The crepes are presented fresh, wrapped, and upright on a metal stand - hot and easy to eat, which gets points in my books. The juice reminds me of Taiwanese night markets - very fresh (but definitely not as cheap - it's $6 a large cup).

The servers and crepe makers are very friendly even in the late hours, and the atmosphere is cozy, though too small for large groups and tables fit 2-4. If you're around the area, I'd definitely recommend you to check it out. Next time, I want to bring a friend to try a savoury crepe!
