xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g My baby had made reservations at this restaurant as our one year anniversary dinner at Las Vegas. I'm a sucker for romantic cityscape and skyline views so I basically melted when they seated us right across from the Bellagio fountains! The night view of the busy vegas strip was so breath taking that I honestly can't even remember what I ate or whether it was yummy or not. I highly recommend this place for dinner, or drinks when the sun is down  ;-)
