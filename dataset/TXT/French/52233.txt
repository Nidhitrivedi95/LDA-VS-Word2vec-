My sister got the lunch deal, I got the Chicken Alfredo with the side of Corn Chowder and we also got the trio appetizier. 

The appetizer wasn't great at all. I've had better fried zuchinni sticks and the spinach artichoke dip wasn't smooth. You literally use a fork to pick apart the dip. 

My order that was brought out to me was wrong but it didnt dawn on me till after I started eating it. I was like wait, I ordered Chicken Alfredo Fettucinni and I got some rigatoni dish. 

Service was great but all in all, was quite dissappointed in the food. We walked out with a $45 bill and we figured, we would've been better off paying for expensive food at Sammy's Woodfire Pizza (they never dissappoint).
