rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A It had good service. The food was good, but I don't think you need to spend money to get the quality they provided for the main courses. The appetizers were worth the amount they charged, but the main courses were not. The wine was good. I tried snails for the first time. They made it well. I like the truffle fries. My steak was good, but I have had better at Texas Roadhouse. The salmon my friend got was over cooked.
