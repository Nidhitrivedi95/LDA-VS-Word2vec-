aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw Chocolate Croissant: I had it at room temp, wish it was warmed. It was large and filled with an adequate amount of chocolate. It was a little dry to my liking. 

Raspberry Cream Puff: BIG AF. It was delicious. The vanilla custard cream wasn't overtly sweet, just right! The puff was light and airy.
