xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g The staff is obnoxious, snotty and rude. We arrived 50 minutes before our reservation time just so we could get a good table. They ended up seating is right by the waiting area, next to the elevators. There was so much traffic walking past our table that we couldn't eat in peace. The overall noise level was also unbearable. I felt like I was sitting at hometown buffet, this was definitely not a high class restaurant experience. The food was overpriced for the relatively small portions and we did get two dishes that were cooked incorrectly, one of them being undercooked fish. Our waiter had a bad attitude and was very sarcastic in the way he spoke to us. I will definitely not come back here again. If I wanted to eat at a loud, crowded place I'd drive down to Denny's or iHop.
