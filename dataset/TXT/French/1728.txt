0d6kx6Jlocw77y1J9nbqMA I visited Scratch for brunch yesterday, May 18th.  I had a goat cheese omelette with bacon, and the fetching Mrs. Smith had the Eggs Royale.

The omelette was served with hash browns and a salad, all delicious!  The goat cheese combined with the bacon in the omelette made it extremely flavorful.

But the best thing was the service.  The staff was exceedingly friendly, with just the right mix of checking to see how we were doing and if we needed anything, and just leaving us alone to enjoy our breakfast.
And their smiles made our Saturday.  :)

Please visit Scratch and enjoy!
