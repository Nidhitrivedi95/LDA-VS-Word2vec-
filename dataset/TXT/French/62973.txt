SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA L'Albatros was nestled right next to my sorority house in college. Imagine the temptation for college-aged Candace, who loved fine dining but really should have spent her hard earned work study money paying off loans instead!

L'Albatros is, in short, a superb dining experience. The decor is dark and romantic, the food is absolutely spectacular. I had the pleasure of going here a few times, on dates, for drinks, and as a catch up with my friend and her family. Each time, I was really impressed. 

The prices are fairly reasonable for fine dining. I've been to restaurants that charged much more for food that wasn't on par with L'Albatros, in my opinion.

Although I don't live in the area anymore, I will definitely make it a point to stop by L'Albatros the next time I'm around! It is a culinary experience, and definitely worth a visit (or, rather, MANY visits!)
