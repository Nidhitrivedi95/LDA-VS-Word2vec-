0Xr0kte9ADAfZ-GBO-wimg Le Saint Tropez is a cute French restaurant within the Entertainment District, but I struggled to compare the food to that of France. I came with a group of coworkers, and we each ordered appetizers and main courses to get a good sampling of the menu and use our company's meal compensation. 

First, I had the mussels, which was the most generous portion of mussels I've ever gotten in a restaurant. The bowl was piled high with juicy mussels in a white wine sauce. This was definitely the highlight of my meal, with simple seasoning used to elevate the natural flavor of the mussels. For my main course I had the fish special of the day, but it wasn't particularly memorable at all. Although the fish and a nice sear on it, the sauce was too heavy. The sweet potato garnish just made the entire dish more heavy as well. Overall, I think it's hit or miss here, so be careful what you order!
