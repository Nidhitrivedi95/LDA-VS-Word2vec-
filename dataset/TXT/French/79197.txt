ZdaZwXC0FByDY3EwNELphw I'm a huge fan of the farm-to-table movement and Union does it beautifully. I had one of the best meals of my life here, and loved the warm, friendly, non-pretentious atmosphere. Had the elk sliders and pasta. My partner had the steak and frites (excellent fries). But the whole reason I went there was to try the sticky ginger cake (like sticky toffee pudding) with salted caramel. Divine. If I could afford to eat here regularly, I would.
