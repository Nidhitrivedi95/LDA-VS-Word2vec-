O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q Overall not bad at all. Need a little improvement here and there.  

Petit Plateau De Mer - 4 Shrimps, 6 Oysters, Octopus Ceviche, Dungeness Crab - FRESH. It's the seafood freshness that you can't describe. The octopus ceviche was very disappointing tho - didn't even touch it after tasting it. 

Crab Oscar Benedict - served on a non-traditional bread, but wasn't bad. I almost prefer this bread instead of the traditional English muffin. 

Mussels Marinire - Mussels, Garlic, Shallots, White Wine sauce, side of fries.  The fries soaked in white wine sauce with garlic and shallots made this dish.  However, the mussels were over cooked, the shells were broken and dried out, and the mussel were shriveled.  Since it was over cooked, the white wine boiled away leaving less sauce to enjoy.  So the best part of it, the sauce & fries, was short lived.  If they cooked it just right I'd come back for this dish.

Service - nothing spectacular. They didn't neglect you but they didn't go above and beyond. 

I hate to give them 3 stars but it wasn't a solid 4 star restaurant.
