Or23g875aIDTGNwKQASQgA Enjoyed every bite. Very succinct but excellent menu. The chef brings you your food, and their sommeliere has excellent knowledge of her wine list. She suggested wines we would've never picked but that paired perfectly with our meal. I can't wait for the spring menu to come out.
