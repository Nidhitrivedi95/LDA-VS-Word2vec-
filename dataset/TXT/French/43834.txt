m9aFZk1f8tSv248YErbpQA Had a great brunch here with my wife and two young daughters.  They were awesome to my girls and took great care of them.  The Raisin Croissant was a great item to hold off the hunger in my girls.  Then the entrees were perfect: my Quiche Lorraine was perfect, light and airy yet full of flavor.  The girls Croque Monsieur was nice and crunchy, just the way kids like a grilled cheese...even though it did not look like ones they are used to. My wife had the Lyon sandwich and said it was one of the best chicken sandwiches she has ever had.  Then we finished with a sweet crepe; Nutella with Banana...NUFF SAID!
