qmh6zxtJ8C8-YiUPv7ySlw Man, this place was expensive...but it is the Wynn so I guess that should be expected. The entrees are tiny. Overall the food was decent. There wasn't anything that I really loved and there wasn't anything that was terrible. There were 6 of us and we all shared a lot of appetizers and sides.
