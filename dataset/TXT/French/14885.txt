This restaurant features two levels: downstairs bar room is casual with communal seating, upstairs more traditional seating with booths (I recommend sitting by the open kitchen for a more interactive dining experience). The menu is tapas/small plates style and great for sharing.

If you like dry rubbed, non-fried wings, Rooster's has the best in town!
