4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw We spent our 1-yr anniversary here... excellent service, tasty food.  We definately enjoyed ourselves. It was really noisy inside, but it made it feel less stuffy which was nice. The french onion soup & their warm bread was awsome.  The steaks were tasty, but lacked just a little in flavor. The coctails were very good!
