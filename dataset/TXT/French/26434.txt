D7CnTsm8SCmbQghz1ioPdw Went here for a birthday dinner in Montreal. The food was good, but being from NYC it was really nothing amazing. It was pretty pricey too...my boyfriend had the boar which was 40 dollars. this seemed a little much, esp since it was fairly plain. I had the rack of lamb which was ok, nothing special. Dinner ended up being $230 for 2 people, definitely not worth it. 

One plus is that Fred Savage was dining at the table next to us. That was very exciting!
