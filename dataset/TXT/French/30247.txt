FRuuIDOd21pTJHvEGIt1Gg This has to be one of my top fav meals ever.

Started with the french onion soup.  (it's not just called onion soup in Montreal...?)  Wasn't served scalding, which is good, who wants to stare at their food in front of them for 5 minutes so they don't burn themselves?  Traditional serving with a top layer of bread below the cheese...  cheeze wasn't super stringy, broth wasn't overly salty.

Salmon tartar was amazing.  I could eat a bowlful of this.  Could have included more croustini, but bread is included with service anyway.

Lobster ravioli as the main.  So buttery and delicious, I felt guilty eating it.  My stomach was fighting a battle of being full yet still wanting more.
