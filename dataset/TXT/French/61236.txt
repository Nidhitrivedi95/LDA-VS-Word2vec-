SJCxyB8wZQmgGY1UerStbg Nice farm to table concept and friendly hostess. The interior was quite nice and felt welcoming, I was shocked at how empty the restaurant was. They told us that the ingredients they use are all local. We had the charcuterie and Caesars cocktail. The size of the Caesars drink I ordered is much larger than in Toronto for roughly the same price which was a nice surprise. Towards the end of our meal we had a different server who was quite pushy about getting us the bill even though we were still eating. He even tried to take away our plate despite there still being food on it. Would have given them 4 stars if they weren't so pushy about getting us to leave.
