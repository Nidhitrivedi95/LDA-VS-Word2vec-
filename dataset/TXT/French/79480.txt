Zm49-4emuoqhfb-nOPEYOg Wanted to go to Junior but realized that they are on summer holidays so ended up here.

The place is pretty spacious with seats at the bar, front dinning room, back dinning room and patio at the back. 

This space specializes in crepes ~ bucklewheat crepes. Tried the Griffintown & crepe Suzette. Both were alright.  The owner who works as a chef is also very nice.

Service is ok
Food is OK
Coffee is a bit burnt 

Nothing wow but can't complain it was bad either.
