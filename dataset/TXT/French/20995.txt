AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw Just once I wanted to try a non-Starbucks coffee while on my recent vacation to Las Vegas.  At home, we pretty much only have Starbucks so it's always nice to try other versions when we're out and about.

We ordered two coffees on two separate trips.  The first was an iced mocha, and it was wonderful.  Sweet, but not overly so, just like I like it.  Also picked up a bag of caramel popcorn to snack on at the hotel.  To be honest, I'm not even sure we ate the popcorn cuz our hotel kept leaving turndown snacks for us on our bed every evening.  My husband might've dug into the bag, but if not, it was a pricey little table decoration.

A couple days later we went back to try their hot coffee.  Ordered mochas to go, and while we were waiting I watched one of the cooks make crepes.  At that moment, I really really wanted breakfast except that we'd already planned to eat somewhere else.  The crepes looked like a master prepared them - and perhaps that's true.

But back to the coffee.  You know how Starbucks tastes, and then when you go somewhere that's not Starbucks you feel like the coffee tastes more authentic, like the Italian version of a latte instead of an Americanized one?  Well, this is what you get at Payard - authentic tasting lattes.  It was just sweet enough to cut through the bitter coffee taste (I don't like coffee; it all tastes bitter to me), but not so sweet where you walk around all afternoon with a tummy ache.  And the more you drank it the better it seemed to taste.  It passed the test, and I recommend it to anyone who measures all their coffee by Starbuck's standards.

Kind of wishing I had something to say about their food since they had a pretty decent looking menu.  Too bad I'm not a local, or else I'd visit again (for another coffee at the very least).
