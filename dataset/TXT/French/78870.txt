ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug We came here for a late lunch around 2:30PM.  There were 2 other parties.  No one came by for over 10 minutes with water or anything.  We ordered Salad Nicoise and a 
burger and fries.  The Salad Nicoise wasn't bad but the Tuna on it was warm enough to be concerned about food poisoning.  The fries were little scraps of potatoes unedible.  No one checked on us after delivering the food.  Poor quality food, poor qualit service. Go somewhere else.
