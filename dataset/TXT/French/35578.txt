htQgj-ANQpZGpIpkkrEmyQ Small local restaurant on mainstreet Markham. They serve a great menu of fusion dishes, and have excellent service which makes Inspire an awesome eat. 

We had the udon carbonara and the duck fries. The duck fries came as a generous portion and were topped nicely with strips of duck meat. The udon carbonara had lots of flavour and the toppings were stellar. I'd come back just for this dish! Service was fantastic, I felt like I was in a higher end restaurant because of it. They also have quite a drink selection.

I'd come back!
