d482l58ho0_IMdFkXX1F5Q Second time here.  We came here after having bad customer service elsewhere.  Service here was great. Hostess was polite. Showed us our seat. Then asked us if the table was to our liking or we wanted something else.  Waiter was knowledgable.  There was someone to fill our water whenever it close to half empty.  Had the croque Madame from the brunch menu. $17.  Done
