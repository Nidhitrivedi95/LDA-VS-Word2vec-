Ht-_i0UAq7YDBaqJwcQMdQ Came on a Saturday night a hour before closing. Restaurant is located on a lovely Old Montreal street. Atmosphere was fantastic. Service was top notch.

Braised Piglet Risotto with Frozen Foie Gras Shavings - 4, very rich
Rack of Lamb - 5, very tender
Orleans desert - 5, much tasty

5/5 overall. Great experience. Would eat at again.
