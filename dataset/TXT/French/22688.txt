bzbNGyrTwWHAgg1CqkSgeg Drove all the way down here because I heard they had the best brunch in Charlotte... but my food was comparable to an IHOP. Couldn't even drink the OJ ($4.15) because it tasted worse than what I drink at hotel vending machines. The wait was way too long so we thankfully grabbed bar seats. Really not worth the drive for my omelette and hash browns. Although their homemade jam was good on my buttered biscuit... the only highlight of my visit. And the good service.
