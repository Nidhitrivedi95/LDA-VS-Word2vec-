O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q We come to Vegas all the time and this place is a must stop until our experience yesterday.  We stopped in for a meal and I hurt my thumb on the door.  The manager came over and told my husband that it wasnt their fault and what did we expect him to do about it!  He never even came to see it or ask me anything.  His flippant attitude and arrogance was icing.   Needless to say, we will never go back,  we have spent a lot of money there and it is unbelievable such stupidity from their manager could ruin their Restaraunts image.  If he had handled it differently I wouldn't have felt it necessary to write this.  They want your money and don't care about you.  Don't be fooled.
