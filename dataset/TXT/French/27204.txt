We managed to have an early dinner on a Sunday before there was a single person there to eat, so we sat down immediately and were watched over by the very friendly staff all night. My wife and I both went with the fixed menu and enjoyed every course, from appetizer to dessert. We walked away very happy people, ready to go back whenever the desire for French food strikes us.
