IYreMhkT6e02tsbw-Dex5Q First of all, the only reason I'm only giving Bruneaux four stars is that I've only had lunch there.  I'll update this review once I go for dinner.  
I know I previous reviewer had a bad service experience.  Not so with me.  I found the service to be excellent, perhaps erring on the side of overly-attentive, which isn't a problem for me.  

I had the steak sandwich, "Serenity Hills filet, caramelized onion and fennel, radicchio sauce, topped with fried jalapeño and pomegranate arils on a crusty baguette," and it was absolutely delightful.  The steak was well cooked and the sandwich well composed.  The root vegetable frites were likewise excellent.  The prices were very good for the quality of the food.  

If I had to nitpick, it would be about the decor.  I prefer a more dim dining environment, and this place is white, white, white, and bright, bright, bright.  Again, I'll reassess after I've had a dinner service.
