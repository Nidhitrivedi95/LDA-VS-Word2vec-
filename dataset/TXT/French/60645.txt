SCklYa_jhihWAcfIn-_chg Great place for some early morning goodies! We went out of our way to come grab some pastries and coffee before a long drive back to NY and this was great! The staff was extremely nice and insisted that we sit and take our time to eat, but we had to go. :( Along with our coffees, we got the blueberry custard, a pecan butter tart and a raisin butter tart. They were all delicious - especially the blueberry custard! 

Definitely check out this place if you're in the area.
