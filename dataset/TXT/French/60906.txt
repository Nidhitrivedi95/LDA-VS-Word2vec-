SD7vTf-H00J8BS3L-kt7jg So yes, as my companion and previous reviews suggested, the raw bar here did not disappoint. I remain confused about this place. Packed with reservations from 6-9 we had a meeting with a staff member so they fit us in and we got to watch the place fill up with business men and women with their day to evening outfits. Sexy crowd if you're into that scene and the layout is well setup for the all important sight lines.

The gal at the bar was friendly, laid back and really professional (plus the patience of a saint when it came to helping out the solo guy next to me who wanted her thoughts on every wine on the list.) To be fair the list was extensive and had lots I'd like to try.

The oysters were perfectly prepared, and perfectly fresh. I could have eaten a second dozen all on my own, but propriety and the budget prevailed.. This time..
