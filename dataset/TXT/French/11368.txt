4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw If there was a way to give lower then one star I would. I was extremely disappointed in this restaurant. I had the absolute worst service. I had my aunt and uncle visiting from over seas. I thought the best place to have breakfast with a nice view would be in front of the bellagio waters. I called and made rsvp. From the moment we walked in to the moment we left was a complete disaster. Rude service, 45 min for eggs , McDonald's coffee can debated to be better quality. I asked for bread they brought me a hard stick . I wouldn't recommend this place even if they paid me to.
