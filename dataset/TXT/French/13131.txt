4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw GREAT VIEW. 

THE BREAD WAS GREAT. 

Hashbrowns, steak, and eggs were mediocre. We could of gotten something else cheaper and more delicious. 

We ordered the prime steak and eggs, and it was horrible. The wait was long, and the best part was the toast.

We also ordered the steak sandwich with the dip. IT WAS AMAZINGLY delicious. All the juice and onions blended together. I would definitely reccomnend this. 

I would give this place 3 stars, but the extra star is for the great view. There is also an abundance of staff here. and so if you were to come here I reccomend making a reservation for outside seating.
