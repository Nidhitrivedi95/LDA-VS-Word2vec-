SJo_IjvzdRtCvZVN0cbrRQ This is best breakfast/lunch/brunch spot in Akron. Marked only be the blue entrance door angled towards the intersection (no signage to speak of), its almost like you have to know about it to find it and experience it. They've set out to serve food that you don't make yourself and they have met the challenge. The menu stapes are consistently fantastic and the rotating specials are a level above fantastic. The service is friendly, prompt and courteous and they have made good use of the small dining room.

The updates to the furnishings they have done over the last year have been welcome enhancements to the experience and we look forward to going to the Blue Door for years to come.
