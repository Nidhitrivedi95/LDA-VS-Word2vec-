tAzw8cGIMB9RX8v6Ei7Pfg If you are craving for something with chicken, Coq-O-Bec is one of the place to go in Verdun. It's our version of Au Coq, and Benny.

I went there today, and the food was good. The service was fast, and always done with a smile. As with most of the restaurant in Verdun, they don't have a big dining room, but they also do delivering. It's a good alternative for St-Hubert!
