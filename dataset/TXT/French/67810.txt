UxWH8zRYIBgs6Q2oykvRdw I went here with a few of my girls for winterlicious and generally speaking I had a good time. First off the atmosphere was gorgeous. I was really impressed when I walked in and the Ceiling definitely caught my eye. We tried all three appetizers on the menu. I got the mushroom soup which was okay. My friends got the butter nut salad and they weren't too impressed, I had a bite and we all were in agreement that it was way too salty. The cod appetizer was pretty decent.   I got the trout for the main dish and it was absolutely delicious (I can still taste it on my mouth). Very flavoured and done to perfection.  My friend who cut the chicken crepe enjoyed her meal too. The dessert were pretty well done too. The pear ice-cream was very refreshing and definitely my favourite. Overall I enjoyed this place. I'm giving it a 4 instead of a 5 because of the appetizers and the waitress wasn't the most friendly.  Also we unfortunately had to wait a while before being asked for drinks and what to order and another while to pay.   I will defiantly be back at this place. It seems like the perfect spot to go to for a Sunday brunch!
