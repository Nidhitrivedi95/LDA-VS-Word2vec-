As for the other plates, we tried a few; arancini were our favourite, the gnocchis had too much garlic, the pumpkin was alright but the highlight of the meal was definitely the Parmesan cheesecake. I think it's the best cheesecake ever had in my life. So if you go eat there, you don't leave without trying it!
