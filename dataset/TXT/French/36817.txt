iEsNloJgy-MyA-_wqeB6jg Yelped romantic dinner in my area and Le Sans popped up. French in Cave Creek? Very unusual. It was our anniversary so we tried it.  The outside has a lot to be updated, along with decor on the inside. We almost drove away. We took a chance and were pleasantly surprised. The service was spot on! We had warm potato leek soup to start. Very nice, thick and tasty. 
Then we continued with a house salad with a nice vinegar based dressing and a bottle of delicious white wine.  Main course, petit filet mignon. 
Cooked to perfection. They surprised us with an anniversary dessert. Overall the meal and the service was magnificent. The 70's decor is keeping it from the 5 stars. I would recommend!
