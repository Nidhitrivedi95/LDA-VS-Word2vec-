4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw This restaurant is AMAZING. Went here for my anniversary with my boyfriend and everything was exceptional. 

My boyfriend got the filet in butter (?) Forgot what it was called in French... But SO GOOD. Wish I got that... Instead I got a salmon dish, which was also good but definitely not as mouth-watering as the filet.......darn..... 

Service was great! I want to come back every time I'm in Vegas.... For the filet...... Oh, and the patio seating with a Bellagio fountain show was a plus
