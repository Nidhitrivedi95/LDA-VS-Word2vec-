1LELXxqe2IM2opJbi4dcaA Sandwiches are juicy and delicious, fries are crispy and the sauces are amazing. THE place to go in the AM. But the customer service is even better!

One time I simply asked for a to go bag for my sandwich and fries and remaining sauces. But what happened was this: the server took my tray, rewrapped the sandwich in a new paper, put the fries into a new bag, and gave me new filled sauce cups that had lids on them for the fries. I DIDN'T EVEN TELL THEM TO DO THAT! These guys go beyond what customers ask for. That is truly amazing customer service. 

This is coming from a guy who normally doesn't care about customer service.

That's why I will always tip well here.

tldr; HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
