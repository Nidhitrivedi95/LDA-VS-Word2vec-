0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g First of all...I can't say enough about this restaurant...it is truly my favorite in the entire city!!!! Our Team of waiters took great care of us throughout the evening. Douglas (Som) went above and beyond the call of duty to ensure that we had a fabulous experience. The food was incredible...I loved every course!  And, the wine pairing was perfect! The only suggestion is that they should include a wine pairing with dessert and give the option of upgrading the selection, if desired. Thank you to the entire restaurant..from the Hostess to the Staff in the dining room... This was an amazing evening!!!!
