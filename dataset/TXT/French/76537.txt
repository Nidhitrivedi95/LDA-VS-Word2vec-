Yp9w4nhUowBU_IS_StFXbQ Breakfast was delicious, just expensive, especially for a breakfast.  The service was impeccable.  Located right off the pool area in the Wynn hotel.  I got the breakfast special, which included some delicious pastries to start.  Sadly, my friend didn't like her meal as much and ate most of my pastries.  I'd come back, but it's not top on my list in Vegas.
