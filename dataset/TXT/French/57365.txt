rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I was flabbergasted at how bad my experience was. Not just the service, but more shockingly the food. At $100+ PP (and we ordered conservatively) I would probably never set foot in this place again sadly.

Started off with a clunky server, really scattered and slow. We had to ask for lemons 3 times, asked for a cocktail that never came, we were waiting forever in between courses. It just felt sub-par.

As for food, I will say the salads and the wine were really, really good. The wine list is actually pretty amazing if I am being honest. But that is where the happy times ended. My $44 scallops were totally cold and had sand in them. The steak frites were cold. You read that right, not warm, totally cold to the touch. Which for steak and fries isn't the most appetizing. It isn't appetizing at all actually.  We had to do the unthinkable and send it back to be heated up, and then it went unfinished. 

After this lackluster showing, we skipped dessert and will be skipping Bouchon Vegas ever after. Mon Ami Gabi at Paris hotel blows it out of the water.
