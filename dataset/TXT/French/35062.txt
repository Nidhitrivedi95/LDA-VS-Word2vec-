HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw My wife and I liked this place enough the first time around (after just having drinks and dessert) that we decided to come back for a full meal. Reservations were easy to get and we were seated quickly after arriving.

I love their raw bar. They've got several types of oysters to choose from. We went with half a dozen Kusshi oysters -- one of my favorite types because they're small, yet meaty and a touch briny. The oysters were accompanied by a lemon, some horseradish and some sort of red wine vinegar sauce.

Both apps that followed were excellent. The broth for the French onion soup was rich and savory and filled with large chunks of croutons. The crab cake was a single large cake sitting on a remoulade that had a little spiciness to it and topped with a frisee and herb salad. There wasn't much filler in the crab cake and plenty of meat, but not the large, meaty jumbo lump chunks I prefer. Still, it was a good cake.

We split a whole lobster. Talk about disappointment... yes, it was all the meat from the claws and tail, but it looked much smaller than what we expected for $52. The meat was stacked on top of fingerling potatoes and spinach. We didn't care much for the sauce it was in and the meat had a weird rubbery and almost chalky taste to it. Not something that we would order -- or recommend -- again.

We got a cheese plate for dessert which had three blue cheese and two others I don't remember. All were excellent. The cheeses were accompanied with bread, apples and some amazing candied pistachios.

Drinks were fabulous, service was good, and the view is always great. I'm still a fan. I just won't order the lobster again.
