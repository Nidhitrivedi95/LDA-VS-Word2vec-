fKDyiIcFLkl-_5d4JsvBXA I'm always on the lookout for a good steak. American style, Brazilian, Argentinean, you name it. The French are known for their Steak & Frite. I heard of this Entrecote Saint-Jean a few weeks ago and figured I'd give it a shot. 

Now. If your menu has only ONE item and your restaurant is jam packed like it was tonight, shouldn't the grub just blow me away? I think so.

While the restaurant is a thing of an age gone by beauty, the food isn't. 

It's simple. You get soup, salad, steak & frite and desert... let's go through them, because when I want to crush something I do it step by step.

Leek Soup. Not half bad, piping hot, but severely lacking in the seasoning department. 

Salad. The lettuce hadn't gone bad but some leaves were definitely damaged. The dressing was so so and very rare, as in barely a teaspoon of it for the whole salad.

The Steak & Frite. Now this is where I get bitchy. Firstly if you promise me match-stick fries, don't bring me frozen McDonald's like French fries. Secondly the steak... This is a French restaurant. The French who invented everything about cooking worth a damn, should know something simple, some very rudimentary about steak preparation. Once you take it off the heat YOU HAVE TO LET IT REST. It's the only thing on their fucking menu and they fuck it up. My plate was a bloody mess, completely screwing up the sauce. They have ONE thing on the menu and they haven't mastered it. What a shame.

Desert was the saving grace. Profiteroles, delicious and refreshing. But I doubt I'll be going back. When I don't finish a 6 oz steak, there's something wrong with this world.

The service was good, but never were we asked about how are meal was going, if it was any good. All in all it's a very pretty restaurant, with decent service, but really unimpressive food. I can't understand why it's so packed.
