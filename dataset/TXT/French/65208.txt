u-SvRRAfYgpbXZRfQgcTzA Had an opportunity to visit this lovely establishment last night and instantly fell in love. This place has such a great energy and it doesn't hurt that the imadake ramen is simply divine. Even though we didn't have a reservation they were able to accommodate our party of 3 and we were lucky enough to sit at the bar which gave us an opportunity to see the food prep in action. I was mesmerized by the people who work here. They have endless energy and are able to keep up with their many customers. Everything was so fast, but didn't feel rushed. It's such a sensory atmosphere, stimulating to the eyes and ears. The whole staff was so attentive and friendly. So happy I was able to experience this place and can't wait to go  back on my next visit to Montreal.

Tips:
- Make a reservation so you don't have to worry about getting a seat
- Try the Hello Kitty drink. Very good and not too sweet
