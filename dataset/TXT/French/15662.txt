6fPQJq4f_yiq1NHn0fd11Q When you dine at a crepe place in a hotel that puts "Le" in front of everything in order to seem more Parisian, you don't expect much for a reason. (if you can't tell, I'm not a huge fan of the Paris Hotel. In a city full of cheesy theme-park hotels and casinos, this is probably one of the cheesiest)

Needless to say, Le Creperie met my expectations: overpriced food for sub-par quality.
