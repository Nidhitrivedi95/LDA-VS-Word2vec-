YVYHX7RCPjCBqEth2CS91Q I really wanted to like this place.  
But,
I found I strongly dislike the food and ethical practices here.  They are relentless with the Groupons, which I promise will not make it any better.  Still a rip off.  But let me give a bit of advice if you go anyway (but why would you? there are so many good, decent, honest, delicious restaurants out there, there is not one reason to go here. Anyway) ----  if you order wine, especially a bottle, please insist they OPEN a new bottle in front of you.  They routinely fill good empty bottles with really cheap wine and charge for the good stuff.  Soups taste as though they are made from a condensed can, and i wouldn't be surprised if they actually are. Most foods are frozen before cooked. And don't go hoping to get any specific dish that's listed on the menu or any drink that any normal restaurant would have -- they apparently do not shop regularly for food or drink and routinely run out of most things, including alcohol.  My check was wrong (more drinks charged than ordered, and an app they sent out to apologize for a mistaken one sent before wAs actually charged -- BOth the mistake and the apology one were on my bill.  They Also charged my card twice for our dinner, which I only noticed later on my bill.) i talked to someone else who had the same credit card problem after eating there!

In sum, one of the worst restaurants I've ever been to.  I even tried it again to make sure before I wrote a review (but i ordered much less the second time). Don't believe me? Then look into why La Casa, owned by same person, has been Shut down.
