jo4KmAqlZ7vxjHIP7IIkAw Not good.. Came here for summerlicious and the food was nothing to write home about. The lentil coconut soup didn't taste anything like coconut and the seafood fettucine had small scallops and only 2 overcooked shrimp. The waitress seemed rush to get our orders and barely said a few words to us, it felt like as if we were paying to be an inconvenience to them. The place was hot and stuffy...overall not impressed.
