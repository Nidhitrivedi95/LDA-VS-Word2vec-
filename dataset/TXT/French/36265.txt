i2dnic7VdQ3NyiQQWUXHbA MUST TRY: garlic truffle butter spaghetti with egg! I didn't have much expectation beforehand since I found their menu quite limited in term of choices of dishes. Many people have been telling me how pricey the place is, and Instagram feeds showed me very typical brunch options (average plating too). However, when I got to try their dishes, especially the truffle butter spaghetti, it was like HEAVEN! It is very rich and creamy, the most phenomenal spaghetti I have ever tried! I also tried the blueberry pancake and that was just so so.

The place is quite small and I can imagine that when it gets crowded in the weekend, the lineup can be crazy. Try to go during the week and it should be really okay. I find the restaurant very bright and cosy, but honestly, I find the place overpriced for their food and service. But remember to try the spaghetti! It's so good!
