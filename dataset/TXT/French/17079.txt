9ET_RUNztevq4_OLAX80Gg Had lunch here last week for my birthday. Talk about incredible service, food and overall experience. Once a staff person told us to head upstairs, we were greeted and the hostess took our coats. We were seated immediately. Decor is a classy modern version of a 1960s bistro. Lots of green and brass with banquette seating. Service was excellent. Quick but not rushing, chatty but not intrusive. 
Food was exceptional. Clean, good portions, simply prepared. Cocktails/wine list was lovely. 
Once it came out to the wait staff it was my birthday, they brought a small tray of Madeleine's with a candle alongside our desserts and tea/coffee. Such a nice touch. 
It was a lovely experience and I look forward to going back for a special occasion another time!
