4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Get a seat outdoors with a view of the fountain under the heat lamp (if you're going in FREEZING February like I am).  

And if here for brunch, definitely get the corned beef hash with poached eggs.  It was GLORIOUS!  Definitely the best I've had.  Not too salty.  Eggs were poached perfectly.  All in all, it was a perfect meal to start my day.  Oh...and get a glass of fresh squeezed OJ or grapefruit juice.  Was delicious!

Great service, great food, and not to mention my awesome company.  Will definitely be back!
