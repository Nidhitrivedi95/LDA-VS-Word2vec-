ovtlrcsVRlgZZQUlHs_ovw We reserved an outside table for two (anniversary dinner) and when we arrived outside was closed. The host gave us a little table next to the entrance instead but we asked for a different location so he seated us inside the restaurant. Not a lot of choices because it's a small restaurant. We ordered wines an appetizer to share. Escargot was barely okay, although very hot (had to wait about 5 minutes to cool down). Then we had to wait for about 40 minutes for our meal which was barely okay. Our waitress was very nice and accommodating for things not going right, and offered a free dessert and comped us for the appetizer. - We had come here about 5 times and we were disappointed a couple of times, but this time it was the last time for sure.
