rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w My first Le Cirque experience was ephipanal. Between the service, decor and the food, I couldn't have been more beside myself. So, when out of town friends suggested we treat ourselves to dinner, I was only too ready to hit this baby up again. 

Sadly, I was disappointed the second time. I decided on the $98 three-course standard (a pretty good deal for an app, entree and dessert at a Michelin star resto). The amuse that started the meal was heavenly....a shot of organic tomato soup and a little crab cake. Delish. The uni risotto, however, left much to be desired. The risotto itself was more than al dente... it wasn't really cooked. The uni sauce in which the risotto sat was incredibly heavy... so heavy, in fact, that it was congealing on the plate. Yuck.  The scallops served atop the risotto were great.. I only wish there were more on the plate. After the risotto, my expectations for the main course were low. Thankfully, the sea bass wrapped in a thin potato skin was great, though the fish was slightly overcooked. Because we were a large group, the 10 of us split a fantasy dessert -- every dessert on the menu. While most of the desserts were ok, the stand out was the grand marnier souffle (the yuzu/passion fruit dessert, however, was a major miss). 

But here's the real rub: at some point during the meal, one of the waiter dropped a dollop of a buttery, cream sauce on the back of my husband's silk shirt. When I asked one of the waiters to help with getting club soda, he looked at me like I had two heads! After discussing the matter with the restaurant manager, he graciously adjusted the check by $50. That said, rookie mistakes at this type of resto are really inexcusable. 

The star of the show was the fantastic sommalier: Frank. If you're lucky enough to be dining when he's working, ask him to share his thoughts about Vegas with you. He is absolutely fantastic.
