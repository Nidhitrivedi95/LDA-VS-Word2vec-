9iy6scMRbs5ue41XRLGEkw My wife and I came here for out anniversary dinner, and we had an amazing experience. The waiters and waitresses were very attentive and the food was delicious. My favorite dish was the pork tenderloin, it was cooked perfectly, the mashed potatoes were nice and "fluffy", and the green beans were cooked nicely. We had dessert at the bar and happened to sit down as business was starting to slow down for the night and happened to sit with the owners. Between them and the bartender Derrick, the just made the experience that much better. They are extremely friendly and hospitable. They really made us feel welcome for the 3 hours we ended up hanging out there and chatting. We will definitely go back!
