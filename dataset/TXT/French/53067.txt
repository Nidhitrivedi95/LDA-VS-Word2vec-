QeFsIMcIFIJcOrpthYL8jg Loved this restaurant, highly recommend if you're in Old Montreal area. We actually decided to go here last minute since it was like right next to the Marriott we stayed in. What a pleasant surprise! We shared  the octopus salad with white beans for appetizer and that was very refreshing and plenty of octopus in the salad. Then, I had the duck confit and my husband had their signature rack of lamb with goat cheese. Now, the duck confit was amazing; super juicy dark meat, crispy skin and just enough duck fat, yum yum yum. As for the rack of lamb, it's their signature dish for a reason; medium rare was cooked to perfection, beautifully seasoned and super tender and delicious even for me who's not crazy about lamb to begin with. And for dessert, I ordered their pana cotta and cappuccino. When they brought the pana cotta out, it wasn't pretty with red raspberry or brown caramel, so I was a bit disappointed. But that initial disappointment disappeared in a flash as soon as I had my first bite. OMG, their pana cotta was sooooo creamy and just perfect with my cappuccino. I'm so glad I went for dessert even though I was already pretty full. But then again, I always have another stomach for dessert. Anyway, good service, amazing food, definitely give it a shot if you're in the area.
