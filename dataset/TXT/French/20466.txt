AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw I feel like Payard is one of the last decent breakfast spots on the strip that won't cost you an arm and a leg. You may have to wait in a fairly long line, but the quality of the pastries and food is well worth it. Additionally, there is plenty of seating right outside the cafe around a beautiful Caesar's fountain. You can laugh as everyone else stands in line for the buffet across the way.

I'm local, and I drive out of my way to get a latte here. It's my favorite latte in town. The coffee has the slightest hint of chocolate notes to it, and you can get it with soy!

Not to mention it's a beautiful little spot to hang out while you are waiting. I always enjoy looking at the Wonka-esque machinery and watching Payard's videos.
