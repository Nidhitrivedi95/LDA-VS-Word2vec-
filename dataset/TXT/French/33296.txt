hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA Been coming here since it opened, I worked in the building across the way. I've had pretty much every pastry and they were and are always excellent! pineapple, apple, chocolate with coconut muffins were all great...made from scratch that same day...everytime! Also love their soups and sandwhiches. Particularly the three cheese with chicken...fresh slices of cheese, chicken breast on a grilled panini. The raisin bread is the best i've ever had. Staff is always friendly and place is always clean!
