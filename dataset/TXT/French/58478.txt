RfsMUrGUJdrpfrU54rmEsQ Wow!  We met at this place for a dinner night out with fiends and it was exceptional.  The waitress was very nice and knowledgable (she came complete with a French accent!).  We had an assortment of bruchetta for an appetizer, then I had swordfish and my wife had the fillet.  Both were exceptional!  So good we stuck around for desert, which we normally don't do.  Strawberry tart and creme brule were the final compliment to a great meal.  Live music in the background provided a nice ambiance without interfering with the conversation.  Loved it and will be back!
