XcWlBj5oQgzKhR7Cxovj3w My wife and I had 1 1/2 hours before our Southwest flight. Lots of time for a relaxing nice French experience. And although the food was excellent, the service was awful. We ordered a wine and a cheese plate to start and a gourmet burger to split. It took 15 minutes to be greeted and have our order taken... And it wasn't busy. The cheese plate came with no crackers and a small serving of bread.... So we asked for more bread-- FOUR TIMES! A 2nd server came finally and said the bread would be right up... But it never appeared! The burger finally came but there was no mustard, mayo or salt/pepper and we COULDN'T GET CONDIMENTS. Now it was time to get in line for our boarding priority AND NO SERVER TO PAY. Of course there were servers standing around everywhere but not ours. We needed the check! Now! So I finally found the manager, asked for a credit for the uneaten cheese plate (he refused but gave us the stale bread that had been sitting there waiting to be served), we paid, no tip and ran to the gate. AVOID!!!
