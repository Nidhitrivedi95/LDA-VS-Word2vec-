-4TMQnQJW1yd6NqGRDvAeA Had the house with some good friends and enjoyed the the patio seating.

Tried 6 appetizers and 4 entrees like we were cool, took food home as the was only 4 of us.

The duck buns, the fried rice were really good.

The owner was very cool knew our friends bought us a round on much not needed tequila as we we're already tipsy, but nice night cap...I think...don't really remember much. After that.
