LQ_gYNs5E10IGFE0NOyD7A Yummy and adorable, with a hip eclectic style. I had read the yelp reviews and was curious to check out this place myself. Boy am I glad that I did. At first we were disappointed by not being seated in the funky courtyard, but it turned out that our table next to the French doors was perfectly wonderful. Our waiter was delightful and helpful. Food was creatively prepared and delicious. The ribs were excellent and fell off the bone. The pork tacos were outstanding. Even my friends veggie sandwich was a standout.  A new favorite. I will definitely be back.
