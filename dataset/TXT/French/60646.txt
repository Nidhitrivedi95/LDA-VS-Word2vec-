SCklYa_jhihWAcfIn-_chg Service is a bit slow and menu not all that exciting, although their specials did look more interesting. Tried the Croque Madam and French Toast. French toast was really good as they make the brioche in house. Croque Madam was mediocre but the house-made baguette was fantastic.
