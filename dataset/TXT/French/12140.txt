4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I planned dinner here with a group of 10 girls for my bachelorette party based on AMAZING experience and great quality food over the last years I've been going here. Unfortunately, this time was not as great and this rating is solely on this weekend's experience. 

Service was horrendous and that was probably b/c we got a crappy waitress. She was not around when we needed her to fill waters, ask for extra plates, and check up on us.  She was very pushy for us to order dessert and throughout the whole time did not really smile and was not friendly. 

While some people enjoyed their meals, one of my friends ordered salmon and though cooked correctly, the quality was not great.  In addition, I ordered my filet medium and it came out medium well and dried.  I found myself chewing on the steak when really it should melt in my mouth. 

I may come here again because this was the first time of 20 times that things did not fare well.  But, my next visit to Vegas, I will also consider seeking other steakhouse first.
