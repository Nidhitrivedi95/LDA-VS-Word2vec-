SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA Service was great, and the food was tasty, but I had an experience that left a bad taste in my mouth. My bill came out to $23 and some change, and I paid cash with two $20 bills. When the server came to take my payment, he asked if I wanted change.... really. Sorry, bud, it was good, but not tipping 75% good. Then, when he brings me my change, he kept the coins for himself and gave me only the bills. If this is customary at upscale restaurants (or those that are trying to be) then I'm not "A-OK" with that, and that's why I'm giving L'Albatros a 2-star rating. I wasn't going to make a scene over 70 cents in front of my party, but I needed to share this experience so others are aware.
