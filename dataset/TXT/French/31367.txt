gh6__q2WXFuyN8gt6VAnWw Amazing food, I recommend ordering the house appetizer famous chourisso, best sausage you will try in Las Vegas comes to the table on fire, such a cool presentation. As for dinner you can't go wrong with the espetada de pork. The atmosphere on a weekday night is delightful. Staff is very friendly and always willing to help.
