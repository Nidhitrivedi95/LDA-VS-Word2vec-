SJo_IjvzdRtCvZVN0cbrRQ I really liked the mission statement of The Blue Door, and found the restaurant to be an extension of what the owner's values regarding their commitment to using local ingredients to create innovative, yet simple dishes. I will certainly be back to support this locally owned business. 

The servers were very friendly and helpful, and even though there was a bit of a line on a Saturday morning, they seemed to get orders out efficiently and we didn't end up standing in line for more than ten minutes. 

I ordered the grass fed steak sandwich, which was amazing the first 5-6 bites, but as I ate the second half, I was "over it". I think it may have been due to the fact that the bread had become soggy and there were several slivers of the meat that were too red for my liking. The cup of chicken soup was underwhelming and expensive at $3 for about 4-5 ounces of soup. My husband's french toast was delicious and he ate the entire thing. We took home a fresh loaf of ciabatta, which was perfect in every way.

I look forward to returning and trying more items on their menu, specifically their breakfast fare, since it seemed to be the most popular and all the orders coming out the kitchen looked delicious.
