4O8fzz9F-XEsQ-gTMgkiyQ Stopped in on a snowy evening and was greeted by Joey who was eager to served us the mussels we've craving for a few days in Montreal.  Both Joey and the mussels did not disappoint with a flavorful tomato base with green olives.  Frites were crispy but I wished they were the long thin variety, good nonetheless.

The Mahi Mahi Carpaccio was amazing with micro asparagus and a nice delicate vinaigrette on top of two slices of eggplant.  

The four tapas assortment equally great mussels salad, duck confit, seafood mousse was good but slightly bland and a honey cheese.

Enjoyed our first time at Les Pyrenees.
