Food - I love eating here for breakfast because the Eggs Benedict and Poached Eggs dishes are one of the best I've had.

My only biggest complaint and they should know this already but every time I get hash browns it's always cold, I always have to ask them to remake it. It seems the hash browns are premade and always kills the breakfast mood. They should know that everyone loves fresh cooked hash browns!!!
 
Overall, still love coming here in the mornings to sit outside the patio for the view of Bellagio and the city center.
