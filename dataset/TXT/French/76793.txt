ysJo5Jdo29XOBCnKrbUKWg First, this place is light-years ahead of either location of Crepes Parisiennes.  Managed to make it here this past Saturday for dinner.  The wait was rather long, but I would say worth it.  The savory crepe filled with ham, Swiss cheese, mushrooms, a fried egg, and tomatoes was excellent.  You get either soup or salad with it, and I opted for the ham and corn soup which was good.  

I did not get to try any of the sweet crepes, but I saw people just coming in for desert.  They do have daily specials in addition to the crepes, but they were all sold-out by the time I arrived.

I highly recommend giving this place a try.
