I've been going to HoT on and off for years and it used to be ok but this last time the service was horrible, drinks tasteless, and food cold. I went last night with 3 friends and the place was a ghost town. Our waiters and waitresses were slow and seemed to have no training.  They reached across each of us every time they brought food or drink. We overpaid for a dismal and very mundane experience.
