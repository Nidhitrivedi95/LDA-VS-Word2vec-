BS0GcQ1kUag8YJ2qcBH2lQ I was only just introduced to Caren's this past summer and have gone three times since. They have a cozy patio out back and a small one out front. 

They have a small menu and everything looks good. The Mac and cheese is to die for. I opt for the gluten free version and have added lobster for additional decadence. I tell myself I'll eat half and take the rest with me and the next thing I know I have eaten the whole thing. 

They are incredibly accommodating for gluten free needs and adapt wherever they can. The eggs Benedict on tomato (instead of the English muffin) is highly recommended.
