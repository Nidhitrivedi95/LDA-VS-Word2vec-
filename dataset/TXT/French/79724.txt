zqNgwQjj0_XAll-neGikIw Stopped by this nice little neighborhood cafe for Mother's Day Brunch.  Comfortable atmosphere, very authentic, and the food and service were AMAZING!  I've been to France and this cafe makes me feel like I'm there again. The Croissants are flaky, light and delicious, the omlettes and Eggs Benedict were great, and the breakfast sandwich combined their fresh omlettes with a delicious croissant for a breakfast you can't miss.  They use farm fresh ingredients (cage free eggs, organic produce) and focus on quality at very reasonable prices. Also, try their Chai tea latte and expresso, both very good as well!
