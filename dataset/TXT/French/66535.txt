uP3H5bcsiTXM0k0xQhRndg Went there with my boyfriend a couple weeks ago and it made me really disappointed. We read a lot reviews on yelp, so we went there with a very high expectation. However, the food was just average. 

My boyfriend had the mac and cheese, which was not as good as the comments are saying.

I had the pork belly. It tasted great on the beginning, but after a couple of bites, it started to cloy. 

We also tried the soup, it was a very normal soup which you can have anywhere.
