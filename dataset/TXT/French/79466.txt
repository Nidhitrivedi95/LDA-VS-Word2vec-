Zm49-4emuoqhfb-nOPEYOg I don't like overselling places, but I can't find much wrong with this amazing place. 

When you first walk-in, it comes off as small or cozy. Luckily there is another room at the back, because this place is too good not to be popular. 

Purely by accident, my girlfriend and I stumbled across Spanel when looking for another restaurant for breakfast/brunch. We rolled the dice, walked in and fell in love. We sat at the bar area, which gives you a first-hand view of how their delicious crepes are made. Prepare to drool as you see these delicious creations come together right in front of you.

We went the savoury route, me having the "Quartier Latin" which is a crepe stuffed with various meats, emmental cheese and lots of love. My lovely girlfriend went for the "West Mount" which was made-up of duck confit, mushrooms and all sorts of awesome.

At first we thought the service was a bit slow, but after overhearing a conversation it turned out they were short-staffed that day. Still, as soon as the staff realized we were waiting to order and had been for a few minutes, they were more than helpful and punctual. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt on this one.

The details are what make a restaurant something special, and I think the warmed milk/cream they serve even with their brewed coffee is exactly that - a small detail that puts them one rung higher on the ladder than the competition. They have a full espresso and specialty coffee bar, too, if you're looking for something specific.

We didn't try the sweet crepes they offer that day, but I can tell you this: the next time I'm in Montreal I will be back and I will make a mockery of myself stuffing myself with crepes of all types.
