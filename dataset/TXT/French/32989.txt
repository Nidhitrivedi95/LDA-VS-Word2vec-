h5nqSouJ2cIVXDIIs_V5Pw I came last Saturday with my partner for lunch with a voucher. I hadn't been recently to a "heavy-style" decorated restaurant, tall ceiling, old style, wood everywhere and it was a welcomed change. The photographs on the wall of this building from a professional photographer were giving me tips for my future style :-) 

Now, to the important bits: food! The service was very friendly and quick, attentive. 

We started with smoked salmon, and pumkin ravioli, so pleasant and rich to the palette. Proper bread was served earlier on with the butter in the right room temperature. 

Our mains followed not long after: the glazed pork belly was divine! It melted in your mouth! It was combined great with coconut and chilli rice. 

My partner opted in for the sea bass: they had added some mild spicy seasoning which tasted really great. 

I did like the house wine. 

I am not that experienced with this style of restaurants in Edinburgh, this is definitely though one I would recommend!
