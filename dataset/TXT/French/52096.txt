pmrHuQiy25xKB86tbOLBlA Food and service were what should be expected by a restaurant of this caliber - HOWEVER - the attitude of an much older woman with a British accent could be changed and hopefully the owners will have a word with her!!  Very rude and the main reason for the one star.  I would consider returning  BUT only - after I run a spy pattern to insure this Downton Abbey understudy isn't in the wings.
