rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Finally made it to Bouchon on Sunday with my girlfriends. The Steak Frites was fabulous -- so tender and flavorful, thicker than I expected, and perfectly cooked. Two of us got steak so our helpful waitress suggested we switch one of the sides of fries for something else so I got the haricot vert which were slightly over cooked.  :-(  On the other hand, the fries were fabulous and one serving was definitely enough for all 4 of us to share!  LOL!  For dessert, we had the "doughnuts" but they were nothing like any other donut I've ever had.  So good, it just melted in your mouth!  The cream filing was to die for!!  I would have given them 5 stars except that my friend's Croque Madame was way too salty.  Would definitely come back and looking forward to trying the Bouchon in LA.
