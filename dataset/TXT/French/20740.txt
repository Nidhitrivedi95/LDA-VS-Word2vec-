AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw The food was delicious and the service was awesome! I came here for a business breakfast and they were really busy. We waited about 15 minutes for a table for four people and it was worth it. I got the brioche French toast with sautéed bananas and Nutella. It was amazing. My brother said the steak and potatoes with eggs was also really good. I was very pleased with the service. They kept our waters and coffees filled and took our orders promptly. They checked on us a few times throughout the meal and brought our check in a timely manner.
