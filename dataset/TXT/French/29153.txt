What a weird location - a French restaurant in Chinatown - hahaha! I love it!

The Cassoulet is soooo good! Absolutely delicious. Hearty and rich and hot - a great meal especially in the colder months.

The duck 2 ways is also a tasty option. Crispy duck confit and seared duck breast is full of flavour.

The dinning room is small and can get quite noisy, but everyone is having a great time so you won't mind.

The servers have a little bit of attitude...but that's ok - it's a French restaurant - it's expected!

Check it out and bon appetit!
