gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg We were visiting Montreal and checked this place out. My wife and son got burgers and they were very happy since the burgers were cooked the way they like them . Often, my wife deals with undercooked burgers at other establishments and has to send them back. I had the chicken bacon poutine, which is a Quebec dish of fries topped with pulled chicken white meat, bacon, cheese chunks and grazy. It was very good and it's too bad one cannot find this in Boston, at least that I know of. I had an IPA and my wife a Belgian wheat ale since the 3 brasseurs is a brewpub. Both beers were good though unexceptional or challenging. I am used to IPA's with more character though perhaps Canadian/Quebecois tastes are different and these beers fit the bill up north. The service was very good, best I have had in a long time, anywhere.
