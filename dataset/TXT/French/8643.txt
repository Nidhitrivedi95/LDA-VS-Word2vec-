4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Hard pressed to find a better patio on the strip, we ate lunch here three times in two days.

Good sun, good people watching, and affordable.

Two days in a row we prevented hangovers from taking hold with bloodies, Chardonnay, and strong vodka tonics. Yummy.

Stay away from the soups, and focus on the steak offerings, just sayin'.
