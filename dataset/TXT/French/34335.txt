HL6ZzGF7V-KDaU0zziHyEA Been here for Mothers' day once and now trying dinner. Everything was delicious and surprisingly light for French cuisine. Was good not to roll out of French restaurant for once. There were eight of us for a Birthday meal and not one of us had a complaint about the meal. Just lots of ooohing and aaaaahing. And I hate fish and only realized after I was given my soup there were bits of crab in the soup. It was still delicious! :)
