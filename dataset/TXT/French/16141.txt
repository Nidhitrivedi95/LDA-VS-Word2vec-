78TC3sZSYBzBsSJ0z5pyhw I've eaten at Le Provencal in Paris casino Las Vegas twice and was very impressed.

I have some food sensitivities and I asked the hostess if the chef could alter one of the dishes. They brought the head chef out to speak with me and he was able to make a modification for me. When my food was brought out, the chef came out to confirm that everything was ok with respect to my special request.

Anyways, both times the food was excellent. We ordered garlic bread, pastas, and salad. As mentioned above, the service and attention to detail was very much appreciated.
