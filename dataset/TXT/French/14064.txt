58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw Great brunch spot, I had the Nordic and it was spot on! The poached egg was perfect, the salmon was fresh, and the best part was that there was a balance of flavors! The ambiance of the whole restaurant was also great. Certainly worth every nickel, because Canada no longer has pennies.
(BTW this place is English friendly )
