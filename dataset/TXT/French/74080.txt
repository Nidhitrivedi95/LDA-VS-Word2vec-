xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g I am really disappointed by my experience here last night.  I had my wedding reception here a few years ago and always recommend it to everyone for their "flawless performance."  The night started out bad when we were told that we had to check our nice bottle of (Napa Cab) wine, despite the fact that it does not say it on their web site visibly and when we searched for it on other sites they said it was allowed.  The wine we ended up ordering was nowhere near the quality of the wine we brought.  None of the hosts were very friendly or warm, but I'm assuming that is part of the ambiance.  There was a huge burn mark from a plate on our table.  I asked for the sauce for my steak on the side and it came out covered.  The restaurant is disconnected from the hotel so if you're hoping to add points to any reward card, think again.  The site does say that a jacket is encouraged but clearly not enforced since I saw torn up jeans.  The final end to our evening was the elevator hostess looking like she wanted to hit someone.  When I tried to cheer her up she only scowled at me.  Maybe she was feeling the Parisian vibe as well.  Overall, it was an incredibly expensive evening that was far from the perfect experience I'm used to here.  Sadly, I won't be coming back or recommending it in the future as I had done. 

To be balanced, the bus boys were wonderful and the quality of the Filet Mignon was quite high.  However, I feel you can get that in other areas on the strip.
