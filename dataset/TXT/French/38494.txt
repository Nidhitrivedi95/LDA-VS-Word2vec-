JJ1Ruu37kn66YSWUmCKNCw Oh come on now!  I am shocked by all the good reviews.  The restaurant isn't too hard on the eyes, but really that's all it has going for it.  I know some people are excited because you can bring your own wine, but so what?  This most certainly isn't the only place that offers this, yes even in Toronto never mind Montreal where this concept has been familiar for ages.

The food was pretty crappy.  My partner's peppercorn tuna had no peppercorns.  Worse yet, a good part of it was inedible, full of gristle.  I had a taste and wished I could turn back time and decline the offer.  YUCK!  The swordfish I had was better, but had almost no flavour.  In contrast, the veggies had too much nasty flavour.  I'm betting it was MSG or some other additive.  Though I didn't have a full out allergic reaction, my stomach was queasy after; ergo, I deffo conclude "flavour enhancer".  Yes the portions were large, but bigger sure as hell doesn't mean better in this case.
