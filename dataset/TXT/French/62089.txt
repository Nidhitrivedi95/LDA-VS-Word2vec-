SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ I have been to House of Tricks each time I am in Phoenix on business and they have always accommodated me without a reservation. There have been days where they were completely booked but still found me a table. 

The food is definitely a grade above the ambiance, which is stellar, to which a foodie can only appreciate. The last two visits I had the entree special. In may, I had slow cooked braised short ribs with a corn and garlic & jalapeño grits compote. The meat fell off the bone effortlessly and melted in my mouth. Outstanding flavor and portion size. 

Last night I had the hanger steak special with shiitake mushrooms and roasted red potatoes. Cooked to my preference perfectly and left feeling that I wish there was more. 

Service is always good and everyone is polite and presentable which adds to the charm of this ASU local establishment. Atmosphere is causal but in a way that complements any occasion. 

I will be back and recommend to anyone who wants a great meal with a diverse atmosphere.
