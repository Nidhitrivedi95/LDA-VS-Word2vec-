gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg Arrived in Montreal this afternoon, we were starved and looking for somewhere to eat, we choose this place and we were not disappointed the menu as a newspaper was very cute idea,it was a wonderful lunch, we both order the flat bread and it was very good, this was a true flatbread super thin.. It is a large order for one person you will more then likely have left overs, to re-live the lovely lunch again :) 

The service was good and atmospheres was cool and relaxed price was reasonable felt like we got value for our dollar for sure, I hope to have a couple pints before the end of our trip :)
