rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w BF took his best friend and wifie here for his 40th b-day dinner.

Ambiance: fantastical and resembles the Cirque du Soleil theme full of colors. Its like dining on a beautiful canvas. 

Food:  La nourriture était magnifique et délicieux. BF and I shared the duck. It was so flavorful and juicy. We each picked a dessert and share among the 4 of us. 

Overall: it's one of the most memorable meals I've had. We attended the O show after dinner.
