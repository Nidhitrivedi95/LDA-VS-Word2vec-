Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA I went to MiX with a group of people on Valentine's Day. We opted for the "Mini Table Service" which included a small bottle of Grey Goose and two carafes of mixers. I believe the cover to get in was $20 per person, but for $120, we were able to get the table service. 

Toward the end of the night, our waitress dropped off a partially finished bottle of Grey Goose at no additional charge. (Her tip went up accordingly.) For some reason I ended up doing the worm on the dance floor. And I can't even do the worm! Thanks Goose!

The view is to die for. The patio/balcony was not open because of the wind. The music is good. The strange brain-like sea anemone above the bar is quite lovely as well.

The views from the bathroom are also excellent. Standing at the urinals, you feel as if you're pissing off the side of the building. The bathroom attendant told me to simmer down after I screamed, "I'M THE KING OF THE WORLD!" while standing at the urinal. (Thanks again Goose...)

Check this place out. You won't be disappointed!
