8ciT6qjI18x9EPtOb-gqYQ Went there for my wife's birthday tonight. What a great little place that is actually and 1930's home. We were lucky to be served by the owner tonight. I had the Arugula and Tomato salad which was very delicious. Everything about the salad was fresh and tasty. My wife had the Lobster Risotto and i had the house special, Lamb Shank. The Lamb shank was quite different than what i may usually order, and i was very pleased with the dish. The lamb was so was so tender, and mixed with the vegetables and couscous, just melted in my mouth.  For dessert, we had the banana brulee, and the owner, Ron, was thoughtful enough to bring it out on a birthday platter with a candle.  I would definitely recommend this charming little French Bistro.
