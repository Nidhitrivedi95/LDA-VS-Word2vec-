nKeGPmH5dYNVL5AyAItuKg Chantecler. : a breed of robust general-purpose fowls of Canadian origin. As the name suggest we had to try the stuff chicken it was really good nice and moist and tender it was cooked well and taste was good just a little salty.  We also enjoyed the slow roast pork and sausage if you like meat this is a good casual place and staff is nice too.
