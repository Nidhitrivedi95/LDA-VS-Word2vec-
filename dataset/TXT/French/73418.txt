xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g Wow!! This place was absolutely amazing! So we took the elevator up with a gorgeous view of the strip. We requested a table for two facing the Bellagio. We got to enjoy the water light show throughout our dinner. It was spectacular! We checked in for our reservation early, soft music in the air, we walked in & it smelled incredible! Since we were early they showed us to our table early and we got started. We were sat by Angel, she was very nice. (I have to mention that all of the hosts were dressed beautifully & all of them were very nice!) Maria, our server, shotly came over & got us started with drinks, explained the menu to us & got the show on the road! The start by brining you soup that cleanses your pallet. Then we started with the seafood platter & they brought over the best fresh bread! My husband ordered the salmon and I ordered the Queen filet mignon we didn't decide to get any sides because we had already ordered so much food. (Keep in mind all of the menu items come ala carte.) Our dinner got to our table and we were both blown away! It was amazing! Cooked to perfection & seasoned perfectly. The flavored were incredible! We get through dinner & I ordered the créme brulee . First Maria came out & wished me a happy birthday & brought a beautiful plate from the chef that said happy birthday along with my créme brulee. They were both so delicious! Lastly Maria brought us over an array of fresh made candies & seriously they were the best candies I've ever had in my life! It was such a beautiful dinner. I couldn't have asked for a better birthday dinner! THANK YOU MARIA! You really made my birthday dinner so special!
