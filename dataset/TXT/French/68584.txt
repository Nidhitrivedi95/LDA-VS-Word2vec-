vLkKorA1gPS97Zj0_WKA0Q Singularly my least favorite meal in Vegas ever - bar none.  We had the full tasting menu with wine pairing.  Had full on palate exhaustion and indigestion by 2nd course.  So many fabulous places to enjoy in this great city...take this off your bucket list...

I've never eaten anywhere that made me resort to childish food sniffing before I decided to put it in my mouth... not a single dish made me think, wow, how delicious, how interesting, how fun -- I pushed most away, didn't like the wine pairings - most of which were twist cap, by the way... everything was overly sweet.  l

We were just miserable, left exhausted by the experience which started out not with a warm welcome to the restaurant upon arrival and an introduction, but 'you want some wine?'   ???  wtf.  

Cooking technique was perfect -- of that, there is no question.  I really think, if you do come here, ordering a la carte, must be the way to go.  Then you can create your own menu of their dishes which clearly use lovely ingredients but are more simply prepared and straightforward. 

We are tough critics, we get that, but I think for $1000 check for 2, this should be perfect, in every way.  And it wasn't.  Not even close.
