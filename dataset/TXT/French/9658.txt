4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw This just might be my new favorite restaurant in Vegas!  We came here for lunch, after reading so many great reviews, and were not disappointed.  I wish I was hungrier because so many things looked so good, but I only had the French Onion soup, which was really good.  My husband had the chicken and brie sandwich, which was awesome.  We'll definitely be back!
