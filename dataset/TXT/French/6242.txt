4cWrtMvfj-tomyEPgP7KFg Franco Sarto sandals....overpriced usually ...classic yes....sumptuous yes....same with you my sweet MP. I have only been to this location and do love everything about it....just once or twice a year tho. The food is out of this world and the $30 restaurant week pricing is just right for this Goldilocks. I am not a huge eater so I feel like if I go at full price I cant possibly get my money's worth.  We received four fantastic courses for this just right price. 

I was here this past Saturday and this visit was no exception. Great service and excellent food. Our waiter was very funny and amiable. I got the Caribbean and all of the meat and seafood was super high quality. The wine list is divine (great beer selections too!). I left smelling like stew and looking like I had a fresh facial from all the steam....all good things. Cant wait to see you again next Restaurant week my sassy splurge!
