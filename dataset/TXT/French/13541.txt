4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Mon Ami Gabi is a French restaurant in the Paris hotel. We ended up booking some early reservations there on a night when we had no dinner plans, and were SO pleased with our dinner. We ended up getting out to eat on the patio, no problem. It was rather crowded, but we still had a good view of the Bellagio fountains. They also have heat lamps, which made it cozy since it was a little chilly outside.

I love bread so much that sometimes I fill up on it before my entree comes out. It was very difficult not to do that with Mon Ami Gabi's bread! The bread was delicious, and the butter was AMAZING. I said to my husband, "This is like...super butter." Very very buttery and yummy. Phenomenal.

I selected the skate fish for my entree and my husband selected the beef bourguinon. I thought the skate was very good - well prepared and light. The beef bourguinon was INCREDIBLE, though. Tender beef that must have simmered in the sauce for 12 hours. Rich and delicious.

We were stuffed by the time dessert came around. Looking back, we really didn't eat a lot - we didn't get any appetizers or dessert, but it remains one of the most satisfying meals I've had. The service was outstanding, as well.
