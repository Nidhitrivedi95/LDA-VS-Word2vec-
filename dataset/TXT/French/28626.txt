eJ9L40jm5VOXCIq7xs9kQw Great looking place, great ambience but food very disappointing. Read all the reviews raving about the food, for a top restaurant the food is not more then OK minus. Had the fois gras to start meh pretty dull taste. main was the scallops it was fresh but again very dull taste pretty boring meals. presentation is nice though. truth is, i will not go there for dinner again.
