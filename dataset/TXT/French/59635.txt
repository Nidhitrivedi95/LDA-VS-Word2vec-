s1NqIkLMCFX6PuTk6wt6QA So we arrived in Montreal late on a Friday night, and a relative brought us here. As soon as I spotted it, I fell in love! It looks like this is an actual diner from the 40's (they've kept the visual integrity/consistnacy of it. They have booths (!), the interior is fantastic and the staff are friendly and professional! Oh, and did I mention? I had the lamb burger - ABSOLUTELY THE BEST BURGER EVER!!!!!!!!!! Juicy, tender, succulent. MMMM!!! And the fries? Well, I'm not really a french fry person (I'm picky - need em well done, crispy exterior - none of that fakey mashed fast food inside) and they were great! Oh and they also serve you Coca-cola in those cute little (Coca-cola) bottles for an even more authentic experience. The prices are good as well. I want their burger now!! I can't want to go back!
