4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw My husband and I come to Las Vegas every  year, and dinner here is a special treat.  The food is great, a good value and the service excels each time we visit.  Kudos to Brooke, our server, who made our dinner that much better.  The front hostess was on the ball.  I recommend this restaurant highly.
