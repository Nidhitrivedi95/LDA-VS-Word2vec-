0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g Lovely dining experience especially when my husband and I were celebrating our anniversary. Not only did it have excellent service and delicious food, it had a wonderful view of the strip and Bellagio's water fountain show throughout our dinner time. We ordered the pre-fixed menu designation that was really yummy. To our surprise, Picasso's sweet chef Julian Serrano made us a starter dish of a creamy white soup and fried potato whip that warmed up our taste buds to comfort and such an inviting beginning. Our next ("first" on menu) dish was the lobster salad that was light and refreshing....also very good! Then came the perfectly seared scallops on top of a silky mash potato bed and light gravy pool--my favorite of the series of dishes! Another next dish was the duck confit foie gra that was sinfully rich and delightful. Finally, the main dish I had was the sea bass on asparagus was very fresh and yummy. While my husband had a lamb filet that a lot of TLC noticeably in their preparation and taste--so tender. :) We ended with creative and beautifully plated desserts. The chef faves us a tray of additional dessert bite sized treats as another surprise gift to us. This French cuisine experience was wonderful for us as we celebrated 2 years of marriage. On the way out of the restaurant, the hostess handed us another gift from Picasso of muffin treats to go in lovely boxes. I would recommend this spot if you're celebrating a romantic meal and special event. Be sure to let them know upon making reservation what special event you're celebrating. :) Totally hit the spot for my husband and I--the foodie couple!
