2B46bRpDh49eDyjXGhL_ZQ Maggie is wonderful and her accent is lovely. She makes you feel like you are in her home and eating with her in her kitchen. My wife and I had a wonderful experience and will be coming back for as long as she decides to stay in Las Vegas before leaving for Paris.

Her menu has something for everyone, no matter what you are in the mood for. If you want something hardy and savory, she has you covered...If you are in the mood for something sweet, just take your pick. While we were eating, Maggie stopped by our table to check on us. She explained to us how she imports her flour directly from Paris...and you can really taste the quality, effort, and love she puts into every crepe.
