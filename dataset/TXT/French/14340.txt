58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw Great service. Great food. There is a waiting line if you go around lunch time. But line moves fast and it's so worth the wait. Very bustling inside with locals and tourists alike. Best brunch quality- big platter in huge portion and delicacies not offered anywhere else like salmon cake etc. The crepe in the "sucre" brunch is handsdown the best. If you come from the US, this is a completely different and better brunch experience :)
