YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g Several of us stopped in Fleur for lunch exactly four days after the 1 October event at Mandalay Bay. We should have gone sooner to demonstrate our support for the Strip and specifically for the employees at Mandalay Bay. 

We didn't expect much to be honest. We didn't come here specially for anything other than supporting a restaurant at this hotel. But we were pleasantly surprised!! 

The service was just perfect actually. Not too much. Not too little. Really just right on. The food was great too. I ordered the farro salad with added skirt steak. It was a solid choice. The first several bites had a surprising level of flavor. In a good way. How do you make arugula flavorful? They did. The steak was really good. Had an incredible flavor like they wood grilled it or something. I should have asked. I would have like some more mushrooms with the dish. But it wasn't to a point of complaining. 

We sat out in the patio area which is something worth remarking about. The atmosphere was lovely. Reminded me of Spago or Palms at the Forum Shops. Although we were inside, it felt like we were in an open air environment. The bar area is built out beautifully!! 

I highly recommend it. Next time we go back I'm looking forward to trying other things on the menu!!
