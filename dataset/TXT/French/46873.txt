nkHaix6KenApS8M-liZsCQ Great place and delicious food... Nice monday special 1/2 off in wine by the glass. We started at the bar... have some wines and some apps... highly suggested the foi gra with the egg and the tempura bacon!!! I'm sure is very high in cholesterol but its worth it! Then went to the restaurant to have dinner  we sat at the open kitchen area. The staff (cooks) were not too friendly... they hardly talked to each other while working...That is not fun! I loved everything that we ordered except for the calamari... the worse I have tried in my life... but highly suggested the Lobster pot pie and the Grand manier Souflle... I can;t wait to go back!
