UxWH8zRYIBgs6Q2oykvRdw First time coming here for Summerlicous dinner! The interior of Cluny is very modern and cozy.

ured since I had an opportunity to try absinthe, let's do it! Let's drink an alcohol that has an alc/vol of 62% ... Good idea? Bad idea? It was fine since I diluted it quite a bit and only drank half... lol I got a Lemon and Black Walnut flavour, but nope. Nope. I couldn't taste any of that.. the absinthe flavour was just too overwhelming (licorice flavour everywhere) to the point where I just started using the drink as a palate cleanser between courses... welp.

I got the following:
YELLOW TOMATO GAZPACHO (VEGETARIAN)
herbed croutons, basil pesto

MOROCCAN STYLE PORK SHOULDER POT ROAST
apricots, fennel, tomato, cous cous

FRENCH APRICOT GALETTE
yuzu caramel and black sesame ice cream

Overall, the food was good and our server was very attentive as to when to refill our waters. Would come again!
