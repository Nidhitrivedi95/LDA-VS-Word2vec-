O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q The hotel highly recommended Morel's, so we made reservations here for my birthday dinner. Apparently they have an amazing wine selection, but I'm not a big vino drinker so we passed. I ordered the slowly braised short ribs, and OH MY GOD it was so good. Really tender and flavorful, with the softest cooked asparagus, tasty delicate mushrooms, and a delicious sauce that I wanted to lick right off the plate. The boys ordered steaks, which melted in your mouth. The corn was really good, and the macaroni and cheese sooooo good. We didn't have time to sample the desserts as we had to go see a show, but I would definitely recommend this place. The service was very friendly and attentive, restaurant really posh and modern, and food excellent!!!
