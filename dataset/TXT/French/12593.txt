4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Stopped in briefly for a lunch, using up some LEYE diner points... yes this review is way way late - the actual visit was so long ago, I'd have to look up my checkins to recall exactly when... 

Anywhoo, the service was good and accommodating, they let us park our luggage by the hostess booth area while we ate out in the atrium, it was too warm outside, so it was nice to be in A/C but have the alfresco vibe (which is my preference)... kept it cool with a seafood sampler platter bread and iced teas.

I think this one is much better than the one in Chicago... but that isn't a surprise... its Vegas baby. ;-)
