rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw Oh Bardot how I love thee. Honestly the best food I have enjoyed in Vegas. Excellent and friendly service and am absolutely FAB happy hour until 7pm. The apps were so incredible we never made it to an entree and repeated the same meal a few days later.

Our favorite dishes...
Prime Tartar 
Foie Gras with lentils (so good order your own so you don't have to share, trust me)
Bone marrow
Duck wings

Also the French 75 with gin was excellent and so refreshing.

The vibe is polished and classy but also warm and welcoming. Not a spot to bring your kids. Find it on the 2nd promenade level in Aria.
