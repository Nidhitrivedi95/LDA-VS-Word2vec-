JxtwVeuCBX99KEciymlYXA Outstanding brunch. Their eggs Benedict served over crab cakes was absolutely marvellous, and their house made jam and breads were awesome. My wife had the smoked salmon Benedict and loved it; although the smoked salmon was pretty average, the perfectly poached eggs and hollandaise sauce really made breakfast special. 

The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is the price. It's expensive, but the food is amazing. If you're staying in old Montreal, grab a bite here and you won't be disappointed.
