VwZhwflLnTq19aAeFLJHCQ We went for dinner for our first time on 5/19. It was frank Sinatra night. They played all his songs and had a special menu. We shared the crab cakes. I had the sea bass on top of pesto mashed potatoes and my husband had the hamburger (he's into simple food). I was surprised there were 2 big crab cakes, not just one. It had 3 sauces (all seperated) and all were delish. The sea bass was amazing! It had a lobster wine sauce on it and if I closed my eyes it was like I was eating a tender lobster. My husband enjoyed his hamburger very much. We also had the carrot cake and blood orange mousse for dessert. The carrot cake was good. The mousse was excellent. Even though the prices seem pricy,I felt the food was very well worth the cost. We'll definitely be going back again soon.
