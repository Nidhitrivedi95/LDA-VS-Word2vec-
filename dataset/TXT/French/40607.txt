KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA We have lived in Vegas for 30+ years. We have dined here many times, we have always been pleased. Unfortunately today, although the food was just OKAY...the service was TERRIBLE and our sitting area was dirty...! Their excuse was, kids sat here before you. Not acceptable in my book!
