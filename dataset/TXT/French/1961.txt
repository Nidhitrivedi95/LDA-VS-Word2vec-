0JGMKaKJGVuDus5WcJzvjw Really great food, wine and incredible service. I went with my boyfriend and in-laws and my mother in-law has very particular dietary restrictions. She often encounters a lot of resistance from staff, but the waiter and chefs at Liverpool House were so understanding and accommodating, I was truly impressed. Our waiter was patient, knowledgable and not once made us feel like we were being annoying. The chef even prepared a really cute little dessert that my mother in-law could eat. They made the whole experience so comfortable and pleasant. Really great dining experience, from start to finish.
