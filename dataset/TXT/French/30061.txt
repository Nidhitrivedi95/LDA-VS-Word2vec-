frMGezDOAMWnsBTno2WziA So glad that my friend and I stumbled into this little cute restaurant for lunch on a dreary cold day. It was a lovely surprise, from the great service to the quality food at a good price. They seem to have a lot of repeat customers because the two ladies serving and cooking greeted almost everyone by name. It completely satisfied my crepe cravings and will definitely wander back here whenever I am need of a good crepe.

I got the O Canada, which came as a huge folded crepe stuffed with pulled pork, bechamel sauce and cranberry sauce.... with a side of maple syrup. It may sound weird but it was delicious, a strange mix of sweet and savoury that worked well. The crepe itself was on the thicker side but was perfect since it had to hold up to all the filling and sauce. A great filling meal on a cold day.

The only draw back would be the location of the restaurant. It is quite a walk from both subway stations on a cold day and there isn't alot of parking in the area for the car. But definitely worth the trek on a warmer day!!
