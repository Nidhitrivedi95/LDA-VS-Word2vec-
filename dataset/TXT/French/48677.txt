ohMpNug5zWNxOlL6ShG7Ig Excellent food but after 3 or 4 times of absolutely horrible service by waiters (female) I'm done. These gals seat you then promptly ignore you for 10-20 minutes. Get up and find your own menu, another 10-20 minutes. Finally a guy came over today and took piety on us, I now piety him from nasty looks from the gals. 

It's too bad as its great location, great food just witches taking orders and serving food. One of them must have some authority because normally no restaurant would put up with such abysmal, rude and horrible service.
