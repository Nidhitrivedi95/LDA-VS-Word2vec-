4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Great place for brunch.  My wife had made a reservation and, once again, she nailed it.  We were not disappointed (except for the service, read below).  

We started with a carafe of the Frangria, which is awesome.  However, had I spotted it sooner, I would have ordered the self-serve Bloody Mary bar.

I started with the house-made pate.  It was delicious but the portion was huge.  I needed about 1/2 the portion but it was so good, I ate all of it.  My wife had the Butter Lettuce salad.

For our brunch entrees, my wife had the Ham and Cheese Crepe.  She seemed to like it.  I had the Seafood Crepe.  It was very good but my shrimp were overdone.

Overall, this was a delicious brunch.  I like the fact that our table was in the sun room.  I also like the fact that you don't have to walk through the entire casino to get to it.

One critique.  I don't know what happened but about midway through our meal, our server started ignoring us and when she did come by, she was very short with us.  It didn't start out that way so I'm not sure if we did something or not.  Hey Roxanne, you are the sole reason this isn't a 5 star review.
