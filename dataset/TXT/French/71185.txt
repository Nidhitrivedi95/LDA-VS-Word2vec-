xcmmTXhuMx2fZF2Bt69F4w By far, the best meal we've had in the 'burgh! Our experience was superb! Both of us had moules (each with a different, but equally delicious broth) frites and they were divine. The beer menu was impressive.  We got there early and were able to sit on the porch, which was lovely. It felt very much like being back in Europe for the hour and a half that we were were there. The service was great. My only complaint is that it gets pricey pretty quick. If my bank account wasn't so "limited," I would be back here at least once a week. 
(I forgot to mention we had this UNBELIEVABLE hot spinach, tomato cheese dip that was MINDBLOWING. You have to check it out!)
