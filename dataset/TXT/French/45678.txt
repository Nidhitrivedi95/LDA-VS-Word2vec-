mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q Had a rough start; the staff was unable to get us in for our 8:30 reservation until about ten minutes to 9:00.  They more than made up for it with a large plate of prosciutto and and a shot glass layered with Foie Gras, port wine, and Parmesan foam.  The service from here out was amazing!  4 to 5 people essentially hovering to make sure we were never without wine in our glasses, a dirty dish or fork on the table, or an empty glass of water.  The food was great as well with amazing plate presentation.  Overall, a great experience!
