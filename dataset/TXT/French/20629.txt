AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw I came here after seeing it on "The best thing I ever ate".   I ordered the Coffee Macarons and the vegetable quiche with a chocolate croissant for desert.  The Macarons were excellent, melt in your mouth.  But, the highlight was the vegetable quiche.  It is the best quiche I have ever tasted hands down!  If you go there order it.  I wish I had gone earlier in my trip so I could have sampled everything else they have.  I will be back next time...
