Hmmmmmm okay. Ready? 4  stars for delicious food, awesome customer service and great atmosphere, but didn't get that extra star because they no longer make beignets here. Nooooo!! :(

The truffle fries as a starter is a mustttt! *drools* so crispy and so tasting. My entrée was the spinach mushroom pesto pizza. Againn.. great flavoring and of course it was cooked in brick pizza oven!!!!! Pizza was FLEEK!!!! I loved it.
Oh.. the mac and cheese?!? Uh huh. Simply cheesy and heavenly delighted. Hehe
