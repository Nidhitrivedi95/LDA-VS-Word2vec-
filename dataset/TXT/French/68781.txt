I didn't know at all what to expect, and because the place was packed, my entourage got a table with high bar chairs, that weren't very comfortable to sit on. The menu seemed odd at first, with some very unusual ingredients, but I ended up loving my cauliflower dish big time!

Trendy interior, very nice staff, and super delicious Dark & Stormy (drink). Not the most inexpensive place to have dinner in, but very cool.
