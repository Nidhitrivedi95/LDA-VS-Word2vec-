4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw By far my new FAVORITE restaraunt!!

Heard tons about it so finally my gf and I tried it about a month ago and we have been back 2 more times since then.  We get a bottle of champagne, 2 orders of the Steak Frites and 2 sides dishes (Macaroni and spinach) and for about $100 bucks.  Not bad at all for the quality of what you get!

HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!
