rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A One of the things I love in life the most is BRUNCH! The brunch at Bouchon has to be one of the best in town- definitely the best on the strip. 

They have a large assortment of fresh fruit, pastries, drinks and entrees. I really enjoyed their pastry platter (a chefs selection), and their omelette special, which was ham and English cheddar. The waiter brought over the pastries first, and explained what each one was. They gave us a sweet and savory selection, which was really nice. Both were spectacular. Another item on the menu I highly recommend are the donuts. They are covered in cinnamon sugar and served with berry compote, vanilla, and chocolate sauces. A little decadent for breakfast but for brunch, I'd order 6!

Overall, this place has a magnificent ambience, great service, and wonderful food. Their something on the menu for the savory brunch lover, the "I'm actually gonna order lunch for brunch" guy, and the sweet tooth! Gotta try it at least once.
