xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g I'm really glad that we did this while we were in town and that they had reservations on open door. 

We had a window seat with a decent view of the arc de triomphe. They even offered a shall to help keep warm. 

My friend and I both started with a salad. I had the market greens. The presentation was perfect and I ate every last bit of it off my plate. Next was the queen filet. I ordered it medium well, which I know most places hate. It definitely wasn't medium well, just normal medium, but it was still good. Although I would have expected a nicer place like this to be able to handle it. I also had the mashed potatoes which were very good. Wish I had tried the asparagus to branch out though. 

We finished with the lemon and blueberry soufflé. I was honestly unimpressed. Maybe I would have liked it more if we'd gotten chocolate or Nutella. 

All in all a great experience even if it was slightly pricey.
