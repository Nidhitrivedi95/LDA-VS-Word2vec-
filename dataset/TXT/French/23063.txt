bzbNGyrTwWHAgg1CqkSgeg I decided to start writing reviews again. Here is the first one.

Not sure if the restaurant's name changed. I ate at Terrace restaurant for lunch 4 weeks ago while in town. 

Food:
chicken waffles - flavor is decent, but was dry
BLT sandwich - Looked and tasted as if a 10-year old child made it
Soup - Can't remember what type, but do remember it was lukewarm
Steak fries - Had to chase down the waitress to get it. 5 (literally) bandage-size fries came out on a small worn-out side plate...

Bill - Waitress told us fries was included as a side, but then charged us $5. Had to ask her to remove it. 5 for 5 bandage-sized fries???
