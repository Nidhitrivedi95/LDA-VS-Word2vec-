B56AYe5GNuavMDtwFsXqzA This cute little restaurant definitely has some bragging rights.  Even in Scottsdale where the restaurant competition is fierce.  You name the type of food, Scottsdale has several places fighting for those customers wallets.  With that said I feel that this place won't fail like so many others have.

It's hard to find a better patio ambiance in Scottsdale while the weather is great in AZ.  Enclosed by plants and flowers you'll forget about anything beyond the entryway.  Even the hummingbirds notice how great the landscaping is and frequently will grace you with their presence.  The nice acoustics with french music also lets you forget about the outside world.

The creativity in the food coincides with everything else this place has to offer.  Fresh ingredients and well put together dishes definitely makes this restaurant a place for foodies as well as anyone who just wants a good meal.  The prices aren't to extravagant for the dishes which are on the small side.  This is a place to splurge a little and enjoy some vino while you're at it.  The wines are neatly chosen and I don't think they are to expensive.

Overall I think Petite Maison has created itself as a restuarant that executes well on all levels.
