3FlWR_osNPb8dcqLgHebHw I see the negative reviews but this chain is one I first went to in California and I love it. It is unique for a chain to have a similar friendly staff whichever location you go to but Mimi's does. It is reasonably priced comfort food is how I would describe it. When I was pregnant I couldn't get enough of the tomato basil soup. Great desserts too.
