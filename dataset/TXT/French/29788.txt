FJMMPL3pxAPYGEPB0Hwlhw Food was very good with the exception of the pasta. The spaghetti in the amatriciana was a little too Al Dente, to the point of being undercooked. Other than that everything we had was delicious. The lobster caprese and scallops were excellent. I had the ribeye and it was cooked and seasoned perfectly.  The side of farmer's market vegetables was huge and very tasty as well.

Excellent customer service from our server Ali. He had good suggestions and knew the menu well.  Very courteous and respectful.

This is definitely on the high end price wise but the atmosphere is still very casual and relaxed.  I had a gift card and had told the server before we started ordering just so he is aware. I was worried that we would get differential treatment but this was not at all the case. Great place for a special occasion.
