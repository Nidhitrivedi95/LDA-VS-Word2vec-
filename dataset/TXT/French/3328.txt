1cGyzWtfOoDiE8V0OR85yA I like the extensive option of crepes fillings ranging from more hearty items such as eggs and sausage to different fruits and chocolates. I opted for the crepes filled with white chocolate and raspberries and really enjoyed the pairing. Next time, I'll probably choose to have the whipped cream and walnuts to add a bit more textural contrast.

To summarize a few reoccurring comments from other reviews and from my personal experience: 1) Crepes Parisiennes has short hours, so you should check the hours before you go; 2) they accept cash only; 3) follow the simple rules.
