4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Always our favorite! Great service, great food, and the best view!  Consistently outstanding. Authentic French cuisine. Our waiter, Max speaks French, even though he's from Romania. He made the evening. Scott the manager has been with the company since 2004. Nothing on the menu not worth trying. Get in early or wait an hour. Rarely a line at 5:00 for dinner.
