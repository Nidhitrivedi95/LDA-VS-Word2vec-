dDKhRQlw_OVsPLQAGAeNyA What a gem in old montreal neighborhood.  you'd never expect such a charming, affordable french restaurant that delivers such high quality dishes in the most touristy neighborhood.

Had the watercress soup which was probably potato-based.  My fish of the day (turbot) was cooked perfectly and topped with capers.  So tender and flavorful.  Husband had the calf liver in onion sauce and it was heavenly.  Tasted almost like beef with none of the livery taste.  Onion sauce had a very intense, beefy flavor.  We shared the orange cake and a slice of sugar pie for dessert.
