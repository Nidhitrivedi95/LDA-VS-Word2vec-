sphMzEIqY1I2Dzv3zLZY2g Just an overall great experience. Being from Chicago we are really spoiled by great restaurants but this one can definitely hold its own. Loved everything about it, especially meeting the owner/chef after dinner when he came to check on our meal! Great time, best meal in town.
