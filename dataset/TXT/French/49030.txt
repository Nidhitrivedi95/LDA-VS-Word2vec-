OL_dFyhAt3CVtbbS-DpgUw I'm going to give Hogan's 4.5 stars.  
The bottom line?  The service is excellent, the food is very good, and the staff very accommodating.  Raza (I think that was his name) was professional, funny, engaging, and should probably be running his own restaurant.  He really seemed to care about our party, and was very quick to respond to anything we needed.  The space is very nice, especially the semi-private dining area at the back of the restaurant.  Just watch your head on that chandelier!

My itsy bitsy complaints?  We were given baskets of dense, beautiful bread with frozen pats of butter.  Frozen?!  Jinkies!  That was a bit of a bummer.  Those little plastic containers of whipped butter would have been better than trying to chop bits of butter to sit on the bread.

Also, the mussels weren't great.  They were okay, but I have been to bars that serve better mussels.  They were just too dry, more sauce definitely needed.

The rest of the food was incredible...and don't skip dessert.  It's really good.
