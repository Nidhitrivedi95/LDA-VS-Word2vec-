nkHaix6KenApS8M-liZsCQ The first night we went here it was very quiet and we enjoyed the wild mushroom soup $18. enough that we would return the following evening for another 2 bowls.  The lobster salad $18 was just okay, the lobster was on the tough side.  Dessert was a vanilla flan, not the typical Mexican version, very small, intensely delicious and a larger portion would have been over the top.  Our server, the same both nights, was very professional and personable.  On the second visit the wild mushroom soup was lacking, I believe it to be due to the fact that they were busy with a large party.  Compared to the previous night the soup lacked the number of mushrooms, the foie gras wasn't as seared and so lacked the intense flavor,  it was also not as hot enough, and had too much foam, so the actual volume of the soup was less.  After asking what the truffle frites $9 were, we decided we had to try them.  They arrived hot tossed with a little truffle oil and sprinkled with pecorino.  These were fabulous.  I can't believe that I like fries, what a difference from the American version.   I'll definetly give them a try on another slow night and will sit at the Chef's bar, so I can direct if necessary. Yea, right!
