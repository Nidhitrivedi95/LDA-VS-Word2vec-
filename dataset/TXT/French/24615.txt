cNkm08qu--yjIY_NPxrS2g My girlfriends brought me here to celebrate my birthday. Thankfully, there was a sign and a specific elevator for this restaurant. Elevator took me all the way to summit at 44th floor. When, I arrived at the restaurant; it was packed. The hostess brought to my table. I was glad to be seated by the window. The view of Montreal was spectacular from up here. 

Our waitress came by to take our drinks order; I was little weirded out by their uniform. It is such fancy restaurant, and they are wearing sweatpants and sweatshirts... seriously? She was very nice though.

I had got grilled shrimps with watermelon and feta cheese as an entree. What a delightful dish. It was refreshing, and the spices on shrimps were dancing in my mouth. Then I ordered the burger since I read in Montreal blog, that Les Enfants Terribles have an amazing burger, but I was disappointed with it. It was over cooked that I can taste the burns mostly. In the end, I got the the pudding au chommeur, perfect way to end my meal. 

In the end, we went to observatory section, it was nice to take pics of beautiful crispy night of Montreal.
