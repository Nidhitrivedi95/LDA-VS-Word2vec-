Interesting decorations and lighting makes for a intimate and cosy atmosphere. If you are sitting next to the wood pieces, be careful of protruding nails. All dishes came piping hot, which I really appreciate. Pulled pork poutine came piled high, on the sweet side but nice app to start the meal. The best dish of the night was the udon carbonara, creamy with a bit of a spicy kick. Nuggets of sausage and chewy noodles. Macha fish and chips was okay, crispy but couldn't taste the macha.
