4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw The BEST BREAKFAST IN LAS VEGAS. Reasonably priced and good coffee. Service was great, really friendly, we sat outside which looks over the strip and got to watch everything going on. Defintiley recommend it, I had the short ribs with poached eggs & fruit salad. Lots of range on the men too.
