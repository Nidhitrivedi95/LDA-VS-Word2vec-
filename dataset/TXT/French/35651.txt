htQgj-ANQpZGpIpkkrEmyQ EVERY item I ordered here was AMAZING. 
Yes it is a little pricey for brunch but my husband and I both thought it was well worth it!
We had Chicken & Waffle, Korean Steak Bennies, The INSP Burger,  "Extra Butter" Drunken Crustacean's. I just simply cannot pick a favorite because everything is amazing and flavorful especially Drunken Crustacean's. I love the lemon grass and garlic sauce, we wouldn't let the waitress take the plate away because it was soo good we had to scoop up all the sauce and put it in the fries! 

The Pull Pork fries is def to die for, and you can add money to get that with your burger!
Overall the meal was GREAT and will def come back to try dinner for special occasion. Make sure you make a reservation!
