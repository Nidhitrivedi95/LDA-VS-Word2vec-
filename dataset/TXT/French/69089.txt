w1BbvLeKBSKBnlALLhPmGg We enjoyed our stay at this modern hotel in Leith.

Our room was spacious and comfortable - quite stylish beyond the typical chain hotel.

We ate both breakfast and dinner there, thoroughly enjoying both. The salmon Benedict was particularly tasty.

The service was very good with a friendly and helpful staff.

While the neighborhood has some nice restaurants and pubs, the hotel is 10-15 minutes taxi ride from the Castle and Royal Mile.
