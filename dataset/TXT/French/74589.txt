xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g The view and the food are among the best... second perhaps only to the miX at Mandalay. While I had eaten a very expensive and paid for by a business partner dinner here a few years ago, this time I opted for a much more reasonable (by Vegas standards) lunch with my wife. She couldn't have been happier with the view of the Bellagio fountains, and I couldn't have been happier with my lunch of foie gras with duck prosciutto and butternut squash soup.
