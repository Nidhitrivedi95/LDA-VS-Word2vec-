O66Zy8Y13VBm72ZDhS4fIg I've had what was probably my best steak here, and each time I've come in here my dining experiences have been superb from the service to the value for money when you consider this is sort of a big time Yorkville establishment. You will definitely be spending quite a bit here unless you come in here for a "licious" meal which I've done as well. You get live music in the form of a cello or some similar elegant set up providing a very nice ambiance. 

They change their menu often from my experience so I won't get in to specific details about my dishes, but they all deliver for me in terms of platting and quality, as for drinks I highly recommend them and you really should not be looking to cheap out on a night out at Sassafraz. 

There are a few good places to visit in Yorkville but Sassafraz should be high up on your list.
