YH8Bn-7pLR-SFR8MCgQj1w Jules Cafe Patisserie is a nice small cafe. Coffee is good, but it is expensive by considering the shop and the area. Maybe the customers there stay so long in the shop, so the price may be reasonable for Jules Cafe Patisserie. They have salads, pastries, and other baked things. The croissant is good. I do not know why Jules Cafe Patisserie does not show their business hours on their website. I went there around 9:00 and they already opened.
