XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q This is the first 3 Michellin star restaurant I had ever been to and it was truly the epitome of fine dining. When we went we had the tasting and some of the highlights were the  the Le Topinambour (Parmesan flan with sunchoke cream and duck confit), Le Bar (Pan-fried sea bass with a lemon grass foam and stewed baby leeks), and the best dish was the L'Epaule d'Agneau (Braised Lamb shoulder flavored meridional spices with semolina and black truffles). The service was absolutely amazing and we were lucky enough to get a tour of the kitchen and I must say I was completely impressed with the speed and efficiency at which the kitchen worked. What was most amazing was the fact that the line was completely silent. Overal, a great experience......until we got our $1,400 bill. But it's only expected when you go to a restaurant of this caliber.
