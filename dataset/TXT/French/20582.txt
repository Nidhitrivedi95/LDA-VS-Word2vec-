AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw I was staying at Cesars palace for a jewelry convention.I found this place for breakfast the continental breakfast was i think $26.00.
Let me tell you  this place is just amazing the decor is beautiful and so original.There is a big machine that is a clock and it spits out a free choclate every fifteen minutes.
Make sure you eat the appricot turn over and choclate croissant.
