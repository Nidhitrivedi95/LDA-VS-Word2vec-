tAj-0ZPUATzLHS0KHzXFBQ Incredible restaurant!  Everything was just really, really good. My son said the gazpacho was the best soup he's ever had. The other soup was chicken consommé with zucchini and it was just tremendous as well. 

We had the raclette which was both very tasty and entertaining. The meats were great as was the cheese. 

For desert we shared the chocolate dome which gets melted at the table with butterscotch (perhaps the best I've ever had). 

I can't imagine a better restaurant in Montreal!
