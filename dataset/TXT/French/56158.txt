rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I'm a big Thomas Keller fan (love Bouchon Bistro, Ad Hoc etc) but Bouchon Bistro was pretty average. I had high expectations and it didn't fail in any way it was just average. I had the Petite breakfast and it was a good amount of food and hit the spot but it just didn't blow me away versus the run of the mill diner. Next time, maybe.
