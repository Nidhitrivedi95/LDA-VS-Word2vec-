Seafood linguini was good, but not spectacular (granted, why would I choose Italian at a French place?), but the waiter recommended it over the other option I was thinking about (the chicken with goat cheese and spinach... so...). Really, it was a pleasant night sitting on the back patio with good ambiance, but the service was slow and as the definitions for the ratings go, "Meh. I've experienced better."
