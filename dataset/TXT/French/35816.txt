hvjgF-vnPw2jyL5DBuB0qg I'm assuming we visited on an "off-night". It pains me to write this because I was extremely excited to dine at Garde Manger and because I'm a fan of l'émission "Chuck's Day Off."

We were a party of 2 and had reservations at the bar - which was fine with us.

We ordered the lobster poutine and tomato/avocado salad for appetizers. The salad was good - had fried mozzarella - good stuff. Selon nous autres vous pouvez trouver une meilleur poutine ailleurs pour moitié le prix... Ughhhh. Again - painful to write.

For main courses, we had the shrimp risotto and Duck breast with foie gras/chorizo. I had the risotto. Mon chum a eu l'autre. His was great - loved it actually. My first risotto was 80% peas, 20% rice - literally. We had to send it back. (I will add a photo of it to prove I'm not trolling here). My second risotto arrived, and had a great rice quantity but .... sandy/gritty spinach.

Our female server at Garde Manger was great. She was attentive and gracious and made us some great gin n tonics, which were unfortunately, for me, the highlight of the night.

Here's hoping it was an "off-night."
