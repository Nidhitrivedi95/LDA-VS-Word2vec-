P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ No complaints about the food (all delicious and plenty of it).  However the french waiters were arrogant & rude, so I left no tip.  When they brought the bread cart I asked, "May I have one of each type?" the waiter frowned at me.  It happened repeatedly whenever I said "Please leave the pot of jus" or "Leave the egg shell" (both still contained sauce, which I wanted to eat).  

Waiters should not be acting as if my requests are stupid, especially when I'm paying $200.
