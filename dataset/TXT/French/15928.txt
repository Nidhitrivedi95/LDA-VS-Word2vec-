Service: I counted maybe 10 patrons at the restaurant and with two servers we waited over ten minutes for a menu and to order. This was just the start of the horrible service. When asking another server while ours was busy we received a rude, condescending response, bashing the other server in the process. When the food arrived our order was wrong and we ordered just two items. Lastly half the tables were still dirty and had half eaten meals still sitting around for the duration of our meal.


Food: Terribly average food. Yes if you're looking for dim sum at the airport it's a nice novelty but it's average dim sum at best and for something to have Susur Lee's name on it I expected much more. The grapes were unwashed and the potatoes underseasoned. I won't say it was overpriced because let's be honest what isn't at an airport, but for $7-9 a plate of dim sum a lot was left to be desired.


Overall, there are many other alternatives I would suggest you try. If you're in a rush to catch a flight don't even think about it. I'm surprised Susur let the quality of an establishment with his name on the line sink this low as this is a chance for international travelers to try his cuisine.
