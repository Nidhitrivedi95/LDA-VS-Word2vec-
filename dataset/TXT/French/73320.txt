xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g Never have I ever tasted such exquisite entrees before. The butternut squash veal was so tender that it melts in your mouth like butter. The view of the Bellagio fountain shows was breathtaking. Service was amazing, as well, as the waiters make you feel comfortable and make sure you have everything you need. Highly recommend this place.
