_cjPEH9wXhKS-HQe_U3M4Q Loved this place.  I love that it's close to a busy part of downtown, but a few blocks from areas with tons of restaurants, so it felt like a secret find.  i was blown away by the ambiance, I've never felt so much like I was in France while being so far from France.  I guess the owners are from France and had a lot of the decor imported, including the long bar, all one piece, made of zinc and nickel.  And I believe the tin ceiling as well.  Service was friendly and food was great.  I got an omelette with goat cheese and mushrooms, and a kir royal for brunch. Very romantic vibe.  There is a nice patio in front.
