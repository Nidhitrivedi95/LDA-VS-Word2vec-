3jKUbhGSjFTv5jZ0wnW0xA We were in Montreal 1 night last month, and chose to dine at Les Deux Gamins because we wanted to be away from the hustle/bustle of Vieux Port and b/c we wanted the kids to try French cuisine.  Based on Yelp reviews, we chose this quaint french bistro.

The ambiance was really charming, and we sat upstairs in the darkened section with a fireplace, wooden ceiling support beams, and remnants of wine case decorations.  The lighting was a bit dark for a "family meal" with kids - but certainly nice for a date or 'adult dinner'...  

We had the duck confit and lamb shank, and both were nice - but the lamb shank was clearly the winner...and the meat just fell right off the bone and was savory & delicious.  French onion soup was exactly the way you want it served: large soaked croutons and lots of cheese, with sweet oniony broth!

Service was attentive, charming, and helpful.  (not sure what all the so-so service comments in other reviews are all about...)  Would definitely recommend, as the restaurant and surrounding neighbor have lots of charm!
