t1mR_Zff6Dqv1TueE2JLEA Had the "Amazigh Vegetables" and it was simply amazing, must say. First when I heard Chickpea stew, I wasn't very thrilled but the waiter suggested it was good. Normally I don't go by what the waiters suggest but this time I decided to. And I don't regret. One of the best meals I have had in a long time. Spices were just right and the stew was as it said - with lots of vegetables. Started off with Mango Marrash, another must have drink. 

It was late in the afternoon so hardly crowded. Dinner starts at 5pm so 3.30pm for late lunch worked out just great. Ended with Mint tea and some delicious desserts. 

Can't wait to come back again
