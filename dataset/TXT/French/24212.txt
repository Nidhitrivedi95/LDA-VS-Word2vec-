cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg I went here twice, and both times had an excellent dining experience!
The last visit was during Thanksgiving holidays, and we had 10:30 pm reservation. It is a bit late for dinner, but this was the only available time. We arrived 15 minutes earlier, for we knew how busy this place is. Despite being early, we still had to wait for extra 30 minutes, and finally got our table at about 10:45 pm. Now, at any other place I would be upset about the delay, but this one is an exception. The place is bustling, and we were fortunate to get a reservation just couple days in advance. Plus, I can imagine how hard it is for the lone hostess to mange this huge and unabated crowd.
Once we got a table, the service was prompt yet not annoying (unlike many places in Boston, for example, where you might feel pressured to ask for the check and leave in the end of the meal). The food was absolutely delicious, with generous portions. I had Happy Pork Chop, and my wife ordered a duck dish (don't quite remember the name, but not Duck in a Can). Both dishes were perfectly executed. 
Since portions are large, and quite heavy in terms of fat and caloric content, we ordered light desert - Poached Pear, which comes with wonderful vanilla ice-cream. 
Additionally, the restaurant now has its own beer - Pied de Cochon, a light brew that goes well with large amounts of fat pork and duck meat. 
Another important aspect is the price - dinner for two with tips will cost you less than $150, which I consider to be an excellent price given the quality of food. 
In summary, excellent restaurant with casual, laid-back atmosphere that allows you to enjoy delicious food without breaking the bank.
