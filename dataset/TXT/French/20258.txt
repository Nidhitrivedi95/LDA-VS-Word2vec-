atNpoWy_XrhT9EUIEP6azg Only been once - had the burger and fries both really good. My mom had the croque monsieur really good too.

Service was very good as well.

Really cool live music on the patio when we were there too made for great atmosphere.

Would definitely recommend this place, only reason it isn't 5 stars is because it's a little pricey - $14 burger + fries but I guess that comes with the territory in old town scottsdale.
