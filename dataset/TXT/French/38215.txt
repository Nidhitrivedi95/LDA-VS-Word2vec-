JezHN-9KKLTMbojq00VP0g Very cute little place. I was visiting family here and was not familiar with the area. I happened to be walking past here and decided to stop in and was pleasantly surprised! Tasty french cuisine at a reasonable price.

The reason for 4 stars is it is a very tight fit. As others have mentioned, any time you move you feel like you have to say excuse me because of such close quarters
