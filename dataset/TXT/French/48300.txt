O66Zy8Y13VBm72ZDhS4fIg I am bored at work today so I decided to write some reviews.

I have been to Sassafraz over a 100 times over the past 10 years.

I've had some crazy moments in that place. Anyways, I don't go anymore. Ever since it burned down last time, I don't find it enjoyable. Primarily, I don't like their food anymore. They had amazing dishes before. Now the menu is not that good. I am glad they do live music again, because before the piano was in the dining room. Nonetheless, I find the bar area not as comfortable as it was before.

Their cocktails are great. I can't complain about that.

I believe Zoran is still the owner. Zoran, if you are reading this, get a new a menu. Otherwise, there are better places to go (i.e. Four Seasons).
