L6RxkP8dneVGelDLUhjCug I keep going back and forth as to whether or not I should give this place 3 stars or 4 stars. As soon as I got in, I got a super warm welcome. Like an uncle I have not seen in a long time and he was very excited to see me. He was very attentive and eager to make sure I eat all the yummy treats!

Their menu has very few items...I was actually expecting them to just be a bakery but they have pho, sandwiches, bun bo hue, etc.

Pho:
It was hot and had a good ratio of noodles to meat. The most inexpensive bowl of pho in town! Not the best but good 3/5

Almond Croissant:
Buttery and flaky without being dry as the desert. It's a simple croissant. 3.5/5

Macarons:
We tried all the flavors they have: Nutella, Mango Passion Fruit, Durian, Yuzu, and Coconut. Ok, I didn't eat the coconut macaron only because I don't like coconut anything. They're cold and taken out of the fridge when you order them. I recommend letting them get to room temp before eating. Otherwise, they have a I-just-came-out-of-the-refrigerator taste and the texture is off. At room temp, the filling is nice and softer, and the macaron shell is crunchier. Funny enough, their Nutella macaron isn't my favorite. But I enjoyed the durian the most. 3.5/5

Pate Chaud:
We tried the pork and the chicken. Flaky pie with generous amounts of tasty filling. The pork has more flavor and more memorable than the chicken. 4/5

Towards the end of the meal, they asked us about what we thought about the food. They were really concerned about feedback. This is rare in Chinatown!
