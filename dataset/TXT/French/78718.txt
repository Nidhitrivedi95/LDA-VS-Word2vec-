ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug It's the charming little eatery that looks like Parisian apartment towers on the outside in the casino area towards the entrance going towards the buffet.  

Gotta wait to be seated off to the side, we just sat and they made us go outside.  If you can, try to sit outside for the ambiance, cause the inside looks like a Denny's, and its harder to sit inside once you see what it looks like outside.

Foods typical fare w/a some french goodies in there.  They used to serve a really great chicken noodle soup w/rotisserie chicken at the Paris, I got it for room service once, I'm assuming it's the same soup throughout the hotel, if it is, it's just typical soup now.

Friends had the au jus dip sandwich which they said was good.  There were also some grave yard specials available too which was nice, better to eat them there than at some two star hotel

service was ok although my friend had to remind the waitress about three times for her milk for her tea
