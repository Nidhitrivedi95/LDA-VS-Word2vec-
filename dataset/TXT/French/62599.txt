SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ Had a great birthday dinner here! Satan finally decided to stop savaging The Valley of the Sun in the ass since it's now fall, and it was only 80 F outside at night - so I sat outside with my wife under the trees. Nice romantic setting. The tables were spaced out nicely so we didn't have to smell any other people or hear the stupid things they were saying, which was good. Got the salmon and it was delicious. Service was really good but I am 99% sure our waiter was on coke. He was sweating profusely and kept fumbling with both his words and physical items. Not that we cared, it added to the fun. Odell IPA on tap and only $4.50! We decided to get creme brulee for dessert, and finished the experience off right with a 16 year Lagavulin, served in the correct snifter glass. $120 with tax and tip for two people. Pretty much every entree was about $30, which I felt was about $10 overpriced - it was great but not $30 outstanding.
