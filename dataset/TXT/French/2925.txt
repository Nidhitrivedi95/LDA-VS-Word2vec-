0Xr0kte9ADAfZ-GBO-wimg My partner and I went here a few years ago when we first started dating. Back then (10 years ago) I remember the food being better then what I had today. 

I ordered the croquettes de Brie. When I had them years ago they were warm, there were 4 pieces and the sauce served with it was a nice accopienment.  This time it was bland only two pieces and was very disappointed.
My partner ordered the escargot, which he said was bland and rubbery.

For the main I ordered their special: seared salmon with dill cream sauce rice and vegetables. Not impressed. I found the salmon salty and their wasn't enough sauce.
My partner ordered the duck which he said was tough and tasteless. The potato what ever that came with it didn't impress him either.

The waitress did ask us how we liked it and we did tell her how we felt.

For dessert I ordered the proiferals with chocolate and ice cream. Not doing that again
My partner had the creme brûlée which he enjoyed.

Overall I left disappointed.
