34kffX28O5H1hif6i0oHOg Went there on Boxing Day for dinner. Wine is nice Very nice environment staff is very friendly . However the food quality is really bad. Foie gras is over cooked. Can't really taste the flavour anymore . Ordered a steak and ask for medium rare they presented medium well ... Very expensive for the food quality you can ask for . Will never visit again.
