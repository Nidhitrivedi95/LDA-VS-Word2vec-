0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g It's 2 am and I'm still hungry.....I should have ordered a bowl of noodles, like my bf did after our dinner at Picasso.

I've been to a couple of two- and three-star Michelin restaurants, and this restaurant doesn't have the "wow" factor that I expected -- so I was kind of disappointed.  First off, service was pretty good, they gave us great seats so we could watch the Bellagio fountain show (definitely make reservations in advance, it pays off.)  But our wine needed some air, and rather than decant, the sommelier just told us to wait 10 minutes before drinking it. That was kind of weird because after we'd pour every glass, we'd stare at it for 10 minutes waiting for the acidity to disappear -- kinda sucked considering it was one of the more expensive bottles of wine.

On to the food.  Our appetizers were great 1) fresh and light maine lobster salad 2) seared scallops with a sauce I licked off the plate 3) seared foie gras (served with rhubarb, which was too crunchy for my taste and I didn't eat.)

The real disappointment was the main course. Here we were, building up to the main course, and we had lamb which was perfectly cooked but had no wow factor to it.  Just well-prepared lamb.  Sauce wasn't amazing, sides were just meh.  Dessert was also just meh too.

As far as Michelin goes, this place is NOT aspiring to be a 3-star Michelin. They don't serve your plates at the same time, they don't bring a champagne cart out, and they served us when one person was in the bathroom. Good service, but no different from other non-rated Michelin restaurants.

Coursese are small!  As stated below, after dinner my bf went to Venetian to have some noodles.  And now I'm sitting here at 2 am hungry.
