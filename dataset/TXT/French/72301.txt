XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q I visited Joel Robuchon - Las Vegas last week. Since this restaurant is first and only 3 star Michelin Guide Winner in Las Vegas, honestly, my expectation was very high. I had a four course menu with a pan-fried sea bass for entree. It was a very good and high class restaurant but I couldn't find anything special. I liked a pan-fried sea bass but again, nothing special. I was impressed by a variety of breads that they offered but nothing WOW to me.... It was a fine dining that I enjoyed very much but I doubt of my future visit to this restaurant. Additionally, now Vegas strip has a lot of newer high class hotels such as Wynn, Encore and Palazzo, I believe that this restaurant should move to the new hotel to appeal their customers.
