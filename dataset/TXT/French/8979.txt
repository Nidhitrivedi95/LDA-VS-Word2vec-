4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Ok I will start this off by saying, the location and coffee is great.  

I ordered three eggs that came with bacon, hash browns and ordered a croissant instead of toast.  I took 2 bites of my not even warm eggs and found a hair in my eggs.  The waitress asked how everything was, and I really never send anything back, but a hair in your food is gross.  I know this happens in the food industry but you would expect the meal to be taken off of your bill-especially when it's just breakfast!  The waitress apologized and was very attentive at filling my coffee while I waited for my meal to come out.  I have to complain about the bacon too, it was overcooked and was not a fan of the hash browns.  

I did not complain about them not taking the meal off my bill because I am on vacation and did not want to bother with arguing the fact that a hair in my food is disgusting, but I definitely will not be returning here!
