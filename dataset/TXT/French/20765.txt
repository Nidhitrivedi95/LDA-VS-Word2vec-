AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw This is a review of the Payard dining room for LUNCH, not breakfast, not dinner, and not the walk-up pastry counter.  (It's interesting that all the 1, 2, and 3 stars reviews are of the pastry counter and the better reviews (at least the one I glanced at) are of the dining room.)

We've eaten lunch at Payard three times over a span of one year.  We've always had great food and excellent service.

The first time at Payard was with a group of five.  Two of us had the Croque Madame (a Croque Monsieur w/ egg).  The others had the charcuterie platter (alas, no longer on the menu): salami, prosciutto/jambon, pate de foie gras, cornichon, several kinds of mustard; chicken pannini; roasted pepper soup with a shrimp salad.  We all had a taste of each.  All dishes were simple yet top-notch in quality and taste.

The second time was just with my SO.  She had the shrimp salad.  I had the soup of the day (potato leek) and the beef panini.  Outstanding again.

The third was on Jan 28, 2010.  Two of us had the prix fixe (as already reported, a fantastic deal at $19): asparagus salad + sea bass, and mushroom tart + couscous w/ roasted chicken and lamb sausages.  Both were amazing, especially the lamb sausages!!!  I had the angus burger.  I ate the whole thing!  :) The desserts included with the prix fixes are good, too.

The service was efficient, friendly (but not overly so), polite (but not obsequious).  The dining room is not huge, so it's not very noisy even when full: great for a relaxing brunch or lunch.
