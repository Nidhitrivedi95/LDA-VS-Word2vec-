QD0gnPAdy7w2vZZG9I41Sw The overall experience was interesting eating in complete darkness - but at this location the food was not really good, and I dealt with some attitude with staff that was unwarranted. Appetizer I had cesar salad with "homemade croutons".. I had one crouton in the salad. I ordered shrimp and pasta with rosée sauce and I am very confident it was not rosée sauce... Mind you I could not see the food - but I have had many rosée dishes in my day and this tasted like tomato sauce. Portions were very small.

The doorman was extremely rude to me which over-shaded the experience. I had a reservation at 8:30pm, waited until 9pm to say something.. I approached the man who was working at the desk, brown short hair, not tall. I asked him very politely about my table and when we would be seated. He said "Do you see all the people here?" I said "Yes, I know you're busy... but I have a reservation and it's now 9pm" He said "you'll be seated soon."  He expected me to walk away, but i stood there a tad confused about how i was being spoken to. "whats your name?" he asked. I said my name, to which he replied "There. You're next, are you happy now?" I was gobsmacked. The waiter laughed it off and then directed us into the dark to our seats before I could ask for the asshole's name.  

Clearly the guy wasn't having a great night - but to work front desk and have that kind of attitude towards a paying customer who has a valid question? Not okay.

My server was excellent, just the food and the front desk service were bad.
