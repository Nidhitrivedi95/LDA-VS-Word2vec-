SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA Would be five stars if it wasn't for the service which definitely didn't represent a 5 star restaurant. 

I will say that the food here is really really amazing. I came with a large group and we had a prefix menu. To start we had a salad and chicken liver pate which was mouth watering. For my entree, I had the duck confit which I just couldn't get enough of. For dessert, the warm chocolate cake served with ice cream. 

Everything about L'Albatros is superb: 

- ambiance 
- food
- outdoor patio ( in spring/ summer)

If you haven't been here before, I highly recommend you do go. It is a must in Cleveland and I would even go so far as to say it stands out amongst many restaurants that I have been to in New York and globally. 

As far as our server, maybe she was having an off night.....it happens.
