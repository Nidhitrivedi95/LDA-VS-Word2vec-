O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q 2 stars for the service (very friendly and attentive) and no stars for the food. I hate to base this all on mac and cheese, but if a place calls a dish "Almost Famous Mac and Cheese," they better live up to the name. In reality, it should have been "Famously Bad Mac and Cheese" - milky pasta with what seemed like no cheese at all. And if you spend the $10 to get the lobster put in, that's almost $20 of lobster flavored milk sauce. No good.
