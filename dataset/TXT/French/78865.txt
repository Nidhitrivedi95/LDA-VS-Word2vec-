ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug Needed to grab breakfast.  There was a long line so we were a bit skeptical as we had to catch a flight.  The lined moved as there were 12 ahead of us.  The food was good - beignet, custom omlette, quiche, crepe.  Servers were usual-got it done.  We made our timing to make our shuttle to our flight home.
