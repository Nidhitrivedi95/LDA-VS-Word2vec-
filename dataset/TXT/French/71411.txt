xcmmTXhuMx2fZF2Bt69F4w While Bob and I were waiting to be seated, I looked around the restaurant at what people were eating.  Pretty much every table had a huge bowl of mussels on it, with a helping of fries nestled alongside.

I wasn't planning to get them, but I buckled after Bob agreed to split.  I am so glad he did, because they were delicious beyond my wildest hopes.  We ordered them in the classic white wine light cream sauce, and I can honestly say I've craved them at least three times in the past two weeks since we went.

We also tried the Mediterranean platter, which was equally delicious and very healthy, and the Carbonnade Flamande, which was basically a very salty pot roast.  For entrees, stick with the mussels.  

Oh, and the fries?  They are out-of-control good.  Bob and I don't eat fries, but we ate every last crumb of these.  They are damned good.
