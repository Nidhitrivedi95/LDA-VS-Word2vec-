4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I guess the French chefs at Mon Ami Gabi don't know how to make turkey! (Nor filet mignon)

We went there for Thanksgiving. They had a prix fixe menu for the occasion that comes with all the standard Thanksgiving items (turkey, yam, stuffing, gravy, etc), as well as the rest of the menu they usually have. My wife ordered the prix fixe, and found the turkey to be so salty that it was uneatable, on top of being over cooked around the edges. The gravy itself was also very salty. The only thing good on the menu was the yam, which ended up being her entire dinner. We were in a rush to catch a show, so we didn't have time to ask the chef to re-make it or bring out something else, although I'm sure for Thanksgiving, the turkey is already made in batches, and probably over-brined, which means they couldn't make it less salty if they wanted to at that point. 

I myself ordered the filet mignon off of their regular menu. The filet itself was just ok, also quite salty, although still eatable. However, it makes you wonder why we're paying these prices if I can grill a better filet at home myself. The sides on the plate around the filet was simply a huge portion of fried shredded curly potatoes, that had no taste, but full of grease. It was all over the plate around the filet, all curly, looking like pubic hair... absolutely not appetizing. 

I have been to many many French restaurants. Some more expensive, some less, so I feel like I have a good idea of what level of food goes with the level of price. For the level of quality at Mon Ami Gabi, I would have to say the food is far from being able to justify the price.
