bRmb81XDG3E2SOHARBLTog Food was decent and atmosphere was great. However, the only thing that this place lacks is their service. 

My friend recently brought in a birthday cake with macarons on top; however, some ended up missing somewhere, presumably someone who works in the kitchen's stomach. They tried using the excuse that it might've been chopped up and scattered on the cake. The thing is though, nobody at the table had even one bit of the "chopped up" macarons.

Macaron thief much?
