KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA We had a wonderful experience at this restaurant which is about 8 miles off the strip. We sat out on the large patio( I think everyone that night sat outside) that overlooks a small lake. There was a gentle breeze, adequate shade and soft music provided a very relaxing evening. It appeared everyone was taking 2-3 hour dinners and just enjoying the atmosphere and food.  When you get there, you walk into a wine store. We had reservations, so the hostess showed us to our table and told us to feel free to go back into the store, peruse the selection and buy our wine for the dinner. I thought the prices and variety were more than acceptable. Maybe they could have had more burgundy. There is also a list by the glass is buying a bottle is too much. 
I enjoyed the special of crab meat dumplings that also included fresh corn, tomatoes and avocados, nice fresh and light. My Duroc Pork Chops were heavier with a more Southern spin to them with accompanied bitter cooked greens and very fine shoestring potatoes. We also had a duck dish that was well executed and cooked correctly to medium rare. The dressing with the duck was very savory and had a homey feel to it. The service was great.
