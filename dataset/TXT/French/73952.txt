xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE!  I dined here for brunch for the first time and it was a true standout experience and one of the best memories I'll keep with me after this weekend. 

FOOD: I am not a huge fan of French Cuisine but this was good.  Great quality food and easy for anyone to eat if they aren't familiar with French food.  

SERVICE:  FANTASTIC. Our server was very respectful and the server assistant was very attentive and respectful to give us our space when we wanted it.  I think she read my lips one time when I said I needed more coffee because before I could turn my head to get someone's attention she came with the coffee and said  "I'm here!" I was so impressed!  From the host stand, to the servers, and back to the host stand, I had the best customer service in Vegas at The Eiffel Tower Restaurant.

AMBIANCE: It was the perfect balance of comfort and class.  I loved the windows and the decor. 

VIEW: INCREDIBLE. I was able to get a panoramic view of the Bellagio water show but also an unobstructed view of the strip.  With the decor and the views that it offers, it is a new MUST-DO destination on EVERY Vegas trip in the future.  

I will be coming to the Eiffel Tower Restaurant every time I visit now and am now open to staying at the hotel.  I haven't had dinner there but I definitely will next time!  I'm a raving fan!
