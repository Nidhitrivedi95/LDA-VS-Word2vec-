Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA First of all.  Location Location Location.  On the south end of the strip in the beautiful mandalay bay THEHotel on the 64th Floor.  

Even before you step foot into this restaurant you have to pass through the MIX bar which has a magnificent view of the entire strip from the 64th floor.  I can't think of a palce with a better view at night even compared to the Eiffel Tower in the Paris Hotel.

FOod was great.  I had teh Colorado Rack of lamb which was delicious.  Not gamey at all.  

DIdn't have wine although wine list was expensive.

Over all decor was very white with hints of red for those of you who have been to the NYC one the decor there is red with hints of white.

Service was a 3 out of 5

Food was a 5

THey treat you pretty well as long as reservations are taken care of ahead of time rather than doing a walk in.  Reservations are a must.  Walk-ins are nearly impossible.
