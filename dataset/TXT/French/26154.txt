d482l58ho0_IMdFkXX1F5Q Sorry to say, I wasn't really impressed. The place certainly is beautiful. I'll give it that. That is the best thing I can say about it. We came here the day before the official grand opening.
We ordered off the pre fixe menu and got the wine pairing as well. I was NOT impressed with the wine. The food was eh. OK. My caesar salad had some carrot, and radishes in it. I'm not opposed to those, but I dont think they belong in that salad. I also didn't care for the anchovies "decorated" on top. Kinda gross IMO.
The steak frites dinner was OK. I REALLY liked the grilled romaine with mustardy dressing. Weird, that I liked that better than the caesar, but whatev. The cheese platter was nice for dessert too.
I just realized writing about the cheese platter what put me off. First, we were a group of 7. When they brought out bread, they had a small bowl with 7 small pieces. I understand that it's a classier place, not cheesecake factory with huge portions but come on! 7 pieces of bread. And, when I ordered my cheese platter for dessert, there was one tiny piece of cranberry bread. I dont know about you, but I LOVE my bread when eating cheese. Hello, if you want to model yourself after a Parisian brasserie, gimme some damn bread fool!
It certainly was an OK meal, but for $100, I'd rather go elsewhere. Yes, a hundred bucks for a small caesar salad, small steak frites and a cheese platter with wine pairing. There are soooooo many places on the strip I can do better for a hundred bucks and TONS of places I can go off the strip, (like 5 times!) for better food and price point. For me, it's a one and done.
