0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g Picasso is one of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas. Why blow $400 gambling and be left with nothing, when you can experience Chef Julian Serrano's cuisine instead?

The ambiance is second to none in Vegas. Requesting a window seat is an absolute must - it gives you an intimate, private view of the Bellagio fountains. Real Picasso artwork, worth millions, watches you from the walls as you eat. Especially notable is the Picasso behind the bar - it's one of the most unique in Vegas.

For dinner, you choose between either the 4-course Degustation menu ($123) or 3-course Prix Fixe menu ($119). Wine pairings are offered for an additional $63 or $55, respectively. 

My advice to you regarding the wine pairings is this - SPEND THE MONEY. Not only will a master sommelier entertain you with the history of each wine before pouring you a glass, but you'll also get to taste wines with extremely limited production runs (ex. only 100 bottles made each year).

The flavor of the wine, when paired with the food simply needs to be experienced to be believed. The best illustration of this was the sauteed "A" streak of foie gras. The peaches in the dish, paired with the muscat grape and cinnamon flavors in the wine, made it the best dish I have ever eaten in my life.

Must-haves include the foie gras, deer, quail salad and the Colorado lamb. While the dishes are not huge, you will not leave Picasso hungry. All-you-can eat bread, complimentary amuse bouche h'oeuvres and a complimentary tower with bite size desserts will be served.

Highly recommended - 5 stars.
