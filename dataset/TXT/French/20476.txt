AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw I made a point to stop here for one reason and one reason only:  French Macarons.

I got the assorted pack of Macarons--Vanilla, Pistaccio, Raspberry, Chocolate, Coffee, Passionfruit.  They are quite pricey compared to my favorite Macaron bakery in Chicago, and since this is "Payard" I was expecting taste bud bliss at first bite. 

The flavors were amazing--the raspberry and passion fruit being my favorite. Every flavor true to it's namesake. But the light crunch of biting into a macaron just wasn't there.  It was like biting into a soft cookie--and I really don't like soft cookies--give me a bit of crunch anyday.  Now these just may be how Payard makes their macarons, but color me a little disappointed.  Plus packaging in a cellophane bag?  Every place I've purchased Macarons uses little boxes--you don't want to crush those little gems up!  

Service is friendly but super slow.
