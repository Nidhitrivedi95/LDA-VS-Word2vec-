UxWH8zRYIBgs6Q2oykvRdw The food was incredible and portioned well to share. We ordered from both the small and large plate to share (sesame fried asparagus, duck poutine, brioche grilled cheese, and drunken tuna) and was too full for dessert BUT they have a separate bakery that does take out so we bought macaroons to go. The macaroons were simply amazing. Or drinks were on the sweeter side but that is a good thing as most drinks nowadays are too stiff and almost undrinkable.  The decor is upscale French but not stuffy - and it's got a modern hipster flair. The table breads were absolutely delicious (my favorite was the one with nuts in them). If the service was faster or if the servers were more attentive I would have given this place 5 stars but we had to ask for water and bread, ask for refills on our water, flag down our server to order, got the wrong dish brought to us and then had to wait the full prep and cook time for our ordered dish. It was almost a three hour meal with lots of waiting in between dishes. I would recommend this place to anyone who has been to Europe and experienced the three hour meals because I don't think most other people could tolerate the long wait. Please do go and try the bakery because it is worth it!
