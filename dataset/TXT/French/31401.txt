gISrxk4A5dfrjDivkC-L-Q I was excited to try Angelina's hot chocolate as I have visited the salon in Paris twice and loved it. 
It is more like sipping chocolate and very filling. Similar to the one at moroc chocolat but twice the amount. 
The owner is very knowledgeable of her products and will help pick the perfect gift!
They have chocolates, baked goods and tea straight from France. Their butter cookies are really as good as it gets in Toronto. 
I thought the waiter and the waitress outfits were very Parisian and cute
