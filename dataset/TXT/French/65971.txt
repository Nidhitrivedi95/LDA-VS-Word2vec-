udFcIcbWbxrO8uLF95WnQg The only reason I'm not giving this a 5* rating is because the waitress was incredibly rude. Like, she hated life and my sister and I didn't stand a chance. She really ruined the whole experience :(
Anyway, the food - CRAYZEEE good!  Salads were great, the stuffed peppers and their stuffed cabbage were out of this world. We got a bunch of sides too (kale, mushrooms) just fantastic. Great atmosphere and really, such exceptional food.
