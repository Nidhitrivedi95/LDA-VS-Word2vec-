4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw My wife and I wandered in here the other day because why wouldn't we? It's right there on the strip and they have steak frites. 'Nuff said.

I was pleasantly surprised that I had one of the best meals of my life there that night. It was probably a combination of the table we were given for no good reason (just at the precipice of the outdoor patio, with a direct view of the Bellagio fountains across the street), the time of day (evening), the service (exemplary) and the food (perfect.)

I had the aforementioned steak frites (fillet) and it was done perfectly. The frites were unique in that they were really thin, sort of like shaved potato. Which means every last one of them was like the crunchy bonus fries you find at the bottom of a fast food bag. Except these were frites of the highest order.

The evening was just so right that I ordered a girl drink, which was also delicious.

Shout out to Krisha (number 133 that night, I believe, and what's with the numbers?), you're tops, babe. Thanks for being part of a wonderful evening.
