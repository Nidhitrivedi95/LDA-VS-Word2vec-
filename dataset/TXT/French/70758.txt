XbG4OgFoaSIxQxVRhTxU2w Incredibly friendly and accommodating service.  We had the tasting menu and enjoyed it.  Very good value.  We really loved the steak filet with truffled gratin potatoes (I'm sure there's a french name for this but I don't know what it is.)  
This is an easy walk from the St.Catherine nightlife and I love the location across from the Molson plant and Radio Canada; it feels edgy but still in the middle of everything. Very comfortable and cool place.  I was a longtime fan of the old Kitchenette, under amazing chef Nick Hodges.  This visit to Montreal I learned that the restaurant changed hands in November 2015, bought by a French couple who run the front and back of the house.  There's a new menu of course, which I have yet to explore.  A few other reviews grumble about the change.  But I can say that it's still the same great ambiance.  And the service is now smooth and warm.  So I still recommend it.  Just make sure you read the new menu on their website to make sure it's for you.  The current yelp description "French, Southern, American" is no longer accurate.
