rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A ohh emmmm geeee....so good!
i came here for brunch with my best friend.  we were greeted with the friendly host and friendly servers, bussers, etc...  service was awesome.  we got the patio seating which is the view of the pool of the venetian, but it was nice out so we had to sit outside.  the food was amazing! we didnt go for the typical brunch but we went for what is BOUCHON! we started with a mixed green salad; nothing spectacular but i'd figure we need some greens before we go for the real deal...dun dun dun... next up 1/2 dozen of hama hama oysters with a delicious acidic mignonette! then salmon rillettes with toasted crostini AND of course the foie gras terrine..... i was so stuffed but beyond satisfied...thank you mr. thomas keller :D simply amazing....... next up french laundry!
