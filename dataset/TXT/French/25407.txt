The view at night is gorgeous and the food is great, made by Alain Ducasse; probably a top 10 chef in the world. Food may seem a bit pricey as the recipe are fairly basic while still very good. You mostly pay to eat on one of the best view of vegas.

Dont forget to step on the balcony to take few pictures....
