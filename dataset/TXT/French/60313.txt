SBnpT6JDbah-5l_52GM5sw My girlfriend and I went for a date night last week here. I would say the atmosphere is nice for a date night which is why we came here. It was a last minute idea and they were very accommodating in getting us a table. The service was great and we enjoyed our waiter. I got the steak with compound butter, which was good but not worth the price point in which I paid for it. Overall, I would say the meal was pleasant and the vibe was nice, but whoever sets the prices of the items is gravely mistaken about what they are offering. I would give it 4 stars if the prices were dropped roughly 20%. 

Fun Fact: It is called Sardines because everyone is packed like Sardines into this restaurant.
