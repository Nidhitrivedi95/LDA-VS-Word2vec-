A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g I was looking for a cake for my husbands birthday. I called and asked what kind of cakes they had that day. The lady mentioned a couple which included a chocolate raspberry cake. It was perfect, exactly what my husband had requested, or so i thought. I went in and found out it was frozen. No one had mentioned that. They did promise it would be ready to eat in 2 hours and that it was made fresh that day. i asked for certainty several times because I did have guests.  Well after 5 hours including one hour in my car in 90 degrees, it was still semi frozen. The cake was beautifully made and may have been good, ill never know.
