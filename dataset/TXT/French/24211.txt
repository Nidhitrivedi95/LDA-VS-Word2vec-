cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg Clap hands for this amazing restaurant! We started with foie gras croquette (3.5 dollars a bite, which is so good. You can feel the melting)
Cochonnailles Platter (9.5 bucks including various meat. As a meat lover, I was so happy to welcome a variety of tasty meat ) I can't express how happy I was when I tried the bucket of shrimps(10 bucks which is fantastic!!!!!!!!!!!!! Sweet and fresh My favorite here) Oh you can't miss the  PDC Melting pot (20.5 dollars full of meat and buttery mashed potatoes. So good but a little bit heavy for me. The portion is so big) Fries with duck fat is held in a sundae cup. A wonderful meal but don't forget to make a reservation!!!!!
