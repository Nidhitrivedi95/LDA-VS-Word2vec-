uP3H5bcsiTXM0k0xQhRndg Arrived in Old Montreal and checked Yelp for a place to eat lunch.  The 5 star reviews of Robin Square are right on target.  Family run by sisters.  Mom bakes the bread at 4 in the morning! This is true Canadian farm to table, comfort food type of place. Quirky and quaint. The Mac and Cheeze with glazed ham was decadent and the Grilled Cheese on homemade sourdough was a delight.  Salad dressed perfectly.  Service was friendly and warm. Felt like you were guests at their home.
