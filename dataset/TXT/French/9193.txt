4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Outstanding restaurant!! Great views of the Bellagio fountains and climate control was flawless. FOOD- Filet Mignon was perfect. Just absolutely enjoyed our dishes and wine. Tried some great soup. Overall, I will come back to this restaurant and dine with my wife. Kudos to Mon Ami Gabi!
