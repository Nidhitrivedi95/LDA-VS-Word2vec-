JezHN-9KKLTMbojq00VP0g One of my favorite spots in Cleveland- it really does feel like a whole in the whole Parisian bistro. I've been here for brunch, lunch and dinner and all are marvelous. The Niçoise salad is incredible and their crepes are some of the best I've ever had. Call ahead to snag a table if you can, it's a tiny restaurant!
