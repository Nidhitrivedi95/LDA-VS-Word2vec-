We got out of our place late, so we already knew our dining options were limited. We passed other restaurants, but weren't feeling their menus. When we came upon Salle Manger, both me and my sister wanted to eat here. Out of all the food we've had in Montreal thus far, the food here at salle Manger definitely ranks at the top. She had the foie gras stuffed game hen, and I had the roasted rabbit leg with stuffed squash ravioli. I was expecting the ravioli to be stuffed with butternut, but the acorn squash was a revelation. The simple sauce was the right amount of acid, and smooth. The rabbit juicy and tender and perfectly cooked. I enjoyed it immensely.
Apparently the game hen was excellent as well.
We asked the waitress to reccomend a dessert, which she reccommended the chocolate tarte (with a layer of caramel and a dollop of Orange marmalade on top). This dessert was outstanding! The chocolate smooth and creamy. The tart shell thin, but supportive. The dark caramel was the perfect accompaniment and the Orange marmalade...well...if you're expecting something sweet, this was not. The Orange was soft, with just the right amount of citrus, and very slightly sweet.

All in all, we will be making another stop here before we fly out.
