4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Mon Ami Gabi is my new favorite breakfast place. When I noticed the waiters in bow ties and vests, I expected the prices might be over the top, but everything was very reasonable. Omelette were $13-15, definitely worth every penny - they were true omelette rather than the cakey egg patties you get at a lot of places. The service was excellent (my coffee and water were never empty) as well, but what truly sets this place apart is the ambience. Situated on street level of the strip, with a view of Bellagio, Cosmo, and Caesars. Still, I didn't feel overwhelmed by strip nonsense even sitting outside. Will definitely return.
