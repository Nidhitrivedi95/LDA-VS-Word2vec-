LjOBNcNNpuewBqSPxYYTJQ I really enjoy this location.  The décor is very nice and it is a fairly large space.  I like the outdoor, covered patio as well.  They serve wine and beer here, which they do not at the original location.  I have noticed that it is not as crowded here as the original spot, and the wait time is less.  I really don't care for most of the desserts at Amelie's period.  I think they are hard and lacking taste.  However, I do enjoy the seasonal drinks and sandwiches.  Lunch here is a good idea always.  The soups are always good as well.
