LjOBNcNNpuewBqSPxYYTJQ Amelie's came highly recommended to me by two friends for one item, their Chocolate Salted Caramel Brownie, and after missing my opportunity to stop in on my first visit to Charlotte I knew that I had to set aside some time for my second trip to town. Luckily the stars aligned and I was able to stop on my most recent trip. I arrived shortly before noon and casually browsed the pastries and immediately selected one Chocolate Salted Caramel Brownie and a sandwich, the Croque Monsieur.

After paying I was presented with a number and took a seat, however it didn't take long before my sandwich was ready and delivered to my table. Overall the Croque Monsieur was delicious, and the croissant was wonderfully light with a flaky exterior and soft interior, however the ham was just as good. While the sandwich was on the small size it was enough to fill my appetite as I was catching a flight home just two hours later. Next up was the Chocolate Salted Caramel Brownie, I simply cannot say anything more than you have to order this sweet treat, it was so good I considered taking some along with me through TSA, however if they knew what I was carrying I doubt it would have made its way through the checkpoint!

Anyways the food and service here were great and I fully intend on returning next time I am in town.
