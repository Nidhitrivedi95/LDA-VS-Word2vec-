4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw We had a great meal here. 7 o'clock reservations prior to a Cirque show. We were seated right next to the outside seating area-- so we had a good view of the Bellagio fountains even though we were indoors.

I thought the prices were very reasonable for the strip. I had the Frangria (their take on Sangria) which was a deal at only $5 per glass. My husband and I split the butter lettuce and arugula salad which was very good. The waiter also brought us a delicious baguette and butter, and an amuse bouche of carrot salad which was excellent.

I had the steak frites roquefort and my husband had the chicken. Both dishes were really really good. Portions are very generous as well. My friend and her husband ordered the duck confit prior to dinner and were very impressed.

We had an amazing waiter-- super charming and very attentive. 

I have only positive things to say about Mon Ami Gabi, and we will definitely be back if we ever make it back to Vegas.
