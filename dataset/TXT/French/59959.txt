sARavfidmIS878q5BtlyVQ I give this place 4 stars for the culinary experience. I was really excited when I heard about  this "secret" restaurant that is tucked inside of Jaleo's at the Cosmopolitan and I said I had to check this placed out and what better time than for an Anniversary.

When I received my golden ticket, I really felt like Charlie from the chocolate factory. LOL I felt so special. hahah

Upon arrival we sat near the bar as the chefs prepared for the evening and we had the chance to order our drinks. By the time we were walked back to this "secret" location ( which was just a closed off room next to the bar) we sat in a semi circle with a total of 6 other guests. 
We had a total of 19 tastings of which I was only WOWed with 6 or 7. We were told that we were going to go into the mind of Jose Andres who is I guess is very bazaare. We took a journey to different parts of Spain with this experience which was interesting. This was suppose to be a "show" but yet the entertainment was not very lively. I just don't know how to explain it. I guess I was expecting a little more excitement and enthusiasm. 
Overall, if I'm going to pay $700 for a meal for 2 I don't think it is too much to ask for some excitement from the staff right??

Here is what we had:

Edible Sangria 2014
Cotton Candy 2.0
Daisy
Beet-Kini
Coca De Recapte
"Merienda"
Oyster & Oyster
Pescado en "Adobo"
El Vermut
Cava Sangria

Fabes con Jamon
Bacalao Al Pil Pil
Mar Y Montana
Morels En Papillote
Chuleta

La Serena with Contton Candy
Crema Catalana Egg
Pan Con Chocolate
Perrero Rocher
Yemita

The good thing is that it got progressively better but it took up to about the 9th tasting. You should try this place just to have the experience but if you have had GOOD food from Spain, its hard to compare.  The unique presentation and overall experience is worth the try. Oh by the way, the menu does changes every few months.

Good Luck and Good Eats!
