SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA I lived in Cleveland for three years while I was in law school, and now having lived in LA for a few months, this is the one place I truly miss. This restaurant is absolutely not to be missed. Almost every important occasion over those three years for me happened here, and I can assure you that those memories will stay with me and my family for a lifetime. The food is excellent, but that's not what makes this place a must-visit. The beautiful patio, friendly staff, and mood-setting atmosphere are all just perfect. I had intimate anniversary dinners here, a large graduation party, and important meetings with professors and fellow students. If you are wondering where to go tonight - or any other night - in Cleveland, this is the place.

I should have written this review years ago. Kim, the manager here, is the gold standard. Don't waste another second reading reviews or deciding where to go. Head to L'Albatros and enjoy this Cleveland gem.
