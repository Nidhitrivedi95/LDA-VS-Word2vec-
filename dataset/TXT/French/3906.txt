2B46bRpDh49eDyjXGhL_ZQ I got a chance to meet Maggie. She is a wonderful lady that move from south of France to Las Vegas. It took her 20+ months to open since she isn't a citizen. I am glad this place is located close to my house. I would definitely come here more often and highly recommend everyone that loves crêpes to stop by. It's great portion and inexpensive. I would like to add that it's authenticity makes it seems as if she opened a cafe from France and directly imported it straight here.
