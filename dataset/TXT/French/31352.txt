gh6__q2WXFuyN8gt6VAnWw We were expecting all to be good....BUT, we had the worst service ever... the entire night. Our waitress was HORRIBLE!!....over 35 minutes to get a glass of wine. Only one red wine selection. NO Cabernet. The food took another 40 minutes...!!  I ordered the Rib Eye with Mussels, steak medium, it came out well. The Mussels were not fresh, very fishy....actually GROSS and had the sickest flour pasty, bland, white sauce on the Mussels, with more horrible sauce was all over my Rib Eye steak...Imagine white flour cream sauce on top of my steak!!! ....DISGUSTING. I could not cut the well done steak...!!!  My friend had Paella, a seafood dish with shrimp on rice in a red sauce and they came with the shells on the shrimp!!!  Imagine they never cleaned the shrimp, throwing the shrimp with the shells in the saucy rice and sauce.You have to pick the saucy, greasy shrimp up, to take off the shells...what a MESS!!~~The place, food and service was the worst ever!!!   We will NEVER go near the place again. Do not waste your time or money. The waitress never came to ask if we needed anything else, or if the food was good.....she vanished. The place was not busy. We think the waitress was doing the cooking too. No one there knows what they are doing. The owner took the steak off our bill.....This Place is Sad!!!
