E2vRShw8WVt6zfugz-gwPQ Chatterpauls ambiance, tight knit space and good lighting makes it a great place to go on a date or a group dinner. The service was great and the servers were very knowledgable on the food and wine. The reason for my 3 stars was that my food tasted good however there was a lack of pasta, two pieces of tortillinis to be exact. I ordered the rainbow trout that was cooked well however could have been more seasoned. I tried my friends dishes and they weren't bad. I was told there are other dishes on the menu that are great. If they are great then I will try to see if I could raise the rating at Chattetpauls with a 4 star.
