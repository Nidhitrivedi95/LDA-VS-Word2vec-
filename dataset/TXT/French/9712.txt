4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw ok you redeemed yourself.

watching the bellagio fountain show at night, at this outdoor poopy french "bistro" at the Paris,  makes inhaling the sucky faux french food almost worth it...wish it was a thai restaurant, though. seriously...french food sucks. people with no tastebuds eat here, with glee...tee hee... bland bland bland... peuuuu...pepe le peuuu bland...oooh la la...oh look it's escargot dear..... isn't that like a snail? so what if it's uncooked and still crawling around on the plate...if it's ok with the french it must be refined...let's inhale a snail...& the pinot gris...whatever we can't pronounce...mmmmmm it's so rubbery and delish!

note: wowwww, my diet soda was like dope dude
