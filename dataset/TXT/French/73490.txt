Having just had the foie at Robouchon the night before,  the contrast could not have been more stark... 

The service,  staff,  and view of the belagio fountains are all great.  But I would recommend getting a dessert and wine and nothing else.  

 Chicken- smashed and breaded/ horrendously soaked in frying oil and yet... Almost flavorless outside of some aged parm. I could barely choke it down.  

Surf and turf burger -  how you mess this up is beyond me.  The crab was tolerable,  but the Hollandaise was bland,  as was the burger.  

A general theme here was under-seasoning and extremely bland flavor profiles.  

With so many great restaurants in vegas like guy savoy  or Robouchon,  or Picasso.... Stay away from this place unless it's for a drink and a view.
