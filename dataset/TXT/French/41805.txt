KNBHGY4rQVuoHxZf_6ANuw I stayed here in late April 2013 for a conference at the Palais de congress which was perfect since it was right across the street. Check- in was straight forward and the staff was friendly to a non-French speaking guest. I came a few days early to take in the city and it was a good location. It was between two Metro stops and close to the Old Port. The concierge was fantastic and had good tips for places to dine as well as shop. They also made reservations for you for places that were more difficult to get in to. I would stay here again.
