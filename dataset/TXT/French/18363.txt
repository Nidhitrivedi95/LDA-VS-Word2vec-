A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g Came in here for the first time today! Had the French onion soup and wanted to lick the bowl! Had the croque monsuer as well, it was good but i will try a different sandwich next time.

I couldn't leave without the macaroons, I tried the salted carmel and coffee. Both were good. Can't wait for the boyfriend to get back from his deployment so I can take him here!
