4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw This is our go to restaurant on our last day in Vegas generally. Can you believe they make their own corned beef hash?
The Bloody Marys not only taste good, but they are very picturesque. I actually took some photos of it.
The service is always outstanding. This restaurant definitely goes out of its way to keep the customers happy.
