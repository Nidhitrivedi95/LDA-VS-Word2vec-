fNCyfJOfd2R42hkhz2tALQ We had the time of our lives here. Granted, we were on vacation, so this review is through the rose-colored glasses of having nothing to do but whatever we want. 

First and foremost: this place is bring your own wine. This is not uncommon in Montreal, but that doesn't make it less awesome. No corking fee and they brought over a bucket of ice right away because we brought a white. 

It's a little pricey here, but so are many of the restaurants in this area of Montreal, and this was a great place to get classic steak-frites! The service was top-notch, polite and friendly but not at all overbearing, just there when you need them. 

The steak was really nice and flavorful and the frites were thin and crispy and they brought us more when we ran out! Quelle service! We also split a MASSIVE side of asparagus... maybe it's just that they were in season but they gave us a TON, and it was the best. 

But the cherry on top was the Profiteroles. We thought we were ordering the $4 tapas plate of them but turns out we ordered the full dessert. Normally I might be sad that I suddenly had to pay twice as much but these babies were so worth it. Generous hot rivers of chocolate sauce, puffy crisp pastry, cold vanilla ice cream... they were the height of desserty fantasy. Seriously, best I've ever had. Ever. Get them. Must. 

Would go back in a heartbeat!
