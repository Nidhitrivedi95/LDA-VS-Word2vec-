TeUlBlNYodKBtcL-zc-4pA Unfortunately, this restaurant is closing down at the end of the month. However, I had such a great experience here yesterday, I just had to yelp about it.

A lovely spot tucked away on a residential street. Great service - we had to wait a long time for our table, but the servers were very attentive, serving us wine and a free tapas plate while we were waiting outside. They even brought us some pashminas in case we got cold!

I was there for Tapas Tuesday and I thought this was a terrific deal - all dishes are $10, bottles of wine $25, and cheese plates $5. 4 of us girls split 4 dishes and a cheese plate with a bottle of wine. The bill? $20 each, all in (total $68 + tip) . Of course, it helped that we didn't have to pay for a complimentary dessert dish (also because we were waiting so long) and fish cakes (dish at the beginning), the amuse bouche and yummy bread.

Highlights were fish cakes, beef carpaccio and duck breast. But I enjoyed everything else as well. I also really enjoyed the amuse bouche, though i had no idea what it was.

It was so good I think I'm going to go back next Tuesday for their last tapas tuesday! They also have a very reasonably 5-course tasting menu for $40, which i may try next week.

The restaurant owners will be opening a new restaurant with a different concept soon so I'm looking forward to that!
