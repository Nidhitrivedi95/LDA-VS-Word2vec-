rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Went here for breakfast with my family and both the food and service was excellent! Our waitress was very attentive and the second our waters were low someone was there filling them up! Food was fabulous! We got the beignets du jour which was basically the highlight for me. Sooo sooo good! And the berry and chocolate sauce that came with them was to die for. My boyfriend has been here before so he ordered his usual favorite Petit Dejeuner Americaine, while my mother and I split the Gaufres au Levain and Omlette du Jour. we also ordered bloody Mary's which were great and a mimosa with some great champagne! You won't regret eating here!
