0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g OK, I admit it...When I found out this was where my LV Manager's Dinner was going to be, I did a Happy Dance in my office! Yes, a little embarrassing, but I confess it is true! I have been DYING to eat at Picasso since I moved to Las Vegas!! And now my company was picking up the tab!! Shwiiing!!

The food and service did not disappoint! Our server was Robert, and he was fantastic. Talk about not thinking about a single thing except enjoying your company, and the food, of course. Seamlessly the courses flowed to the table!

EVERY SINGLE course was incredible! Every bite a treat. I am not going to go on and on with the menu, because it changes and is printed to what is being served, or in season. There were 3 menus to choose from, each one was approximately 4-5 courses. Each choice allowed a slight variance, but basically you are there for  4-5 course dinner. And I hope that did not sound like a complaint? It was not, It was perfect!

I now understand why this is considered one of the best restaurants in Las Vegas, and honor that it completely deserves. 

I feel lucky to have had this dining experience, and will definitely consider it again for an occasion, or to bring someone I want to treat to something really special!
