UnouNrNq82DHYs5e8nGJNA Just got home from a totally delicious dinner at Le Notre Bistro! Small cozy restaurant with a very tasty menu, beautiful presentation and good wines to choose from.  I indulged in the arugula salad, a daily soup made of sunchoke, parmesan, onion and a touch of cream, and the boullabaisse.  While the entire meal was delicious, the boullabaisse was simply superb.  All of the seafoods were respectively cooked to perfection - the whole of the dish was spectacular.  I highly recommend asking for extra baguette (which is also divine) to soak up the saffron infused fish broth.  Additionally! My daughter who I dined with follows a vegan diet, which can make ordering restaurant food often tricky.  Nonetheless the chef cooked an array of wonderful vegetable dishes, off the menu, that looked absolutely incredible.  

It was a wonderful experience, I will recommend this restaurant to any and all of my acquaintances!
