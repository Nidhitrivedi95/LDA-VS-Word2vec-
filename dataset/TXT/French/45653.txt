mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q I was really looking forward to our dinner here and it did not disappoint. The restaurant is pretty small. Most of the seats are along a counter overlooking the kitchen. This allowed us to watch all of the dishes being prepared. I was in awe at how calm the staff was. They worked really well together getting every dish out. The attention to detail was not lost on us. It was the first time my husband had seen an open kitchen at work. He was won over too. 

We got to meet the chef and tell him how much we appreciated his food and presentation. It's such a great service to come and meet the patrons. 

We did the seasonal tasting menu and wine paired it. I was impressed that they had a vegetarian tasting menu option too. 

We really enjoyed every dish and definitely did not leave hungry. The portions may look small, but the food was satisfying and filling. 

It was such a great dining experience from the food to the service.
