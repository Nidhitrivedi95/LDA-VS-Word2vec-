_T7f2wUgNlJqxsR-cR89SQ By far, the best filet mignon I've ever had. It is truly in a league of its own. I made my girlfriend try a bite and she instantly regretted ordering the pasta (don't get the pasta btw) I can't stop promoting this restaurant. I also highly recommend the homemade coconut cream pie. A perfect ending to a perfect meal
