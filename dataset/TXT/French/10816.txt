4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I actually liked this place. We ate at Ah Sin the night before and I was really skeptical about the restaurants in Paris.

I had the escargot which was okay. Not the best I've ever had. I ordered the filet au poivre, but I should have ordered the New York instead. Their filet cut is seriously the tiniest I've ever seen served. I wish they would have put more peppercorns on the steak. My fiance got the New York and it was very good.
