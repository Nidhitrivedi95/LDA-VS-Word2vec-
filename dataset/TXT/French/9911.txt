After an underwhelming  trip to a different French restaurant in Vegas about a month ago, I was psyched to get another chance to get my steak + frites fix and Mon Ami Gabi didn't disappoint.

French onion soup - beyond delicious. Bone-in rib eye with Bearnaise - now THAT is what steak should taste like. It came out more medium rare than medium, which is fine by me. Perfectly seasoned and wonderfully flavorful. The sauce was rich and delicious as well.

For sides we went with the garlic spinach, which was honestly just kind of "m'eh", but the pureed cauliflower was awesome.  

No room for dessert, though I'm sure it would have been great. 

Definitely a place to hit up in Vegas - Mon Ami Gabi has great ambiance, service and really reasonable (by Vegas standards) prices. Winner.
