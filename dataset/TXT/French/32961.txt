H4N3wGaSJsy8hrNDtADmug I've only been to the place twice in 2 years but I find that the food tastes better after a bar trip. The place is small so you would have to tuck your elbows while trying to maneuver your way into your poutine.  

I make it a point to check out a food place's washroom as it is my benchmark on quality control.  A dirt spot on one of its walls has never been touched since last year, so unless it's "organic" paint, then somebody has selective blindness.
