The waiter made a delicious wine suggestion, based on our wine preference and I'm oh so glad we listened to him. Each employee we spoke to was very knowledgeable about the menu and their wine selection, which is very impressive to me. Our dessert was ordered ahead of time because the waiter informed us that it takes 20-25 minutes to prepare. There was an issue in the kitchen, which caused our dessert to be late. They did not charge us for the dessert AND they brought an additional dessert since we were celebrating a birthday. They also came by with a sample serving tray of desserts, and allowed us to try any of the treats we wanted. From the beginning of our adventure, when the waiter placed our napkins in our laps, until the end, when the staff brought our check in a timely manner, we were in awe. The concern with detail was noticed and appreciated. This dining experience was one for the books. The creamed spinach was amazing, as well as the lobster. It's a hefty price tag, but you get what you pay for and it's worth every penny.
