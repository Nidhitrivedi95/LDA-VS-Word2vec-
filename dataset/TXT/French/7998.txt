4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Way better than spending an hour and a half at the blackjack table! Spend your money here.

Definitely get a reservation. We had a reservation and still waited 20 minutes in line to get to the hostess to tell her we were there (It was Saturday night on the strip). This is a place to plan for and look forward to.

The food was amazing. Steaks are the way to go and yes the fries are as good as the reviews. We also went high society and ordered the escargot... mmmmmm.

What a treat. Great for a date night or with friends. If your gonna bring the kids they'll be happy with the french fries but maybe not a potential wait.
