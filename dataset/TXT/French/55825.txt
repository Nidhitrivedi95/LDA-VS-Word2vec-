rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A So I had Breakfast here, and sometimes in Vegas, besides the buffets, a great breakfast is a hard thing to come by. This Breakfast was spectacular. My boyfriend and I both had the Donuts with Chocolate sauce, naughty and delicious! And then we had the Corned Beef Hash, homemade and delicious! I would suggest this place to anyone, ideal location on the strip!
