rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A The entrees were amazing, Gnocchi was ridiculously rich and pan fried, steak was delcious. Scallop appetizer was very fresh but the citrus poaching lacked flavor. Food is close to 5 stars but the service... I'm going to be snobilicioius here and say that the hostess nor waitress could pronouce my fairly common french last name correctly and the waitress could not pronounce the menu items correctly (all in french).
