zqNgwQjj0_XAll-neGikIw As it is right by my work a Coworker and I gave it a shot, she ordered lunch and I ordered just a desert.. We were seated quickly, our orders was taken quickly and our food arrived to us quickly. My Only gripe is that we did have to wait a little long for our check but loved that they used the square system and we signed and were able to tip from the Ipad. Our servers was very sweet I really loved the atmosphere. as we were leaving we were thanked by the chef for stopping in. All and all a very positive experience. I would stop in again
