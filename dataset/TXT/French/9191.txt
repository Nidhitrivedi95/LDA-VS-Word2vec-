4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw If I could give this place no stars in my review, I would. I know that this is cliché and overdone, but it is completely true.  

I made reservations through OpenTable, but when my girlfriend and I arrived 10 minutes early, we found that we had to wait in a long line.  What is the point in making a reservation if one must wait in line?

Initially, we thought this was a mistake, but the 3 "hostesses" in front of the restaurant quickly corrected us by pointing to the "guest with reservations" line.  They couldn't even smile or apologize for the wait,  but rather dismissed us, as if they had no time for our question.

This place is a joke.  The only thing about this "French bistro" is the arrogance displayed by the 3 "hostesses".

Save your precious time and go someplace else.
