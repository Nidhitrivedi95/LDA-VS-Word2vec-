Tefx_N6A6nrsdj4jHHnbYg I dropped in on impulse and by the demand of a rumbling stomach when I had some time to kill before an appointment. I'm sad to realize, only because I'm moving out of Vegas next week, that I hadn't found this place sooner. Honestly I'd never go to another cafe again if I could go here anytime I wanted. The service was fantastic, probably the best I've had in this city and I've been here my entire life. I got the quiche Lorraine and a tea. Definitely in the top 2 breakfasts I've ever had, and absolutely the best quiche I've ever had. I highly recommend this place to everyone if they want amazing food and service with a nice calming ambiance. I've give it 10 stars if I could.
