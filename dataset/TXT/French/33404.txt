hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA I love this cafe! Doesn't matter what day it is.. This place stays busy! When you walk in, the aroma of fresh, French baguettes and croissants fill your nose. I've tried most of their sandwiches but my favorite is the Moroccan. They make soups daily which are always delicious. Whenever they have the roasted vegetable quiche, I have to have it. It is so flavorful and the best part is that their dough is imported from France. I've had plenty of quiches but they have the best quiches in Vegas by far. They serve illy coffee as well which is a plus. The owner Olivier, always spreads good energy to all of his customers. Aside from the amazing food, Olivier really strives to satisfy all of his customers which I feel is one of the main reason this business does so well. Even if I don't go here often, it is enjoyable every single time.
