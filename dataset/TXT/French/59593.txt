I had the rabbit eggs Benny once, amazing. The Lox dish they have is awesome too. Also spaghetti squash eggs Benny. Cool decor, waitresses are super sweet and always remember us, and the chef seems like he cares. He'll come out and ask us how we enjoyed out meal 9 times out of ten. I almost don't wanna encourage ppl to go here just so it can be our secret spot. But they're so nice they deserve all the business they get and deserve more. AND they usually are playing The Band and old school good tunes.
