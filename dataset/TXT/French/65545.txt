U1LB3sRMGTu_h7Sf9QdNoA Very cute place. The galettes (savory crepes) served with very fresh greens on the side) were very good although I would have preferred more vegetables and less cheese in my ratatouille galette. The croissants are really really good as are the financiers. My husband and I thought the blueberry "pie" - which was really a beautiful blueberry, well, shortbread, I guess - suffered by comparison to the croissants. The service is quirky.  The guys seem a bit diffident, even distracted to the point of surly at first, but then turn out to be just a bit harried and really kind and fun. I've eaten here twice on this visit and may do so again. One tip: they have meal times. If you come mid-afternoon you can get beverages and pastries and perhaps quiche but no crepes etc because the kitchen shuts down.
