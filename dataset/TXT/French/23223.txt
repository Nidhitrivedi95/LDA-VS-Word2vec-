C3PVq7UpeHd6nz1_e-AtkA I'm not impressed.  Drink menu is decent but everything here is boldly overpriced.

I ordered a dinner-sized Indian-style "scroll" with spicy curried vegetables that was essentially a bland sop of mushy vegetables (mostly canned chick peas) wrapped in roti.  Throw in a side salad and charge $18 for a most disappointing and mediocre meal.  For all the naan fusion they boast I thought it would come out differently..... and yet most of the food we ordered was nothing special at all.

Nice ambience - the wooden outfit and candle-lit tables will make you freak if you factor in the possible "cute date place!" designations.  I don't really care for Kalendar, food is a first for me!
