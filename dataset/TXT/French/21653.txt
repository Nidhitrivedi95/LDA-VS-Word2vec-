bEVWHtBRYVwqaaNF4mWNYg What bad can be said about this place? It is amazing! The food is to die for, masterfully cooked to perfection.

Robbie (the owner) is hospitable and takes care of everything. We ordered the lamb appetizers and couldn't believe how succulent and tasty they were.

Ambiance, atmosphere, and good food makes for a perfect night. I highly recommend this place as it is one of my favorite gems to visit when I am in Toronto!

I reccomend:

French Onion Soup (rated the best in Toronto)

Poutine (rated the best in Toronto)

LAMB CHOPS (you will thank me later)

and Beat Salad (yummy)


Overall, Coquine is a classy joint with superb food, the service is outstanding and I cannot wait to go again.
