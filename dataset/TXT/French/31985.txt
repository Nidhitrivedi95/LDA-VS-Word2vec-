gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA Best. Dinner. Ever. What an amazing night! My bf made reservations for my birthday. We arrive and they seat us right next to the window overlooking the city and there's a key and note on my side saying happy birthday from Alize and there will be a gift for me to unlock at the end of dinner.
We ordered the marinated seafood appetizer with granny smith apple salad..ill go back just for that salad. Then for entrees I ordered the filet mignon...soooo good.  My bf ordered the lobster with prosciutto wrapped lobster sausage. Everything was PERFECT. For dessert we shared a warm chocolate souffle with a hazelnut sauce and caramelized banana.
Soooo worth it!!
