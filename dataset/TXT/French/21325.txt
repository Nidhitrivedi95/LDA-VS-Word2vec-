B56AYe5GNuavMDtwFsXqzA So disappointing.  I was expecting so much but my salmon was so bland and dry that I didn't finish it.  My friend said her chicken was just on edge of being bad.  Meaning with a slightly off taste. I could make a better salad but my friend said her soup was good.  After dinner we thought we were being kind to move to the bar so our server could seat someone else at her table.  Turns out the bartender didn't take kindly to our sitting there (not busy at the bar) and suggested we should go somewhere else if we weren't going to order more wine.  After a bottle of wine at dinner and spending over $100 I think we should have been okay to sit for 30 minutes.

I won't be back.
