KBSCJcWGk9QNPX9MTSlM3Q I was led into the place because of the French onion soup posted on the outside chalkboard.  It was Friday night and the place was empty, I think I understand why.  I get weak for good French onion soup. Was very disappointing for several reasons. They left the stems (multiple) of the basil in the soup, I almost choked, was lacking in flavor and because I didn't have my glasses on, I didn't notice the price of $13+ dollars after tip and tax. A bit steep for an appetizer.  I will try it again, for three reasons, the owner sincerely seems to care, I want to try the eggs benedicts and the burger, they look good. They proudly claim the beef comes from rowe farms across the street, not the best when it comes to antibiotic free but I guess it is an effort. Keep in mind, the rowe farms across the street did get a "warning" from the health department.  

Ok, first update, I went back and  I tried the eggs benny on a saturday afternoon and again I was the only one in the place. While the food looked ok, it wasnt that great and most likely the reason why the place was empty.

I will give an update when I try the burger.
