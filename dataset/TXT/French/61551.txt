SJo_IjvzdRtCvZVN0cbrRQ Very pleased with the Blue Door/Golden Goose. I went to breakfast with a friend on a weekend during the late morning. There was a line, and we waited for about 20-25 minutes or so. The owner came over part way through to give us an update. He was very friendly, and we appreciated knowing how far up the list we had moved. There is very little room for waiting. Plus, because this place is a bakery, you have a lot of foot traffic in and out, among the people who are waiting for seats. On top of that, this is one of those places that you pay the cashier on the way out after you finish your meal. Lots of people in a small space. In the end, this didn't hurt the experience. 

Our server was exceptionally nice. You could tell he really wanted to do a good job. Very professional but friendly. I got pancakes and eggs and hot tea. The food was very good. The tea is from Angel Falls, which is totally awesome. It's loose-leaf tea, served like they do at AF - -and you get to drink it with pancakes! 

One small problem is that the booths are particularly uncomfortable. 

I look forward to visiting BD/GG again soon, perhaps on a weekday or earlier on a weekend morning.
