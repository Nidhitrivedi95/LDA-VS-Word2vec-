YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g Fun and tasty! We had only an hour for dinner before heading to a concert at Mandalay Bay, and Fleur was a perfect choice. Delicious wine and original, tasty tapas--what could be better? Service was a little spotty and informal, but still friendly. If I find myself back at MB again I will definitely pay another visit to Fleur and further explore their menu.
