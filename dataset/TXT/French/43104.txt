LQ_gYNs5E10IGFE0NOyD7A We came here during Spring Training for dinner and cocktails. Clayton was so nice- he gave us a super table in a view corner. Kevin, our server, was so friendly and helped us pick great drinks and the small plates and entrees that we all shared.  The drinks were sublime...and the ribs were out of this world.
We were also pleased that the bill wasn't outrageous- it's rare to find a restaurant that has great service, drinks and food at reasonable prices. We will definitely visit this gem again.
