I love the burlesque decor and ginormous bottles of champagne-what more could you ask for!  A small, intimate setting with fantastic French music in the background.  Fantastic for conversation.  Drinks were yummy-I am looking forward to returning to Christopher's to try out the food because it smelled delicious!
