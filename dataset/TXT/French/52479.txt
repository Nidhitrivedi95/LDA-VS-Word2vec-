q0n4I-zqiI47xispOqc1lA I am SO glad we found this place! The inside is lovely and the patio is awesome - under a canopy of colorful umbrellas.

My husband and I had the brunch special: 1) fruit or salad, 2) an entree, 3) a crepe, and 4) unlimited coffee or OJ or a latte. The fruit was fresh, dusted with powdered sugar, and served with whipped cream. Our omlettes were giant and served with toasted Tuscan bread and mixed greens with creamy balsamic. The crepes were also giant and paper thin. I got bananas and Nutella - the perfect breakfast dessert. My mocha latter was the best I've had in a really long time. And we got all of that for only $20 per person. 

I absolutely plan on visiting for brunch again!
