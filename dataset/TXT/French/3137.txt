1aj4TG0eFq6NaPBKk6bK7Q I had high hopes for Jacque's and it's great location.  Went for lunch with 4 friends.  The place is clean and tidy with decent new decor and ample seating, better use of space and decor than the last tenant, but held-over floor planning on the entry is confusing.  Here are the challenges that lead to this rating, in order of occurrence.  I hope they can fix them.

1.  They seated us, then waited until we asked to send us back to the front where we were to order our own food at something of a counter, despite lots of wait staff.  Because the 'order yourself' Chipotle-style was not clear, it was aggravating.

2.  There is no French food here.  The entire menu is variations on the American theme.  The categorization of French is a mistake.

3.  Cappuccinos were served in big coffee mugs, basically a weak, too-much-milk latte with a little foam on top.

4.  "Asian Burger" was a dry, unseasoned small piece of lean ground beef that had been brushed with some kind of tempura or soy.  Nothing else asian about it.  

5.  "Salmon Burger" was dry, sparsely seasoned deep fried piece of fish on a bun with some lettuce.

6.  SERVICE:  

When one of our party asked them to fix the far-from-correct cappuccino, she was told "I'll have to charge you for that."  

When we were asked how everything was, we politely began to voice that the salmon sandwiches were not satisfactory (dry), but got hushed by the wait staff who told us "I had it yesterday and it was good."  No offer of any kind to fix anything.

SUGGESTIONS:

Just take the orders at the tables and be done with it.  We ran up to the counter several times, sometimes while the wait staff was also arriving at the table.

Get a barrista

Add some French food

Seasoning, seasoning, seasoning

Train wait staff in customer service and satisfaction

Overall, completely underwhelming to all in our party.  We were disappointed and hope the bugs can be worked out, as we'd love to return if they do.
