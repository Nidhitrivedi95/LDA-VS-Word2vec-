RfsMUrGUJdrpfrU54rmEsQ Everything was so great! My sister picked this restaurant for her birthday dinner and it was above and beyond what I expected. They reserved an area for us next to the live music being played (which he was really talented!) and it was so cute with the couches and pillows! We ordered a meat and cheese board; excellent! The chorizo croquettes is something I have been telling friends to go try! I also ordered the chicken cordon bleu and fries and it was defiantly enough to share! We had such a great time and the owners and family are such great people to my sister we will not forget their kindness :)
