U1LB3sRMGTu_h7Sf9QdNoA More like Le Long Wait Cafe

For 5 people, we waited over 30 mins to get our food after ordering. Okay, it was somewhat busy but bunch fare shouldn't take long whip up. It's mostly eggs and bread anyways.

The food was medicore. I got the eggs Florentine and it lacked any flavour. The blanched spinach was bland and priced at $14, it was expensive for eggs, spinach and English muffins.

The best part was the potatoes. Although it was shriveled and sad looking, they ended up tasting pretty good. It was crispy on the onside and seasoned well.

The decor is cute though and the servers speak french so that gives it a more authentic French cafe vibe but the egg dishes need some work.

With so many brunch options downtown at this price point, I would skip Le Neuf and go somewhere else.
