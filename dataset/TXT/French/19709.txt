The most memorable items are the French macaroons. They are larger and flatter than macaroons from other places. I had to resist myself and only get two, raspberry and pistachio. The raspberry was delicious, but a little on the sweet end. The pistachio was nutty and more true to a real pistachio flavor than most macaroons. 

The apple croissant was flaky on the outside and full of apples and crumbs on the inside. 

Bouchon: These were a lot smaller than I had expected and more like a brownie than a fluffy cake that I expected. The "brownie" was very rich and delicious! 

This is definitely a stop on my next visit to Vegas!
