rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Surprised after reading so many great reviews. Maybe a consistency issue, but we went for breakfast and I was surprised to find the service to be rushed, and the food really disappointing.

I ordered the Eggs Benedict and the hollandaise sauce was runny, and the bread was just a piece of toast. The salad was bland and the two little pickles make no sense to elevate the dish. I would have been better off betting a bagel at the cafe by the casino and saved 80 bucks.
