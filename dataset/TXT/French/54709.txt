This is a pricy option for a late dinner in the Aria area without having to eat at the Aria cafe (slightly less slow) downstairs. However, despite the slow service we received on the Thursday night before EDC, the food and dranks really wow'd us. My fiance started the evening with a drink I've only been able to jot down as the "Blood and Sand Scotch drink". It was orangey and smooth and finished in a few minutes. 

The beef tartare was a delicious starter. The chips that came with it were super yummy and I was a bit sad we didn't ask for more chips. No matter. I had the pork chop for dinner which was smokey and thick and a lot of meat to put in my mouth. The horseradish mashed potatoes that came with my dish was buttery and creamy and soooo good. My fiance had the flat iron steak which also had a smokiness to it and was nice and tender. 

For a not very busy part of the night, it was difficult flagging down a server for water and drank refills, so I think the wait staff could put in a little more effort in being attentive. However, the servers (especially the one who recommended dranks) were very friendly when they were able to stop by. Definitely on the pricy side, so I'm not sure when I'll come back. Maybe when I win the jackpot on the Willy Wonka slot machine.
