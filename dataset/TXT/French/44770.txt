Mqsb3Tzabaq95yQIWTuQtg This lovely little Thai place doesn't seem to be open consistently, but when it is, it makes very nice food. Perfect for a lunch out with workmates, or as the start to an evening out, this place is not expensive and serves up good two-or-three course lunches and dinners. The waitresses are friendly and helpful, although sometimes they seem to struggle a little with English.


 I definitely recommend this place and look forward to my next visit!
