KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA I've been here a few months ago and had the best spot in the restaurant! Such beautiful scenery and ambience. The service was impeccable and timing was perfect. Great selection of wine to choose from. They have a wine store which I loved. They displayed it beautifully and I was so in love with the set up. The dishes were well put together and flavors were memorable. I would definitely recommend this restaurant for any one who wants to go out on a nice date.
