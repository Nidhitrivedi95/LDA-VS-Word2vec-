O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q We came here for breakfast, I had the mushroom crepe and my husband had the turkey hash. While he enjoyed his meal, I thought the crepe was underseasoned and the sauce had a weird texture. The service was slow and uninspired. I might come here again as I thought the ambiance was nice, but definitely not for breakfast.
