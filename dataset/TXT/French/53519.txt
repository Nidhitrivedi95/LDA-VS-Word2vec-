QlSpPzc4Oy05ic-PsoYH4g This is a casual hip place, a bar with a few tables along the side. I've been here three times now, and every dish I've had here has been amazingly, over the top tasty. And almost every single cocktail on their list has been delicious. They sell small plates and international sandwiches, with an emphasis on street food. Their sandwich choices are ethnically  diverse, great experiences.  Last time I was there with my wife and two sons, I ordered the Beef on Weck, a roast top round beef sandwich that was absolutely sublime. One son got the Cuban sandwich, which he loved. I've had it in the past, and it was very authentic. My other son ordered the papas rellenas, which is a Cuban version of mashed potatoes stuffed with ground beef and spices and then deep-fried. He loved it!. We shared the duck fat French fries, and we all loved them. My first time, I had the roast pork sandwich topped with broccoli rabe and provolone, and that might be my favorite! This is a really fun place for casual, inexpensive, but upscale and really interesting food. They have a moderate selection of really well-chosen craft beers on draft. Try this place! I will be here again and again.
