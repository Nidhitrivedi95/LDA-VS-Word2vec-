gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA I've been here twice and the food is great!  The view is fantastic but we are never seated by the window with the view of the strip.  I think that is window is reserved for big ballers, as I often see lots of business people at that end of the restaurant with lots of expensive wine.  I am in my 20's and I just show up on a special occassion either with my sister or my husband; we are seated with the view of the suburbs but being so high up and seeing the twinkling suburb lights is still a lovely experience.  Both times my bill ends up being over $200 but I definitely don't mind splurging here because I feel like royalty dining here.  Alize puts a lot of effort into the presentation of your dish.  All dishes are covered with chrome domes, and several of the staff unveil the domes at the same time.  The waitor is very descriptive when he explains dishes that I have questions on (unknown ingredients), and they are very prompt.  I also want to mention that the bread here is amazing!  The French put a lot of love into their bread, so delish.  The "experience" here is fantastic and right up my alley: relaxing, upscale, nice view (even though I don't get the prime view), and unique tasting meals.  I'll five it 4.5 out of 5 stars, losing half a point just because I want a prime table, maybe next time I'll speak up and ask for it!
