They are a real French bakery, with excellent breads and excellent French desserts. (Fruit tarts to rival the best.) In walking by for the bus, I have even seen people waiting or knocking on the door even before they were open. It might only take a while before they have lines out the door. 

My only complaints: for a bakery, 7:30 is kind of a late opening, and on the weekends, it would be nice to get early breakfast. Also, it would be nice if they had espresso. Pretty small complaints, really.

(PS, you can get the new 93 bus down here from Oakland if you hadn't heard.)
