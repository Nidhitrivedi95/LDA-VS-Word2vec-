rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Stopped in while staying at the Venetian for a quick café and pastry breakfast at the bar. Delicious on all accounts. Service was sharp and friendly. Big room ambiance with surprisingly minimal noise. Just the clinking of cutlery and the mumble of friendly conversation. Wonderful place to start your day in LV.
