HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw Thanks to Outlook mangling the time zone, I ended up arriving early for dinner and took a seat at the bar for happy hour before moving on to a meal. Charcuterie plate was above average, but the shrimp cocktail was outstanding with firm, giant prawns. The bar has embraced the craft cocktails trend, but the bartenders are cool enough to not cross over from hip to hipster d-bag. I highly recommend the happy hour and the cocktails.

Dinner was outstanding, with excellent service. Had I not had so much at happy hour I would have happily finished my steak diane. The wine selection was good enough to satisfy my wine snob colleagues from work.

Dinner came out around $100/person by the time we were through. Compared to a lot of the strip that's pretty good, and this was one of our top meals on this trip.
