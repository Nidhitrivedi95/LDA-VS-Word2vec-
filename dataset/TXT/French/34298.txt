HL6ZzGF7V-KDaU0zziHyEA I love to go there for Brunch. I always take the 3-course brunch because eating dessert is a must.

Their Pain Perdu is a must try, really delicious and the best in Montreal.
The service is perfect. 
Always ask to be seated in the Veranda whether in the summer or the winter, I think it's the best seating you can get there. If you are seated inside it's dark and would be nice for a romantic dinner.

I always book with open-table and ask to be seated in the Veranda!
