xaqW4NkmUCGRRjmLxiFJ6Q The best crepe I've ever had! Stopped here for a quick breakfast before hitting the road. I highly recommend the mamma mia, but I'm sure everything on the menu is delicious! The owner seemed really genuine and looked like he put a lot of thought into the menu. He gave us free samples of the sugar cane juice, it was so good. I think one of the best parts about this place is how fun it is to eat the crepe with their paper crepe holder. You peel down as you go, it's so convenient and ingenious!
