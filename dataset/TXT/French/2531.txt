0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g Wow. Just WOW. I was there for a celebratory dinner in February 2011. I expected a great experience based on the reviews here, but was still impressed. My husband and I had the degustation menu. 

I was first impressed by the fact that they accommodated a party of 10 for whom they had no reservation. The gentleman insisted he came down earlier in the day to make the reservation, but it was not in the books. The staff took care of it quite neatly. 

When we were seated for our 8:00 reservation, I was delighted to be seated at the window, with a perfect view of the fountains.  

Lobster salad - good, not great. I expected more flavor. Very clean.
Pan seared scallops with potato mousseline - phenomenal! 
Foie gras - I finally know it's just not my thing. It was too rich for me. 
Halibut - perfectly done. Perfectly. Asparagus done perfectly as well.
Beggar's Pouch - yummy bread and rice pudding (chocolate!) stuffed in phyllo. 

Then they brought out six bites of desserts. After all that food, we just couldn't touch it. Then, as we left, we were given a nice box of mini cinnamon palmiers. A nice final touch. 

The service was impeccable. No hovering, no haughtiness, never felt uncomfortable. The place was nice, not stuffy. The Picassos on the wall were cool. :)

What truly made this a five star for me was the EXTENSIVE list of single malt scotch. YAY!!!! I had the pleasure of having a 25 year Glenlivet. So good, I had to come home and buy a bottle for myself. Of course, it will only be used for special occasions, and will always remind me of this visit. Will definitely come back again.  :)
