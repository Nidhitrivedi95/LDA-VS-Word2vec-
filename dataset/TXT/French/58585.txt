RfsMUrGUJdrpfrU54rmEsQ Wow, what a good find! My wife and I went there last night. I had the Filet de Poulet à la Moutarde à l'Ancienne. It was to die for!... My wife had the Hachi Parmentier which was also good. Our waitress was very friendly. Great experience overall--especially because French restaurants are usually overpriced and cliché (which is frustrating for a frenchman). Cuisine and Wine Bistro had an authentic feel and a relaxed atmosphere. Will be back!
