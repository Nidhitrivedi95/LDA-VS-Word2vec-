gh6__q2WXFuyN8gt6VAnWw I really wanted to love this place but there were some problems. To start the sangria is watered down and with it being 20 bucks, it is not worth 5 in my opinion.

The snails have a garlicky cheese sauce and were amazing, must try.  

In an attempt to find a cheese I had in Portugal I got their grilled cheese with the peri peri sauce.  It's not bad worth a try.

Sardines, one of the waitresses recommended adding balsamic to these and wow it was great.

The gizzards with a gravy, now these are chicken gizzards and have a beef tasting gravy.  It really didn't do it for me.  Beef and chicken two separate flavors that need to be separate.

The paella well it was soupy and tomato based need I say more.
