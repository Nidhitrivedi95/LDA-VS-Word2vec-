4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Two visits over the past few months, different experiences. First visit I had French onion soup (one of the best I've had), baked goat cheese (delicious, served in dish with warm marinara, garlic bread for dipping), and steamed artichoke (warm, tender leaves, very tasty). The last time I went with goat cheese dish and steamed artichoke. Goat cheese was as good as I remembered, but the artichoke was served right out of the fridge (cold to touch, tough leaves). Waiter apologized and took it off the bill. My recommendation, don't order the artichoke for lunch. They are reheating (If they remember) last night's artichokes.
