mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q It just does not get any better than this.  By all means, ask to sit at the bar so you can watch the artists work. We selected the tasting menu, and did not want it to end.
Scallop carpaccio with lemon vinaigrette, Piquillo pepper with smoked eggplant and tuna belly confit, Langoustine dans sa coque with green curry, Foie gras herb tortellini in ginger bouillon, Sea bass seared in lemongrass with tomato, Free range quail stuffed with foie gras and legendary mashed potato, Hangar steak with shishito pepper, Light lime ganache with strawberry and cherry tomato sorbet (which I personally believe is the key to world peace) and Cherries with chocolate peanut sable on Amarena ice cream. One of the finest dinners I have ever experienced. Six stars
