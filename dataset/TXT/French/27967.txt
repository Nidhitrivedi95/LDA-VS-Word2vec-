dW9cPsvOGwlOpiz3wEBgiQ I have been a loyal customer for years. Going a min of once a month I was so excited when I saw them on restaurant.com. I purchased 6 gift certificates to them right away. Today I had family in from out of town and as I usually do I took them to this place for lunch. In the middle of our meal the server came up to us and said that the owner would no longer accept my certificate. I calmly pointed out to her that it CLERLY states on it that it dose not expire, and she proceeded to go back to the owner. Again we were approached during our meal by the owner himself and very loudly claimed that he wont be accepting it reguardless of what it claimes the expiration is. I was horribly embarassed in front of not only my guests but all surrounding tables. I dont care how good the food is I refuse to put one more dollar in a owners pocket that conducts himself in such a mannor. Oh and not to mention it is illigal to deny a gift certificate purchased to your establishment!!!!
