FUX9h1a37GJn9ge1baiNuw Second time I've been to La Baguette, but first time in Madison. I remember enjoying the place when it was in Minocqua, oh, 7 years ago, and I did this time too.  

I had a chevre and basil quiche which was thin (which I enjoyed, I'm used to thick quiches) and very tasty. Fresh baguette's always good. Fruit tart was ok with a pretty tough crust, but I never really enjoy them as much as I think I will anyway. I ended up spending ~$14 on the quiche, a baguette, fruit tart, and hot chocolate, but you could get a very reasonably priced lunch by getting the quiche (~$4) and a baguette (~$2.50) and foregoing desert. It's an entire baguette, so you if you don't want to bring home bread I'd advise you to share it.

Went back for a prosciutto sandwich the next day. It was a bit light on the prosciutto for my taste since the flavor was overpowered by the veggies on the sandwich. A chocolate brioche was was not as rich or sweet as I would have guessed, but still very tasty. Sandwiches were around $7. I want to try some of their other sandwiches, but that'll have to be after the quiche.

4 stars since I'm left wanting to try more and will definitely be back for the chevre and basil quiche.
