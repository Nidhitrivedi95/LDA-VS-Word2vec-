Forgot how they actually called it, but what I ordered was a Chicken Shawarma Wrap Plate. It came with your choice of rice or fries (I chose fries obviously), coleslaw, some dippables and hummus. I also got an Iced Latte.

The Chicken Shawarma was pretty good. I liked the way they plated it. The whole wrap was grilled, so it was nice and warm. The flavours were good. And the sides were great with the hummus. Was quite a lot of food, but I did my best and ate it all. Iced Latte came out as a blended iced coffee actually and it was okay.

They also have a lot of dessert options so I definitely want to come back to try when I'm less stuffed.
