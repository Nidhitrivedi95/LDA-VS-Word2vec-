4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw By far my wife's favorite restaurant in town.  The French onion soup is out of this world and the skate fish entree is terrific.  Steaks are great and service is top notch.  This place is expensive so we do not get to eat here often but when we do it is always worth the money.
