YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g I would have given this place a four star review, but when making the reservation we were led to believe that my friend would have more options as a vegan than what she was presented with when we arrived. I'm willing to be a little forgiving because of the fact that it was New Years and they'd changed the menu a bit, but I'd probably be reluctant to go if I had someone with dietary restrictions because of this experience.
