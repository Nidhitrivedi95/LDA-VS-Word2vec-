Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA This place is beautiful! My husband and I had a very nice romantic dinner here. We had the bigeye tuna appetizer and it was so light and flavorful( I am not a seafood person and even I enjoyed it!). The bread service was so fresh and served with a delicious home made peanut butter(butter with peanuts mixed in). He ordered the cod and wild mushroom side and I ordered the pepper crusted filet minion with fork crushed potatoes, every bite from all of these dishes was amazing! The service was wonderful and very attentive. After dinner we went to the lounge and enjoyed the beautiful views with delicious and strong drinks. We will be back when we are in town and encourage others to enjoy this place.
