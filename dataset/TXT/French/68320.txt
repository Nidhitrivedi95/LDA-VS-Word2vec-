vg55SAkrEmuHpWfIMtJjBQ so far so good... trendy AND tasty!

I have learned from some more experienced Yelp-ers to always visit a restaurant at least twice before the final Yelp. 

But I just went to legume, a brand new restaurant in Regent Square, and couldn't wait to Yelp about it!

Legume feels like it should be in San Francisco... the unassuming brick front hides a light and bright interior. Tin ceiling, school house lighting, botanical prints, antique mismatched furniture... a great ambiance! I would live inside this place. seriously.

They don't try to get away with just looking pretty (this sadly often happens with new restaurants in pgh). The food was quite good as well. I had a vegetarian stew (perfect portion size, tasty and fresh!) along with the watermelon gazpacho which was spicy and refreshing. 

Don't be fooled by the name either. They have meat dishes too, two types of steak on the menu when I visited. Supposedly the menu changes all the time which is also reassuring. Definitely worth trying, and if you don't like it you can always cross the street to Dee's and get some hotdogs afterwards. ;-]
