0JGMKaKJGVuDus5WcJzvjw Another excellent meal at Liverpool House,seated at a corner table immediately and our drink selections arrive soon after.
We left our dinner selections largely up to our waiter and could not have done better if we tried.
Oysters on the 1/2 shell,Tender Tartar de Cheval and breakfast Foie Gras to start. house celery salad,rare hanger steak,wiener schnitzel with fresh green peas and spaetzle with a gin soaked pineapple dessert to finish.

We simple love the friendly and excellent service,the space and above all, the expertly prepared dishes that Liverpool House consistently offers and as creatures of habit ...we'll be back.
