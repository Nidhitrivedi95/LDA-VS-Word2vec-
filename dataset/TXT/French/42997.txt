LQ_gYNs5E10IGFE0NOyD7A Nice little place. The atmosphere is the best part of this place. The staff is friendly. The patio is nice and cool due to the portable AC units and mists. Inside is a little crowded but nice still. The portions are small. Specially the steak. I order the Hotel Nacional drink and it's overpriced. The glass is about 8 oz? Not worth $12 at all. One of our parties order the pull pork and it was the best value. I recommend this place to come and enjoy the patio but not if you are looking for a full dinner experience. The menu is overall overprice for the small portions, entrees don't come with side dishes, you'll have to pay separately and they are about $6.  I will return but not for dinner. I recommend this place as a social place to meet friends.
