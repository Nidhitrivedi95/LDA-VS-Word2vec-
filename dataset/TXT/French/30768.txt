fyJAqmweGm8VXnpU4CWGNw Haven't come for wine or dinner yet but I stop by for a cappuccino and a pastry every once in a while! All the baked goods I've tried are great and the staff is very nice. Sometimes are a tad slow but always make up for it with great service and sometimes adding in a complimentary treat!
