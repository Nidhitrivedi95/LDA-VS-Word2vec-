xaqW4NkmUCGRRjmLxiFJ6Q Came here on the recommendation of notable Yelper Cherrie T. Although it took a while to come around and actually try this place, she was spot on as usual - this place is great!

As others have mentioned, it's a bit small and cramped, meaning there is a bit of a wait on most nights, and not much space to sit. On a summer day this isn't a problem at all, as one can easily grab their crepe to go and take a short walk around the Shops on Yonge. On a cold winter night however, I found myself hoping that this place expands its size a bit!

Hopefully this happens because the crepes here are amazing. We had already had dinner so we passed on the savory crepes, despite some impressive options available. The sweet crepes also offered a lot of different options - you can can go with their "signature crepes" or build your own. 

I chose to build my own crepe, going with nutella (of course!), graham cracker, blueberries, and icing sugar. I was quite happy with the combination I went with, but may go more adventurous next time. These crepes had a bit of heft to them, as this place did not try to be stingy with their toppings. 

I will definitely be back!
