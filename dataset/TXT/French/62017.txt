SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ This is the 3rd time my fiancée and I have been here and the food is always amazing as well as the atmosphere. The 6oz tenderloin was cooked perfectly for medium and my fiancée's Cornish Hen was juicy. The brownie desert was especially fantastic. Her pecan pie creme brûlée was great. Will continue to keep coming here. Definitely want to try out the winter menu.
