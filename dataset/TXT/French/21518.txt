The host and waiter were very attentive and did a fantastic job explaining menu items and the secret to their unbeatable smoked salmon.  Yes, unbeatable.

Breakfast came with deeply roasted home fries and a sweet, fresh fruit cup... In itself, a delicious offering, but not to be a distraction from the main course.  I ordered their fried egg with smoked salmon over a buckwheat blini that was nothing short of amazing and I mean "amazing" in the way that you pronounce the word with extra syllables and perhaps pepper in a few expletives to increase the magnitude.  My palate was awash with myriad sensations - crunchy, creamy, smoky, rich, bright, all in each perfect bite (definition: a "perfect bite" contains a bit of each element from the dish in one forkful/mouthful/spoonful).  It came under the recommendation of our server and was later explained as a town favorite for the seasonal smoked salmon which is so expertly prepared in-house.

A short walk off the Pie-IX or Joliette Metro stops, this is a true gem for anyone who happens to enjoy food to any degree.  Just wear tight fitting shoes in the event, as was my experience, your socks get blown off.
