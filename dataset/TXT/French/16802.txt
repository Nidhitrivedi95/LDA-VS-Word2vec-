8xCiibfgqy-8xpCWEaguqg I am from New York City, a city that prides itself with having some of the best steak options on the planet. I have the "Meathead" Yelp Badge for checking into so many steakhouses. Yet, I am giving this place five stars. And this steakhouse is in Montreal. Allow me to explain why:

Food: it is extremely difficult to walk away dissatisfied with the food here, especially if you're from New York City. For $90, the two of us had steaks and one of us even had a perfectly cooked lobster tail. The restaurant may have gotten lots of feedback about flavor, because the steaks that came were perfectly marinated in my opinion, and the flavor was a source of great bliss. We did not have room for dessert, despite our mind wanting something sweet, our bodies simply said no. The portions here were quite large for a steakhouse in this French-speaking town.

Service: I thought the French did not really care about service, but this place really wasn't bad. Sure, servers appeared colder than what I'm used to, but this is Montreal, it's cold around here. =).

Decor: the place is a bit too dimly lit for my tastes. I'm 6 feet 2 inches tall and quite wide, but was bumped into by a server who didn't see me, likely because I was wearing dark clothing. 

I really hope to be back. What a treat.
