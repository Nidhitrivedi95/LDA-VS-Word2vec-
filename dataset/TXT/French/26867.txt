Dcj69NZJnbJhK-YHP_nULA Amazing beer selection. Haven't been able to find the sculpin by ballast point since I left New York. Had the modules frites which were predictable but good. Wish there had been more broth to dip my frites in. Their aioli selection was really good with a classic garlic and a malt vinegar. The best part of the entree were the frites: thick, salty and hand cut! This is how I love them. Will return soon with my other half.
