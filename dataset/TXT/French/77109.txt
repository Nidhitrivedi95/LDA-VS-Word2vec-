YUFxSG6idHePsxOmnSHtpQ My son and I had the best service.  Our server was Mark.  My son has severe food allergies and they catered to this.  Mark was so kind, friendly and just overall great.  Food was amazing as well.  The manager spoke with the kitchen to ensure my sons food was prepared without cross contamination.  We will be back and will ask for you Mark!
