rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A 3.5  only because no chicken and waffle and the waitstaff hatin on all of dis!!!!

   This is for breakfest.......

So came in with the PIC  and boy I never been stared down so much in my dining life. Mostly by the patrons but there were these two waiters that killed me. One chick and one dude. They were only 6 feet from our table and she whispered something to him and he turned to look my way and they went back to talkin shit!!!!! Who does that. At least go in the back and talk your shit! Whatever I know him and I very opposite in looks but we ain't new he's my PIC GAWD DAMN IT! And it is what it is! 

 Ok so scale the menu and even look at the specials and I don't see the crack chicken and waffles I kept frakin reading about and seeing in pics!!!!!!! Didn't want to ask about it, I was just damn hungry! So scaled the menu and couldn't figure out if I wanted breakfast or lunch because both sound great!

 Our waitress was nice unlike those losers that tried talking shit on me.  We started off with some champagne cocktails. I think I ordered Strawberry fields and it was deeeeeeeeeelish! I loved that drink and I could drink more but I really don't like drinking when the suns still up!  Onto the food we ordered. I ordered this dish with some bomb toast, potato sphere lookin thing lol eggs and sausage. PIC ordered the french toast and the side of bacon.  Everything looked like basic breakie BUT it was tassssty and fresh. The side of bacon was a BIG side of bacon. Im telling you like 8 pieces of thick cut bacon. I love putting sugar on my bacon and that hit the spot! I had no complaints from this breakfast. Straight to the point brekie, not fancy schmancy. PIC didn't say much about his dish since hes no foodie like me!

I will comeback here but if I see those two shit talking waiters, Im dropping a drink on both of their bobbleheads!
