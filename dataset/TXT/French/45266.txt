mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q We came here for dinner after watching KA. I was thinking about ordering the smaller 3 course meal but I decided to order the 4 course prix fixe meal because I wanted dessert. L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon is a more affordable version of the Joel Robuchon restaurant next door. My 4 course meal here was around $70. 

The bread basket was good. My favorite was this small round bread that tasted like a puff pastry croissant. The amuse bouche had mixed reviews at our table. Some thought it was inedible and it scared me to eat it but I didn't think it was too bad. It is warm pate with a texture like flan and some foam. 

The waiter was really nice and offered some helpful food recommendations. I ordered the Calamari, Broccoli and Bacon Soup, Duck, and Tarts. My sister ordered the Beef Cheek as her main course which was small but really tender. The Calamari and Broccoli and Bacon soup appetizers were interesting and yummy. I really liked the Duck as well. I was pretty stuffed by the third round so I wasn't able to finish my dessert! The dessert came with 5 tarts - chocolate, fruit, cinnamon, lemon, and snickers. All of them were delicious!
