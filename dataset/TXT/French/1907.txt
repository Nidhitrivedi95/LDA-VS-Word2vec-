0JGMKaKJGVuDus5WcJzvjw On my recent trip to Montreal this was one of my MOST awaited meals here. We arrived nice and early at 5PM to our reservation. There were a couple other groups already seated. From the time we were seated it took nearly 20 minutes before ANYONE came to read the specials, give us water, etc. It's as if they completely forgot about us which is bizarre because they were seating additional tables and reading the specials to people all around us. Having been to numerous high end restaurants before I was awe-struck. Finally I had to say something and a waiter came to address us. 

Despite the poor service I was determined to try the food so we ordered a bunch of dishes: the tartare, foie gras, oysters, lobster spaghetti, and chicken confit. The tartar and lobster spaghetti were amazing. The cream sauce was very good with a mix of creaminess and brine from the lobster. Foie gras was good but wasn't too impressed by the relish accompaniment and bun. The confit kind of fell flat. It was an impressive amount of food however I felt like the quality of food was a bit lacking and didn't live up to the hype. The combination of poor service and mid-level food I'm not sure I would recommend this place to others.
