KxUczoGoAwkX9mSHwWlUAw We decided to try The Globe restaurant at the recommendation of our hotel concierge. 
He informed us that the restaurant was 20 years old and was staffed by models. 
As you can imagine, this conjured up ideas of an old dingy restaurant staffed by wanna be (inept) actors, models etc. 
we had previously tried few recommendations made by our hotel concierge with great results, so we ultimately decided to trust him again. 

We were definitely pleasantly surprised. 
Upon arrival, we saw a modern,trendy and sexy restaurant with beautiful people working there. Of course, we were still a bit skeptical of the service.  Again, we were pleasantly surprised. The staff was quite efficient and our server, although not a model, was gorgeous, professional and more than knowledgeable of the menu and wine list. She and the rest of the staff provided all eleven of us with an amazing experience. 

The food was also very good and beautifully plated. My only gripe, which seems to be the norm for all bars and restaurants in Montreal, is that they measure the pour for every drink. I am a vodka ( on the rocks ) drinker and found that every time I ordered a drink, I had to order a double.
