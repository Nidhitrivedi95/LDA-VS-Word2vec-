hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA THIS PLACE IS AMAZING! I am allergic to gluten and diary, and any sort of French restaurants are usually impossible for me to eat at, but not here! They actually cared about me and my allergies and worked with me until they found something I could eat. I ended up ordering a tuna sandwich on a gluten free wrap and a vanilla soy latte. If I lived in LV I would be here every day for brunch if I could, it was that good. It deserves five stars, no question.
