bzbNGyrTwWHAgg1CqkSgeg I frequent this place when I'm out on the weekends and want some breakfast/brunch. It's nice and the food is delicious. Most times I sit at the bar and they've been cool. Service has been great. Today though I couldn't because the competition for a bar seat was stiff. As I am waiting though I notice they were taking parties that came in after me. First 2 parties of two (one that put their name on the list immediately after me), then a party of 4. It wasn't until I said something about it that they decided to look for a table stating they were waiting for a two top to open. What do you mean? 2 parties of two that entered that door after me were just seated at a two and a four top. It would be one thing if they had call ahead seating but Terrace does not. Yeah I get that servers typically don't want to wait on a party of 1 but it's not about them. It's about the customer. Puts a bad taste in my mouth that they didn't feel they need to seat in the order I came in whether I was one or two ppl. I'd get it if I had 3 or more ppl and you needed a larger table but they literally could've sat me anywhere in the restaurant as a single party. Might have to find a new breakfast spot that's on my side of town.
