zw4Legbcu018p5WcZ74iWA I'll always remember this local haunt as where I spotted the actress that played Maybee on Arrested Development. That was many moons ago, but it reminds me how cool this place is. 

I've always enjoyed the $2 mini tofu burgers fried in peanut oil (vegetarian friendly!) and the poutine is solid. The sauces and dressings are good too. Well priced. So simple, so delicious...

Warning: There is hardly any space inside (barely seats 10 ppl if at all) and can fill up quickly.
