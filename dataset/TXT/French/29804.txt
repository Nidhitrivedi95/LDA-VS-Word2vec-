Went here with friends on a Saturday night before a show and we were treated so well. 
The standout for me and always looking for the best of the best in the city was the hand-chopped steak tartare.  One of the best in this city right now.

What I do miss and wish they would bring back on their dessert menu is the "fairy floss". It was such a delightful and unique dessert in a high-end restaurant and I miss it. If you never had a chance to try it....it was maple infused COTTON CANDY!!!
