d482l58ho0_IMdFkXX1F5Q Ecstatic to have Chef Boulud back in Vegas!  I have visited DB on two separate occasions once at the bar and another in the dining room and enjoyed both dining experiences immensely!  The sommelier, Devin Zendel, is a knowledgeable guy and my parents and I enjoyed speaking with him.  Service was very warm and knowledgable.  Will return for sure.
