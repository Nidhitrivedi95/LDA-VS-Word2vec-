zqNgwQjj0_XAll-neGikIw I love quaint little cafés like this one. The ladies at the register were extremely friendly and the chef even came out and greeted all the tables making sure everything was as it should. The food is to never disappoint and the pastries are top notch. Today I got the open faced club sandwich and it was delicious and perfectly paired with a side salad. Can't wait to come back to enjoy more of this little place!
