Hard to give them the proper justice they deserve. Many of these things are food, and while the entire meal at Chez Victoire was one of the best I've ever hard they served a french onion soup the likes of which could only be rivaled by Sense Appeal in Toronto. 

It's hard to describe the pure bliss it was to taste that soup, but if I were to take a simple stab at why the experience was so amazing I would say this, balls. The french onion soup is a ball, a crouton ball with liquid soup on the inside and on the top of said ball is a thin sliver of gruyere. When you bite into it your mouth instantly becomes the french onion soup bowl.    Stunned. 

Also, I had oysters, gin cocktails, and risotto. All amazing. Get there and try it!
