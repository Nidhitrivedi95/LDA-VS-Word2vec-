bRmb81XDG3E2SOHARBLTog My friend booked a winterlicious lunch at this French restaurants for $23. There was 3 courses, Entree, Main Course and Dessert. For the Entree, we have a choice of soup of the day (creamy mushroom), Sweet and Bitter Green, Rabbit & Pistachio Terrine, and Escagot & Fussilli. I took the escagot, which was heavy due to the creamy rose sauce. In addition to the entree, I've ordered an extra French Onion Gratinee Soup for $10, which I wasn't too impress as I've tasted better but at least it kept me warm. For the main course, I've chose the Duck Confit & Cassoulet, which is a bowl with one duck leg. Loved the tenderness of the duck, but not a fan of the cassoulet. I've sampled my friend's Beef Bourguignon which tasted amazing. The other choices for the main course were the Grill Salmon and a Quiche Florentine. As for dessert, I've took the Chocolate Mousse over Creme Brulee and Pecan Tart. The mousse was soft like chocolate fudge. Overall I had a great experience.
