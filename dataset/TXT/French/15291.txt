It was intensely buttery and decadent. My son, 7,  ordered the Butter&sugar crepe- yum. It did not disappoint. My daughter,12, ordered the apple & caramel-again, yummy. The Granny Smith apples were indeed crunchy. I ordered the roasted chicken w pesto, etc.- yum. This was a definite Score! -in our search for awesome savory and sweet crepes. Oh and the have combo deals. You know buy crepe and drink for one set price. We will definitely return.
