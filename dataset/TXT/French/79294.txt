ZgiSgTwHOoxdfi0unI36Mg Not a bad place to eat and drink. We passed this place a few times heading to our hotel and it looked decent from the outside. Menu on their website looked yummy. 

Had the beef and salmon tartar. Salmon tartar was better. Then had the steak with foie gras - excellent! All the drinks I had were good. Hopefully you'll get Anthony the Bartender when you're there - super friendly and can make recommendations on places to go during your trip to Montreal.
