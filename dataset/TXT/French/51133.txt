p2OvNFiFKnRoWSRON4-lcA 4th star is for service!  This place is the friendliest place I have eaten at in Cleveland!      George, the owner I think, was my server and went out of his way to make sure my solo dining experience was memorable. He even let me practice my horrible French with him but I digress...
I started with the tomato tart with goat cheese which was magnifigue and so was the light salad that accompanied it. Why are the French so darn good with turning plain lettuce into something you want to eat ?  My salmon was cooked perfectly, was a huge portion, and topped with a creamy satisfying crab sauce. I also immensely enjoyed my peach clafoutis -so yummy and perfect custard like texture.
With a great outdoor dining patio and a glass of wine, this is a great place to relax after a long day at work.
