rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A My friends and I came here for brunch! My friend came down to put our name on the waiting list, which took about 45 mins and the good thing is that they will text us when our table is ready. This is very convinence! Once they texted us, we came down from our room right away and was seated within 5 mins! The waiter came, greeted and pour us some water (without ice), I love ice water especially in a hot weather. I ordered the steak hash with sunny side up and requested for some ice.

Everything was good! Service was great; our waiter came every often to check on us.

I will definitely come back again for some great French brunch!
