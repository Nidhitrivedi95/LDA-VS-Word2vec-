WDzU-miZGQMADcWp-BZEoA I came here a few months ago and it seems like their popularity has grown (rightfully so). As many have already mentioned, this places serves authentic handmade udon, and it is freaking delicious. The texture is perfect - just the right mix of chewiness. 

I stopped ordering udon from usual sushi restaurants since most of the time it is quite mediocre, and you can easily buy decent quality fresh/frozen udon from any Asian supermarket and make your own, so if you're going to go out and pay good money for udon, please do so.

The $25 dinner udon combo is technically pricey for noodles, but it comes with some tasty apps. Also, don't forget to try the dessert udon (having ignorantly only eaten salty udon, I was skeptical, but this was really good)
