y0cgy0tTh_C8NWCk0WGgjQ This place seems to be hit or miss. I have been a handful of times now. this past visit I ordered a salad I had loved the last time I was in the restaurant only this time it felt like the plate had been put together in too much of a rush. The warm mushroom salad had oily mushrooms an under dressed arugula. 
We had made a reservation for 8:30, arrived 5 minutes early and were told we would be sat in 10 minutes. 10 minutes turned into an hour and 15 minutes! The server and hostess were very sweet and apologetic about the situation but I was disappointed that no manager came by to apologize. 
Asides from the waiting forever fiasco the server was great. While I didn't like my salad this time last time it really was delicious. 
I had a bite of my boyfriends burger and fries it was perfectly cooked and the fries were crispy.
We ordered the maple chilli shrimp and the grille calamari to start- maple shrimp was surprisingly tasty! The sweet tomato sauce with eggplant and buffalo mozzarella was a unique combination. The calamari was nothing special.
Overall- Great atmosphere, sometimes great food, sometimes terribly long waits for tables that you've already reserved...
