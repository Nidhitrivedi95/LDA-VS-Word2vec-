DOmVF9YKOvTkqjcgUwtOgQ decent food although really expensive
wine list is confusing at first but my waitress explained everything for me (I was 16 at the time)
restaurant seemed empty and it was around 7 on a weekend so a bit curious
waitress was hot but that was the highlight of the restaurant lmao
would not recommend since it is expensive for mediocre food that takes a long time
