rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I was excited to try a Thomas Keller establishment so when we had the chance to grab a late table our group of four did.  We had a tiny wait since we got to the restaurant early but it was easy enough to grab a glass of wine at the bar which we eagerly did. 

For dinner, everyone started with french onion soup.  They all enjoyed it.  Don't get me wrong, I love french onion soup and I'd never pass it up in Paris, but hey, I only have room for so much food here and I knew it!  I started with the duck and moved on to the seared foie gras which was darn good.  Others had trout and I think another got the chicken.  I don't remember now because I was only concentrating on my food.  

The bread and butter start was good, but unfortunately I ate a little too much filler bread.  I was pretty stuffed with the small appetizer and foie gras.  

Rounded out our dinner with a bottle of wine and we were pretty happy.  Of course our table finished out the entire meal with beignets and the chocolate brownies with ice cream.  
All in all, a pretty good meal and worth the $$$.  Not the exquisite experience of L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon, but I still enjoyed myself.
