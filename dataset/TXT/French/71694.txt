Xd2ZAxoZpH3ZKzQMs8awIw Tried this fancy place last night and I gotta say, what an experience! 

Being a Michelin 3-star restaurant Internationally, you'll be treated to an incredible experience for the eyes to the nose, from the nose to the mouth. 

They will bring the food on a course basis depending on the how many you've ordered. 

The food are so beautifully place that you don't even want to touch it! It's simply art! 
For the taste, I need to say that I preferred some more than others but overall is very good! My favorite has to be my main course Wagu Beef. 

Ambiance was quite nice, we were sat by the bar where you get to see, from a distance, the chefs preparing the food. 

We had Benoit serving us most of the night with Anne. They both offer great services, every time they bring you a dish they will explain to you what is and the ingredients. Benoit is wine savvy, ask him for advice!! 

The overall experience is, it is a prestigious experience. Joël Robuchon has multiple locations around the world such as Las Vegas, Japan, Hong Kong, Paris, Shanghai, coming soon to NYC and also Montreal since December 2016. So for me, it's a bucket list item. Done and thank you.
