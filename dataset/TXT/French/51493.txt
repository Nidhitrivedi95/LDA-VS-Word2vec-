pKiSzUlBBRNEdTML24piXA My wife and I went at about 5:10 not knowing that they only served dinner after 6. Rather than asking us if we wanted Happy Hour drinks I almost felt like they were trying to get us to leave. They informed us that dinner was not til 6 and gave us a menu of their happy hour appetizers, which didn't look too appealing compared to the dinner entrees we wanted to eat later on. As we left a woman said, "we don't have fire right now." I don't think I know entirely what she meant, but we let them know we would try another time and headed over to Lola's coffee and then ate and Cibo. I liked the look of the place, but it was very unwelcoming...
