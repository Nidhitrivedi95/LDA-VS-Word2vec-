A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g This place is so sweet. I love it. 

I am hardly ever on this side of town, but I was getting some spa services done at Allure Medi Spa, which is in the same shopping center. I noted there was a bakery and made note to go inside after my treatments to see if they had macaroons.

Oh yes, they have delightful macaroons! So many different flavors, and executed perfectly. They also have other desserts and fresh baked breads. Two ladies ahead of me ordered a bagette and they said it was fantastic. 

I was not in the mood to eat, but I am sure the place has some good food based off the quality of the macaroons. Next time I go for my treatments at the spa I am going to make a mental note not to eat and instead eat here! 

Also, the ladies in front of me were taking a long time to decide what they wanted (I didn't mind because I was just having fun looking at the goodies!), but the gentleman who got my macaroons offered to give me a couple on the house because of the wait. Now that is the sign of a great establishment!
