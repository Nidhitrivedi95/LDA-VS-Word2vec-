JezHN-9KKLTMbojq00VP0g After driving all around the Cleveland area looking for a place to eat.  Sunday has about 4 places open and they are all 2 hour waits.  We rolled by the little triangle and saw an open table and jumped in.  This place was great.  If I could, I would have ordered the entire menu.  I am trying to keep my mass under a metric ton so I ordered the cassoulet, known also as French pork and beans.  Served super hot this was a great entree that was super comforting.  My wife had what I would call shit on a shingle if Jaques Pepin cooked it.  It was a bechamel on a ham and gruyere challah sandwich called "croque monsiuer" or Mister Crunch to us who use the Queen's tongue.  It was all awesome.  The boy has a PB&J crepe and for dessert we has a crepe with whipped cream and Nutella.  This place was a cute little bistro and it didn't have a long wait.  I would tell anyone to stop here for a bite.
