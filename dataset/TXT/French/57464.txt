rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Great experience here. We went mid-morning for some breakfast/brunch fare with our school-aged kids. Loved the interior and atmosphere. You walk into a gorgeous, dark-wood accented bistro with an impressive bar, and a beautiful blue floor. Once seated, our busser introduced himself and said he'd be taking care of our drinks. Then the server came over, introduced herself, and helped with menu questions and told us the specials. Our child has a nut allergy, and we had no problems getting a safe meal. Food was delicious and very generously portioned. Large mountains of fries came with our croque madame and tartine. Egg dishes came out with thick slices of toasted brioche, accompanied by a butter and jam plate. All was delicious. 

You can tell they work hard to maintain their level of service. Our water got low a couple of times, and the server noticed and refilled our glasses. I believe the busser was reprimanded out of sight for poor drink service, as he came out rather sheepishly later, and our drinks never got low again during the meal.

Really enjoyable. The daytime atmosphere was wonderful, and we never felt that our kids were unwelcome. We'll definitely return.
