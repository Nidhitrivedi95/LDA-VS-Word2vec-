WOj8nPos3R9IIf0Pyttd8g I love love love Lulu! Every time I've been lucky enough to dine at Lulu, I've left delightfully stuffed.  This place hits my big three: service, food and atmosphere.

The service is always great at Lulu.  You can tell these servers eat the food, they like the food and they genuinely want you to enjoy your dining experience.

The food is always delicious and always is.  The house cut frites are delicious and pair perfectly with well-seasoned filet or rib eye.  My favorite dish at Lulu would have to be 'The Movie Star' aka Fried Calamari.  This delicious is banging from the ground up!  The calamari is seasoned and fried to perfection and the sauce is HEAVENLY. I want to bathe in it. I wanted to dip my steak in it, my fries, my face, anything! That Asian Love sauce is a-mah-zing! All of their house-made aiolis are awesome, too! Do yourself a favor and order one of them with your meal if you get frites. 

Lastly, the atmosphere. This place is adorable, cozy and just plain warm.  Lulu resides in a small and charming house renovated into a restaurant.  The place just feels comfortable. I love the hardwood floors and mustard yellow walls. In the back of the restaurant is a small dim-lit lounge, perfect for an after OR pre-dinner drink.  OR better yet, ask to share your dessert there.  

Overall, I think it's clear that I love this restaurant. I urge you to add Lulu to your bucket list!
