4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw We had dinner here as we watched the Fountains of the Bellagio show.
I had the french onion soup which was fabulous, and we also ordered artesan cheese hors d'oeuvres. We have not gotten around to having a full meal there yet. We will soon visit the Chicago location to try their steaks.
The ambience was warm and comfortable and the waitress was friendly and talkative (which I love). She actually told us about the Chicago location , which i did not know about and that they are part of the Lettuce Entertain You chain that I love many of their restaurants.
This particular location is perfect for travelers who want to eat a great meal and watch the Bellagio show.
