 We had 10 courses that took about three hours to finish. It appears that the chef really wants you to savor every course, and when you do, you really enjoy the complexity of some of the flavors put into a simple, but not so simple, piece of scallop or beef cheek. 

This restaurant is casual compared to Robuchon's other restaurant next door. I'm glad we picked this one and that we chose bar seating. The three of us enjoyed watching the chefs meticulously prepare some of the food as we waited in between courses. 

Our time here was simply wonderful. I have not had better food before eating here, and I am yet to have food that is comparable. Great place for a foodie while in Vegas.
