atNpoWy_XrhT9EUIEP6azg I really had high hopes for this place prior to coming here.  It being in Scottsdale in a really nice location and all...but I wasn't terribly impressed w/their food.  I mean, it was good...but the only thing that stood out was the fresh squeezed OJ.

I was dying for some moules frites and was excited to be getting some here.  The mussels were really tender and the broth light yet full of flavor (I would have drank it all up if they'd given me a straw)...but the fries weren't hot or crispy enough...it felt like it was almost there...but didn't quite make it.  We also had the pate (which was good), the onion tart (which no one cared for that much), the french onion soup (which was okay), medallions of filet mignon w/blue cheese (great flavor & texture combo but on the salty side), and beef burgundy (which tasted a bit like stewed ropes).

I know we also had some desserts...but it must not have been very memorable because I can't think of it (and I'm a dessert person first and foremost).
