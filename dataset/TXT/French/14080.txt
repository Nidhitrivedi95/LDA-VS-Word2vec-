58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw My second best brunch ever! We ordered two full plates and were not disappointed at all. I absolutely loved the poached eggs, done to perfection. Their signature granola with a 10% fat yogurt and honey was to die for! Fresh fruit and good cappuccino to top it all off.

Thank you to a friend who suggested this place! Highly recommended if you're in old Montreal.
