4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I've been here at least five times. The view is one of the best views in Vegas. I've never had a problem getting seated on the patio. The wine menu is great, the KIDS MENU is one of the best I've seen. My daughter has ordered three different kids menu items and they all come on portioned plates with a fruit and vegetable. Super super impressed. Wine menu is solid. Service is always excellent! I've yet to try an entree I'd order again (only reason I can't give this five stars), they are all just "ok". But the view alone keeps me coming back for more.
