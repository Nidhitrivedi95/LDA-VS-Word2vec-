FRuuIDOd21pTJHvEGIt1Gg I came to Holder with a group of 10 for a late lunch one afternoon, per the suggestion of my hotel. 

I ordered the Lobster Ravioli ($24) and my friends ordered the Duck, the Lamb Shepard Pie, the Tilapia, the Fish and Chips, and Steak. I enjoyed the lobster ravioli but it was not the most filling of the meals for its high price tag. My friend however said that the Duck was really good. 

The prices were higher than other restaurants in the area and the waitress blatantly stared over our shoulder as we left the tip on the handheld payment machine. 

Overall, Holder was a decent restaurant for lunch with higher than deserved prices.
