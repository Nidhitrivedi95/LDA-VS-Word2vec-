Da6eZFThE9xanUAGNpZxAg Selected this restaurant for my sister in law's birthday dinner, and a plus was that Winterlicious was on ^_^

We were seated and offered drinks and brought water. The place isn't big, but very cosy and the tables aren't super close together. Would love to sit at the front window table for 4 next time, very nice atmosphere. 

We all selected our courses and meat board. We drooled a bit watching the table next to us devour their meat board and fresh bread with olive oil. Our board came and after waiting another 10 minutes we had to ask for bread, which was worth the wait btw.

We basically ordered to share, we got:

Chest nut soup (taste like a seafood bisque) which was delicious, light and flavorful.

The beet salad which wasn't my favorite but there was a lotus root chip YAY on top.

The fried artichoke hearts, the smaller pieces were crispy and delicious with the sauce, but the larger ones became a bit soggy.

The salmon was moist, lightly seasoned and along with the beans and rapini under was a perfect combo.

The beef cheeks and mash potatoes were so good! Albeit a bit heavy but good thing the portion wasn't huge. It was perfect to share both of those dishes to balance each other out,

The creme caramel and chocolate mousse were both delicious and the presentation was very pretty. 

Took a bit of time to ask for the bill, but otherwise everything else went well! 

They had Beau's and Flying Monkey on draft :)
