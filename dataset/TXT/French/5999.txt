3rj1qpgFvkRWtAka17mhEQ Horrible experience. Hostess sat us at a dirty table. Asked her to clean it, she said she would. Next she came back with napkins & silverware & placed them on the dirty table. Again I asked if our table could be cleaned & hostess said they should be over soon to clean it as she asked "them" to take care of it. Minutes pass... table is still dirty. Finally waitress shows up. Starts in on her greeting & I interrupt her to ask if our table could please be cleaned & informed her we asked the hostess & it was not done. She left to get us water & a man came and cleaned the table. Waitress returned & we placed our order. My daughter & I both ordered a turkey club with no tomatoes. My mom ordered a tuna melt. When our food arrived at the table all I could see was the tomatoes on our sandwiches!!! I made a comment about seeing the tomatoes & the waitress grabbed out plates up & said she'd take care of it... uh, seriously??? I already knew what that meant it meant she'd take it in the back the tomatoes would be removed & then they would be brought right back to us. Sure enough a few minutes later the waitress returned with our disheveled sandwiches that had been manhandled to remove the tomatoes. THIS IS NOT TAKING CARE OF IT!!! I don't like tomatoes period!!! Therefore I do not want the tomato juice & seeds left behind on my sandwich!!! I'm paying you for a service & would like the food made to my order specifications. It's not like I was asking for anything special or difficult. Simply leave off the tomatoes!!! Heck it is even saving you money. I'm still paying the same menu price for the item. Overall a horrible experience. Waitress seemed oblivious to how irritated I was. My mom actually loves this restaurant & was surprised at the poor service we received!
