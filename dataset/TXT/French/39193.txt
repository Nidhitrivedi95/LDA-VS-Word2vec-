JsAjP49bCk9KjJmmmjyM4w I find Clafouti to be pretty hit or miss.

In my experience, the almond croissant is the only thing that is consistently good. A couple of times I've gone the pastries seemed like they had been sitting for awhile. When the product is fresh, it's great -- but sadly, scoring a fresh treat is a gamble you'll have to take. 

Cash & debit only. Don't expect anything more than mediocre service.
