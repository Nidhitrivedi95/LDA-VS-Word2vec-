vLkKorA1gPS97Zj0_WKA0Q Just like everything at Mandarin Oriental: spectacular!
The tasting menu was one of the top three meals I have ever enjoyed.
The service exceptional and seamless. Not snooty or pretentious in any way.
Special mention to the Wagyu beef dish-the best steak I have ever eaten.  
The foie gras and foie gras ice cream side also perfection.
You cannot go wrong with this winner!
