YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g Finally made it here after bookmarking it for a yr.  Had brunch and hubby gave applauses to his ribs benedict.  Boys went crazy over the beignet.  Had one of the most expensive burger ever with foie gras $44.  Pretty good, but burgers aren't my thing but wanted to try it.  I wanted it medium, but it wasn't.  Red velvet pancakes were dry, nothing special.

I enjoyed it nonetheless!
