oS96aJIHFWcFAlGHKKXjaw I found this bakery shop accidentally.  But now  I will be returning to this shop purposefully.  The croissants melt in your mouth.  My daughter had a vegetable and feta cheese sandwich on an amazing ciabatta bun.  You may want consider going to La Gourmandine for lunch. The girl behind the counter was friendly and offered suggestions of breads to match my dinner.  Whether you are in Lawrenceville or not, I would seek out this bakery.
