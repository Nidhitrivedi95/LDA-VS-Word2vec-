3nWXxSCR6q7SVxHvsUUeWg These guys (and ladies) were at our Elementary School's Fall Festival. 
They were so nice! HUGE smiles, super friendly. The guy that took my order was a sweetheart and the lady who gave me my food was wonderful and smiley too! And hazelnut crepes? I died and went to heaven! Thank you for being there!
So good & so yummy! Their snow cones were also VERY POPULAR at the school and the line for them was HUGE for a long time! Well worth it!
