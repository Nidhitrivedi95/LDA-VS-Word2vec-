LnSjzFXh1GrOObsRP6LhBQ The decaf nonfat caffe latte to go was disappointing. There was no foam and the flavor of the beans didn't stand out. It cost around $5 which is the standard price these days. 

I didn't get food but the baked goods looked good and I've had one of their croissants about 6 months ago and it was quite flaky and good. 

The ambience is nice too, to do some work on your laptop, people watch if you're sitting at the window, or to meet a friend or a first date.

I wouldn't go out of my way to get my coffee from here or pastries. But if in the neighborhood and wanting to stay east of Bathurst I might pop in.
