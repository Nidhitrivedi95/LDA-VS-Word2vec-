I kept passing by this place on a recent short-stay Vegas word trip. Finally, on my way to the airport, I stopped by here to pick up a sandwich. The turkey sandwich on pecan bread to be more specific. And I loved it. 

The chocolate chip was cookie was good...not amazing, but a solid cookie.

Service was friendly enough, and I appreciated the offer to warm up the sandwich.
