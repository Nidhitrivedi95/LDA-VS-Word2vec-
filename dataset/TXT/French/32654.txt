gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg I really enjoyed my experience and the vibe of this place.
Didn't care for the blonde beer, but the lighter beer was good and the sangria was GREAT.

Enjoyed the poutine and another house speciality. The waitress was really nice and ordered us a taxi because our phones didn't work.

I would definitely go again!
