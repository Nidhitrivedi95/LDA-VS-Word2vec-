KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA Came here for surprise birthday dinner. We had a table on the water and it was beautiful but the mister was leaking right behind my chair. Visibly an easy fix but nothing was done about it. We ordered a bottle of wine and the waiter returned to inform us that they were out of that particular bottle which I found disappointing as it is also a wine store. We Had the octopus and clam chowder as apps. Octopus portion was small and lacking in the flavor department. The clam chowder was the best I've ever had. For entrees we had the ciopinno and braised beef ravioli. Both not very good, lacking flavor, and small portions. This was specifically annoying because we had asked the waiter about portion sizes since we were considering ordering a third entree to share and he assured us they were large portions "unlike most French restaurants". My pasta was BEYOND al dente, and the plating was sloppy. Wipe the rim people! It's not that hard. Complimentary gelato with a very crunch cookie for my birthday was nice to photograph. The sun set and swarms of these tiny bugs started circulating around our table. I was assured they weren't mosquitos but it definitely wasn't a good end to the night. Our waiter was nice but we definitely waited long periods of time for assistance. They don't check on you very often. I spilled a glass of water on Our very small table and we had to use our dinner napkins to clean it up ourselves. Our waiter didn't show up till about 10-15 min later. Usually when something like this happens swarms of waiters appear to help you and bring you new napkins or utensils. The Highlight of this meal was the guy playing live music. He was amazing.
