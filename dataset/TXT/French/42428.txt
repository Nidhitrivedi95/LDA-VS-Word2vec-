lcTa0q9Wo4wNyLCIgWFRUA The decor is very pleasant and vintage. The service was great. We had oysters, raspberry point from PEI. The mignonette was on cue. We had The French onion soup which was excellent. The foie gras on a raspberry coulis was amazing. The steak tartare was well done. We really enjoyed this place.
