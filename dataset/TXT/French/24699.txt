CodoVn98WzIP2_NC18NuCw What I will definitely remember from this restaurant is the amazing decor and ambiance there was. This place is huge, offers so many cool tables/ sections for groups, and they had a nice heated terrace, too. 

As per food, I have to say it was just OK. I felt like some dishes were overrated and not worth the price . I do remember trying a good beef tartar and delicious charcuteries, but the mains were so average - we had ribs and cornish hen. It has been a while since we've gone, so maybe they've improved since then, but I still am not sure this was worth the bill.
