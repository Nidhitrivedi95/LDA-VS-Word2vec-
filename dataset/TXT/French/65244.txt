u-SvRRAfYgpbXZRfQgcTzA Best izakaya in Montreal! After being disappointed by many imitation izakayas in the plateau and mile end (Thazard was atrocious), was happy to find this one! Great food, great service and fun ambiance. Gindara and ebimayo are the best. Finally, a legit Japanese food experience in Montreal.
