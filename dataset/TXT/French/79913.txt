ZrHU8ZzwZQjTRpB1K_8JTQ Simply marvelous. This is such a gorgeous building and they did a wonderful job at making it comfortable and spacious. I had the burger and you will need to pay attention to the cheese curd melted on it. Yum.  Enjoyed the mac and cheese and try the pierogi appetizer. Thats how you make pierogis. My husband had the steak and inhaled the Brussel sprouts. Good drinks and lovely lighting all around. Looking forward to the fish fry!!
