rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I frequent the Venetian and Palazzo as they are my go-to hotels whenever I am out in Vegas. I have always passed by this acclaimed restaurant and I finally decided to try it with my boyfriend. Everything we ordered was piquant and an absolute treat. The foie gras goes without saying. The restaurant itself is beautiful and creates a very romantic and intimate setting. I hope to dine here again!
