We travel often to Los Angeles, where we lived for many years after moving from Paris, France and our bistro in LA, Le Bizou (The Kiss) has the same menu offerings for far less and the owner, Phillipe, is actually from France. Onion soup for $14 is outrageous, we all know the ingredients and the price is not justified. Le Bizou offers the same Steak au Poivre also with pommes frites for $17.95 not $28. If a bistro in Los Angeles can offer the same dishes at a reasonable price why can't Zinc do it. Certainly the overhead in LA has to be much more than in Scottsdale. I am not asking people to travel to Le Bizou but just pointing out the difference in prices compared to the locale.
