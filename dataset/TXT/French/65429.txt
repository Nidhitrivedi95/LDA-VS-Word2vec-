u-SvRRAfYgpbXZRfQgcTzA Imadake has a really fun and lively atmosphere, and super delicious food! 

We made reservations for 11:00 PM on a Saturday evening, and we were seated right away even though the place was packed. Imadake is the perfect place to grab a drink with a couple of friends. The staff were really friendly and service was surprisingly fast even though the place was crowded. Their 'sake bombs' seem to be quite popular too! 

Food we ordered:

- Imadake Original Ramen ~$11.00 ( I highly recommend, the broth was so delicious!)
- Takowasa/ Wasabi Octopus ~$4.00 (Interesting dish, it was spicy at first but the spicy taste disappears quite fast)
- Aburi Shime Saba/ Blow torched Mackerel ~$6.50 (I love mackerel and this dish was cool because they blow torched the mackerel right in front of you!)
- Soft Shell Crab ~$10.00 (Delicious) 
- Yuzu Tuna Tataki/Seared Tuna Sashimi ~$11.00 (Super delicious!) 
- Matcha Cheesecake ~$6.00 (The cheesecake was a little heavy for me) 
- Drink: Malibu Mango ~$9.00 (This drink was so delicious, I highly recommend) 

Overall: Imadake is a perfect place for drinks - especially if you're going with a large group of friends. I'd recommend making reservations ahead of time because the place is quite packed, even at 11:00 PM at night. All the servers were really friendly and service was quite fast! I'd recommend the imadake original ramen - super delicious/rich ramen broth, and the malibu mango drink!
