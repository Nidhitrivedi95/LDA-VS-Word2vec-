You feel special walking in and the wait staff makes sure you feel that way. I made reservations to sit out in the patio overlooking the beautiful Wynn waterfall. I made sure to schedule when they're show their famous waterfall show. We had no problems being seated we were a party of four and were ushered right in as soon as we checked in.  

I had the prix fixe menu with the sweet corn soup as a starter, streak frites medium rare (perfectly cooked) to end a wonderful dinner with cocoa-crusted profiteroles. It was an amazing dinner only to be topped off a wonderful show and my fav part of it was when the frog sang "It is a wonderful life" and it sure was. 

My cousin ordered the roasted chicken and it was the best chicken I had ever tasted! And it's hard to be impressed with chicken as it is so commonly found. It was simply roasted really moist and filled with flavor. I would never thought that I'd look forward to ordering a roasted chicken dish at a beautiful french restaurant. 


The service was perfect and since we were on the patio it's not hard to feel a little chilly and they offered my mom and I a beautiful shawl to keep us warm and cozy. 

I look forward to coming back here. But I have to try Alex first lol. I've tried 2 consecutive Vegas vacations to get a reservation there but had no luck. So after Alex I'll be back here.
