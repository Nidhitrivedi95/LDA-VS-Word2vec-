hloS23Thw57IITw7_DLLOQ Montreal is known to be the best place for french cuisine when you are away from France.

I've been to Montreal many times and have always enjoyed the food, yet Le Parchemin was a "french food lover" paradise. 

Every dish that I sampled was prefect. 

The smooth texture of the Lobster Bisque, the incredible teste of Foie Gras, the perfect spicing of the Rack of Lamb and the incredible service made this dinner one of the best I have ever had.

This restaurant is highly recommended to anyone who loves french cuisine!
