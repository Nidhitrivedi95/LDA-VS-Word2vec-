aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw Just basing this review on the failed macarons.. I had high expectations heading to Bouchon for their macarons and was quite disappointed. My macarons had a paper thin spread of filling inside and weren't that great. I've had better ones. They are quite big and worth the price you pay for the size you do get compared to all of the other macaron shops I have tried. Will give it another try, but will try the Bouchon in Beverly Hills next time!
