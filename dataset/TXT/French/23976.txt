cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg One of the worst restaurants I have ever been to.

I came here with my boyfriend for his birthday. I got a reservation at the bar 2 months in advance. When we got there 5 minutes before our reservation, we had to wait in line for 15 minutes. Finally we got inside. We sat at the bar, right in front of the kitchen. Well, that was the first mistake. NEVER SIT AT THE BAR. It is tiny, dirty, and you smell food all the time, which made me getting sick and wanting to puke. 

The waiter took forever to come and he brought me a different drink than the one I ordered. He kept going from table to table and talking to the customers for like 15 minutes straight. So it was pretty much impossible to catch his attention if you needed anything. 

We ordered a starter that was deep fried foie gras. It was ok. Also, why would you deep fry foie grass. Stupid.

After we got the foie gras poutine. It was good but too much foie gras. This is when I started getting sick. Too much meat, gravy, foie grass, smell of the kitchen, food everywhere. It is just way too much. 

Then we ordered deer cake with livers and potatoes. It was terrible. I tried it and I felt  like puking so we just ordered it to go and went home and lied down.

Bill was like $100. I am never going to go back here. Also, for those prices I am expecting a clean place, with clean cutlery. The waiter didnt want to change my cutlery after I ate the poutine. Seriously?

Honestly, I dont understand why this place gets so many good reviews. Service sucks, drinks suck, prices suck, place itself is pretty gross and food is okay.
