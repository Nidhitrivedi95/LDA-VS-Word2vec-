pKiSzUlBBRNEdTML24piXA I rarely write outright negative reviews: there are many mediocre restaurants, and when I eat at one, I prefer to remain silent, writing instead to praise the great ones. (At the time of this writing, those include Nobuo, Christopher's, Quiessence, anything Bianco, Tuck Shop, and many more.) I sympathize with those trying to make a living in this business; I've worked in it. But I have to write. 

I went recently, and it was one of the worst meals I've had at a restaurant that aims higher than fast food. The Portuguese seafood stew was flavorless (except for the excess salt, which lingered on my tongue for hours) and filled with overcooked fish. Rather than a stew, it was many ingredients in search of a hand that could turn it into a dish. My companion's mussels were tough, and swimming in an unsubtle wine sauce.  

These folks have a great location. I am hopeful that the positive reviews mean that the two dishes I sampled were an exception. But they were so bad that I won't be back.
