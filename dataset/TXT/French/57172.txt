rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Ooo la la! Bouchon is da bomb! First of all, I was there with my 2 sisters on a girls getaway and Bouchon serves Island Creek Oysters which are harvested in our hometown-- a cool and delicious coincidence. I had the soup du jour as an appetizer. Not everyone likes cold soups, but I do and this one was the best I have ever had. It was cucumber and leek and it was perfect in every way. When the waiter placed it on the table we all gasped because it was SO beautiful. The presentation was bright green and gorgeous with a dollop of pastel yellow and a bright orange disk in the center. I should have photoed, sorry. The texture was silken, not cloying, but almost creamy. If I were teaching at a culinary institute this soup would be the exemplar for layered flavors. It literally made me moan like Meg Ryan in "When Harry Met Sally." I can't even describe the interplay of the clean vegetables, the bright citrus, the flirty white pepper at the end. Oh Chef! It was divine! 
For entrees, we had one pork, one fish, one quiche. I can't comment on the fish and pork because I'm a vegetarian, but the spinach quiche was fluffy and yummy. 
For dessert, we shared profiteroles and chocolate mousse. Both of these were beyond amazing. The chocolate mousse was, in my sister's opinion, "the most chocolatiest thing in the world." It's served with cute little bits of lady finger cookies in the shape of spoons. Perfect for sharing. Delicious and adorable. The profiteroles were even more impressive. Again the layered flavors blew us away. 
Our waiter was cute and nice, but at Bouchon, it's all about the food. Magnifique!
