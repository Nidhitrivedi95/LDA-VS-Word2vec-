This place gets super packed during the dinner rush. Even dining at the counter gets full.

I'd recommend the foie gras duo to get the best out of APC. If you're dining with friends, then I'm sure you can taste each other's food. But for a single diner like myself, the foie gras duo comes with Foie Gras burger and foie gras poutine fries. Huge portions for about $50. Very fatty, very rich, and very good.

I started off with the tuna tartare as an appetizer, but even though it is a small portion, I couldn't get through my foie gras duo because of the enormity of the portions. The tuna tartare was tarty and fresh.

And I still wanted dessert after and I chose the toffee maple milk shake. They made it right in front me...I guess because I was in the counter, but you can see all the fatty goodness when they make this. Not to sweet, but I had enough room to finish it. I would order this again.

Trying to find street parking might be hard for you during dinner time. And the metro station is several blocks away. You can probably try the bixi bikes if you have time to roam around this part of the Montreal neighborhood.
