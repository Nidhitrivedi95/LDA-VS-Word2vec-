WOO81gScY3_VpaIfXFAKpw I went last night for dinner for my friend's birthday. They open at 5PM for dinner. We were the only ones there and they seated us up front so we could watch the action. We loved that. It is no longer 5 courses, but 3. However it is a lot of food. 
We both started with a Cesar salad. It was on a flat bread which was delicious. They also gave us a sample of I believe a salmon tartar. I did not taste it as I  do not eat seafood. I had the steak Diane and it was very good. the steak was cooked perfectly and the potatoes and carrots were a great accompaniment. My friend had the salmon and loved it. The deserts were outstanding and beautiful I had the lava cake my friend the fruit dish. 
The service was great. The food was great. The price was great. Can't wait to go back.
