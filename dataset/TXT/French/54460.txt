rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw Bloody Mary is a total pass. 
Order oysters and escargot. Stick to omelettes and eggs. I order croque madame only to be completely disappointed by a heavy béchamel sauce soaked untoasted or very lightly toasted piece of white bread with not melted cheese and a runny egg. 
The mgr Roberto took these items off the bill and it's the only reason I give 3 stars and would go back. 

This place is a choice of connivence being that you want shellfish and don't want to leave aria. And yes and it has its stars and busts on the menu. Gotta just eat your way around the land mines.
