1st time, a positive review
====================
I was impressed the first time I came and gave this place 4 out of 5 stars, knocking off the 1 star due to service. The waiter was friendly but VERY forgetful. It seemed his mind was elsewhere. Even waving our arms in the air while making eye contact with him couldn't get his attention. 


Update:  July 11, 2012
------------------------------
Last night, though, I returned and was VERY disappointed with the service and food. The first time, I had only a cheese plate and wine, both being very good. This 2nd time, our group ordered main entrées and shared a cheese plate to start. 


2nd visit, a bad experience
======================
I had reserved a table in the back patio asking to be placed as far away as possible from the smoking section. (Why they have a smoking and non-smoking section on the same patio is beyond me.) The lady on the phone said she'd note the request. Well, turned out our table was right NEXT to the smoking section. DUH? 

Fine, I understand a "request" can't always be honored, so I let that slide. But I still think it's unfair to allow smoking on both patios. Why not designate one for smoking and the other for non-smoking? Better yet, make the pretty back patio for non-smokers. 


Rude, Ignorant Waiter
=================
Anyway, the waiter last night had attitude and was clueless. No, really. He brought over our cheese platter and simply plopped it on our table and walked away without explaining what was what. We called him over and asked him to explain what the cheeses were and to bring us bread. 

He returned and rattled off very quickly as if he couldn't be bothered wasting his time. "This cheese is that, this is that...etc." (I think he had to quickly ask a colleague to tell him beforehand!)

I was startled when he said "This cheese is Ossau-Iraty from Quebec." Uh, not. It's from the Basque region of France, near the Spanish border. But he insisted I was wrong. I know my Basque cheese, so I said "Not at all."

A few minutes later he returned after having verified and said "You're right it's from France."  Duh.

Sorry, but for $28 for 4 small wedges of cheese, I expect a server who:  a) explains what each cheese is at the time he brings the platter, and b) knows SOMETHING about cheese. 

But when I tasted the cheese, I knew right away he had gotten mixed up the Ossau-Iraty with the cheese from Quebec, and vice versa. He was right in pointing to the Quebec cheese, but he named it wrong. I didn't tell him this cuz I knew he wouldn't give a rat's arse, and it wouldn't be worth my time. But come on, for these prices, the least you can do is to identify the cheeses correctly!


BAD Food
=========
But the biggest disappointment was the food. We ordered the penne pasta with chicken and chorizo in a tomato basil sauce. You can get it mild or spicy. I ordered mild, my friend spicy. Both were very bland, and the pasta was soft, overcooked, not al dente. 

I make pasta 10x better than that at home!  And for $18, this was a HUGE letdown. The quality of this pasta was I'd expect to find in a mall food court. 


The hostess, however, was very good and on top of things. 

After my 1st visit, I said I'd return, but now I know I won't. The waiter last night was clueless and with attitude, and the pasta was really pathetic.
