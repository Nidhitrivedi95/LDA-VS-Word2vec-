SBnpT6JDbah-5l_52GM5sw I have been to Sardine about 5 times now- mostly for brunch and a few times for dinner.  I really like this restaurant.  Its easy to park, great rustic decor, nice lakeside ambience, and a friendly waitstaff.  

I think that Sardine is the only place in Madison that I would be comfortable eating oysters!  They have great cocktails and I love sitting at the bar with a drink and a few apps.  

I do prefer sitting on the lake side though I know its not always possible.  Its one of our Madison mainstays!
