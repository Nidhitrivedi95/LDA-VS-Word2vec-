SFnrHuVFSNiondFVUBLJZQ Cute little diner in the heart of old Montreal. We made reservations and sat outside. It was a nice area of town and good people watching. We ordered cheese fondue- delicious - with bread fruits and veggies. We also ordered and ham and cheese crepe with bechamel sauce- YUM, and we ordered escargot covered sigh cheese and garlic. Legit!  It was like a trip to France! And we ordered a bottle of Chardonnay! Super delicious, intimate meal on one of the oldest streets in Montreal! Would highly suggest making reservations and sitting outside. We were happy with all of our food selections !
