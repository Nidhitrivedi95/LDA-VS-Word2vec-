1iDBWrwjfk4w_ThhL_qTYQ Sad to say, not a great experience.  We were looking forward to trying out Bistro as is in the neighborhood.   Buster's, the previous tenants,  had been a favorite location.  

Unforturnately, when I arrived, ahead of an associate, for lunch on a weekday, there were no greeters. The decor was okay.  The staff didn't look "fresh" and eager to please.  The owner (I presumed) was arguing in French with another worker.

Upon being seated, no explanation of the menu or beverage options.  
I ordered the day's special, a Lorraine Mushroom Crepe which arrived sans garnishment.  Mushroom soup was average and a bit too salty.  My associate, had one of the "artisan" sandwiches which arrived appearing like half a sub from subway, sans garnishment.  Plop.....sandwich only. 
For the price of $13 a serviing, defintely the price point did not equal the value or taste.

Dinner may be a different experience?

That said, they really need to spray the overhang on the patio for bugs and wash the chairs outdoors. I don't even want to know what was on the sides of the chairs and thank goodness didn't see them until we were leaving.  eeek

Rated two stars as the food was edible and the view of the lake pleasant.  They really need to step it up to remain in business.  There are so many other great options in the same area.


Enough said.
