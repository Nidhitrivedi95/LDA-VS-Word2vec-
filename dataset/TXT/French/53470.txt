QlSpPzc4Oy05ic-PsoYH4g I have been looking forward to coming to Streets on Carson ever since it first opened. I always look at coming here for dinner on the weekend and it's always packed. On Sunday morning we were looking for a new brunch spot & chose Streets on Carson! 

When we arrived there were only 2 other people eating at the bar who left shortly after we arrived. We were the only people in there for about 1 1/2 hours which was surprising to me. We were quickly greeted by our waitress who was super nice and attentive. The atmosphere inside is also super cool. They have graffiti on the walls and all of the tables are named after different South Side streets- super cute idea! I was getting ready for Sunday Funday- so started off with a mimosa and Chris ordered the spicy bloody mary. Both were great drinks! 

My issue with brunch is I can never decide if I want the "br" or "unch" part of it. Lucky for me, Chris couldn't decide either so we chose to get both and split! Immediately, the Chiliquiles caught me eyes. The best way to describe this dish is breakfast nachos. It had homemade tortilla chips, scrambled eggs, chorizo, salsa, peppers & queso. It was delicious! We also split the All American Classic-merica burger. It had caramelized onions and bacon on it and was served with fries. This burger was pretty good but I have had better. After looking through Yelp reviews & pictures, I can't wait to come back for dinner and try their dinner options.
