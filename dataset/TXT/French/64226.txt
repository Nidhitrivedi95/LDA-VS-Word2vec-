tCSlpwJQ4CZsUEMZeH2SFg My hubby and I arrived 3 minutes before our reservation time and were seated at a table back in the restaurant. Cozy, Parisian atmosphere and our waiter was prompt to our table. We ordered a Hendricks Martini and a glass of merlot which were quickly delivered. Once we got our drinks we ordered the rest of our meal. Escargot in puff pastry and Brie en croutes arrived, but only five minutes later our entrees arrived. We told the server we needed more time. About ten minutes later our entrees came back but my beef Wellington was medium well instead of medium rare when I cut it through. We sent it back and I had lobster and crab crepes which were delicious.
We ate creme brûlée which was yummy and brought home chocolate raspberry mousse cake.
I'm looking forward to trying Cafe Monte again!
