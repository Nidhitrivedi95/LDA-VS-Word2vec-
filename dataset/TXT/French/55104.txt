rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Came here for brunch, and I got to say I was pretty impressed. This French styled restaurant in situated in the the Venetian, and the place's grandeur and food is worth the experience. So me and family came here, got seated within 5 minutes, and were treated to good, but not great service. We waited for a while to get our entrees  (25-35 minute wait), and since I have a tendency to act a bit impatient, I felt a bit disappointed in the wait time. But hey it's a fancy French restaurant, long wait times are expected for a well crafted dish. 
So I got to savor the Ham steak and eggs, and that was just delicious. The ham was just smoked to perfection, and the eggs I asked to scrambled was very good too. My sister had probably the best dish, which was the Croque Madame, which was a grilled ham and cheese sandwich, with a fried egg on top, and french fries on the side. It was a pretty big portion for a sandwich, and tasting just a part of it was just sex. My mouth is watering just thinking about it right now. The cost came out to be nearly 90 (4 people) for the tab, but I have to say it's worth it compared to eating at a buffet, where your stomach would be subject to gluttony and unhealthy decisions. I would like to come back to this place again when Vegas is on my mind again.
