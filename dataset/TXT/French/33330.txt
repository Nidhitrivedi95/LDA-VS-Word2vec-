hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA Let's be honest.. this is hipster and trendy and close to other businesses. For guys the eye candy here is phenomenal.. the coffee drinks are great!! I love illy. The main issue is the portion sizes for what you pay for.  You have to look for the deal on the daily specials. I would come back here just for the coffee.. but I like to eat and I like to feel full leaving a spot.. this in not the place for that. The customer service is awesome and everyone behind the counter is super friendly.. So I guess the rumors about the french are lies... Well french-americans are friendly!! ;)
