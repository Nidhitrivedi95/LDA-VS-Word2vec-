6GCbZASjMnAPYBWLc_z30g I was here saturday afternoon. my waitress, kaci was exceptionally friendly. I got the hibiscus to drink which was quite refreshing. the crab fritters and crab cakes were delicious. Their chocolate mousse and apple pie was everything my taste buds were looking for. all around very pleased.
