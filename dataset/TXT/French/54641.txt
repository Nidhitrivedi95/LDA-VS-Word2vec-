rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw This is a relatively new restaurant in Aria. The setting is romantic and quiet. Service is excellent.

I ordered the warm beet and goat cheese salad, foie gras parfait and 1/2 dozen oysters. The foie gras with the port gelee is to die for, super creamy and tasty,

The oyster is pretty small and don't think it is any special.

The warm beet salad is excellent.

I highly recommend this place for brunch!!
