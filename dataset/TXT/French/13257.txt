4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw My hubby and I could see this restaurant from our balcony and it looked so adorable. 
We headed over about 7 on a Thursday night and it was packed. We waited about 30 minutes, at the bar, before being seated on the patio. It was worth the wait.
The ambiance and energy is fantastic.
We ordered a bone-in Ribeye, medium, and shared some sides. It was perfectly cooked. It was perfectly seasoned and it ended feeding us this morning too.
The fries were exactly how my grandma used to make them. They were not oily. They were thin, crisp, and piping hot. 
The drinks were pricey but delicious and our waiter was absolutely on point. He met every need without smothering us. 
It was an ideal experience for us.
