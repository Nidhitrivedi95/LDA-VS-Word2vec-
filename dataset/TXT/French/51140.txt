p2OvNFiFKnRoWSRON4-lcA Not too bad. They have a good wine list and a pretty good dinner set that will leave you satisfied. They pride themselves of their creme brûlée but I think the caramelised sugar is a little too thick for my liking. Overall it's above average. I like how the restaurant is actually in a house so it absolutely cosy and warm. Good for groups :)
