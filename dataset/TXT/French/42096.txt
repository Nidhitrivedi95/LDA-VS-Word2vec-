KWoXY9-R00NY-Rv_MSNwaQ We had a lovely time in Montreal, but a TERRIBLE experience at La Marée. They literally kicked us out of the restaurant because we intended to ONLY spend $40-45 on appetizers, desserts and drinks.  Unless we wanted a full multi-course dinner with entrees, they did not want our business.

When we asked to speak to the manager, we were told he wasn't there. When we asked for his card, we were told he didn't have one. Then the gentleman who kicked us out PERSONALLY INSULTED me when I told him I would write the restaurant a negative review.

For the record, I never raised my voice. We were not boisterous customers. They simply didn't want to give a table over to a couple that might spend $30 less than someone else.

Of course, this all went down only after we waited (literally) at least 20-25 minutes for a waitress to even show up and speak to us. The ONLY bright spot of the experience was that their greeter successfully managed to greet us without insult.
