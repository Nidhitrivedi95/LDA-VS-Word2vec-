rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w We scheduled Le Cirque as our fancy dinner of our vacation. Of all the options we had in Vegas, I am glad this was the place.
Spectacular service - we felt like we were the only people in the restaurant. They were attentive at every step of the dinner, even though we opted for the simple tasting menu. They really sought to make our experience special. 
The food was incredible - fine French dining at its best. My wife had the foie gras, the cod and the creme brulee. I opted for the tartare, rabbit and suflee. All choices were excellent. And drinks were incredible. 
Overall, if you are looking for a fine dining experience in Vegas, you can't go wrong with Le Cirque.
