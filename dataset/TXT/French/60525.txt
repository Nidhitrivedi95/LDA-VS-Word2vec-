SBnpT6JDbah-5l_52GM5sw We had a lovely experience here, while visiting from Chicago. The ambiance is great - charming decor, lovely staff. We started with the Charcuterie plate and for entrees we had the Trout and the Duck Confit salad. Both were delicious. Our server was the perfect balance of attentive yet not intrusive - great timing. We'd definitely come back!
