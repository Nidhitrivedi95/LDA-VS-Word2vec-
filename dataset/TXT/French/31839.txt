Gu-xs3NIQTj3Mj2xYoN2aw Tried their set dinner. It's a good value meal; with soup, entree, dessert and coffee/tea all around the mid $20s range. 

I would want to come back for their weekday lunch deals at $14.95 which include appetizer, main course, a piece of cake, and coffee/tea. Weekends are $1 more. 

Nice service, spacious, and clean. The best part is it's one of the rare Chinese run restaurants that are not noisy. :p
