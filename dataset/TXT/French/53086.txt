QeFsIMcIFIJcOrpthYL8jg Went here for anniversary. Great place. Made a reservation for 8, but was in the area earlier and was seated at 6pm with no issues. They told us we needed to be out by 8, so they could use the table which was weird. but we weren't rushed by our waitress and seated immediately. So many thanks there to the great staff.

Ordered beet salad for an appetizer and it was tremendous. All the ingredients were very fresh. For an entree, i ordered the duck confit and mushroom risotto. Where the risotto lacked in salt and flavor, the duck made up for. Cooked perfectly. The beau ordered lamb chops, which she said lacked any kind of flavor, so that along with my risotto is the reason for the 4 stars. I'd visit again, perhaps try something else.
