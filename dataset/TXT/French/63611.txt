t1mR_Zff6Dqv1TueE2JLEA Came here for winterlicious, for the $15 lunch menu, which was amazing considering the price. 

The appetizer was a beef spring roll, which was delicious, the beef burger was amazing it was topped with caramelized onions and raisons, and for dessert was brownies. The foo was really good considering I had a bad experience at the Sultan's Tent. 

The interiors were beautifully decorated, very Moroccan and authentic. The best part of the entire dining experience was our server. She was amazing, and very sweet. She served our food on time, gave us suggestions, and even provided us with complimentary speciality drink (sprite with passion fruit, and pomegranate juice). This is an amazing drink, and I would highly recommend going here for the customer service and drink. Shamy was excellent, and has a great personality. 

I am very happy and satisfied with Cafe Moroc, and I highly recommend going here and I will be back here again soon.
