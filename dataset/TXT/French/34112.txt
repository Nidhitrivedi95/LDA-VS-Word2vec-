hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA Service was great and food was amazing! This is definitely a go to place for hanging out on their large patio area with a latte and/or breakfast/lunch. I'm happy that Baguette Cafe exists here in Las Vegas and even more thrilled that the location is near my house! Their quiche is freaking amazing and croissants are absolutely perfect. Great place too for new moms to hang out with their babies. I'm definitely coming back for mommy dates :)
