kGOr_D-LNpgZ2M9N8TT4QQ As a valentine day dinner, we chose to treat our self with this fancy French restaurant, but this treat wasn't all that sweet. Firstly, this place is gorgeous! Starting with its stain glass iconic doors, upscale, and rich interior, they fit well with Gucci store across street. The service was impeccable; fun, kind, and quick. In fact they had called us to make sure we could find the place before hand! The ambiance was true to its Parisian roots, the waiters too spoke the dishes with true French accents. However, now for the downsides of this stellar establishment: the food. The menu is very limited and nothing jumps out. I had gotten the Cassoulet and my valentine got the Linguine. The beans of the Cassoulet were favorable but easily tiring. The pork and sausage were good, but nothing special. The duck was raw, but that's probably because I forgot to ask for well done. The Linguine was great at the start but later became too much due to the thick cream. The food was a serious let down. However this could have been due to poor choice on my part, also I wasn't able to the try the dessert. The pricing was quite high, but that's to be expected with such a location. I will definitely give this place another try.
