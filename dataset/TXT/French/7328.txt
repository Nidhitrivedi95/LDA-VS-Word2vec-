4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I only ordered a steamed artichoke here, so I can't opine on the food (although I did steal a bite of my friend's club sandwich and it was delicious). 

Five stars for their bloody mary bar. Brilliant! The waiter brings you a glass of vodka over ice. You do the rest - the bloody mary bar offers both tomato juice and bloody mary mix, every single hot sauce manufacutured in the world, worcestershire sauce, horseradish, celery, pickled asparagus, pickled onions, olives (you can also ask them to bring you blue cheese stuffed olives). It was the perfect way to end our Vegas weekend (well, winning back the money I lost in blackjack would have been perfect, but this was close enough). 

We went on a Sunday, so not sure if the bloody mary bar is a Sunday brunch offering only, or whether it's there all the time. We sat outside, which offers a great view of Bellagio's fountain show, as well as excellent people watching (love what people can get away with (not) wearing in Vegas!)
