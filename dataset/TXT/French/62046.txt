SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ This is a cute place to dine on a nice afternoon when the weather is bearable outside. Nestled inside a tree (so it seems) is a friendly service restaurant with a unique and relaxing dining atmosphere; from the huge outdoor fire pit to the bar inside a second tree! The food was delish and they actually put real rasberries inside my ice tea!! Amazing!!!
