T4g4k2OhCTsiqcP-ZXElHQ Took my girlfriend here for her birthday, made a reservation half a month before (which I recommended doing, it's SUPER busy). Ordered Lamb for Two, and a birthday cake for us, we enjoyed the food so much and the service was great.

At one point, we were both very sad. Because the table next to us ordered Lamb for Two, BUT they didn't even look at the ratatouille or touch it!!!! When the waiter took it away, we shed a tear. OTL
