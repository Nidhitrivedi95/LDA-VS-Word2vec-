gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA My husband took me to Alize on Christmas Eve and it was one of the best presents I have gotten! We are both "foodies" and could not wait to try the chef's 7 course tasting menu with wine pairings. Even the amuse-bouche was delicious and really did it's job of waking up our taste buds. My favorites were the phylo wrapped crab claw, fois gras, and rib eye. The truffle vinaigrette on the spinach salad is something to pay close attention to, they did a very good job of not overpowering with the truffle taste as is so easy to do. 

The staff was extremely warm and friendly, not at all pretentious or stuck up. Our waiter, I think his name was Silvio, extremely professional and knowledgeable. He explained all the courses in just enough detail and also the wine pairings and why they were chosen for that particular dish. We received attention to our table at all the right times and never once needed to look around the restaurant floor wondering where our waiter or busboy was. Of course, who wants to look around the restaurant when you have one of the best views of the strip in all of Las Vegas! We were lucky enough to have a window side table in the corner that faces everywhere from Encore and TI down to Luxor. We also very much enjoyed the classy, elegant atmosphere over some other restaurants that try to be too trendy with loud house music and waitresses wearing lingerie. One more thing to pay attention to on the way to the elevator- the nearly 200 year old bottles of cognac that line the entryway. 

The one downside of Alize is right around 10 PM. you can hear the subtle rumbling of the bass from whatever club is upstairs. Very unfortunate that this is how we had to end our very romantic Christmas Eve dinner. Other than that, I can say nothing other than praise for Alize and their staff.
