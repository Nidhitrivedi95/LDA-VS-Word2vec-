Style of their cuisine is more rustic and hearty French than sophisticated and meticulous ones, but they taste pretty good. I didn't like escargot by themselves, but having it with bone marrow made them great and new. The server knocked over the wine and water one time, but he recovered well and was not affected in the service afterwards, so I'd give him a plus. ;)
