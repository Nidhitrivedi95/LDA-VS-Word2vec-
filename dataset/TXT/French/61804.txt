sphMzEIqY1I2Dzv3zLZY2g I had heard a lot of great things about Global but I don't make it out to Ballantyne that often.  If you are in the area, it is definitely worth checking out.  Now we just know what to order next time:

Appetizers: The portions are perfectly sized (not as small as Good Food, but not like something from Maggiano's either). 

Quail: I really like quail and the menu indicated that this was their "signature dish" so I figured it would be outstanding. This was the only app we didn't finish. It was not very good at all (again, coming from someone who generally loves quail)

Berkshire Pork Belly: Described by our waiter as a "big piece of bacon" it was pretty flavorful, but definitely on the fatty side.  I know that is the definition of pork belly but I can see how it would be off-putting to some. I really enjoyed the bed of lentils it came on. We finished it but wouldn't order it again.

Eggplant and Greek Olive Spring roll: THIS is what I am talking about.  This was by far our favorite dish of the night. It comes with a goat cheese and honey sauce that is good enough to drink. I'm going to try to replicate it for sure. 

We also shared the sea bass entrée which was very good. They put the Sriracha on the side since my husband doesn't really care much for spicy. 

Split the nougat glace dessert which was incredible. It reminded me of a dessert I had in St. Barth's on our honeymoon. Not too heavy or sweet, but just enough to hit the spot! 

The restaurant was slammed, so the service was a little slow, but still very friendly. A quaint, cozy and delicious restaurant that was not at all stuffy.  Definitely a nice change of atmosphere!
