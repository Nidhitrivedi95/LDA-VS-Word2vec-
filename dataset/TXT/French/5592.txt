3jKUbhGSjFTv5jZ0wnW0xA I would say this is a 3.5 to 4. The ambience was great-- we sat outside and felt like we were in Europe. Our server was super sweet, but service was a tad slow. Good thing we had all the time in the world. The food was good-- not life-changing, but good. We had the French onion soup (yum!), mussels in white wine sauce, and filet mignon.

All things considered, a great dinner overall.
