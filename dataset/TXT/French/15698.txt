6fPQJq4f_yiq1NHn0fd11Q Best savory and dessert French style crepes! ..if they get everything that's supposed to be in it that is. Crepes are BIG, can be shareable, fairly priced to me. 

The crepes themselves are super buttery. I could eat it with just the homemade chantilly cream and I'd be happy, but why stop there? I go for the nutella crepe without bananas. Have asked it with strawberry a few times and have gotten it with it twice; sometimes they'll say yes, most times it's a no lol. The hazelnuts are addicting. The fresh berry crepe is also a good choice. They don't lather the crepe too much with the strawberry compote, then you got the fresh blueberries and blackberries on top. That big dollop of chantilly cream will be gone before you know it.

Going the savory route, anything with the bechamel sauce is good imo,  because that sauce is just luxurious. Do try the shrimp scampi and roasted chicken, you'll find yourself craving it at times. Sometimes they skimp on the shrimp though..

Ordered the roasted chicken crepe during a busy time and they completely forgot the bechamel sauce.. without it the crepe was so dry and bland. No biggie though, told them there was no sauce, they handed it to us on the side and we got more bechamel than had they put it on.

Sometimes it's really busy,  sometimes it's not, but you gotta be patient for sure. It'll be worth it.
