2B46bRpDh49eDyjXGhL_ZQ Real genuine French crepes and galettes.  We felt like we were back in France. My husband had the France galette, and I had the chicken, mushroom and swiss cheese galette. They were amazingly good, tasting just how they did in France. A galette is a crepe made with buckwheat instead of flour, and used with meat, cheese and vegetables. I wanted to try the crepes but I was too full after eating my galette.  We will be back for the galettes and I want to have one of the delicious looking crepes.
