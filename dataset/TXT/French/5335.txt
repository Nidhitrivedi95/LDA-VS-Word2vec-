3FlWR_osNPb8dcqLgHebHw Two stars = "Meh. I've experienced better".  Which is exactly how I feel.  But, I am giving it 3 because the service was "A-ok".  I like to round up.

My husband and I came here looking for a new breakfast place.  The service was ok, the food was pretty Meh.  I had eggs florentine benedict.  It probably sat in the window for a good 5 minutes, my potatoes were cold and the english muffin was stale.  Can't remember what Nick got. 

Its really close to my house so I was hoping to find a place to frequent on Sundays that is walking distance.  I'm going to look elsewhere.
