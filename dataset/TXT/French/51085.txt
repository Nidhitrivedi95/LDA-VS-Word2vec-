P2g6xo5vZSEeGSr9tftLeg Yes please to everything on the menu in every permutation.

The focus of this place is their tartar. You can have all kinds of proteins (scallops, veal, duck, beef, shrimp, lobster, tuna, etc) and you can do it in all kinds of styles (itallian, asian, japanese, mexican, etc).

They also have a great selection of oysters and some interesting larger entrees. This is a hidden gem in montreal and i can't wait to go back. Everything was exceptional. Memorable to me though is itallian duck and japanese white tuna.


Much love for this place.
