K-b7obYsM_meX_GAd7rJTw My friends and I regularly get together at Le Comme Chez Soi in the evenings and for brunch. There is a full liquor license and it's quiet enough to hear each other speak. The best of both worlds. I cannot say the same for other bars in and around Saint-Laurent.

Recently, I celebrated my birthday there with 30 of my friends. There was enough seating for everyone with room to spare!

The chef, Stefane, is very sweet and accommodating. He made us feel like we were right at home. Speaking with him, it was clear that he loves to make other's feel at home, comfortable and well fed.

What you don't get at Le Comme Chez Soi is your typical bar crowd. Nor will have an upscale crowd of overdressed men and women. This is not a pick up joint, or an upscale restaurant. It's a place you can go to celebrate with your close friends life's little achievements.
