4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Located at the Paris hotel in Viva Las Vegas, this is by far the best French restaurant on the strip. 

For appetizers we ordered baked cheese and it did not disappoint. The filet mignon is cooked in a red wine reduction. I now understand what a tender and flavorful filet is supposed to taste like. A friend ordered the skirt steak and said it was also very good. The house red merlot was also very impressive.

For dessert, we shared the bread pudding. Again another home run!

To get the full experience, ask to be seated outside and enjoy the view of the bellagio fountains (on a weekend expect a long wait for outdoor.

Went back with on girls trip and it did not disappoint!
