4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I expected more from this place for the price. One tip is to not order steak from here. I ordered the fillet and it was bland and too saucy. If you want great steak for the same price, go to Joe's! I do have to say that the fries were great! They are light and crunchy! If you like escargot, order it from here. I also liked the warm baguette they bring out!
