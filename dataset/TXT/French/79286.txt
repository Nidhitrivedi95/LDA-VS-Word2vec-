ZgiSgTwHOoxdfi0unI36Mg I don't expect much from hotel restaurants, but Gazette was wonderful classic French food. I would eat here again in a heartbeat.  

The bread that came to the table had several butter options, including bleu cheese, and even olives. My lamb shank was gigantic and wonderfully soft, the meat just falling away. My dining companion had a salad to start, and at first I was envious, but if I had ordered one, there was no way I would have been able to eat the delicious brûlée for dessert.
