K64Uw3a2Enh2MznpwRHWKQ I am sorry, I am unsure what everyone was taking about. This is not the place for fine dining. The food in general was basic. 

I ordered the halibut . It was VERY dry. The sides are mash and steamed veggies. The Veggies, where not steamed enough, and mash seemed old. Ordered Fries for the baby, and they had an strange oil taste. Another ordered a few other meals , and they were not happy either. 

The waiter our table had was strange, and did something weird with the tipping and tax at the end..to get more money. Still pondering it now. 

The Presentation was nice. I would of thought it was going to be great, with all the compliments. It is small inside as well. Honestly It was abit dead on a fri night. Now I know why. Will not repeat.
