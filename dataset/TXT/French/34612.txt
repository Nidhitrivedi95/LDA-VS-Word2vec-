HojKatUfX4UHWaPqtl63NQ We ate here last night, and we were able to sit out on the patio, overlooking all the bright city lights. The ambiance was phenomenal. Rather than ordering entrees, we ordered and shared several small plates, and they were all fantastic. The service was also excellent. This is a must, especially if you are staying at the Delano or Mandalay Bay.
