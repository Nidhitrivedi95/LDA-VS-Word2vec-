5fquJHY2hMX9tPRD5s0t5g My wife and I went for our first time last night and I have to say the food was very good.  We had two issues that, in my opinion were not handled well.  First, the restaurant was not very crowded and our waitress seemed over her head.  On two occasions the manager had to step in and on one another waitress stepped in.  Then we ordered the coconut cake which was totally dried out.  The manager came by to apologize for the new chef's mistake.  Now I do not expect to get anything free but after the excessive bad service and bad desert, comping the second "replacement desert" would have been a gracious gesture.  I am sure we will go back but if we have a repeat experience it will be the last time.
