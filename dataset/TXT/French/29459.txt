f2w9rH1gFJ4GJDNq3hvVFw We are foodies so when we went to Montreal we didn't go to the museums or churches we just ate our way through the town.  We were looking for the popular restaurant called Au Pied de Cochon when we stumbled on this little restaurant - which is a block away.  Well, we make it back the next night because my husband who is French had a nanny from the little island Ile de Reunion -which is the cuisine of the restaurant. So he was so intrigued that not even in NYC there's a place like this.  So we went.  The hostess/co-owner Chantal was great, it was a BYOB place and the food was great and my husband said it reminded him of the food his nanny used to make.  So for those who wants a little spice in their food this is the place and I will make it back there again when we return to Montreal,  Love it!
