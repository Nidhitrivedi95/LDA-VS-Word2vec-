xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g This is one of the most romantic resteraunts I have ever been to in Las Vegas. The staff will always be smiling and proper and greet you with elegance. The ambiance and lighting are extremely romantic specially when eating a dessert. Can't wait to come see you guys in a few weeks!
