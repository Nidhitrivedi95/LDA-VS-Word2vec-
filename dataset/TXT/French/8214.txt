4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw We are here on a Saturday night. The atmosphere was nice but we had a terrible experience with our waiter and the meal. We had three people in our party. The waiter messed up the orders and brought one meal before the others and before the appetizer. Then they brought an appetizer salad with the meal. The steak orders were wrong, the soup and fries were cold. Even our after dinner coffee was cold. We were not rude about what was wrong but wanted things warm and Instead of the waiter attempting to fix the errors, he got snippy and threw the check at us. Not an experience that is acceptable at any restaurant much less at a high end place like this.
