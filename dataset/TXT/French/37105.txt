iQJ0IvKNbOh_6DSkUCv9dQ I have to say that the only good thing about Marcel's was the attention from the waiter.
The decor is completely out of date, scary even.
The menu is unimpressive and the wine list... what to say besides ummf.
The food was way over priced for the quality offered.
We had the chicken supreme (far from it's name) and the stake and fries (tenderloin rich in tendons) both smothered in an incredible tasteless sauce and acompanied with funky tasting greens and the fries were refried in old oil (the burt tast lasted for hours even after washed down with wine).
In summary, stay away from Marcel's Bistro and put your money in a nice dinner somewhere else.
