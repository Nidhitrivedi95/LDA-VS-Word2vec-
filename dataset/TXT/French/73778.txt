xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g Was there a couple of weeks ago to celebrate her 21st bday!!!
She surprised me by saying we were heading here for dinner.  

The atmosphere and food was awesome.  
The souffle was awesome.
They did help celebrate her BDAY with an extra dessert surprise.
The ambience and view made the price worthwhile...and the food was the kicker.

The only thing that we had issue was with a/c that was blowing right over us...so at the end of the dinner..we were pretty cold.
