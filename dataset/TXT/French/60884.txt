SD7vTf-H00J8BS3L-kt7jg I had probably one of the worst experiences at a restaurant ever tonight here. We had come for my mom's birthday; she wanted to take the whole family here because she usually comes for lunch and said it was one of her favourite restaurants in the city. I could already tell when they were seating us that we were pegged as people who don't matter since a family of four didn't match their "scene." The food took nearly an hour and a half to get to our table and when we asked why, the waiter fed us some excuse that the kitchen didn't have enough room on the grills for our food. I would assume that a restaurant of that size would have enough room on a grill for more than one meal at a time. Most likely, if they had to choose which table got their food first between us and a "hipper" table, they would go with the latter. Already frustrated, we ate quickly, skipped dessert and asked for the bill. It took us another twenty minutes to pay. You would think after the experience, they would take our credit card as soon as possible. The waiter's answer for that one was that it wasn't his job...
Finally, on a side note, valet parking involves getting us our car: not greedily taking our money and pointing us in the direction of the car parked down the road.
It's too bad that my mom's favourite restaurant is one she will not be returning to anymore.
