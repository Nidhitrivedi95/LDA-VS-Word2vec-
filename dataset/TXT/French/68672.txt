VmSkQsAjUtzJeliKeGQCOQ I've only had breakfast there (about 4 times) but holy moly what an incredible deal for weekday breakfasts until 11am. 3.99 and they are classy, interesting, tasty, best home fries, good selection on the breakfast menu with a bit of nice salad and fruit.  Plus Donna, the server most often there in the morning when we went is just wonderful, funny, smart, accommodating and efficient.  Highly highly recommend. Oh, and good coffee too.
