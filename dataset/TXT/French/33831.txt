hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA The Baguette Cafe is simply the BEST local place in all of the valley...heck, in all of Nevada. Olivier absolutely LOVES what he does and not only can you see that on his face, it comes through in the food! The food here is simply the best thing you will put in your mouth all week! Get down here ASAP and tell them short little Lori sent you!
