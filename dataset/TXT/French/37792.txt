jaSowNITPRRCYpPb3_pjdA I have had two meals here and on both occasions encountered some critical missteps....bland mussels, soggy frizze, underdone poached egg, duck confit tasted like it had been reheated, charcuterie did not include any cured meats...just sausage and terrine with the cheeses.  Drinks are good...ambiance is nice...they just need to get that kitchen on point.

Ok I got food poisoning the next day...had to be the duck...it tasted old and was lukewarm.
