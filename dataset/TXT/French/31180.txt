ggIWkJtgXHKnhdxRu338AQ To be fair, I am not a huge French Cuisine fan, and my friend brought me to this restaurant.  So for somebody who is not a huge French Cuisine fan, this restaurant was pretty good. For apps, my friend had the steak tartar (which was a large portion!) and I had the smoked duck salad.  For mains my friend had the lamb shank and I had the rabbit.   I had never had rabbit before so I thought I would give it a try it, and it was good.  I have had a bunch of friends tell me how awesome rabbit tastes, but I found that it was just okay, nothing mind blowing.  But overall, everything tasted very good and the service was absolutely impeccable.  That was one thing that really stuck out.  From the person that opened the door, the man that took my jacket, the server, everybody was absolutely genuinely nice, happy, and made the experience of the restaurant memorable.  I increased my rating from 4 stars from 3 because it's not the restaurant's fault that I am not a French food fan, and the service was really absolutely awesome.
