QeEQXdto_4wFRaNKyIygRA I do miss working downtown since this is a nice spot to get some after work beverages (or 10).  Very laid back, no frills atmosphere to this place with an eclectic menu so I am sure there is something everyone can find to eat here.  Location, helpful staff, and tasty food/drinks makes me give this place a solid 3 stars.
