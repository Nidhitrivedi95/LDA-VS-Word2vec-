cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg We went here because it was close and listed as being Canadian. Here at Yelp it is listed as French so I assume it is French with a Canadian accent.
It is all impossibly delicious! I like how people I communicate with on Yelp from NY and NJ go to the same places I go in other cities and countries.
We had all Duck entrees and apps. It is very filling and very rich! Anthony Bourdain recommends it so I knew it had to be good. Anthony Bourdain gained my respect only after he went to Hawaii. It was only  then that  I knew he knew food. (the Hawaii show of Anthony Bourdain is on the Travel Channel right now.) 
Meats are roasted to the point of falling off the bone in the brick oven.  chef Martin Picard gets  creative with one menu item that is the most abundant menu item : foie gras. It comes in 10 combination's, including as a tart, with poutine, and in a quirky  creation called Duck in a Can which does come in a can  (see picture) , it comes to the table with a can opener. All of the food is rich and unique. If you are in Montreal you must eat here, period! 5 stars for being unique!
