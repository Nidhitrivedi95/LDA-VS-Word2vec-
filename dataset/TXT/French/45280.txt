mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q I recently visited this restaurant with my husband and another couple. I will first off say that the food was great. We were able to try many dishes and each one was delicious (though some maybe a bit on the heavy side). My personal favorite was the lobster pasta on the small plates menu- it was creamy and delicious, the lobster was cooked just right- everything you could ask for.

While the food was again, great, we were disappointed in the service- more specifically the fact that the menu was not adequately explained to us. Maybe it's our faults for not being up to snuff when it comes to high class dining (though we didn't have any issues understanding our meal at Alinea in Chicago), or perhaps it's our lack of French speaking skills, but when we told the server it was our first time dining at the place, I would have expected him to explain to me how the menu works, especially when it comes to portions and price. By the end of the meal, we each had been served WAY too much food than what one person could possibly consume- and this is coming from people who can eat! We were so full, no one touched their dessert, which we still paid for. Another let down- when we got the bill and find out that most of what we ordered was an up-charge, though we did not feel that was explained to us when ordering one of their "prix-fix" menus. Again...maybe other people understood all this when they dined here, but we, unfortunately did not and ended up paying for it both in our waistbands and in cash. If you're looking to enjoy some good food, I would still recommend this place, I just wish I had known the above mentioned points before dining myself.
