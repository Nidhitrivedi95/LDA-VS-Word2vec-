-4TMQnQJW1yd6NqGRDvAeA This restaurant is busy and came recommended. The decor was chandeliers, mirrors, old wallpaper... To look like an old home/cottage, but we get in and house music is blasting like its a night club. The hostess said it's because patio is busy so the music is to ensure patio is happy???? OK. Confusing. Then the menu.Very difficult to read because it was sooooo dark. Menu wasn't great, limited.  We put in an appetizer order to which the seemingly annoyed waitress said "the kitchen likes the whole order at same time so they can time it..." What?! Then we ask some questions about some entree descriptions and waitress again seemed  annoyed  as she told us she'd give us some time and walked away... No offer of help, no recommendations, nothing. The lobster bisque (which I live for!) Was so gross- bitter and tasted like a spoonful of burnt sherry. The amuse busch was flavorless and the chicken meatball over gnocchi was terrible. It was so bad and unpleasant we quickly canceled the firing of the steaks as we decided to leave - I've never done that before. The manager was very nice. Asked us to give the place another chance and charged $0.  Unfortunately he was the only good experience of The House.
