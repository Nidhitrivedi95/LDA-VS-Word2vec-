lQ9VmIWvM6v-rONPkYX8aQ My husband and I really enjoyed our meal at Alex this past weekend.  First off, let's just say that we're usually not huge Las Vegas cuisine fans because it's often expensive celebrity chefs with diluted service and food quality...we've been to MANY top notch restaurants in vegas but found that they paled in comparison to their original counterparts (take note Michael Mina).  Anyway, Alex was one of the best meals we've tasted so far in Sin City.  The food was inventive, but didn't try hard to be so.  And they had superb service.  We had originally sat down at Wynn's Bartolotta, but was drinkless 30 minutes after we sat down (what???).  So we left Bartolotta and opted to dine with Alex.  The best decision of the night.  The staff went out of their way to make the experience special, even packed specially made desserts for us so that we could make our show on time.  

While it's not cheap, the food and service was worth the splurge.
