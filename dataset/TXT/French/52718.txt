qbC4cfz-ShxEGpLS94Mk7Q One wants to like Tati for being a French bistro in a great location but the food and the service make that hard.

Having been several times, there is a noticeable difference between the size and quality of the courses served as part of the prix fixe menu and those ordered off the a la carte menu: experience has taught me that you can either go for a great deal and really kind of awful food, or a more expensive meal that, while not awful, is just kind of OK.

The beet salad is good as a starter, as are the mussels. But it is the entrees that truly disappoint. The cassoulet is some of the worst I've ever eaten: salty and flavourless, served so hot it was almost certainly microwaved. Past experiences with the trout and the lamb shank left me unimpressed. Given the quality of the cooked food, much as I love steak tartare, I'm not brave enough to try it at Tati.

Great ambiance, regrettable service, and food that, if you're a foodie, you can easily do better cooking at home.
