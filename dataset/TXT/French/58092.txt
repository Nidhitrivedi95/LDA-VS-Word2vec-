rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A This is for Bouchon restaurant not the bakery:
Wonderful place for brunch and dinner. 
Look at my pictures for reference!

I have yet to try their chicken and waffles (must try next), but everything I have ordered, did not disappoint. Staff is very friendly and customer service deserves two thumbs up.

Standard pricing for Vegas restaurants. 
I recommend making a reservation through open table beforehand vs. showing up. I hear how people wait over an hour for a table and that is just no bueno!

Romantic and intimate ambiance, plus for large groups, they have a private room which was really nice to dine in.
