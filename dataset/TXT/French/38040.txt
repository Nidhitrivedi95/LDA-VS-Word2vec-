Seriously though, why do all French restaurants in Toronto try to be all hoity toity? Sure, the food at La Banane is alright, but definitely not worth the price and definitely does not represent true French cuisine.  

Don't be fooled by the BlogTo articles and all the social hype. Just because the interior of the venue is incredibly beautiful, doesn't mean that the food is exceptionally delicious. Just because the restaurant is on Ossington street, doesn't mean the restaurant is "cool".  

If you're looking for a real French restaurant with true French cuisine, I suggest Le Paradis (close to Dupont and Avenue Rd) which offers a way more authentic experience.
