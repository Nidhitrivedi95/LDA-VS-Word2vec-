Had the bone marrow, which is great, and a cod appetizer off their specials, which was okay.  Steak for entree was wonderful, husband got the scallops off the specials, which were great as well.  Our server was excellent, full of information and suggestions.  

Dessert was the tarte tatin -- warm with ice cream -- yum.  I had the dark chocolate torte, which is intense but also very flavorful.

I really like the atmosphere, the bar when you walk in, the cute bistro-type tables and chairs, and the way people are crammed in there gives it a cozy feeling.

The people next to us had their small child (5 yrs), and he looked both bored with his food and the location -- not sure if it is a good place for children.  It can also be tight on space for strollers, but I think they are accomodating.
