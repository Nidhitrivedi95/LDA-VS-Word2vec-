FRuuIDOd21pTJHvEGIt1Gg Steak on a Sunday! Took our reservations and upon arrival we were seated promptly. Great appetizers, and we both ordered a steak each. Unfortunately they were overcooked, and the floor manager came over and apologized profusely, agreeing with the fact and didn't charge us for the meal. Based on the fact that I had been there in previous years and always had great food and service, I'll easily go back!
