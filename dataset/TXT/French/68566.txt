vLkKorA1gPS97Zj0_WKA0Q Terrible value for the money, i.e. overpriced.  Wine list is unimaginative and small.  Slow service.  Temperature was way too cold (one couple we saw had to be relocated to a different part of the restaurant because of the temp).  The food was however tasty (until they almost poisoned me... -- see below)

Additionally, in spite of my warnings and questions, they fed me food that gave me a severe anaphalactic reaction.  That would have been catastrophic if I had been with business associates.

I am sure the chef is a good cook however there are a lot of management issues both in front and in the kitchen that are not justifiable in any place that serves people food much less at this price.

Be forewarned...

For the money (and the risk) there are tons of better options in Vegas
