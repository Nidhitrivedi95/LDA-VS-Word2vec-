yVNaMEBUslR_7GbFhurJEg This lovely space makes a wonderful first impression: from the location, the outdoor terasse, and the decor, to the warm and efficient wait staff. It's on the pricey side, but well worth the visit. I inhale the bread and brioche but the doughnuts are the thing. I had been tempted to try these gorgeous things from the pictures with reviewers' posts and they are in fact un régal. Soft and sweet-coated with "cocaine", they are accompanied by five little white pots filled with orange purée, Nutella, dulce de leche, peach jam and bitter orange. The best by far is the orange purée. Our waitress, Marie-Andrée, explains that the oranges are pressed through a sieve to produce an unctuous, creamy marmalade. My sister and I finish the orange purée and I ask for a second. I should stop eating but I won't and breakfast arrives anyway. The simple white plates are perfect to showcase my sister's vegetarian omelet and my decidedly non-vegetarian veal sweetbreads with ricotta gnudi (think gnocchi but with the cheese). Both are excellent : the sweetbreads are particularly well prepared, with that flaky, crispy, light coating and the melting quality of the sweetbreads as my teeth sink in.

I have that after-food glow: that euphoric sense of satiation and as always a sense of sweet sadness knowing that this meal has ended but that I have mouthed every scent, taste, touch, sight and sound I possibly could.
