Tl2nqtPXlLbAG3qkUYVM2g If you are looking for a delicious meal with impeccable service then this is the place for you! My wife and I love this place and have frequented Vincent's many times. It never disappoints. Our most recent visit was this past Saturday night with close friends....The scallops appetizer was delicious: Roast rack of lamb was delicious and presented elegantly; Veal medallions were cooked to perfection with an outstanding sauce.....For dessert we had the Jack Daniels pecan pie and the strawberry tart- two delicious finales to our meal! All in all, first class....
PS- The only criticism of the night was the Lobster bisque which was just ok and lacked sufficient flavor for me....However, there are so many other choices from the menu you won't go hungry....
