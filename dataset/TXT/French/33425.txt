hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA Hubby and I went on a Friday morning at about 10:30am. There were a few tables outside and inside taken and no line in front of us to order.
Oliver introduced himself and was super nice explaining the menu and the specials of the day.

He had me at vegan carrot and coconut hot soup......a ordered a cup as soon as he explained it and YUM it was good. Sooo good I was dipping my sandwich in it.
I ordered a vegan sandwich on a ciabatta bread it had roasted vegetables, hummus, greens, eggplant and avocado. But the super shining star on the sandwich was WALNUT PESTO. I don't know how they made said pesto and I don't even really like walnuts but WOW I need more. 
I don't fool around when it comes to coffee. I like it black and preferably bathtub sized. Well, Oliver has that...22oz of fresh hot burn your mouth off ILLY coffee. As some people have described it a "bowl" of coffee. He did offer that they have soy, coconut, or almond milk if you wanted it. How nice?!

Hubby got the breakfast special which was a croissant with egg whites and I think it had tomatoes on it also. It's comes with a standard size coffee and a cup of orange juice. It looked beautiful and he said it was super yummy!!! I think all three were $5-6? I can't remember, but I remember thinking it was very good value.

Keep in mind. THIS IS NOT FAST FOOD. It started to get busy as we sat down to our table but I'm guessing it took about 30-35 minutes to get our food. I don't care. I watched how carefully this lady crafted our items. Two thumbs up. My sandwich was very filling and hubby gladly ate every last bite. He even "dipped" because I made him ;) he loved it.

I wish every restaurant took pride in their food!
