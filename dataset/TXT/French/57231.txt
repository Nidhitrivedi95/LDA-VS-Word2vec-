rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Walked in for Sunday brunch and we were seated in 15 minutes.  There was a really rude couple ahead of us that was being obnoxious, and yet the staff still seemed to treat them well.
We ordered: 1) the Croque Madame, which was to die for 2)Tuna Tartine, delicious, and 3)Ratatouille, fantastic!  We also ordered Salmon Rilletes, which was fabulous as well.  Even the plain table bread that comes with the butter and spread was just delicious.
So the food was great, but it did take a little while to come out of the kitchen.  The server kept checking on us, making sure our drinks were full and our bread kept coming.  Before we even mentioned it, the manager came over and apologized for the wait on the order and comped us some drinks.  I have zero complaints about the service, as our server was charming, friendly and kept us in the loop with regard to our order.  Not his fault the kitchen was backlogged/busy.  5 Stars for both service and the food!
