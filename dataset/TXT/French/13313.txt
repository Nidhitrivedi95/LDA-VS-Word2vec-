4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Maybe it was what I ordered but I just didnt really enjoy anything about the place. 
First we want outdoor seating so we get an hour wait, an hour goes by they encouraged us to wander off and come back, which we did. When we get back the staff lets us know that the wait had been less time than expected so we have to wait a bit longer. 
Once we get seated outside we ordered their pate, soup, and salad, with a french martini, and a Beaujolais red. All of it was just ok. For the price we paid I was expecting something a little more memorable but it was all just meh. 
I would rather save the money and go elsewhere in all honesty.
