aervNtqzrKf0CGrFo4xfKw I do not know what these people who are complaining about are talking about. We had a wonderful dinner here. The place, while in kind of a random location - is just beatiful inside, a perfectly warm, cozy place for a January evening. The food was also fantastic, while a little pricer than we usually spend, it was great value for the money. We shared the Bleu salad and the scallop appetizer with maple and bacon (which was amazing!). My boyfriend had the special almond crusted sole and I had the rack of lamb. We were both extremely happy with our food, including the garlic mashed potatoes and delicious sides (grilled fennel!) For des sert we shared a creme brule - very delicious and creamy.

I would highly recommend this restaurant - including one glass of wine and one soda it came to $95 plus tip - very reasonable for the quality and amount of food.
