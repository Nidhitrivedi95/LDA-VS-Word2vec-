rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw So French and so cute. I loved the Nutella sticky buns and the service was absolutely exceptional. Steak and eggs was great, lobster Benedict was great, French toast was a sight to see and was like a bread pudding--so good!  Would pass on the charcuterie (salami was oily and not fresh...) everything else was great
