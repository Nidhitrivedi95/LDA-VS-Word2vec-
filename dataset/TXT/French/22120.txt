BSmqxPbQglQwP2R56OqOag Really love this restaurant each time more.  Thank goodness it's in the neighborhood. Wine list is fabulous too.   I didn't "love" my choice today for dinner but it's a solid appetizer. I just wasn't paying attention it had chorizo in it and I didn't feel like that with my shrimp.  However for the description I believe it was excellent.  Service was fabulous and very welcoming group of staff. Definitely try it out.
