4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Love this place!  I've eaten there both times I visited Vegas. I ate lunch there two times and breakfast once.  Never had the pleasure of dining there for dinner.  Wish I had so I could give this place the full five-star rating it probably deserves.  They have a wonderful array of fine wines and the food is beautifully presented as well as delicious.  I had the savory crepes (shrimp and scallops), which was so good I just had to order it again the next time I had lunch there. Ordered Eggs Benedict for breakfast this trip and enjoyed it immensely.  If you take my advice and eat at this restaurant, make sure you get a window view or sit outside to take advantage of Bellagio's most spectacular water show.  It will surely add to your experience.
