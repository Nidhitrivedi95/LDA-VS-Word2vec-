P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ Instead of rehashing some of what the other reviewers have said, I will say that my sentiments are in line with most of what Loves G. stated in her review. I did not think the Asian sommelier was pretentious, though he was a bit formal and not as relaxed as some of the other servers. I mean, we were joking around with the servers all night (especially the one with the impressive bread cart) and Asian sommelier guy never cracked a smile, haha. I really liked that the ambiance wasn't stuffy. We felt very relaxed in this high-end restaurant. 

I really was not a fan of the interior decor. It is minimalistic, but it almost feels like your'e dining in a bank vault. The decor felt sterile and cold.

Truth be told, in spite of a few negatives, my husband and I felt that this was one of the most enjoyable meals we've ever had. I would consider coming back for the food alone (apart from the service, ambiance, etc.).
