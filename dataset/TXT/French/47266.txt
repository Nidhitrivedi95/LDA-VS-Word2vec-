O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q My initial instinct was surprise at a 3.5 star rating for Morels.  What?  And although I have a hard time identifying reasons as to why Morels is super awesome, it sits well in my memory.  I've tried 50% of the menu by now, and in total I have to say that it's good dining.  The couple of items I didn't like were the salmon flatbread and the thick toast (too thick) under the eggs benedict.  They have a lovely selection of shellfish and cheeses! And the bread and butter is good.  And there's a very good olive tapenade.  I could just eat bite after bite of those...
