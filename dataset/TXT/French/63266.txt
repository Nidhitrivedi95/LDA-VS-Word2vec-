SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA I really like L'Albatros....I think this is something that Cleveland was missing, a good semi-casual French Bistro.  Been there twice now and tried the steak frites, which was good, steak was cooked well, and fries were good, but not as thin as I like them.  Second time I did the Mussels and fries, and these were excellent.  Also if you go, you have to get a cheese selection from Brandon the fromagier......it was so worth it.   I will continue to go back.  The  first time we went our server was fabulous, she was very attentive and very nice, second time our waiter was a little slow.  We walked in without a reservation the first time (only 2) and the hostess was very accomadating, however the bar area is a little small if you did have a long wait.  Overall, I will be returning, cant wait for the summer, it looks like they have a great back patio!
