HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw This review is LONG overdue.  I've dined at this restaurant on four separate occasions now and it's my go-to french bistro (not that there are that many choices in town).   For provencal french comfort food, this is the place to go.

First time we came here, we were on a travelzoo coupon -- back when the Cosmo was having financial problems.  3 courses - had a nice spread between the wife and I - bone marrow (on the side), heirloom tomato salad, duck confit, burger, two desserts, and the very first time I had their bouillabaisse.  Both of us fell in love with the food and service at this place.

So the next time we brought some friends.  Had a spread of fresh oysters, fresh fish, a couple of meat products (bone marrow!), and of course, the bouillabaisse (you will see this recurring theme).

Third time, I decided to try something else, so I ordered the plat du jour (and got best parts of the pig).  As good as it was to have bacon served in a few ways, I felt that I had mis-ordered, as I was craving the bouillabaisse.  There is something magical about that seafood stew that brings a nice comforting feeling to my stomach, nice and fuzzy. :)

Yes, it's a little pricey for the things on the menu, but stick to the seafood entrees and it turns out about the same as most other restaurants.  Staff is always friendly and knowledgeable about the food, and very prompt with drinks and bread.

The only bad part about the place is that it's inside the Cosmo - I really wish the parking and vehicle routing at that place was better...
