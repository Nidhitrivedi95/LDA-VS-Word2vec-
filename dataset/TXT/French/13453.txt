4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Many happy Yelp reviewers seem to have come here for breakfast or lunch. We went for dinner, so I can't speak to those reviews. We also came here in part, frankly, because it's given 4 stars on Yelp, yet the prices are a bit more moderate than at many of the fancy places (steak houses, etc.) on the Strip. We liked the atmosphere and lighting inside, and also the service. The location at Paris is very good too, with many people enjoying the views from their outside tables. However, the food at dinner time was nothing special or memorable. I have been to another Mon Ami Gabi location, and recall having had a better dinner there. There's obviously lots of food variety in Vegas, and next time we'll try a different place for dinner. Perhaps we would come here & sit outside, however, for breakfast or coffee/snack.
