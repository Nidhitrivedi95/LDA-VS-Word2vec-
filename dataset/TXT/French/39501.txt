jT-KFrbwr5iE-_vrVLpmiw I called in to place my order on the phone about half hour before pick up (food for about 6 people at the office). The lady on the phone was very pleasant. I arrived a few minutes before I said I would. The whole process from start to finish was completely seamless. I had made a small change on my salad from goat cheese to feta cheese and feared that when I got back it might have not been done. It was!

When I got back to the office - i was so happy to see little labels on everything and they didnt miss a single thing. From start to finish I had a really good experience.  I work on yorkland blvd and we cater alot in our office. I loved how easy they made everything and everyone was so happy with how the food tasted.

I would go again and highly recommend it!
