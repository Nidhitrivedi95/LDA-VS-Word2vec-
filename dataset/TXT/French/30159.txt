FRuuIDOd21pTJHvEGIt1Gg This was my second experience here.  The first was a Saturday night dinner in March 2012.  I can't remember much detail but it was good enough that we came back to it again a few days ago for brunch.

Canada's 18% tax on food kills me every time but I guess the slightly stronger USD cancels that out.  I say this because the brunch for three people before tip came out to $96 CAD, which seems like a lot for brunch, but we did get two desserts and cappuccinos all around so maybe not.  

Price aside, the meal was excellent.  I had the duck confit and it was nice and salty as it should be.  It came with finger potatoes and arugula.  It's nearing lunchtime here and just thinking about it made my mouth water.  The vanilla creme brulee was on point.  The marzapan-type thing was good, too.  The waiters are very attentive and friendly, the place is well-lit and comfortable.  (Also while I was in the bathroom I heard the cooks yell, "Yes, chef!" in unison which I took as a good sign that they care deeply about what they serve.)

This place is in Old Montreal, which you know, has a lot of charm.  If you don't mind opening the wallet a little bit, you should eat here while in the area.
