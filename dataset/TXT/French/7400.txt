4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Third timer here and this is not the best experience I had. I went there with my two girls for dinner. Mind you that they are well-travelled kids and been to Paris (and the real Eiffel Tower). We were going to be seated outside (strike one!) when I told the receptionist that I specifically requested the main dining (my kids hate the heat) so she moved us to a table near the door (still warm). By then, I was already annoyed. Our server came and asked if we were ready - um - we just got seated - can you give us a moment? He came back, we ordered and when I said I wanted the goat and kale salad, he said: "that's it?" (strike two). Deep breaths!!! I was really disappointed by the service. My youngest was saying thank you in French and was being ignored. Guess who lost out on some good tip?
