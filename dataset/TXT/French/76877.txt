ysJo5Jdo29XOBCnKrbUKWg Such high hopes, but alas. The look and feel of the place are absolutely charming and bistro-authentic. Appetizers (tartar and dried meats) were adequate at best and fish entrees mixed (one served ice cold). Forty-five minutes between courses,for Pete's sake! Admittedly this was Saturday night, but it did not help to see the fellow who introduced himself as the general manager incessantly texting. Al fresco deck is lovely but the interior was super-hot, to the point that cooks could be overheard complaining. With time they may get this right but a ways to go before fulfilling very promising potential.
