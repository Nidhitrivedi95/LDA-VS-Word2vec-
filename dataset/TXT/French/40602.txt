We ate inside due to the heat, but I could see how nice the patio could be in cooler weather.  My husband enjoyed walking through the wines to select a bottle for dinner, which was reasonably priced.  We had the truffled goat cheese napoleon for an appetizer, and I'm surprised neither of us licked the plate clean!  I had the steak frites for dinner, which was cooked perfectly with a little chimichurri sauce on top.  The atmosphere was relaxing and the service was impeccable.  Vincent did a great job serving us and the manager stopped a handful of times to check in.  We'll definitely return on future visits to Las Vegas!
