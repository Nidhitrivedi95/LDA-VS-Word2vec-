4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Went there about a year ago, expecting French cuisine. It is not only extremely loud and hard to find seats, the service is also disappointing. A waiter spilled water and not only didn't apologize but also didnt clean it up. It's overpriced and the food is not that great. A French bistro would be not only a lot cheaper but also better!
