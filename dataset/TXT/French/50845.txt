oZHbPhIj01_31jqD053a_Q This is a pretty good restaurant, but I disagree with all the raving reviews.  I see the words creative, refined and sofisticated coming from my fellow reviewers.  I disagree.  I had the prix fix menu and I can't say I was impressed with any of the 8 or 9 dishes.  They are all good.  Just good.  I just spent the week eating at places like l'Epicier, Milos and Au Pied du Cuchon and this place just couldn't comparre.  I was bored. The service was not very good at all.  I mean, it wasn't bad, but the attitude was just not right.  If I'm paying $300 for dinner, I don't need a waitress who's snobby.  I was ordering 18 year Yamazaki and every time she brought one out, it was smaller than the last.  I mean, 2 sips maybe.  I've never gone anywhere where they serve such embarrassing drink portions.  Man, raise the price and serve a decent amount.  I didn't want to complain so finally I just said, "do me a favor, please take this back and tell the bartender to serve me a double because I'm not used to seeing a glass served with such little alcohol." This girl tells me, no, drink that and then I'll get you anotherone.  Are you kidding me?  This was just one of the things.  She had an attitude and frankly, I go pay big money to dine at these kinds of restaurants because I want to be treated like a king while I dine like a king.  

As for the food, each dish was ok.  I did not think they were imaginative at all.  Like I said, absolutely nothing memorable.  Nothing I haven't had before.  When comparing it to the other restaurants we dined at in Montreal, I would say that this was easily the worst one.  The ambience was nice and the presentation was very good, but it just came up short in the service and food, which is why I go to a place like this in the first place.
