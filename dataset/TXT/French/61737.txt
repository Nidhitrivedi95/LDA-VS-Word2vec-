sphMzEIqY1I2Dzv3zLZY2g We visited during Restaurant Week.  The service was great, and we enjoyed the menu.  The chilled corn bisque was awesome and I was craving a good corn on the cob when I finished it.  We also love the flavor of the pork tomahawk chop with braised kale and pineapple rum salsa.  The kale had incredible flavor and the whole dish was cook perfectly.  Will definitely return.
