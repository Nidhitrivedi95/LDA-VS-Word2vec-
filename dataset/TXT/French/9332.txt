4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw My bf and I looked last minute for a late night french restaurant on the Strip, so Mon Ami Gabi was the one we chose based on the high ratings. 
Firstly, I was disappointed to see the limited menu but decided on the salmon salad, and my bf picked one of the steak entrees. Our food was brought to the table in 15 minutes. This was shocking considering it was a busy Friday night. My salad was subpar. My bf's steak was bland and well done, not medium like he ordered. In addition to that the waiter saw my boyfriend's napkin on the floor and just picked it up and put it on his lap instead of giving him a replacement. 
After a few bites of the steak my bf asked the server for a new york strip steak instead. Again the steak came out shortly after his request, and it was charred black all over! My bf was really upset and told the server there was no way he was going to eat his food and just wanted the bill. At this point the server seemed semi apologetic and said he would send the manager to address the matter. The manager came over and apologized and offered free dessert. We declined. The server came back saying that the manager wan't going to charge us for anything and hoped we would come again. Ha, fat chance!
One star is being given because we were seated with a great view of the bellagio fountains.
