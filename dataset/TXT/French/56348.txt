rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A You know Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles is onto something when people from SD are willing to drive up to LA just for their chicken and Waffles.  Bouchon has taken this mix of breakfast and un-breakfast dish and brought it to a whole new level.  

The menu says: 
Roasted chicken, bacon and chive waffle,
Tahitian vanilla bean butter, sauce chasseur

My stomach says, "More please!"  

The waffles have a very very light batter, almost too light.  As you cut into them with your fork they have a distinct crunch as you break the crispy outer edge and continue into the light and fluffy interior that has been peppered with bacon and chives.  It is what normally is a sweet dish and made it savory.  The blend of saltiness and sweet speaks to your tongue in harmony as you lightly dip it into the warm maple syrup served on the side.  I didn't care for the vanilla bean butter but I also couldn't taste the vanilla bean, it was more-so just butter.  

The Chicken was wonderful.  The white meat was a boneless breast cooked to perfection so when you cut into it, the skin crunches and the juices ooze out.  The sauce it came with was nothing to write about except the large bacon chunks in it.  

The only minor complaint would be the price tag.  At $25 it's a little steep but hey, quality over quantity.  It's still definitely worth it.
