htQgj-ANQpZGpIpkkrEmyQ Best burger in Markham? I don't think so. I had the INSP burger and found it to be extremely heavy. I mean it was good for the first few bites, but afterwards eating got really messy as it was soaked in fatty oils. The fries were also extremely oily. Would go back to try the carbonara though.
