rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w Le Cirque has all the makings of a great restaurant:

-Location overlooking the Bellagio fountains
-Creative, young chef and tasty food

Unfortunately, our server was a caricature of the pretentious, snooty waiter that you love to hate in movies. It's an old school approach to service, where arrogance is part of the "experience." Thanks but no thanks, I'll pay more and get great, friendly service at French Laundry and Meadowood. 

We ordered:
$72/per person (Pre-theater menu)

Hamachi - the yellowtail was fresh and tasted great with the honey and yuzu reduction

Prime Hanger Steak - tender and cooked at the right temperature. It was slightly bland for my taste buds but good overall

Raspberry Parfait - good presentation and a light, refreshing end to the meal

The location and decor makes Le Cirque a very appealing good place to visit. With that said, I am checking this off the list and hope that other patrons have a better overall experience.
