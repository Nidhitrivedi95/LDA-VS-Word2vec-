We ordered the burger with rice (kind of like a tomato version of loco moco, i personally prefer the original dish, but to each their own), the beet salad (excellent fresh bite with citrus and mixed greens), the chicken kara'age? (THIS WAS DELICIOUS, SUPER FRESH AND PERFECTLY FRIED), the eggs, fries and toast breakfast (with fluffy eggs and delicious fries), the french toast (a little soft in texture, but amazing taste with fresh whipped cream), and the beef something dish (also delicious with tender beef and perfectly cooked rice). 

I would definitely come back here for more comfort style eats. They really have mastered the KeepItSuperSimple model, with their sparse decor and two page menu, it really is all about the food. 

The desserts looked amazing, we just didn't have the room...will have to come back for those!
