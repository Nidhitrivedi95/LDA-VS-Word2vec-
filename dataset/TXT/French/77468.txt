YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g LOVE this place! I've been wanting to try this place for so long and it definitely lived up to the hype. Beautiful and classy decor. Very attentive wait staff. And the food? Amazing!

Appetizers: We ordered the foie gras trio which came in three forms: seared, terrean (?) and cappuccino. That's right. Cappuccino. Wth right?? Surprisingly, pretty damn good! We also ordered the Truffled Onion Soup. OH MY GOSH. Delicious! Rich, smooth, flavorful, yummy! We also got some Sea Bass appetizer and that was just okay. It wasn't very memorable because frankly, I don't remember how to describe it.

Entrees: We ordered the Filet Mignon and Lobster. The Filet Mignon was hands down, the most tender and juicy steak I've EVER had. I was so blown away. I'm serious! The lobster was just as delicious but I was too busy focusing on my filet mignon to really eat the lobster.

Dessert: We ordered the chocolate souffle which was pretty delicious as well!

Overall, the service was so attentive, food was amazing, this place definitely lived up to the hype and I recommend this to anyone!
