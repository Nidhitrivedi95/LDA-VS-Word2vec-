xcmmTXhuMx2fZF2Bt69F4w I love this place.  I only wish that it wasn't so popular.  The only thing that keeps me from coming here more often (other than the fact that I have young children) is that it is small, and there is usually a wait by the time 5:30 pm rolls around.  

My wife and I went to Belgium a few years ago and enjoyed both the delicious fries and the walkaround waffles that they sell there.  Feeling particularly poor given the Euro-currency exchange rates, and given the cold weather (it was winter when we went), the fries in Belgium were a constant and cost effective and warm companion during our travel.

The Point has recreated these heavenly fries and mayo-aioli style dips perfectly and deliciously.

In addition their moules (mussels in white wine and cream sauce are also delicious).  

My wife likes their vegetarian appetizers etc. as well.  This is not  an inexpensive place, but it is very yummy.
