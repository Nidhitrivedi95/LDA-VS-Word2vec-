Yp1swb-8pO8i-6-jaK2tsA I am only giving them 3 stars because the service I received on Sat. was great our server was a pregnant girl (I don't remember her name) but she was very nice and accepted our coupons. The coupon clearly states that is one per check not one for the whole table and even our server from Sat. didn't make a big deal and was ok when we asked for 2 checks and gave her 2 coupons.

Anywayz.... I went 2 days ago during dinner and told the server we wanted 3 separate checks in the table and I showed him the coupons it was a $5 off the classic menu and 2 for the buy one dinner and get another free. It was 5 of us and so the waiter a bald guy (not sure of his name) said it was one for table and so we told him ok so would you validate it if some of us would sit in the table infront of us? after that he gave me such a long and useless explanation of how corporate and management had their rules and this was coming from them, bla, bla, bla!!! He asked if I wanted to speak with his manager but I didn't because I did not want to cause a scene so my sister asked me to leave it alone. 

When it was time to pay we only used 2 coupons for separate checks and the waiter gave me another long explanation about my coupon and how he was going to talk to his manager and I said "but I got my meal from the classic menu." 

When he returned he said that they were going to accept it this time and he continues saying "Im sure that it will be accepted next time too" 0_o ok???? What was the big deal?

Lastly, when he brought us back our receipts my sisters had a free dinner or breakfast entry but mine didn't. It was obvious why he did that but its ok because I get more coupons in the mail room ; )

I WILL NEVER RETURN HERE DURING THE WEEK FOR DINNER ONLY BREAKFAST DURING THE WEEKEND ; )
