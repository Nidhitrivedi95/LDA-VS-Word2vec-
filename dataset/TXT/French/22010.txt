bRmb81XDG3E2SOHARBLTog First things first: service is terrible here. My brother and mother took me here for my birthday last night and we ordered from the Winterlicious menu. 

The waiters are cold. One offered to level out our table and our orders were taken fast. However, the food took a while to arrive. I had the blue crab cakes (it was delicious), the baked chicken (ok- I can get much better chicken at Ruth's Chris and really should've gone there) and for dessert, the mango pudding and vanilla ice cream. Portion sizes were good and I must admit that I was mighty full after the meal.

Overall, I'd give the food a 4/5. HOWEVER, any tastiness in the food was overshadowed by the terrible service. My brother, mother and I finished our appetizers and main courses and we literally sat there for 10 minutes after each course with our empty dishes left in front of us. This is even though at least two waiters walked by and saw the empty dishes. 

Our water was refilled once (refilling being the mark of great service) and only because my brother asked the waiter for it. NO ONE came to ask how the food was- NOT EVEN ONCE. When it came time to pay, we were charged for 4 Winterlicious patrons when there were clearly only 3 of us and when my brother pointed this out, there was not even an apology.

I've patronized many restaurants that partake in the Winterlicious event over the years and this is the first time that I've had a bad experience and on my birthday no less. It's pretty idiotic of them as if i were a restaurant, I'd use the Winterlicious event to market to potential customers. Way to leave a bad impression on potential customers. Never returning to this place and taking my business and network of friends and colleagues elsewhere.
