Even so, it was worth the wait... As our hostess put it, the new location is like the old one on steroids!  

We toured and dined here on a spontaneous date night over the weekend.  We went for early bird dinner on Saturday; I guess that's what happens when you have young kids sometimes ;)  It's worth noting that we noticed two parties with young children dining while we were there.  It's not a place I would typically think to bring my kids, but they do accommodate, have highchairs, etc... I love the many rooms at the new location.  It was perfect for our intimate date night, but this would also be a fabulous place to go with a bunch of couples.  It's also worth noting that while I miss the BYOB option of the former location, CDT now offers a full selection of cocktails, beer and wine.  (You can BYOB if you join their Wine Club for $45 / year).

Nicole was our server and she was just the right amount of attentive and sweet.  So fashionable as well.   Jared and I shared the signature Roquefort Salad, 3 Onion Tarte, and Halibut entree. We each enjoyed a glass of wine as well.  The kitchen split the salad and entree for us for an additional charge, but also made sure portions were still generous with the sides.  I recommend allowing them to do this.  Everything we experienced was fresh and delicious, made with creative preparations of locally-sourced ingredients.

We were too full for dessert, so we'll have to return again soon for that... their brunch menu sounds fabulous too!
