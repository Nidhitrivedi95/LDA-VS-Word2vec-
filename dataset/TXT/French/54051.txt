qTacF-_Iucc1Nxom_Za_5Q We had a grand ol' time at this French bistro / cocktail bar...the drinks, atmosphere and food were all on point. We sat at the bar and greatly enjoyed the experience.

The following yummies were consumed:

French onion soup - very tasty...it was smaller and less overpowered by cheese/bread than onion soups tend to be. Sometimes an onion soup is like a meal in itself but this was nicely balanced.

Chicken liver & foie gras parfait - a fantastic pate that was even better on their homemade potato chips (which we ordered for $2 extra when we ran out of crostini)

Flat iron steak with mushrooms and cream sauce - something about the combination of steak with mushrooms/cream is just irresistibly good

Frites with aioili - hot and crispy...just excellent

All in all, this is a great addition to the Dupont strip!
