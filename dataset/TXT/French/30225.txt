FRuuIDOd21pTJHvEGIt1Gg Beautiful place for brunch with a French bistro feel, like Balthazar in NYC.  The servers are ethereally beautiful and the breakfast options are congruent with most brunch places.  They serve soft boiled eggs on egg cups which add a novel and nostalgic touch.  I had the Eggs Benny, which were textbook good and my boyfriend had eggs with bacon and he raved about how the bacon was wonderfully smoked.  He also had cafe au lait, which he enjoyed so much that he was contemplating ordering a few more but he had the temerity to stop himself.  All in all, it was a very nice and relaxing place to enjoy yourself and people-watch since there was a high number of very good-looking patrons while I was there.
