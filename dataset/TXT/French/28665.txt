eJ9L40jm5VOXCIq7xs9kQw Any place as nice as this that offers a three course pre fixe menu for $31 deserves 4 stars! Especially if they serve you the bison steak in that red wine sauce....Mmmmmm That steak alone would make me want to come back to place. It was so tender and juicy and just paired so so well with that red wine sauce. And it was perfectly cooked to the medium rare that I like too! 

And it is a good thing that the steak was so incredible, because the seafood linguini I got as my first dish was just okay. It was supposed to be in this saffron sauce but I think they must have forgotten the saffron, because it didn't taste like much and that is such a strong flavor normally! But at least the seafood itself in the pasta was pretty tasty. 

And the chocolate mouse....Wow. I love chocolate. I am close to being an addict I think since whenever I see a dessert menu anything with the word chocolate in it directly grasps my visual attention, so I couldn't pass up this option either! And I am really glad that I didn't! It was so light and rich at the same time and with that mint leaf it was the perfect way to end my meal!

The wine here is pricey though...But Montreal in general is pricey, so just be prepared to throw down a bit of money if you come here, but I promise the food is really good! Everyone else in our party loved their food as well! So bring money and don't be in a rush, since they also took a little bit of time getting to our food order heh
