L6RxkP8dneVGelDLUhjCug Came here for the first time and the ambiance of the store is pretty good. As soon as we saw the menu, we were a bit disappointed. There's not a lot of things to choose from. I get it, maybe because they just opened but the reviews were so great that my boyfriend and I wanted to try it out. My boyfriend got the spicy beef soup and I got the pho dac biet. I've tried out a lot of phos and this is not up to par compared to Pho kim long, Pho so 1 or Pho Saigon 8. With that being said, their pastries were pretty good. The macarons were made fresh and you can taste it. I asked for Thai Tea and they don't have it YET. The staff were really nice and they make you feel like home, unfortunately they just need to step up their pho/soup game cause if anything, they should stick to just being a bakery where they excel.
