YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g Some of the food items were outstanding, but others were not very good.  The sea bass was extremely salty and the ravioli were so thin, you could not taste what it was stuffed with.  The potatoes that came with the filet were dry and not very flavorful.  The truffle onion soup and filet mignon were excellent.  The service was just mediocre.  The servers were excellent and energetic, but the waitress did not match their energy.
