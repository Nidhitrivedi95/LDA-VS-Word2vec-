This is a a little restaurant on a beautiful, quaint pedestrian street, Rue Prince Arthur E (the E/east is really important!).  At the restaurant, the service was great - very friendly and welcoming, yet also unobtrusive.  

We started with the tomato basil goat cheese tart- holy schnarkies, it was unbelievable.  The pastry was so light it pratically floated off plate, yet each bite was also deliciously buttery. How? How does that happen together?! Don't know, but it did.  

Hubby a flank streak with pomme frites, I went skirt steak- not too exciting of us, I know.  But still, A Table made these simple selections delicious- both steaks were perfectly done and the french fries that could have been boring-weren't.  Afterwards, we strolled along the street towards Louis Square, which had really interesting architecture- all around great evening.  Highly recommend.
