gf46U12A1oIIpq2sNt_PGg Finest traditional French in Toronto. Chef Didier is classically trained. The upside: you get French food as envisioned by their creators. The downside: Didier will not compromise; if you don't want it his way, go elsewhere!
Had dinner last night and dine there regularly. The new menu is a welcome upgrade. 
I had the oeff cocottes to start, beef Rossini main course and soufflé. As usual a wonderful meal. Our party also ordered the loupe, and don't miss the boule de neige as another dessert option. An absolute party in your mouth!
With cocktails and wine it's not an inexpensive restaurant. However, if it's great, I mean the best, French food that you want, you'll be hard pressed to do better than Didier.
