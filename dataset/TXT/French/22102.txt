Carens is one of my new favourite spots in Yorkville!
Right across the street from the Cumberland theater, it's the perfect spot to grab a glass and dinner before a film.  They have a lovely upstairs area for dudes to liquor up their dates...er I mean converse with their lady.  It's also a fun place to catch up with the girls.
Reservations are recommended.  

The back patio is just gorgeous.
We were seated on wood benches by heat lamps.  
Dim lit, warm, and ambient, I loved the hanging Moroccan style lanterns.
Caren's is indeed a chick bar.  

As expected, the wine list was global and extensive, ranging in price from reasonable to stupid expensive.  Any wines served by the glass can be served as a half-litre!  I feel like I should just carry around a ginormous wine glass (You know, like Big Joe from Cougartown).

The fondue for two ($22) was simple but goopy delicious.  A variety of cheeses mixed with a bit of white wine and kirsh, the fondue was mild and well balanced.  The accompanying bread was a bit stale, but I pretended I didn't notice.  Smothered in melted cheese, it was still satisfying!

We ordered chorizo as a side, which ended up being an excellent choice.
The saltiness worked well with the cheese.

This place seems popular for groups or girly functions.  They have a few fixed price menus and hors d' oeuvre packages as well.

Even though I really enjoyed myself, the only downer was our server.
Our server was surprisingly horrible.  I don't think he should have been serving at a wine bar.  He was such a downer.  I should have asked him for a diet coke.
