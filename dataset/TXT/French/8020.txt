4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I had dinner here with my two girlfriends and were serendipitously given a table with a view of the Bellagio fountain show. Atmosphere was absolute perfection and very romantic. There is quite a bit of a wait (approx 20 mins) even with a reservation so it can be a bit frustrating at first. However, once you are seated, the staff is wonderfully efficient and serve you freshly baked French bread (very tasty) and butter with shredded carrot appetizer (on the house) before you can bat an eyelash. Our entrees were served to us within 5-10 minutes of ordering. Amazing! 

I ordered the Steak Au Poivre, which is with the black peppercorn sauce. It was cooked to a perfect medium and tasted delicious. Entrees typically come with a mound of thin French fries. We shared a bread pudding, which I cannot remember due to the overconsumption of Sangria that night. But I remember that it was tasty and served a la mode. My most salient memory of this place---they have STRONG sangrias. Order them if you want a nice glow during dinner. 

Overall, I really liked this little cafe. It's a bit different from my usual, which is just your average mom and pop hole-in-the-wall shop. But I found it to be nice without being overly pretentious. 

Tips: Make a reservation because this place is veryyy popular and packed with people on the weekend.
