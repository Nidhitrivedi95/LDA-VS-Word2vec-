S5gtq6g6dIfyaFvyPYyzkg Don't be scared when you see this imposing but gorgeous old Victorian building. Just smile, geet the man on front of the door and you get the chance to enter another world. Even once you win the fight against the old ladies, prams and tourist couples for a table, you can still be waiting ages for the staff to acknowledge you. Finally, now you're a little oder, it's time for a drink served with nuts! Gaze at the stuccoed walls, feel the colourful mosaic floor under your feet and appreciate the vast size of the room under the fascinating dome. Enjoy Parisian flair in the middle of Edinburgh!
