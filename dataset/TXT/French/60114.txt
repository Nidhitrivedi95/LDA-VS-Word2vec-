I have been looking forward to this dinner for a long time. Everything about the dinner has already been said in the other reviews, except that if you do not drink on a regular basis and you decide to get the alcoholic pairing you will leave dunk and might not remember some of the last dishes. It was the best meal of my life and one of the top for my honey also. $684.23 for two dinners and two wine pairings.
