My husband and I decided to splurge on one good dinner during our recent stay in Vegas.  It was hard narrowing it down with so many great choices but after reading several yelp reviews and recommendations from foodies, we made reservations at Le Cirque.  
The service here is impeccable.  Everyone made us feel so welcome in such a genuine way.  Our glasses were never empty and the waiters were good about picking up our empty plates when we both were done- as to not rush us as is the case when one person finishes and the waiters take their plate right away.  The sommelier was so nice to us when we wanted a bottle of wine to pair well with both of our dishes.  He did not snub us when we told him our price range or that we weren't too big of a wine drinkers.  He gave us great recommendations and we ended up with a nice Sauvignon Blanc that is now my husband's favorite wine.
The waiters seemed very genuine too- made lots of small talk asking where we were from and talking about good eats in Chicago.

We did the tasting menu and every dish was awesome.  Usually when you do a tasting, there's a few dishes that you could do without, but every dish was "lick your plate clean" worthy.  Husband and I usually trade plates half-way through the dish, and we both struggled to give up our plates but were glad when we did because the other plate was just as good.  I don't think I could even pick a favorite dish because every dish was great.  One that I was borderline about was the sea urchin ice cream.  The first 2 tastes were really good, but after awhile it was too rich.  Since i traded halfway, it was a good dish that wasn't overpowering.  My husband LOVED the foie gras and duck dishes.  

We would definitely visit Le Cirque again any time we're in vegas- might even check out the one in NYC next time we're there.  Best. Dining. Experience. Ever.
