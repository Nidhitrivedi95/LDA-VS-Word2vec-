gISrxk4A5dfrjDivkC-L-Q What a great dessert place - a solid 3.5 star.
The server told us everything they serve is from France. That wasn't a requirement but it was a good visit overall with small misses.

Food: 3/5, the Flan Parisienne (custard pie) was the best thing there. I should've stopped there because that would've guaranteed 4 star at least but I also tried the syrup which really was italian soda but super watered down and the chocolate-almond croissant that was just not good. I know my pastries and it shouldn't be that greasy that - it seemed a little stale to me.  Nevertheless, I will return to try others and get the flan again.

Service: 4/5, super nice lady and the server was great too.  They took time to explain things and it was just great overall.

Ambience: 3/5, a little tight seating and some bugs around; perhaps because of all the sweets.  They may want to close the doors.

Price: 3/5, around $12+ per person which is not too bad for higher end dessert joint.
