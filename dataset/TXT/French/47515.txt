O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q Had a wonderful experience here! Enjoyed brunch on the patio overlooking the Strip. 

Started off with a Bloody Mary that they made for me table side and just the way I like it...SPICY!

For my meal, I ordered the Smoked Salmon Flatbread...and let me tell you it was the most delish thing I have had in a long time. It was was so huge it was basically the size of the plate. I enjoyed this breakfast so much, I went back the next day just so I could order the same thing....YUMMY!
