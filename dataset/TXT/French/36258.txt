i2dnic7VdQ3NyiQQWUXHbA I went there for brunch with my girls squad. I admit, the fact that it was a rainy Friday morning might have influenced my mood. Still, the breakfast menu was very basic. I ordered a classic breakfast, two eggs, sausages etc. And my friends tried the blueberry pancakes and a kind of breakfast grilled cheese. Overall, it was okay. I don't think it's worth the price compared to other breakfast place. Plus, it's a really small restaurant. The service though was impeccable and I will nonetheless come back another time for dinner.
