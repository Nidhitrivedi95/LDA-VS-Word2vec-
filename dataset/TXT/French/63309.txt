SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA French restaurants are rare in the Cleveland area, so L'Albatros was a very pleasant surprise. The menu was short but offered variety with a generous handful of specials not on the menu. 

Their escargot in heavy butter sauce and spices was an interesting diversion from the standard butter+garlic venue. Quite rich in flavor. The shoulder of lamb with risotto was a surprise; the risotto was closer to acini di pepe (like the pasta used in Italian wedding soup) but I didn't complain -- it was still delicious.

They had a new Chianti wine (French region) that was incredible with the lamb.
