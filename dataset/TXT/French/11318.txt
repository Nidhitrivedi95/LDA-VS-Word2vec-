4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I think it's one of the few decent restaurants that offer natural lighting on the Strip. None of that indoor, dimly lit, and/or fake sky, non-reality business. Lovely ambiance for enjoying breakfast or brunch on a gorgeous Vegas morning.  The enclosed (indoor) patio is perfect for staying cool, while getting a decent view of the street and the Bellagio fountain/water show. 

I had the chicken, brie, apple crepe, and my bf had the corn beef hash that our friendly server recommended. I liked both dishes, but both tasted better when they were still warm/hot. The poached egg in my bf's dish was a bit over-cooked and the watercress was very bitter tasting, but perhaps not meant to be eaten by itself. 

I would recommend this restaurant.
