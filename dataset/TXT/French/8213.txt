4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw The restaurant was very dark but had a nice view of the strip. Probably a really nice place to eat on the patio during the summer. Decent view of the Bellagio fountain show, even though there are a bunch of big ass trees in the way!! That's all on Bellagio though... 

Got the hanger steak and it was really good. Escargo was decent as well. Service was ok and so were the prices. 

Go here for a classy, nice meal for an above average price.
