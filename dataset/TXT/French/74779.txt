xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g Didn't give it 5 stars only because I didn't have a full meal there and just got drinks and dessert at the bar. 

First of all, I expected this to be a cheesy Vegas tourist trap, which I was totally into doing on Thanksgiving day -- but when I arrived for lunch, the hostess informed me that they weren't opening until 2 p.m. dinner service. She recommended another spot for me to eat in the hotel but I told her, "Well, I wasn't really there for the food, more for the experience." So, she offered to bring me upstairs to have a look.

How gorgeous is this place! Incredible view of the strip and the Bellagio fountains. Beautifully designed and elegant -- really feels like you're "inside" the Eiffel Tower. The hostess took the time to show me the Thanksgiving menu and even checked to make sure they'd be serving their famous soufflés later. I promised to come back at least for a drink.

When I had a less-than-stellar Thanksgiving dinner elsewhere, I found myself returning to the Eiffel Tower and took a seat at the bar. The seasonal special soufflé, pumpkin, was TO DIE FOR. The soufflés take 45 minutes because they're freshly prepared, so if you know you want one, best to get that order in ASAP.

While I waited for it, I sipped on a 13-year rye recommended by my bartender (who let me have a little sip to be sure I'd like it) and took in the atmosphere. I was dining solo but at least two bartenders made sure I was taken care of and happy, and I never felt alone.
