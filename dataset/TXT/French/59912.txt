sARavfidmIS878q5BtlyVQ é is an absolutely delicious intimate dining experience that is extremely difficult to describe via written text. This place is pretty much world class in nearly all aspects of the culinary world. First off, it's extremely small and requires some significant up front reservations. Second, it has an extremely well thought out menu with about 23 courses of pure bliss. Third, the drinks, particularly the spins on gin and tonic were delicious and almost perfectly done. 
The dining experience is quite unique as it is a fixed menu with a ton of sweets, odd concoctions and perfectly balanced protein items. There was a mass amount of truffles utilized in a lot of the dishes and the  spices were balanced nicely to satisfy your palette. You could sense the application of culinary physics with the mixture of foams, candied items and creams perfectly prepared amidst foie gras and other exotic items. Overall, this place is absolutely recommended to those looking for fantastic service, a unique atmosphere and true culinary exploration.
