SFnrHuVFSNiondFVUBLJZQ I had a pretty great dining experience here. The service was nice; the only complaint I have about them is the fact that they decided to seat is downstairs next to the door when they had plenty of seating upstairs.

The food on the other hand was pretty good. I ordered the crepe, La Florentine, which was really simple but very tasty. It had spinach, Brie, and some creamy sauce that blew my mind. 

Their drinks, from which I chose some Kirs, were great.

Would recommend.
