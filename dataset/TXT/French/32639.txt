gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg We were a little bit obsessed with this place. We came here numerous times on our most recent trip to Mtl, and we had visited in previous years as well. The beer keeps us coming back, namely the seasonal raspberry wheat! A lovely refreshing beer for the summer. We came just my fiancé and I, and also with a group of friends a few times. We always enjoy the food, and we've tried quite a bit of the menu. Burgers, flatbread pizzas, mussels, calamari, onion rings, pretzels, poutine, etc! Everyone enjoyed it here. The service was mostly excellent, a few better than others of course. We miss this place already, there aren't many microbreweries at home in Newfoundland!
