q1MakkWbeUpS2IWQdxCVdA What a disgusting restaurant!! 4 people in our group ordered the Shepherd's Pie. 3 of the 4 were cold. The dish looks like canned dog food swimming in a pool of flavorless yellow crap. Besides the look, it tasted like what I expect dog food to taste like. One person in our group managed to send hers back and order something different, but unfortunately, once I realized that mine was cold and disgusting, no wait staff was to be found anywhere. Awful service with limited communication skills (it is Laval, after all, can't expect too much from them, I guess). If you're a white-framed sunglasses wearing, Ed Hardy t-shirt wearing, Moomba attending, 450 douchebag, by all means, try it, you may like it. But for those of us with at least basic knowledge of what food should be, stay away!!
