HiMb8cwGsnFVwYxt1h0RCg I had their brunch on a week-end, with the place bursting with people. They serve the usual breakfast fare, eggs, Benedicts, waffles, etc. The price is fair, given the ginormous portion of food served.

One hiccup during my visit; each of the plates came with a small bowl of fruits. That day, it was a mixture of melons, one of which clearly had gone bad. There were only a few bits of melon in each cup of fruit so by the time we realized and spit it out, we didn't have any left to show the kitchen.

The decor is fresh, modern, vibrant and green, and everything looks quite new.

I would come back if I was in need of a breakfast fix with friends, but this spot does not stand out from the crop of other similar priced and similar menu-ed brunch restaurants in Montreal.
