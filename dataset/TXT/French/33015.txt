H9pG0BNhqID2MTj8KnY3jQ Suk and I picked up guy don and karaange for take out.  The karaange is typically made with wheat flour but the chief made it with corn for us.  Although we grabbed take out, the service was lovely while we waited.   The ambiance was pleasant with a good sound track.   I did find it a bit bright though.  They have track lighting and it seems they should be able to dim the lights (hoping) because otherwise, it gives off a slight cafeteria feel, despite the good music. 

The 5 stars are well deserved for the food, which is amazing, as well as for their service and for their chief changing his normal recipe to accommodate our eating requirements.   I cannot wait to return and eat their entire menu
