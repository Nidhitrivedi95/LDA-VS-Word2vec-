LjOBNcNNpuewBqSPxYYTJQ This place does not have the same ambiance as the NoDa cafe.  All the same food though.  Amelie's has the best Chai Tea latte in city.  Salted Caramel brownies are delicious.  I have been several times with friends who ordered various pastries and gave them high marks.  Twice, I have had the chicken salad croissant and both times had an upset stomach after. So I am wondering if the mayo is left out too long?  I am sticking to lattes and pastry.  If you are looking for a quiet place to chat and linger over coffee, not sure this it.  It is VERY loud here and challenging to find a parking space.  I have been on Tues night and it is just as packed as Saturday morning.  It is one big room, not several unique rooms like the NoDa cafe. The decor does try to be similar and it is interesting.   You order at the register near the pastry counter, but there is a barista counter and they will call you when your order is ready.  A few others have made comments about the customer service.  I have probably been here 6 times, close to a place I have to be regularly, and I have found the staff friendly and helpful
