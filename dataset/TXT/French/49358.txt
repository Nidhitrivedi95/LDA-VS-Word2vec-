or4UVDjXEEjze3wNPjoAZA If I had never gone to this place for lunch this would probably be a four star review. Unfortunately, my last two experiences have been 2-star lunch time experiences. It's lunch, people! We don't have time to wait 45 minutes for our food! 

Both times the servers took their sweet time acknowledging that we'd been seated. Both times the food was ultra slow coming out (I actually thought the girl forgot to put the order in the first time this happened). A couple months ago I sent a drink back because there was a bug in the glass and the waitress actually rolled her eyes at me. This time even the food was mediocre - over-broiled onion soup and over-dressed salad that, despite the very fancy description, was just a Caesar salad. Oh, and they forgot to bring the drinks for half our party. 

My recommendation - go for dinner and stay far far away from lunch. The dinner menus is better and they usually have great specials. The wine list is worth checking out. And it seems they put their more experienced (or just their less apathetic) servers on the dinner shift.

Also a bright spot - the food runners and bus staff. More than once now they have offered to go get my server or check on my food. I feel bad, because they probably get tipped out off the crappy tips that people leave the wait staff.
