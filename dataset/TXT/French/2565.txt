0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g You know how you will have a meal, maybe one every 5 or 10 years, that you keep calling back to as a reference for all that is pure and good?  Prior to Picasso it was Victoria and Albert's in Orlando, or Azul at the Mandarin Oriental in Miami. Well, now Picasso is one. And I've been looking for the "Picasso" of every new city I've visited since. 

We had the tasting menu, which frankly started out strongest with poached oysters. Everything else was also amazing, but the oysters are the new comparison point. The ambience was divine and the wait staff was professional and approachable, with a healthy sense of humor. 

In a meal like this, I hope the details escape me. And they do, because I sat there giddy like a schoolgirl the whole time, hoping it wouldn't end. It ended, but I'll be back. In 5 or 10 years.
