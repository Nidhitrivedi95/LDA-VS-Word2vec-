First time here I had the Christmas Clem Salad Sandwich.  Grapes, capers, cranberries, Grider, charred sweet onion, mixed greens on a challah roll.  Upgraded to the fries.  Omg! It was wonderful- a great combination of flavours that honours the classic.  Home made dipping sauces- very, truffle ketchup, and aioli were wonderful!  Dining companion raved about the Salmon BLT.

So good ...  we came back today. Time to try out the slow cooked turkey and the ham and cheese croissant... 

The turkey was fantastic.  The sprouts, bacon, avocado - perfect. Love the tries with a hint of rosemary.  We both loved our sammies. Home run!
