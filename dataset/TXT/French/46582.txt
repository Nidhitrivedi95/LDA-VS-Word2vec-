nKeGPmH5dYNVL5AyAItuKg So much hype about this restaurant and of course I was drawn in. Finally went and it all definitely lived up to the hype. The service was fantastic, our server was very knowledgeable and kind, a complete natural. 

Love the atmosphere, dark and candle lit tables. Older kitchen set up out in the open that gave it a real homey hipster vibe.
 
We ordered almost everything on the menu and all dishes were impeccable, hard to believe right? I'm going to say that what these guys do with their food is a complete joy to your palate. The food is so innovative and everything was perfectly seasoned! Few of my favs:

1. The lettuce fish taco
2. The beet juice calamari
3. The spicy beef tartare 
4. Popcorn shrimp

Their drinks are great especially the grapefruit gin and tonic.
Also I asked for jameson neat and they didn't have but he had told me I would enjoy Jim Bean Black even though I don't like JB. He poured out half a shot for me to taste and it was actually smooth and tasty. 

Definitely need to go back, it was a great experience. Whoever reviewed this place 3 stars or under, don't know a thing about food or dining in Toronto...just go back to mc donalds!
