AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw We decided to have brunch at the restaurant side of Payard on a Sat afternoon. Luckily for us, there was no wait unlike the counter side that had a really long line. I loved the decor of the place. It was elegant but not so much so that you feel uncomfortable dining in shorts like I was. 

It's a lot smaller than I expected and you can see the chef cooking in a small "kitchen" in the middle of the restaurant. I decided to have the Croque Madame which came with a nice side salad and baked tomato. The salad was nice and refreshing but the sandwich was a little too heavy for me especially with the Vegas heat. 

I liked the crunch the outside of the sandwich had but I think they can go a little light on the cheese next time since the sauce that comes with it is pretty rich. For dessert, we had the Georges V and the mousse was so rich and delicious. The waiter told us it's one of the most popular desserts and I can see why. I totally recommend it if you're a chocolate lover like myself.
