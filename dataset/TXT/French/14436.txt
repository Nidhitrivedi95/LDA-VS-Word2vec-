Prices were high, making the Mtl a Table menu very worth it. The gnocchi appetizer was made with a very flavourful cheese. The cod was cooked perfectly. The dessert was tasty, but the layers were quite thick and it was a bit hard to eat through them all at once.

What I enjoyed most was the excellent service. Upscale but very friendly. Given the price, I might need to wait until my parents are back in town to come again!
