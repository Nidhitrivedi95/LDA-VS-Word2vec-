myJ6pgIhN42EQh2sAVXKoQ honestly i think this place makes the best burgers in toronto. i've been coming for 2 years and they are very consistent with their quality. the flavors are focused and the brioche bun is so good. their burgers don't get greasy like burger's priest. i like to get their take out special every month. i don't recommend getting their fries for take out though. they're thin cut and will get soggy and cold fast. definitely worth a try.
