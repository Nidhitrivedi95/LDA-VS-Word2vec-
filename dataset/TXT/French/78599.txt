ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug I first had yo wait in line only to be seated in a half empty dining room. The staff that sat me were very nice and helpful. I sat foe 10 min. Before someone said hello. It wasnt even my server, but the bus lady. She was awesome and checked on me the whole meal. Finally after another 5 min my server finally came over. She asked me if i knew what i wanted. French onion soup needed salt. Tuna sandwich was ok. I ate without anyone asking me if I needed anything. She brought my bill without asking if I wanted dessert.  Guess she doesn't like to make money. I gave her my credit card only for her to return and ask that I please fill it out cause she needed to go home. Wow! Is all I have to say.
