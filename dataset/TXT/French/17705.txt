9ot8oInkYZTt6wkkGe__vQ This was my first visit to Auberge; a friend and I attended for midweek lunch during Winterlicious. Overall, this was a good experience and given that we were there for the food festival, the value was terrific for the quality of food and service.  Everything we ordered was delicious, the portion sizes decent, and the staff very friendly and attentive.  We were disappointed that we were going to have to wait 30 minutes for our table, when we'd made a reservation and were on time; we agreed to sit elsewhere, though it would have been nicer to sit in the original spot.  We were also disappointed in the level of noise and upon mentioning it to our server, were advised that it was unusual for it to be that noisy, but due to the influx of patrons during Winterlicious, they were busier than usual, with several large groups contributing to the din.  I didn't look at the regular menu, so I don't know what the regular prices are, but I would definitely attend at full price.
