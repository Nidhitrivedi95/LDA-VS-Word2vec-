rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Really, what can I add after all of the great reviews everyone has already added.

In town for my company's national sales meeting, and we were staying at The Venetian.

We decided to have brunch our final morning at Bouchon, before heading to the airport, and not did we save one of our best meals for last.

From the gorgeous French baguette braid and butter, to the French toast and chicken & waffles, it was all so freakin amazing. So much so, that I am surprisingly wife with brunch at the Napa Valley location when we're there in Oct. for our 5th wedding anniversary. I called months in advance to make sure we had a good time, and table, to wrap up our trip to Napa. If the food is anything like the Vegas location, we'll be in for another treat.
