U1LB3sRMGTu_h7Sf9QdNoA Adorable place, good & helpful attitude from servers. Nice shady patio off of a square, just a short walk from FiDi but feels like Paris! My intent was to come for a late lunch- but apparently I was too late as they were no longer serving food, just coffee & pastries. I did eventually order a chocopan and Espresso Martini- and must say that the martini was strong!!! It turned out I wasn't the only disappointed customer to discover lunch wasn't being served as two other women who sat after me, were also surprised. Since I'm not in Toronto often, it will be an effort to come back to try the crepes- but we will see. In the meantime, I will have a leisurely late afternoon cocktail & hope others will see this review if they were anticipating a late lunch.
