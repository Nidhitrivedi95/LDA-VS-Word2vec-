cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg Summary: Delicious food but overall experience left something to be desired. When making a reservation ask not to be seated next to the cellar if you get cold easily!

Food tip: PDC's Melting Pot is the best we tried on our table (vs. The fried chicken, oysters and pork chops that other members of our party ordered). The Melting Pot was literally a small pot with a bunch of different porks (pork flank, blood sausage and some others I don't recall) that seemed to be slow cooked and then laid on a bed of the most delicious mashed potatoes ever. This was a seriously good meal. The pork chops were a close second but I with someone on our table had tried the PDC's Cut because I suspect that would have been delicious.

Atmosphere: The interior is very nice despite the single bathroom that means there will be a consistent line of anxious people waiting to use the bathroom if you sit by the cellar in the back and it is busy. The seating up front by the window looked like a nicer place to be in the summer. It was also cold by the cellar because they kept leaving the door open very long when going in there. 

Drinks: Lovely as well but not sure how the bartender did not know what either a French 75 or a Moscow Mule were despite having a full bar and no cocktail menu (i.e. you'd expect they know some classic drinks). I ended up having a simple Hendricks tonic with cucumber and it was perfect. I also like that they bring the tonic/soda water in a separate little beaker.

One negative: The declined to give us the wifi password because the owner "does not like people being on their phones". Except this was only a problem for tourists because most people were locals and we're using their phones in the restaurant!
