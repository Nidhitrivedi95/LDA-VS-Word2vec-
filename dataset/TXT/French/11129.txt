The food is superb, the service quite good by local standards, prices are very reasonable, the atmosphere inside and out are wonderful. The soups, salads, and entrees have been very very nice, fresh and perfectly cooked. I've been twice with a group of friends and we had a very good time. Really an oasis in this culinary desert.
