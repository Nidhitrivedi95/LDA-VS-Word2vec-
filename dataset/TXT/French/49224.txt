oR0a8o24L237PWYCRAF4cQ Great restaurant. I ate here with five friends on a Friday night in June 2017. We couldn't have been happier. Good food, good wine, good service. I have one vegetarian friend and one gluten-free friend and both were able to find food on the menu. Very friendly staff, nice atmosphere.
