LQ_gYNs5E10IGFE0NOyD7A What a beautiful restaurant with such charm and appeal!  We came in for dinner one evening and shared a cheese/meat board and two sandwiches - the Fro-Magg and the Little Havana.  We had way too much food, but all of it was delicious. Our server was great too - so much fun and helped guide us through our choices.
