U4e-0KtL2aPURQwbefjF3Q Great place for fast, delicious Schwarmas! I'm a big fan.

Located just west of Bay on Gerrard, this hidden gem always has a line at lunch time. The service is great and food is flavourful.

I typically order the Chicken Schwarma ($5.99). Lots of vegetarian options and the fries are fantastic. 

About 3 small tables to sit out back.

Good tip:  stock up on napkins as the fully packed wrap always ends up dripping (maybe on pants)!
