A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g Worst place for lunch and even worse place for service. First the lady taking my order insisted on having conversations with her coworkers during the order process. So I was continually asked to repeat myself. Then after I fully ordered I was told that there wasn't any ham or turkey left...kind of important to know since I was ordering a turkey sandwich to begin with. Not to mention how does a sandwich shop run out of ham and turkey? Sit down with my Mother and 15 minutes later she's told the spinach quiche she ordered isn't available either so she would have to change her order. 30 minutes later she still hasn't received her food. Poor communication and unhelpful service equals me never coming back.
