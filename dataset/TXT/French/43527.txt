lzwNoKVBC5eJe87151tPSA I've been to both 98 south and their sister restaurant 56 east.  Gotta say that I like 56 east A LOT better even though they have almost identical menus.  The fish and burgers were overcooked here.  The prices seemed a little heftier.  The service was spotty.  

The kicker was that my posse and I went during happy hour and were seated in the main dining area.  After ordering, the waitress let us know that we couldn't have happy hour pricing on our food because we were seated in the main dining room!  And she knew that we were there for happy hour because we had told her as we were walking to the table.  I have to say, what a great way to milk customers for a larger tip!
