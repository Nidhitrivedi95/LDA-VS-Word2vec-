WOO81gScY3_VpaIfXFAKpw We started our journey with a wonderful glass of white wine and a deconstructed caprice salad.  The salad was fantastic with savory oils that complemented the mushrooms (my fave), tomatoes and cheese. Next course was a blue corn tamale with tomatillo salsa.  The tamale was filled with tasty chicken and the salsa had just enough spice.  My friend had potato leek soup that I had to sample more than one sooo good.  I'm getting me some of that when I go back!  Ok main dish was a homemade chorizo stuffed chicken breast with cilantro rice.  To be honest I don't eat chorizo I am not a fan......I ate it all it was terrific.  The tastes blended so well I wanted to have them make extra to take home.  The meal ended with banana ice cream with bananas foster on the side.  I couldn't stop drooling at the beautiful presentation but it tasted even better! The chef came out to say hi and I told him I loved him! This was one of the best meals I have had! Thank you cafe blue Lots of love from this monkey!
