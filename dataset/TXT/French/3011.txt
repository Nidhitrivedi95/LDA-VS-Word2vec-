1aj4TG0eFq6NaPBKk6bK7Q I absolutely love this place. I love that they have organic, vegan, gluten free, and even tea options. Every time i've gone in, the staff is super friendly and helpful. The first time I went in, I probably looked like a deer in headlights because I was confused on what to order, I couldn't believe they had so many vegan and organic options. I was definitely surprised. The food was great, the decor was so nice. Ive been both, during lunch and dinner. I've sat on the patio and loved it. I love sitting inside at night. They dim the lights and it can be very romantical. I love this place. I hope they don't change things, and stay the way they are.
