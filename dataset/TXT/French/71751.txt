xeFVRUjxorxjO_qjX8FNdw I went here with a couple of friends for a nice casual outing. The restaurant has a very great casual atmosphere  and have great gelato options. I had the schnitzel here, which is usually ordered as pork, but I requested to have it make as a chicken schnitzel and they were able to do that. The customer service was great and would come back here. Parking is available easily around the plaza.
