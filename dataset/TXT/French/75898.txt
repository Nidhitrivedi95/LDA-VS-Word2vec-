ynYEgNimJOyb8dvyr9x0sA Had been trying to try this place since it was highly reviewed in the Az. Republic several months ago.  I thought it would be best to go in the fall/winter when it would be cooler and more in keeping with fondue and raclette.  Finally did it today which was certainly not cool.  Boy! Am I glad we did.  Went there with my wife and myself as well as my son and his girlfriend.  We found the food choices to be quite extensive.  We ordered French Fondue and Swiss Raclette.  
The fondue came first and the four of us enjoyed it very much.  Whether by accident or not, just as we had finished the fondue, the raclette came out.  This was much better than getting both dishes served at the same time.  Don't know if that's the way the restaurant planned it but if not, they should give some thought to doing it that way so the fondue can be enjoyed and then the raclette instead of serving both at the same time and the two dishes( and tastes) competeing with each other.  Both dishes were superb.
Afterward we had crepes.....o ne was chocolate and banana.  The other was ultimate chocolate.  Both crepes were enough for two and were thoroughly enjoyable.
Would thoroughly recommend Le Chalet at any time of year.  Only regret is that I waited so long.
