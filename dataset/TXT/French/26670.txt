Da6eZFThE9xanUAGNpZxAg Came here on a Thursday night for birthday celebration. They were very accommodating with the home-made cake I brought. They event brought it out on a plate with a candle! 

Charcuterie board was a great experience! We ordered 5 meats, 5 cheese and 5 olives. Honestly I can't remember which ones we ordered but majority of them were great. The olives not so much though - I would recommend sticking with 3 or less. 

The atmosphere was pretty causal but they dimmed the lights around 9ish and it became a perfect causal date night spot. 

Although the overall service by the restaurant was great, our server was a bit odd. He really didn't seem like he wanted to be there lol
