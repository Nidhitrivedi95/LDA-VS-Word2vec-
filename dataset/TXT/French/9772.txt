4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw 3.5 stars - food is good but service is spotty

We are here for a conference and took a customer for lunch.  We all enjoyed our food but the service was spotty.  I had to ask for refills for our empty wine glasses when we ordered a bottle.  One person didn't drink so got soda and I had to remind the server several time to give my guest more soda.

We ordered:
1. Escargot
2. Smoked Salmon
3. Warm Brie
4. Scallops
5. Fish of the day (Sea Bass)
6. Burger and Fries
7. Seafood crepe
8. Bottle of Montrachet

The food are good and I would come back for lunch.  I hope to get better service on my next visit!
