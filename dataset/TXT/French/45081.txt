mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q This, along side of its big brother next door, are the best restaurants in Vegas. The food is mind blowing. Service is as good as it gets. The atmosphere is top notch. 

One thing about the menu. Everything is good. But if you want to taste the world's greatest mashed potatoes, you will find them there. 

If you hit it big and have enough extra money in your pocket to either buy used Kia or have dinner, treat yourself and go here. Its insanely expensive. If you are a foodie like me, it is well worth it. Does not get much better than this.
