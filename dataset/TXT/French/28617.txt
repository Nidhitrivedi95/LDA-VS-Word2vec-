eJ9L40jm5VOXCIq7xs9kQw I was in Montreal for my birthday and we went to dinner to celebrate at this french restaurant. The foie gras creme brulee was amazing. I am from france and I was baffled. Duck confit and filet mignon were really good too. The one complain I have would be the sides - In my world, duck confit always goes with sauteed potatoes and steamed veggies just won't cut it. Still 5 stars for my foie gras creme brulee hands down!
