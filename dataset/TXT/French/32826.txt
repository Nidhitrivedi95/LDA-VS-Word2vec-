h28ZxheMQdpqHcAw_ge6gw Tried Bacchanal for a friend's birthday dinner - the food was excellent (we all had the steak frites, with the green beans and the ratatouille, and ended with the Paris Brest and coffee) but the service we had was awful ... like, just awful, from our server, the guy who brought out bread and helped serve our entrees, and from the hostess who tried to move us to another table just as we were finishing our coffees. I live up the street and won't be going back.
