tAj-0ZPUATzLHS0KHzXFBQ My very first experience at a Swiss raclette restaurant was here today and as usual, after checking the reviews on Yelp which were quite positive, I didn't hesitate to give it a try. I can't say I was impressed nor disappointed but it was one of them experiences where you'd feel happy you've had the chance to at least experience a novelty for the sake of discovering something new. We tried the three course raclette and fondue. We were two couples. You'd get stuffed if you can finish them all.
 
Pro: - Very tasty and high quality deer tartare
         - Amazingly tasty and rich raclette cheese
         - Awesome desserts. We tried the chocolate
            dome with hot caramel sauce and poire 
            Hélène. Both are excellent choices
          - Very nice and attentive staff, they'd even
             come outside of the restaurant upon your 
             arrival and help you find a parking spot if    
             you ask them to
          - They sell $6 parking pass so you can park
              your car in the reserved residential spots
              on streets nearby
           - BYOW

Con: - Not much except for the price. For two, 
             It cost us $130 with tax and tip and it's a 
             BYOW. Well, it's Swiss Harry, not a falafel
             joint. Duh! Right. 
          - You'd need to go to the gym the following 
              day to burn them rich damn calories
          - Cholesterol? Haha, you're in the wrong 
              restaurant.  

I'd go back but only on a special occasion and
I'd order the raclette if it's me and my significant other. The cheese in this one is superior to the fondue. Anyhow, my next fondue would be a regular one, not cheese. I can survive for a few weeks after here today without cheese. But damn, it was good tho.
