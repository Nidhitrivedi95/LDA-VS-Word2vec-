Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA Hands down one of the most incredible dining experiences I've ever had.  The views from this place are sick but even better, the food (truffles and foie gras galore), wine, service, and atmosphere are top notch.  It is not often you can get an incredible meal with decadent, beautifully prepared food & superior service in a modern, hip setting.  Mix does all this and more.   After dinner, move to the lounge for great cocktails and people watching. http://www.alain-ducasse.com/public/index.htm
