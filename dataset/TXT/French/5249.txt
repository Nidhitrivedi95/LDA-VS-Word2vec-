3FlWR_osNPb8dcqLgHebHw I love the muffins, the soup and salad deal is good and the choices and combinations are just enough!
The atmosphere is relax and the music is inviting, food portions are just right and the choices plenty but not overwhelming!
I would have given this place a 5 star but unfortunately the service was less then great while my waitress was polite you could tell she would rather be somewhere else.

Over all good but room for improvement I will definitely be back and I'm sure it will be better!
