YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g This place was pretty good. When we first walked in my initial thought was this isn't going to be a good dining experience cause it was so packed, but we got seated the server was on top of it.

i had the tasting menu and nothing really stood out to me where I could tell you how my experience was, but because our server was so excellent, i felt that they deserved 3 stars.
