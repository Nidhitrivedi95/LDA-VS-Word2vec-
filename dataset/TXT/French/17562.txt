9OaeSZ-JqYSnOTWP3GD2rg Lovely, well-designed little café with an open kitchen run by very nice folks. 49th Parallel Epic Espresso is the bean of choice here and well prepared. The Cannelé are incredible. I've only stopped here for breakfast, but I bet they serve a really lovely meal. Clear pride in the product. Worth stopping by, for sure.
