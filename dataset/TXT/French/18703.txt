AHosGBveeXx9YjsQvdJgeg For Native Charlotteans and those who have been in Charlotte long enough to remember The Fish Market across from Southpark, the owner of Bentley's used to work there. In any case, Bentley's on 27 offers a wonderful dining experience with a great view. 

We started with the Oysters Bentley (yum) and Tuna carpiccio. We had stuffed shrimp and halibut dishes for our entree. Both of which were beautifully executed! Our wine selection was Far Niente (an excellent wine for those who don't care for overly buttery/ too-heavily-oaked Chardonnay). Instead of dessert, we opted to have Port and Cognac after dinner... ahh... the good life! However, as we were there for a birthday celebration, we did end up njoying a birthday sweet after all! 

Throughout the evening, our server was very attentive, entertaining, and was a true professional - which sadly, in this day & age is no longer a given (even at this level of restaurant). 

Since this place is a splurger, we haven't been back yet, but will certainly go again for another special occasion!
