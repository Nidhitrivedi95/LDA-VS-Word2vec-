UpEVdq_euH-5mqCIgUAd2Q It's a cozy little place right on Front street. Menu is reasonably priced and ambiance is quaint. I always find the best way to rate a French Restaurant is to try their French Onion soup. I found their soup to be liquids and cheese to be right out of a box. Food is as French as Taco Bell is Mexican.
