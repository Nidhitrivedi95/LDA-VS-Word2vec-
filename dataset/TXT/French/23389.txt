It's hidden behind some beautiful iron gates and not super visible from the street, so make sure you've got it pulled up on your GPS. The patio itself is inside the shell of an old building and full of lovely trees, really something special. Our group tried a bunch of their small plates as shared tapas, which is not really how you're supposed to order, but everything was wonderful. Our server was excellent and very accommodating. Highly recommend the tuna tartare and the beef tataki!
