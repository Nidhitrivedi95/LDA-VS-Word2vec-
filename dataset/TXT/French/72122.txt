XKPosZx2j4RHcZ8Ewdwj0A Totally overpriced !
It just a really basic French cheap bistro (and I'm French).
The food it's just eatable...
The dining room it's too noisy and the service is bad.
This restaurant just got a famous name, that's only why people come here.
My advice : just go across the street at l'Évêque.
