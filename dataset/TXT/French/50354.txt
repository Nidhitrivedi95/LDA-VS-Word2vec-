ovtlrcsVRlgZZQUlHs_ovw Best West Side dining in the valley. Aurora makes anything taste like heaven. I meet people from all over the world that visit the Valley and every one that has taken the trip to Vogue have been amazed. Great atmosphere, great service and quality preparations that compete on an international level have made my referrals come back to the Valley just for Vogue. Excellent wine and cocktail selection and some very unusual cocktail specialties. Prices that are very reasonable and by Scottsdale comparison just plain cheap.
