0JGMKaKJGVuDus5WcJzvjw Yum yum!  Great vibe and great food.  I struggled a bit with the menu with my non-existent french but our waitress was very helpful with all the choices. We tried an assortment of their recommended plates and everything was tasty.  Must make reservations well in advance since this is a popular spot.  Brussel sprouts and lobster spaghetti were my favorites.
