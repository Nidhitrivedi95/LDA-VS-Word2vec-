once again, i concur. great location- on the shore you have shitloads of places to eat and drink- just on the corner you have fishers, probably the best seafood restaurant in edinburgh, and next it, a bar called the shore that is cozy and often has local live music.

the hotel itself from the outside is like a mini castle without the tower, so yeah, maybe just big and old fading bricks and old looking. the rooms are minimalistic. great bed, pillows and comforter.  the staff are helpful, the breakfasts are great, get the eggs benedict.  the bar seems to stay open later for the guests than any of the pubs around during weekdays, so even after i was no longer a guest i worked it.  if you are a gambling addict, there is a casino around the corner with a great buffet at midnight, often chinese. no live poker sadly.
