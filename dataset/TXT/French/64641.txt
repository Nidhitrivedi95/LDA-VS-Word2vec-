Tefx_N6A6nrsdj4jHHnbYg Felt like something quick and light to eat. Yelped it and found this cute little French cafe. Thanks yelp, you did not lead us astray. And yes...I got a croissant. And yes.....it was amazing!! I ordered the plain butter croissant - delicate and flaky. The chocolate chip cookie was really good too. The girl behind the counter, Sam was so sweet and friendly. I was there with my boyfriend but if I was still dating , this would be a perfect place for a quick coffee online date. The decor is tasteful and charming. The presentation  of a simple croissant was done beautifully. I would highly recommend this place. Let's support the small local cafes instead of making Starbucks richer.
