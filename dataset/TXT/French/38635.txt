jLxeBgWhLRbII2ACkgH1Sg I've  been looking for a cafe to hang out at while hubby & I wait for the kids to get out of Sunday school. I found this place on yelp and told hubby to come here. He said he knew exactly where it was because he delivered here before. He never been in the cafe only in the back where he delivers so it was our first time. He's a coffee person & I'm a pastry person. So we both got what we love. First thing I saw was that they served Peet's coffee. That was a plus. I love Peet's over starbucks. The coffee was amazing. If you dine here they serve your coffee in a coffee cup with a little saucer underneath. That's real coffee house status.  I was excited to see all the French pastries they had. I ended up with an almond croissant.  OMG! To die for!  We met David the new owner and a very nice man who introduced himself and chit-chatted with us for a bit. This place also serves delicious breakfast plates that look amazing. We love this place! All the staff were so nice and helpful and I can't wait for next Sunday to come!
