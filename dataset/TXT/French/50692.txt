OYHpqY6-3C-wXR-uPbHhwA I selected this restaurant for a first time visit with an out of town guest.  It looked like a nice spot for breakfast.  The staff was very disorganized.  It took 35 minutes for our order to be prepared.  Other guests who arrived after us were served first.  The pecan cinnamon bun was hard as a rock.  I asked for a manager and was told she's in early everyday through the week.  Very disatisfied.
