1aj4TG0eFq6NaPBKk6bK7Q I can't believe I'm seeing poor reviews for this place! I literally come here one a week at most, and I haven't experienced anything that would even hurt my opinion of them.

The decor in the restaurant is awesome. It has a french theme going on, so everything looks elegant and beautiful. 

The food. I love it. I normally get their Drive-In burger and its amazing. It's juicy, the sauce is delicious, just everything about it is delish. When I originally came here a few months back, I didn't think much of the burger honestly. But they've improved the quality a lot since then! 

The Bonini ice cream is just, I can't even put it into words. If you have a sweet tooth like I have, you'd love it. It's ice cream and chocolate crunch, all wrapped up in a heated sweet bun.

Overall, great service, great food, and great pricing as well.
