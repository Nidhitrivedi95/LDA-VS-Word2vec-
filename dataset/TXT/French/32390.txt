gxMa7j1LXIUxxBoP0osDpA We decided to eat here based on the Yelp & UrbanSpoon reviews. While I thought the food was very good, I don't consider it the most memorable meal and the wait between our appetizer and entree was unacceptable. Probably 45 minutes and the waiter never checked on us and seemed oblivious to the fact that our meal had not arrived. The scallop ceviche appetizer was lovely, summery, light and balanced.  My daughter loved her salmon fumee with couscous and seaweed butter. I thought my husband's fish special with lobster bisque, sweet peas & wheat berries was the best dish of the evening. While my duck with celeriac, beets & lemon-thyme sauce was nice, it was similar to many dishes I've had elsewhere. As I said earlier, the entire evening was marred for me by the long wait. I think they are understaffed with the servers washing dishes, slicing bread & refilling water on top of running downstairs to fetch the food.
