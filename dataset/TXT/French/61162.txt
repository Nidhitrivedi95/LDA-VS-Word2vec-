It's more professional than I was expecting too, so obviously I got different results. Not that the crêpe is even close to bad, but you know, they just make the pastry, add some pre-cut fruits and cover it in chocolate sauce. This by any means can taste bad. But when the fruit is fresh cut it tastes better, when they make the crêpe with the fruit, everything tastes different (the fruits are a bit warm), etc. 

So, it's just a 3-star crêpe. I have had better ones. Service was standard, everything was three-star.
