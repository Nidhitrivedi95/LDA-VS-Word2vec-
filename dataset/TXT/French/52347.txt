PxJXsLv6cad2YJAwj_LfAw Exceptional service! We decided to sit on the pateo since it was such a beautiful day too bad the tables are made out of metal and it was just too hot for our liking. We decided to bring our drinks and our beautiful selves inside lolol. The bartender was so sweet and genuine. It was his first day and was super nervous to get the drinks perfectly right to our likings. The drinks were great and They are very well reputable for the fine selection of wines and other alcoholic beverages. 

We ordered a crême brûlée as well and devoured the delicious bowl full of temptation.

We definitely recommend this place to have a drink and enjoy a wonderful time with friends or co-workers. Service was amazing super quick and attentive both the bartender and waitress were super friendly and happy to serve us. The food was 5stars!! Top notch! Super happy with our experience and will definitely be back on another occasion.

Thank you for this afternoon a big thumbs up!!!!
