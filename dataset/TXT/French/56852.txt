rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Ahh, our first Tom Keller restaurant and it did not disappoint.  We planned a last minute trip to Las Vegas and Bouchon was first on our list for where to have dinner and it did not disappoint.  We have the Ad Hoc (Tom Keller) cookbook and every single thing we've made from it has been so good it makes you want to lick the plate clean.

Phenomenal service, food, atmosphere, a great couple next to us from B-more, did I mention the food?  I still regret not ordering the onion soup (we split the appetizer special for the day, an amazing ground pork sausage in pumpkin mash and such) but I'm extremely happy I held out for dessert.  I hesitate to go over everything we had as I feel that part of the experience is doing the picking yourself.  Suffice it to say, we had a night of mmmms and ahhhs and thoroughly enjoyed every bite.

We enjoyed it so much we returned the next morning for breakfast, which again, was freaking fantastic.  We'll be back and maybe we'll hit up some other Tom Keller spots in between!
