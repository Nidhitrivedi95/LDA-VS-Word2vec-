We ordered Escargot, the Salmon appetizer, Salmon Spinach Salad, some egg pie thing, Muscles, and a Bacon Cheeseburger with fries. Escargot was on point! Great sauce they used for that. The Salmon appetizer was to die for! The Salmon Spinach Salad was amazing! They definitely were not greedy with the size of the salmon either. The Muscles were awesome, and the sauce on it went perfect for the free bread they give you in the beginning. The Bacon Cheeseburger was huge! And the french fries with it were different but delicious!

The only downer was that the Bloody Mary Bar is only on Sundays and they didn't have Oysters because they were doing construction on their Oyster Bar.
