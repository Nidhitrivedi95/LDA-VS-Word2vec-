Overall, the food was just not seasoned perfectly - it was almost always over-seasoned making it too salty and too saucy. For a top rated restaurant, I would expect every dish to be perfect. 

Calamari - crispiness was good but too much fish sauce and way too much lime made it more sour than desirable. 

Beef Tartare - The beef alone is very soft and delicious so I didn't understand why the wasabi and soy sauce was used in excess as though it needed to mask the taste of the rare beef. 

Fish wrap - This was good and not "too saucy" but the item itself seems pretty ordinary...I would have expected something more unique from the menu

Pork Special Wrap - good, and good to those who don't normally eat Asian cuisine but it felt ordinary to me who normally eats this dish (or a similar variation of it) at home

Lettuce Meal - a good stomach filler since the other dishes are small. The beef was too saucy IMO. While I like a lot of sauce normally on my food, I don't like it when it means my food is too salty. It would have been better if the sauce in the pan was milder as the beef itself was very well done and tender. I didn't like the side of kim chi - too sour - and I am normally a kim chi lover. 

Expect the food to take long to come out as they have a small kitchen. We waited probably 45-55mins before our first dish came out. 

What I will say is their servers are nice. I ran extremely late for my reso but they found a way to accomodate me. 

So, I would say this is a nice little spot for casual dining with a small group of friends or one other friend but don't come with the expectation that the food will be incredible (because it's a top rated restaurant) or you'll be disappointed.
