fVF5wayDyY6ZR5oJB1IK3g Very busy on Sunday morning, Lawrence is quite popular! We had brunch there and had very good coffee. In terms of food, I had salmon with scramble egg and my friend took cranberry and apple French toast, I have to admit that I prefer my friend's pick! The price is slightly high for the portion, but it's still acceptable. I would recommend this place!
