fFInb4Dl2Ix4iE-VOltbkQ This place really knows all about service. The lady who took our reservation for my daughters engagement dinner could not have been more helpful. Unfortunately we had to cancel the original booking because of flight cancellations but when I called back on Monday to re-schedule she remembered everything about the original booking. On the night the food was excellent and the service for first class. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone. Now if only the airlines could take a leaf out of their book .............
