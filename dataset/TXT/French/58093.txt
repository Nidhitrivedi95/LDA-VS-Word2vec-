rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A My brother and I have eaten at Bouchon before and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. So when my wife said she HAD to got to Bouchon, there were no complaints on our end. The only problem is that we only had 3 nights in Vegas and 4 restaurants that we HAD to go to. The solution, Bouchon for breakfast. 

Now, mind you, I am not a breakfast person. I definitely don't like the fatty fried crap Americans call breakfast food. However, breakfast here was definitely an experience! I am not an expert of baked goods, nor do I usually like to eat them, but I got a hold of my wife's croissant. Boy was that a mistake! I didn't want to give it back to her! What?! Me eat a croissant because I want to?! That just can't be true. Let me tell you, I have been to France, but never eaten like this. It's another must visit in the culinary mecca within Vegas.
