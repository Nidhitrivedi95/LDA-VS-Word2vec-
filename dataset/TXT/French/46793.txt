nkHaix6KenApS8M-liZsCQ Sometimes I like to treat myself to a classy lunch...ALONE.  This is my favorite place to do so!! $20 lunch special gets three courses; I had the red pepper soup, grilled veggie sandwich and the chocolate tower. 

Once again, I'm thrilled by the top notch service, impeccable food, and wonderful atmosphere. I'm writing this review as I sit at the kitchen bar, watching chefs and sous chefs bustle around...it's like Christmas. I also like hearing the communication around the kitchen. These guys are making sure the duck salad is plated last so everyone's lunches are fresh and quality. There's something to be said for professionalism and passion, and these chefs demonstrate both. 

Do yourself a favor and come eat here. Happy hour is the best around and you won't be disappointed. Promise.
