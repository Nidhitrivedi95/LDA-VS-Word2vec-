4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I am a big food snob and I know it. This restaurant delivers in both service, although a bit slow, and food. I highly suggest you give it a try. Ask for Isabelle, sit outside and enjoy. The chicken liver mousse is just divine! I also tried the gazpacho a friend had and found it perfect. For an entree I had the frisee salad with warm bacon and a poached egg on top. The entire dish was simply amazing, the egg perfectly poached and delish! My partner had the prime burger with brie, it was Cooked to perfection and tasty too. I hardly ever give 5 stars but this delightful restaurant surely deserves it!
