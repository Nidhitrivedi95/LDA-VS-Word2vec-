58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw We met up with the boyfriend's mum and sister for a weekend in Montreal while his sister was at a conference and decided to try to find a good place to walk to for brunch in Old Montreal, near where we were staying. With the help of Yelp, I found Le Cartet.

The space is long and thin, going way, way back. There is lots of space if you are coming with a bigger group, but it was pretty busy. If they take reservations (I'm not sure, the three of us walked in) it would be a good idea to make some for a larger group. You walk through a small market on your way in where you could grab pre-packaged sandwiches, salads and the like if you're in a hurry

Part of what attracted us to this place was the really nice brunch options -  they're definitely unique. I really liked that you could order dishes that included a little bit of everything, perfect for someone like me who often has angst about what we're forgoing to order our meal. I had the Brunch Cartet, he had the Burnch Toscan and his mum had the Brunch de l'Atlantique. Everyone really enjoyed everything, though my scrambled eggs were cooked harder than I prefer and the croissant wasn't as flakey as you can sometimes get in Montreal, the variety made up for it. Go with an appetite, though, because all of these brunches are a lot of food!

The fresh Illy coffee was also tasty and especially appreciated because it was a chilly morning, and I liked that coffee and fresh squeezed juice were included with brunch (or a mimosa! but none of us partook) It was a little pricey for breakfast, but not too bad for brunch (around $17 each) I'd definitely recommend this place for a nice brunch or breakfast in Old Montreal, which is an area that can be really hit and miss for food.
