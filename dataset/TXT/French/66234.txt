UL-FJ_EMbtjfoRNA7id_Ig Great ambiance, service, and food. Had no preconceived notions going in. Didn't know that this place was owned by the same people that were behind Ascari. But, this place is exactly what the east end needs. The highlight for me was the wine list. Like Ascari, it was curated nicely and well thought out. The one thing I would love to see is a real French style burger on the menu. Then this place would be epic.
