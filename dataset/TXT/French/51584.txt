pKiSzUlBBRNEdTML24piXA I bought a Groupon for this place a while back and hadn't gotten around to using it - then my birthday was here! What a great excuse to go out on a Wednesday!

So, went to Centurion last night with the boyfriend for my birthday. We had made a reservation, but there really wasn't any need to since there were maybe 5 couples in and out while we were there. It's a very small space and we sat out on the patio in the lovely evening weather (can't believe I did patio dining for my Feb birthday - but that's Phoenix, eh?).

The beer selection was small but interesting, however the one we wanted was not available, so we chose a bottle of wine from Bordeaux (for $21!). We ordered the strudel since it sounded adventurous and was it ever delicious! We chose to split the Gnocchi with Shiitake Mushrooms and Dijon Cream sauce and the White Truffle Pizza. The Gnocchi was perfectly tender and the mushrooms were delicious in the cream sauce. Very rich but not too heavy to split. The pizza was so tasty and I am now slightly regretting letting the boyfriend take the leftover half with him to work today!

The dessert was the icing on the cake, so to speak. I love tiny sweets, not gigantic slices of cake - especially after a fairly rich meal. They served us a tiny espresso cup made out of chocolate, filled with espresso mousse, with a bit of blueberry reduction. DIVINE! I love the chocolate and espresso combo, and the presentation of it with the edible cup was adorable!

All in all, a very pleasant experience with attentive service, great presentation, and delightfully tasty food. I can't wait to try their brunch!
