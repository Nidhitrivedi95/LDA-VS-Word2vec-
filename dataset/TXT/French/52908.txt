QeEQXdto_4wFRaNKyIygRA I'm totally confused. It's called French Quarter, giving the southern-Nola type food idea, owned by Greek people, and called French food. I looked at the menu and saw more Greek options than Nola/French inspired. In fact there was like one "cajun" option......So why be deceitful? Being from Louisiana I'm always skeptical of french/cajun restaurants but this one didn't even try! Sorry....not falling for the trick.
