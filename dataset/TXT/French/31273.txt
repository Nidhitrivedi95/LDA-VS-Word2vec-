We had the cozido Portuguesa as a starter along with the snails cooked in a creamy Chardonnay sauce topped with mixed cheeses. Followed by the special of the day. Beef cheeks that were so tenderly cooked they literally melted in your mouth. The food acidity was balanced by the creamy wine sauce and fatty components of the tenderly cooked meat. Just like velvet in ones mouth. We'll definitely be back
