hvjgF-vnPw2jyL5DBuB0qg Waited so long to try this restaurant, it's really hard to get a reservation. We went there because we watch Chuck's day off and we heard so much about his poutine that won Iron chef that we had to tick it off our food bucket list. First, we waited 45 mins before they take our orders. Waitress apologized and said "Sorry it's friday night so we're reaaaally busy." OK? Did this place just open a week ago or what?? Its a freaking restaurant of course its busy on Fridays

Lobsters are not in season and we were informed by the waitress that the price would be 36$ Since we really wanted to try it we went for it...when the poutine came, our jaws just dropped. I mean- Why would you charge much higher than the regular price and bring just a normal poutine with literally 6 pieces of curd cheese and tiny bit of lobster on top...just why...and seriously there was maybe just 2 tablespoon of gravy poured on it. Its okay to charge 36$ for a lobster that is not in season but to charge and bring no lobster is a f* joke. Anyway, for what I tasted, it was still pretty good, because any normal poutine you eat is good.
....still can't get over the fact I paid 36$ for fries lol 

The mushroom risotto was delicious but the squash spaghetti with a piece of mozzarella on top was awful. 

I will give this place another chance because I really want to try their real lobster poutine, so i'll definitely come back in the summer. But for the rest, there are sooo many better options in Old Montreal!
