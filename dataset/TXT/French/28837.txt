el-3IdlW3bTCSnquLvH-3w I have been here twice -- once for dinner and once for lunch. Service was a bit on the slower side, but knowing that it's operated by small number of people, it's reasonable.

I just LOVE hearing them speaking in French.  It'll make you feel like you are in France!!   Everything I tried was very tasty, but let me remind you -- this is a French food after all.  So, it's on the heavy side with cheese and everything else.  A little bit of food will fill you up rather quickly and their portion size is very generous.  Unless you are ready to take some leftover home, think twice before you order.
