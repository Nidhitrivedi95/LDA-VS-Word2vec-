rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A We were staying at the Palazzo and saw ads all over the place for Bouchon so we decided what the hey, we'll try it out for breakfast. In a word, delicious. The restaurant has a nice atmosphere, our server was great, and the food was plentiful. For $22 I received coffee, pastry (chocolate croissant, yum), fruit cup, and a plate of eggs, potatoes, toast, and spinach. Well worth the price. My wife got fancy banana waffles with a side of bacon and she enjoyed it as well.

We'll be back on our next trip, but maybe we'll head over there for lunch or dinner to see what else they have to offer.
