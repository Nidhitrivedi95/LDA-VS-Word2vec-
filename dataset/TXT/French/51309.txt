P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ This is a magnificent restaurant. Some of the dishes will not appeal to inexperienced palettes: the foie gras bitter infusion, served with kumquat, is not a "crowd-pleaser" per se, but it is sublime if you appreciate this delicacy. Other items on the menu, such as the artichoke and black truffle soup, are impossible not to enjoy. The cheese cart is superb.
