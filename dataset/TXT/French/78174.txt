YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g We were on a top chef tour in Vegas and wanted to try this spot by Hubert Keller. We ended up eating Brunch and I ordered the traditional breakfast. It came with a large portion of delicious bacon along with delicious potatoes. My wife had the HK burger which also was delicious! We would recommend it as a quick brunch spot.
