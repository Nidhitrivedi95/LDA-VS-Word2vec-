qmh6zxtJ8C8-YiUPv7ySlw 4 stars fir the food and the extra one for service. Just for being at WYNN was already a treat for us with the comped show tickets and dinner package. Since we has a pre-show dinner, our reservation was early at 5:30. We got the table closest to the water and had no one else around. Our waiter was so attentive and detailed.

My wife and I ordered from the prefix menu. WOW, not the typical French bistro with little portions, but rather so much that we didn't get to finish everything and had to run off to the show.
