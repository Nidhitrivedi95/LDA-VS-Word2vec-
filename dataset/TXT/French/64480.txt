tCSlpwJQ4CZsUEMZeH2SFg I've never been to France.  I know people who have, and I know people who grew up in France, but from the stories I've heard, Cafe Monte sounds like it could exist quite easily on many Parisian corners. It's casual and sophisticated at the same time, unobtrusive and genuine. And the food is killer.

Cafe Monte has become my favorite brunch location.  Their cuisine is in the country French style: very comforting, a light hint of French sophistication, and features ingredients you would easily expect to find on the farm or at the market. My first venture included the Benedict Monte, a hybrid concoction that seems to fuse the French and American versions of this dish into a delightfully delicious meal. Soft, crunchy English muffins, oozing eggs, and a smooth Hollandaise.  I've also tried the French country breakfast, which is equally amazing. The coffee is great, too - nothing over the top, just good tasting lattes and coffees.

If the lunch and dinner offerings are just as good, I could see visiting here very often.
