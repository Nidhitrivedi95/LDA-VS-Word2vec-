OZC42gnhlJ_auXduDRfMoQ Scratch this place off your list! Unsure what's worse: Scratch's ambiance, service, or food quality. A French ex-photographer opened this restaurant and you would think it would match Parisian cafes or at least other local restaurants in quality of service & food.. The bad: situated on a concrete base, with no added plants/lights/other outdoor accessories AND no music it felt like we dined in the middle of an empty parking lot. The ugly: stale bread, cheap ingredients (arugula as side for both hummous and burger, store fries), thick balsamic vinaigrette, burgers not cooked to our preference (why ask?), tiny plastic cups for water (we are not toddlers). Worse yet- our server was wearing the filthiest uniform & dirty sneakers one might wear to mow the lawn on Sundays, our food arrived 20 min AFTER the table next to us got theirs (of course they sat down 10mins AFTER us, do the math), and our drink orders went through 3 servers before ending up on our table. Will not come again and will warn fellow downtowners from trying this mess out!
