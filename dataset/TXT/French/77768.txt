YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g YUM!

Met here for a business lunch & celebration!  First time for 2 out of 3 of us and were very excited to see what all was on the menu. 

We started off with the marinated olives. A nice assortment all with very distinct flavors. 
We then tried the onion soup shooter - DELICIOUS!  If you like cream soups, this is it! 
Light onion flavor cream with truffle oil. I could have eaten an entire bowl!

The shrimp lettuce wraps were good, however nothing stood out about them. 

We also had the fresh mozzarella cheese app, which was incredible!

The flatbreads were incredible! You could taste every fresh flavor item on the flatbread!

Service was good.. I thought sometimes a little to attentive, I am looking forward to going back!
