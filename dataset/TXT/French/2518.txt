0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g I really find most Vegas restaurants lackluster and like knock offs of the original which fail to impress in one way or another.  However, after eating at Picasso the other night my eyes have been opened to a restaurant in Vegas that knows how to execute a great meal.  We did the tasting menu with the wine pairing and the food and pairings were spot on.  The sommelier, Robert was interesting in the fact that he told you facts about the wine made the experience educational and fun.  I really liked the room, lighting and the paintings of course make it hard to not be impressed by.  My only complaint would be that sometimes the food was brought to the table and just put down without telling us the components. I hate that - but that was a very slight negative.
