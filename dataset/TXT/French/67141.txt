USleI8g1UVN9-9jm-b4uIg Get gussied up for a fancy night out! Perfect ambiance to impress your date or your guests in a charming old home. You did not see a sore face in the whole place - looking around you could see friends, families, colleagues all in good conversation...kind of felt like the background of a movie with everyone dressed up and having a nice evening. This is what fine dining is all about.

Let's talk dessert first and then go backwards. Save room for an order of beignets to share! Pair a bite or two of those with a toasted almond cappuccino and you can call it a night. For the main course, I ordered the sea scallops with a mixed salad. I love scallops and these were made well and melted like butter in my mouth. Hubs got the night special and although I can't remember what that was as I'm typing this, I do remember he slicked his plate clean.  

The service was great. We never felt rushed, they treated us like guests, and they were friendly.

From the moment we moved to Charlotte almost 6 years ago, we heard great things about this restaurant. Can't believe it took us so long, but so glad we did.
