SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA The food was fine. Authentic I suppose. I am perhaps spoiled having spent a large amount of time in France. I do understand the "bistro" style of this location. 
I will say that to be quite honest with you, very few if any of the cheeses were French. The fromagier had little idea about the cheeses and could not answer as to why they were not authentically French. This aside, I do understand that some cheeses may be difficult to get due to season, availability etc. However, the restaurant should not proclaim itself to be serving  authentic French cuisine of the blue cheese comes from Italy and there is Gouda on the menu.
