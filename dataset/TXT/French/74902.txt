I dined here once several years ago, and could have sworn it was French/Italian fusion, but the menu last Friday night was French.  Don't be intimidated by this, as there is something that everyone will enjoy.  

After a day spent moving furniture, mattresses, etc. (the joys of moving), we had worked up a SERIOUS appetite.  To begin, we split the carpaccio du jour, which came with balsamic onions and gorgonzola.  I love onions of all shapes and sizes, but cooked in balsamic? Oh man, oh man.  Scrumptious.  

I ordered the duck confit as my entree, which comes served with a side of flageolet beans and sausage.  These are a thinner, more delicate looking kidney bean, and I absolutely adored them.  The duck was tender and very good, but sadly I preferred the duck confit at Rooster's a bit more.  I like a more salted, briny flavor. 

I sampled the fish of the day which was a poached halibut that was flavorful and ever so healthy.

The restaurant has a definite European feel to it.  It is elegant and relaxed at the same time.  I would love to enjoy some lovely wine and appetizers on the patio before catching a flick at the Manor.  Sounds heavenly right...about...now...
