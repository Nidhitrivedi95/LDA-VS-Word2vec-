2gUbgbdJ7IFSbicBXlSchw Came in alone around 10pm looking to just relax with a good meal. 

The food was good but I felt very rushed. I didn't even get to finish my bone marrow when they took away my plate (after they asked three times if I was done I just relented.. They wouldn't let me take the rest home either). I mean, the restaurant was prob only a third full so I don't know what the rush was. 

The croque Monsieur was not good, don't get it. It was dry and look like someone just half heartedly slapped it together. 

Disappointing.
