7Ym8NVxTO9b1FLGeWGp_Fg Came for lunch on a weekday and they are pretty busy. There is prix menu for lunch that you can either pick 2 or 3 for appetizer (soup/salad), main, dessert. I had some appetizers and a black cod. Calamari tastes good but some only have batter without the calamari inside so I don't like it. Bone marrow with escargot is not bad but I had better at another Spanish restaurant. Also if they can give us more bread for the bone marrow then it'll be better. The black cod is good, very tasty, also comes with veggies that has chick pea and green. Food and price is decent for this type of restaurant
