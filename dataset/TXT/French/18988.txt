An_U8woQkFVsMqVblkImZQ Completely fantastic brunch. I had the roasted pear and cheddar omelette, which was a beautiful balance of flavors. My brunch mate had the sausage on cornbread, which was the perfect combination of spicy and sweet. Good service, beautiful building, and interesting teas were a bonus.
