For a Tuesday night, it was packed by 6pm. The service is slow as the wait staff/kitchen were inundated with 80% of the patrons ordering at the same time. We were given some nice bread and Olive Oil in Salt and Balsamic Vinegar as we were waiting.

We originally were coming here for the Beer and Burger Special which they no longer do..

As we were perusing the menu, the Happy Hour Menu caught our eye..

Buck a Shuck Oysters - so we ordered 3 dozen 

We also ordered some dinner off the menu:

Beef Short Rib Poutine - the Short Rib was flavorful and intense and the Fries was cruchy with well seasoned gravy and cheese curds

Pork Chop - the chop is nicely seared and not over cooked, the brussels sprout is nicely crisp on a bed of celiac puree and chutney.

Come in at 5pm to take advantage of the Happy Hour tapas and drinks.
