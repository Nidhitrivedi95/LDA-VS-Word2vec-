4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Amazing!!!!!! I'm a pretty hard person to please when it comes to steak and this was by far the BEST steak I have ever had!!!! The waiter and other staff was extremely friendly and the perfect amount of attentive!! The ambiance was really great with candles at the tables and dimmed lights. The steak was served with fritas, which I had never had and let me tell you were ahhhhhmazing. Everything about this place is five star and above the top.
We also went back for breakfast on the patio the next morning. It had a great view and once again didn't disappoint at all!!! Would highly recommend going here it's truly an amazing experience.
