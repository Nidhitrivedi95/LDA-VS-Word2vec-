Batifole is one of my favourite restaurants in the city that combines delicious, flavourful food with a wonderful welcoming atmosphere.  Every time I visit I end up ordering far too much and sit enjoying the food for hours while sipping delicious wine. 

The service is very good and friendly, although typically French.  There is no rush for servers to get drinks or clear plates but that is one of the things I enjoy.  It is the 'old way' of eating out where quality takes time but is well worth it ensuring a consistent, relaxed atmosphere even when the restaurant is full to the brim.  The chef/owner has always come out at the end of the meal to ensure it is enjoyed and to say hello.

Two of my favourite dishes are the veal chop and duck two ways.  Both are generous portions and even though I am not a meat lover in general I cannot help but finish the full plate every time.  If you are a chocolate fan you should not leave without having the chocolate lava cake served on a bed of caramel.  The cake is to die for - perfectly balanced, it is rich and sweet without being overwhelming. 

Please note that if you are in a rush, don't eat here - you would be doing the restaurant and yourself a disservice.  Batifole is where you go to savour and enjoy food at your leisure.
