SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ Pretty good. Not spectacular enough to come back. Maybe for HH. The service was meh! Waiter did not know the food nor the wine list. He was not upscale waiter material by any means, more like Keanu Reeves trying to serve. "Whoa, need some wine dude?" I Had to send him back to the chef to ask about food Ingredients . Had no idea. Thats no good when average prices for plates are around $25. Small portions for the price. I know it is upscale cuisine but I was starving after my $29 meal. The herbed butter with bread was too powerful. Should be a subtle flavor. It was good but not worth going back to IMO.
