rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A One of the best brunches hands down in Vegas.  The menu actually has quite a lot of selection with items ranging from ham and cheese and burgers to normal brunch options. We went with a burger with truffle fries and chicken and waffles. Accompanied with some champagne and fresh complimentary bread and pastries, the meal was great. 

It ran us about $85 in total for the 2 dishes, truffle upgrade, and drinks. Great meal but I wish the balcony was open. The atmosphere of the place was very laid back and service was top notch. This is definitely a higher end brunch in Vegas and prices reflect that.  Come here if money is no option. And pro tip: use all the sauces they provide; they're there for a reason and make for more complete dishes.
