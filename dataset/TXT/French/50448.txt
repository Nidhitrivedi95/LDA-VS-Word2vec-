ovtlrcsVRlgZZQUlHs_ovw After reading the reviews I was expecting more. The service was just OK. When I called to make a reservation I told them it was a special occasion - a birthday. They didn't bring a cupcake or make any attempt to make the meal special. No mention of anything. 

When we arrived, they said our table was ready. It was a 2 top in the middle of a bench type of set up and the restaurant was empty with only one other table occupied. We requested the table at the end of the bench but I still was not happy with that option. My fault for not speaking up better. If you are not a regular I'd say expect to inferior seating. 

The sides were inexpensive but they wanted $29.95 for the sea bass. That's higher than a 5 star restaurant in LA. I opted for the salmon which was about $10 less and just ok. It looked like what I get from Trader Joe's. 

Next time I'm driving to Scottsdale for a more fine dining experience.
