C3PVq7UpeHd6nz1_e-AtkA I've been meaning to try this place out for years. Last night (a Friday) we stopped in without a reservation shortly after 8:30pm. There would have been a 30-40 minute wait for a table inside, but luckily there was room on the patio and the weather was just tolerable enough to do it so we gave it a go.

I ordered a Nannette to start, which was essentially a mini pizza on naan bread. I ordered one and was brought another which to be honest I didnt even notice until the waitress pointed out the mistaken ingredients. It was pretty bland flavours (I was saying halfway through how it need a sauce or something to give it some flavour) and broccoli that didnt seem cooked enough. The thing is looking back at the menu now, there is no Nannette with broccoli so Im guessing I got someones custom ordered item, so I cant really blame them for the taste as I can the service of the mixup. It was still tolerably good enough to not complain anyways. My date started with the mussels which were good but brought out without a side dish for shells until we asked for one. Another hit against the service.

For mains, my date had the lobster ravioli and only had good things to say. I had the lamb chops which were covered in a mango chutney, and served alongside sweet potato mashed and vegetables. I'm not used to such an overwhelmingly high amount of sweetness complimenting the lamb I eat but this did work quite well. My only complaint is that the lamb chops were more on the medium rare side than medium as ordered. 

Their dessert menu looked great but we were stuffed full already and called it a dinner. In the end, 4 drinks 2 starters and 2 mains came to just over $110 after tax before tip.

I'd come back again as the place was good and Im curious to try their 'Scrolls', although next time make reservations as this place seems to stay busy and if it were any warmer I doubt we would've even gotten our spot on the patio.
