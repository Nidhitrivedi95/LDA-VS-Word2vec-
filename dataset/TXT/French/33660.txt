hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA I'm having a hard time writing this review because just thinking about Olivier and his wonderful croissants makes this girl blush. I think it's a combination of the owner's French appeal and the flaky, buttery goodness of the pastries.  It's undeniable... Baguette Café makes my heart flutter.

Everything they offer from the pastries to the soups made daily is made from fresh ingredients. You can just taste it. On my first visit, I had the prosciutto sandwich and cream of mushroom soup. I expected for the baguette to be hard and crunchy but that wasn't the case at all. I took a bite and it was crunchy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside. On my next visit, I had the chipotle chicken panini and cream of potato and leek soup. Everything was divine. They are good lunch portions and affordable at around $6-$7. 

The service and ambiance is 5 stars all the way. You can tell that Olivier appreciates all of his patrons because he tries to get to know everyone by name. He takes the time to explain everything that is on the menu. He is so enthusiastic and passionate about the food that he makes everything sound irresistible. His French accent doesn't hurt either. True to his word, the food is every bit as delicious as he describes.

Unfortunately for me, they are only open Monday-Friday from 7 am to 5 pm. I have actually considered quitting my job so that I can get another job in the business complex where they are located. And then I could have Baguette Café for breakfast, lunch and dinner! No, that's crazy right? Darn you Olivier and your croissants for putting these ideas in my head!
