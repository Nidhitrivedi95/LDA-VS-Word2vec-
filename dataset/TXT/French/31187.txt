ggIWkJtgXHKnhdxRu338AQ Atmosphere, service and food were great. 

Came here for Summerlicious 2012. Price was $20 for lunch. 

Cant beat the location- right in the heart of Yorkville in a nice little courtyard. We sat in the patio and people watched. Service was friendly though it got busy and the wait staff seemed overwhelmed. The best part though was the food. I rated it as follows:

Salmon Tartare - 5/5 - wow
Stuffed Salmon - 4/5
Parfait - 4/5

THe portions were substantial (although, friends who had the bass entree thought it was like half a portion) and priced well considering the location and quality. 

This is a place I'd consider coming back to even after Summerlicious.
