rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I've done brunch here multiple times and dinner here once. I much prefer brunch. Mimosas, quiche with some greens, a glass of Sancerre, some oysters, delicious bread and butter. A dream brunch for me. My wife goes for sourdough waffles or French toast with bacon and mimosas throughout the meal. The perfect way to start the day in Vegas.

Dinner is a wonderful experience and can actually be quite affordable in comparison to many other places we like to go, or you can go all out. Wonderful wine list given that I prefer old world wines in general, and they have a full range of prices so it's not intimidating if you have a budget, but if you aren't holding back you can grab a great bottle. I wouldn't pass up the terrines, pates, and other classic charcuterie if available. I also suggest digging into the oysters. The quality is incredible. 

Brunch or dinner, Highly Recommended.
