_cjPEH9wXhKS-HQe_U3M4Q Made reservations for weekend brunch! Place was pretty packed and very Frech-style like. I definitely consider it a relaxing, romantic brunch spot.

Got the eggs benny (like usual) and a latte. Complimentary bread was delicious and our food came fairly quicky considering how busy it was. Eggs benny wasn't bad, but the asparagus and mushrooms made the perfect compliment.
