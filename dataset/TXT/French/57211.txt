rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A This was by far my favorite dinner while in Vegas. Not the most expensive (Picasso). Not the coolest decor (Tao). But easily the best time I had for a meal. We lucked out and veteran server Michael took care of us for the evening. We were able to get a private dining room after our party got larger on short notice. They accommodated us without issue. 

Back to Michael. He has been with Bouchon since it opened 12 years ago, and it is perfectly evident that his time with this establishment has been well spent and fruitful. He know the menus like the back of his hand. Not only does he know the food and drink, he knows the history of the food and drink. He knows what to suggest and what not to suggest based on all factors. That level of expertise is hard to find these days, and it was supremely appreciated by all in the party.

I went with the Steak Frites just to have a classic, time tested dish. It was billed as a 9 oz flat iron. I did not know what cut that was so I inquired, and he said it was around the neck of the cow. I still didn't know enough to get an idea so I obliged. Flat iron renders an image in my head of thin streak in my head, but when they brought it out, it was a thick cut. At least an inch. The density/fat content of the meat reminded me of a sirloin, but it was incredibly tender and flavorful. Michael suggested medium for the cut, and it was perfect.
