el-3IdlW3bTCSnquLvH-3w What a great experience for breakfast!  We'll be back for French Onion Soup, maybe Beef Bourguignon.  The french toast was terrific -- fruit was extremely generous, I had a strawberry slice in every bite.  Just enough whipped cream, not too much.  SO had the quiche, it too was fantastic.  Coffee was also tasty, only thing preventing 5 stars is we're used to fresh cream or half and half at places of this caliber, got the room temperature stable stuff instead.  Place was very quiet, lots of natural light, staff very friendly and attentive.
