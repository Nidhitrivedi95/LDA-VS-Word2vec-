zw4Legbcu018p5WcZ74iWA Lost my poutine virginity here...loved it! Could be eating their poutine all day long, but particularly great if you're looking for comfort food after a cold, tiring day. Burger was awesome as well - small, simple but delicious. The whole meal + a drink was only $12 CAD. Would come back for the tofu burger another day.
