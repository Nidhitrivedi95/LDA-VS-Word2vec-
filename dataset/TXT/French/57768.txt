rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A This place was a gem, literally.
It's hidden in Venetian, guest room 10th floor.
Wait wasn't too long, but only walk ins are allowed for brunch so make sure you snack before going.

I had the infamous croquet madame.
It was deliciously moist and the fries were awesome.
Not the best comparison, but everyone knows how Mcdonald fries are hard to resist... it tasted just like it, with the exception this was made from real potatoes.

My bf got the corned hash, which was hearty and filling. Friend had lobster benedict, a special of the day.  She approved, which is hard to come by.  Her husband had the dish where you have a little of everything, eggs, pastry, drink, and breakfast meat... we wouldn't recommend it as it was just so plain compared to other fabulous dishes you can gorge on.  Sticky cinnamon pecan bun was nutty and the orange juice tasted freshly squeezed.

Awesome brunch place! A must visit spot.
