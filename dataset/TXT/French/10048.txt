I had the skate wing. It was cooked so it was a little golden brown. I enjoyed the subtle crunch when I bit down. The chewy texture on the interior was interesting. Not bad but not spectacular. Next time I'll come with a date, order steak frites, and sit out on the patio to enjoy the fountain show.
