Kut9tVbDX_f7qKMRRoXg3w Errrrmaaaaghhhherd. Do not pass go. Do not collect $200 (canadian) dollars. Just get the charcuterie. I can't be responsible for what happens after that. 

We stopped in this little spot because sommmmeone (me) has a teeny bladder. Also, because it was a butcher shop and my BF is obsessed with meat. While i ran into the bathroom at warp speed, he ordered us a beverage and the charcuterie plate. What arrived stunned me. It wasn't a plate - it was a platter. A platter full of the most amazing meats ever. 

Foie Gras that was so buttery and incredible I can scarcely believe it. That was just the tip of the iceberg/mountain of meat. Two kinds of pate, proscuitto, pancetta, a shreddy thing, roast beef, salami, some other meat spread I couldn't identify but immediately ate and cornichones and mustard of course.

In the end, one of the servers promoted this ice wine to us. His claims were spot on about how complementary it was... but at $20 a glass, we felt a little cheated. That's pricey even for Montreal and it seems like something he should have mentioned. A good stop in experience for us based on the charcuterie plate alone. Skip the ice wine. It's nice - but not that nice.
