XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q It has been too long since I went (Valentine's Day) to write a proper review and account for everything, so right now I can only talk about what I still remember: the highlights.  The bread cart is awe-inspiring.  There were four types of brioche alone, as well as every other type of bread you could dream of.  The brioche, by the way, melts in your mouth, morsel by morsel.  Our appetizer/amuse bouche was a citrus flan/sangria flavored concoction, which emitted its own dry-ice fog, as if it were a present from a forest nymph.  

I had the lobster and artichoke salad, which was tender and light, the chesnut soup with foie gras and bacon froth, which is just as it sounds (clean, deep with flavor and amazing), and then the spiny lobster with yuka root in green curry.  The only issue I had was that the spiny lobster in curry was a little salty.  For dessert, I ordered the chocolate souffle because that is my favorite thing in the whole world, and the only place besides Les Souffles in Paris that can make a good one in the States is Gary Danko.  By this point, we were way too full to possibly enjoy the souffle, and they even went so far as to roll around the dessert cart with 50 some desserts on it, so we first sampled those (they're all good), and then they gave us sorbets because the souffle was taking a long time.  I felt like I was having a heart attack trying to spoon the rich chocolate souffle with gooey chocolate liquid inside into my mouth.  It's delicious, don't get me wrong, but I don't recommend getting any dessert; the cart is plenty.  

The service was just impeccable, I couldn't help but clap or laugh whenever they brought out a new thing, it was magical, romantical!  Best restaurant I've been to in America, even better than French Laundry, dare I say it?  It was the bread cart. :*)
