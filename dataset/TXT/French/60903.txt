SD7vTf-H00J8BS3L-kt7jg I have been to Grinder before just for drinks but last night was the first time I ate there. Nice cocktail menu. The Pimm's Royale was really nice. My friends ordered the oysters to start with and they said they were fresh and delicious. The staff was reasonably knowledgable and helpful with any questions we had regarding the wine, cocktails and the food. I ordered the burger not expecting it to be anything wonderful but to my surprise it really was delicious! You get a nice number of options for the side dish. I had the seasonal vegetables. It was a nice mix of kale, cauliflower, cheese, pecans and almonds. Really nice dish to accompany my very nice burger topped with cheese and bacon. For dessert I ordered the cheescake with a mango topping in a raspberry coolis. It wasn't exactly a NY style dense cheescake. Was more like a mousse but still really good and after a burger, probably a lot better than a heavy cheesecake. All in all I thought the food was better and more satisfying than most of these "cool" Montreal hotspots and I'm looking forward to returning.
