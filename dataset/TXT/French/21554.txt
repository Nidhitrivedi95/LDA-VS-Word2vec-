bEVWHtBRYVwqaaNF4mWNYg something about the line of wishful cougars in the bathroom makes me think this potential whimsical bistro is the local ladies' pick-up joint. no fear. i only noticed them on the way in, through the bar, and downstairs in the loo.
in back dining room (there's two), couples or small groups are able to enjoy conversation that is audible in spite of a hectic hum of many tables... all in good company. the seats are somewhat low and ceilings are somewhat high; thus, making for ideal setting for a first date (read: 20 questions sans romance). 
the menu is offers just the right amount of selection from french foods. all tasty enough, though a touch slow arriving at the table*.
i found the price points to be very reasonable. in fact, if the service was a better trained at fine dining, i would say it's a deal. while staff was friendly and knowledgeable, a little formal training and less cougar loiterers could really bring this place up to its potential.
if said potential was met, the "slow" food time might be more reasonably justified as a warm, cozy, date restaurant (vs the mid-life / identity crisis diner it seems to be now).
