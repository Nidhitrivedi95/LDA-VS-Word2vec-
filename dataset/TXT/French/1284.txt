_T7f2wUgNlJqxsR-cR89SQ I've been to many different restaurant, and have tried many different foods. But this just might be the best meal I ever had. Very expensive, but very worth it. The explosion of flavors in the dressing/sauces, the succulent meats, the perfectly prepared vegetables, literally everything about this place was outstanding.
