ovtlrcsVRlgZZQUlHs_ovw Went with the wife due to being a block away and heard so many great things about this place.  The restaurant was very classy in appearance.  The menu nice and simple which I prefer.  I ordered a sidecar and the wife a lemonade which were both amazing.  The food was very lackluster and reminded me of Dennys but 4 times the price.  I had the vogue steak which cam bland an unseasened.  The sauce needed more time to reduce and tasted bland as well.  The steak tasted as if it was frozen and not fresh.  The wife had the vogue burger which tasted much better then my steak but had too many things going on.  Everything got lost and it was terribly overwhelming and unenjoyable.  The table next to us seemed like regulars and order drinks with a cheese tray.  I think if we were to return we will follow suit and leave the food to someone else.
