YDb78yqVp5Dyx7zVr4POvA I have to agree, this new French-influenced restaurant in Victoria Quay really deserves high praise, and is great news to those of us still mourning the loss of Daniel's Bistro a few years back. It used to be a pretty mediocre Mexican joint, where I once got a bowl of chilli before the cinema but never went back to, but this whole experience couldn't be more different. 

The decor's great - very light and stylish, and not at all intimidating. The same can be said of the friendly and attentive staff, who really bent over backwards to make our meal (a 91st birthday party) feel really special.

I played it safe and went for the burger, and was rewarded with a rich, perfectly seasoned hunk of meat, wonderfully charred on the outside while pink and moist in the centre. The accompanying fries and salad would also easily have passed muster across the channel.

The others in my party were a little more adventurous, choosing from the good range of fish, meat and (say it quietly) vegetarian options, and everyone came away feeling they'd made the best choice. Surely a good sign.
