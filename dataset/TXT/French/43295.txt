LtDYRcMJbJPhXPEklT29Fw A fantastic experience is all aspects.   We were not sure what to expect, as we knew the staff were all ex-cons, however we could not have been more pleasantly surprised.  The wait staff was certainly not the polished staff of other places, but they were VERY friendly, and aimed to please.   

The biggest treat was the food.  One of the best French meals I have had in a long time.  We had the escargot appetizer, and the main courses were grouper and scallop.  Both were to die for.  Finished a bananas foster served tablesize.

Atmosphere was very nice, and drink menu also extremely creative.   I would highly recommend Edwn's to anyone, and we look forward to returning.
