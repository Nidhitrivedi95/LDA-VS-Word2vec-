I had heard so many good things from friends about this place that I was excited to eat here but ended up disappointed. It was a slow Tuesday night and our server disappeared for long enough periods that we joked that he must have gone on a break. 

I ordered the roasted lamb with charred eggplant. The lamb, cooked medium-rare was well-prepared but could have used more seasoning.The size of the dish, however, was more suitable for the kid's menu. We also had the bouillabaisse. That was amazing and definately worth tasting. For dessert, the Caramel Mousse is a can't miss.If I go back it would be for dessert and I would sit in the lounge and sip water--a Dogfish IPA was $12!!
