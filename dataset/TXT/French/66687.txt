uP3H5bcsiTXM0k0xQhRndg It is a small family owned restaurant. Yes there is an average 35-40 mins wait to get in the door even for a party of 3 and they don't take reservations. I would not suggest this place if you are coming with a large group. Spacing and tables are small but they did say that they are working on a new location.  Our waitress and hostess were great, they were attentive and courteous the entire time.
Unfortunately I cannot say the same thing for the food. Coming to this restaurant I was expecting to see french dishes on the menu. Most items were some sort version of American food. I ordered Mac and Cheese which I think it should not be called Mac and Cheese if there is no cheese in it, they used cream instead with lots coarse salt, bread crumbs and shredded beef on top which tasted terrible. In my opinion, If you are going to change the recipe for a classic dish such as this one, you need to go above and beyond with it. Pork Belly was done well but it came with 2 sauces covering the entire plate, and literally mixing with each other. Less sauce on the plate please. And Salmon was plain old salmon, nothing special. 

Overall I was very disappointed with the food. I would highly recommend changing your menu.
