Dcj69NZJnbJhK-YHP_nULA My favorite restaurant. The apple and Swiss sandwich is delicious. I have been trying to replicate it at home and have yet to perfect the aioli and pesto. The frites and salad are also a must! They have different aiolis that they serve with the frites. Huge beer selection as well.
