AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw my first visit to Payard was last december...i went for the prix fixe dinner...which is a three course dessert for dinner deal. for the price it wasn't bad and the service was great. they started us off with a savory amuse. the desserts i had were great, too. i raved and raved to my friends when i got back, so on this most recent trip my friend and i went to payard bistro hoping to experience the prix fixe dessert for dinner, only to find out that they were no longer offering dinner at all! just breakfast and lunch, to our dismay. but since it was lunch time, my friend and i gave it a whirl.

we started off by sharing a caesar salad...had anchovies and a poached egg. it was by far one of the best caesar salads i've had. i followed that with eggs benedict on a croissant instead of an english muffin. it was so light and tasty...i'm a big fan of eggs benedict in general but usually get weighed down with the hollandaise sauce, but the hollandaise at payard had a big zing of citrus which just made it that much better for me. my friend had the braised short ribs and she liked that as well. we both followed it up with dessert...i mean, come on, it's a patisserie...of course you have to have dessert! i had the beaux arts, a cassis mousse, and my friend had the louvre, a chocolate and hazelnut mousse concoction. both were great and can also be purchased at the walk up counter right next door.

after we were done with lunch, we popped in over to the walk up counter and got a "picasso" truffle...dark chocolate infused with earl grey tea. a perfect ending.
