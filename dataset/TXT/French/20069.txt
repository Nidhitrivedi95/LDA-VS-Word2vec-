aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw Made a quick stop in Bouchon Bakery as we we're walking around the Strip

Suddenly a craving for a macaron was upon me & who am I to argue such a sugary-pull?

Got the Pistachio & it was hard & chewy - no tender pillow of deliciousness.  Disappointed

Mr got the Banana Walnut Muffin & it was stale.  Dry & tasted old, he threw over 1/2 of it away

Maybe if we had been to the larger bakery inside the Venetian, we might have fared better, but this little kiosk at the clock tower has been neglected

Sadness........
