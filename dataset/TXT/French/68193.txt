vg55SAkrEmuHpWfIMtJjBQ Legume is all that everyone has written about it.  I won't repeat much here except to say that the food and service are the BEST I've ever experienced in Pittsburgh.   I've been three times in the last two months and have enjoyed every new dish I've ordered.   

What continues to amaze me is how reasonably priced it is.   Far better food and service than ANY other restaurant in town and yet priced most other fine dining establishments.

My ONLY complaint: it's always so damn WARM in the place.   Tonight was especially uncomfortable.  Maybe it's to appease the senior citizen clientele?   Don't know.  I just wish they'd crank up the AC a bit.
