xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g This place it probably the best place to have a date night in Las Vegas. Right above the Bellagio fountains with full view of the strip. Breathtaking spot. 
The restaurant, is very well appointed with coourtoues staff welcoming guest. We were direct to corner table - best in the room. 
Now the food - we started with sharing an appetizer, Hot glazed crab - it  was so well presented, on the taste it was a bit shy, for me, but I am wholesome flavor dinner. 
For entree, we ordered the lamb chops, which comes with point noir infused sauce and my wife ordered the snapper - both of them were just divine. Lamb chops were hands down the best I have had in Las Vegas - well done, with perfect bland of marinade and jus. Outstanding. My wife loved the snapper too -and now the best part. the dessert - we ordered the chocolate plate - it was crazy delicious - a mix n match of best chocolate offering in the restaurant - A must have. All this was enjoyed with great French red. 
Now the service, our waiter was excellent, he new his job - very attentive and made the right suggestions.
Overall a strong 5 stars for the entire experience - its a awesome date night dinner spot - great service, top-quality food and million dollar views
