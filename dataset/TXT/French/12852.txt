4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Fast service and great food. We were seated right away for table of two. They gave us bread with this wonderful tasting butter. I order the egg Benedict and my husband ordered the French toast. Both were very good. Food came out really fast given that the restaurant was packed. Service was great!! Will come back.
