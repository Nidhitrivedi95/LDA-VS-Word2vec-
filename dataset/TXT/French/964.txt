_cjPEH9wXhKS-HQe_U3M4Q I was excited to try Le Select. I don't get to try French cuisine too often and since I heard many good things about this place, I was raring to go. Now this is beginning to sound like an intro to a bad review? Well, not THAT bad. The place definitely looks chic. We went for lunch, and I could imagine it looked prettier at night. Service was awesome - quick, helpful, friendly.

I ordered the grilled salmon with hollandaise sauce - picture pretty. But it really tasted overcooked, too salty and really nothing special. The rest of our table seemed pleased with theirs though - one had duck confit, another had the salad with goat cheese. Maybe just my plate had problems?

Unfortunately, I won't try it again to find out.
