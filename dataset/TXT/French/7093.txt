4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Excellent service! We were able to get a reservation a few minutes before on a Sunday Memorial Day weekend.  We sat on the patio overlooking the Bellagio water show.  The food was outstanding and the kids meal were cheap and good!  We ordered the crepes with ham and cheese and jumbo crab cake (pretty small ...not jumbo) and it was all fresh and tasty.  The restaurant is huge and they are pretty well organized although we waited more than half hour for our food...worth the wait. Will definitely be back soon!
