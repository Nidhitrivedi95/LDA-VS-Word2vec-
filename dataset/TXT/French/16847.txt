8xCiibfgqy-8xpCWEaguqg Came here with co-workers this evening. We were seated right away by a friendly hostess and within 2 minutes of sitting our waiter was there asking for drink orders. That was the theme for the evening as service was very fast (a little too fast as our entrees came to the table while we were still eating our apps). I had the sea bass as my main course and it was beautifully cooked. The quinoa salad was ok but the asparagus was too pungent with garlic. My dinner companions seemed to  like their meals: prime rib and New York steak along with the sides. Dessert was a hit with huge servings of billy miner pie (this is a sharing size). The atmosphere was a plus. Cozy and comfortable with a reasonable level of noise that allowed for easy conversation.
