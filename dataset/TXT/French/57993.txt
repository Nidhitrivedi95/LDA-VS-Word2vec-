rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Last night was my 2nd visit to Bouchon and as the previous visit, it did not disappoint.  Bouchon is Thomas Keller's Las Vegas French Bistro.  Moderately priced food, prepared with style, care and quality ingredients. The service was excellent.   

The atmosphere is grand, the impressive zinc bar really gives the place the character of a Parisian Brasserie.  The feel reminds me of Le Couple.  It's not an intimate place, there's a feeling of activity, hustle and bustle.  It's tucked in a lower corner of the Venetian Hotel so if going, give yourself some time to find it.  

We ordered the salad of greens and warm goat cheese.  The mixed greens were fresh and delicate with a red wine vinaigrette it was superb.  I ordered the salmon as my main course.  It was cooked perfectly and had a delicious crispy skin.  It came with some buckwheat crepes or galettes which were a nice compliment to the salmon and smoked salmon beurre blanc.  We also ordered the Poulet Roti, a generous portion of chicken, nice and tender served with a puffed pastry.  We enjoyed a cote du rhone village which I thought was reasonable in price.  

The french fries or frites are a must try at Bouchon.  I witnessed countless orders of them being served so we ordered some for ourselves.  These golden sticks of potatoes were perfectly crisp on the outside and soft on the inside.  Not a hint of greasiness and with just the right amount of salt. Our cone of fries was empty by the end of the night.

For dessert, we shared an apple bread pudding with ice cream and a calvados sauce. We loved it.  For some reason they also brought us a complimentary dessert sampler plate with a scrumptious assortment of treats.  We managed to finish off those too.

There's no shortage of great food spots in Las Vegas.  Bouchon will give you an authentic grand bistro experience and leave you some $$ for the tables.
