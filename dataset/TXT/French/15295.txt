6fPQJq4f_yiq1NHn0fd11Q Shared the "cinnamon bun" crepe.  It was a proper crepe thickness, but I felt it was overfilled.  They definitely added a massive amount of frosting to it!  Thankfully the accompanying whipped cream wasn't overly sweet.

It was great at first bite, but less so as it was consumed.  The sugar really catches up to you!  I regretted not getting a water.

Probably somewhat overpriced, but service was fast, and they didn't put too much ice in my dining companion's Pepsi.
