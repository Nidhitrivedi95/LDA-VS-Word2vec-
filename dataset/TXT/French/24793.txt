COgwFthJpS4We16W5Gf4lw Undoubtably the best place to dine in las Vegas!  The fettuccini  is the best I have ever tasted. The service (Keifer) is amazing. This establishment personifies quality dining and service. It is quiet enough that one can carry on a conversation, one never feels rushed and the food is amazing! The best!
