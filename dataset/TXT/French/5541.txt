3jKUbhGSjFTv5jZ0wnW0xA Went on a Friday night and the restaurant was kinda quiet, although it was 9 pm. For me, it was still quiet considering it is the weekend. Had the french onion soup. Yum! My friend had the escargot. I think it was a little too salty. As for main dishes, my friend had duck confit and I had lamb shank. The lamb fell off the bone. Tender and juicy! wonderful! The duck was good as well, I only had one bite, but she told me her dish was good too. For dessert, we had the lava cake. The cake part didn't have much taste. Not impressed. Service was good. The waiter was friendly and checked on us a good amount, no complaints there. Yes, I would come back.
