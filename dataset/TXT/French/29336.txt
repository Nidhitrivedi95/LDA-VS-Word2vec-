Despite calling itself a  French Restaurant, there are in fact very few "French " items - since when is Fried Chicken, Korean Ribs, or Waldorf Salad French cuisine? Be very,very skeptical of glowing reviews of this place - they are not likely to be genuine. The food was mediocre, either overcooked, or cold. The best thing I can say about this place, is that you can get your cheque quickly. Not worth the time, effort, or money.
