It really works!

After cruising around first by car(the cobblestones really do a number on the spine and suspension), and then on foot, we ventured up and down, in and out of the hilly streets to really get a feel for what was going on here.  It was very rewarding, despite the 90+ heat on a crystal clear blue sky day with low humidity. When we reached Place Jacques Cartier, and checked all the cafes lining the square, as well as the street entertainers, we opted for the shady side, as did most other folks.  We were seated at a deuce toward the back of the large front outdoor green canopied deck, where we could resuscitate from the heat with a drink, watch all the other people watchers, and have a bite of French cuisine.   

The traditional Soupe Onione a la Grantinee was all I needed, along with a hydrating tall glass of water, and a local pilsner.  My friends had a variety of fresh salads, croissant sandwiches, and an awesome looking burger.  75 minutes later we were sated and looking for a place to nap.  L'Adventure was exactly what we wanted, and it did not disappoint.  Service was fine. 

 I love that everyone is bilingual, but greet in French and easily slip into English as we reply to the "Bonjour, Bonjour."

Next stop: Chinatown.
