Yp9w4nhUowBU_IS_StFXbQ Decent breakfast but definitely way overpriced for such stingy portions.

Wasabi Bloody Mary = Good Bloody Mary but couldn't really taste the wasabi.

Seared Foie Gras = Decently seared foie gras, which went amazing (as all foie gras does) with my breakfast. Yeah, don't judge, I'm from California so I'm eating foie gras whenever I get a damn chance.

Three-Egg Omelet = Standard, small omelet. 

Nice ambiance for a Sunday brunch (especially with all the sunlight), but the food just wasn't great enough to really recommend.
