There is a ton of selection and everything is different. it was super cheap. for 2 sandwiches was like $14 which makes it cheaper than eating at subway. When I left I left thinking about what I wanted to order next time I came back. it was very good street food. The sandwiches are messy and hard to eat which makes them perfect for walking around and snacking. 

the place seemed clean, user friendly, and very cost effective. I would highly recommend
