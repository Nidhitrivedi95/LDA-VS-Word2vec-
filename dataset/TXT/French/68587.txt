vLkKorA1gPS97Zj0_WKA0Q When I die, I will be asking for Twist on my death bed.

My spouse and I recently took a culinary tour of Las Vegas. We ate out 2-3 meals a day, and each meal was pre-planned and exhaustively researched. Nothing could have prepared us for the Twist experience. 

Before our entrees arrived, we were presented with an assortment of amuse bouche that included parmesan croutons, chicken with paprika and beet sauce, nori-wrapped butterfish with a green apple gelee, goat cheese tartlets and an  incredible tuna foam with tiny lavash sticks. 

I ordered the organic salmon, which was perfectly prepared and served with a mix of aromatic herbs, a fondue of chicory, shitake and celery, and a small dish of fennel ice cream with a cucumber gelee and sweet potato puree. The latter was unlike anything I've ever tasted before- incredibly rich and savory for an ice cream. I also ordered the zezette broth (herbs, coconut milk, gnocchi and vegetables) a la carte, which was a wise decision, as it ended up being my favorite part of the evening.

My spouse had the venison filet, which was garnished with juniper berries, black peppercorns and black radish. His was served with salsify and a Grand Veneur ice cream that he described as "incomparable." 

For dessert, I had the lemon cake, which, while still delightful, was my least favorite dish. The cake itself was just a bit too dry/dense for my taste; although the accompanying green apple sorbet was delicious. 

Our check arrived with another tray of small bites: candied blueberries on friend spaghetti skewers, blueberry cookies and a pistachio nougat that was to die for. 

Service was exceptional. Ladies chairs were held for them whenever the need to stand arose; hooks were provided for purses, and I was even offered water for the flowers I had been carrying when we arrived. The atmosphere is quiet and extraordinarily beautiful. We will make a point of returning to Twist every time we visit Las Vegas.
