SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA Plus one and I went to L'Albatros before going to see a play at MOCA. I have never been there before, Plus One had lunch there once. We got to L'Albatros at 6pm without reservations, we were seated right away at a booth in the bar area. Happy hour ends 6:30pm, on the happy hour menu there was five drinks and 6 food items. We shared an entree, Mussels with Pomme Frites. Delicious!! The staff was friendly enough. Constantly getting refills on water and bread. I would go back again, hopefully get dessert next time.
