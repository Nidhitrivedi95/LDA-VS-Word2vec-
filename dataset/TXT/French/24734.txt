COgwFthJpS4We16W5Gf4lw Made a reservation for bf's birthday and I was disappointed for the following reasons:
1). Spoke with Jean Pierre and specifically requested the cozy alcove and he stated that if I came in earlier than my original time (7:00 pm) then it would be possible to obtain that area. Upon coming in, those tables were booked and the other section of the restaurant was having issues with the ac unit. So, we ended up in the main area, very cozy with others, which was fine, I suppose. 
2). We both opted for the 5 course prix fix dinner, and the first course was a basket of veggies, took them approx. 10-15 minutes to get it, when the table next to us received theirs within a few minutes. They forgot, and the waiter finally realized we were still waiting. Fine, got our veggie basket and bread, which was mediocre, saving grace was the capers, mixed with anchovies, which was a great compliment to the bread. 
3). Bf ordered the beef with pomm frites, the meat was chewy and nothing to rave about. My salmon with veggies tasted better, and it wasn't as dry as the steak. 
4).I specifically spoke to Jean requesting a cake or dessert with a candle at the end of our dinner, which he agreed to, but sadly, we received our desserts sans candle. Although bf was happy not to sing the birthday song, I was upset because all my requests were not met!

Overall, food presentation was nice, service was meh, but the cozy dim-lit room was romantic. Would I want to go back? Probably not. I will compare and see if this truly  is an authentic French restaurant when we travel to France!
