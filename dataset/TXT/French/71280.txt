xcmmTXhuMx2fZF2Bt69F4w Back one more time to see if anything had changed since an earlier visit this month.  Sadly, no.  The mussel sauce/curry was still good but the mussels remained totally uninteresting, unremarkable, and puny.  Really, the smallest mussels I've ever seen.

Service was okay but honestly, one finds much better service at Ciopinno's or other trendy places.  Point Brugge seems to be wedging itself into the slot that only the local folk find interesting.  For us, it is not longer a "go to" or destination venue.  Much better places up in the Wexford area for seafood.  

Just not a "show off Pittsburgh" place .....  Save your money, eat elsewhere.  Someone says this is one of Pittsburgh finest place.  Absolutely not -- NOLA on its worst day if so much better in service, food, and ambiance.  

f8 and be there.
