4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Came here for a bachelorette party dinner. Straight off, they were extremely accommodating in holding our reservation since it took us a bit longer than expected to get ready. As one would expect from such a restaurant, the service was exceptional. Our waiter was courteous and had a sense of humor. He also made sure we got our food and check in time for us to make our plans later in the evening. 
Food was amazing as well. All of the steaks were delicious and the French onion soup was incredible. Definitely stop by when you're in town.
