4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw The location inside the Paris restaurant is a great Strip location.  The patio is where to be.  You can see a great view of the Bellagio fountains, however some of the trees across Las Vegas Blvd. hinder the the view of the water show.  It's a great place to dine to people watch or to just get down on the food.  I ordered a fish dish the sole (off the valentines day menu), and my friend ordered the signature filet w/merlot butter sauce which came with frites (more like soft potato-ish chips).  The steak was amazing.  very juicy and tender and the sauce was to die for.  For an appetizer we had the scallops which were my favorite and also had the jumpo shrimp which was so-so.  Wines were good and service was great!  I would def go back and dine there again.  The prices aren't too bad, dinner entrees from $17-31.
