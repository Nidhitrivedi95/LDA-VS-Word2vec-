KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA Met my 2 friends here for our annual Christmas lunch. I have lived in Las Vegas 42 years. This was the worst restaurant I have ever been to. Every level disappointed. My friends quiche was a little pie similar to frozen pot pies you buy in the grocery store only smaller. It was uncooked and pastry was raw. My $24. pasta with only a bit of tomato sauce, was despicable. 
Our waiter was so rude as well. We had to ask twice for the bread. If you want to totally be ripped off go ahead and try this deplorable place. I left starving and so upset that we had chosen what we thought would be a real treat. I find it hard to 



believe they are still in business. All 3 of us work at major strip resorts and will certainly spread the word to steer clear of this horrible restaurant.
