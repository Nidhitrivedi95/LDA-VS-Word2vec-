My husband ordered the Roasted Cod with some apprehension about the cornichon aioli, but it was not overly rich and creamy.  It was an excellent blend of flavors--cheese, mild sauerkraut, spatzle, creme fraiche and aioli. Our party of four was delighted with our entire experience and highly recommend L'Albatross.
