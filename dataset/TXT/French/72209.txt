XKPosZx2j4RHcZ8Ewdwj0A I came here on my birthday with my wife and two kids.  I'm officially the only one I've ever heard of who has come here before 10pm (other than for brunch).

The grown-ups got a bottle of private-import cremant that was really yummy.  We got the fois gras au torchon for the table, and it was good, but not spectacular.

Our little guy had house-smoked salmon and a side of frites, and they were both fantastic.  He's a small eater, so fortunately we all got to share.

Our bigger guy started with the salmon tartare with truffle oil, which was really delicious, but very intense and a lot of it, so he couldn't finish it, even with some help -- I can't imagine this as a main.  His main was the magret, which was tough for him to cut and chew;  I wished I'd been able to talk him into the short rib (partly because I wanted to try it!).

Pour entree, I had the blood pudding, and it lived up to its reputation (I've heard it's the best in Montreal), although I can't imagine this one as a main either, would just be too much.  I followed that with the duck confit, which was the best I've ever had.

My wife had the fish soup, which was super good, and the roasted black cod, which was probably the best dish of all, although it (alone) was a small portion.

The atmosphere is great, the service was flawless, they were fine with our having kids there at 8pm (thoughtfully hid us away in a corner), and honestly I'd give it only 4 stars but I can't figure out how to justify a deduction, so, whatever, 5 stars it is!  I gotta try that short rib next time.
