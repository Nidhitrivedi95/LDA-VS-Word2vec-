But what was extremely good and I'll never forget is the fresh squeezed orange and grapefruit juice I had! Five stars for that! The guy we ordered from recommended it and it was the first time I was ever offered to have both mixed together. I wish I could have another glass right now. It wasn't too sweet and wasn't too sour and was just the perfect refresher after the long walk we'd had.
