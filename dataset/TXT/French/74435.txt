xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g Had company in town and a gift certificate I had won, so we went for Sunday lunch.  FABULOUS!!  Besides the awesome view, our service was wonderful, and the food....oh the food... it was DELICIOUS!!  We're still talking about the parmesan flan!!  We would love to cleanse our palate with that every day!  At first, we were skeptical, but one taste and we were hooked.

Our server, Todd S., was very friendly and efficient.  He made sure we had everything we needed was able to describe the menu items with great detail - helping us throughout the meal.

We tried the Seafood Salad, Crab and Avacado, Parmesan Chicken, and the soup.  The only minimal complaint was that the lettuce was cut too small.  Otherwise, everyone was happy with their choice.  

Would definitely visit again!  Can't wait to share with more of our guests
