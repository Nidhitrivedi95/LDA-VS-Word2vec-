rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A This is my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas! The service is untouchable, this is truly a dining experience. Whether you are dining here for brunch or dinner, Buchon will not disappoint. The GM Andy goes above and beyond to make you feel special every time you walk through the doors, champagne in hand until your table is ready, wine pairing recommendations, superb menu. Go there!
