kcF-en40P3J9L8nLy5lKqQ Central bistro is a great place. The restaurant itself is open and light with comfortable seating. With glass, brick, wood and marble being the main theme it was relaxed and  inviting. Our waiter was all business and handled our large group with professionalism. I did feel like our drinks took a long time to arrive but after that everything came efficiently. We were there for brunch and ordered the Drunken bread to start and it was fantastic. The bead was perfectly toasted and the cheese was melted and seasoned well. We shared with the table and everyone enjoyed. My fiancé ordered for us the chicken and waffles and the wedge salad. Both were some of the best I'd had in a long time and neither were lacking in presentation or taste. Afterwards they brought some warm chocolate chip cookies with a side of vanilla infused warmed milk and a piece of German chocolate cake which again was shared and enjoyed immensely by all.  I would recommend Central Bistro as a great place for couples, a few friends or large groups.
