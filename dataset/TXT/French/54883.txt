rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A One of the best breakfast places on the strip.  It is a rather formal place so not quite the usual hangover breakfast that people have in vegas.  As a local however I do get the opportunity to have non hungover weekends and so I was able to enjoy the scrumptiousness of their bakery and cooking.  The daily specials are something worth paying attention to as they are made fresh that morning.
