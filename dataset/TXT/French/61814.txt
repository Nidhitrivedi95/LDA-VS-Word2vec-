sphMzEIqY1I2Dzv3zLZY2g I must say this was a real surprise.  Not only was the experience a memorable one for our mid-week anniversary, but it was possibly the best restaurant experience I have had in Charlotte.  We took some special out of town guests downtown a few years ago to a well-recognized old traditional Charlotte restaurant, and spent (with tip) over twice the amount spent tonight per person (without discount) for a nice dinner, wine, dessert, etc. in a dining room that was way too dark to see our entrees.  It was fine, but based on comparisons to other US large city dining experiences we have had, not really that special.  Next time we want to show off Charlotte to our out of town guests, we will definitely come to Bernard.  We had a wonderful appetizer tower with 3 exceptional choices, with our favorite being a tossup between the steak tartare and the spring roll.  We ordered the duck and the beef tenderloin as our entrees, and although the beef was very good, the duck was truly superb.  We shared the nougat dessert and had brandy and coffee to finish out our evening.  I have no criticism to offer, just a hearty recommendation.  I cannot imagine that you would be disappointed.  Bernard lets his food be the star of his show - he does not need anything else to make your evening truly exceptional.
