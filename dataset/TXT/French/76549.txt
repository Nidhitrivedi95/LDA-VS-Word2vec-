Yp9w4nhUowBU_IS_StFXbQ Since we stayed at the tower suite, their breakfast was 
The first morning, we had
-Duck hash and eggs- FIVE STARS! One of the best breakfast(brunch) I had. The duck was tender, pie pastry was perfectly baked, potato was great with duck and sauce was perfect. $29
-Oscar filet Benedict- Four Stars - eggs Benedict with filet and crab. It was very tasty! Filet was cooked perfectly, combination of filet and crab with the eggs and english muffin was interesting but worked well. $27
-Coffee- ok over priced large coffee for $14.
-Orange ginger zest- great fresh squeezed juice. A bit pricy at $10 for a small.

The second morning, we had
-Tableau breakfast- two stars at best - comes with scramble eggs, chicken apple sausages, one potato(delicious but tiny), pastry and coffee. It was kinda disappointing. Nothing special for $23. 
-Peach pancakes- two stars at best - 3 small pancakes with peaches on top. Nothing else and nothing special except the very high price for three pancakes: $17
-Orange ginger zest again $10
We really liked the food there. It's a bit pricy but we are at the Wynn so I guess that's the Wynn price.
