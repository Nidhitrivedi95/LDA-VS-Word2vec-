KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA I lived in this area for many years and had never came in so I finally decided to take my mom for Mother's Day. The entrance is also a wine shop with really good deals on wine from around the world. There is a lot of patio seating which I highly recommend because the view overlooks the lake. 
We had a pre fixe menu for Mother's Day which included a complimentary glass of champagne which was a nice touch! We had the smoked salmon, rib eye medallions, and the creme brûlée with bread pudding. Our orders came out fast and were made to perfection. The rib eye was my favorite and was served on a bed of broccolini and mashed potatoes. Our server was Vincent and he went above and beyond to make sure we had a perfect dinner. He made a great wine suggestion and was friendly and accommodating from beginning to end.
