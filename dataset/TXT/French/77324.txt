YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g I've been a fan of Hubert Keller for many years especially seeing him praised widely on popular television shows like Top Chef.  Went in with high expectations but left with mixed feelings.  Service was outstanding, no problem there.  The food was where the disappointment lay.  The grilled octopus was highly recommended so I ordered it and it was served warm, barely.  Scallop dish was on the saltier side.  Sirloin was tough and chewy and had a bit of gaminess.  The roasted chicken was good and the best dish of the evening was the onion soup veloute.  With thousands of restaurants in Vegas, this is one my family and I may not return to which is sad since we are long time patrons of MB and Delano. :(
