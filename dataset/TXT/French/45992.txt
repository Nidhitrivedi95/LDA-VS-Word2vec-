mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q L'Atelier is one of my favorite restaurants of all time. My boyfriend and I go here almost every time we are in Vegas which is about 5 times a year and we have also been to the same L'Atelier in Paris as well. Every time we come here it feels like a new experience. The ambiance is great but not overly formal, and of course the food is always exceptional. We usually go a la cart but sometimes we do the prix fix menu. The mashed potatoes are LIFE CHANGING and the bread basket is also great. It is completely worth the money and experience, and is money better spent than seeing a Vegas show. Realistically only please go if you are willing to spend the money and love french food and dining experiences.
