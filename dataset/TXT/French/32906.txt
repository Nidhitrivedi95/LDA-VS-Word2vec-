H464UiJ5c7q5dAJ14h731A A nice little neighborhood restaurant that serves some interesting (generally Tex-Mex) twists on classic steak/seafood dishes in a cozy, relaxed atmosphere. If you can grab some seats at the bar, it's probably one of the best places in the city to watch a Habs game, as the food is miles better than all the other restaurants/bars I've been to that have a TV.
