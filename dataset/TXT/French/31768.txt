 We visited it this past weekend, after finding it through Yelp, and ended up eating there every morning for the length of our stay. 
 They serve delicious crepes; I recommend getting the "starter" ( eggs, ham, and cheese) along with the jam crepes. 
 My travel companions enjoyed the strawberry, banana, and Nutella combination, but they are two sweet for me.

 To sum it up; excellent food, fresh, and an off the beaten path feel.
