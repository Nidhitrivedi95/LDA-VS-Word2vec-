JVCLKrdBu9AG5ituSTa-4Q And another nice spot in Verdun! Some would say "but another coffee shop in Verdun, there's too much of it already!" Ah-ah-ah! But no, this one is completely different from the other coffee shops on the Wellington. And let me tell you why!

It's a mix between a coffee shop, where you can stop a bit, take a nice latte and grab an amazing piece of cake (the owner does a lot of the desserts she sells, and she's amazing!! Otherwise, she'll have a nice selection of tasty desserts); and a grocery, where there's an impressive selection of imported goods: chocolate, teas, spices, etc. I really love this little boutique, the owner is a gem to talk to: very polite, always some tips or story to tell you, she's just very cool!

It's also a spot where I go pick up my Fermes Lufa boxes every week, so I need to spend some money as I grab my boxes :D I simply love Café La Tazza, a very nice spot that was needed in Verdun!
