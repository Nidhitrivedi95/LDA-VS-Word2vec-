xBxDMEkFK5GBhiy-8gGE9w Wow. Service has NEVER been so atrocious... As someone who works in the industry, I can't believe there is so little quality control over the staff this place hires. No smiles, no warm welcomes, no thank yous... Just everything delivered with attitude or indifference. Our server must have forgotten that paying customers are not there to service the staff & that it's actually the other way around. She had the audacity to stop me on the way back from the bathroom to say, "thank you for your generosity" in response to the tip we left. Sure, the tip was low but we thought it reflected the kind of service we experienced (or lack thereof). We racked up a $160+ bill midday so the fact that we were treated like a nuisance was unbelievable. As I began to explain our reason for the tip, she rudely snipped, "ok, bye." I'm sorry, chef, that she is representing your food & restaurant...we returned to Brasserie T because we enjoyed it immensely the first time. We certainly won't be back.
