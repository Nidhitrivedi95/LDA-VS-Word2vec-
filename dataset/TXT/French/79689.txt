zqNgwQjj0_XAll-neGikIw We stopped in for lunch one day and had a pretty good experience minus the slow service.   The atmosphere is nice and I love that the patio is dog friendly.  We enjoyed the italian open faced sandwich with prosciutto, mozzarella, bacon and pesto with a side of fries - super tasty and it completely hit the spot for lunch!
