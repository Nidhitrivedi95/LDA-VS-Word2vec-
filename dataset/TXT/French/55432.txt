rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I would give this restaurant a 3.5 but i'll round up.   I ordered the onion soup, poulet roti (chicken) and then we had this chocolate/ice cream dessert.   The friends I went with ordered a range of other entrees which I sampled so here's my eval:

onion soup:   very fresh/hot and a nice presentation however I usually like my onion soup broth a bit saltier.. this one came out kind of bland

poulet roti:   the cabbage and mushrooms that came with the chicken were excellent.  I love mushrooms and these ones were super flavorful and it was a nice balance with the cabbage.  Chicken was okay.. not the best chicken i've had but it was tender and cooked well.   I personally think the chicken at costco is good so maybe I wouldn't be the best critic of chicken entrees ;)

homemade ice cream atop brownies:  mmm mmm good.   Although the brownies tasted like the packaged brownies that I can make at home.  The ice cream was very rich and delicious.  nice presentation.

foie gras:  i didn't order this but friends did and they seemed to enjoy it.  be forewarned though that it is a huge portion - 5 oz!  the salmon appetizer is similar.   Both tasted pretty good and came with toasted bread that was fresh.

There were a few special entrees.. one was steak and it was very tender and tasty.   there was another one that was veal cheeks - yes that is right veal cheeks - apparently that one was also delicious according to my friend.

Our waiter was very attentive and the service was good.   I think overall it was a strong meal, I just wasn't wowed with my chicken or onion soup.
