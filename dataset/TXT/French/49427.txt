or4UVDjXEEjze3wNPjoAZA Still great space.  Our waiter needed to have either brushed his teeth or chewed tic tacs. . My wife's salmon was a salt mine.  My spinach frisée salad had no dressing, no lardons, no frisée.  This used to be excellent at 
$9 and is terrible ar$12.  
The table next to us sent their entrees back as inedible. This chef has lost his way.  Living on laurels and over charging for less than average food.
Also, I do not know why this is considered  a French Restaurant as there
are no French staples except for the fries.
