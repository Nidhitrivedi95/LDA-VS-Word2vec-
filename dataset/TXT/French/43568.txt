m4PW-GMc8JOU5nmMYncu-Q A great artisinal cocktail bar in Montreal.  

The space looks a bit like a speakeasy and has wine barrel covers and casual seating for lounging and drinking.  The stars though are the friendly servers and the great drinks.  

I love great cocktails and the ones at Le Lab were creative, delicious and strong.  

Our waitress was friendly and knowledgeable and although English wasn't her super strong suit, she was personable and recommended the right drinks galore.  Favorites of the night were the Nirvana and the Jerky Lab Jerk.  

It's a popular spot and really started our night off.  We learned a few French phrases, got a list of spots to hit for both food and merriment and continued our fun at the faraway Joe Beef.  

Le Lab accepts credit cards.
