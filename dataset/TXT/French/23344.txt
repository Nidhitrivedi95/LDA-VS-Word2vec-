C6hljmEZYZw4pA0OJaFOjQ I came here for the first time on a Sunday evening for a spot of dinner. I loved the atmosphere, dim lights, paintings on the wall, slow jazz playing and lots of comfy seating. There were two menus available, all day snacks and a la carte. I decided to go for the steak with garlic butter, fries and roasted tomatoes. It was really delicious! And at £14.20 it was a bargain and also the most expensive thing on the menu. This place is ideal if you want an inexpensive but good meal. The desserts are all £2.95 and I had the Key Lime Pie, a creamy cheesecake with a citrus tang topped with white chocolate buttons. Next time I'm in Edinburgh Cafe Marlayne will be high on my list of places to visit.
