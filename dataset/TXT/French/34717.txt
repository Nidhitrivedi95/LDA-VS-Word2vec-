HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw We were staying at the Cosmo and wanted to eat quick and get to our show. This was the only place with no wait that had a TV to watch the NBA Playoffs. The one TV was tiny but worked. We sat in the bar area and ordered  our entrees. Most of us had the burger which was the best part and was very filling. They give you way too many fries so maybe split them with someone?? This is where it went downhill and lost a couple stars. Our waitress who was too busy talking to her coworkers became non-existent. A few of us needed to change real quick so after about 10 minutes waiting for our bills we had to leave our credit cards with others at the table to pay them for us. We got upstairs, changed, went back downstairs and they still weren't done. It took a total of 30 minutes from when we asked for the bill to when they finally brought them. If you want a quick dinner don't go here. It's a french restaurant so the menu doesn't have too many appealing options.
