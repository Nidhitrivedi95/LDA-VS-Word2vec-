PUWPFKvwLNwPmJOgJkDUMQ A lovely experience! I found the place out of luck and thanks to Opentable and it felt like discovering a little secret. What a gem! We had a table on the cute terrace, but inside the place is so adorable I almost regretted stayed outside. Service was perfect, kind, extremely attentive and knowledgeable. Gave us great tips about the menu. Finally, food was delicious! Fresh, creative, very tasty. I will definitely come back soon!
