_T7f2wUgNlJqxsR-cR89SQ Everything was prepared perfectly.

Everything was delicious.

Service was flawless.

A rare 10/10 at the high end.

Only problem *could* be that they don't change the fundamentals of their menu often enough.

If they changed their menu more often I'd go there more. Or if they made it clearer what the specials would be.  Everything is great, but I'd love to see more variety.
