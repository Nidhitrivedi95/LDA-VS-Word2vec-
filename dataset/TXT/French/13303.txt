4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Everyone from the hostess to the waiter were very friendly and chatty.  I had the Smoked Salmon Eggs Benedict.  The eggs were runny and the salmon was salty (just the way I like it).  

I did not love the coffee though, but perhaps I am a pickier coffee drinker than others.

Nothing special, but a good place to have brunch on the strip.
