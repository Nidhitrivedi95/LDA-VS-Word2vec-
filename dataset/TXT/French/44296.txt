ME6D5nLlfG0xZCtICOYDuw I consider a 5 star review a place that I will take visitors when the come to Charlotte. Well, we have taken many visitors to Georges and they still talk about their experience to this day. I say that warrants an upgrade to 5 star!

We have been to Georges many times since the discovery from my initial review. Bottomless mussels on Tuesday for $15, check. Steak dinner out, check. We have not made it to the brunch and that is super sad and needs to be added to our bucket list. 

The firery mussels deserve a paragraph on their own. We came to Georges last night for a mid-week date and literally just got the fiery mussels. It was enough for two. I am not sure if I am embarrassed or proud to say we also killed 3 baskets of bread with the mussels....I mean that sauce is so amazing that is HAS to be soaked up with something. If you go to Georges and do not order the Fiery Mussels, you are doing it wrong. 

I also enjoy the oysters here. Also so fresh with a nice presentation. They are $1 on Fridays! Last night I had one east coast and one west coast. Both absolutely fantastic. In a previous visit, I tried the steak, which was excellently cooked. 

Wine selection is excellent! Service has always been spot on for us as well!
