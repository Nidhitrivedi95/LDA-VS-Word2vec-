zw4Legbcu018p5WcZ74iWA We happened upon Patati Patata quite by accident.  After climbing Mont-Royal, my friend and I were meandering our way down to the vintage shops and cafés of the Plateau, and Patati Patata happened to be on the street our meanderings took us down.

Its reputation had preceded it, as any discussion of the best poutine in Montréal usually (though not always) ends up between Patati Patata and La Banquise.  Anyone who had read my reviews on Yelp knows of my weakness for this heart-attack-on-a-plate.  I had to investigate.

I ordered the Patatine, which is poutine with veggies, the house specialty.  It took a little while to order, mostly because the place was PACKED.  Patati Patata is a hole in the wall to begin with, but usually when a restaurant is packed at odd hours (it was about 3pm), it's for a good reason.  Turns out this is accurate.

The poutine was delicious.  The veggies were a great idea; onions, peppers, and olives added a little something extra.  The gravy was not what I expected, a little sweeter than its Ontario counterpart, but, this being Québec, I'd imagine this is how poutine gravy is supposed to taste.  They did invent the dish (read: delicious mess) after all.

I can see why les Québecoises swear by this place: it's cheap, tasty as all hell, and oozes local flavor. If this friterie somehow magically was transported to Capitol Hill, I'd be there all the time.
