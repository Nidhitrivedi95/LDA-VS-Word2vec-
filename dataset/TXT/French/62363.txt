SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ We hadn't been to House of Tricks in years, so decided to bring our pooch for lunch last Saturday.  The bar area of the patio is the only pet friendly section, but it worked out perfect for us.  The have a beautiful patio that welcomes you to enjoy a lovely lunch or dinner.  I enjoyed a glass of Albarino that was on special for $6 - delicious!  For my lunch I enjoyed the frittata of the day with turkey, bacon, cheese, tomatoes and peppers with a cup of pozole and a side of fruit - a huge portion that was so fresh and flavorful.  House of Tricks will definitely be added to the regular rotation when we are looking for a quality lunch in Tempe.
