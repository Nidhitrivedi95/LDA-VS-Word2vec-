rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w First - the food is wonderful.  BUT I had a terrible experience at the restaurant that is unforgiveable.  I was with my mother (86) my aunt (79) and 2 additional friends. I booked our reservation weeks in advance and informed them that we would be attending Cirque de Soleil in the same hotel.   We were seated at 8:20 for our 8pm reservation and then ordered after 8:30.  I informed all the staff (so many come to the table) that we needed to leave by 9:45pm.  They couldn't have cared less!  it isn't my job to know how slow their service is!  I thought that excellent service was one of the benefits of an expensive restaurant. I guess not.   At 9:40, the waiter suggested we order souffle for dessert because it only takes 15 minutes to make it and we would have plenty of time.  What an ASS. By the time we got out of there, we barely made the show and were seated at the very last possible moment.  Le Cirque ruined my dinner and almost my entire evening.  Unless they apologize to me, I would never ever go back.
