QeEQXdto_4wFRaNKyIygRA Salads are good, but this place's secret is their Thursday special, Baked Chicken.  French Quarter is busy for lunch every day.  Indoor seating is limited, but creates good atmosphere for this place.  They are usually open before Panther games. 

Tip:
To avoid the weekday lunch rush, I recommend arriving no later than 11:30 a.m., or you'll stand in line to get in.  They offer outside seating when the weather is nice.
