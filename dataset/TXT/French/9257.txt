4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw If you love people watching and breakfast this is a decent spot. I'm deducting one star due to our very nice but not very good server. Questions like "would you like your bacon inside your omelette". I know I'm not in New York anymore but isn't that the definition of an omelette. 

Other observations

My wife order an espresso, server brings out  a cappuccino. My wife likes both so we let it go.

Wife order egg white omelette, plate comes out with regular eggs, sent back.

Wife orders milk, comes out in a small cup that I'm pretty sure was threw up on by a child. Or somebody thought we needed grits for our espresso or cappuccino or whatever was on table.

So, finally, foods all in place, omelettes, hot beverages, orange juice, croissants, banana muffins. Everything delicious, food was so good that I wanted to order additional muffins and whatever hot beverage my server selected for me.

Here she comes walking to the table, what is that odd shaped book in her hand, can't be the check, she never asked if there is anything else we would need.

Yup, check. (Face palm)

To wrap it up. Food good, waitress bad, people watching good, tipped her well anyway cause everybody's gotta eat.
