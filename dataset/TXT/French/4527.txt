2gUbgbdJ7IFSbicBXlSchw Honestly I had quite high expectations for L'express because I heard great things about this place. I came for lunch with family and we were a group of eight. I must say the ambiance and the service was 10/10. No complaints on that. They did forget one of our appetizers but that's okay and they got it out asap.

As for the food I must say it was nothing extraordinary and I didn't feel it was worth the price tag. I posted photos of all the dishes we bought and out of them the ones we thought were on the better side were: shrimp risotto, hangar steak, quail and the fish soup. 

The escargot and the os de moelle honestly were the most disappointing. Escargot was nothing special and the bone marrow was drenched in grease. If that's how it was supposed to be then I don't know why anyone would order it. The ravioli also had too much sauce, and the chicken breast was dry (as expected). The grilled salmon was also very disappointing. I guess if I would choose one dish to recommend it would be the shrimp risotto.
