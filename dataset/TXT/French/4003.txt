2B46bRpDh49eDyjXGhL_ZQ I decided to go out for breakfast after the gym and had this place bookmarked for some time.  I sat at the counter after reading the galettes and crêpes descriptions on the large menu boards.

I ordered the galette of the month and a black coffee.  The coffee was brought quickly in a glass that kept the coffee very hot for a long time.  I watched as the young woman made some crêpes that were being taken out and two galettes for other customers eating in house.  And, I had the fun of watching her make my galette.

The galette, made with buckwheat batter, was quite good.  The cheese and tomatoes had a lot of flavor but the honey was very light in adding anything to the dish.

While waiting, I chatted with Madame Maggie and I looked at her homemade jams for sale on the counter.

I need to go back and try a sweet crêpe.  The Nutella seems to be calling me.  It's good to have a crêperie like this not too far from home.
