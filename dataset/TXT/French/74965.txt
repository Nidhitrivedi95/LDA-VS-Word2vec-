XZ7eQLjyGXf6y69UT4SGhg My husband and I just enjoyed a savory and sweet crepe. Both were awesome! We are slowly eating our way through their menu. We were even offered to try a treat that will be offered in September. I do not want to give away the surprise, however I will say it is like heaven on earth.  This place has me screaming praises for the meals and pastries all the way home. I am already  looking forward to my next visit.
