2gUbgbdJ7IFSbicBXlSchw We came here based on the great yelp reviews. It was a bit disappointing since we were expecting much better based on all the positive reviews. We ordered a mushroom tart, steak/fries, and ravioli. Everything was cooked properly, but the taste was just average. The only thing I would recommend is steak, and fries.
