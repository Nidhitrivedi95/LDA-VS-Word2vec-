ohMpNug5zWNxOlL6ShG7Ig Made a return visit one year later.  I had a fish from NW USA called sand dab - new one to me, but very well prepared.  Small filets (size of your hand) somewhat similar to east coast spots I suppose.  Served on a wild rice dish.  My wife had the North Carolina pit BBQ pulled pork platter (served with tomato based rather than vinegar based sauce).  We spend a lot of time in North Carolina, and are spoiled with the original, so hard to make an evaluation.  All in all, once again, a great experience for the price and the setting, and recommend highly.
