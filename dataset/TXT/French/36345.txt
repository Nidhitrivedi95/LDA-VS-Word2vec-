I2LcbNXGsMb6zxh4-gmVHw I was so excited to try our this new addition to downtown and especially when I heard it was the same owners as Rice Paper!  This place just fell short for me...the atmosphere was nice, the service was good, but the food was really not that good.  We tried the sizzling salmon (dry), the cornish hen (dry and tough) and the beef in red wine (the best of the three).  The appetizers were probably the best part about the meal - edamame (messy) and the tuna spring rolls.

I am hoping the quality of the food gets better because I would really like to see this place succeed!
