S5gtq6g6dIfyaFvyPYyzkg The Dome comes into its own at Christmas when it is like a winter wonderland. Every architectural feature on its facade is decked in decorations. Nowhere else in Edinburgh can you dine around such a stunning tree. It really does get you in the mood for Christmas and is great place to have lunch on a Christmas shopping expedition, away from the throngs of crowds on Princes Street.


 The downside of this is that whilst there are, bizarrely, some locals who are not aware of what they are missing on their doorstep and how spectacular the Dome look inside, the rest of Edinburgh does! There are no reservations, so expect to queue at lunchtimes in particular!


 For the rest of the year, the Dome has the perfect ambiance for a chilled out Sunday afternoon, or an evening after work. The cream teas are great, as are the platters and club sandwiches.


 One of Edinburgh's most decadent bar/café/restaurant experiences, amidst its stunning Art Deco features which start with the fantastic swing door!
