lNB-yJoVi-sk6X0uoWOh-g After hitting the Mile End for a brunch date with the girlfriends, we realized our usual spot had a crazy line up. We decided to walk around and find something with less of a line up. We've accidentally stumbled upon Sel Gras on Saint Laurent, and it's been my favorite brunch place ever since. 

Good : Cozy and trendy atmosphere, not too crowded on weekends, and the best salmon gravlax ever. The dishes are well presented and a good portion size. It's not your typical eggs and bacon kinda brunch, Sel Gras really steps up the brunch menu! We had really good service & food arrived pretty quick. I am not really a brunch person (overpriced eggs and greasy heart attack inducing bacon? No, thanks.), but this place has definitely changed my mind with their impressive menu.

Bad : Water didn't come as frequently, but that's okay because I am always prepare and I smuggle my own water bottle at restaurants. 

Bottom Lines : I adore this little restaurant in the Mile End, I've definitely returned a few more times to try their different plates, but the salmon gravlax still has a special place in my heart. Oh, and it also helps that their waiters are ridiculously handsome tattooed hipster men.
