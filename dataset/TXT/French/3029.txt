1aj4TG0eFq6NaPBKk6bK7Q Ordered pastrami sandwich.  Questioned if it was pastrami when it was served (certainly didn't look like it).  Answer yes, it is shredded salami.  That's not mentioned on menu.  As others have said, 'where is the beef', in this case pastrami.  Two 2 inch squares about a quarter inch thick on a 5 inch bun.  Sweet potato fries were just okay.
