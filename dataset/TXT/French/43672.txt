m4PW-GMc8JOU5nmMYncu-Q LOVE this bar. It is so much more than a bar. It's a experience. If you appreciate the art of a cocktail and want to admire it without feeling like you're surrounded by hipsters or people that are trying way too hard, go to Le Lab. It was like walking into a time machine as soon as I stepped across the threshold. I got to see the bartender spitfire and it was awesome. If and when I return to Montreal, this will definitely be a place I go back to.
