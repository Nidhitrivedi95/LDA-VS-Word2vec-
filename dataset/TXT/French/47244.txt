O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q This place was great. We had a reservation for Saturday night at 8pm, but it was not needed as there were plenty of empty tables. The restaurant decor was beautiful and upscale. The surrounding art was erotic and interesting. 

The food was absolutely delicious. We started out with the tuna tartar, which was fresh and very tasty. The onion soup was just ok. It had a little sour taste to it which is something that I am not used to, but that is just a personal preference. I had the 18 hour braised ribs, my husband had the 28 day filet mignon medium well, and a friend had the sea bass. All was very very good. The steak was one of the best I have ever tried. The ribs were delicate and simply melted in my mouth. The sea bass was also very delicate and cooked just right. The drinks were delicious and they did not skimp on the alcohol. 

Overall, expect to pay a lot for dinner. We paid $300 without tip for a three coarse meal for 4 people. The steaks does not come with a side so you will have to order one if you want more than meat. My ribs however, did come with a side of purée potatoes. If you are into great tasting meat and have some money to spend, then give this place a try.
