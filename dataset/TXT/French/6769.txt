4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw My boyfriend and I ate here one evening for dinner while on our vacation and it was excellent!

It seemed to be very busy, but we were able to be seated immediately without a reservation. Plus, the service was tip top. Being inside the Paris casino, it is of course French themed, but is not overly hokey. The atmosphere feels very intimate and romantic.

The food didn't blow us away or anything, but was very good. I had the daily special which was a fish and my boyfriend had a steak. My fish was delish! Both of us finished our meals.

Prices are reasonable for the food and experience.
