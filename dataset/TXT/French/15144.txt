63qPRnFAjxtchnSTWBxwbw Surprised at the reviews. Got the burger as per the waiters suggestion-dry terrible beef and tasteless fries. My friends got the poutine...over all "meh". Its one of those meals you don't finish unless you're starved because it's just not worth it's weight in calories. Will not be going back.
