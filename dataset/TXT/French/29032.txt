EPb3FWs3mxQLUjGeMNP0SQ Pretty nice place plus after 1 you can get an open bar for 2 hours for $25 with a purchase of an entree.  For 2 hours you can get an unlimited amount of any basic mixed drinks (Jameson & coke, cranberry vodka, etc.), house wines, beers on tap, and mimosas.  The service is kind of slow but besides the drinks the food is very good too!
