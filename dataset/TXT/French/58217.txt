rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Just as good as Thomas Keller's west coast venues.  Great intimate French bistro setting with informed servers, quick service, and food that is to die for. Loved the chicken and quince and let me tell you, the desserts are the best part of the evening. I tried both the plum tarte and the chocolate trio of brownies... Absolutely incredible. This was my favorite meal of my most recent Vegas trip. Will definitely be back on my next trip!
