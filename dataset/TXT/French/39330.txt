You have to try the quiche at least once when you are here. The candied pecans are an unexpected surprise with the swiss cheese and bacon mixed inside the quiche.
They are also known for their burgers, so I tried the Cabernet burger, which was absolutely delicious! It's very filling at 1/2 lbs of burgerness! 
I also tried the pate for the first time ever. It was served with toasted bread. I'm not the biggest fan of pate after finally trying it, but my husband loved the creamy texture and pungent flavor of the pate and now compares other pates to this one. 
There are several different kind of paninis available too. If you come with a friend, the paninis seem big enough to split. The lamb panini that I tried had a more gamey taste to it. Fortunately, there was cheese and other toppings that helped balance that strong flavor out. I might just settle for a pork panini next time  for a milder flavor. 
The restaurant itself is not very big. I came here once during the week with coworkers and the six of us sat outside on the patio. The restaurant can get really packed, so it's good that there is patio seating for more options, because it's less crowded on the patio versus indoors. If you're in the mood for a French bistro restaurant, definitely don't hesitate to come try here. It's worth the drive!
