SJo_IjvzdRtCvZVN0cbrRQ When I came across all of the positive reviews about Blue Cafe's delicious pastry I couldn't wait to sink my teeth into one of their famous lemon squares or fresh baked bread, or so I thought. Yet again, I found myself wishing that instead of sitting at their bar eating bland pastry & drinking over priced & disgusting hot chocolate that I was at an actual bar instead. 

Their menu, not for the picky eater! My fiance, however, did love their prince's snack and we both enjoyed a loaf of bread at home later. Can't say I was happy about the butter/oil... whatever it was that left puddles of greasy smears all over my table top. But it pairs great with blueberry/vanilla goat cheese! 

The atmosphere itself was adorable & would make an awesome house, but it was pricey... again, $5.00 for a really awful hot chocolate! I got some type of wild berry pinwheel puff pastry, definitely not enough  filling & too much butter/grease... all around little to no flavor. But I will say this, they are the first eatery I've visited where they used cardboard doggie bags and I must give them a hats off to being eco- friendly!!!
