EEIz44ewHhOKmfTloAK13g It's not an expensive restaurant, it's a cheap plane ticket.  You're whisked away to the land of stars and sophistication.   Just awesome.

Sure, I'd heard the hype around this restaurant.    About the world-class preparations, beautiful decor and warm attentive service.    About how it takes months to get a reservation. 

But to be honest, the hype actually wasn't enough.    Toronto has never had a restaurant of this style and sophistication.   Not even close.  It's very much the kind of thing that you experience at higher end restaurants in Paris, Chicago or New York. 

A completely flawless, almost effortless experience.  Perfect in every way.   

The devil is in the details.   From the matching brown shoes on all the serving staff, to the way that the staff walk you to the hidden washrooms instead of merely pointing the way.     At first I thought that having your choice in napkin style was just to mask some detriment or oversight, but I ended up being wrong.   It was just a part of the fantastic culinary theatrics.

Every single movement appears to be choreographed to precision.     But not in a stuffy or silly way.    It's comfortable.   It's classy.   It's human.   

How do they keep this up?  No pressure, right?     

It takes a phenomenal amount of work on many levels to get all of this so right.   Much respect has to go to the front-of-house, who exist really on the same level as the superb kitchen.

Perhaps the best part of our evening circled around our repeated conversations with the sommelier, Christopher.  It truly wowed me how he was able to provide outstanding guidance that led us in some truly interesting directions without making us feel stupid or out-of-place whatsoever.     Wines were expertly paired and eloquently explained. 

It's probably a good thing that it's so difficult to book a table.    Otherwise I'd have no reservations wanting to go here for every night out.   

Spectacular.
