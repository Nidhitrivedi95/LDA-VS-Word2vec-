4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw On my last business trip to Vegas, I knew I had to try to stop here for dinner. Made a reservation for 7:30 pm and there was a line for those with reservations! Crazy! Luckily, they had space by the bar so after waiting in line for my turn, I was seated and went straight to ordering.

Complimentary baguette (yum!) with butter to snack on before your meal comes.

French onion soup $10 - come pipping hot and very filling. Thick cheese with generous portions of onions. This is enough to be a meal by itself. 

Hangar steak $20 - steak on the lower end of the price spectrum. Great sauce, pretty salty (I'm sure finishing the french onion soup beforehand added to the salty taste), and pretty fatty. I had difficulty cutting into it. Would not recommend this cut of meat. 

This place has wonderful atmosphere and I'm sure it's even better on the outdoor patio, for another day when it's easier to grab a spot without a long wait. The french onion soup should not be missed, while the hangar steak definitely should not be revisited.
