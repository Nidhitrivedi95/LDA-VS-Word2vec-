j0baDQfMAGDm_QGdFMmb-Q Little Paris in Arizona! I was on my way to a breakfast place initially, but ended up in this modern and well embellished French bistro. Lunch menu is amazing, partially written in the native language. The service is great. I even dusted my French with (I suppose) the owner who's originally from France. One of the very few places that has Croque Madame! 
C'est magnifique madame merci beaucoup et à bientôt!
