4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Unfortunately, even during the week, this restaurant was always too packed to just walk-in. The wait time for "Lonely Party of One" was just too long so I went elsewhere. 

Judging by the ambience, massive amounts of people always there, massive amounts of people waiting to be seated, looking with no shame at plates coming out to diners, fabulous outdoor seating and location, I'm going to go ahead and give them five stars. It was one of the most popular restaurants that I saw on The Strip. Beautiful place to dine at with spectacular food presentation and views. 

Before leaving Vegas I did end-up asking, they do take reservations and you are highly encouraged to make one. Now I know, next time I will be dining here.
