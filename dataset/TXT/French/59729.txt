For an aperitif, I ordered a drink called the Pamplemoose, which was made with Edinburgh Gin, Elderflower Liqueur, and Grapefruit. It was delicious. 

For dinner, I had Sea Bass Filets, which was super fresh and perfectly cooked. It was only lightly seasoned, which allowed the flavors of the fish to be the focus of the dish. My husband had the Mussels with a side of Frites which he thoroughly enjoyed. 

Definitely, a must stop when in Edinburgh.
