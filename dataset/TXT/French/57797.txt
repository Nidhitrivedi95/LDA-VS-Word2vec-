rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Heard a lot of this place in Vegas and that is was a must for breakfast/brunch. We started with mimosas the original and I had the hibiscus mimosa a must if you want something different for the original. Ask your server as they have other flavored as well. For breakfast my honey had the eggs Benedict and I had the croquette Madame delicious. For desert !! Yes for breakfast make sure you get a coffee with pastries super good. All this probably be a $100 for breakfast but you will not mind as the food is excellent.
