cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg Warning... don't come near this place if you're on a diet or if you don't like very rich dishes. Definitely don't step foot in this place unless you LOVE foie gras. And make sure to make reservations in advance... I made reservations three weeks before my trip to Montreal and had to settle for a later seating because this place is just that popular. 

I love that it's not pretentious and quite casual. The food gosh I don't know where to start... the only description for it is it's like having an orgasm in your mouth. The foie gras poutine, duck in a can and foie gras potato pancake with maple syrup were so unbelievably good that my boyfriend and I practically licked our plates clean. We were stuffed beyond belief but we ordered dessert anyways and lets just say we were speechless. The pot of chocolate was so good we once again wanted to lick the jar clean. 

We tried to make reservations for another night while we were there since the food was so divine... unfortunately they were booked solid for the week.
