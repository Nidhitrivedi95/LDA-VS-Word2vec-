ZrHU8ZzwZQjTRpB1K_8JTQ We've been waiting for 1847 Stamm House to open. Glad to miss the opening kinks being worked out some reviews mentioned. Went last night, and it was fabulous!! The fish fry was a new take on a Wisconsin fav, a whole piece of whitefish with delicious cole slaw and picked sides. All amazing! Can't wait to return to try the rest of the menu. Maybe on a night that's quiet, if there is one. Glad to see the place was hopping!
