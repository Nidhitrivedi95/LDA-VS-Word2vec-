4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Thrilled with this place. For the price/quality/service it merits at least 4 stars. The fifth star is a bonus for their baguettes. They are unreal. Our table devoured 4 of them and we never heard any complaints. I recommend the mussels and then dipping their unreal bread into the garlicky buttery amazingness the mussels are served with. Steak frites was also quite good as well as the fish and chips. Didn't have to wait long to sit outside (great view of the strip) and everyone left completely satisfied. Looking forward to coming here again!
