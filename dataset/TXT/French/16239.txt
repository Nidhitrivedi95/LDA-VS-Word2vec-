7MltaA4C_wYJ72JHCOS4zQ This was easily a top 5 meal I've had in my life. The flavors were intense but paired so well. I would encourage you to try things even if they may have an ingredient you don't like- it will not taste like what you think it tastes.

The cocktails were delicious. The Phoenix is their take on a negroni and it was better than any negroni I've ever had. I had the seafood tartar, the pork belly, and the Seabass with seafood risotto. All spectacular.

Don't balk at the price. This is a restaurant for a date night and it is well worth it. Service and atmosphere were excellent.
