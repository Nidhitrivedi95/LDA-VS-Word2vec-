SpkwuDQChxHlNwfnx7OWUA Hungry naked lady: I'm hungry.
Hot Canadian dude: You're always hungry. What do you want to eat for lunch?
Hungry naked lady: Umm, something Canadian? *pulls up Yelp in Brampton*
Hot Canadian dude: Like?
Hungry naked lady: Hmm, do you eat poutine?
Hot Canadian dude: Yeah. Of course. 
Hungry naked lady: Ok, have you tried this place? *shows him yelp page*
Hot Canadian dude: Nope but it's about 20 minutes away. Do you want something closer?
Hungry naked lady: *insert inappropriate comment about gravy*
Hot Canadian dude: Ok, it's time to feed you.

And feed we did. Clothes. Car. Order. I finally had piping hot poutine with crispy fries, slathered in a sumptuous gravy and perfectly melted cheese curds to quell my hunger. Add extra mayo, and ohhh, it's so heavenly. Breaded dill pickles, fried egg, bacon, onion rings -- you cannot go wrong here. Next time, a steamie to go with it all.

Apparently from my experience in the States with poutine, I've never had it so good. It doesn't seem to be that difficult to make fries with gravy and cheese curds. But after countless times of eating what seemed like mozzarella cheese and powdered gravy mix on top of soggy fries, I pretty much have given up on crappy US poutine. Thankfully now I know where to go, albeit, I'm nine hours and several thousand miles (or rather kilometers) away. Still, I'm so delighted that even my experienced poutine connoisseur agreed that this place was absolutely delicious.

So there you go. Hot Canadian dude approved.

If you're in the area and looking for poutine, this poutinerie does it right. Condiment bar included. Don't be surprised though when you have a food baby at the end of your meal. Yep, be prepared to be rolled out the door (and hopefully across the street to the ice cream/gelato shop.) 

Happy eating!
