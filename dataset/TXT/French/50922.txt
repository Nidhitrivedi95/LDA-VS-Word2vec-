We had everything from Lobster, foie gras, caviar, smoked salmon and it ended with the craziest cotton candy tree. It took us about 3.5 hours to finish 12 courses so plan accordingly. The hosts, waiters, and cheese specialist (yes, they have one) were all ridiculously professional and made this place one of the highlights in our Montreal trip.
