K64Uw3a2Enh2MznpwRHWKQ Razz has been around in the Valley since before I was born, but it was one of those places that I never had gotten around to trying until recently. I can see why he's been a mainstay of the city's dining scene for so long - his food is terrific, the atmosphere is pleasantly casual, the service is good (although not as "refined" as you might expect for that price point), and the prices are fair...not to mention that he's a great people person, working from his open kitchen, chatting with diners, and going around to greet his customers at their tables. Menu items change periodically, but the duck cake appetizer is a mainstay, and for good reason - it's a dish he's been making his whole career, and it's delicious! Is Razz's the standout it was before the likes of Binkley's and Noca opened? It's not, but his fans like it that way, as do the critics of the Republic, apparently, who named it the "Best Kept Secret."
