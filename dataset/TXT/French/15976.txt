I went there for Sunday brunch with my wife. We were quickly seated in nice comfy chairs by the window.  The decor was nice and just the sort of "country cafe" we were looking for.  I thought the menu was well put together and had a few standout items (like duck bacon anyone?) We were left with our menus for quite a long time and another couple who came in after us were already being taken care of.  Eventually orders were in--Charlotte (eggs benedict w/ smoked salmon) and a Classic breakfast w/poached eggs.  The waitress came a few minutes later with our drinks and couldn't remember between the two of us who ordered the coffee.  Coffee was mediocre.  From ordering, it took about 30 minutes for our food to arrive and while we waited we were seen to by two different waitresses who kept asking us the same questions.  It doesn't seem like teamwork or communication are high priorities in the hiring process.

The food was well presented and I was looking forward to my eggs.  They served their eggs benedict on a scone, which is a nice variation from the normal English muffin.  The dish would have been better if the scone wasn't served cold.  The eggs were a bit overcooked and the potatoes lacked seasoning.  My wife's eggs were also overcooked.  Her toast was hardly toasted and definitely not buttered.  We eventually had to ask for some butter as no one checked-in until we were nearly done with our meal.

Despite Stouffville's limited selection, I still would not recommend this place.
