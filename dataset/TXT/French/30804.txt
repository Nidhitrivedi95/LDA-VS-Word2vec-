fyJAqmweGm8VXnpU4CWGNw Have only been for groceries and sweets to go. My visits were over two years ago, around the time when they first opened. My gf and I lived in the area then and I have to say that we had a pleasant experience on every occasion. The owners were very helpful with our wine selections and the pate and confit were a treasure.

Haven't been in awhile but will be returning soon. I don't understand the negative reviews as I've not gone for sit down service. As a neighborhood place, I believe guests might be more understanding or helpful if the service isn't quite what they may expect. I mean, how many French groceries are there in YOUR hood?!?!?
