Where we sat... horrible! 

With that being said... We sat next to the kitchen, where the waiters were rushing in and out of there. Every time a waiter would pass by, either my purse would fall to the floor, my jacket would flip over, or my hair would fly all over. It felt like they were running past by us.  Next time, I know where not to sit.
