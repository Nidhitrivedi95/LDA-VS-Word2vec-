2gUbgbdJ7IFSbicBXlSchw We went here as so many people raved about it on yelp! Thought I was the luckiest person to score a table last minute at 5 in the evening. 
The bread was so "average" for a highly rated place! The octopus salad was ok. Quiche was good. Steak frites was average nothing to rave about. And the chicken breast was way over cooked! It was DRY and were it not for the mustard sauce it sat on it was tasteless! 
Seriously save your money and your selves! Go somewhere else! I don't understand what the hype is all about to the point that it's booked every night! People do you not know REAL good food (?) that you actually say this place is great?????!!? So sad, as this was our last night and I really wanted it to be a good meal!
