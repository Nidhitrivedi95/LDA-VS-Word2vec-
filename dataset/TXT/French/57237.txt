rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A A thoroughly memorable dinner in a beautiful and inviting space. I had the Croque Madame and it was amazing. Very fresh with a creamy rich topping. The soft egg on top was perfection as well. 

My dinner companion had the short rib and mashed potatoes and it was also delicious. The portion was huge and beautifully presented.

We were seated immediately and our waiter, James, was knowledgeable and helpful. He didn't seem to mind that I only had a sandwich for dinner and happily substituted a huge fresh salad for the French fries. It made for a perfect compliment to the rich sandwich. perfect vinaigrette dressing.

My only regret is missing the lemon tart. This will be the first thing on my list for a return visit.
