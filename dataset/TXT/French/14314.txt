58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw Perhaps having had a decent amount of breakfasts, I don't understand the hype about this place. It's not terrible, but at best, it's average (slightly better than average on a few items such as their baked beans, salmon cake, and smoked salmon bagel). The eggs were either too dry or extraordinarily soggy (waterlogged), while the toast consistently came out burnt (almost to a crisp - and not only for us, but also for the patrons around us). Our server didn't seem to notice the char that was supposed to be our toast, in fact, besides taking our order, he didn't speak at all. It was the busboy who inquired if things were okay, and offered to ask the kitchen to change the toast (we declined, as we had finished). The smoothie was quite watered down, and not what you'd expect from a 'supposedly' chic place, although the hot chocolate was not too shabby. Overall, a very average dining experience, much like going to a diner where the servers just take your orders and perhaps offer you coffee refills, not much more.
