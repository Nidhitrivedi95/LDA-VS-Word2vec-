T4g4k2OhCTsiqcP-ZXElHQ Jules is and always has been a great place for lunch and even dinner if you are in the area, I have never had a bad meal here. My favorite has always been the tuna steak by far, you just cant beat a properly prepared tuna steak. Last time I had one of their omelettes with brie / asparagus and it was huge and very tasty, but you really need to like brie...lots of it.

The prices are also very reasonable and service is fine for what I would expect. This place is definitely worth a visit and almost anything you get should be good...just dont order a salad please OK?
