jLxeBgWhLRbII2ACkgH1Sg This is an update to my previous post. This place just get better and better. They've made some changes in the menu for much better! The viennoiseries are soooo delicious, croissant, raisin bread, hazelnut bread, brioche, etc. My favorite is the apricot danish. Also, the desserts like key lime with raspberry and meringue, opera, tarte aux fruits. Last but not least, they make delicious macarrons!! Incroyable! This is a little piece of France in Las Vegas at great prices.
