bRmb81XDG3E2SOHARBLTog This is the best restaurant I have been to on Baldwin Street. The food is delicious, very French and really well flavored and sauced.
 Service is a little slow and -1 star. For the cost and the quality of food the service should not be amateur. For example, simply because one of our party had not yet arrived, that is no excuse to leave us unattended for the first 20 minutes without even water.
The food is really good though. The room is lovely, very cozy and homey. i would go back simply to try more of the selection. They had prix fixe for lunch but some of the choices were not available, so we all went with the regular menu. I had the escargot and sweetbread app, and a grilled swordfish entree. Others had french onion soup and loved it, duck and paella entrees. Universal praise for the food. Even the bread they served was excellent. Worth a visit.
