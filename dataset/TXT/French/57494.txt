rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A My last 2 dinners at Bouchon in Vegas did not live up the hype that Thomas Keller joints generate. That being said, it's still good French food that's worth trying once, especially if you're already staying in the Venetian.

The good (from what I remember): French onion soup, mussels, creme brulee, and the complimentary bread. I typically don't butter my bread, but this butter is a must! The french fries that come with half of the entrees taste like less salty McDonalds fries--good or bad thing, you can decide.
