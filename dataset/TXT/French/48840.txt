oJZNHz5UUVUgrZwVBVlpYw I visited Petrossian Bar with five other tea friends in early August 2015. Firstly, it is super simple to find. The sitting area was nice and they were able to keep the 6 of us together. You can hear the noise from the casino but it is not overwhelming. Everything was beautiful, classy, and clean. Our server was on top of everything. We never lacked for hot water, lemon curd, or anything else we asked for. I had the Tung Ting oolong which was very good. My only complaint about the tea is that they leave the leaves loose in the pot so if you are a slow sipper, your last cup is pretty bitter. At our table, we also tried the chamomile, Earl Grey, and Jasmine Pearl. Everyone was happy with the tea. The sandwiches were very good and we each were able to order our own. They provide two scones per person which was more than enough, and they even sent some of us home with boxes that didn't finish. The desserts...oh the desserts. Very good! 

All in all, I was really happy with the experience and my friends enjoyed it as well.
