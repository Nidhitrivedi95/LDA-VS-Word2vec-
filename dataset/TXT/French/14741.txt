5fquJHY2hMX9tPRD5s0t5g Sat at the kitchen bar upstairs, food was fine until my wife pointed out (who's a chef) no one in the kitchen wears gloves. We were OK initially until we saw a guy in the kitchen cleaning flour from the breading station basket in the garbage can by first using a spoon or knife to get flour off then by hitting the basket inside the top of the garbage can and then putting it right back in the flour station right in front of me!!!! Constantly seeing cooks wiping their nose scratching and then going back to making food!!! Will not be back and advise on not going.
