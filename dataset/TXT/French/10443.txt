4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw We had reservations at another French restaurant but switched to here at the last minute. We secured an atrium table that allowed us to see the strip and the fountain show. As far as cuisine, this is a proper French bistro. The   Caeser salad, tartare and pate were on point. Hangar steak and scallops delivered. This is quality dining without all the white glove BS at more expensive places. We will be back
