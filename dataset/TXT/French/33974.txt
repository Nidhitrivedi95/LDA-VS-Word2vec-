hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA Chocolate croissant was fluffy, light, and delicious. I could eat 60 or 70 of those...Coffe was delicious as well.

Very friendly service. Very clean place. A little tough to find, but there's a map in the Yelp photos. 

Directions: Basically, go to where you GPS takes you, but head straight to the back center of the parking lot. When you are by the highway, you are very close...
