vg55SAkrEmuHpWfIMtJjBQ I went to Legume for the first time a few weeks ago. The atmosphere, service, and food were excellent. We made a reservation for a Friday night. The food is very fresh, local, and best of all, delicious. When eating the first bites of my food, I paused to enjoy all of the flavors. 

Also, bring a bottle of your favorite wine.
