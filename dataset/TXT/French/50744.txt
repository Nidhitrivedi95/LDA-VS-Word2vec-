oZHbPhIj01_31jqD053a_Q Easily in my Top Five Restauarnts..a unique, amazing dining experience in the beautiful city of Montreal. I'm pretty sure our 4  course prix fix meal ended up being 10 with all the add-ons, plus the take home cotton candy and madolines in a chinese take out box. I am used to amuse bouches and after dinner treats, but I have never been to a place where I got a got the worlds tastiest 'cheese cigar' served to me in a humidor in between my app and entree. And then some slices of sashimi right after that (can't remember the fish). The food itself was really great..especially the foie...seared and finished with veal ju and a pinch of coffee, it was a really rich dish...very bold for the chef to serve it like that as opposed to the usually way of serving seared foie with some sort of fruit garnish to offset the richness of the foie. The teaser of a lobster "cappucino" with black truffle left me speechless. My entree of veal cheeks was really good, but maybe a tad less exciting than what came before. Then the parade of desserts...all Ii can say is..wow. And the value for all this food is amazing. I can't wait to come back and do the tasting.
