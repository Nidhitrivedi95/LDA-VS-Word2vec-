Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA as i've said before...i'll have a good time if i'm with the right people.   it's been over a year since my first time to the mix lounge, but since i just discovered yelp, i'm just now writing my review!  we came here because we didn't feel like going to a full on club that night.  we were pleasantly surprised!  at first we weren't quite sure about the place, but then we decided to get bottle service and a table on the outside patio.  the weather was nice and the view was even better.  carot top sat in the booth right next to us.  the dude is freakin' huge!  i had no idea.  anyways, there's a small dance floor with decent music, but we had a good time.  the ambiance and table service was nice.  i good place to have some drinks, chill with friends and get a little dancing in.
