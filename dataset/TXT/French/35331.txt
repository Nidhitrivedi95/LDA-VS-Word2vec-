Ht-_i0UAq7YDBaqJwcQMdQ The outside of the restaurant is humble and low profile. Since it was hard to see the inside from the outside, I thought that the restaurant was a small tranquil place. 

Once I entered, I knew that I was wrong. The place was packed with so many people. There was so many things going on. The staff were moving left and right, the customers were smiling, the place was bigger than I expected, and the decor was inviting. Imagine being inside of an inn or a castle during medieval times, that. 

As for the food, my entrée was bison ravioli which was good. The dessert of frozen maple parfait was alright but my main dish of surf 'n' turf was amazing. The meats were perfectly cooked and the seasoning was spot on. Very memorable dish. 

Overall, a good restaurant suggested by many reviewers and I can see why.
