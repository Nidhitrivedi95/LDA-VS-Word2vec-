q0n4I-zqiI47xispOqc1lA Stopped by Cafe Mona with a friend of mine this week and were pleasantly impressed with another new bistro.  The interior is eclectic and kind of reminds you of being on vacation somewhere else.  The outdoor seating in the rear is as pleasant as it gets.  Vibrant and colorful and quite airy.  My friend had the chicken pesto salad which looked incredibly fresh and attractively constructed.  I had the Cheese steak crepe which I wanted to try just out of curiosity.  The flavor was exact but the crepe made the dish a whole new experience.  A good part of the menu is crepes and I wast to try many more.  The staff were friendly, courteous and attentive.  But most of all...they smiled and seemed honestly glad to see you.  Quite friendly and gracious.
