The service was a little spotty at first since we had to wait around for about 5 minutes before anyone came by. I think there was some miscommunication from the host and our server, but after that it was great.

The real reasons to go to this restaurant are the great light/waterfall show outside while you're eating, and of course the fantastic food.

Try to get a seat close to the lagoon outside, that's the place to be.

Started out with the caesar salad that was great. I've never had avocado in that type of caesar but it made it better than usual ones.

We got the 40oz ribeye for two and it's certainly enough for 3 people. This was a beautiful dish. Expertly cooked, seasoned, and sliced. It came with some bone marrow that was great with the steak. If you're a steak lover this is the dish to get. Other tables were impressed with the dish and probably were crying on the inside they didn't get it.

We had a chocolate souffle for dessert, which was great. A better version of the molten chocolate cake you've had at TGI Friday's.

Expect to drop about $100 a person. 

Loved this meal!
