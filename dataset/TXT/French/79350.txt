zIyqiWYKrCvAdGeWXXBxFw Came here for summerlicious, don't think this worth $45 at all. Huge portions but taste was either too blend (onion soup and smoked salmon) or salty (seafood papperdella - the seafood were wayyyyyyyyyy overcooked) I was very disappointed with their molten lava cake as well, there wasnt any chocolate poured out ..it was just like a dry heated brownie. Server was nice and attentive so I gave them an extra star for it.
