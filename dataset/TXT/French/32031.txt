gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA Took group of 15 to dinner on Saturday August 6, 2011. Group of employees and husbands as well as our 4 teenage children. Awesome panoramic view of Vegas. Restaurant staff very professional but welcoming and friendly. NEVER made us feel stupid, which would've been easy since most of group not used to fine formal dining. Explained anything we asked about. Food was best I've ever tasted. Had cheese plate instead of a salad before entree. Loved it! I ordered the duck breast and since I had already had the cheese and much wonderful bread, I got full before I had eaten half. I shared the duck with several friends and all enjoyed it. So tender! We had a table of shared desserts. All were good but the creme brûlée was the BEST EVER!
