This restaurant has the best outdoor patio on the strip!   I truly enjoy dining here because of excellent food,  excellent service,  and the excellent ambiance and feeling I get.   It really does remind me of happy memories from France a few years ago. 

I like this casino a lot,  I've been up to the Eiffel Tower view and I have also dined at Eiffel Tower restaurant above,  but there is just something special about Mon Ami Gabi. I highly recommend coming here for breakfast ...  preferably if you can sit outside on the patio and enjoy the view of the strip, Bellagio Fountains across the way!
