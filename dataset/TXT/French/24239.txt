cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg The hype is real. Amazing experience. 
We ordered the PIED DE COCHON farcie au fois gras. 
The lady recommended to share it with 2 people, so we took an appetizer too. 
woowwo the Comesquis foie gras. CRAZY! You put it in your mouth and it EXPLODED of juiciness. So tasty. I would've have eaten 10 of those, no problem haha
The Pied de Cochon is impressive. Crispsy on the outside, wall of fat and meat/ veggies and stuff inside. Foie gras a bit everywhere and potatoes on the bottom. Sauce matches well with the meal. I'd say the first 10 mins of eating is amazing. Then you feel like dying from heart attack ahha. Really fatty dishes, but if you take a drink it goes well. 
Once in a lifetime experience. 
Definitely coming back for the big head with lobster.
Keep the good job! We like those kind of restaurants in Montreal
