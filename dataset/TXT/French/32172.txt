gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA I cannot believe this unfinished review on one of my favorite restaurants has been sitting there for exactly one year! Since I started the drat, we have been back there an additional 3 times. That says something about how much we enjoy Alize. 

So what makes a restaurant truly memorable? Is it simply saying, "that place was great"? Or is it posting a few pictures on Yelp and giving it 5 stars? Well yes. But for me, I found myself actually missing Alize and their tasting menu, and wanting to go back and experience it all over again. 

After my first visit in 2010, Alize became, and still remains one of my favorite restaurants. It's the first place we thought of when we made plans for a celebration in Vegas. The service is consistently top notch. The view of The Strip is unrivaled. And of course ... the food, absolutely amazing!

We ordered the Summer tasting menu in early September '14. A Fall / Winter tasting menu in January '15 and another tasting menu in May '15. Their consistency was unmatched. Each course came out at near perfect timing. Dirty dishes do not stay on our table long as there seems to be staff members lurking in the darkness, waiting for us to put our utensils down. I won't go over each course individually as their creative menu changes with the season, and could possibly be quite different when you go. But I can state with certainty the plating, the combination of flavors, the view and service makes the entire experience memorable. 

If I had to complain about something (let's face it, there's no 'perfect' place) is a course called Etorki. I recall it to be a dry cheese course that just didn't work well with my palette and the tasting menu. 

Also, unless they did a recent remodel, but the men's restroom looks like it belongs at a truck stop. It's small, dark and dingy with an old paper towel dispenser. It's very unlike the whole Alize experience. But I didn't go there to use the restroom. I return to indulge in the whole incredible dining experience provided by the incredible chef and team at Alize.  

Highly recommended! 

Notes: 

* Top of the Palms. Depending on what time of year you go, reserve a table when the sun sets. The Strip view is incredible as the sky changes color during sunset.
* If you ask nicely for a table facing the Strip during the reservation process, they might accommodate, because they are just awesome! 
* If you're driving to the Palms, remember which garage you parked at. Apparently there are 3 exits and after a few drinks, we forgot where we parked. 
* Weeknights tend to be a bit less crowded
* Excellent place for any type of special occasion.
