U1ZpRirMDXF_4_MCFAcmvg Attention! Attention! Hidden gem in plateau! This place is seriously awesome. I brought my boyfriend here and we both were totally impressed by the food and service. I had a ceviche, and bluefin tuna which was perfectly what I believe was pan seared. SO GOOD. Seafood here is absolutely delicious. My bf had the bisque and scallops, he enjoyed it as well. There was some sauce left over from my bluefin tuna and yep, I pretty much cleaned the plate. I even ate the decorative flower. Mmm...

Anyways, really a good spot to eat French food and seafood. I highly recommend visiting this joint for a romantic evening or even with good friends. Service is attentive and friendly as well. The pricing I also find is fair for the quality of the food. Definitely check it out if you are in plateau area! Oh and it is a BYOW place, so feel free to bring something!
