The food is not pretentious, the portions are generous, and the prices are reasonable. We were very happy. Just keep in mind that Le Lyonnais is not trying to push the boundaries of creativity.

The restaurant itself has very high ceilings and large open spaces. It's not very cozy, but is a nice place for a night out, or for a group.
