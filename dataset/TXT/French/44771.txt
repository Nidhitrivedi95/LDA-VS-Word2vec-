The food is nice- I personally recommend the Thai Red Curry, which was very good. The service is also good, with excellent and attentive staff who are friendly and charming.

At this point, you may be thinking 'but isnt the food and the staff who serve you your food what makes a restaurant great?' - but I can assure you, there are some big problems.

Firstly, The Wild Elephant certainly is a wild one - with eratic opening times which one would assume has no bearing on actual peak times of people wanting to eat in Thai restaurants, its best to ring up and book to make sure you are not dissapointed to find out that the restaurant isnt open when you want it. More so, as our night wound on the feeling that the staff were waiting for us to leave was awkward and unpleasent - but the staff (to thier credit), did remain happy and helpful until we were finished of our own accord. 
Secondly, the interior designer needs to be shot - an update to the 80's decor is desperatly needed! Not a huge thing, but enough to put a downer on the evening on account of being so dull.
Lastly, and this is a big one - the price. The Wild Elephant is expensive, and needlessly so - other restaurants of this standard are charging half the price for the same food.

The over all experience is of good food and friendly staff, but in an atmosphere of being unable to relax, for fear of being thrown out of the 80's with a huge bill.
