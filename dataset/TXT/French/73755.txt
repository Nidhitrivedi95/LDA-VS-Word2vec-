xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g Took my mom here for mother's day this year, around 7:30pm.  We didn't mind not being at a direct window table, so we were seated at a very nice booth that still had an awesome view of the strip and the Bellagio fountains.  Mom had a great Singapore Sling (she hasn't ordered one of these in like 20 years), and  I had some ginger drink that was on their drink list - both tasty.  We just did dinner - she had salmon and I had filet - both were great (the filet was one of the best I had my whole time in Vegas and we ate at a lot of fancy places!).  If you are a dessert person, you really need to order the souffle - omg so tasty!  I had pistachio and mom had chocolate and both were amazing.  A bit pricy overall, but the view is outstanding and the food is terrific.
