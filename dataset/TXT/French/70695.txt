The place is very small. This small restaurant could probably seat up to about 15 people. Like some of the yelpers describe, it's like a prestige subway, the layout, and how you can pick your own toppings and sauces. 

I've always like the salty crepes over the sweet ones so when I came across muncheez, I wanted to give this place a try. I got the mama mia. It was just the right about of saltiness and flavour. I had a late lunch and I can't believe I was able to finish a while waffle by myself! It must have meant it was really good! My tastebuds and stomach told me. 

Service was really good. They even gave us wet naps which I was impressed with! 

I'd come back again for the mama mia!
