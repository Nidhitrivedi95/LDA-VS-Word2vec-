Ht-_i0UAq7YDBaqJwcQMdQ If you are looking for a classic place that basically delivers on food and service, this is it.  While the decor is a bit dated, the food is very good. I was not amazed by anything here, but I appreciated the tasty food and the well-presented plates.

I would choose this for....

* Romantic dinner
* Safe dinner- no surprises here. Pretty straightforward surf n turf, scallops, chocolate, etc.
* old Montreal
* wine list
* old school meal that is not exactly a steakhouse
