rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A This place is so over-rated. I was so disapointed because Thomas Keller is one of my culinary heroes. In any case, it wasn't bad... but with so many choices at simliar prices in the same casino even... I wouldn't recommend a visit. Perhaps, you should try Lutece or Valentino's instead. Both, are must sees.
