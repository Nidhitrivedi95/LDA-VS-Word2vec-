qmh6zxtJ8C8-YiUPv7ySlw For a $58 all inclusive (tax and tip included; excluding beverages) 3-course pre fixe meal, I'd say Daniel Boulud is definitely a solid bet for 15+ girls celebrating a bachelorette weekend in Las Vegas. The service was impeccable throughout the entire meal... up until our server forgot our dessert and had us wait another 15 minutes for it. But really, I can overlook the dessert mishap given the fact that our meal was delicious. And the warm pear clafoutis was definitely worth the wait. 

An overall great dining experience... although I might make a note that while the lakeside show is entertaining (though at times, a bit weird and eerie) -- having it go off every 15-20 minutes can be quite distracting and interruptive.
