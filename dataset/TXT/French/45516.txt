mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q Came here for my 5 year wedding anniversary and it was amazing.  The decor is upscale, yet somehow casual and inviting.  The staff was amazing, not just our waiter but even the head chef (who given the space is like 10 feet from you) and the manager who were just awesome.  Food was spectacular, one of the most correclty prepared pieces of medium rare beef i've been served and although it sounds simple, the mashed potatoes are the mashed potatoes against which all others you ever eat in your life will me measured, and all others will be found lacking.
