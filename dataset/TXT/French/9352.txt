4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw We had a late dinner on the patio and caught the back end of the Kabuki Spectacle across the street at the Bellagio Fountains.  We only waited about 5 minutes to be seated, and it was a beautiful summer night.  The bread in the bag came out hot and crisp. I had the Trout Nicoise and my friend had the Salmon Salad.  They were both delicious, could not have been any better!  Considering the generous portions, these prices were reasonable!
Will definitely recommend and will be back for this great dining experience!
