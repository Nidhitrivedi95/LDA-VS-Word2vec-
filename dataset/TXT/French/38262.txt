JezHN-9KKLTMbojq00VP0g Excellent ambiance. Perfect date spot in Ohio City. To boot the food was amazing.

Beer list was impressive, but the wine list left a little something to be desired.

Be forewarned, seating is limited to 16 approx. 

And, if the weather is in the single digits, the place will reflect it. (I.e. be smarter than my date and I, dont sit by the windows).
