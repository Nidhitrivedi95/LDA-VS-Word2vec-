htQgj-ANQpZGpIpkkrEmyQ This was my first time here after hearing and seeing all the great things. 

We started off with the "Extra Butter" coconut shrimp. This was delicious, I would definitely recommend and re-order.

I had the Hanoi Chilled Beef Salad. It was very filling and coming from a Vietnamese background, this dish was very similar to the foods that my mother makes. The beef was nice and tender and cooked to perfection ( nice medium rare).

My boyfriend had the Japanese Squid Buffalo Burger. This was something different so we wanted to give it a try. This burger is exploding with a lot of bold flavours and finishes off with some lemongrass notes. If you are not a fan of lemongrass, then I would not suggest getting the burger. My boyfriend does not like lemongrass too much but he did not mind the burger. 

The service was great. Although there were only two servers, they made sure every table was attended to and got what they needed. 

I am already planning my next visit back here!
