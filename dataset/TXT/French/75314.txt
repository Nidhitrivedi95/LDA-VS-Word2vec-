The food, however was nothing short of mind-blowing. I got to share with my friends on the table, and we tried the mussels, the lamb shank, the cornish hen and a steak together. Every single dish was cooked to perfection and flavored perfectly. There was no overdose of cheese or spices.
The wine pairing was good too, though a bit priced. But the food compensates in pricing as well - don't remember having a lamb shank for $25 - especially this tasty.
This would be 5-star except for the boring neighborhood. Definitely check it out.
