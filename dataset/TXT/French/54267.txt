rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw My husband and I wanted to have a light healthy meal and we were really happy with the choices at Bardot Brasserie. He had the Salmon over Lentils. We also ordered chickpea fries and beet salad.

The funny thing was when we sat down our waiter greeted us with a "French" accent...my husband is English but also speaks French and turned to me and said that he doesn't really speak French...:)

We ordered a glass of wine and were really shocked at how small a pour it was..it was below the mid-line of glass and my husband mentioned it to the waiter when he went by him.

The waiter did come back to our table and filled up his wine glass, so we really appreciated the gesture..One thing to point out is that he LOST his French accent and became an American...

The food was great.
