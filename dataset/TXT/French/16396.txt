7Ym8NVxTO9b1FLGeWGp_Fg Great addition to downtown Markham as I love French bistro myself.  The chef/owner has worked in many well known restaurants around the world and created an interesting French inspired menu.  I attended on a private night with a 7 courses tasting menu.  The star is definitely the miso black cod with spinach risotto!  Lots of their dishes uses liquid nitrogen and I look forward for their wine list to be finalize.
