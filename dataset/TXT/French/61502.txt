SJo_IjvzdRtCvZVN0cbrRQ I can not possibly say enough good things about this place. It took my husband and I a while to get around to going - despite that several people we knew mentioned it and  told us how much we would love it. When we finally arrived we were in love. The food is of a quality that I honestly haven't found in the area before. Their specials are amazing, thoughtful, complex and well presented. The pastries are perfect, french pastries like you can hardly find in Ohio. Make sure you share a croissant while you are waiting for your meal. They do a simple jam & croissant so well....!

The coffee is also good - and I am pretty picky about my coffee. Try the hot chocolate if that is more your thing. 

My only complaint is that is it always busy (rightly so) on the weekends when I am in Ohio....
