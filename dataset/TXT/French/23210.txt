C3PVq7UpeHd6nz1_e-AtkA It's been on my list to visit for years and now is my new favourite restaurant. 

Inside its reminiscent of a French Bistro. The menu an eclectic mix of Indian inspired foods but without being too ethic or fusiony. 

For brunch you'll get the regular fare with the "Scrolls" , roti wrapped with stuffings like eggplant, hummus , peppers and artichokes. A half scroll $11.95 was more than enough for one person. 

Also had the eggs napoleon. Poached eggs on to of a croissant (they had me at croissant) covered in a dill cream sauce. Also the roasted potatoes were excellent and crispy on the outside /soft on the inside. 

The bottomless coffee was actually very good. Rich and nutty in flavour. Not watery. 

My new favourite place not just for brunch but I noticed also their extensive beer / cider (including growers) at around $5 per pint/bottle. The desserts also looked really good too. 

The place is bigger than it meets the eye. Thy take reservations for lunch and dinner. Not brunch but at 11:30am Sunday morning there were plenty of seats. 

I would recommend dates,groups , even parents.
