4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I was so excited to try this place out and left disappointed. The prices were reasonable, but the food wasn't the best. We started with the seafood platter which was good, probably the best part of the meal! Everything about this platter was delicious. But when it came to our main courses, they were alright. I got the steak classique and frites, the fries were pretty good, nice and crispy. The steak was very chewy though, I only finished half of it because it was so chewy. My boyfriend ordered the bass special and the fish was tasty! The sides didn't pair very well with the fish though. Our server was nice, but he forgot to put our main course order in so we were there for almost two hours total. It was a pretty long wait just to get the check as well. Overall, if anything, I would come back for the seafood platter and the baguette but nothing else really stood out.
