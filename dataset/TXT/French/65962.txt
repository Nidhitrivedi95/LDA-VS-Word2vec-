udFcIcbWbxrO8uLF95WnQg Well...disappointing. We saw others review this place and thought we would give it a try. The atmosphere was nice but we were sat in the back room and it was about 80 degrees. The tables were so close together and there was no music so we felt awkward to even talk. Our server was not good. We felt beyond rushed. We were going to a play after but we planned accordingly and had two and a half hours to relax and have a nice dinner. The food came out about 5 minutes after we ordered. At certain places that's a good thing...not at what is framed to be a nice fine dining restaurant. Our server spoke very loudly (again in a small room). He was pretty tacky - making bad jokes and barely able to make suggestions about the menu or wine. We waited longer for our plates to be cleared and our check than we did for our food.

The food was bland and very over priced in our opinion. My husband had the trout and I had the beef shoulder. Neither was very good. My beef was swimming in a tasteless broth with spinach and roasted tomatoes. It was tender but not flavorful. The trout tasted like nothing. The mashed potatoes were good but with two dinners and two drinks we spent over $80 including the tip.

With as many options as Cleveland has now, I'm not sure they'll be able to compete. They are probably busy because of the close proximity to the theaters. We won't be back.
