4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw The four stars are for the absolutely awesome service! Our waiter was perfectly attentive in just the right way. My hubby only had to ask once for more cream, from that point on it was brought automatically. 

I decided to order the Nutella Waffle and a side of Date-Glazed Bacon. Instead of the large waffle covered in Nutella I was imagining, my plate had five mini waffles dusted with powdered sugar. Upon closer inspection I could see that the Nutella was actually baked inside the waffles. I immediately covered each waffle with the provided syrup and whipped cream (they give the perfect amount of each). The edges of the waffles had quite a crisp to them and the center was pretty full of Nutella. 

The bacon was decently thick cut and nicely cooked, but I have to say that the date flavor didn't really come through....

My husband, on the other hand, was absolutely smitten with his Eggs Benedict Special. He said it had the most delicate hollandaise sauce he'd ever tasted and that the chives on top provided the perfect punch of flavor. 

I would suggest downloading the app Lettuce Entertain You so you can get points every time you eat here. Also, make your reservation on Open Table so you can get points there, too.
