rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Incredible! I was already a huge fan of Thomas Keller after dining at The French Laundry awhile ago, and after hearing (and reading) great things about Bouchon, I decided to try it out for dinner with my bf on our trip to Vegas.

For starters, we ordered a 3 cheese sampler plate and seafood platter. The cheeses were great; we ordered 1 cow's milk, 1 goat's milk, and 1 sheep's milk cheese. The seafood platter came with shrimp, clams, mussels, oysters, and lobster tail -- great variety!

For entrees, we ordered the pork loin (me) and leg of lamb (him). The pork loin was delicious! Not dry at all and very tasty. Of course, by that time I was already getting pretty full, but finished my course nonetheless. I tried some of the lamb as well, which was nice and tender.

For dessert, we ordered the creme brulee. YUM! Can't go wrong there. Everything was washed down with an amazing bottle of Pinot Noir from Hirsch Vineyards (recommendation by our server).

Overall, this was a delicious meal with incredible service. The attention to detail was apparent in everything. Thomas Keller can do no wrong in my book! :)
