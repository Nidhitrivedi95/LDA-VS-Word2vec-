A8yIKHSI5LFYZ6_H8dZBcg I went in to Chefydrews this evening for the first time to get some takeout. Firstly, I was very impressed with the variety of dishes on the menu. For a small restaurant they are serving an interesting variety. The sign out front reads "International Cuisine with a Caribbean flair", and that sums it up quite well. On the menu you'll find caribbean standards next to dishes like  shrimp scampi and osso buco (I can't wait to return to try the latter). I had the jerk chicken with rice and peas and steamed vegetables, and it really was excellent. The portion was a very good size for the price (7.95), and the steamed carrots and broccoli were perfect- a refreshing change from the usual lump of soggy coleslaw served at most jerk joints. I also had a beef patty which was equally delicious. I had a very pleasant chat with a gentleman who I believe was the owner/manager/chefydrew himself, and the server who was working was also very friendly. Please don't let the area this restaurant is in deter you. It's what is on the inside that matters, and in this case it's very clean, new restaurant serving great food. I live in the neighborhood and I know this is a tough spot to make a go of it. So do yourself and the neighborhood a favor and go support this local small business!
