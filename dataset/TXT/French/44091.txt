MdjIl105vqCYUGKFSUVytA This place is beautiful! Everything starting from the decorations to the plates and cutlery was too quality. I honestly couldn't stop turning around to see what else they've got)))
The food in my opinion was good, but my friend said its nothing special. I found that they have pretty interesting selection, so I tried a little bit of almost everything. 
Excellent service as well. Our waiter was super nice and would refresh our drinks and plates just when we needed it. 
This place is very pricey, I paid close to a $100 for my brunch, but I think it was worth it. 
I will definitely be coming back here!
