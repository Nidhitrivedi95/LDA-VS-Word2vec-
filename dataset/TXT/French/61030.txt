SFnrHuVFSNiondFVUBLJZQ Well.. quite disappointed with the price for the quality... Decided to go there as several places had crazy wait times and this place didn't and was rated 4+ stars on Yelp. Fondues are really pricey for the quality of the meat, and vegetables plates don't necessarily go well with cheese fondue. Nice deserts and friendly service though. May have to try other items , but I would suggest to stay away from the fondues
