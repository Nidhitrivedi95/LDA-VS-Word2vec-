Kut9tVbDX_f7qKMRRoXg3w I found this place while wandering around town. They weren't super busy, and they had eye catching decor. The wait staff were courteous and attentive without being overly hovering. Their menu isn't huge, but I got the impression that all of the items on it were carefully thought out and that there was a little something for everyone. I wound up getting crepes with ham, green apple, and brie. It came with a lovely little side salad, and all of the food was faintly sweet in flavor. Very good.
