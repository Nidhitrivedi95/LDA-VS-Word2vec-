KxUczoGoAwkX9mSHwWlUAw Went here on my New Year's Montreal stint...great place to start the night or hang out if you're having too much fun to leave. 

Atmosphere is great - the space is modern and feels cozy despite the fact that it's a decent size. The ambiance was good, the DJ was playing some good lounge music that got a little louder and more upbeat as the night went on. Service was ...ok, I'd say friendlier than most Montreal restos we popped into. I tipped 20% out of habit and the waitress came over to say a personal thank you which was sweet. They also treated us with a glass of champagne, compliments of the restaurant and our hotel (we made a reservation through the concierge).

Food was good and the portions were fair. It wasn't a WOW taste, but it's not the kind of place you go for a culinary experience. It wasn't bad by any means and I thought it was priced well. We spent about 4 hours here and I would definitely go back.

Foodwise: foie gras and squash ravioli - good, but the raviolis were too thick; bison tartare - really good; sea bass tartare - very good with the sweet potato chips; steak looked delicious
