rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw Have been wanting to try Bardot since I saw the ads for it during summer time. Long story short did not disappoint at all. The courses were timed perfectly, the service was amazing and helped make the meal. Onto the food every course was great a must try would be the duck wings and the chocolate macaron for dessert.
