KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA We had such a great experience! Delicious food, I had the chicken frites (melt in your mouth) picked up a bottle of wine from the store selection to enjoy with lunch. Only complaint is that they failed to mention the $10 corking fee to walk the bottle 10ft to there restaurant.
