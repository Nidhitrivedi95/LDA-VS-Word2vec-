udFcIcbWbxrO8uLF95WnQg Not very impressed with this restaurant.... We heard so much and was really excited to try it out on our special date night out. We could only get reservations at 4pm for dinner so we thought wow, it must a fantastic place!! 

First off, before we could order anything, the bread served was not warm and we found a strand of hair in the olive oil..... Big uh-oh. 
Next, we ordered escargots as an appetizer. The escargots were bland and portion was smaller than expected. 

The servers came asking for our orders 5-6 times before we were ready and we felt like we were being rushed to get out so they could prepare our table for the next diner.

Valet parking costs $10, be warned!

Also another warning: Restaurant week 3 course meal menu is extremely limited, not a good representative of what this restaurant has to offer
