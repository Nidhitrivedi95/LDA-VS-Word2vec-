rrfe1RPh6t3QG7BRghzjYA Full disclosure: I lived in France for 6 years, so I'm always a bit skeptical of "authentic" French cuisine in the US. However, the food here is so true to its roots that it will remind you of your favorite bistro in Paris! 

We've been here several times and never had a dish that wasn't AMAZING! I always get the daily Foie Gras appetizer which never disappoints. In addition to the stellar food, the service is superior. During our New Year's Eve dinner, each of the waiters we've had in the past year stopped by our table to say hello and wish us a happy new year. Really great people!
