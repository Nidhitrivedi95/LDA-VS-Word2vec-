fFInb4Dl2Ix4iE-VOltbkQ One of the best restaurants in the Old Town of Montreal, we ate here primarily because we were staying at the attached hotel, the Nelligan.  

The atmosphere is very cool, especially since we sat by the window and could gawk at people as they walked by late on a busy Saturday night.

The wine list is extensive, but very expensive.  I had an excellent glass of barolo - the best glass of wine I would have in Montreal, but it cost me $21.  

The most memorable dish we had were the elk medallions, although it wouldn't be the best elk we tried in Quebec (that honor goes to the blue cheese/elk turnovers in Charlevoix).  The lobster was also very good, but not as fresh as I would have expected.  

The dessert was a delicious maple-syrup infused baba.  It was surprisingly light and subtle, although if I were ordering again, I would probably go with a different dessert option.

Definitely worth trying if you're looking for a special meal in the Old Port area.  There are a lot of touristy places a few blocks away that don't offer nearly the quality.
