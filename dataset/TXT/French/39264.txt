jSfnItqaOnEp2nenVF7fCg We have dined several times at Amuse Bouche for lunch and keep going back for one reason - the food is great.  

One of the highlights on the lunch menu is the Cabernet burger.  The couple sitting at the table next to us each had the burger and we overheard their comments as follows: "this burger changed my life" said the man.  The woman called a friend and said "this is the best burger I've ever had in my life.  I didn't even need to add ketchup!"  I think that about says it all.  I've also had the Cabernet burger, and it is really great.

But that's not all that is on the menu.  You can start with their pâté which is wonderful (although they could give you a few more bits of toasted bread because you run out of them before you run out of pâté).  Their salads are delicious and plentiful.  The sandwiches are great.  I had the Parisian sandwich on my most recent visit (with black forest ham, hard-boiled eggs, cheese, etc., on a baguette) and a wonderful side salad.  I've also had the Panini's, including the Cuban and the lamb.  They are both excellent.

And finally, the French fries.  They are beer battered and served piping hot.  It is worth going there just to have the fries.

As other commenters have noted, this is a very small place, but the service is excellent and the food is terrific.  You should give it a try.
