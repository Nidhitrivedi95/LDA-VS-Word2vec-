4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Came here for brunch with my cousin and her husband. This is my second time here. The food is really good. Last time though they had a bloody mary bar (bloody marys are my favvv) and this time they didn't :( 

Try sitting in the atrium - the lighting is great in there. This time we sat inside because that's all they had and it was a bit too dark. I imagine sitting on the patio and people watching would be cool too!
