oS96aJIHFWcFAlGHKKXjaw I live dangerously close to La Gourmadine, and I'll admit it takes quite a bit of self-control to reserve this as an occasional treat. It's a tiny little place, but the number of items offered never ceases to surprise me. They have a huge variety of breads, pastries, and some savory items like sandwiches and quiche. On a weekend morning you can expect a line, but it moves quickly and you'll be outside enjoying your treats in no time at all.

Two of my favorite items:

The macarons aux framboises is essentially two giant macarons with fresh raspberries and a lychee cream in the center. The macarons are perfect, with that deliciously chewy outer shell and soft inside. The cream and strawberries make a wonderful combination, and overall it's a really refreshing treat. 

The marquise is an elongated bar covered in flawless chocolate and beautifully decorated with gold leaf and some other embellishments. Inside are layers of chocolate mousse, creme brulee, and a crispy caramel crust. The flavor combination is spot-on; it's not overly rich or heavy, but just right.

If you're in the area, I definitely recommend stopping in. You will not be disappointed!
