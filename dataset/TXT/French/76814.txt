ysJo5Jdo29XOBCnKrbUKWg Sigh...I hate writing negative reviews...I really do.  But our experience yesterday was far from what I was hoping or expecting.  

After waiting about 45 mins for a table for 4 people for Sunday Brunch (which is about the norm) we were seated outside on the patio on a beautiful sunny day.  Alot of the reviews speak of people greeting you, maybe even in French, as you enter the building.  Well none of this happened to us.  Which is fine, just don't say that it happens if there are no intentions of doing so.

Anyway, our waiter comes over and greets us.  Upon placing our drink orders we are given 2 cups that have food and lipstick on them.  He apologizes, brings a new coffee cup, as well as picks up a container of milk from another table and gives it to us to use.  Well needless to say the milk is curdled from the sun so we had to send another cup of coffee back.  

Our food comes.  I ordered soup but was given salad.  My friend ordered a vegetarian crepe; it was served with ham.  My other friend ordered a side of mustard and none was given.  The crepe was sent back, my soup was brought out this time...without a spoon.  LOL.  It was just one of those days where if it could go wrong, it did go wrong.

The waiter was obviously overworked.  Each time someone new was set in his area he would roll his eyes and groan in disgust...loud enough for everyone to hear.  Very unprofessional.  The bill was dropped off, but after waiting 20 minutes for his return, we decided to just leave the money and go...not even a goodbye was given from anyone in this restaurant.  If this is Paris I have no desire to go back again.

The food was delicious but certainly not worth the hassle.
