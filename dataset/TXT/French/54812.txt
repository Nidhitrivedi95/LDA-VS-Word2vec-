rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw I truly wish I could give half stars sometimes. This restaurant really did come in between a 3 and a 4 for me. I went here during a work conference trip with some coworkers when we were trying to escape yet another vendor dinner. The decor is absolutely beautiful and definitely makes you feel like you are in the Aria. It's very French classic. That part of it I will say, was a five star. 

For food, I started with the onion soup (as did all three of my coworkers) and it was phenomenal! It was the biggest bowl of onion soup I have ever had in my life and quite possibly the tastiest. There was a ton of bread, a ton of onions, and a ton of cheese - it was everything French onion soup should be. Quite honestly, you can eat this as your meal, it was that much food. Because I had this rich soup, I decided to do a lighter dinner and had the mussels. The mussels were definitely prepared well, they had no grit or sand and they were all steamed open - for me, the miss here was simply the flavor. I also tried my coworkers gnocchi which was heavenly but a very heavy dish as well. I mean for crying out loud this is French food so richness, I guess is something that should be expected.

The service was lackluster and our server was not knowledgeable which for a restaurant of this caliber was extremely disappointing and definitely tainted the experience.

All things considered, this was a very nice restaurant and I would certainly go back to have some french onion soup if nothing else.
