GS06uO84yKQpa7oezgVZgQ Funny thing about Edinburgh . . .some of the best food I had on my trip was at French restaurants and not Scottish!  And Cafe Saint Honore was no exception!

Located a little off the beaten path (the address says Thistle Street but it's more on an off shoot alley of Thistle but that may be just how they do it here) Cafe Saint Honore did it up right for me on my last night in Edinburgh.

This charming place is quaint mixed with some Old World Charm that makes it the perfect place for a special dinner or date.  We sat on the main level in the front room and had both excellent service and excellent food.

The bread comes up warm and crunchy served with fresh butter.  The wine list is not huge but large enough where you can find something that is perfect for your evening.  It was warm on the night we were there and the house Sauvingon Blanc, while a little fruity, was quite good.

For my starter I went with the risotto with goats cheese and my friend had the pork rillette.  Both were good and very flavorful.  I had the sea bream served over vegetables as my entree and my friend went with the lamb.  Here again- they were cooked perfectly with plenty of contrasting flavors.

For dessert they served something of a deconstructed strawberry shortcake and clotted cream.  Delicious!  Somehow the berries in Scotland are so much sweeter tasting than the ones I get at home.

A lovely restaurant, a lovely setting.  If you like French food- Cafe Saint Honore should be on your list to try.
