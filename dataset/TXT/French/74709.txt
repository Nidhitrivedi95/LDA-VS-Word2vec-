xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g Just to let you know, most of the restaurants I've been to have a drive through, so fancy pants places really don't impress me. The hope is that the food is good, the service excellent, yadda yadda.

And in my book, this place is just okay -- especially considering the prices.

First off, we didn't really make reservations, so they sat us away from the windows facing that way cool Bellagio water show. The date asked about it, and the fancy-pants hostess make some comment that was like "oh, those seats are for reserved guests." 

Okay, whatever, you lose a star for not seeing a couple that was willing to pay for the place.

Now I actually thought the walk past the kitchen was cool, because it was SPOTLESS. Not bad. You get back part of a star.

The service was pleasant, but I thought a bit over-frenchified like they were trying too hard to be French without them being French. If you have a French restaurant and you expect people to pay $90 a person, they better speak French. You lose another star, my friend.

The duck was a bit "tough", and figuring this was a fancy pants Paris restaurants, you would think that the duck would have been better. The venison was good. The date had a souffle. It was cool how they poured the sauces in, but the souffle wasn't "top notch."

Nice place? Sure, can't beat the view, it you get one of those tables.

Would I go back? No. This is one of those enforced fancy restaurants for the masses -- bring in the celebrity chef to create a menu, and serve high priced average food to people that don't better.
