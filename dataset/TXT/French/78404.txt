YVYHX7RCPjCBqEth2CS91Q Brasserie 33 was great for a casual Sunday date with my girlfriend. 

Their outdoor seating is right on Ellsworth Ave, which makes for great people watching, but you do have to pause conversations to accomodate the occasional passing motorcycle.

My Lamb was a seemed a little pricey at ~30$, but there was more than enough for dinner, plus a box for lunch the next day, and the flavor was delicious.  My GF's chicken was also very good and a sizeable portion, but again, 24$ is a bit high for a half free range chicken.

The ambience is interesting as the actual restaurant and outdoor seating area are well decorated and front on Ellsworth with its old homes and boutique shopping.  However, the restaurant entrance is located on a small "strip mall" with a laundromat, beer distributor, and japanese grocer.  Definitely does not provide the "Wow" factor right off the bat.

Our waiter was polite, social, spoke broken French to us, and generally made the experience a pleasure.  His food recommendations were spot on, but some diners may have found him obtrusive.  Our food took awhile to come out and he apologized to us and attempted to expedite the situation without us asking for it.  A sign of a good waiter.

Overall, I was very pleased, but without a Groupon deal or coupon, this restaurant is just a little too expensive considering the cheaper, but comparably flavored restaurants nearby.
