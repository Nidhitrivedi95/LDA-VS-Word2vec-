I have nothing to say about their tea service, and I used to chuckle at the touristy nature of a piano man playing "Can You Feel The Love Tonight?" at this bar in the heart of Bellagio's lobby, but mine eyes have seen thy light. And by the light, I mean that being served a nice glass of Pinot Noir and a chalice full of snacks by a man in a vest while listening to a stunning version of "When You Wish Upon A Star" on the piano has a surprisingly calming effect on me. It's better than therapy I think, and even though I didn't see a list of fancy, specialty cocktails, I liked the feeling that I could become a regular there. That the man in the vest would remember my name, and that I could dine on endless cups of sesame sticks while requesting my favorite Disney songs.
