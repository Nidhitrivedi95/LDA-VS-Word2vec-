fVF5wayDyY6ZR5oJB1IK3g I found Lawrence with the help of the Yelp app on my iPhone. Glad I did. The reviews were quite glowing and I think if I had been sharing the experience with someone else it would have been even better. I noticed they stopped serving brunch at 4pm; so I hurried over from Cafe Olimpico a few blocks away. The pretty bright dining room was half empty and so taking a table for one didn't seem so awkward. The service was warm and friendly and my eggs and salmon were delicious. All in all, a positive experience but one best shared.
