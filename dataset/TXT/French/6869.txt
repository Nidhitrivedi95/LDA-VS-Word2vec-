4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I came with high expectatio expectations after hearing friends rave about the place.

The complimentary apple chutney and crisp baguette was a lovely starter.

I got the onion au gratin while my partner got the half roast chicken. The chicken was mouthwateringly moist with a crispy skin. The mashed potato side was creamy and delicious and the accompanying bacon, onion, and mushroom mix was perfectly done as well.

But my onion soup was a huge disappointment. The flavor had a bitter aftertaste and the gyuere cheese on top was already sunken into the soup, leaving it a gloppy mess instead of a crisp crust. Definitely not worth $10.

Overall, it was a good experience with a wonderful view as well, but skip the onion soup!
