BSmqxPbQglQwP2R56OqOag We were looking for a nearby location that served bottomless mimosas with brunch and we stumbled upon Local Bistro.  We went around 10:30 am on a Saturday and it was mostly empty except for a couple of people so we elected to sit at the bar.  The bar stools were awesome - cushioned and swivel.  The entire inside is clean and nicely decorated - good atmosphere.  And unlike most places in Phoenix the entire bar is inside which is nice for really hot days to ensure there is ample room at the bar.

The bottomless mimosas (or bloody marys) are $12 and our server truly never let us see the bottom of our glass, even three hours later.  We asked selected the drunken enchiladas which were chicken enchiladas with 2 over easy eggs and the short rib omelette based on our servers top two recommendations.  The food was in general pretty good/not bad.  It wasn't amazing and my eggs were slightly (just slightly) overcooked (brunch sin!).  The short rib had a lot of flavor though.  

We would definitely return based on the great service, bottomless mimosas, good atmosphere, and decent food.
