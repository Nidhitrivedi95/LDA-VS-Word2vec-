xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g I almost never go to any of the restaurants on the Strip anymore since they're generally very overpriced, overrated and too damn touristy. But when it comes to entertaining out of town Japanese guests, this place was a very good choice.
I'm gonna keep this one short and simple. We got very good service and food. I do understand that prices will be high for this sort of thing but the quality was there. Servers were very attentive and were very patient in explaining everything on the menu as well as offering fine suggestions with wine pairings. 
The view.... this is why you come to this restaurant over others. The view of the strip was spectacular. Overlooking Bellagio, you can view the fountain shows (Minus the audio) while enjoying your meal. For couples, they have you facing outward as well for a nice extra touch.
You have to kind of get lucky to get this view seating however. Even if you make a reservation, when you show up, you can be seated right away to an available table, or you'll be asked to wait if you want a view table. We waited about 45 minutes for a view table which at first irritated me, but afterwards, I'm so glad we did. 
If you're a tourist, or a local that is entertaining tourists, then this is a good place to make a good impression.
