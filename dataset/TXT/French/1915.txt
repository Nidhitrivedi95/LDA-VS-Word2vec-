The Brussels sprouts were to-die for. I could've eaten that as my entree. The cauliflower, on the other hand, was so-so.

The fish and chicken were out of this world! My boyfriend and I were so stuffed by the end of the meal because we are every last bite.

I gave it four stars because, although I live in NYC, it was quite pricey (we didn't even get wine because it was so expensive). Definitely worth going to for a special occasion and for an incredible meal.
Made our Montreal visit lovely.
