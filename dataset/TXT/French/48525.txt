ohMpNug5zWNxOlL6ShG7Ig LOL @ 1-star review. That's hilarious, really.

Cafe Bink seems to be the much more approachable little sister of Binkley's. It's situated right along Tom Darlington (Scottsdale Rd) just before you hit Cave Creek. Simple little strip mall location, with an interesting shade-sailed patio. A little close to the road noise, but great views to the West. This is a real new bistro menu, and from I've had so far, it's wonderfully executed.

SETTING
Scenic, if you ignore the stripmall to the East. Carefree/Cave Creek is a different beast than it was 10 years ago, for better and for worse.

SERVICE
Our amiable but ditsy server managed to get everything out in order, and with a smile.

FOOD
Just look for the pictures from Ron B above. That's my review. Plus the 5 stars. Only thing I will say is: best frites in town. Wish they had a straight up Aioli. And the green dipping sauce was just "off" somehow for my taste. Otherwise... well I gave it 5 stars.

BOTTOM LINE
If you get near it for some reason, check it out for lunch or dinner.
