The four stars are for the kindly concept of a non-profit restaurant with volunteers who get to learn about restaurant cooking while supporting good projects; and for the stiff drinks we had there; and for the beautiful wooden stage and piano and performances by the band and string section last night at the album launch we attended. Robin des Bois is hosting lots of shows these days and it's really a great space for some cozy, heart-warming live music and dining.
