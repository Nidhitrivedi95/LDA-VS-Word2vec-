rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw I love Michael Mina and have enjoyed his other restaurants in the past.  I wanted to love Bardot but ended up "only liking" it.  Why?  Because they were out of 75% of what I wanted -- sparkling wine from burgundy : out, Michael Mina Cabernet Sauvignon : out, mussels : out.   Clearly Sunday night is not a good night.

The warm beet and goat cheese was fantastic and a generous portion.  My friend had the french onion soup which she said was good.  I'm still unsure about the mussels.  Our server took the order and returned 10 minutes later to say they were unavailable because the chef didn't want anything of inferior quality to leave the kitchen. Was I the first order of mussels for the day (9p)? Or the last and those mussels were dead?

However, as disappointing as the food was, the service was excellent. The sommelier gave good substitute recommendations and we received a chocolate macaroon complimentary.  One of the dining room managers came over to apologize as well.  I'd give if a 2nd try but wouldn't put it above any of my other favorite Vegas restaurants.
