LHwzyN5cllTfLuZ8v2k_Bg This is a cozy french restaurant. It is the closest to a typical french restaurant you can find in France in Toronto. I've had the charcuterie and escargot to start. For the main, I've tried the salmon, the travers de boeuf, and the foie de veau. Everything was tasty. I've been with a group of 6 or more multiple times and we've always had a good time.
