4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Went here for dinner while inn Vegas. It was ok, nothing to write home about. we had a baked scallop appetizer. Very small portion for the price. The scallops were cut in half. My wife had the steak frites and i had the duck and pork belly cassolet. they were both good, but again, not great. Ask the waiter to take our picture because it was our wedding anniversary. He was more concerned about getting the name of the restaurant in the shot that he almost cut our heads off in the picture.
