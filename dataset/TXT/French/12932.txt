weekends only brunch... the most amazing french toast I have ever had. It was perfect! they serve it with syrup on the side, but it is the only french toast I've ever had that did not need any syrup, it would have ruined the perfectness of what was on the plate!!
French TOast:
-perfectly cooked so the center wasn't gooey
-very thick bread (at least an inch)
-thick homemade whipped cream that was not too sweet
-bursting blueberries that were a perfect combination!!

My hubby had the onion soup which he says is the best he's ever had (and he's a huge fan of onion soup!) & the steak sandwich, which he rates as a 5 out of 10, so perhaps you should just order the french toast if you make it to breakfast!!

Go! Go! GO! Best of all you can sit outside and people watch and watch the watershow!! Mon Ami Gabi!!
