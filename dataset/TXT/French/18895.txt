I never had a macaron before, and really enjoyed the crunchy outside complimented by the truffle like center.  I tried the rose macaron first, then followed it up with Madagascar Black Vanilla.  This second one hooked me!  It was nothing short of exquisite, with flavor that really grew as the center melted in my mouth.

Go there soon while the lines are short!
