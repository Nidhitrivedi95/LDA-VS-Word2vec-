XZ7eQLjyGXf6y69UT4SGhg On entering this small bakery I heard a chorus of "Monsieur Westie" emanating from the pastry display case which included the most eye appealing croissants and other pastries I have ever found in Las Vegas. I was sorely tempted by those little voices, but I chose La Chevrotine gallete - chevre, mushroom and bacon that was a bit dry. My wife's sugar deficiency was (temporarily) satisfied by the Breizh crepe - caramel, butter, baked apple and whipped cream that brought a smile to her face and a vow to return. Though the restaurant no longer participates in restaurant.com, chef/owner Pierre Gatel allowed me to use one.
