SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA What a wonderful place to dine! The food has a very "French countryside" feel that is full of flavor and approachable. The atmosphere is modern and comfortable from my perspective. The service at the table was professional and admired from a fellow foodservice professional! I must also commend the wine list; wonderful choice, not too daunting, and well laid out. If I lived a little closer it would be a regular stop for sure, but my occasional visit to Cleveland will surely warrant a visit.
Thank you, L'albratros!
