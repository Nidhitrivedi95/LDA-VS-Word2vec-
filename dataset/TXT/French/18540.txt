aaWhSHpsE285eaSTzDxAMA You can tell this is a chef run spot. The food was good, but the front of the house needs major help. Our waitress, Melissa, was rude and not attentive. I have dietary restrictions and none of them were met (e.g. Sauce on side.) She was not helpful and sloppy. I'm annoyed bc the food was good, and it's convenient location wise, but I won't be going back for a long time. PS. It was not cheap .. so we expected WAY better service. Blah.
