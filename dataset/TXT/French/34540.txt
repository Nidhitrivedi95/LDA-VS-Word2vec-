HojKatUfX4UHWaPqtl63NQ Great meal I had at Rivea, bravo to chef Bruno and his team ,our server Bianca recommended the duck and the lobster they were on point! Oh! Save room for the ZUCCOTTO is enough to share between 2-3 people! After the meal then you should head to sky fall lounge next door for a nightcap.
