aaWhSHpsE285eaSTzDxAMA Went last night for one of their VEGAN nights and my tastebuds were dancing. I wish I could go back and have it all again tonight!

It was a 3 for $30 and included a Grilled Caesar Salad, a Barbecue Tofu over a roasted sweet potato and this amazing grilled corn and edamame succotash, and this sweet little jalapeno cornbread, and then a strawberry shortcake complete with vegan ice cream to finish.

I have been a vegetarian for over 20 years, and have not had a great version of a Caesar until last night - Bistro 185 finally nailed a vegan caesar salad! 

It was one of those meals where every other word out of my mouth was OMG. Thank you Bistro 185! Absolutely delicious.
