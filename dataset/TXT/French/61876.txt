They have outdoor seating if you happen to be visiting on a day that's less than 100° it might be nice to sit out there. The food is pricey, but it really is gosh darn good. I have the chicken schnitzel sandwich, with a side of fries. My lunch date had the salmon tacos. Good portion for lunch. Service is excellent. Parking underground is covered and free. Hardly ever a wait.
