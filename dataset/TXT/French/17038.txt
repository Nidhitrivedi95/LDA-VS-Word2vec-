9ET_RUNztevq4_OLAX80Gg What to say about Cafe Boulud?
-located in the beautiful new Four Seasons hotel in Yorkville. 
- nice ambiance 
- music encourages hearing your table mates. :-)
- modern clean line vibe
- pleasant staff and servers 

We checked it out for Summerlicious. 
We tried:
- the pork rillette to start
- I had the chicken (a generous portion and moist!) Hubby had the sole meunière. Very nice. 
- He had the chocolate cake (small portion) and I had the Paris Brest.  Lovely with a custard cream. 

Cocktails and wine were both very expensive. 
That's what you get in Yorkville! 

Regular menu looked good but pricey. 
It was good but I have enjoyed other high end restaurants more.   I never balk at paying for a great place with fab food. There are others in the area I would go to again over this spot. 

Just my 10 cents. :-)
