AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw One of the places I visited when I came to Vegas for the weekend. The first thing the waitress told us was that they're told that they have the best eggs beni, and wow, she was not lying. I'm usually stear away from eggs beni because of the sauce, but it just sounded amazing I had to try it. I ordered the lobster eggs benedict, and I'm so glad I did. I did not want it to end. I ordered a mocha as well, which was really good. I also went to the little shop next door to get some french macaroons, which were a perfect little dessert! Would definitely go back when I visit Vegas again!
