ANHCo9X7zu0LdYecc9fk3Q Definitely a disappointment compared to other delicious dining options in this airport. Had the spinach salad and it was haphazardly thrown together--old strawberries, weird grilled chicken (it had been over marinated) and a strange flavor combo. I honestly just ate it because I had to rush to my flight. 

What's weird, it seemed a general manager was there overseeing operations with the local manager. As I sat down, I was shocked to see dirty tables, a dirty floor, a HUGE puddle of water (that I pointed out to them) and mostly indifferent staff. If this is how they act while the BOSS is here, how is it when he is gone?
