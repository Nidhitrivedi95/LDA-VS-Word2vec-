4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I was excited to try this place due to the popularity on yelp and booked it the day before New Year's Eve. We were running late and I called to say so since we had booked it on OpenTable. They said ok, and we were seated promptly upon arrival. Within 10 minutes, I received an email from OpenTable saying I had a no-show - uhh, ok. Someone at the front doesn't know how to use their computer.  

We were seated next to the atrium along the right side (facing the street). Our server (brunette, middle aged woman with bangs) came by to take our order and I asked how big the half serving of mussels were: she said 8 pieces. I've never heard of such a small serving before and I assumed they must be big. I said I'll take the full one and she said "it's 16 pieces". When it came out the mussels were tiny and there were way more than "16". They were forgettable. She ignored us the rest of the evening but was attentive to the table of 4 next to us, taking time to explain the dishes that were brought to their table. Great, I didn't feel any discrimination at all. /sarcasm

Our young busboy, however, was a true gem and the only saving grace of this place. He came by constantly to refill our waters and replied "yes, ma'am" when I said thank you. Our server even just stacked all the dishes on this poor boy and told him to finish clearing our table but personally cleared the table next to us. When we were leaving, he even said "thank you, happy new year". 

I should've gotten his name, but management needs to promote that guy because he will bring customers back and knows what service is about. He has great potential and is hardworking, so I hope someone notices.
