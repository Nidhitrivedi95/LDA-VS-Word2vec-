rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Beautiful and lax ambiance with impeccable service. The service was so good that my coworker walked in with an empty señor frogs cup and the hostess just giggled at us and said she would take care of it. I knew it would be a great spot as we were automatically treated with respect.

We each started with a glass of bourdeaux and snacked on the complimentary bread pretzel stick and pistachios. We then each had a french onion soup and split the goat cheese salad, liver pate, and escargot. Was pleasantly surprised at how great the escargot was (served with a pastry puff on top). The goat cheese was served warn on the salad, which was dressed to perfection. The liver pate had a strong bay leaf flavor but was still great. Delicious french food and not overly expensive.
