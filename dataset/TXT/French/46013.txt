mVZoin0a8uTZgLsgJ9iNDQ D splashed out for a fancy dinner here for our last celebratory occasion and the food did not disappoint. However the service wasn't QUITE up to par for the price point. I attribute this to the fact that we were sat in the room furthest away from the kitchen, but still...  we were sat at a small table in a somewhat awkward corner under the GIANT grandfather clock (which I LOVE!), tho I was next to the radiator, so not too many complaints there! It was right next to the door which led to the loos, so we got quite a lot of foot traffic during our meal which I didn't really like. 

I was rather gutted they were out of scallops as the scallops with pork belly and apple sauce sounds divine! I settled for a lobster cocktail instead which was delightfully paired with a tomato confit and delectable, although the gem lettuce left a slightly bitter aftertaste. D had foie, duck & figs which was delicious.

We both had the venison and there were two very very clean plates at the end. My chocolate fondant pudding was rich and decadent and mmmmmmmmm...  I probably would have licked the plate if there hadn't been anyone else in the room! D's bakewell tart wasn't half bad either. ; )

If it wasn't for the slightly lacking service (which really wasn't THAT lacking compared to anywhere else), I'm just being finnicky because when I pay a certain price point for my dinner, I expect a certain level of service and I felt The Grain Store fell down a bit on it. Would I let it stop me visiting again? Certainly not! Especially with a 3 course lunch menu at £15.95 or the likes...  Will def have to stop in for lunch one of these days!

Splash out for the food, it's worth it!
