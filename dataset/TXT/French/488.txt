-Mz3M0g6iFZczs6a7ddf5g This restaurant is amazing. We had a team dinner here today and our team is admittedly demanding with our dietary restrictions and general inability to arrive on time, but the staff here is more than accommodating and our waiter, Maxime, provided the hands down the best service I've had in Montreal over my last year of time working here. 

Atmosphere aside, we shared 9 dishes and 4 desserts and they were all fantastic. Get the tiramisu, it is absolutely amazing. 

I will be moving this restaurant to the top of my recommendation list starting tomorrow. 

Tip: parking is kind of a pain, but there is a lot nearby (not the one across the street, though!)
