ANHCo9X7zu0LdYecc9fk3Q For the most part reviewing airport restaurants is not usually something I consider doing however, I must say I truly enjoy this place! I am in love with the lemon tarts and I make sure to grab a couple every time I fly to PHX a. They have delicious hot sandwiches filled with ham and cheese and mmmm did I forget to mention..... Delicious! I rave to all my friends who travel to PHX about this little cafe and I've never heard of one bad review.
