XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q Having dined at l'Atelier de Joel Robuchon in Saint Germain, Paris, I was curious to see how Chef Robuchon's more traditional fine dining offerings in Las Vegas would compare - I was not disappointed.  The Sixteen course tasting menu with second tier wine pairings was quite good. The wait staff were far more reserved than at any other michelin three star restaurant I've ever been to, but they did a great job none the less - the sommelier, however, was a lot of fun and brought out a few additional wines to taste with each dessert course.  The dining room is beautiful and nearly matches the space at alan ducasse au plaza athenee in Paris for aesthetic value. Dinner at Joel Robuchon is the best fine dining experience Las Vegas has to offer.
