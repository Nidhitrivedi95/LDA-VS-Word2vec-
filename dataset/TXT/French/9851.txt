4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Had 8pm reservations on a Thursday evening, but it was for inside so we waited 45 minutes at the bar for a patio table.  Enjoyed our time there at the bar there was a lovely bar tender we chatted with.  Our table outside was in a croner really dark but we got to people watch and enjoy th Bellagio fountains so we were happy.  We started with a oyster potato soup and it was the bomb!!  We ordered the seafood platter, Maine lobster, shrimp, oysters for two and it was not very good.  It all tasted like it was frozen and lacked flavor really not good.  I guess we should have tried something else, we will go back but don't order that.  So I give this 4 stars for the restaurant  location etc, but the food was lacking so I have to downgrade to  3 stars.
