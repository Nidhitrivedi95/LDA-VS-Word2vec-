A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g LOVE this place!

Went here after class twice while I was attending CSN and the trips did not disappoint! I never got around to trying different things, I just come for the macaroons and that delicious chocolate chip twist thats the right mix of fluffy+crunchy (I think they also put this yellow filling inside that I can't quite put my finger on). I would make more trips out here if this place was closer to where I live (wahh I live in Henderson). Next time though I will definitely try the cakes and perhaps use someone's birthday as an excuse to buy a birthday cake and yeah more macaroons xD

Service was friendly when I visited. The lady who rung me up got the pastries promptly and didn't hesitate to help.
