rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Yet another must stop for my boyfriend and I due solely to the fact that he's a huge Thomas Keller fan.  We came for dinner and I started with one of their speciality drinks called The Bouchon.  It was tasty and well priced at $10.  We then ordered: 

- a mix of 3 cheeses.  All I can say is order the hook's cheddar!  It's amazing and after we had it we went to a cheese shop and bought 1/2 a pound to eat at home.   

- I had the roasted leg of lamb on a nicoise olive chickpea socca with peppers, arugula, and jus.  I ordered it medium and thought it came out a little overdone even though it was still slightly pink.  I loved my dish and would order it again if given the chance.

- My boyfriend had the roast chicken on a puff pastry round with ratatouille, garlic chips and jus.  He liked his dish at first, but there was a layer of pureed tomato that killed it for him.  It overpowered the whole thing making it almost inedible as time went on.     

Overall I would say service gets 5 stars, ambiance 4, and the food 4.  I would happily go back, but there are so many other better restaurants in Vegas that I probably never will.  Thanks anyway Bouchon.....
