The attention to detail is excellent. But it's one of those experiences, where you feel bad eating it because you have to ruin the presentation. The restaurant itself is cozy and unpretentious, and doubles as a market and deli (interesting oil selections).  As far as the taste, I wasn't too thrilled. Amuse-bouche was a nice touch, but it came as a cheese that was way too salty. Good thing there was a gallon of water on the table to quench my salted mouth. The seared tuna I ordered was ridiculously chewy, and I was definitely not amused.

Tips: Should have got the pre fixe, but it was out of my budget!
