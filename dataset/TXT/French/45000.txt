mT8Ej8sKFJoIa5G0Vl4AKA Great food and great service! Went for dinner one night during JazzFest two weeks ago.  My husband loved the steak with mushroom and blue cheese. I tried it and love it too.  I had the 2 lobster tails with mashed potatoes.  It was so good.  The best was the spinach dip, the drinks, and the service.  Our waiter, Alex was very attentive.  Had a great time.  We will definitely return the Baton Rouge when in Montreal next time. Would definitely recommend .
