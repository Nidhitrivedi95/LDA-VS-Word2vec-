O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q Amazing!!  Next time I am in Vegas I hope I can make it by to eat here . . . it was that good.  We had a lunch reservation, but it was not super crowded.  We took clients and were concerned with prices.  The service was attentive and the food was awesome.  I had the quiche and would get it again.  Enjoy!
