UxWH8zRYIBgs6Q2oykvRdw Came here for my friend's birthday dinner. This has become one of my favourite restaurants in Toronto. First of all, I didn't know that such a beautiful gem was hidden in distillery. I can't believe I haven't been here sooner. It's a french style restaurant with beautiful decor and food that makes you want to Instagram everything. There's an amazing bread station in the centre of the restaurant. We dared order rich and heavy foods because you only live once. Our top two favourites were HANDS DOWN the BRAISED BEEF & ROAST Mushroom poutine, and the wonderfully melted cheesy baked sauvagine for two (stuffed with mushroom and truffle paste). This is probably the best poutine I've had as far as I can remember. The flavours build and hit your taste buds like an explosion. Ahh. Craving it the moment I left. 

We also ordered the baked lobster bisque and the duck confit pie that came with a giant bone marrow in the centre. 

We probably wouldn't order the lobster bisque and the cotton candy dessert (milk chocolate pot de creme). The dessert didn't taste very good lol and the lobster bisque (though good) just wasn't on par with the other dishes. 

Service was quite slow but our server went out of her way to make our experience better.
