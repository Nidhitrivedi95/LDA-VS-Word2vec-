Kut9tVbDX_f7qKMRRoXg3w I think the 3.5 star rating for this place is pretty accurate. We only ordered the Alsace cassoulet and pastries, all of which were excellent. Service was friendly and attentive. The inside is very cute and the tables by the large windows are great for people watching. I would have given this place four stars, but there are two main reasons why I can only give it three: each cup of coffee is $3 - there are no refills. Really? No wonder this place was empty and the place across the street was packed! The prices are a little high, which definitely makes this place feel like a tourist trap. Our brunch for two with no alcohol was almost $80 with tip.
