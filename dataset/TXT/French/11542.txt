4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I went here for lunch today by myself and was seated at a corner of the patio under an umbrella for shade with a gorgeous view of the Bellagio and the fountains. My server was extremely nice and very friendly and helpful.

I ordered the Steak Frites with the Merlot butter and the red wine sauce. This had to be one of the most awesome steaks I've ever had. It was perfectly mid-rare, just how I ordered it, the quality of the beef was excellent and it just melted in my mouth. The red wine sauce was delicious and that merlot butter was mind blowing. 
The hand cut frites were deliciously crisp but not hard, very nicely seasoned and paired well with the steak. They also serve a warm freshly baked baguette on the side with some house churned butter which is really nice and oh so french. 

Overall I really enjoyed the meal. The gorgeous view makes it even better. I would very highly recommend coming here and would love to go back the next time I get a chance.
