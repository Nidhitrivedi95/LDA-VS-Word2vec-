SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ One word - yummy! It has been years since I have been to House of Tricks. A girlfriend and I had an impromptu happy hour date and met in Tempe without knowing where we would end up. Postino is always a great option but I live in Arcadia and wanted something different. House of Tricks it was! Great patio, great wine list, great service, and great snacks! We had the happy hour bruschetta and artichoke dip. Perfect snack with a glass of wine girl time! I will be back sooner than later.
