xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g I LOVE this place. My husband and I visit every month or so for an amazing evening on the strip. The foie gras is seared perfect and always a generous portion is served. Opt for the tasting menu with wine pairing. Also this is the BEST souffle I've ever had - share a chocolate and pistachio with your date for the perfect end to a perfect meal! Yum!
