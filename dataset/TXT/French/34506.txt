HOev_2CifUcfIm9xDL_uaw I had seen this very unassuming place before in the Scottsdale Airpark and had always been curious about it, so when a co-worker suggested we go here, I jumped on it.  I am in love with this place. It is owned by a couple who transplanted to AZ several years ago, and they opened this place in 2007. The paninis are absolutely magnifique, and the croissants are tender and delicate and baked fresh every morning. I was so impressed with them, that I suggested my work use them for a catering event a couple weeks later. They did a fantastic job...everyone who attended the event wanted to know where the food was from and where they could go to get it. 

I really hope to see this place succeed as it is pretty much run by the couple only (he cooks and she takes the orders and serves the food). Don't let the location detract you from visiting here!
