xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g My husband and I came here after we eloped back in November. I'm not sure if it was the high of just getting married (and the bottle of champagne we had before), but this place was PERFECT.
We tried to eat at the steakhouse at The Cosmopolitan, but it was PACKED and the music was so loud we couldn't hear each other talk. 
So we went over to Paris and we didn't have to wait long. The service was awful. Pretentious (though not shocking) and stuck up. We wanted to sit by the window, but they said it was reserved. There were four empty table by the window, none of which filled up the whole time we were dining.

Nonetheless, we didn't let it kill the mood. We ordered a delicious bottle of pinot noir (I forget which) and ordered the blue cheese souffle. It was AWESOME. So light, yet incredibly flavorful at the same time. 

Dinner: I had the NY Steak with cranberry/bone marrow sauce on top. Seriously the best steak I've ever eaten in my life. It may have been the best meal I've ever had in my life. It was juicy and flavorful, perfectly cooked. My husband had a filet mignon with foie gras w/truffle oil. He raved about his meal too (I thought mine was better though).

All in all, the service got a dismal tip (my husband wrote a note on the receipt) but the meal was amazing and memorable!
