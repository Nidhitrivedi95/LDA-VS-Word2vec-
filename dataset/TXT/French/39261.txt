jSfnItqaOnEp2nenVF7fCg We'd been enjoying semi-annual outdoor Sunday brunches here for years. My husband always got the eggs benedict with smoked salmon and for me the quiche lorraine. Plus we loved their beignets. A few years ago I began feeling increasing concern for the servers, getting the impression this is an especially difficult place to work.

This morning was our last time. Our table as well as several others were simply ignored for long periods of time. We saw people waiting 45 minutes for coffee. Plus, I'm socially sensitive and the west valley vibe of often very judgmental folks way too keen on being all into each other's business always was something that forced me to do spiritual work on myself the whole time.
