rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A We came here for brunch on a Saturday at 11 and surprisingly no line-up - score (or so we thought)!  

Ordered the corned beef hash and some waffles and then waited.... and waited.... and waited.... an hour passes and someone finally comes by to apologize that they lost our order and that they will bring us some pastries to try before we eat.  We wait another half hour before the pastries arrive, and an additional half hour before our meals get to us.  At this point neither of us are hungry anymore, nevertheless we eat.  Waffles were fine, nothing special.  Corned beef hash is is lacking any actual hash.  

We get the bill and nothing is comp'd. Had we not had to wait so long I probably would have given the place 3 stars but it was definitely not worth the 3 hours and $60 spent here!
