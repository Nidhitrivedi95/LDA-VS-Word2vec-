cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg Service is outstanding. The employees are so attentive and seem to really love their jobs. Food it also outstanding and some of the best I have had in Montreal. I will say the food is really heavy and I don't want to think about the fat and calories. You'll probably walk out having eaten 2000 calories and well over 50 grams of fat, per person. Then again, if you really care about that stuff, subways right around the corner. 

Treat yourself, check it out. You will not be disappointed.
