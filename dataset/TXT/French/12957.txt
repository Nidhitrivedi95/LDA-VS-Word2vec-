4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Grabbed a late breakfast here. Very short wait for the patio on a weekday, sitting outside was nice and relaxing. Had the scrumptious chicken, apple and brie crepes. Mmm!! 

It's pricey ($13 for the crepes), but it's a restaurant at a fancy hotel in Vegas, what do you expect. Maybe next time I'm out there I'll go back for dinner.
