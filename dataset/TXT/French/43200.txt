lQ9VmIWvM6v-rONPkYX8aQ Good god this place was amazing. The food, the ambiance, the wait service. Everything.

The little chef's samplers that they serve between meals is the best thing about Alex. Oh, and their pastry chef makes some AMAZING desserts. We were celebrating my birthday, so the pastry chef sent out some small cakes that were to die for.

The sommelier is a crazy awesome dude. Kind of weird though. He kept smelling the wine.
