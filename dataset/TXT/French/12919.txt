Request patio seating - you'll love watching the Bellagio Fountain performance while you dine.  

I had the trout, it was delicious. I wanted a light meal and this was perfect. It was a thin, tender and very moist - I particularly enjoyed the pan seared flavor and crusted buttery edges! 

My wife and I were celebrating our anniversary there and they made it extra special by surprising us with a complimentary dessert. 

Martin also made sure we were promptly served in order to make our show at Bellagio.
