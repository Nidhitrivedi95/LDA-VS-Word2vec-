4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Easily the best meal I've ever had in Vegas! Arrived here around 9pm on a Thursday night after finding many other restaurants in the area stopped seating at this time. We got a seat on the patio, which is directly across from the bellagio fountains so the view was great. The wait staff were top notch- friendly, funny, and very pleasant. I'm still dreaming about the steak with Merlot butter. It was exceptional! At $21, I didn't expect the quality to be great, but it was!
