rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A My favorite spot in Las Vegas. Like the rest of Thomas Keller's restaurants, this one is about as close to perfect as you can get from the moment you walk through the entrance. From the water to the butter to the napkins it is all completely thought out and lovely. I am a sucker for the steak frites, but this last visit I devoured a veal chop that was without peer.
