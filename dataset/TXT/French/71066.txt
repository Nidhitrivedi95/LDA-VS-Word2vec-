xcmmTXhuMx2fZF2Bt69F4w Point Brugge no longer represents solely a restaurant that has good food; it has become the place where I can sit back, relax and chow down on comfort food while leaving all my problems behind.

For me, everything is just right about Point Brugge.  The noise is always loud enough where I can be myself and won't bother other patrons.  The lighting is a comfortable glow where you can see everyone else around the table but aren't left in an awkward dim or the blinding light of fast food restaurants.  And oh the food.  I always have a large order of mussels to split, an order of macaroni gratin, and a bottle of Chimay Red.

Some people prefer the mussels with the white wine sauce, others prefer the red curry sauce.  I really have no preference; both are delicious and I love sopping up either sauce with their warm crusty bread.  The best part though is their macaroni gratin.  The cheesy blend of parmesan, gruyere and cheddar is ultra rich and I love cracking through the crunchiness of the top crust with my spoon revealing the gooeyness inside.  All of this is of course washed down with a bottle of Chimay Red.  They have other varieties, but I think Chimay Red pairs the best with the food at Point Brugge.

I never walk out of Point Brugge without a smile.
