KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA SO, actually,  it's honestly 3/5 stars for the restaurant on a normal day.  i actually visited because of groupon deal --unlimited mimosa for 2, charcuterie plate, 2 entrees for $69. for the groupon deal, it was 4/5 stars...good deal for sunday brunch.

venue: quite romantic. the entrance just seems like a tired strip mall but the restaurant area is on a lake, adorned with lights. it's not the most beautiful lake (lined with tired 90's build looking tract homes) but a lake is still a lake in a desert like Vegas. I visited in the summer but i bet it's quite pretty for dinner in the fall.

service: prompt, friendly

bottomless mimosas:5/5 *LOVE* how can you go wrong with bottomless mimosas for brunch? 

charcuterie plate:5/5 DELICIOUS. quite possibly the best charcuterie plate i've ever had. so many items on it and every single one of them were DELICIOUS. DEEELICIOUS. definitely coming back for this.

crab benedict:2/5: this kinda sucked. i mean the eggs were poached decently. but there was almost no crab. and it tasted like limp canned crab with no lovin. NOT impressed. and honestly, by the time i had the crab benedict, i was already 3 mimosas in and super happy with the charcuterie plate so i was in a generous mood. if i had ordered it sober, sans charcuterie, i probably would have sent it back.

truffle grits with steak: 3/5 truffled grits were fun. steak was meh. not a terrible disappointment, but not something i'd reorder

i doubt i'd return for a non-groupon brunch. however, i'd love to return for drinks and charcuterie or return for dinner in the fall. it's a very pretty venue, away from the glitz of the strip. i'd say overall a decent place for a date--romantic venue, food not memorable, but not so bad it'd ruin the date.
