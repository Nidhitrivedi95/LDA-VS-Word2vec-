Bf-yMQiSmDZyqfGyFKQ0bA I always forget about Blue Dust; maybe it's because the Waterfront is on the other side of town; maybe it's because there are so many other awesome places in Pittsburgh! Whatever it is, I'm glad we picked this card from the City Dining Card Deck today!

Blue Dust has a dive bar atmosphere with a classy and sophisticated menu-a true juxtaposition, which I enjoy. Sort of a surprise, especially to those who haven't been yet. 

We ordered from a diverse draft selection of several craft beers; their bottle selection is also very respectable, housing domestic and imported craft brews, some of which are normally a little more difficult to find. 

The appetizers we ordered were the China Doll Chana Daal dip (lentil mash) and pita bread, and nachos with beef brisket. Both were outstanding! I particularly enjoyed the lentil chana dip (it was covered in fresh onions and tomatoes-great mix)!

Around the table, entrees were ordered that included the pulled pork sandwich, falafel salad, fish tacos, cranberry and walnut salad, and teriyaki chicken wrap. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed their meals, but I will speak for myself when I say that the coleslaw recipe was weird, and not a good kind of weird. It needed more vinegar if that's the way they're going. Also, the chicken in the wrap was a bit overlooked and under sauced

Service was SO right-on. Server's name was Becky. What I loved most was that she knew the draft list and actually contradicted my very knowledgable husband! Loved it! Ha!

Good experience. We will return...again.
