VwZhwflLnTq19aAeFLJHCQ A "Frank Sinatra, Nat King Cole" vibe. Music of that era (which I enjoy because it reminds me very much of my dad). Sophisticated, yet a comfortable, casual feel. 

Great service! Everyone, including the manager - Roger, was on their A game!
Professional & attentive!

Now let's talk food..
Fiancé started off with the escargot .. Although I was not brave enough to try it he savored every single bite! 

Main dishes were Ribeye Steak Au Fromage Roquefort for me & Herb Crusted Lamb Chops for him. Both came with mashed potatoes and veggies.

My steak being cooked to a medium well/ALMOST well done is what stopped me from giving them 5 stars. 

STILL a good, tender piece of steak!

The lamb chops were very tender and not at all gamy! 

We ended the meal with Tiramisu and the popular Tarte Tartin.

Tiramisu was light and fluffy. The Tarte Tartin was well... tart.. But a great comparison to a good non crusted apple pie with ice cream!

Good ambience, good food, great service!
Definitely recommended if you're in the mood for French!
