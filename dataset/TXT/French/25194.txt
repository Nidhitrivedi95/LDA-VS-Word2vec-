Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA My first visit to this restaurant--overall was very good.  The  views are excellent, I thought the service was wonderful--Matt , the sommelier, was excellent.  Started with the Lobster salad--wonderful presentation, had just the right amount of seasonings.  This was followed with the scallops--they were prepared well, how ever, the mushrooms that accompanied them seemed to me to be too earthy for this light seafood.  Had the Foie Gras accompanied with a wonderful date and raisin compote--sweet and delicate.  Tried the charcuterie plate, was surprised with the simple yet tasty samples of prosciutto and rosemary cotto ham . Main course was the Lamb--excellent preparation and presentation.  Seasoned very well.  Finished every thing off with the chocolate souffle--very light and flavorful.  Overall had a wonderful time, atmosphere was very upscale and modern, as I said earlier, the views are great. Definitely a good place to visit.
