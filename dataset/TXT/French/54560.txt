rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw This was one the best places my wife and I ate at while in LV this past May. It was fantastic! Modern french with no fuss. Sommelier was helpful. Waiting staff was professional, helpful, and made us feel comfortable. The food was outstanding. I would highly recommend this to anyone staying in Las Vegas. This was a breath of fresh air amongst many dated and clearly tired restaurants on the strip!
