I chose this small restaurant for my birthday dinner, and couldn't be happier with how it turned out. Booking was a slice on opentable, and we received a voicemail to confirm the reservation.

Service from start to end was phenomenal, both from our server Lucy and (maybe) the co-owner? I can't recall her name, but she was super-enthusiastic about the cocktails she had recently concocted, and was a pleasure to talk to. Patient and exacting, the service from both of these ladies was remarkable.

Beer selection is limited to but well-served by Beau's: Lug Tread and the Festival Ale - the focus here is clearly on the wines. That said, my dining partner very much enjoyed her cocktail.

As others have expounded upon, the mains are available in two sizes: appetizer or main. We did four appetizer-size mains between the two of us, and were well-satiated. We greedily ordered the cheese plate during the halfway mark, which was completely unnecessary; didn't stop us though as the cheeses were awesome - we managed to find the room.

Same goat cheese tart and bread basket to start as others. For mains we ordered: merguez sausage, black cod, trio of lamb, and the braised beef. Honestly, each and every dish knocked it out of the park. I'd happily order any of them again. The server was more than accommodating in helping us make our selection, and was honest with her opinion; to wit: she warned us off sharing the appetizer-size scallops, as it would come with only one mollusk morsel.

We shared the souffle for dessert, which I think was the only portion of the evening that didn't blow it out for me. Sure it was light and fluffy, but it just reminded me of bread pudding and I thought the flavours were a bit flat - at least in comparison to the epic meal that preceded.

No problem though, there are other desserts to try.
