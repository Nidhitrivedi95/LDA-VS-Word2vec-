xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g Came to Vegas a month ago.  Came to Eiffel Tower Restaurant with one of my friends.  We were late but no one complained.  They were actually very understanding that our flight was delayed.  Welcomed and seated us right away.

Our lovely server was Maria W. who was very welcoming, nice and very attentive.

We ordered...
Seated scallops
Warm lobster salad
Foie grad
Asparagus soup (2)
Amuse Bouche (2)
Sparkling Rose (4)

From the drinks, to the food, to the great view and amazing service, everything was perfect!!!

It was lovely meeting Sharon (manager) who was super nice and professional.  Good to meet the person that runs such a great establishment!

We had a great experience and are looking forward to next time.
