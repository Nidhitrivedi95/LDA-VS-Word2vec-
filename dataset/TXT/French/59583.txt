s11Ym0QX2Am2uwtnyou4GA 4.5 stars We had an excellent meal here and based on the reviews, I believe that the only poor reviews happen when the diners don't like the food type they ordered. This would be a five star rating if the appetizers were not in counts of 3... this is annoying when you have 2 people. I know that's minor, but it is a negative issue. Would it kill the budget to add one more piece?

We enjoyed the chacuterie small plate, though it was actually just pate and figs on a piece of bruscetta. We also had the chorizo corn dogs that were tasty and not doughy-heavy with a nice spicy kick to the sausage.

For mains, my husband had the rabbit and loved it, though he felt the portion was a bit light.. I had the filet, ordered medium rare. When it came out raw, it was immediately pleasantly returned to the kitchen, where they not only prepared it perfectly but replated my entire meal with all the sides fresh and hot. EXCELLENT SERVICE!

Service was quick and friendly and the chef came out to apologize about the steak. This is a great place for dinner, warm and welcoming and wee recommend it!
