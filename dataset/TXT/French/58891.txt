rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w Amazing restaurant. Went here a few years ago and they greeted me like a regular! I read another review that said the portions are small, I would have to disagree and say they are perfect! We asked for wine pairing with our meal and the choices given to us were also brilliant. To top it all off they gave us a complimentary dessert wine and a small box of chocolates. We were treated like VIP's from start to finish. Definitely the place to go if you want a special evening. Ps the venison is amazing!
