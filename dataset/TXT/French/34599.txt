Now to the food. 

In general, for this caliber of restaurant, it should have been a 100 times better. I found all the appetizers to be flavorless. When you have appetizers sit on the table for extended periods with several people eating, something is not working right. The halibut was also bland. The ONLY thing worth getting is the buffalo steak. That was amazing.

And they had a well chosen beer list.
