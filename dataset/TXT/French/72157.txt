XKPosZx2j4RHcZ8Ewdwj0A Came here for the after 10pm menu! So totally worth it ! The restaurant atmosphere was really nice, service was awesome (waiters were all so good looking :O), and the food was amazing! 

We ordered the crab cake and the rillette. Crab cake was nice but I liked the salad on the side even more!. My friend liked the rillette, I've never had it before but I think it's pretty good.

For the entree we ordered the duck leg confit and the roasted beef short rib with barley. The duck leg was cooked perfectly, the skin was so delicious crispy and fat . Roast rib was also really nice, falls apart easily and tasty. 

Will definitely come back. Good place for a date!
