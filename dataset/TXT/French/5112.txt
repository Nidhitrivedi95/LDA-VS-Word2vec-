37kk0IW6jL7ZlxZF6k2QBg Rarely does a restaurant transcend banality, leap beyond trend and showmanship, and take a diner on a journey to an unexplored culinary experience.  Edulis did this, providing fun, laughter and comfort along the way.   My dinner will be added to my most memorable restaurant experiences.  Edulis is one of the best restaurants in the world, deserving of multiple Michelin stars.

Consisting of two, low ceiling, candlelit rooms, Edulis discards hip for warmth.  Our server, Dana, was charming and knowledgable, helping us navigate through the meal with pleasure.  We added a gorgeous $80 bottle of Alsatian Sylvaner to our meal and settled back for the five course prix fix dinner. A seven course experience is also offered, but we wanted to add the 60 dollar supplement for the white truffle risotto dish, and that was plenty "over the top." Edulis is expensive, but you get what you pay for.

I couldn't recount every dish if I wanted to, and besides, Edulis changes the menu nightly. Let it suffice to say that every morsel was amazing, and I exclaimed with pleasure in a Rabelaisian display of gluttony.  The last meal that transformed my being was in Marseille at the Michelin starred AM Alexandre Mazzia, and Edulis equaled that indulgence of a "died and gone to heaven" dining moment.  This was the highlight of my trip to Toronto and Edulis makes this Canadian metropolis a culinary destination for any "foodie." Bravo!
