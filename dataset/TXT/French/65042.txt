Tl2nqtPXlLbAG3qkUYVM2g I was excited to try this restaurant out, especially after snagging a Groupon.  The restaurant is in a small mixed use building, which makes the parking situation very difficult.  However, after you get passed the chaotic parking, you will enter the restaurant quaint restaurant feeling like you have left the concrete jungle behind.  

The inside is kind of dated, but fitting for a french restaurant.  The tables and chairs are very old and provide a nice setting to have a meal.

Right off the bat, however, the service was lousy.  And this by itself is why this place gets 3 stars.  I think it took a good 10 minutes for someone to come by and take our order.  The waiters are basically career waiters, they have been their forever and unfortunately are not very friendly.  I would much rather be served by a younger person in their 20's who can provide a not so snoody feeling for the dinner.  I have eaten at other french restaurants of higher caliber and the service is much better.

The food was very good though.  I had the rack of lamb.  A great choice and cooked exactly to my liking.  The desserts looked great, but nothing really jumped out at me as being have to have.  But even though we decided not to order the waiter brought out a selection of 3  mini creme brulees.  I guess that is common.  So for future reference I will not order the dessert and just bank on the free one.

Overall, I wont return unless I have a groupon.  I feel there are better restaurants, and cheaper ones too.
