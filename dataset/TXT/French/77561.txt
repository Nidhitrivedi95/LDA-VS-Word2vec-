YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g I only came here for dessert -- the Grand Marnier souffle was the choice for me.  It was light and airy.  I enjoyed every single little bite.  Paired with a lovely coffee drink, and this was the perfect way to start a work conference. 

If the dessert was any indication of the rest of the restaurant, it's worth going back.
