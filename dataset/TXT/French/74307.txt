xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g The ONLY good thing about this place: the incredibly gorgeous 180 view you have of the Strip. We were able to watch the Bellagio fountain show from our table. Food & service was measly. For one, the menu is not very French. French toast was on the menu. That turned me off. Really? French toast is NOT French. And the drinks? My friend paid $18 for a supposed drink that was the hot seller. It was a strange fizzy pink liquid with raspberries floating in it. Did not taste good. Gross.

Our server was very quick to leave us. Don't get me wrong, he definitely had a host's personality when he spoke with us... for like 5 seconds! He would dart in and out, just before we finally would form a question in our minds about the food on the menu.

I had the Aged Parmesan Chicken with what looked like canned vegetables & a miserable pile of dry-tasting potatoes gratin. Blah. The only reason the chicken was tasty was because there was AGED parmesan. And it looked like a giant flat pancake on my plate. I paid $24 for something I could make myself.

I hear there's an Eiffel Tower Las Vegas tour. Go on that instead so you can at least check out the view. The food is not worth it.
