The decor is gorgeously modern with lots of white, which contrasts with the dark elements of the decor and is complimented by the shiny silver pendant lights. Lots of spacious seating: open, airy and bright with plenty of beautiful backdrops for selfies.

One thing that I love about the food displays is that they're very enticing; I like food that's visually appealing as well as tasty. Most of the food is labeled and includes the ingredient list. You start at the far right of the counter and choose your main (flat breads with various toppings on top shelf, sandwiches in the middle and salads on the bottom); the flat breads and sandwiches come with a small side salad or soup of the day. You move to your left and peruse the artful dessert section. When you reach the cashier, tell them which desserts, drinks and/or gelato you want to add then pay and take your number to a table of your choice (self serve water at the end of the long counter past the first gelato case). Take your number to your table and they will deliver the food to you. High top tables here are made for tall people; when my friend and I (5'2") sat at one, the table was at our chest level.

My girlfriend and I ordered:

- Grilled Veggie sandwich (roasted eggplant, arugula, zucchini, confit tomato, red pepper and basil pesto) with the side salad. I'm a hardcore carnivore but I did enjoy the flavors of this sandwich and the delicious crusty bread that they used.
-Coppa flat bread(coppa meat, artichoke, mushrooms, fig & feta cheese) with the sweet potato soup side. The flat bread was tasty and the toppings were savory and delicious. The soup was nice and thick with a natural sweetness to it.
- Latte with hazelnut syrup served with a cute, little flower cookie. Pretty decent, no need to add sugar.
- Cake that had pistachios, ashta (clotted cream with rose water and orange blossom water) covered in a raspberry glaze with white chocolate around the base. This dessert looked beautiful, was aromatic and had a nice balance between the sweet and tart flavors.

Service is quick and friendly but if you are a noob and start asking a lot of questions, like me, they're not as warm. Service stops when they drop off your food but when you're done, just leave your dishes on the table and they'll take care of it. 

Thanks to Dennie I for the awesome tip about coming during peak hours to ensure you get food that's freshly made and not sitting around all day. I would also recommend coming when they first open as well.

My friend and I had an amazing girly lunch here. I will surely bring my other girlfriends to come and enjoy their flavorful,  beautifully crafted Lebanese/French/Mediterranean food.
