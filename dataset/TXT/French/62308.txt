SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ I met here with friends yesterday for lunch.  The food was as delicious as usual, however the construction noise from right across the street where new apartments are being built, ruined the atmosphere and severely limited parking options.

I guess a better idea would be to meet here for dinner after the construction people finish for the day.

Does Tempe really need more apartments?  This looks like a HUGE project.
