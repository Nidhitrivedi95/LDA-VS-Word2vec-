cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg This place is insanely delicious.  The restaurant is a bit tight on space but the kitchen is opened. You can actually hear the staff call out orders.  

There are so many options that we probably over ordered for two people!! For starters, we had poutine with foie gras, duck carpaccio and beef tongue.  For entrees we had the duck in a can and the blood sausage tart.  The duck in the can was amazing! We totally over did it on the foie gras but you only live once! We had so much food


We had to call ahead so the restaurant could accommodate our baby.
