3FlWR_osNPb8dcqLgHebHw It's been a while since I was here and didn't realize the whole menu had been changed... Unfortunately, some of my favorite things were taken off & I wasn't crazy about the new options which is why I gave it 3 stars... The service was great for a busy brunch morning and the food was okay but not great... It has a more French flair which I think is difficult to do when it's not high end but for the price it was pretty good... I'm not sure if I'll go again for brunch but might check it out for lunch/dinner
