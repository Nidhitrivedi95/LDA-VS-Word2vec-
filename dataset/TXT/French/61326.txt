I felt guilty for going back to my one true love, their granola, every time I ate here. It's served with yogurt, milk, and fresh fruit. My sick addiction to this menu option finally changed when I ventured to try their grilled cheese on this amazing bread with sun dried cherry, golden raisin, and pear compote and cave aged cheese.

Their staff is all very attentive and have great attitudes. The whole experience feels wholesome.
