KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA Since I had eaten here a day before Valentine's Day, I can understand that this place was extremely busy. So I won't say too much about the long wait time for seating and dining. 

However, I have been a hostess before. So normally when a guest checks into a restaurant and that if you ask them to wait in the waiting area, you should write a small description what each group looks like next to their name. Here, the hostess would literally ask all the group in the waiting area if their last name was so and so. Of course I over heard this one guest said "No, I am not them but I've been here for 20 minutes and not sat down yet"....,,,that could of been easily avoided! Me and my boyfriend had reservation at 8 but didn't get sat until 20 minutes later, so I guess a reservation here doesn't mean too much for them. Also the bartender was the first person you see when you walk in and she takes down your name too. She was seriously emotionless and only said ok. No greetings, welcome, or a smile. Well maybe you shouldn't be the first person diners should see when they enter. 

I am giving this place a 4 star because of the whole dining atmosphere. It is different and probably something you won't find anywhere else in vegas. There's nothing better than drinking a glass of wine next to a beautiful lake. Such a romantic feel and location. They also have a long list of wines as well as wine bottle selection that can be purchased in the waiting area and can be brought to your table to enjoy. 

As for the food, their steak Tar tar and duck breast salad were on point. Flavorful, clean, and just the right amount to share. But I am sad to say I didn't enjoy my main dish, braised short rib ravioli. It was creamy and thick, with no flavor. My boyfriend enjoyed his salmon plate though!

As for the service, they were nice but not as friendly as other places I've been too.
