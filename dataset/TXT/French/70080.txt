wV5IYyqc35F1g3fSZjt41A I came to this restaurant as everywhere else was packed and I was not about to wait an hour and half for supper at 8:30 at night. So came to Portivino with my colleague. Place was full but we only waited 10 min to be seated.

The service was fast our server was very courteous and explained the choices and menu. We were always tended to: water refill,  bread. We each started off with a salad, which was solid, and then our main meal came. I had the chicken fillet with white wine sauce, variety off vegetable and served on french fries. My colleague had the osso bucco which was served on a bed of risotto. Presentation wise is was beautiful and looked really appetizing. 

Unfortunately in my case flavours fell short. Chicken was too dry, not enough seasoning very very bland, also the french fries were soggy as it had absorbed all the sauce and juices of the chicken. Was not tasty at all. But my colleague osso buco was really tasty and that's why I'm giving it a 3 star. The ambiance is nice but much too noisy we could barely here each other speak. We ordered cappuccino at the end, I like my coffee hot but this was lukewarm. NOT IMPRESSED
