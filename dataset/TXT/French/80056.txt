ZV7t55UEx1LnBOWqTrutSw We recently attended the company Holiday dinner at EVOO. The restaurant is small so they closed it for us and treated us like family. The food... a three course menu with choices for each course had some thing for everyone.  All very tasty but I have to admit my favorite course was the two hour cocktail and superb appetizers ..salmon mouse, pate, crudités all sourced locally and the cocktails were fantastic!
