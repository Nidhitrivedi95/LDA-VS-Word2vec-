My friends and I went to Delux on Saturday with the intention of having lunch, but were slightly disappointed to find out they only had brunch on Sundays.  I guess we should have paid a bit more attention to their website, but I figured brunch was a universal weekend thing.

Nonetheless, we stayed for lunch and had a great time.  The decor is comfy and relaxed and the staff are knowledgeable and kind.  I ordered the chicken sandwich with a side of conch fritters.  When I visited the Bahamas, I remember having the best conch fritters, so I was excited to see this on the menu.  These fritters lacked the seafood taste I was looking for, and was on the bland side.  The chicken sandwich, on the other hand was amazing.  The bread was nice and soft and the tomato and avocado gave it a great fresh flavour.  The chicken was also well seasoned and moist.  I always worry that chicken will be dried out, so I always order it with a bit of apprehension, but I was pleasantly surprised.  

Overall it's a great spot.  I hear they do a great dinner as well, so I'm sure I'll be back.
