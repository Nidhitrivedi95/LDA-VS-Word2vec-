USleI8g1UVN9-9jm-b4uIg First time diners at Fig Tree. We arrived early for our reservation on a Saturday evening and they had our table ready in a dining room off the front main room. Low light, quiet atmosphere - perfect for a date night.

I had the veal chop with the smashed fingerling potatoes, cremini mushrooms and sherry garlic butter sauce. Delicious! My dining companion had the filet with polenta cake and spinach. They cooked it perfectly (medium well) on first try! We weren't used to that - even at some steakhouses they undercook the request and it must be sent back, but not here. 

The dinner lived up to the reputation, and we will definitely return. Our waiter and the staff were all professional and attentive. A wonderful dining experience. 

The only disappointing aspect had nothing to do with the restaurant but with the dress of some of the other diners - I do not think cargo shorts and flipflops are appropriate attire for this type of restaurant.
