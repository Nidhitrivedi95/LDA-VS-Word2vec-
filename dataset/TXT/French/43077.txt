LQ_gYNs5E10IGFE0NOyD7A The Upton has a very nice ambiance, especially the patio.  I highly recommend the fried chicken with honey.  I literally had dreams about this meal.  The duck wing appetizer was tender and moist but lacked seasoning.  However, the ranch dressing more than made up for it.

I would recommend the Upton to anyone local or visiting Scottsdale.
