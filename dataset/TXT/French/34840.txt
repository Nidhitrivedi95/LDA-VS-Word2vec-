HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw Your typical so-so, on the strip, overly priced restaurant. 

We ate here for lunch for my mom's birthday. Most of our party ordered off the "Quick Lunch" - which included an appetizer, entree, and dessert. I had the comme ca burger based on the yelp reviews & pictures.

The portions on the quick lunch was surprisingly large. I could have easily split that meal with my sister, which I did. She ordered the salad as an appetizer, French dip au jus for her entree, and creme brûlée for dessert. All of these tasted pretty average to me. I had one small bite of my burger (took the rest home) and again the taste was nothing that knocked my socks off. 

The view is probably the only thing this restaurant has going for. We came during daytime, so I'm sure it's even lovelier at night with all the lights on. 

Wait staff was average, but I was expecting a bit more service given the nature of this place. The restaurant wasn't busy this afternoon, but I felt they still moved at a slow pace. 

Overall I'm glad we tried this place, but there was nothing memorable about the visit that makes me want to come back.
