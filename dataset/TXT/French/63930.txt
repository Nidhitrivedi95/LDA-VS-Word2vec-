T4shscbr3BU3yb6EA3BSfA This is probably my favorite restaurant in Montreal! The decor is cool, the staff is not pretentious and super helful...and the desserts, especially the lichy, are amazing!!!!I
The menu changes all the time but you won't be disappointed!
If you are in Montreal, you should not miss it!!!
