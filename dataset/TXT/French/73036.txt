XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q O man, where do I begin this experience? I called about a week ahead and it was really easy to get a table for a party of 4. They picked us up at our hotel with a limo and took us to the private entrance of the MGM mansion, which I guess only invited guests are allowed? Took a quick tour of the place and went to the restaurant. 

After we ordered our food, they brought out the bread cart and it was AMAZING! At least 10 selections of awesome breads with butter hand churned from England or something. Just amazing. 

Our dishes themselves were unbelievable, everything was just soo delicious. And we didn't need to order dessert at all, their dessert cart was amazing as well. Overall, we were full on a 3-4 course meal!
