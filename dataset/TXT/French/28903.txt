el-3IdlW3bTCSnquLvH-3w How cute is this bistro! I absolutely love this place! Went to La Petite France with some girlfriends who wanted to celebrate my 40th birthday, and was very thrilled this was the place that was picked, have been wanting to try them for a while now!

When we got their we were greeted with a friendly warm welcomed and showed to our table. The place inside is just so cute! I love the Paris Clock next the coffee maker.

I ordered the La Jardiniere (spinach & mushroom quiches) and was exactly how I expected it to be. Light, fluffy, and very very tastly! The dough was amazing, come to find out, they make their own dough by hand and everything is cooked in a brick oven. My friends ordered the Vegetarienne Tarte Flambees, which was loaded with crème fresh, fresh tasting veggies and cheese, and that too was amazing. The food was c'est magnifique! Also had a Carmel Café, which was devine! Loved it!

Can't wait to come back and try other items on the menu! One for sure is the crème brulee!! It's one of my favorite desserts!
