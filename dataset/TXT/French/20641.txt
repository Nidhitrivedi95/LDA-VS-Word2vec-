AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw Based upon rave reviews on Yelp, and being a huge fan of most French pasteries and desserts, we made a special trip to Payard Patisserie to try their macarons.  Sadly though - everything we tried there was a HUGE disappointment.   Maybe it had something to do with the fact that we had just come from Bouchon (located in the Venetian), but everything we got here was way below our expectations.  The macarons come in a $12 pre-packaged bag (6 assorted bite-sized macarons) and were all stale and flavorless.  None of them had a chewy texture that a proper macaron should have.  

We also ordered a couple of their dessert crepes - which all range from $12 to $15 each.  They were all mediocre and drenched in the same chocolate sauce.  The decor inside the bakery is adorable though, and their chocolate displays are amazing.  It's too bad everything looked better than it tasted.

With so many other options in Vegas, I'd definitely recommend avoiding this one and giving others a try.
