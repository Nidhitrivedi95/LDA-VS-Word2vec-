rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Very nice, if you can actually find it (the casino signage and touchscreens are wrong - go to the theatre and then up the elevators to the 10th floor). Our wait for an inside table at 9 am on Saturday was only 5 minutes. A little longer for outside - the view was tempting, but not worth it in the June heat! The decor is lovely and our waiter was attentive, but a little snobby (I asked for bread plates and was told "these aren't typical for a traditional French bistro". That's nice, but we're not in France, just bring me a bread plate)
On to food: the smoked salmon was excellent, served with super-fresh herbed cream cheese, capers, onions, and tomatoes. The saffron mussels were cooked to perfection and served piping hot - the first couple burned my fingers. My bellini was on point. Everything arrived at the table together and quickly.
Overall, a very satisfying breakfast. If you don't mind putting in a little extra effort and money over the typical breakfast joint, and are in search of true dining, Bouchon is for you.
