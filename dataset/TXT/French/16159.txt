7DPMQ5vXzRtTlSy-aZrQNQ Love this place!!! Great food, great decor, excellent service and very good location. You go there, and it's not like those other restaurants/coffee places. Even if "Brioche dorée" is a chain, the owners designed the whole place. They did it with taste and a lot of chic! And speaking of taste: the food!!! Extremely tasty. And the variety! You could literally go a few times a week and never have the same thing. Today I tried this new wrap, it's like a sushi wrap...wow! Owners and staff are great and make you feel like family. Just go, you'll love it.
