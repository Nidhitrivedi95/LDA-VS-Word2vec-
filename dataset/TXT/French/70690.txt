Purchased: Big Boy (savoury) and the Mouthful (sweet)

It was a weekday in the mid afternoon. It's a cozy place. There's enough seating for about 20 people. The owners are extremely nice and welcoming. Nutella bottles are everywhere!

While looking at the menu and trying to make up my mind, I was offered a sample of the sugar cane juice. It was amazingly fresh and refreshing. I've only tried it in a can before and I didn't like it so much then. This is something I would order the next time I'm there. 

Finally, I decided on my choices. They let me know that you can customize any of the crepes to your liking such as adding or subtracting ingredients  and even cooking the crepe lighter or darker. I was able to watch them prepare everything and cook the crepe. They prepared my savoury first and as I finished they started to prepare my sweet crepe. It was placed in a cardboard cut out and placed in a metal stand. They explain in detail how to properly eat the crepe. 

I was super excited as I took my first bite. It was a well balanced and extremely tasty crepe. Then, I got my sweet crepe and I devoured it. 

I will definitely be back to try the other combinations of crepe!
