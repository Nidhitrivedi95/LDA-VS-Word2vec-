mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q FINE DINING at it's best. 

The restaurant is located inside MGM but not part of the casino. We went there yesterday with my Fiance and LOVED IT. The restaurant is pricey but well worth the money as you go for the experience. We ordered the $78 per person menu item and got 5 different things. The portions were small BUT since it takes a while for the items to come, you will get full. I'm a type of guy that loves going to restaurants where the portions are big so I was not too sure about this place but surprisingly I got full. First they brought the bread. IT WAS YUMMY with the best butter that I have ever tasted. The main course / soup / desert were ALL GREAT. If you go to this place expect to pay around $220 - $250 minimum for two people. The servers were friendly and very professional. 

PS - you might want to dress up for this place. I will go there again.
