xNnZ5ksBY1gwwTV2Btb4Ag My favourite stop on my first trip to Montreal for F1 weekend. (Included au pied de cochon, l'express, lemeac)

Between 3 of us, we split 12 oysters, horse carpaccio, popcorn sweetbreads, asparagus salad, rabbit taco's & then finished with 12 more fresh oysters.
For dessert , I tapped out but the other 2 had the mousse and chocolate tart.

Service was fantastic, great mix of explaining what we needed to know, not bothering us too much and bringing out food as soon as our prior dishes were finished. Oysters were so fresh, horse carpaccio flavourful & sweetbreads crispy and light. Rabbit cooked to perfection, and just melt in your mouth wonderful.

The space is cozy, but definitely roomier than a place like au pied. But honestly just 0 complaints. Just want to reiterate how good the service was, their recommendations were spot on and helping us translate the chalkboard was definitely appreciated! Nothing stuck up or stuffy about this place at all, just come in and enjoy this great food.
