jLxeBgWhLRbII2ACkgH1Sg This is a true find! I found this restaurant by accident. I had a ham panini which was the greatest panini I've had in a long time. It was done to perfection with a small salad. I also sampled a crepe with ham, swiss cheese and topped with an egg. That's not all. Cafe is only a part of this place. The word Bakery really takes hold when you see perfect croissants, beautiful crusty French bread. Wait until you see the French pastries. I came home with almond croissants, and a great creme brûlée. La Belle is 30 miles from my house but i WILL be a regular customer.
