aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw Just went there for tiny breakfast and quite disappointed with the pain au chocolat. Coming from France first yet living in SF, we are used to do much better. Having a French name for a bakery, they should have reached the higher standard off tench pastries. It was a miss. And please people working there. You are maybe entitled to work on a 31 at of December, but a smile at breakfast is a minimum for clients. On the service side you are certainly. Very close to the French lol
