SBnpT6JDbah-5l_52GM5sw I've been to Sardine twice for dinner and it was outstanding both times. The ambience is upscale casual and slightly noisy. It wouldn't be the best choice for a romantic evening. The food is incredible and the crab cakes were the best I've ever had. I highly recommend this restaurant!
