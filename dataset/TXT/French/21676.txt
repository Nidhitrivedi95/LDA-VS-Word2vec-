Bf-yMQiSmDZyqfGyFKQ0bA Met a friend for lunch that, like me, had not been to BD in quit a long time.  
If you are into beers, this is a great spot.
Like some of the brownish mural type painting on the wall along with the big old bar.  
Our server was the bartender who was handling the entire place, was very nice and efficient.  Did forget my soup, until reminded.  The Curry Crab soup was very good with a lot of curry and crab flavor.  The Eric Poster Tacos of pulled pork on corn shells (two tacos) were large and topped with fresh salsa and scallions.  The meat had a nice smoke flavor and was very juicy...sloppy to eat.  
Nice place for a cold one and a good meal.
