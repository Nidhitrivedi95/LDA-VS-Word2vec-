We stopped by earlier to confirm that we wanted to spend our anniversary evening at Bardot and upon inquiring about a particular dish that we love there from past experiences, we discovered that it was served only for brunches, not dinners.   We thought that was that.  But the front hostess actually called out a server to discuss the item with us to confirm that we were speaking about the same item.  We made the reservation.

Upon arrival in the evening, we were promptly seated.   We were properly greeted and taken care of.  I ordered a rib eye steak but it came out overcooked a bit.  But at the luxary price that I paid for it, I returned it to the kitchen and asked for the lamb chops.   The manager, Mr. Anthony Carideo - general manager - came to my table and in one of the most excellent exhibitions of proper customer care, was nice, communicative, not overly drippingly fake, and admitted fault - immediately - "it was overcooked - I looked at it and it was cooked medium well" (I ordered medium).   We chatted a bit about life, and he appropriately moved on.  The chops arrived and as the rest of the food, including my wife's and our other dishes, and drinks, they were excellent - fantastic.

But wait.  The best was last.  At the conclusion of the meal, they brought to us THE SPECIAL DISH that we wanted so much that is not normally made for dinners.  It is a like a fruit/yogurty type of a tray.  We were happily surprised.  We also had our photos professionally taken there and bought the photo.

Thanks Bardot - you were the BEST part of our Vegas trip.
