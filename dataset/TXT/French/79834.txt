Friendly and helpful service made us feel right at home.  Everything off the eclectic menu is made to order, and it shows. Each of our 3 dishes were fresh and perfectly prepared. Prices are very reasonable, and the atmosphere is great for everything from an intimate date to dinner with family. Highly recommend!
