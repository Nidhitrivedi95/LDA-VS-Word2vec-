q0n4I-zqiI47xispOqc1lA My review is based on the overall experience of the place. My friend and I went on a Sunday a little after noon. It was not very crowded inside, but the patio was full. We ended up sitting at a high top table, which was fine. It took them awhile to tell us whether or not they had outside seating available. So that was weird. 

I ordered the potato Mona styles eggs. The eggs came with a small piece of toasted bread and a tiny salad. The salad dressing was delicious (balsamic) and the lettuce and tomatoes were incredibly fresh. I would have been ok sacrificing some eggs for more salad. The eggs were also really interesting and tasty. There was a little bit too much cheese on the eggs but I still thought it was yummy. I loved the bread and wish it had been larger!

The experience was overall not pleasant, though. They seemed short staffed. The guy at the front seemed incredibly stressed and frazzled. I think there was a family there that really frazzled the staff. They kept going behind the counter and preparing their own drinks! It was really weird. So I understand that the annoying family was not the staff's fault, but their annoyance was translating onto other customers like us. The guy was clearly not handling it well and it showed. Again, this was really not their fault because that family was so obnoxious!

I would maybe go again if I had a patio seat. I feel like all that frenzied activity would have been shielded from us had we been outside. So, while the food was excellent, the service was very uncomfortable.

I would say it was just a bad day! So that's why I'll still give four stars. I docked a star for the staff experience.
