klzCMxmhrHWZeNseS4GKFg Cafe Marlayne is one of the best French restaurants I have ever been to in my LIFE. This is the original Thistle St branch and there is another equally fantastic branch just off the Royal Mile on Old Fishmarket Close which is slightly less intimate but fantastic nevertheless. Why am I so crazy for Cafe M? For a start the prices are really reasonable, particularly at lunch when nothing costs more than a tenner and you can eat three courses for about £20 per head. Not bad for somewhere which uses such quality ingredients to create simple, delicious French delights. Then there's the atmosphere- This place is so small that it is always booked up so there is a vibrant buzz to the place, and although the tables are quite close together you never feel like anyone is intruding on your personal space/conversations/flirtations/salacious gossiping about enemies. The service is always fantastic, great wines, I've never had anything to eat here that I haven't wanted another plate of- I'm kind of wishing I could keep it to myself but as I say you DEFINITELY need to book in advance for this one so I guess I'm a bit late if I wanted to have Cafe M as my little secret. Go here. You won't regret it.
