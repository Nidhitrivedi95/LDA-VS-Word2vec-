AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw Oh Payard, How I Love Thee...

Payard Patisserie and Bistro is located inside Caesar  Palace.  It is located near the Caesar Palace's Buffet.  I remember when it first opened in 2007, I was very impressed by the interior & exterior decor, and of course the chocolate and pastries .  When you pass by the store, the decor, pastries, and chocolates just draws your eyes towards the store.  I'm always mesmerized by it's glam and style.  

The hot coco is delish!  The chocolate is one of the best chocolates I have ever ate.  I'm currently eating it right now.  I got a box as a gift when I went to Vegas for Christmas week.  Every bite of the chocolate just makes you say "MmmMmm...... "  I close my eye every time I eat the chocolate because it's that good!  It is a little pricey but it's worth it! 

Payard chocolate is a perfect gift for anybody, especially a girl.  This chocolate is definitely a key to a girl's heart.
