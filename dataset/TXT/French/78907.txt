ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug I was nervous to come here because of the bad reviews on service. 

There were 9 of us that went last night. We wanted a nice dinner before going to see the Jersey Boys and Mon Ami Gabi was a little too expensive for everyone's taste. 

We made a reservation and they sat us immediately. The drinks came fast and the waiter was very attentive. 

Everything we had was very good. Steaks, chicken, beef tenderloin, salads, etc. Everyone enjoyed the food very much. 


I didn't have a lot to say. I just wanted to give them a good review because we didn't have any of the experience others have had. 

Props to our waiter - he was excellent with an awesome sense of humor.
