aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw Almost hidden, this place is well worth the search. The macarons are very good (the pistachio and chocolate were exquisitely made and the quality of the ingredients shined in every bite). They are expensive ($4+ each) but they are of the 'large' variety and any sane person would be completely satiated with just one (i of course had to have 3...). 

The only thing I had here that i didn't completely enjoy was the 'nutter butter' sandwich cookie..i will not blame Bouchon Bakery for this however as I had no business ordering this type of American style/flavor treat here. If i truly wanted a nutter butter i should have gone to 7-11 convenience store. 

Highly recommend. Another tip: there is NO better dinner party, housewarming, or 'i was thinking of you' gift than a box of macarons (*hint* to any of my friends that may be reading this).
