bEVWHtBRYVwqaaNF4mWNYg Came here for lunch with a friend on a Wednesday and the place filled up quickly, the tables are situated close together and the place gets very noisy. The waiters were very welcoming, as well as quick and attentive. I had their mushroom ravioli and it was freaking delicious. The cream sauce was so amazing that I was eating the bread with it!
