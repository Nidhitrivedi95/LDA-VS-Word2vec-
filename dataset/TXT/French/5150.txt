3FlWR_osNPb8dcqLgHebHw I came here on Monday, and I really enjoyed the food and service I received!
The host, and the waitresses were very friendly, attentive, and exceeded my expectations that I had for Mimi's prior to arriving.

Make sure to ask for bread if they don't ask you already, because the madelines are amazing! They were delicious and fresh out of the oven, I ate all of them and asked for a second serving, which was brought out to me within a few seconds! That, I was impressed with.

I ordered chicken and waffles, and it came out to me in under 5 minutes. The chicken was breaded, and crisp, and the waffle was nice and fluffy.

I will definitely visit again!
