mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q I like the easy atmosphere and amazed by the high efficiently operating kitchen with about 20 men working and waking around inside. Food was great! We were not hungary and chose the small bites. Welcome gifts and thank you gifts are carefully designed to be warm and delicious, waking up my appetite and keeping my stomach comfort. My husband wants to comment specially for the yellowtail dish: very strong taste but so close to his joyful upper limit. If the seasoning was stronger in any direction it will be a pain. So it's a pretty good mouth massage! The one star deduction is from the desert. Maybe such a small kitchen cannot afford a dedicate bakery chef, so the manager wants to use desert quantity to cover the low quality. We ordered traditional tarts and it came up with 5 small pieces, not fresh enough, all dry and tasted unbalanced. Will come back again without ordering desert.
