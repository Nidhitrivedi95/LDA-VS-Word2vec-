bzbNGyrTwWHAgg1CqkSgeg The wait to be seated for brunch on Sundays can be long, but well worth the wait! I was one of a party of five and we purposely ordered a little of everything on the menu, so we could all sample one anothers' food. 

From the red velvet waffle, to the butter pecan waffle with pieces of banana mixed in the actual waffle, to lemon poppy seed french toast topped with fresh fruit, to fried chicken, to chicken sausage, to fried green tomatoes with pimento cheese, to biscuits, to  cheese grits - EVERYTHING was perfectly prepared and taste sooo good!

Don't even think about eating modestly if coming here! Prepare to pig out and to have your taste buds awakened!  Enjoy!
