4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw This is usually our go to restaurant for breakfast when staying in Vegas. Although I've never been impressed with the service (our experience has ranged from indifferent wait staff to down right rude), we continue to come because of their gluten free options. Today we are here for breakfast and was sorely disappointed in both our service and food. My wife and mother in law ordered a dish that came with bacon. The bacon was literally burned to a crisp and tasted burned. We asked for new bacon and informed the waitress that we didn't want our bacon burned. A few minutes later we were brought bacon that looked identical to what we just sent back...burnt to a crisp. Rather than send back yet another side of bacon and waste more food we just accepted it. We were disappointed that the waitress didn't take initiative and tell the kitchen that what they were sending out again was not acceptable. Overall, we will come back but the restaurant needs serious work in customer service skills.
