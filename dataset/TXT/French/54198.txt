rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw By far the BEST French restaurant in Vegas! Bardot is a hidden gem inside Aria casino. Food is amazing, I was surprised to see how many vegetarian options they have. We started with their endive, walnut and blue cheese salad which was amazing. My husband had  chicken and my 10 year old devoured the filet mignon. I had the parisian gnocchi which was the best I ever had. This place has the most creative and delicious sides. Their macaroni and cheese is truly unique, picture attached. We also tried their chick pea frites with eggplant caviar, so delicious!! Wine selection is very good, they have wines from all over the world. However full you are, dessert is a must try. We had their creme brûlée and giant chocolate macaron and Mille feuille, couldn't decide which one was better. 
They have a great happy hour too.
Highly recommend!
