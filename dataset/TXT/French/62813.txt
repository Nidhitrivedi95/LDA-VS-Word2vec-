SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ Trusted YELP patrons once again..... and they proved themselves!  Talented, artistic chefs....Korean beef soup with a bit of kimchee and brown rice...just enough heat.  Who would have thought a soup could be so filled with flavor!  Fresh Fish of the day was Barramundi....perfectly prepared...moist, with a sauce that hinted at mustard grain.  Don'miss the mussels...the broth and fresh crusted bread is the perfect compliment.  Great for a date....sit on the outdoor patio.
