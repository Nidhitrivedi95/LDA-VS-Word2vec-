P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ Excellent 2 Michelin stars and AAA restaurant. This is an upscale, quiet place so it would be wise to bring a friend with table manners. The staff  was quietly attentive, I was surprised that the waiter spoke to me in french in the beginning. I know it's a french restaurant but we are in Las Vegas, not at the Paris location. The food is great, you can order a lat carte or set menu. 

I would love to return on another special night hopefully in Paris after checking with my financial adviser.
