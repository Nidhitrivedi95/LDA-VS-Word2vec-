4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Came here for brunch on a Saturday.  I like the fact that they allow you to make reservations less than an hour before you arrive.  Brunch is packed, so reservations recommended.  The patio would be perfect for a nice day, but in 100 degree weather, we decided to sit inside.  Ambiance & decor is nice/romantic and service is good.  This restaurant would be nice for a date, casual brunch, or bachelorette brunch.

The food.. delicious!  We had oysters, strawberry waffle, eggs benedict, corned beef hash.  The oysters were really fresh - highly recommended.  Everything was well made and tasty.  We expected the brunch menu to be a little bigger (they only had about 5 main items).  For those who like bloody marys.. they have a bloody mary's DIY bar and they can make a really yummy, savory and spicy bloody mary.
