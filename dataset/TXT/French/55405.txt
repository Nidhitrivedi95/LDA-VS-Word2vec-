rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I think Bouchon probably deserves 3 stars based on my first visit, but I'm willing to give it another try. It is a very pretty dining room and the atmosphere was really nice. My boyfriend and I went for brunch on a Sat. We ordered chicken and waffles, steak frites, 1/2 dozen oysters, and cocktails.

Just briefly...
Bread and butter: awesome soft butter...hard bread
Oysters: really fresh but specify what types of oysters you want to your waitress
Chicken and waffles: pretty good but nothing out of the ordinary
Steak frites: good

My only compliant, which isn't really a complaint because the staff was really nice...is that I wish we were served by one person only so that's it's more consistent and timely. We had our waitress and different servers who delivered each of our items. Our items came at odd intervals. There was a big gap between the bread and butter and our oysters, our main dishes didn't come at the same time...and when I asked the waitress if my drink was still coming after we had started our dishes, she seemed genuinely surprised it hadn't. Maybe it's because the bartender delivers the drinks himself? I'm not really sure, but that would be my only suggestion, one person to take care of everything or better communication.
