hvjgF-vnPw2jyL5DBuB0qg We came here because of a friend's recommendation, not because we knew anything about the celebrity chef. Maybe it was that ignorance that prompted us to boldly call the restaurant at 8 on a Saturday night to see if they had space for 2 (they did!)

The restaurant is lovely, and the neighborhood is gorgeous. I agree that it's pretentious that they don't have a sign, but whatever, we found it. My partner got the foie gras and the lobster special and proclaimed it delicious; I had mixed greens and Steak Diane... the sauce was wonderful. We had great service at the bar, it was all very convivial and warm... a very nice experience.
