HojKatUfX4UHWaPqtl63NQ Had a wonderful experience last night at Rivea. Our server, Christopher was absolutely fantastic. He was attentive and was very professional. The service, sommelier and everyone else was all extremely accommodating. Food was all fantastic as well. The view and decor was unreal as well. Definitely a great place to have a great dinner.
