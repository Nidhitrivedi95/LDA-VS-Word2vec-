jLxeBgWhLRbII2ACkgH1Sg I had such high hopes for place unfortunatley not. This place has a nice atmosphere and really comfortable and relaxing. 

Me and my wife went there for brunch on a saturday for the first time and had the french onion soup which was really good also had a couple of quiche's which were awesome. 

The following weekend we went there again brunch on Saturday ordered the onion soup which I was told it was not made,understandable that happens once in a while.Then my wife odered the fig bread again they didnt make it that day ended up having the chili which was really good and bought the garlic/onion bread which was great. Also had the quiche which was awesome.

So Monday rolls around and I'm in the mood for the chili I had the other day so for luch I head there.I get to the counter and order the chili then the cashier tells me they didnt make chili today I get so pissed I leave without getting anything.

On to Wednesday I was in the mood for their chili once more. This time I call to see if they have it and long and behold no chili today! Good thing I didnt waste my time again going there!

Why not make these great things on a daily basis!  Their menu is limited as it is.

This place has the pontetial to be great unfortunatley they have to get their stuff straight. Will not be going there for a while tired of getting dissapointed!
