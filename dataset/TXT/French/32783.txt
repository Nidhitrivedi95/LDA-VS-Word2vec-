h_ypoQ2rmwX8UGSmohsGiQ VERY VERY slow service. Went around 8:30AM. Only 2 people in front who ordered coffee (americano and cappuccino). Took almost 10 minutes to take their orders. Finally received double espresso. The coffee was very sour (some like that flavour profile, I don't) and gritty (beans too finely ground). I won't be going back.
