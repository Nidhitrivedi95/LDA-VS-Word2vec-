Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA I probably liked this place more than I should since we got in free for being a Mandalay Bay guest. The view was extraordinary and the drinks weren't over the top expensive.  I realized that Belvedere is my favorite vodka...and SKYY Vodka is the well at every place in Vegas.  The music really wasn't bad either. And I didn't feel like anybody's mother...which was AWESOME!!!
