xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g We had the best 1 year anniversary dinner! They seated us at the very corner of the tower overlooking the fountains. It felt like we had out own private restaurant because we weren't able to see anyone.

The food was amazing! You think french and you think small portions. This was not the case. We were stuffed when we left. They kept bringing us more chocolate through out the meal to try. We ordered 2 desserts thinking they would be small. Nope! And they brought us a complimentary dessert. 

I would go back for dinner, but I'm afraid it could never live up to the first amazing meal. I would have to go back at lunch just for the views.
