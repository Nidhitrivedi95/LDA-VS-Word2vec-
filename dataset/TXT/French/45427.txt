mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q I was trying to figure out the number of stars to give L'Atelier and finally settled on 2 stars because the definition "Meh. I've experienced better" is exactly how I felt about L'Atelier.

Every aspect of the dining experience was underwhelming, starting from the menu that was presented to me with bread crumbs all over the pages (which made sense actually, because the bread was so hard that it was hard to cut with a knife without crumbs flying everywhere). The wine menu was far too expansive, and the problem was further compounded by not being able to flip the pages properly because the holes weren't punched into the menu pages at the correct distance from the edges of the paper.

Having feasted at Bacchanal in the afternoon, my boyfriend and I weren't very hungry, so we ordered a selection from the menu of small tasting portions: foie gras stuffed free-range quail with mashed potatoes, caramelized kampachi with soy and endive salad, poached baby Kusshi oysters with French salted butter, tuna belly confit on a young vegetable gelée, lobster bisque, and a sea urchin dish with pea gazpacho. 

The dishes were definitely hit-or-miss, sometimes within the same dish:
- The foie gras stuffed quail was very rich. I didn't have much of it, but my boyfriend seemed to enjoy it.
- The kampachi was saturated with soy on the outside, making it too salty. The inside, which was rare, was much better.
- The baby Kusshi oysters were some of the best cooked oysters I have had and definitely the best plate we had. Try it with a sprinkle of the spices on the side.
- The tuna belly (which was cooked, sadly enough) tasted like what I can only imagine catfood would taste like. It was extremely salty and had a strange chewy texture I didn't like. I took one bite and handed the rest to my boyfriend. 
- The lobster bisque was good, although the morel mushrooms didn't do anything for me. I would have preferred just the bisque, without the added chunks of lobster and mushrooms.
- The sea urchin dish was good, but would have been better if it were less chilled.

The service overall was fine, but slightly sloppy. For instance, they didn't list the correct year for the type of wine we ordered from the menu. The waiter was dressed in a somewhat sloppy manner, with half of his black shirt tucked in. The overall experience left a lot to be desired - it was the least impressive experience I've had at a 1 Michelin-starred restaurant or equivalent (L'Atelier was awarded 1 star in the 2009 Michelin Guide for Las Vegas).

That being said, the diners around us seemed to enjoy the meal immensely. I'm sure there are those that would enjoy L'Atelier during a Vegas vacation (say, those from small towns or cities who don't usually have access to some of the best restaurants in the country).  I just didn't happen to be one of them.
