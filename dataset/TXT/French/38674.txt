jLxeBgWhLRbII2ACkgH1Sg Been here i believe twice. For the past two years, been my place to go for breakfast before an early start for the yearly Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in January.

Location may be a little "hidden" as it is adjacent to Sahara but it is adjacent to Paymon's. If you see Paymon's, you have arrived. LOL 

First thing i notice when i enter? A variety of various fresh baked breads and goods all laid out behind the glass for your eyes to drool over... and stomach to rumble to... ;_; Second thing noticed??? PEET'S COFFEE ! O.O ! Hello. Those from the bay would recognize it easily. I'm not from the bay but a pretty frequent visitor and i love their coffee ! I tend to opt for Peet's over Starbucks if i'm in the bay =X that's pretty good right? XD 

1st time, i had the Croque Madame, Peet's Coffee. For those who do not know, a Croque Madame is a classic ham and cheese sandwich with a bechamele (spell check) sauce and a fried egg on top. sounds amazing no? their variation is pretty good. If anything, i think i prefer it over the one from Payard's Patisserie and Bistro inside the Caesar's Palace !  

2nd time, i got the Rustic Sandwich, Peet's Coffee, and Strawberry & Nutella Crepe. Rustic sandwich is a simple sandwich in a baguette with thinly sliced prosciutto, thick slices of mozzarella, topped with a nice light pesto sauce. Really nice combination, in my opinion. The saltiness from the prosciutto together with the subtle flavor of the mozzarella and pesto is well done. And ! its fairly healthy too ! or id like to think so anyway. 

Really nice place to go for a nice coffee and a snack or even a nice meal. Prices are fairly decent and reasonable. Decent amount of sitting space. Free charging station and wi-fi for those who needs a quick charge during their meal or while working on their electronics !
