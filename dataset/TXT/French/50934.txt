oZHbPhIj01_31jqD053a_Q I went to Europea for lunch with two friends. We ordered the 5 services tasting menu with wine pairing. 
The amuse bouches were nice but there were not many as some of us with allergies had our servings taken out without being offered anything else. Our orders were taken promptly and two plates of butter (not three) were brought but we had to wait and finally ask for the bread.
The lobster and truffle cappuccino was nice but not memorable and my waitress spilled some of mine on the table, it was not cleaned nor replaced. We were also disappointed with the first wine that was served.
The squid pasta was a nice play on texture but we enjoyed the foie gras most with the langoustine crunch and the wine that was served with it was very nice, we just wished there would have been ore than one tiny brioche with it.
The beef was also good although I asked for saignant and got à point but it remained succulent.
They had barely cleared our plates that the desserts came out. The madeleines were very good and the cotton candy was a nice touch but added nothing taste wise. The lemon verrine I found too heavy and none of us enjoyed the thick shard of sugar.
Still for the price it is a good value for lunch, but I did not think service was great and we definitely were rushed to finish our meal.
