2gUbgbdJ7IFSbicBXlSchw LOVED IT!! Really nice, courteous, accommodating staff. We came in on a recommendation from a friend, around 8:30 on Saturday night, without a reservation, and the staff did their best to accommodate us. The food was delicious, the service wonderful, we were thrilled! I should mention that we, as a group, are not easily impressed, we dine out a lot, and are fortunate enough to live in cities that offer fantastic food and restaurants. L'express was the dining highlight of our vacation! Thank you L'express! Keep up the great work!!
