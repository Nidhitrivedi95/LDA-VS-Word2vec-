nk9lP-iXi7xklwN3VYf6Ew Want to sit all day and drink a coffee with your laptop?  This is a good place to do it.

Want to eat a normal, timely breakfast?  SKIP AVOID BEWARE.

Came down before my work pickup and budgeted myself 30-45 minutes for breakfast.  This is what we ordered:
* A coffee
* Oatmeal
* A bowl of fruit
* A bagel

These four items were not even delivered to our table in 45 minutes!  My pickup had arrived and I had to ask them to package it to go.  It took them another 10-15 minutes to package it up, and when they did they didn't provide any silverware to eat with.  Asked for it and within 5 minutes I knew I had to leave.

There was 1-2 other tables eating in the restaurant.  I know they have to do the whole hotel but come on, coffee, oatmeal, a bowl of fruit, and a bagel is not a crazy order.  The bagel didn't even start toasting until I asked for it to-go.  Oh, and by the way, the expensive oatmeal is INSTANT OATMEAL!  I saw the guy making it from a Quaker Oats bag.  Uhhhh no.
