aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw It was my first time trying this bakery! I heard good things from my brother and sister-in-law. There is a special on the macarons if you buy 5 then one is free. Each cost $3.25. They are so delicious. The salted caramel flavor has real caramel. They are a good size too so you can share with others if you want to get a variety to try. I also got a Kouign Amann which was really good! The only downfall is that we asked for one vanilla macaron and instead the worker gave us a raspberry. I guess I'll just have to go back and try it! ;D
