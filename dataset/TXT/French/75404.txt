yCa7CSRK65U_ZtzRB3XtGw Went with my wife for appetizers and dessert to celebrate our anniversary. First, it is probably one of most beautiful restaurants we have been to (definitely the most beautiful in Cleveland). We sat on a patio and it was just perfect. The service is top notch, very polished. Assistant GM/sommelier (Robert) and our server (Easton) is absolutely top notch, let us try some great wine and ports (as we are not wine lovers, this was great experience to try something very good and unexpected). Appetizer were good, except Foie Gras Gateau (I would skip that dish and take that off the menu), desserts were top notch and dessert wines are great. Great experience overall!
