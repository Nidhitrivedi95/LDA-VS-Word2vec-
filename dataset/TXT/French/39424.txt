jSfnItqaOnEp2nenVF7fCg I must be nuts. This place is across the street from us and it took an old buddy to tell me about it yesterday. So we golf carted over there for brunch. Delicious and not expensive. Had eggs Benedict for the first time in years. I'm trying lunch real soon. Considering that the place was packed, it didn't take long. Be sure to make reservations.
