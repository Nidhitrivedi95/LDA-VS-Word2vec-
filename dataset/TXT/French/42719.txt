I ordered the cappuccino and there was a pitiful amount of foam. It also tasted almost sour. The macarons were beautiful and delicious though, and you can never go wrong with the eclairs either. The tuna salad sandwich was disappointing though. My friend ordered the salad with goat cheese, chicken, and strawberries, which looked really fresh and there was a large portion of it, so perhaps I'll try the salad next time. 
The tables needed to be cleaned - there were empty dishes and mugs on a few of them too.
The workers are friendly, and patiently explained the flavors and such for the pastries.
