rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A We came for breakfast on a Saturday morning at 9:30 AM and there was a 10 min wait.

Ambiance:  clean, modern aesthetic.   There's a large waiting area.   They have indoor and outdoor seating.  Tables are bit close so you may hear your neighbor

Service:  below par.  Waiter got our order wrong.  Host was not very friendly and seated a couple who came later before us.  We brought it up and she didn't care.

Food: the food is great here and forgives the poor service.

#free bread- delicious, fresh and very crunchy
#potatoe leek soup-  must try here.  It was superbly made and great balance of taste.  Not too heavy
#madam croquet-  impressive looking.  Not very big but very yummy.   Fries were perfectly crispy
#eggs Benedict- over fresh bread not English muffin.  Yummy with ample side salad

Overall we had a nice time.  Restaurant very nicely decorated and food was good.  Took one star off because of the bad experience with the host and waitress.
