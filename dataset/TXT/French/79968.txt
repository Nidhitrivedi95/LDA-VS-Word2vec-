ZrHU8ZzwZQjTRpB1K_8JTQ As our server approached our table for the first time, about 5-7 minutes after we were seated, the first thing out of the server's mouth was a personal anecdote about his son rather than asking how we were and whether we wanted to start with anything to drink.  
We waited 20+ minutes after ordering for the soup and salad course.
The prime rib was dry, horseradish sauce was bland, the burger I ordered medium-well came to the table well-done.  Brussels sprouts were undercooked.
Each time he approached our table after the food was served, our server made comments about how his "mouth was watering," and how our food "looked very good."  When I'm at a restaurant, I don't want to be told how my food looks when it is served, or how much the person serving my food wants to eat it.
Very unappetizing and unprofessional, and we will not be back.
