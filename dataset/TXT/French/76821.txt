ysJo5Jdo29XOBCnKrbUKWg While the food was good the dining experience was extremely disappointing, especially for a pricey French restaurant. I realize that this was not the fault of our server but the kitchen and management handled it very poorly. Our party of four had the last reservation for brunch on Mother's Day. After the drinks and Appetizers the experience was very unprofessional and inexcusable. Two entrees were initially served followed by the third about 7 minutes later and another 5 minutes before the final entree was served. By the time the last was served everything had become cold. The steak hache ordered medium rare was very well done but was replaced with a Filet, only because they ran out of the hache (and baguettes and pear tarts as well). The worst part is the manager did NOTHING but cop an arrogant attitude. There are many other restaurants that I will frequent but Paris 66 will not be one of those.
