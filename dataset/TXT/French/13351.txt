4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I have loved eating at Monami since my first visit.  The staff is always nice and helpful, and the food is delicious.  The first time I came, I had the filet mignon which was the best fillet I had tasted to date.  Always have to munch on the bread & butter, carrot spread or pate.  Try to put your name in for the patio seating at night so you can watch the Bellagio water show while eating.  We always make it a point to have one meal at Monami while in Vegas.  Breakfast dishes are also very good and the coffee is perfect.
