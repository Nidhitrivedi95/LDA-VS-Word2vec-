FRuuIDOd21pTJHvEGIt1Gg Solid as I recall it to be. Both my fiance and I had the hangar steaks with shallots on sat evening. Simply Devine.  I could not ask more of a hangar steak. Service was professional, respectful and very knowledgeable. Highly recommend to any in search of a classic french bistro in montreal!
