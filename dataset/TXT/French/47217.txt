O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q Came on a saturday afternoon awaiting Lavo Brunch to kick off next door at 2pm. 
To my suprise starting at Noon it was buy one get one free house wines, well beverages and coronas.
I had the house cabarnet, served in a generously sized mini carafe was my second glass. Not bad for a house glass, sweeter side like a pinot, but the drinkability of a merlot.
My buddy had makers on rocks, but filled the entire glasd with makers to the rim. Not complaining at all, the bartender definitly hooked it up with two beverages in one glass. Nice touch bartender
We proceeded outside because it was a beautiful day, sat under an umbrella table with a gorgeous view of the strip!
We wanted something light to munch on so we ordered the bread, jam, and cheese. Toasted french bread, with a prune and dates jam(whole fruits still in), honey spread with pieces of honeycomb still in, and a delisously two+ year aged parmesan. Seems odd to eat together, but it was an excellent pairing.
Welcoming tentative staff, great view. Definitely recommend dining out on the patio before it gets to hot out here in the summer
Enjoy :)
