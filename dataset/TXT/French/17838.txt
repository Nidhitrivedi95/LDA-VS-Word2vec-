9ot8oInkYZTt6wkkGe__vQ I went here last October for a family gathering to celebrate my Uncle's life.  This is my aunt's absolute favourite restaurant.

We had a customized menu, of which I had the fortune to try the Chou Frise, Salmon, Beef (from my daughter's plate) and Tarte Frangipane and Mousse au Chocolate (again, from my daughter's plate).

Everything was absolutely delicious.  

I have taken away one star, only because of the $$$ (although I know it was worth it, they could make it slightly more reasonable), and the parking issue.  I paid $30 for parking only to find out weeks later from my aunt that they validate parking.  Really?  The hostess could have advised us on our arrival.
