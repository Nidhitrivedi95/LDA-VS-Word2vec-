4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw We had a fabulous dinner here. We made reservations and very glad we did because the wait was for 1.5 hours on Saturday evening around 6:30am. We started with the smoke salmon with creme fraiche and it was very tasty and fresh. We then ordered the French Onion Soup that was a nice size for two people to share. I also ordered the chilled gazpacho which was prepared perfectly and was also a large portion. My husband ordered the steak and I ordered the grilled chicken. Come hungry here because the portions are definitely Americanized and not the typical french size portions as I was expecting. My chicken was cooked nicely and not dry at all.
We saw another guest eating the baked goat cheese in a marinara sauce which looked like a good dish to try as well.
our table was right next to the patio and we got to view the Belaggio's show throughout the dinner.
We will definitely be going back. I really felt like I was in a large french restaurant and the ambiance was set just perfect to enjoy a great meal, with pricing just right for the setting.
