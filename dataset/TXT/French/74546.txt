xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g Came here with family so I was able to try a number of dishes.

New York Strip Steak w/ Bone Marrow and Cabernet Reduction was excellent (this is what I ordered and would order again)
Filet Mignon was okay, not as good as the New York Steak
Sea Bass was whatever, definitely not worth $44

Mushroom side was terrible, asparagus was nothing to write home about.

The chocolate cake was amazing (not the souffle, the regular mousse type cake.)

One turn off is that they had forced gratuity of 18% on a party of 5.  Considering we had a $740 bottle of Hundred Acre Cabernet, the tip got pretty high.

Regarding tipping on expensive wine, I did some research on the internet and apparently you ARE supposed to tip on the full amount of the bill including the wine, even if the wine dominates the bills.  I guess I'll be ordering cheaper wine in the future.
