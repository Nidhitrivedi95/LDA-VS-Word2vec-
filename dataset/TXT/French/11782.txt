4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I used to LOVE this place.  As a veggie lover I used to love their vegetable platter which is now off the menu and replaced with some pathetic veggie broth thing that I could easily make (and it taste much better) at home.  If you are vegan or vegetarian just skip it and go to the Wynn or Encore where EVERY SINGLE RESTAURANT has excellent vegan options (many with vegan bread and butter).  Now for those people that don't care about veggies I will say the place has gone downhill in general. Last time we were there they were out of duck (so no duck confit at a french restaurant) and I think all foul for that matter.  We told the server we did not like the new veggie broth dish and did not like whatever my wife order in place of duck and she did not offer to take anything off the bill. It is the only time I have ever tipped just 10% at a fine dining restaurant and I haven't been back since.
