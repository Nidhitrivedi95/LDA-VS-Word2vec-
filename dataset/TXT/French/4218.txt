2gUbgbdJ7IFSbicBXlSchw I ended up here the day before Canada Day. My friend and I were looking for a place to eat at 11p after having a couple of drinks at the bar. Everything around the hotel seemed to be close but someone recommended Le Express because they served food until 2a. The place looks like a diner mixed with a white table cloth restaurant. The servers were nice, fast and polite. I ordered some bread to tame my hunger and to my disappointment it was incredible hard and chewy. It was served with cornichons and Dijon mustard which I found incredibly delicious! I decided to order one of the specials which was spaghetti and mushrooms. I have to say for a pasta without a lot of sauce but to have so much flavor, even without cheese, I was amazed! My friend ordered the croque messieur which was amazing but the French fries were atrocious. So, I guess it all depends on what you order and what time you arrive. I would definitely go back in a time of need.
