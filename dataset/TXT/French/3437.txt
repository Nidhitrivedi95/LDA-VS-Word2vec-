6:50 - Oh emm gee, the amuse was appetite whetting and an annoying tease. I'm absolutely starved and craving more.

7:00 - Pre-apps arrive and I'm ecstatic. Delicious croquettes, rich foie gras torchon, silky smooth chacuterie, deeply flavouful terrines, accompanied with some of the most amazing bread I've ever eaten. Getting my wine glassed re-filled and I'm feeling all warm and fuzzy.

7:27 - Sharing four dishes as our real apps, fish soup, steak tartare with fingerling potatoes, deliciously creamy and garlicy escargot, more croquettes. Second bottle of wine ordered and opened.

7:45 - Happily waiting for mains, good conversation, good people, all smiles.

8:00 - Still waiting...  Haven't seen our waitress in a while, getting a bit drunk at this point. 

8:21 - Our food finally arrives and... hey! it's extremely disappointing.  The duck marget was imo inedible as it had an extremely bitter flavor akin to cough medicine, the cassoulet was flavorless - beans completely undercooked and difficult to eat served with chewy, unappealing duck.  The duo of beef was decent, but really under seasoned but at this point I had lost my appetite and enthusiasm to continue.

8:37 - We're informed that we need to leave as the second seating is about to begin.  No time of coffee or dessert, get out, you took too long waiting for your food.

9:00 - We take refuge at Splendido for our desserts and aperitifs (and more chacuterie)

What started off as a fantastic dining experience quickly soured and turned into a punchline for the rest of the night.  What a shame because Ici Bistro went from being completely awesome to total disappointment within a 30 minute time span.  Maybe we were just unlucky.. oh well.
