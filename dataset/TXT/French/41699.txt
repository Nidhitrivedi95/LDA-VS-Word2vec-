klzCMxmhrHWZeNseS4GKFg After a great experience just down the street I was ready for another excellent restaurant in Edinburgh. Unfortunately, nothing really clicked here for me. The presentation was nice for my fish plate, but the side bowl of veggies was just pure laziness. I only finished my soup out of principle. 

Some people next to me had meat dishes and those looked good.
