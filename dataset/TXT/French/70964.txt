xcmmTXhuMx2fZF2Bt69F4w Excellent lunch and brunch menus (sadly brunch is only Sunday) that make me, an omnivore, and my sibling, a foodie, very happy. It is very popular for meals on the weekend, so if you don't want to wait around, you might think of going at a non-standard time, like a late lunch. During the summer, there is a small outdoor area to sit in.
