_T7f2wUgNlJqxsR-cR89SQ Excellent food and service. The decor is a bit dated, but the gorgeous view of the city stole my attention. This restaurant is the perfect place to impress a date or even a client. It's quite pricey, but it's definitely well worth it.

I had the Yellowfin Tuna to start and it was absolutely delicious and full of flavour. For my main I had the steelhead salmon that came with the crispiest, most delicious skin I have ever had. For dessert I had the Honeycrisp Apple Kouign Aman, which was the perfect way to end the meal. It was crispy and buttery, and not too sweet. This was definitely one of the best meals I have ever eaten. No morsel went to waste. I can't wait to come back here!
