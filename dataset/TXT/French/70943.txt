xcmmTXhuMx2fZF2Bt69F4w We went for lunch, on a weekend -- no wait.  It is a cozy restaurant with great views of the neighborhood.  We got the Mediterranean Platter --- fresh veggies and hummus - very good.  And we got the red curry and zesty tomato mussels.   Overall, a good meal.  However, I will always be partial to the Belgian restaurant, Waterzooi, in Long Island, NY where they have 13 flavors of mussel pots to choose from.
