D87tFO-R6U8f4-e0r4Zq_g Crispy crepes that don't taste like eggy rubber! Very impressed by how filling the crepes are and TomTom is definitely a favourite (love smoked salmon). 

As others have already mentioned, their signature drink Lemonana is the perfect balance of lemon and mint, not too sweet, bitter, or sour. The mint isn't overwhelming either, so it's all very refreshing.
