Savory and sweet CREPES! 

And some of the best damn coffee ever. 

Plus you can't beat the sweet little french atmosphere. I totally felt like I was in Paris while I was here. From the music in the background, to the lacy curtains in the window, and the crepe pan practically table-side. 

Total cuteness!
