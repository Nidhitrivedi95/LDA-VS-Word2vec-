jLxeBgWhLRbII2ACkgH1Sg I think I just found my new favorite morning place. Very friendly, plenty of seating, internet-friendly, and most of all a great French bakery. Wonderful flaky/buttery croissants, hearty croques madame, and even the basic ham and cheese sandwich is great. The croque monsieur/madame comes with salad and an excellent dijon mustard dressing that is NOT sweet! :)

I had a croissant at Starbucks the other day that was so dry I had to choke it down with half a bottle of water. I was so mad, that I decided to just not have another one unless it was from an authentic French bakery. Patisserie Manon is actually closer to me, but is apparently closed for several WEEKS, so La Belle Terre French Bakery & Cafe it is from now on.
