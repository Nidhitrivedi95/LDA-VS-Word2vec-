FJMMPL3pxAPYGEPB0Hwlhw Delicious for Brunch! 
I was surprised for my Birthday with an amazing brunch experience at TOCA. I'm a lover of everything Ritz and I can honestly say they did not disappoint with the $85 brunch. Seems steep, but you DO get bottomless mimosas, (a heavy handed server) a cheese cave and a dessert cellar. Need I say more? I will. 

The eggs Benedict was surprisingly good for buffet style, the seafood bar was to die for (oysters, lobster, sushi, and jumbo shrimps- as big as my palm. ) Did I mention there's a cheese cave?! 

Not too pretentious either- just enough for a Sunday morning. Some patrons were a little peppery, however the delightful crowd of Pyjama-sporting-I-have-too-much-money-to-care patrons soon brought them back down to earth. 

Love it here! 

Cheese cave, dessert cellar, bottomless mimosas. 

*be prepared to have transportation home, don't brunch and walk. Could hardly move and it was worth it.
