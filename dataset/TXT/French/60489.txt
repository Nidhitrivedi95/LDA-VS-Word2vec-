SBnpT6JDbah-5l_52GM5sw I love the atmosphere here so much I swear they could serve me carrot sticks and I would be happy.  That being said they have a really solid brunch and tasty dinner.  Love their bloody mary.  Get the baked creamed eggs!!!  So good!  They present everything beautifully and I have never had anything I didn't like.
