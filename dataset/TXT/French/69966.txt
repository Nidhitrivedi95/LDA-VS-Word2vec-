WOO81gScY3_VpaIfXFAKpw The food was great and the service was excellent. If you want a quiet place to lunch or have dinner, try this place. A three course meal is very affordable and the gratuity goes to the students' scholarship fund. There is extra care and attention given to all details from the food presentation to the service. The students are very attentive to their tables. Friendly people here and I am happy to support this school. I have never had a bad meal here and I have been coming here for over five years. Sometimes they hold private events here and the restaurant is closed to the public so make sure you call ahead to make a reservation.
