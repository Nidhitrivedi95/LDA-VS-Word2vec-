t5QPwHMuPQn_kN809Ir6TQ Amazing hidden gem at Lake Las Vegas!! Dropped by today for lunch. Perfect spot for rosé on the patio. I loved how the chef makes the crepes in front of us. La Normandie savory crepe paired with some crisp apple cider.. if you close your eyes for a moment you feel like you're in France. Great hospitality and food! C'est parfait!
