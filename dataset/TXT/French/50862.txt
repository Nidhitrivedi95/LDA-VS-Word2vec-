oZHbPhIj01_31jqD053a_Q This is perhaps the MOST memorable meal that I have eaten anywhere in the world. I was worried that the atmosphere would be stuffy and the staff would be pretentious, but that could not have been farther from the case. My husband and I came here for dinner just a week before I gave birth to our daughter and I sometimes wonder if she came almost 2 weeks early so that she could escape my womb to eat at this amazing restaurant again. *giggle*  We had the tasting menu with the wine pairing (I know, I know, so pregnant and drinking alcohol is such a no-no, but I promise you that I had just a sip and hubby was hyper-happy to finish all my glasses for me). On the night we dined here, all of the staff here, from waitress to pastry chef to the chef de confiserie (yes, a restaurant that makes its own candy, try to top that!) to the head chef were all born, raised and trained in France. Even the surrounding tables had French patrons, we were starting to wonder if we were the only non-French in the restaurant. That aside, we cannot say enough about how much we enjoyed this restaurant! It is like Disney World for your taste buds. If you are looking for a bit of a splurge (anyway, it is still much cheaper than flying to Paris to eat at a comparable restaurant. Am I right?!) and you seek a memorable and amazing dining experience, then this is a must! Upon leaving, the maître d'hôtel gifted me with Jérôme Ferrer's (head chef and co-owner of Europea) amazing cookbook. Talk about a lovely bonus and souvenir! Reservations necessary.
