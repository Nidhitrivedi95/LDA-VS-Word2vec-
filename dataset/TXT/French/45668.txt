mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q Went here twice and tried the tasting menu both times. Excellent food, very creative with a strong punch on almost every dish. The deserts at the end are to die for, and the service is great. I recommend sitting at the bar, it's more fun and you get to see how they cook the food. Price was around 150 each with tax and tip but well worth it!
