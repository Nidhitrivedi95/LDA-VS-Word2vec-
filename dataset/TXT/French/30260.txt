FRuuIDOd21pTJHvEGIt1Gg Dinner menu is standard fair.  The lobster ravioli was bad.  If you love ravioli and you want a hint of lobster, go for it.  If you imagine fresh juicy lobster stuff inside ravioli...  skip it.

Their brunch menu is not as robust as La Cartet just down the street but not bad.
