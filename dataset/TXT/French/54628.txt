From the moment we set foot in the door, we were treated to candlelit lighting and a venture into classic Parisian style. The grandiose bar upon entry was simply stunning and I almost requested a perch just to admire it. 

We were lead to a booth seat which allowed for a view of the kitchen, and granted we enjoyed a late-night (after 10pm) meal, we noticed every member of the staff carried themselves as if it was the dinner rush, with the same hustle and care you might expect. 

Our server Kim, or LIl' Kim as she was labeled by her colleagues treated us with utmost respect, care and offered genuine suggestions to assist in our meal. Cocktails were super yummy and the pace at which the food arrived was seamless. 

In fact, the second round of cocktails my partner ordered was not as good as the first and our server happily exchanged it without billing us for the switch. 

We ordered the chickpea frites, the Chiteaux cheese, the Tarte Flambee and the Croque Madame. The first two options came on wooden and marble slabs, respectively and the portions were perfect for an amuse buche, In all honesty, I was feeling rather full after the appetizers. Our mains were scrumptious and clearly made to please. Savoury and well-orchestrated was the norm for the food we enjoyed here. 

The ambience is lends itself to being both modern & romantic. From the presentation to the portion size to the flavour Bardot's food went over and above our expectations. Their Chef is a wizard and we were delighted with every bite. 

If you are staying in Vegas and wish to blow your date away, take them here. Unpretentious service and reasonably-priced, decadent food - you simply cannot go wrong. Thank-you for a treat of an evening Bardot Brasserie -- we will most definitely be back!
