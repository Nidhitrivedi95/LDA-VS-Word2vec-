exz9aZqMqjpqzUOFBAl9Gg Lovely atmosphere, perfectly attentive waiter and love the "bring your own wine" option.  Menu was varied and there are a number of dishes I would like to go back to try.  Be aware, they serve large portions, good value for the money too.  As we are fequent visitors to Montreal I think we'll definately go back to try again.
