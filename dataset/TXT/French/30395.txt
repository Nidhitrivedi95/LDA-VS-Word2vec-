FUX9h1a37GJn9ge1baiNuw It's neat that they speak French here! However that was the only thing that really made a lasting impression on me. 

I tried their tomato soup which was very watery, didn't really seem hearty at all. 

The goat cheese quiche, I appreciate this being warmed up. This was pretty good but the dough seemed a little undercooked. 

Ordered one of the sandwiches, these do not come with the bread warmed which I would have loved. But maybe they are pre-made and ready to go. The baguette was good and overall a okay sandwich.

The chocolate croissant was not crispy with lots of flaky layers. It was like a doughy pillow. When you picked it up it would start to droop and did not hold it's shape. This was probably the most disappointing thing we tried. 

They only accept cash and check. For being such a large storefront I was a little surprised by this. 

Someone else at another table ordered some sort of smoked salmon sandwich. This I did not see on the menu, secret item!?
