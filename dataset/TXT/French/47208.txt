O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q I went here for lunch today and sat on the patio.  Beautiful day out!  I ordered a burger from their "craft beer" menu.  It was a french burger that had truffle cheese on it and a fried egg.  It was to die for.  It came on one piece of french bread.  Service was fast and amazing.  Great people watching place right on the strip.
