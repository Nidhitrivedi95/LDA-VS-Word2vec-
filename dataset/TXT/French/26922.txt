Dcj69NZJnbJhK-YHP_nULA The food is amazing, especially the moules frites. Arguably better than what I had in Belgium. The beer selection is good (considering that I just got back from Belgium yesterday, this is a compliment).

The staff is friendly and knowledgeable about Belgian ales. They helped my wife and I learn the ropes and build our Belgian ale vocabulary. They also helped us plan our time in Belgium with tips on where to go, what to see and what to try.

B5 is first on my list of where to go for authentic Belgian food and beer, beating out Chicago contender Hopleaf.
