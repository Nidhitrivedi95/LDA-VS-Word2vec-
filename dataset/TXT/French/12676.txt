4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I am sadly removing a star from what would have been a 5 star experience for the "host" situation. We arrived for brunch after driving and parking and walking all the way across the resort. There were empty tables all over the place, but when we said "party of 2" we were told there was a 30-40 minute wait. The patio was packed, as was the back room inside, so maybe they didn't have enough staff to cover all the tables, but that is unacceptable in my book. This is Vegas. You will get busy. Hire some people. We ended up getting lucky and finding a few seats at the bar. We ordered brunch and drinks there. I had the chicken & brie crepes and my husband ordered the lemon pancakes. We ate half and switched in between. Both were so delicious and believe it or not a good combination. The bartender was very good and hilarious. We almost walked away when we were told there was a long wait, but I'm glad we didn't. I wonder how much business they lose because of this? We have a few restaurants in Dallas that try to always "be on a wait" to give the impression that they are so popular that there is always a wait. I sincerely hope that is not what they were doing. It would be a shame because the food alone removes any need for pretension.
