gjCmXkMNVE0JSk8puUwv6g We came here last minute based on yelp reviews as we live on the other side of town. They have vegan and gluten free options, but also serve meat, so don't be scared off! The decor is clean, comfortable, and modern. The service was spot on with beautiful explanations of the specials. We had the broccoli guac which was yummy and smooth with a little heat. We ordered one special, cold pineapple and pepper soup which included yellow beats, crispy basil, and vegan mozzarella. I'm not vegan but this sounded so interesting that we tried it. It was pretty,  flavorful, and had complex tastes that caused us to stop and savor it.  We also had the goat cheese on toasted bread with carmelized onions, sweet pecans, and freeze dried honey crisp and greens. This was SO good!! We also had the steak salad with a tasty light dressing that included lychee. The exotic dessert was possibly the best thing I've EVER eaten. This place was amazing. The flavors and textures and beautiful presentation were spectacular. We will be back!
