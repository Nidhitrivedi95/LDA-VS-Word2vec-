U4e-0KtL2aPURQwbefjF3Q Dropped by for the first time today looking for a fast, cheap burger and was honestly surprised! The staff was super friendly and helped me in making a decision as what to eat. The meal was cheap and super filling. I honestly wouldn't recommend ordering fries because their burgers are HUGE.
