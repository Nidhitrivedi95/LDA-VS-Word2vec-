ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug Been eating here regularly since the resort opened back in 1999. I can't remember a time where I had any trouble except for when service might have been a tad slow with a waiter named Bill while they were really busy, but that was a few years ago. I've never had to wait in line to be seated with a Diamond Total Rewards card (Caesars Entertainment player's card), and they usually take our order and serve us first before other regular patrons. They also give a $1 discount on almost all (if not all) items with your Total Rewards card regardless of level/status. Food is average to above average and it's always comped, so I can't complain.
