QeFsIMcIFIJcOrpthYL8jg First stop on Montreal visit.  This was a really fantastic place.  We booked through opentable, no problems, got seated after a 10 min wait, since they were really packed.  The tables are a bit on the cramped side, but the entire place is very charmingly decorated and felt comfy and friendly.  We had a very friendly waiter, who pegged us as the leisurely tourist, so let us be, but still well cared for and not letting us feel neglected at all.

We were seated right up at the stage, which is not our first choice, but unavoidable because it was full.  Not a big problem, just a personal preference, and the trio that played that night was quite good and not too loud at all. 

The food was just delicious.  I had the BEST lamb chops, perfectly done and so tender.   Well seasoned, with potatoes and grilled-just-right veggies.  Hubby had the fish, which was excellent as well.  Well paired with an excellent bottle of red recommended by the waiter who didn't try to upsell us.  Topped off by a very yummy piece of tiramisu.

We had an excellent romantic night out, well chosen.  Great start to the rest of the trip.
