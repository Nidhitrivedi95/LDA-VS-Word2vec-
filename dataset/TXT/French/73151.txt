xNnZ5ksBY1gwwTV2Btb4Ag I was there with my husband and a friend about two weeks ago, we heard a lot of good things about this place and decided to try it out.
When we got there, the restaurant seemed very casual, very Montreal style! We were sat down right away but were left by ourselves for at least 30-40 minutes without water or menu. When we were finally asked for what we wanted to drink, the waitress took 30 more minutes to bring us 2 beers and 1 soda. 
Some of the dishes on the menu were pretty good but some tasted really weird. I ordered the steamed asian style horse bun, the bun was under cooked and they put way too much sweet sauce. I asked the waitress if the bun was suppose to be gooey and wet (think about when you just mixed flour and water together to create a dough without cooking the dough), the waitress told me that's how they make it, the dough is streamed and it's not suppose to be solid (very disappointing). Finally, it we ordered a tartelette to share for dessert, it took them 45 minutes to serve us the dessert and the tartelette was SUPER sour.
Our favourite dish was an appetizer dish that our friend ordered "Tempura style zucchini flower" and the "Salmon Tartar." 
I'm giving Salle a Manger only 3 stars because the service was really bad and the food was just so so with some interesting dishes on the menu.
