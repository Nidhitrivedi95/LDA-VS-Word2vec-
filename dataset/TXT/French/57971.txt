rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A You know the restaurant is fancy when you ask for poached eggs and they offer them hard or soft.. haha.  Consider yourself warned, this place is $$$$.

We ordered:
- Sourdough waffles awesome!  Never had them, would DEFINITELY have them again if I'm in the area! 
- Poached eggs (single order = $3/each) sit pretty on a piece of toast.
- French toast - It's more of bread pudding french toast with caramelized apples and it's 2-3 inches high!  It'll definitely pass for the sweet tooth lover in your life - this entree can actually pass as a dessert serving as well.  I thought it was overly sweet..

I love the feel of this place.. it feel small but is spacious and has a really high ceiling.  Their service is great too!
