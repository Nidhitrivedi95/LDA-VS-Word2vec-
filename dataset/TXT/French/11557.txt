4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Everytime we are in Vegas, my husband and I have to stop here for a meal, lunch or dinner. It's definitely become tradition at this point! 

It's French Bistro casual elegance with amazing service. Never felt like we were searching for the server, she was always near by and checking in on us. I do recommend making a reservation, otherwise the line to get in looks frustrating. 

Besides their delicious steaks (filet mignon always), the highlight for us is the chicken liver mousse pate appetizer. Everytime we order it we then say to each other "why didn't we just order two of these and call it a day". Maybe now that it's written down here we won't forget next time ;)
