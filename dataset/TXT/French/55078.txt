rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I've heard a lot of good things about Bouchon's brunch, but I must say I was a little let down while I was there the last time I was in Vegas. Although the restaurant is difficult to find, it is a rather lovely setting whether you're sitting inside or outside. This time in particular I sat outside and throughout the entire brunch we probably only saw our server 3 times.

We were seated and it took about 15 minutes for anybody to even approach us. We saw a male server hitting up all the tables around us except for ours. Finally a woman approaches our table and takes our orders. I asked for a coffee that took a while to get to the table. I decided on getting the corned beef hash with two eggs, which was recommended by our server and although the food came out in a timely manner, I didn't find anything particularly special about this dish. It was even a little bland and I wanted to ask for hot sauce but our server was out of sight for most of our brunch. When I was finally full and we were all ready to go, our server came back to check on us to see if we needed anything else. 

I'm sure there is a reason why people love this place, but I didn't see it the first time I was there. Food and service just wasn't up to par the day I was there.
