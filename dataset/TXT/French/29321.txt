EukD4hlPZXgSMpeya5iX2g This is a quirky restaurant unlike any other. I think the food is delightful but the decor is ... well ... yard-sale. The owner-manager, whom I believe to be a South African expat from the sound of her accent, takes care of customers in a kind of funny, clucking-hen, maternal way. It all feels very familiar, like a long lost relative decided to go ahead and open a restaurant in their own living room. And the cast of characters working and dining there make it seem like you've stepped into a scene from Coronation Street.

I suspect all the food on the menu is good from the moans of pleasure from tables around us, along with the lineup of customers arriving without reservations, but there are gems throughout the menu that will become your favorites. My guy loves the dressing on the oh-so-deceivingly simple bean salad. It is so unremarkable looking, it's like your aunt Millie poured the can of unico beans onto your plate. Yet the tangy flavour is absolutely, simply, DIVINE. How is that possible? And the mussels are scrumptious. We make mussels at home all the time but will still order them at Chez Laurent because the broth is 10X better. As a non-Italian lasagna aficionado, I can assure you the lasagna at CL is up there among the best Canadian-style lasagnas around. Oh, and the freshly-baked bread is downright dangerous to the appetite you'll need ... so be careful ... but if you ask for a doggie-bag (not for your Pug or Rottweiler but for yourself) they make a little basket out of tin foil so you can take your leftover meal home.
