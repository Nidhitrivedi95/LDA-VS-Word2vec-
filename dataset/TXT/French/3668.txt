27vF5LESbv4kFQfHZUDCnw I'm very picky about my crossiants (I blame spending a lot of time in France) so I wasn't expecting to like the crossiants here. But I loved it! It wasn't the fluffy airy crossiants that I usually look for but super flaky and buttery. Very tastey. I'll have to try the pain au chocolates next time.
