O66Zy8Y13VBm72ZDhS4fIg While staying at Harbour Castle, and heading up to Union Station, walking around dozens of underground shops, then heading North by subway to Yorkville (I always have to enter this area of unique little streets & shops to my list), I was getting tired.  (and thirsty)

It was time to find a chic place, sit in comfort, and treat myself to a nice glass o vino.  [ check marks all around - this is the place!]

From the moment I stepped into the entrance, I was warmly greeted by the hostess, addressed by the maître d, and was given great service by my own personal bar tender (I was mid-afternoon, so I had him to myself for a bit).  It was exactly what I needed and wanted.  A perfect little mini-vacation, within a vacation.

Loved the way it was designed and furnished.  Cute sofas at some tables.  A very special & posh place to visit.
