4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Excellent spot that is a must try while in Vegas. We booked a same day lunch reservation in the morning on open table for a window table with a view of the Bellagio Fountains. Thank you fellow Yelpers. Everything we tried was excellent. Chicken Liver Mousse Pate, Merlot and Classic Steak and Frites Rare, Prime Steak Sandwich and the lunch special Gourmet Grilled Cheese and tomato soup. Plus best Bloody Mary's I've had in a long long time. 
Skip the buffets and enjoy a real meal. $145 for 4 entrees, one appetizer, and 5 drinks I thought was money well spent.
