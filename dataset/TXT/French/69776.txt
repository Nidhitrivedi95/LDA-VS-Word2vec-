WOd8tWsh2Yt_osHv-ngx_w Had the most amazing experience at Universel. It was a very busy Sunday morning and the restaurant seemed pretty full but we were seated right away. Waiters seemed to speak French and English fluently. We ordered a combo meal, two eggs meal, and universel breakfasts. We also started with lattes which were prepared well and delicious.

My universel breakfast was HUGE; the portions are pretty crazy. The meal came with the crepe, the potatoes, two eggs, toast, choice of meat, baked beans, and fruit. This came out to be $18 Canadian dollars which is like $14 USD. Amazing deal especially for the cost.  For the crepe I added strawberries, bananas, and Nutella. The breakfast potatoes were seasoned very well. I don't typically like breakfast potatoes but I actually loved these. 

Service was great and we were attended to frequently. Great service, food, and experience!
