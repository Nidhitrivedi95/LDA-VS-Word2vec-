cNkm08qu--yjIY_NPxrS2g Located on the 44th floor in Place Ville Marie downtown, this bistro restaurant gives you a stunning view of the city. 

We came for a drink before heading to dinner. Since we were 3, we couldn't make a reservation because they only take reservation for groups of 6+. It was packed and we had to wait over an hour before having a table. For those who don't mind sitting at the bar, it goes faster and they have more room.

We started with a bottle of red wine and sparkling water. As appetizer, we got a plate of charcuterie consisting of 2 types of meat served with bread and pickles, and a plate of fried calamari served with a spicy mayo. The food is average so I will say, don't expect to get the best food in the city here. 

While the waitress poured us the sparkling water, I saw an eyelash over the lemon slice on my glass. I told her and she immediately went to change my glass, gave us a new bottle of sparkling water and didn't charge us for the first one either. All the staff was very attentive and friendly. The service was excellent from the beginning to the end. 

I've never come for brunch or dinner so I won't be able to tell you much about the main dishes but I will definitely recommend this place for a drink and appetizer while enjoying the beautiful sunset falling in the city.
