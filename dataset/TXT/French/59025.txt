rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w An amazing dinner with unbelievable service and ambience. Highlights were the crab stuffed with caviar and avocado and the potato wrapped bass. Both were amazing. The GM Ivo provides a top notch dining experience and the server Martin and sommelier Frederic made the dinner fun and memorable with their fun personalities. Will definitely be back!
