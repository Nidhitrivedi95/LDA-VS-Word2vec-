rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A An absolute Must Eat in Vegas! It has been on my list for ages, and I finally made it on my bachelorette trip last weekend. 

We went for brunch, and it was fantastic. Upon first inspection of the menu it appeared a little over-priced, but then you realize that most meals come with coffee and juice, a pastry, and fresh bread with butter and jam.

I had the Breakfast Americane which is two eggs any style, toast, bacon, and sausage. It was quite a lot of food, so much I couldn't even finish it. My sister had the Jambon et Oeufs, which is ham, eggs, toast, and Lyonaisse potatoes -- GET THE POTATOES. They melted in your mouth they were so good.
