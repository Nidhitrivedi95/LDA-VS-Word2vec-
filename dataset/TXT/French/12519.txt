4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I picked this place because of the great reviews, I have no idea what some of the bad reviews were about, but this was amazing. I was supposed to go with a friend, but they got sick, and well I wasn't about to waste a great reservation, so I enjoyed Mon Ami Gabi alone. Don't feel bad for me though. I was so happy with the food that I hardly noticed the pity looks. 

I wasn't a fan of the fact that reservations, and walk ups were in the same line, but whatever. I was there early enough that the line was not super long. 

I ordered the Paris romance drink, and it tasted as if they were able to create the sweetness of first love. The mussels were outstanding. The broth was even better with the french bread, and I wanted to bathe in it if it wasn't slightly unsanitary, and well I was already getting odd looks. 

I ordered the filet with mashed potatoes, and I think that my steak was cooked perfectly. For dessert I ordered the creme brulee, which so happens to be my favorite dessert. I wish I can say that this was the best that I have had, but it was still really good. Over all I would go back, and I really enjoyed everything. The wait staff was attentive, and nice, and nothing was big enough for me to not give it 5 stars.
