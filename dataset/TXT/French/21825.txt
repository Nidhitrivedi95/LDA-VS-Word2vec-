bgzMrz4qzEfJ7qqNthcveA Do you remember those experiments in high school involving hydrophillic and hydrophobic substances?   

That's kind of what this place is.

It's a drop of fine-filtered water in the Exxon Valdez oil spill that is Bloorcourt.

A beautiful room.  Elegant in it's simplicity.   

An open kitchen.  A chalkboard menu.   A small dining area.

It's one of the few places where you truly know that everything is good, because there are only a few menu items...and you can watch other patrons enjoying essentially all of the options as you wait for your chosen delicacy to arrive.

Everything is perfectly prepared.   

Everything is delicious.

I had what was over-simplified as "Pork Chop & Peaches".   It was superb.

The whole experience almost makes you forget that this place is right next door to the champagne room at a relatively nasty strip club.   You secretly hope that they don't share a ventilation system with the kitchen.

You imagine that every noise that you quietly overhear through the wall comes merely from the pleasant moving of tables and not from some hooker getting her head smashed open with a bottle.

As long as you don't face the window it becomes easy to become lost in the ambiance of outstanding cuisine.    

Well worth seeking out.
