xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g I remember we came here for July 4.

Anyway, like every reputable restaurant in Vegas, it's expensive as shit, go figure. And like all the rest, the portions are tiny, so get ready to drop half a bill on a meal the size of your fist and if you want wine, go in on it family style.

I ordered the filet and we got a bottle of wine. My friend and I ended up drinking 80% of it and the rest went around the table.

The wine, eh, I don't know anything about wine. It was the cheapest one and it tasted like wine to me, so all good there. I would say the tiny filet was disappointing but I pretty much knew what I was in for, so no big deal there.

The atmosphere was great, as you'd expect. Very nice view. There are some parts of the eiffel support that sort of awkwardly run through the restaurant but we didn't have any issues with them.

So why did I give this place a 4? Sounds like a 3, right? It does so far, to me anyways.

Well, before they give you the meals, they serve the bread. And here, the bread came in the form of these little cheese bread balls.

Hooooly shit, these things were incredible. I'm pretty sure I could subsist entirely on these things. It was like nirvana in my mouth. I'm pretty sure these will be an integral part of my last meal someday, and they're so soft that if I'm 120 and I've lost all my teeth by that time I should still be able to eat them. Rolled in the experienced hands of Chef Boyardee and cooked to a golden brown in what could only be St. Elmo's fire, these cheese balls were the highlight of my eating experience.

Call them and see if you can get the cheese balls to go first. If not, this place is worth eating at once at least.
