mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q Did the tasting discovery menu, was outstanding. standouts were the onion tart (maybe I should have done the white truffle supplement but it was awesome as is) and the oysters poached in echiere butter.  The orange dessert they had was out of this world. 

Very consistent, great service. Changed silverware after every course, very quickly.  

next time I may order off the menu though.
