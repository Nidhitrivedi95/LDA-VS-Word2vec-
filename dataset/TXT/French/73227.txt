Xrqd7hdpa5HYWdIegacTpw I have lived in Madison on and off for years and never visited, but I am so glad I finally got there.  I popped into the Admiralty Room one Saturday afternoon and was incredibly pleased.  I sat in front of the huge windows and watched people playing in the snow on the frozen lake.  There was hardly anyone there at the time, so it was very calm and quiet.  I could hear the people at the next table speaking German and the head waiter had a strong Italian accent which made the whole experience seem so continental.

The iced tea came with a lemon wrapped in a yellow net with a green ribbon, so luxurious!  The chicken sandwich tasted like a summer barbecue and it came with fresh fruit and a delicious mixed green salad. 
After the meal they brought two chilled chocolate truffles and the whole meal was maybe $10.

Wonderful way to spend an afternoon.
