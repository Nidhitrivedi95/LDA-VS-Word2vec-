sMAgnsqi-eY9LlywVC85Hg Our group had the table d'hote as I expect many do. The first courses were all good. Plentiful salads and a tasty avacado with shrimp were both hits.  The lamb shank lived up to its reputation and the grilled salmon wit asparagus was delicious.

The dessert was a dissapointment.  After multiple choices for course one and two, there is only one dessert selection but they sort of show you the other menu choices hoping you will add on.  

The service was friendly and helpful throughout. Our guy was a pro although he did knock over a couple of things on the table. The only real flaw in the evening was a glass of red wine that can to the table cold. Not chilled - cold. Really?  .
