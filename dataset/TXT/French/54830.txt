rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw Exceptional experience! Considering this place is brand new and probably still working out the kinks of opening a new restaurant, we had a fantastic experience here for dinner.

A few of the things we ordered included the foie gras parfait (delicious), charcuterie board and cheeses (had excellent selection on both boards). The pork chop was so tender.  My sister ordered the burger and loved it. Was very impressed by the meal as well as the beautiful decor. 

I loved that our waitress really knew the menu and seemed excited about the dishes she recommended. The service was wonderful and we were very well taken care of. Can't wait to go back!
