YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g I would actually rate this 3.5 stars if I could, but since I can't, I am rounding down. I was basically underwhelmed, I expected more from a Herbert Keller restaurant. It was by no means I bad meal or experience...the food was GOOD, not great,...and the wait staff was pleasant as well. I had a 4 course tasting menu of onion soup, a salmon dish, filet mignon in a red wine sauce with black truffle and foie gras, and a deert trio of a peanut butter shake, bailey's ice cream, and the chocolate lava cake...which by the way is really played out, I'm so sick of seeing that lava cake on every damn restaurant's menu. 

I think I ordered wrong...I played it safe and just went with the tating menu, so I blame myself. I would like to try this place again and not let myself be swayed by set tasting menus, because there seems to be some interesting things on that menu. By the way, the place has a very unique look to it....very high ceiling, private cabanas, stone walls, a flower petal sculpture thingy. Nice place.
