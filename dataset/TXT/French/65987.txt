udFcIcbWbxrO8uLF95WnQg Boar dish was poorly prepared, I miss took a pearl onion for a small potato, the red wine in the sauce wasn't reduced right and didn't pair well with the boar, there were mashed sweet potatoes on the bottom but wasn't mentioned in the description. The duck paprikash wasn't much better, the duck had a gritty texture and the sauce wasn't prepared correctly either, onions were over cooked and slimy. No speztle in sight. No one bothered to refill my soda even though it sat empty for half the meal, I would of asked for a refill but our server took our drink orders, brought us drinks and briefly asked us if we liked our food before we ever took a bite before disappearing and everyone else kept quickly running around. Never again will I come here
