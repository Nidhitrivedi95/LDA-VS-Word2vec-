rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Had breakfast here and was pretty satisfied with the entire experience.  While we waited for a table, there were free almond cookies.  We were seated outside and the entire area was shaded.  Everything we ordered was great.  I enjoyed the eggs benedict but I would order a different next time.  Complimentary break apart bread was also served with the order.  Pastries are a must try when coming here!
