rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A We have been here before and looked forward to returning.  What a disappointment!  The steaks were tough.  We ordered a seafood tower and the presentation was sloppy.  The shrimp were just thrown on top of the other shellfish.  The frites were not as good as they used to be.  The service was not up to par.  Thomas Keller should be ashamed of how his restaurant has gone down hill.
