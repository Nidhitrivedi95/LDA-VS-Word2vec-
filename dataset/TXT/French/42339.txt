L6RxkP8dneVGelDLUhjCug I like the food. I especially like the sandwiches because of how cheap yet delicious it is. They even had a buy 2 get 1 deal so I basically ate it the whole day. Their bun bo hui was a little spicy but I couldn't stop eating. Their service is also superb and accommodate all my needs. Definitely a place to stop by at least once
