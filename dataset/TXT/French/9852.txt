We were a group of 8 dining for lunch and we had a great well lit table on the patio near the outdoor area. Since it was a French restaurant I was expecting the prices to be a lot higher, but they offered a huge range of dishes at very reasonable prices. 

My bf and I ordered the full order of mussels (comes with fries) and the chicken paillard plus a bloody mary & their take on sangria, a frangria. We were satisfied with everything. I tried everyone elses dishes at my table and I can't complain about anything. Our table dined on: crab lump sandwich, eggs benedict, fish of the day, salmon salad & steak. The french onion soup was also a big hit. I'll definitely be back the next time I'm in Vegas.
