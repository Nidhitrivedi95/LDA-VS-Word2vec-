To the point that the dishes had begun to favor we not the same in any sense of the word. Our last visit nearly six months ago resulted in us deciding to keep our distance for a while. My boyfriend got the filet with red wine sauce, that the had been dreaming of,only this time it was so salty making it nearly unedible and causing my bf to believe the sauce contained MSG. I assured him this couldn't be the case. Since they pride themselves so much in organic, non gmo food they'd never add msg. Although I cannot confirm that this is the case. Today after a length of time, I decided to give it another shot, I began to order the salmon, avocado, cucumber sandwich, at which point I was informed they were "out of salmon for the burgers" and "only had the dill sandwich salmon". I proceeded to order my sandwich and waited for ky order. I was then told they were out of dill? In being the person I am, I nearly cancelled my order out of mere principal. However, I ordered it without the dill (bad call). In the meantime,I heard the girl take the orders of two other patrons only to inform them they were out of three other menu items. Those two customers left, deciding to eat else where. That is potentially nearly a $30 sale, gone. I understand being out of an item but being out of half your menu???? I hope you all the best with your new location, however, opening a second location with the way the first functions? You will need all the luck you can get.
