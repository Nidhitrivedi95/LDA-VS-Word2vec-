Went here on a Saturday night recently with a friend and sat at the bar for dinner (which I love to do). You get a great view of the amazing open kitchen and get to see the chefs prepare everything. So cool. 

The food was amazeballs. I had the charcuterie platter with homemade marinates and croutons as a starter. It was delish. The rillettes were amazing and it's a perfect starter dish for 2, or even for 1. 

I then had the beef tartare and was sooooo happy I ordered this. I kept seeing the chef prepare these and couldn't stop drooling. I asked for very "relevé" and it was soooo good and made to my taste. My friend had the oignon soup which was served in a very unique way (with bouillon on the side)... but don't stop there if you go for dinner, there seem to be so many incredible dishes (fish and chips looked crispy and delightful and the oyster platters looked yummy). 

The wine list was excellent, and as we learned from our friend at the bar, it is changed on a weekly basis. Love that. We took a suggestion from the sommelière at the bar and it was delish. 

I strongly recommend this restaurant if you're in the area of Rosemont or even if you're not close at all... It's worth the detour.
