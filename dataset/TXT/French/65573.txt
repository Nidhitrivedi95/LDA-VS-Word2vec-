U1LB3sRMGTu_h7Sf9QdNoA Don't let the decor and Parisian style fool you! It looks very cute and romantic from the inside, especially the decorations they have. 

My friends and I were here for dessert only since it's a nice little bakery. However, we were very disappointed even though we received good customer service. 

We tried the creme brûlée, apricot danish and profiteroles. 

I find it unbelievable that a French place can mess up creme brûlée; I've been to Indian restaurants that have done a better job. After breaking in the top, the inside was too liquidly! It was soup! I was having a sugar soup...it didn't taste any better either. Just basically like sugar and I've had creme brûlée at many places in my life and this was the worst. 

The apricot danish was too bitter tasting and cold. 

The profiteroles were too bitter with all the liqueur. 

The prices were $9 for each! Which I thought was expensive for the horrible quality of the products. 

Overall, I don't think I would come back to this place because the desserts sucked. I'm not sure about the lunch or dinner menus. 

If you're looking for lovely romantic Parisian type cafe go to Colette Grand Cafe instead! But better desserts and if you aren't satisfied with their food they will at least exchange it or take care of your bill. Where as here you don't have the luxury nor did they ask!
