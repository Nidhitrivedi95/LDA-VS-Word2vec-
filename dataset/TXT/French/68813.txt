voaZjLwStQEq9-wj7hFYBQ We stayed at the Balmoral hotel - which was okay, probably not worth the price.  Their reservations staff are not great - when we made the room reservation, we also booked the restaurant - with quite a few e-mails back and forth.  When we got there, they had made our reservation in their sort of dinky bistro restaurant, not the nice one.  So we tried to change it and were told that there were absolutely no tables available.  

When we went down for dinner, my husband said "let's just look in on the nice restaurant and see if they have a table"  I am so glad we did as the place was about half empty ,AND STAYED THAT WAY, which is too bad if others missed out on a wonderful meal.

The chef uses local, Scottish ingredients, so the menu changes.  Everything was deliciously prepared, elegantly served, and interesting without being odd or overwhelming.  We had a wonderful meal and found the service attentive and pleasant.  Like the hotel it is in, it is not cheap, but unlike the hotel, it is worth the price.
