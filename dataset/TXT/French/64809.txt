teTQU7TIPE0O_B1zN_239w My family and I have been going to MiMi's on Alma School & Souther in Mesa for Thanksgiving now going on about 8 yrs. So I completely have something to compare it with. Years ago the portions were large and you had actual leftovers just like you should on Thanksgiving. They gave you a huge slice of pie or yummy bread pudding. That was then. The bread pudding size diminished immensely over the years and now it got so small they don't even offer it. NOW, the price has understandably risen, I get that. BUT!!!! The portions are half, very scrawny and seem to lack the quality they used to have. The pumpkin pie was so small and had this crumb stuff  topping like they put on top of apple pie, it really took away from the pie not to mention how tiny the piece was the crumb topping was made to be half the piece, ick. The pecan pie size was just as tiny. They drizzled this gross carmel topping on it, never did that before either. I don't know what the heck they are thinking but I once thought of MiMi's as an awesome place to eat. Not any more. We are really considering changing where we go on Thanksgiving we were so displeased this year.
