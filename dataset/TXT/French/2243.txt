0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g This is my second time eating here and I'm glad I came again. We were celebrating a couple of birthdays and we were very happy with our experience. We got to meet the chef - Julian Serrano.  He was very sweet.  We were not seated close to the windows but our table still had a good view of the fountains.  The restaurant is beautifully decorated with flowers and plants.  We went with the prix fixe menu for $115.  I really enjoyed my quail salad, filet of black bass, and New Zealand Tai snapper.  For dessert, I had the poached pear with panna cotta and ice cream.  Upon leaving, they gave us a box with 2 mini muffins inside.  Service was friendly and attentive.  Would definitely come back for a special occasion.
