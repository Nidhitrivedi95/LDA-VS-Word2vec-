XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q It has been several months since dining at Joel Robuchon, but I still fantasize about the bread cart nearly every time I eat any type of bread.  I could imagine a meal just made from the bread cart itself.  But that would not do the rest of the experience at Rocuhon justice.

The decor, service, and food were all at the level of what would be expected of a three michelin star establishment.  From the moment we stepped into the quiet reception area out from the loud and bustling casino floor of the MGM, the experience was like no other.

Having experienced the Degustation Menu, I would have to write a book to describe what I loved about every item.  Here are the items that I enjoyed the most - albeit not taking anything away from the items not mentioned.

Bread - I can't say enough about the bread cart - I ate so many of the different breads that it made it difficult, but not impossible, to enjoy the main course of beef chop.

Caviar atop crab - I love caviar.  I love crab.  This combination dressed with a seafood gelee was amazing.  The detail in the preparation of the gelee and caviar looked like like an artist prepared it rather than a chef.

Green Pea and almond veloute - This dish gave me a newfound love of green peas - in a veloute that came together perfectly.

Foie Gras - This is what foie gras is all about.  Perfectly prepared, melt in your mouth, rich, but balanced with the cherries.

Beef Chop - Having lived in Texas for 12 years, it's all about steak.  I've had dry aged prime, kobe, akuashi, and several other 'best' steaks, but this seemingly nondescript 'beef chop' had to be one of the best cuts of beef I've eaten in my life.

The only regret I have is that Robuchon had such a great cocktail menu that we decided not to experience the wine pairings with the tasting menu.  I will definitely do that next time!
