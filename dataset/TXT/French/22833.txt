bzbNGyrTwWHAgg1CqkSgeg Freaking Fabulous! Went there on a Sunday! I suggest going early or be prepared to wait. Got there around 12:45 pm and it was packed! Waited while I had a mimosa (they were good). I went with my friend and we decided to get two dishes and split them. I got to try more than I would have eating alone! I got the eggs Benedict florentine style and added Canadian bacon. It came with cheese grits on the side. This dish was absolutely delicious. I even enjoyed the grits (I'm a bit skeptical of other states' grits). My friend ordered the red velvet waffles with hash browns as her side item. It was like eating Coke for breakfast! Sooooo good! The hash browns were on point as well! Overall good experience and the waiter was awesome as well!
