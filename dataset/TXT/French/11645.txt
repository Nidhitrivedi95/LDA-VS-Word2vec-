4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I came for brunch and was seated right away even though the place was packed. The waitress was very nice and explained the specials. I ordered the lobster roll and it was very nice. The side of chips were were very good salty and an easy crunch. The side salad also comes with the sandwich and it was healthy which I like. My friend ordered the blueberry french toast and he loved it. The iced vanilla cappuccino was very good. So is the coffee which they keep it coming.
