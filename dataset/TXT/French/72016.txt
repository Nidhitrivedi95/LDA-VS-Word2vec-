XI3iNUgChOfJk5ppjKVEQQ Very small but cozy restaurant. I liked cocktail menu made with a real book as a part of cover.  Cocktail was good (I asked something like mojito which wasn't on the menu) but not out of the world...

I thought pasta was overpriced.... same for mashed potatoes.. I guess the flavor of food was pretty well-balanced but not very memorable..especially for the price.

Complimentary bread was warm and OK.
