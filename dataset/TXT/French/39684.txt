K-b7obYsM_meX_GAd7rJTw Not a single veggie option. At lunch, we were a group of 5 and 3 ordered the lunch menu and I asked for an omelette as it was the only veggie option. They said my omelette might show up 5-10 minutes after my friends food, really weak. The food seems ok, but the service is average and their lack of a single veggie option leaves a bit to be desired.
