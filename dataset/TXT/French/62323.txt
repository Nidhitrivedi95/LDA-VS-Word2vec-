SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ This place is so versatile, it's great for lunch with co-workers, a meeting, happy hour with friends, or a date night on the town.  

For some reason, I LOVE all of the soups that House of Tricks has to offer.  I think this place has the best soup in the valley.  Random, perhaps, but give it a try! 

I like that they have a seasonal menu, and it changes with some regularity.  It's great to go back to a restaurant you enjoy and you find new and exciting food options to choose from. 

Working in Tempe, I've gone here for work lunches a few times.   I definitely recommend the French Dip - melts in your mouth, so flavorful!  Or...my other go-to is the Grilled Chicken sandwich with goat cheese.  You had me at goat cheese....   On the dinner menu, I've tried several fish dishes - salmon and halibut are my favorites. 

I love that this American style menu always has some unexpected twists and turns on the menu.   Definitely worth checking out.  And with the cute house vibe and great ambiance, this place will score big points for a date night too!
