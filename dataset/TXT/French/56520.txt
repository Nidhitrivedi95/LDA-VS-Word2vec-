rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A I am giving this place 5 stars because of the atmosphere, WONDERFUL service, and good food; especially the pastries. I ate here for breakfast and as soon as we were seated we were treated like VIPs.  It seemed like we were being pampered. I had the Breakfast Americaine which consited of two eggs, bacon, saysage, toasted brioche a pastry with oj AND coffee. Presentation wasn't what I was use to for breakfast food. I'm use to it just being dumped on my plate. This was done nicely. The other person I was with had the Croque Madame which is toasted ham and cheese on brioche with a fried egg with mornay sauce and pommes frites. I had some of hers and I wished I ordered that instead. 

At the end, we were happy and we gave a large tip to our waiter who was really grateful.
