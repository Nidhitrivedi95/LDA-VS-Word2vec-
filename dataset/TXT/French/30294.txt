FRuuIDOd21pTJHvEGIt1Gg Daniel and I decide to go into the old city because we want something good, french, and tasty.  We planned nothing.  We park, we walked across to a hotel and asked for a recommendation and we got this place.  What  a wonderful little bistro.  Now I'm sure it's not the best place ever, but there was nothing I did not like.  I ordered the creamy vegetable soup and the salmon and holy cow my taste buds were happy.  Daniel order the gravlax (oy so Jewish) and the veggie couscous with anise sauce and he was doing a little dance at the table.  He had a very nice red wine and I had probably the best Tanqueray and Tonic ever.  For desert I nearly died - I had this mouse-like ganache cake thing that was so rich!  Daniel and the creme de la sucre - sugar creamed with maple I think - whatever it was so good, and came with a side of nuts that he loved - we had to order another to take home with us.  The bar are is huge and the service was wonderful.  They even knew how to speak English so I didn't seem like a total jackass.  I would so go back here.
