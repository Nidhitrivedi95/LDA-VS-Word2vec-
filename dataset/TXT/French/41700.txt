klzCMxmhrHWZeNseS4GKFg Stumbled in here on a Friday night when we neglected to make a reservation elsewhere, and we were fortunate enough to be seated.  Excellent meal.  I got the goat cheese starter--sceptical at first, but it was delicate and amazing.  Same story with the veggie risotto--though I thought mine could use a touch more salt.  The key lime pie was one of the best I've had.
