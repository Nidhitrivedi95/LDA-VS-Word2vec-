DQFuOd8tUebBAcV5iTGfDA I'm currently in this addiction to macaroons phase and been spending my time trying different bakeries. Anyways, this one was feinately my favourite place. The macaroons were just the perfect texture and crunchy ness, they also have very unique flavours such as cookies and cream, raspberry cheese cake etc. I will definitely be back here.
