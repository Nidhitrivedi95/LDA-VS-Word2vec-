UxWH8zRYIBgs6Q2oykvRdw I am not kidding. I signed up an Yelp account for the purpose of writing the review for this restaurant. First, we waited for more than 20min for the server to take orders after we sit down in a not busy Monday night. And when I asked if there is any veggie on the side of the fillet mignon, the server educated me that "we are not a steak house, we are a French restaurant, so we don't have veggie on the side". Ok, fine. Thank you for telling me this with your arrogant attitude. So I ordered the Caesar salad, and they totally forgot! I was so upset and not to mention the fillet mignon was extremely over cooked. It tasted like fake meat. They forgot to give me the steak knife as well btw. At the end, when I told the server that he forgot the salad, he kept saying it's the kitchen's fault, with no apology. Me and my friend couldn't believe this happened. Anyways, I know the atmosphere and decoration is good here, but the food and the server could not match it.
