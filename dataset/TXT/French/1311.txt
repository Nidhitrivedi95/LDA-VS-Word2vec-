_T7f2wUgNlJqxsR-cR89SQ The service was incredibly fast and attentive. The food was like nothing we have every tasted and so delicious. We got the filet mignon, and the lamb they were both divine. The filet mignon was so juicy and tender, it melted in your mouth. The potatoes that came with it were amazing, my favourite potatoes I probably every had. The lamb was cooked to perfection and loved the sauce it came in. We also got the chocolate moouse with apricot sorbets. The sorbet was delicious, very acidic and fresh.
