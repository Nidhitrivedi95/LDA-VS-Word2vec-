gISrxk4A5dfrjDivkC-L-Q I visited Douce France three weeks ago and I return to visit again on Christmas Eve for my afternoon tea with two friends. We all loved everything we tried there. I got more surprises than last visit. I bought their glazed chestnut this time. For sure will go back visiting again and again...
