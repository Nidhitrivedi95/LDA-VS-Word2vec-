4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw When on the strip, you have two choices...super expensive yet really good fancy restaurants with famous chefs, or you can go to Mon Ami Gabi's and eat great for a reasonable amount of money.  I was there on business for three nights, so you can only go all out so many times.  Three of us went here for lunch.  One person had the crab cakes, which she said were great, another had the fish special, which he also said was great, and I had the steak sandwich and frites.  They have some of the best frites EVER!  I've been here twice and never had to make a reservation.  It's great people-watching, and if you go at night you get to watch the fountain/music show across the street at the Bellagio.  Overall, great location, great food, great views!! Fifth star would have come with a bit more diverse menu.
