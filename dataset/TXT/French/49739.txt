I also highly recommend the flan and chocolate croissants.  In addition to the pastries, the breads are great to take home for dinner.  The sandwiches are very well done.  The coffee is from La Prima so it is great as well.
The best time to go is during the week.  You may have to wait in line on Saturday and Sunday mornings.  If you get there too late on weekends, most of the selections will be gone.
