WOj8nPos3R9IIf0Pyttd8g It was OK.  

Upon a raving review from my boss' girlfriend, I took my girlfriend there for a late valentine's day dinner.  I booked reservations for 9PM on a Saturday.  We kinda needed them, but there was an open table anyway, so I guess you have a 50/50 shot.  

You can't order liquor.   My GF and I typically have a martini prior to dinner.  No dice here.  Only wine, and maybe beer.  

Appetizer - I read on yelp about the pomme frites, but we chose the Lulu plate instead (cheese, fruit and meat).  (I wanted the frites, the GF didn't.  I lost.)  The cheese was really good.  The meats were a bit weird.  One of them was proscuitto, but I am not sure which (btw, I know proscuitto - I still couldn't tell).  They had stuffed cherry peppers - those were soooo awesome.  But, the GF didnt love that one. 

I ordered the steak frites because I really wanted the pomme frites.  The meat was tough and not really tasteful.  Fries - overcooked and really just not that good.  The sauce was good, but cold.  Overall, my meal was not really that good.  My girlfriend got the special, which was veal hangar steak, shrimp riscotto and sauteed asparagus.  The veal was good, but the sauce just sucked in my opinion.  It had a liquorice flavor, and I don't dig on that.  The asparagus was the best part of the meal.  

We also got a bottle of french wine.  It was a merlot cab franc blend.  Like the meal, lackluster and I wish I ordered something cheaper, even though it was $36.  

Overall - the meal was OK, but I don't think I will go back.
