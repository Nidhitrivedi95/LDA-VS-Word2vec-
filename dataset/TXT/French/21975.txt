bRmb81XDG3E2SOHARBLTog WOW! That's all I have to say about this little gem of a place! A couple friends and I went here a few days ago and had an incredible time! This place was hopping with Christmas parties all around and the service still was amazing! The servers were all so attentive, despite being busy with all the other people in the place. The food was great. So well portioned and the taste was to die for! Such a great atmosphere, friendly service and great food. I will definitely be returning here and I highly recommend you give this place a try! :)
