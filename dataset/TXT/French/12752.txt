We got the cool and refreshing vichyssoise soup, the warm chicken and brie sandwich and the open-faced BLT plus the hand-cut potato chips and artichoke dipping sauce. So good. Sit on the patio for perfect views of the Bellagio fountains and a high quality, leisurely meal. Upscale, but not pretentious. Prices were comparable to a $$ restaurant in LA, but the quality and freshness of the meal was superb. We wanted to come back, but decided that in our short stay, we should try a few other restaurants - few could compare with Mon Ami Gabi, however. Definitely making a stop next time we're in town.
