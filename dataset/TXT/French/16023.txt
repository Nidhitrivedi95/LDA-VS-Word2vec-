78TC3sZSYBzBsSJ0z5pyhw It's a lovely restaurant with a pleasant atmosphere and a friendly staff. The selection seemed diverse enough. The reason for my lower rating is that I felt that the meal was unnecessarily heavy with lots of butter and oil. After the meal is when I experienced most of the regret. Now, maybe it was a result of my choices. (I didn't order any cream-base soup, I swear.) If so, it was still a surprise. Others in my party had the same day-after comments. 

I might try it again and be more careful, I'm not sure though.
