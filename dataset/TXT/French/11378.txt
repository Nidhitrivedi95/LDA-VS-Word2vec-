4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Soooo friggin' awesome! Mon Ami Gabi has a prime location on the Strip- right across from the Bellagio.. My hubby and I had brunch here last week and it was the perfect temperature to sit on the patio and people watch.  Our waitress was great- she let us take our sweet time and we didn't feel rushed at all... she explained the menu and specials and answered all of our crazy questions.... it was our last meal in Vegas before we headed to the airport, so of course we wanted to make sure it was a good one... and it was! I had the fried green tomatoes with fresh fruit, he ordered a sausage sandwich on one of their amazing fresh baguettes.  I also had a bloody mary which is easily  the best I had during our stay in Vegas... check it out, especially for breakfast or brunch.. you won't be disappointed!
