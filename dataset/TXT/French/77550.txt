YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g If I were to base this review on Las Vegas restaurants, it would get 4 stars.  But since I live in the greatest city in the world, it gets 3.  

We had an 8:30 reservation on a Saturday night.  The restaurant was not full, which gave me a little bit of a nervous feeling.  This was "the restaurant" at Mandalay bay.  

The food was ok, nothing to brag about, but nothing disgusting either.  The service was bad until they gave us some free deserts (so averages out to "A-ok").  

I had a great time because of the company, but next time I am in Vegas, not going to come here.
