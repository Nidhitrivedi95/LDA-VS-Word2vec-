rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Bouchon continues to be one of my favorite restaurants. It is quintessential French bistro and carefully walks the fine line between casual and fine dining. But to be certain, this is fine dining without snobbery. Plan to spend a couple of hours here, and the experience will be better. All ingredients are top of the line, fresh & well prepared. We started with the cold petite seafood platter. Fresh and top of the line shellfish.  The entrees were excellent.  Mussels were served in a cast iron pot with fries.  The steak was mouthwatering and was served with fries, The trout was prepared in an all clad pan and served that way with croutons that weren't to be believed. In all, outstanding.
