AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw Place is located almost towards the back and kind of difficult to find unless you are staying at Cesar's! We checked out both the Bistro and the Bakery. Bistro first. Went for our last breakfast there and it did no disappoint. I got the Madam and husband went for the Florentine breakfast. Both were great dishes. All fresh ingredients and cooked right there in the middle. Yes the chef is cooking right there in a round island with tables surrounding it. The decor is very french and classy. 
As for the bakery we tried the coconut sorbet (yummy!) and the peach pastry. Both were delicious, a definite stop for the Sweet tooth here!
