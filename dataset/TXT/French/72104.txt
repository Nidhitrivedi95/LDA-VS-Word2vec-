XKPosZx2j4RHcZ8Ewdwj0A Bah. I dunno. Expensive, 'OK' food, but SO overpriced.

I've probably just been in Vancouver too long where the options for dinner at a reasonable price (i.e., $50/person including wine) are numerous and delicious. Or maybe i'm just taking resto suggestions from the wrong people (read: people who make way more money than me). But i wasn't impressed with Lemeac. 

I guess if i'm giong to order an entree for $36 I expect a salad and dessert with it too! It just doesn't compute for me unless i'm ordering lobster or something. But it seems like this is the norm all over Montreal (or again, at the places people suggest to me). I know there are tons of great dives but I was hoping for a really awe inspiring "OMG food in Montreal is so much better than Vancouver" experience and on my last day, I have yet to experience. 

I guess I really am a Vancouverite...
