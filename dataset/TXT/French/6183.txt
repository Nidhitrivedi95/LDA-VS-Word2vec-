4cWrtMvfj-tomyEPgP7KFg Always a special experience at Melting Pot. The bf and I visited Easter Sunday for the special they were running. Sean was our waiter and he was awesome. I didn't catch the manager's name but they both were very accommodating to our special dietary requests. They made our meal personalized to our taste and because of that we will definitely be back very soon!
