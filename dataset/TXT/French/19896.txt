aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw Thomas Keller and Bouchon, you have my heart.

I'm still dreaming about the red velvet cupcake with the humongous filling on the top with the red sparkly glitter.  Bouchon makes Sprinkles cupcakes taste like recycled plastic brown bags.

Never though I would ever spend $75 on sweets but it was worth every cent.
