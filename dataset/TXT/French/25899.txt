Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA i had the grand tasting menu, one of my dining companions had the lower leveled tasting menu and another one of us just ordered regular appetizer and main course dishes. we all ended up sharing everything which gave a great tasting of everything. both tasting menus had hits and misses. the most memorable dishes of the night were the seared foie gras, cod, crab salad and lobster (in that order). we had a side of mac and cheese that was delish! and the floating island dessert was light and a very appropriate ending to a decadent meal. with the decor and the view.. the totality of this restaurant experience was greater than sum of its parts.
