An_U8woQkFVsMqVblkImZQ Ok place near university of Toronto campus.  We went to celebrate a birthday on Friday night.  We had reservations.   The service was the slowest I have ever experienced.  We took 3 hrs for dinner.   Started with Appetizers: Mushroom Soup which was very nice and flavorful, the Crab Cakes, Calamari and Special soup which was Shrimp with a corn base.   All were really nice, great flavors.  Started off well.

Then it took 1 hr to get the main course.   This course was ok.   We had the mushroom pasta (ok), chicken (ok), beef (good).   By the time the food showed up we were tired and maybe the bar had gone up by then.

The deserts of double chocolate art was fine, the creme brule was mediocore. 

You can do much better in Toronto.
