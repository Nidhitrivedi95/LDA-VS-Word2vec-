0JGMKaKJGVuDus5WcJzvjw My fiancé and I walked into Liverpool House and was quickly greeted by their staff. He was very friendly and pleasant. He took his time in explaining every single dish on their menu on the chalkboard. We ordered:

Homemade Lamb Sausage - It was the best lamb sausages we've ever had so far. It was flavourful and juicy.

Liverpool Steak (16oz) - a MUST order to share if you can't finish the whole 16oz. I had it medium rare and it was cooked perfectly and it melted in your mouth and well seasoned. It was so good that I finished the 16oz all by myself!

Lobster Spaghetti (1.5lb) - A generous portion of lobster with shells with al dente spaghetti. It had a nice cream sauce, but my fiancé wished it was less saucy, otherwise perfect.

I will definitely be back next time!!
