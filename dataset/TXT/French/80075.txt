zv92BYJH09YjFQOtSyYp-A Worst place I've been since my vacation to Montreal. Ordered a steak strip loin with fries, fries is so hard and the steak is so tiny and small!
My wife got a pasta with shrimp, its got no taste. The grilled chicken salad was so simple and bland. Not recommended, never coming here again.
