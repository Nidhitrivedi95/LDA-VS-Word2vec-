4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Loved Mon Ami Gabi! The view of the water show in front of the Bellagio was pretty great as well... Of course the company I had was the highlight of the dinner... But the food was delicious as well! I had the salmon and kale ceaser plate and wasn't disappointed! I also found the glass of Risling really great. Ask for patio seating... It's worth it. I will definitely be back!
