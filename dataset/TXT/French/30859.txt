fyJAqmweGm8VXnpU4CWGNw Love their cooked food and kind service. It's a great neighborhood restaurant. Very relaxed and low key. Best wines I've seen in downtown Phoenix with an emphasis on French and Italian, think Kermit Lynch and natural wine selections. Good price range for all budgets. Had a delicious bottle of growers sparkling wine yesterday on their recommendation for something happy and cheerful. Their tomato soup du jour was delicious. They also have a great selection of cheeses to go with their French bread. They have baguettes and batards baked fresh daily on the premises. In short, French Grocery has hit its stride and each time I visit I leave happy.
