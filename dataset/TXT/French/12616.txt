4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Kalani's Birthday weekend was coming to an end.  We shared our last meal in Vegas at Mon Ami Gabi.  Breakfast in Paris, lunch back home in Hawaii.  Why not?

We started at the "Make your own Bloody Mary Bar".  Funny how our outings usually begin and end at a bar, but I digress...   For 10 bucks you choose your vodka, they bring a generous pour in a tall glass and over to the "bar" you go.  There are mixers both spicy and mild, olives of all kinds, celery, beef sticks, pickled veggies, and horseradish to name a few options.  Don't like your drink, blame the bartender...

For breakfast we had Slow Roasted Beef Eggs Benedict, loved the creamy Hollandaise sauce over the braised short ribs.  Classic Quiche Lorraine with bacon cheese and onions.  Corned beef hash with poached eggs and a roasted red pepper sauce completed our meal,  We all enjoyed the entrees, but liked the Bloody Marys more.

All in all a good breakfast.  We arrived just in time and got to sit on the patio by the windows.  Pretty funny watching the stragglers from the night before head back to their hotels early in the morning...  The view was priceless and made us remember days gone by.  Au Revior, Mes Amis!...thanks for sharing your Birthday weekend, it was a blast!
