I ordered the Vegetarian Orecchiette which was just the right size and the taste was fabulous. The pasta was done perfectly as well. Definitely something I would order again.  Some of the other items we also ordered were the Lobster & Shrimp Frittata, Kabocha Squash Soup, Duck Hash & Eggs and the Smoked Salmon Benedict. The soup was a hit .. nice flavor and just the right amount of creaminess. The Benedict was the only thing that was not good. The slices of Salmon were too thick and the sauce was tasteless. 

The reason for the three stars is the service, ,or shall I say the "lack of service" our waiter was very prompt in taking our drink order (which consisted of mostly coffees and teas) and it took about 20 minutes for the order to be delivered. Once we had the drinks, no one offered or came by with refills. Our water glasses were empty by the time we got our food and were never refilled either.  I was perplexed by this as the reviews I had read have raved about the service .. but when the check came it became very clear to me. Tableau automatically adds the Gratuity to large parties. So I am guessing that the server knew he'd get a certain amount regardless of what type of service he gave. This is not acceptable especially since the menu is a bit on the pricey side and the restaurant is categorized on the Wynn website as "Fine Dining."
