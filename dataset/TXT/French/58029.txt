rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Walked to Bouchon from the TI over the pedestrian bridge through the casino, past the main lobby, down a long elegant hallway... arrived and was promptly seated. 

Party of four so we got a fair variety as we all ordered a different entree. 
The watercress and endive salad was very fresh and dressed well although Roquefort cheese was almost non existent. 
French onion soup was excellent, as was the freshly baked bread. 

Entrees: 
Steak frites pan seared perfectly and ubiquitous french fries were good but nothing special. 
Mussels were plentiful and accompanied by FF...the mussels were tasty but small. 
Braised pork shoulder was excellent and clearly the star in our opinion. 
Pan seared trout was also quite good. 

Dessert: carmel custard and creme brulet were excellent. 

Service was friendly and efficient
