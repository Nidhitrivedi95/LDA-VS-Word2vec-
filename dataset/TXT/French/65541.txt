U1LB3sRMGTu_h7Sf9QdNoA LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place. 

Having good food in one thing, but great service, amazing decor/presentation and great food is what sets this place apart from others.

Great service examples: 
1. Honest with wait times. Going the extra mile to ensure we get a table without giving us any false impressions that it would take 5 minutes when really it's an hour. 

2. Remembering our order since our first visit and always asks if we want our usual. Giving us a great sense of value in our experience.

3. Going beyond whats expected. We had no place to park our car, the staff no only suggested where to park but also guided us on how to get to the parking place with ease.

and the list goes on.......

If you are looking for something trendy with amazing atmosphere. This is the place.
