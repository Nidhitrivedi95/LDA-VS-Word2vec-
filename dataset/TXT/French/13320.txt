4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I very much enjoyed my experience at Mon Ami Gabi!

First off, I have to say it is one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas for ambiance alone. The indoor/ outdoor patio has monolithic glass windows adorned with radiant natural light. It is beautiful inside...The French bread is warm, authentic and brought immediately to the table... The restaurant is a bit over priced in my taste, but when you want a lovely place for lunch or brunch, it's worth the higher cost.  I very much enjoyed my French mussels and Belgian beer..  along with some delicious coffee to get the day going... : ) 

Great for special occasions or bringing your parents.  The indoor/outdoor patio also a nice view of the strip where you can watch all the tourists go by.
