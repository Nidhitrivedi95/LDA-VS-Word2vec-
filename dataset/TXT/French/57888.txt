rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A We decided to stop at Bouchon for breakfast before heading out on our tour of Hoover Dam. Overall a great experience.  Sit outside to enjoy the ambiance. We had the spiced beniet and they were awesome.  The sausage hash was real tasty. Service was great.  I don't give five star reviews liberally but for all intents and purposes this place is 5 stars. The cost is a bit steep but it is good quality so you get what you pay for.
