O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q Took advantage of the Restaurant Week special with a few buddies. Very nice upscale place on the strip located in the Palazzo. If you get a seat outside and you're lucky enough you can watch the Treasure Island show. Or if you're unlucky enough stay there during a show, all a matter of perspective.

So the meal which was priced at 50.12

Onion Soup Gratinee
 - Overall this was the best fancy named french onion soup i've had. It was rich and...soupy...it was good. Normally i don't order french onion soup or onion soup but this was good. 

Baby Iceberg Lettuce
 - Pretty much a wedge salad with three wedges. Bacon cuts were nice and thick and wonderfully smoked but the blue cheese dressing was way too rich and plentiful.

Mediterranean Branzino
 - I did enjoy the sides the came with this Mediterranean SEABASS but for the fish itself...yeah i forgot what seabass tasted like. Way too buttery as well.

Profiteroles 
 - enough with the fancy names...These are little puff pastries filled with vanilla ice cream and includes chocolate sauce. At this point of the dinner all of us were way too stuffed to even consider dessert but it came out anyway. I enjoyed the ice cream more then the pastry due to my need to live to eat another day.


Morels relies on the older French ideology of cooking which heavily relies on rich and heavy sauces to enhance food. Totally different and may be a bit heavy on you if you're more used to lighter aromatic dishes of today's modern dining experiences.
