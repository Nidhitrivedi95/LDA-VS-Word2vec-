EPb3FWs3mxQLUjGeMNP0SQ Had a HORRIBLE experience at this restaurant, it felt like a body shop.

We came in  at 8 on sat and the hostess found us a table. We ordered and food was not good, my friend ordered stead rare and she got it well done... and when she tried to change it the waiter was arguing with her that it was rare... as if we dont know what rare is... 
Then at 10:pm we were drinking our coffee and the hostess comes up to us to tell us that we have to leave because the table was reserved !
she "claimed" first that she had told us when she seated us which is untrue, so she was arguing that and that was a lie, they probably got new customers and wanted to get them a table asap and she wanted us out, and to top it she was rude and the manager was even worse than her. we were treated so badly and definitely I would rather put my money in so many great restaurants in town.,..

In conclusion, do your self a favour, and DO NOT GO TO THIS RESTAURANT. If I can Rate it 0 on this site I would.
