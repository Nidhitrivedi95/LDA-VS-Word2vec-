5fquJHY2hMX9tPRD5s0t5g My daughter and I were visiting UNC Charlotte and had dinner here last night. The food was delicious. BEST short ribs ever!! The meal was amazing as was the service. We were looking for suggestions to shop after and the staff were so helpful. The manager is superb!! I wish they had this restaraunt in Boston!
