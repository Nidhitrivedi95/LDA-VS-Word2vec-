XZ7eQLjyGXf6y69UT4SGhg I'll preface this with the detail that I didn't realize it was 10min before they open and this is rating is solely based on owners attitude to his employees. The pastries looked like art and decadent to be honest. 

I came in and the employee said I would need to wait 10 min for the missing items which was fine I just walked in early. The owner gave a confused and irritated look to the super sweet counter employee. Then the owner stood up straight while puffing up his chest and said "he's just an employee" (like a pompous jerky to make his employee feel small) "I'm the owner you can order anything you want". It made me upset for the employee, I was embarrassed for this poor kid. The owner deserved a karate chop to the neck it was in such bad taste. 

I made my order the super nice kid went to back to retrieve the items from the back and the tough guy owner comes out saying it's not ready. I couldn't hold back and said "but you're the owner you just said I can order anything and this nice employee was wrong, you're the owner right, you don't know." I continued to explain how the way he spoke to his employee was terrible and he shouldn't treat people that way. I also told him to give his employees wind beneath their wings and loving nudges instead. Then I left, I couldn't give him any money. Poor kid has to deal with random people all day he doesn't need to be belittled too. Upsets me when ownership treats their employees like that. Didn't see a tip jar for the kid either, maybe just on cash register.
