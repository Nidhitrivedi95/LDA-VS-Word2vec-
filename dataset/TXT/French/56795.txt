rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A French baking techniques at their best! We had the blueberry croissant - a must do! the flakiest croissant, cut in half, filled with almond cream, perfectly braised blueberries, and topped with struesel! The complimentary baguette has got to be one of the best I have ever had, perfectly crusty, without being hard. It was the little touches that made it even better, lightly salted fruit cup, perfect mimosa... 

The omelette was so, so - but that could be because I am not a huge fan of the French style omelettes.  

The service at the front desk lacks the Keller standard, but the wait staff is attentive, and more than makes up for the lack of warmth at the reception. 

Can't wait to go back, and try all the other delicious items on the menu!
