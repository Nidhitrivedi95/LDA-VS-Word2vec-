rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A My wife and I had finished watching O and were trying to decide where to dine. Le Cirque and Picasso had ample availability but, ugh, who wants to sit imprisoned there for hours? Instead, we decided on Bouchon - meaning the next challenge was getting there on foot. A helpful valet at the Bellagio said it was a 15 minute walk - which was really wrong. From the Bellagio, the Venetian looks very close - I mean, it's right there; there's the sign. It's right there!  No. It's not. 

It feels a little like walking through enemy territory getting there. At one point, we were in front of a small group of drunk young men, one of whom said he wanted to crush his beer bottle over someone's head. Vegas baby!

I thought that once we got to the Venetian, we'd be there - but even then no! That place is big. 

We arrived at 9:50 but were graciously seated at a lovely table outside. Not quite as bucolic as the Yountville location, but still quite pleasant. 

The food, as in the Napa Valley flagship, is awesome and simple. It's impressive to see TK's high standards are met so capably by the staff here. 

The frisee salad with soft poached egg and lardons is excellent and the poulet rotis was perfectly done. 

Great location, great ambience, great food. The perfect bistro!

As for the Belgians at the next table eating pommes frites with mayonnaise - c'mon man, just gross.
