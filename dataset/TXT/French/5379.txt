The building is three stories tall, with garage door style windows looking out on the walking street, which will be fabulous in the summer. The first floors are for dining and the top is for events like art shows or music nights, with a bar at the half level. The atmosphere is welcoming and intimate. The food is excellent. We brought our 13 year old daughter and we shared French Onion soup that was milder than I am used to, which is now my favorite. We tried Salmon, lamb, and steak tartare, and all were prepared perfectly. Ben and his girl, as he describes her, are sweet and very personable and certainly enhance the dining experience. We look forward to coming back next time we are in Montreal. Price is reasonable and creme brûlée was perfect.
