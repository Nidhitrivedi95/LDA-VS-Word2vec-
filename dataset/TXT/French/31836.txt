For the meals - not so much. 

I ordered the roasted lamb and was disappointed that is was not seasoned enough. After two bites, I pushed away my meal and sampled my friend's orders. It takes a very dull meal to stop me from at least attempting to eat it.

From what I tasted, one out of the four orders was appetizing.

Now on to the cakes. The cakes were very good. I would almost wish this restaurant specialized in cakes and desserts. That or bring up the standard of the meal to that of the cakes.
