1ThbwFVBL9YA2oOM11iO7g What a lovely place to spend a Friday evening.  The service was impeccable, and we were a group of 12, most of us from NYC so with very high standards when it comes to restaurants!  We had an amazing time with wonderful food and wine.  The highlights included the duck confit, charcuterrie, pork belly and of course the donuts!  Will definitely be back for brunch one day.
