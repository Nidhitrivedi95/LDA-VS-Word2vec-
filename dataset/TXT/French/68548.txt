vLkKorA1gPS97Zj0_WKA0Q The restaurant is beautiful and has a great view of the strip.  The vibe is laid back but still a good time.

The food however was hit and miss.  It feels like the chef is still trying to figure some things out but I appreciate the attempt at some interesting and unique food choices.
