SBnpT6JDbah-5l_52GM5sw Beautiful location overlooking the snow covered lake. My party was lucky enough to be sat near the patio, with the sun shining in. 

My party started with these chocolate/walnut pasties that honestly were out of this world. I'm not the biggest chocolate fan, but this dark chocolate was not overly sweet nor bland. Perfect.
I ended up ordering the House Burger with frites on recommendation from a friend who frequents quite a bit and it was fantastic and presented beautifully. Definitely a large helping of burger, frites and a side salad.

The waiter was quite attentive, and extremely patient in regards to our late party guest. Did not make us feel rushed or guilty, and always came to check in with a smile. 

Great service, food, atmosphere, and location. Just be sure to reserve a table, I've been told, especially for Sunday brunch.
