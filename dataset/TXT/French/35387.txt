htQgj-ANQpZGpIpkkrEmyQ TLDR: Great food, great service and clean. 

So good. Such generous portions. Shared both of these dishes and couldn't finish. Servers were nice (but very busy). 

INSP Burger 
- such a good burger, I think there's cheese in the actual meet 
- no ketchup and IT WORKS 
- fries that came with (regular fries) were so delicious: seasoned well, no ketchup and it WORKS 

Waffles + Chicken 
- Just delicious 
- wish there was a layer of the mango edamame in between the waffles 
- wish there were a few more berries I had one blueberry and one raspberry 

Overall, it was amazing. The flavour profiles of both dishes were so different, a little strange, but worked very well. Enjoyed thoroughly. The place is clean and intimate. Servers are great. Different waiters were helping our table, not just one. And they packed our leftovers (there was about ~35-40% left).
