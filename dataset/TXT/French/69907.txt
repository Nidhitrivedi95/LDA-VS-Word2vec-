WOj8nPos3R9IIf0Pyttd8g Our server was great!  She even fixed our wobbly table, so this review does not apply to her.  We were there for brunch, so this also doesn't apply to dinner.

But the slices of pork fat were as far from "bacon" as anything I've ever seen in my 36 years walking this planet.  We were there on a Sunday at noon and it wasn't crowded at all.  However, a line quickly formed behind us and once they got behind, they never found their groove again.  For such an upscale appearance, they are completely unprepared for a brunch rush and the chef is still figuring out how to cook breakfast dishes.  Won't be going back in the near future, at least not for breakfast.
