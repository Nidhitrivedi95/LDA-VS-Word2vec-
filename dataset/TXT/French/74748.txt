xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g I'm giving this a rating based on what my expectations are!  
Haven't had the pleasure of visiting "Eiffel Tower" restaurant....YET.....but after reading all of the yelp reviews as well as other online recommendations, my hubby and I are excited to visit it next month to celebrate our 30th Wedding Anniversary!  Unfortunately, we've already got dinner reservations already confirmed elsewhere, BUT will be going there for after dinner cocktails and delicious desserts in the bar/lounge area! Can't wait to post pictures and a fabulous review....of our anniversary evening out at the "Eiffel Tower"! :)
