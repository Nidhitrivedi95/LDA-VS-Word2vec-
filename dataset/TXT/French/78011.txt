YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g This is a very romantic restaurant. I had a great time dining here. The food was great and my server was very attentive. The maitre d came by and greet us as well. I felt very welcome here and this is one of the restaurants in Vegas that I highly recommend to go to. Get the chocolate souffle, which has to be ordered in the beginning of the meal because it takes a while to make.
