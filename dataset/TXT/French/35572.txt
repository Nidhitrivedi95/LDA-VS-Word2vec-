Cleanliness/Atmosphere: 4/5
Service: 4.5/5
Innovation: 5/5
Overall: 4.3 

Value: There's not much to be said of value. The price range is fair, but it's not cheap nor expensive. The servings sizes are fair but not large nor small. There aren't a lot of special deals available.

Quality of Food: The most impressive thing about Inspire is the dishes the chefs have created. The INSP burger, the Chicken & Waffle, and the pulled pork Frite just to name a few, have left a big impression on me. 

Cleanliness/Atmosphere: Despite being small, the dining experience rarely feels crowded, but borders cozy. The place is very clean and well lit. Decorations are modern. A flat screen TV hangs above the bar showing loops of a fireplace. It is a pleasant experience. 

Service: Service here is excellent. Waiters and waitresses are flexible to seating requests. Despite not having reservations one time, the waitress was very accommodating and offered us alternatives to simply waiting. 

Innovation: Being a fusion restaurant, innovation is a huge factor. In the case of Inspire Restaurant, it is a huge positive factor. What i'm most impressed by their dishes is always the simplicity. The idea behind fusion food is of course, the combination of two worlds. The purpose is to create new from the old. This means at least double the possibilities. Yet in the mist of all those choices, Inspire manages to keep things simple, and easy to appreciate, all the while demonstrating utmost creativity.
