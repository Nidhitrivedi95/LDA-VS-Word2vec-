2B46bRpDh49eDyjXGhL_ZQ My boyfriend is French and he drags me to every French restaurant in town.  We come here quite often! Authentic french crepes made by a warm and friendly French woman in a quaint cafe that transports you to France. Maggie is always so welcoming and treats us like family. What more could we ask for?  I usually get a savory crepe, which is made with buckwheat flour, and he usually gets a sweet one that I always steal a bite of :)
