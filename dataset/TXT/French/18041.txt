A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g Oh my God! The french macaroons are AMAZING!!! And, everything else is too!!! I have never had something from here that I didn't LOVE! It's a little pricey, BUT you get a very high quality pastry and a large portion size. My husband and I usually split one pastry and are amply filled. I love the huge selection of melt in your mouth macaroons. Every one of them is unique and you can tell they are made with a lot of thought and passion! I hope they never close and maintain the quality. On a side note, when my husband and I wanted to order a wedding cake we could not get an appointment between our busy schedule and their busy schedule. We ended up going with another bakery down the road. I still wonder how much better our wedding cake may have been if it came from here. Other than that I love this place!
