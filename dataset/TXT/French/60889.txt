SD7vTf-H00J8BS3L-kt7jg amazing ambience, we had a great time, the DJ and music was fabulous and the people well are dressed nicely. Its a place youd wanna go on saturday night and hangout for drinks and food. The only issue is there is not a lot of choices on the menu for someone who is not a meat lover. Also not everyhting on their menu was good. Ive had some really good stuff and some others that were not good at all.

The service was nice too and the valet parking was very good to have, though we did wait a while to get the car in the end so i prefer to find parking and have my car handy when i leave.
