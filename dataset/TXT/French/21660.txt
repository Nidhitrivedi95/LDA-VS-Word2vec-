bEVWHtBRYVwqaaNF4mWNYg Coquine never disappoints!!  It's a neighbourhood gem that has a fairly large group of regulars who have all become friendly with each other because the tables are set up pretty close together.  This, however, creates the best atmosphere you could imagine!! It's fancy but not pretentious.  It's a place you can always go to, even alone, and see people you know!!  The crowd his hip and fun and reflects Robbie, the owner and master of creating an ambiance and experience that is full of great energy and great times that you will never forget.  Epic!!  I have eaten there regularly since he opened and they are always spot on or are quick to overcompensate for any mistake made (They are human after all). It bothers me to read negative reviews because there is not an employee that works there that won't bend over to please you with your food or drink.  Please don't say your fine if your not and then complain on YELP!  Finally, the white bean dip that they serve as a gift to their customers is more than just bread and dip!  It's hearty and generous and delicious, as is everything they serve.  Robbie and his staff create a laid back atmosphere in very chic surroundings, fantastic cuisine and it's always s good time! If you are looking for a quiet night for a romantic dinner you might not want to come here but I would suggest calling them to ask to the staff which night isn't as busy because there is no place in the city that will do as much to please you, as this place will.  Robbie, thanks for being you and doing what you do.  You ROCK!!!   P.S. I have to say it... We miss Adam. Thursday nights are not the same.  Please try and get him back.  Thank you.
