rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Awesome brunch. I have been here in the past for dinner and was not impressed, but brunch time... whoa! hola! 

My favorite dish was the Chicken and waffles - roasted chicken, bacon and chive waffle,Tahitian vanilla bean butter, sauce chasseur. This wasn't even my dish and I kept reaching over to steal a bite. The chicken is sooo flavorful and tender. 

I ordered the Special which was scrambled eggs with wild shrimp, spinach, hollandaise sauce and brioche toast. Delish! the sauce was amazing and worked so well with the sweet little shrimps. 

Probably the best meal I had this vegas trip. 
I want more chicken and waffles!!! :P
