Ordered the escargot which was perfect combination of garlic and pesto once I ate the actual escargot my family dipped the fresh baggett into the leftovers. The lemon salmon was perfectly cooked and the combination of peas and sweet potato was absolutely amazing! Tag was nice and I would recommend to anyone heading over to the strip. Good food for reasonable price.
