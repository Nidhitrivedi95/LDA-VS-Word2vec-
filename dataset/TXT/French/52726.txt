qbC4cfz-ShxEGpLS94Mk7Q I think they are trying a bit too hard to be French. It's all well and fine, but I did not feel utterly comfortable there, mostly rushed. I ordered a bavette, in lieu of a steak-frites, which was not so well cooked and the fries were luke-warm. They have an excellent wine selection and if you reserve in advance you can get the nicer tables inside the restaurant (I was literally at the door). If you research French, I would recommend 'Le Select' on Wellington, they are the real thing.
