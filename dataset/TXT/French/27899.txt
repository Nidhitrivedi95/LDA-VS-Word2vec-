dW9cPsvOGwlOpiz3wEBgiQ Bernard's Bistro is a wonderfully upscale yet relaxed eatery offering traditional French cuisine in a classy atmosphere that tastefully pays homage to its Titanic history and Las Vegas legend Frank Sinatra. This is perfect for locals and conservatively inclined tourists looking for a quiet evening, with service that rivals and outpaces many venues on the Boulevard. Order the savory escargot, or the surprisingly hearty vegetarian dish to experience some French favorites. Though business casual attire is appropriate, gentlemen may find themselves more comfortable in jackets.
