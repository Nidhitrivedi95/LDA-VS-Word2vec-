The lady who helped us wasn't friendly and doesn't seem like she really wanted to be there.  It almost feel depressing in here.  We came here for some lattes after our dinner down the street.  They were super delicious.  I ordered a regular French Vanilla Latte and my husband got the regular White Chocolate Latte.  Both were great choices.  The French Vanilla is less sweet than the White Chocolate if you don't want something too sweet.  

We'll have to came by during the daytime to see if it's a lively environment.
