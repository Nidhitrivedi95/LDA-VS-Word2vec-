If you want a delicious, carefully prepared, tasty, well-priced brunch/breakfast, served by genuinely friendly, caring staff, this is the place for you. It's ambiance is a mix of charming and quirky. While it has massive ornament balls the size of two heads dangling from a portion of the ceiling, the eccentricity is contrasted with interesting, stylish art hung on the walls. In short, the atmosphere has character. It's cute, it's zany, and yet it's humble. And it knows good food.

We arrived on a Saturday morning for brunch at 9:30 AM. We parked right on the Lakeshore, right across the restaurant, where parking was $1.00 an hour. The restaurant was moderately full when we arrived, but we were cheerfully greeted and given our choice of the remaining tables. Our server was so friendly, so warm, keeping an attentive eye on us.

We ordered: a) the Huevos Rancheros, b) the Mexican Benedict, and c) Mexican brewed coffee in medium roast. Can I just say that their guacamole is made of magic? It's deep, fully of body, and a slice of heaven when slathered on the crunchy baguettes served with the Huevos Rancheros. I normally scarf down my food when I'm hungry, but I savoured each bite of the Mexican Benedict. It was perfectly cooked, with a nice kick, with the perfect amount of sauce. Hats off to the chef. Delicious.

For two people, with tax and tip, our total came to approximately $37.00. We will definitely be back.
