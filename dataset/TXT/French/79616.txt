zqNgwQjj0_XAll-neGikIw We were in Paris last spring so we thought a meal at Merci would bring back fond memories. It was a disappointment. My husband ordered the French Onion Soup. It was served lukewarm and it did not have the rich, depth of flavor one expects from onion soup. I ordered the Quiche Lorraine. It too was served lukewarm and tasted like it was made with very little cheese and little or no cream. I also ordered the French Hot Chocolate which turned out to be the biggest disappointment of all. Good French Hot Chocolate is so rich and thick you think you're sipping a melted Hershey's bar. Merci's was not much better than a packet of dry cocoa mix with whipped cream on top. If you're looking for an authentic French meal Merci is not the place to go.
