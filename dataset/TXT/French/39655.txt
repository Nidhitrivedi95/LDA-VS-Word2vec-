JxtwVeuCBX99KEciymlYXA I give it four stars because the potatoes werent crispy. I ordered the blt, which was open faced, a fried egg, smoked bacon, cheese, arugala and tomatoe. I got freshly squeezed orange juice small, but small was like a tall shot glass. A little smaller then I expected. Very tastey. My date got the english breakfast and loved the sausage and blood pudding. He gives it 5 stars hands down, but its my review and I stick to my guns! :-P
