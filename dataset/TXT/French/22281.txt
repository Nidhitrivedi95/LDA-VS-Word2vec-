BSmqxPbQglQwP2R56OqOag It has been a bit over a year since I have Yelped this place...and happy to report that things are still wonderfully consistent and a delight. Our wedding anniversary is this week and we invited some dear friends to join us at Local last night to help us begin the early celebration, The service and food, once again, was stellar!  Matthew was our server and he was excellent...helpful but not gratuitous..nearby but not hovering. The calamari and drunken bread apps were wonderful..and new (to us) burrata app with fig was veryy tasty! Peg loved the duck risotto, and my pork tenderloin (polenta, brussel sprouts) Our guests had the lasagna and pork spare ribs...both incredibly tasty. I think I have sung the praises of the tiramisu before..but OMG...it is worth the carb count.  In  the midst of the craziness of a Saturday evening, two flutes of champagne arrived in the spirit of the occasion. The attention to detail is always very impressive here. So...if you have an opening for a place that will give you a great experience....I would encourage you to go Local!  Dr. B
