9mG2yOnHtxVPEM1p8FqycA As others say, this is a good place for brunch.  You can't have your omelet in 10 different ways, but you can get some good pastries -- my favorite, the almond croissant -- and hot cocoa, coffee and good oj.  The quiche is good, the sandwiches are fine, but I usually get the "special bonjour", which has a croissant filled with egg, ham and cheese, served with fruit on the side.  It is decent.

I think I love the place because of the cozy atmosphere inside -- most like a french bistro than a typical brunch place.  And their patio in the summer is excellent.  A must try, and if you are in the neighborhood, definitely grab a croissant at the bar.
