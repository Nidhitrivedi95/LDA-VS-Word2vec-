4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Ahhh Mon Ami Gabi. I'm a local and I enjoy going here. Add this to my list of awesome patios. 

The food is great. Although most of the menu may be too fancy for some people's taste, there is steak so anyone could eat here. 

The patio is gorgeous. Right across Las Vegas Blvd from the Bellagio fountains, and lots of people to watch, being dead center on the strip. 

We had: 

Macaroni Gratin: I think I just died and went to heaven. Don't let the fancy shmanchy name disguise fool you. This is Mac & cheese, but better than most out there. It's just classic noodles and cheese, but the crispy melted cheese on top and the mini shells really take this one to the next level. I consider myself a Mac & cheese connoisseur, and this is an 8/10 on my Mac & cheese scale. 

Garlic Spinach: pretty good! I am a sucker for veggi side dishes so this one was decent. The garlic really showed up in the spinach even though sautéed spinach can overpower a lot of flavors. Delish! 

22 oz Rib-eye with herb butter and béarnaise sauce: I'm not a huge meat person, but my husband so is and he loved this. The ribeye is his favorite cut of meat and this one had so much flavor packed in. Not just char and meat flavor. There was a lot of depth. Texture wasn't bad either. And the frites are fantastic here. Crispy and soft. 

This place is a must if you are visiting or just looking to see the strip for the first time in a long time of living here.
