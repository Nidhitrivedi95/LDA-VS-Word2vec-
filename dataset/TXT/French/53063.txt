QeFsIMcIFIJcOrpthYL8jg Had a wonderful dinner here while on a work trip.  Was able to get a reservation online before flying in, which is very convenient.  I was staying in Old Montreal and was very pleased that this place was around the corner.  The ambiance is nice and live music is always great with dinner.  The food was good and affordable for the area.  I got the catch of the day, it was simply but hit the spot.  Also the staff is very friendly!
