xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g First review ever, had to review the tower restaurant as i was very disappointed in the food. The view is amazing and the greeters are awesome, but our waitress was not able to explain the menu which was hard to decide since its in french.complimentary bread is good. Ordered the farm raised chicken, and was expecting the breast but was disappointed that i got the thigh. I thought it was gross. Immediately lost appetite bagged up the food and gave to street artist. Also waitress just did not seem interested in giving us an experience. Overpriced flavors that dont compliment vegas experience
