JEXasd9XUHFbt_fIdmdK8g Again, any restaurant of this level is bound to have a whole lot of haters. I've been reading everywhere of these haters, bringing forth nonesense discussions about portion sizes, simplicity, etc. 
We were here for a birthday celebration and it was the first alone time we had since we had a baby 15 months prior to the visit. The expectations were high, we were tense and ready to have our night go to waste with an emergency call. 
Let me get to the point; none of these happened. We sat down, beautifully greeted. Place filled up completely in about 20 minutes. Service is incredible, the servers (I believe we have to call them associates or something) are so knowledgeable, you'd feel they cooked up the recipe. I could write a bunch more about their love for the food, but I'll stop here.
The food is amazing, don't listen to the haters, the simplicity is KEY. The flavours are so well paired that I, with all my rudeness, took a small piece of bread and WIPED my plate clean! I feel no shame. 
DO have that ridicilous ziggy stardust chocolate piece, who cares about the dollar value in the menu, you are NOT on a budget tonight, if you decided to come here, enjoy the experience.
One of the best nights of my life, with the beautiful person I fell in love with so many years ago, in a great atmosphere.
You will NOT be disappointed!
