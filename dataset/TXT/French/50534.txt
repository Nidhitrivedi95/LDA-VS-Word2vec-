OYHpqY6-3C-wXR-uPbHhwA This place is nothing but a joke, whoever envisioned this restaurant to become a successful story needs to re-evaluate their product, their management, and the voice and opinions of their clients! Disappointing customer service, tasteless food, and their staff in the kitchen?? How desperate are you guys?? To hire people without experience, without passion without hard core values? Las Vegas is known for amazing eateries, this place runs solely on that 1 cashier, who tries her best, and sympathizes with customers when they are upset. This cashier takes the beatings while the rest of the staff hides out!
