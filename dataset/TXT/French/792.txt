_cjPEH9wXhKS-HQe_U3M4Q Everyone knows by now, I love French food. And this place is terrifically French. Very classic and traditional French food cooked well. Quite a large menu with daily specials and a wine list to die for - the wine "list" is novel sized and daunting but their house selection is perfect as well - I suggest the Rhone for Red. But their staff is very knowledgeable if you're looking for something extra special.

I've had a quite a few dishes here - which being a vegetarian at a French restaurant can be a nice surprise - their frites are AMAZING, perfectly salted and come to the table nice and hot. The omelet with brie cheese and potato rosti is a perfect brunch meal as is the quiche. The salads are lovely and a nice size and the desserts rich and sweet as they should be! Coffee comes served with a beautiful piece of chocolate - every part of your experience here feels controlled and catered to in all the right ways.

They make a delicious martini! And I'm assured by my friends, bf and colleagues that the meat dishes are spectacular as well. They take care with their ingredients, where they come from and how they are raised which always wins me over. Its on the higher end of pricing for restaurants of a similar ilk but I think it's totally worth it.

Perfect for business, pleasure, romance, family dining, this place has it all. Cozy romantic tables and booths, larger flat tops for business, including a back room worthy of a good sized party, a lovely patio out front that is nicely decorated by some bushes so you feel away from the somewhat industrial nature of Wellington. Everything I love about French decor and ambience is here.
