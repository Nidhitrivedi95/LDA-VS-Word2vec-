ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug My boyfriend and I have visited Le Café Ile Saint Louis 3 times during our recent trip to Vegas. Twice when we were actually staying at Paris, and once this past trip. The service has been excellent two out of the three times, and the food has been excellent all 3. 

We have ordered:
*Steak au Poivre (peppered steak) and the pom frites with asparagus (we LOVED this)
*The 3 course meal with French onion soup, filet migon, mac and cheese, mashed potatoes and cheesecake.
*Chicken fingers 
*French Onion Soup al la carte. 

We have also ordered lattés at their side bar while not dining at the restaurant several times. 

The ambiance is fun, as it looks like a French café, and if you sit outside there is plenty of opportunity for people watching. As I said, the service was great two out of the three times. Once the waitress just seemed a bit clueless, but the food was still good. 

I recommend this place to anyone looking for a middle of the road priced place with pretty decent food and a fun, sorta romantic atmosphere.
