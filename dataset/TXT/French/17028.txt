9ET_RUNztevq4_OLAX80Gg Went for winterlicious 2017. Food is delicious and the service is really nice! I had the terrine for starter, the pickles with them are super tasty, they went really well with the ham and the terrine. My boyfriend had the smoked salmon which I had a little bite. It's slightly too salty, but went well with the salad. The sea bream is full of flavor and really fresh. The skin is super crispy when the dish is hot! The veggies are also tasty too but a little bit oily. The chocolate charlotte is okay because the lady finger is way too sweet for me. The server is helpful with my choice of dishes and wine.
Overall, atmosphere 4/5, food 3.5/5, service 4/5. The steak for two on the regular menu seems really amazing. We might come someday and try it out!
