Yp9w4nhUowBU_IS_StFXbQ The 110 degree heat in Vegas is the only thing that can make me lose my appetite, but luckily the dungeness crab club at lunch was there to rescue me. It also encouraged me to return for dinner the following night, which was one of the best meals I have ever enjoyed. I had the dungeness crab ravioli with lemon emulsion - sense a theme here? It was a perfectly balanced dish - the creaminess was tempered by the citrus and was by far the best dish we had that night. My second was a duck breast wrapped in bacon. And anyone who knows me will tell you that if you wrap something in bacon I will eat it and be thrilled. So don't follow the Vegas hype to the trendier restaurants. At Tableau the decor is beautiful (my purse enjoyed its own private divan), and the service was spectacular and un-fussy. Tableau feels like an extension of someone's home, only with much better food.
