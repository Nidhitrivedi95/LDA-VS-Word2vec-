The fruit bouquet had fruit that was ripe, so I not disappointed, which can happen with fruit. The crepe "the skinny pancake" with apricot, the special for today was just the right amount of sweet. I normally don't like a crispy bacon, but I enjoyed the thick cut of bacon. The musicians close by playing guitar very well and the fountains across the street just made the meal. The servers were attentive too. Underneath the heater we had a great breakfast experience. I will be back.
