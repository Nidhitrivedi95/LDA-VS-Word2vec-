9ET_RUNztevq4_OLAX80Gg Came here for saturday lunch and ordered off of the 3-course summerlicious menu.

1st came the poached salmon and escargot. The salmon was amazing! I had never had salmon this tender before. Don't try to order the escargot - it tasted elastic-hy and really tough. And also has lots of gritty sand particles in there. 

Complained to the staff about the snails but they were quite nice about it and so our service became a lot more attentive.

Then came the mackerel and chicken. mackerel tasted a bit bland for me - since i'm more used to them being eaten the jap/korean way. chicken sous vide was fantastic though. Never had I encountered such perfectly cooked and tender chicken before! It was moist and juicy :) Enveloped in veloute sauce, which was just perfectly done

Dessert - chocolate/raspberry and strawberry/ice cream. I'm totally biased here because I love dessert. but trying hard to be fair, this was really really good. Coming from a picky eater, this must really mean something! Ice cream had a bit tartness to it - felt completely house made! Not a big fan of raspberry but for some reason chocolate with raspberry combo in this case just felt so right

Overall, great food - in terms of artistic presentation, and balance of taste/texture, good service = happy me.
Would definitely come here again, summerlicious or not. :)
