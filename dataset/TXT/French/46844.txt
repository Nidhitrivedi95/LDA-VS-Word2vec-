nkHaix6KenApS8M-liZsCQ Came here with the Better Half to celebrate her Birthday.  The restaurant came highly recommended by a friend, and we noticed that they had Foie Gras on the menu (her fave) so we decided to check it out.  

We reviewed the menu before we got to the restaurant and decided to order:

Roasted Foie Gras Prepared Sous Vide - $110 
Smoked Truffle-Infused Filet Mignon - $38

For sides - $8 each:

Mac n' Cheese au Gratin w/ Ham
Gnocchi
Potatoes Au Gratin

The server took the order and came back a few minutes later to tell us that they're out of Foie Gras.  We were extremely disappointed and surprised....especially since there were 3 items on the menu that had Foie Gras as the main ingredient and the place wasn't packed.  

In an attempt to save the day, the server checked with the kitchen and came back and said there was a small piece of Foie Gras left for the Appetizer but that he could prepare it like the entree.  Since we came all the way down here for the dish, we agreed.

While we were waiting for our dinner, our Bread and Water was never refilled and we had to pour our own Wine.  For a restaurant like this, we didn't expect that kind of service.

The food arrived...the Filet was decent, but not great.  Not as tender as I usually like it.  The highlight was the Gnocchi.  The Better Half said her Foie Gras tasted a little funny.  She didn't finish her serving.

Overall, the experience was sub-par.  The server's attempt to save the day kept us from giving this place 1 Star.
