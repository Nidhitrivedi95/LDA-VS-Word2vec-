9ETbjlbD52Q6PKXjIcTqUA For the Preamble I decided to give this place a second chance because I know some people that patronized this restaurant and really enjoyed it. Everyone deserves a second chance.  I went here with my wife and our friend Billie Sue.

I would like to acknowledge the service here. We walked in without a reservation and was seated immediately because we went there midday so there was no crowd. After being seated our waitress Vanessa took our beverage order and gave us ample time to review the menu and select our entrees. 

We started our meal off with an appetizer of Calamari Provencal - made with fresh Herbs, diced Tomato, tossed in Lemon Butter. The lemon butter sauce stole the show here. I would have totally licked my plate to get every last drop it was so good. My wife loved it and like me commented how delicious the lemon butter sauce was. Our friend Billie Sue never tried calamari and was apprehensive about tasting it. One bite and she was hooked. 

Next up my wife and I got a dinner salad. It had a Balsamic Hazelnut Vinaigrette that was amazing delicious. For our entrees our friend ordered tilapia - Sautéed Tilapia, Flour Dusted, Smashed Red Potatoes, Carrots, Asparagus, in Lemon Beurre Blanc. She really enjoyed it and offered my wife a bite to try it. My wife told Bilie Sue she didn't like tilapia but Billie Sue insisted she try it. Guess what my wife thought it was remarkably tasty.

For our entrees my wife and I ordered the halibut. This dish was truly the highlight of the of our visit. The halibut was beautifully served in addition to being moist and tender. "Magnifique" !!

We finished off our meals with dessert. Billie Sue decided on the Tiramisu Carol and I ordered the Carmel Cheesecake. I normally don't order desserts or sweets, but the cheese cake was calling my name. It was divine. words cannot describe how stupendous this dessert is. 

FOOD:  Was super scrumptious. The flavors and texture combined perfectly without overwhelming any of the fish dishes.  The portions look small, but they aren't that small as you dig in. We all left the restaurant very satisfied and full. The food is fantastic, everything we ordered was tasty and exceeded our expectations. AMBIANCE: Rustic atmosphere. If you have people visiting from out of town, you should take them here. Its a unique experience that everyone should know about! PRICE: The prices are real reasonable for French food. The bill for the three of us came to $133.42. SERVICE: I cannot emphasize enough the wonderful service experience we got from Vanessa. The service here is top notch and extremely attentive. Vanessa was polite, professional, and courteous. CONCLUSION: If the way to that special someone's heart is through their stomach, take them to Café Provence and they'll fall madly in love with you. This snug, lovely restaurant offers an intimate alternative to the rest of the restaurants we normally frequent.  Perfect unpretentious French restaurant that offers excellent service and affordable prices. Café Provence s definitely deserves the high praise. I will be most certainly coming back, hungry and yearning for more! RETURN FACTOR: 100%
