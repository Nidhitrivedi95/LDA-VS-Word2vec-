AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw Even better than the now-shuttered :( NYC location.  Hands down the best French toast I've ever had---custardy vanilla brioche goodness perfectly accompanied by a delicious fresh berry reduction---head and shoulders above Bouchon's.  The quiche was also very good but I'm going back for the French toast.  And the truffles.  And maybe a few croissants to go.
