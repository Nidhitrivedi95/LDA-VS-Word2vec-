Went there for lunch and had the opportunity to sit on their patio outside in the back. Their patio is just gorgeous with flowing leaves from the cieling. I had the beets salad and the spinach agnilotti while my colleague had the rillettes de lapin and the bavette. We both thought our meals were fantastic, the presentation was beautiful and the service was quick. This is the second time I go to this restaurant and intend on going back when I'm in the area. I love how the menu changes weekly so the ingredients are fresh and tasty.
