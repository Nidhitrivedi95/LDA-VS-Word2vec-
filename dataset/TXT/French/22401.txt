BSmqxPbQglQwP2R56OqOag We were out shopping and stopped by this place randomly for dinner and WOW! What a hidden gem! The seafood linguine and sea bass were both delicious, and the Manhattan was worth ordering a second one. But most impressive was how they treated our 4 year old son. The kid's meal was the most impressive thing for $4.95 that I've ever seen. Our son ordered a pepperoni pizza - which was a 12" wood fired pizza with artisan pepperoni that also came with a glass of milk and gelato. The service was impeccable and if we weren't here on vacation, we would definitely come back soon!
