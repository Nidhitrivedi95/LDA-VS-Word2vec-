xBxDMEkFK5GBhiy-8gGE9w In all my time traveling and eating, I've never been turned away. Adorable family of three arrives and most spots roll out the hospitality. So we've been fortunate: that's always been our experience. Up till now. That was not the case for this tiny cafe adjacent to the Contemporary Art Museum in Montreal.

With seats available, we were turned away at a non-meal hour 3:30 pm with multiple tables available when we mentioned that we wanted tea and wine on the patio, but hadn't decided on food yet. It was an arbitrary, abrupt feeling, even mean spirited experience. The hostess looked us up and down and said, "non!"  And of coarse we complied because who wants to eat anywhere that treats customers in this fashion?! Nope!

I was listening to a favorite podcast, "Splendid Table" about the difference between service and hospitality. It's a case of making a customer feel remarkably welcome. Here we felt completely the opposite.
