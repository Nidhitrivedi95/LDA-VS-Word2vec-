3FlWR_osNPb8dcqLgHebHw My friend and I were seated at 11:30.   The waitress, Loise, immediately told us her five grandchildren and kids were eating in our section and that she would be attending to them but let her know when we were ready order.   We tried many times to get her attention and it was 12:15 before she finally took our order.  After that, it was another 20 minutes before we received our food.  When I said we had been there over an hour without food she said that we didn't order right away.   The only reason we didn't was that we couldn't get her attention.  Bad dining experience, will not go back.
