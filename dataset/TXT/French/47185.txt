O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q We had very high hopes for the evening as our group of 12 arrived for our reservation. Drinks were ok if you believe a bleu cheese stuffed olive should be smaller than a marble. 
Appetizers arrived and the tower of seafood was amazing....but that's where the evening came off the tracks.
A second round of drinks escaped our servers mind, steaks arrived...cold...after more than an hour between courses.
The sides were good (asparagus, potatoes and mushrooms) but arrived a full 10 minutes after the cold steaks.
The 14oz ribeye had good flavor but wasn't outstanding.
Decided to forgo dessert since our "adventure was pushing 3.75 hours already.
All in all service lacks any sense of urgency or timing and food was mediocre.
