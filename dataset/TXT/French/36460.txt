i5vxtyiHKYnRcJ0p9N7mLw So Yummy!!! Emilie took our order. When asked what she feels is best to order, she without a doubt gave us great suggestions and even some samples! This place takes pride in their work and it shows in the flavor of their food to their customer service! Everything had great flavor! We got the antipasto to share and it's a big portion to split between four people with our own entrees. We got penne with the homemade tomato sauce and homemade sausage.The sauce was full of flavor and the pasta was definitely el dente! We also got the sopressata, capocollo, and asiago cheese half sandwich and DELICIOUS HOMEMADE CHIPS!!!! Gail and I chose the mascarpone and butternut squash raviolis with sage and quasi burned butter. The raviolis were phenomenal! Everything was super delicious. For dessert we had cannoli, tiramisu, and profiterole. I would say that the dessert were good but we got the tiramisu when it JUST got done being made so it didn't quite "set" and the coffee liquor was a bit much in my opinion. cannoli was good, crispy and light. Profiterole is profiterole, I wouldn't say it stood out as much as the others. Overall this place is a must try! Love the food and pride they put in it. Customer service is definitely exceptional. Thank you for your great business operation.
