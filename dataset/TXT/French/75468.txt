Ycp3Agr7dt71TZkeKV7jng The one item that keeps me coming back for more... Their Amazing Chocolate Chip Cookie!!! I don't care if each cookie is about $3... They're huge! I've bought dozens to get my friends and family hooked on it. And once you taste the soft uber chocolatey cookie... It is So Worth It!
I've had their croissants and souffle and they're pretty legit too. They also serve warm food and salads but the chocolate chip cookie is the lunch of Champions! 
I can't give full stars to Le Gourmand only because they don't have a stock of chocolate chip cookies at all times. They are super popular and oh sooo Awesomely Fresh that they get snatched up pretty quick right out of the oven. 
Call ahead to check if they have any on hand or just order a few dozen for next day pick up. You won't regret it.
