My reservation and confirmation I informed them this was for an Anniversary and Birthday. Also the couple with us this was there first trip to Vegas so we wanted a window table so they could see the town.
Our table was a booth that looked at the window but you could not see anything worth while except the Bellagio sign.
The food was mediocre and prices relevant to high end Vegas places. Portions were somewhat small and some of the dishes good and others just ok. 
Come desert I expected something for the occasions I mentioned but nothing as our waiter knew nothing of my requests.
My major issue is that there were more "suits" in the floor moving around and not once did anyone stop by the table to check on us. A top flight Resteraunt usually has Manger intervention on the floor to insure guest satisfaction. Not here yet many passed our table through the night.
All in all my last visit here as I get better treatment and attention at many other places in town.
