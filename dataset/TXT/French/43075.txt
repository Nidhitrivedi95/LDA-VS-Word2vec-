LQ_gYNs5E10IGFE0NOyD7A I was here about 2 weeks after the opened and I cannot wait to get back.  The design and layout of the place is right up my alley as I enjoy restaurants on the smaller side.  We ordered the burrata for an appetizer and it was really good.  I ordered the fried chicken which was phenomenal.  I would not normally ever order fried chicken, but there has not been a day that has gone by since that I haven't thought of that dish.  My only fear is that I won't ever be able to order anything else but that on my return visits!  We did the cauliflower as a side, also great.  We also had the ribs delivered to the table, compliments of the chef.  I'm not a rib person, but they were excellent.  My friend ordered the steak and again, fabulous.  Our waiter was awesome - very friendly, attentive and knowledgable.  I wish I could remember his name, but I do recall he was from WI as am I.  We were at a table outside and I did begin to get a tad chilly and before I knew it I had a blanket arrive at the table to keep me warm.  All in all, it was one of the best dining experiences I have had in quite some time.  I have seen a few negative reviews on here which I find incredibly shocking and I urge those people to return for a second try.   I know I am looking forward to going back!
