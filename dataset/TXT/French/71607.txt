XcWlBj5oQgzKhR7Cxovj3w I ordered the oatmeal, which looked good and the first bite was good... Then found a hair in it. Honestly wasn't super upset- I told the waitress and she took it back and I said I didn't want anything to replace it. My boyfriend got his burger after that. From that point on she never checked on us and I watched her purposely walk around the other way to avoid our table. I've been a server and have had this happen to my table- I know its awkward but if they have hair in their food you should do your best to turn around their experience, not avoid them. The hair thing happens. Customer service determines how things go from there. Took forever to get our check. Next time we'll make the walk to four peaks.
