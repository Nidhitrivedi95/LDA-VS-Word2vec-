dW9cPsvOGwlOpiz3wEBgiQ Meh. I ventured away from the recommendations and had the Brazilian chicken because I love Brazilian food and I love chicken... What could go wrong?

Turned out the answer is: a lot. Namely, it was not good. Bland, nothing like the flavorful Brazilian foods I've had before. The mash potatoes were pretty good, and the steamed veggies were done just right (although unseasoned). 

Sue had the shrimp avocado sandwich, which sounded delectable, but alas we're wrong on that count too. It was drowned in a thousand island like sauce that was too salty and all around bleh. 

The service is good but nothing extraordinary, and the bread is pretty awesome but not the butter. 

Honestly, I'm not sure i can justify coming back given how out of the way it is. Unless you're staying on the property, and even then, I'm not sure. 

Do not recommend.
