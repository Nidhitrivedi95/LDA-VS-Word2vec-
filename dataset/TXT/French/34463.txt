HOev_2CifUcfIm9xDL_uaw The food makes up for divey feel of this place. We looked up french food and this was the suggestion from yelp that was closets to our location.

The inside has a kind of strange decor and the tables could use a little help but the menu selections made up for it. The owner has a french accent and you can tell she takes pride in her restaurant.

I ordered the croque Madame and my husband ordered one of the crepes. It wasn't a traditional croque madame but it was absolutely delicious. Definitely worth the money and I would get it again in a heartbeat. So if you want a little taste of french food for a good price, check this place out.
