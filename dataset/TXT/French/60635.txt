SCklYa_jhihWAcfIn-_chg A lil taste of France in Toronto.... Sigh.  Bonjour Brioche wasn't our destination, but when we walked by it, I wished it was.  Thankfully Lady Marmalade had a line up down the street so we returned to Bonjour Brioche..and I am glad we did!!  Although the atmosphere doesn't quite warrant 5 stars; we had a rickety table and I was stuck behind a door looking into the dingy backyard of something, or someone's home.  The food, was delicious!   Everyone in our party really really enjoyed the brunch.  I really wanted to try their pomegranate mimosa however they can't serve alcohol before 11 am, and we were a bit shy of that time frame.   At the end of our meal, there was a server who came by with some very delicious looking desserts which we had no room for, but we did take them to go.  We then stood in line to get some fresh breads which were amazing!  Can't wait to go back!
