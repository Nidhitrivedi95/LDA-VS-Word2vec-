Grand, wonderful. 

Let's be clear here... the friggin' cheese board is enough to warrant a visit. Just listen to the sweet sounds of the gentlemen explain the cheeses in depth to the point that you'll probably start drooling. I mean, tell him what you like and you'll get exactly that. He's like the wikipedia of cheese info and if you love cheese, this is heaven.

The ambiance is wonderful, but what really stood out here, experience-wise, was the service. Witty, yet sophisticated, helpful and honest--wow. I'm talking about catering to your needs here people. And the bread service? Let's just say I've never had to tell the servers at a restaurant that I didn't want anymore bread before in my life. I think I ate more complimentary bread than I've ever had in my life! 

Other than the obvious cheese board I ordered, I also had the tomato salad (special) which was simple, yet delicious. The hanger steak was the same. I actually wish I would have ordered something better, and more special, like the cassoulet. It came with tender lamb and sausage--it looked divine. 

My fellow diners absolutely loved their meals, which included the beef short ribs (special), the escargot, the pate and the mushroom French toast. And I actually tried the toast and the broth of the escargot (..err rather, thick, rich, butter sauce) and both were indescribably good. Specialty cocktails? Ohmygod, try that Effen basil, strawberry one--it's out of this world. 

Pricey, but absolutely necessary. Get there, go there more often, enjoy. You're welcome.
