This is my 2nd try to this place. The first wasn't that great, so I took my time to come back and I'm disappointed again :(

We sat outside. What a bad idea. The table was next to untrimmed plants and flies were flying around during all the dinner.

I was craving pork belly and when I ordered, the waiter said that that was the only dish they didn't have. Great. I ordered cheese plate (which was the best of the night), baked potato soup (lame), fillet (with too much sauce and peppers, plus the spinach had no taste) and a side of caramelized onion risotto (which was a little more than ok).

In general good location, nice setting but just lame overpriced food.

Not sure if I'll be back.
