udFcIcbWbxrO8uLF95WnQg C & H has been our go-to place before shows at Playhouse Square, but after three times (at least) of not being able to eat and get to the Broadway Buzz pre-show on time, we're out.  Last evening, we arrived at 5pm, were promptly seated and given menus, and our server told us about the specials.  She returned with an iced tea for me (the other three were happy with water), answered questions for our guest who has dietary restrictions (and she did so with great detail and advice, which was much appreciated), and took our dinner orders (no cocktails, no soup, one salad that came with the fixed price menu order, and four entrees).  The one salad and entrees arrived shortly thereafter, and everything was delicious.  Our server took our dessert order (just one item for the person who ordered from the fixed price menu), and . . . we waited.  After a while, it was close enough to 6:30 (start time for Broadway Buzz), that we attempted to flag a worker.  To no avail.  I decided to hold up the dessert menu above my head to attract someone's attention (we continued our conversation with our guests), and did that for several minutes until the manager came to our table.  At that point, we really needed to pay our bill (not just have the bill delivered to us), and book it to Broadway Buzz.  The manager did have our dessert item packaged after we left, and we walked back down after the show to pick it up and enjoy it at home.
