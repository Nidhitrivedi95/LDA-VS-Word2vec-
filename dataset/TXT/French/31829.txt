I usually just come here when I have a sweet tooth - They have a good selection of cakes.  I tried most of their cakes - Cheesecake, Mango cake, Chocolate Grand Marnier and Strawberry meringue are my favorite.  It is around $4.50 a slice of cake but the portion is not that big.  8" meringue cake cost around $28 plus tax which is a little expensive.
