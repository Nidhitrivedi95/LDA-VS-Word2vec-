OkC86YtZ0Nm19my5F4GGrQ Stopped in with a few friends for happy hour (4-7) on a Wednesday night.  The restaurant was mostly empty with a few dinner patrons out on the front patio.  The bar service was great and so was the happy hour food ($6) and wine ($5).  I enjoyed a boeuf petite tartine with a nice glass of white.  Both were yummy and didn't break the bank.
