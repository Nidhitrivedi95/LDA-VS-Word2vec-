s-zwyD8YOm-y3AbRrsRx7w The food we had here tonight was delicious!  We had the goulash soup, Cordon Bleu, Wiener Schnitzel and Swiss chocolate fondue.  The goulash soup was different from most varieties we have tried, but we found it very tasty.  The schnitzel and Cordon Bleu were some of the best we have had.  The chocolate fondue was great!    It was such a rare treat for us and there were a wide variety of fruits to dip into the wonderful chocolate.
