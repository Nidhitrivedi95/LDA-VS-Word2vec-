3jKUbhGSjFTv5jZ0wnW0xA Small neighborhood restaurant with wonderful food and service. Parking is horrible around this area. If you plan to drive to this restaurant park at the school near the park around the corner. The food was excellent. We ordered the steak, lamb shank and the white fish.
They were all flavorful. The price is very reasonable for French cuisine.
