9iy6scMRbs5ue41XRLGEkw Came here for a murder mystery dinner which was so much fun! Everyone got to play a part and it's such a good vibe. I ordered a Cesar salad, chicken cordon blu with asparagus and a cheesecake. The chicken was so juicy and delicious. I ordered a drink that I wasn't too fond of because it had grapefruit but that was my own fault. Would definitely come back to try their food again outside of the murder mystery dinner.
