KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA Marche Bacchus is a very charming French restaurant (and wine store) right by THE WATER! Its dishes are tasty, service excellent, and the prices are on par with any mid-upscale bistro.

My wife and I had lunch and dinner with friends there a number of times. We like its sampler appetizer plate with several kinds of meats, paté, cheeses, olives, and preserves. Although this appetizer plate looks small, it is actually enough for 4 people to share over a drink. For entree, we love its scallops and duck dishes. For dessert, we like its popular bread pudding, which has a pleasing texture and not too sweet. The serving staff is very friendly and attentive. One evening, the restaurant was completely full, but our busy and efficient waiter (Justin) still managed to take good care of our table of 4!

Marche Bacchus is a must visit, at least for lunch on its gorgeous patio deck by the water in a hot Vegas day! Do ask for patio seating when making a reservation. But actually, its small, comfortable dining room is not bad either, the large windows do let you see a bit of the soothing water. My wife and I enjoy taking our out-of-town guests there. They are invariably amazed by the fact that such beautiful water ways exists in the middle of Vegas desert, and the restaurant is located in such a nice residential area by the water!

By the way, the front section of the restaurant is a medium size wine store. You can select a bottle of wine there for your table. Even after the corking fee, the wine is still a pretty good bargain!

- My only disappointment with Marche Bachus is that it does NOT offer Happy Hour! I'd have given it 5-Star, if only it offered happy hours!
