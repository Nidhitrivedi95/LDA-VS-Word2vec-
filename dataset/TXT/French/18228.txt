A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g I've been coming here for years. They have the best macaroons in Vegas. I'll try any macaroon, but this is the only place I come back to.

I know they may look. .... different. However, the taste more than makes up for the appearance of these cookies. They are taller than the average macaroon but the shell is soft and moist. The cream between is smooth and flavorful. 
I usually get salted caramel and coffee. Salted caramel is heavenly. It truly is sweet AND salty. Coffee has a strong coffee flavor.
Vanilla is good. The fruit flavors are nice. Not too sweet. 
Come for SALTED CARAMEL!  

They have other great desserts there. Lemon tart is good.
