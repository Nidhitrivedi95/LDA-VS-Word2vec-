pYg_w6Qj4vRTAX8Qbz3PHA Stopped in for brunch on a Saturday. Great outdoor seating along a lovely street. I got the french toast with caramelized banana and my boyfriend got the the Mediterranean casserole. We were both happy with our choices. The french toast, while very sweet, was delicious and cakey. The carmel sauce was perfect and smooth. The Mediterranean casserole came with spicy sausage, egg, vegetables, a salad and bread and jam. We also were given a complimentary cinnamon raisin bread to start, which seemed to be standard at each table. Very friendly staff, clean restrooms. An overall great experience.
