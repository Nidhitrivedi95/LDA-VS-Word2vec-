rSiSZlTzHi4Ox_rFHe9CdA Stopped by taqueria burritos and tacos this afternoon for lunch. Ordered 3 dishes and shared it with a friend. Ordered the halibut soft tacos, barbacoa crispy tacos and corn fritter soft tacos. 
They were all really yummy, but my favorite of the 3 was the halibut. My friend really liked the corn fritters. 
I really liked the fact that the guac is included with all the dishes. 
I will definitely be back!!
