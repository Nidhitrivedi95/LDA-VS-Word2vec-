lNB-yJoVi-sk6X0uoWOh-g Good, but not mind-blowing, maybe slightly over-done, and certainly overpriced.

Don't get me wrong, it was good and pleasant, service was great overall although it lingered quite a lot towards the end (maybe in the hope that we would order more drinks?), but it's absolutely not a "$$" price range, much more a "$$$". Entrees (I mean, main course dishes) are mostly above $30. We stuck to appetizers, more because they attracted us more than the main course than really for the budget. Nevertheless, for 8 oysters, 3 appetizers and 4 beers, we landed a $135 diner, which I find a bit exaggerate (I know plenty of places in Boston where for this price, you could either eat and drink something really exceptional, or feed twice as much people for a similar quality if note better). The octopus was certainly the best I had in town so far (this includes comparatives with Helena and Taverne F), but it was on the scarce side (3 little pieces), and still not at the level of the best one I had (in a little bistro/bar a vin in Niagara on the Lake... with twice the portion and half the price). The 2 tartars (tuna and beef) were good, but too heavy, un-necessarily creamy, the taste of tuna or beef was totally hidden by the respective too strong dressings.
