There was a good variety of items to choose from including their popular bone marrow jam.  It was good but I can only handle a few bites because it was a pretty heavy dish to start the meal.   My selections were steak tartar,  roasted chicken, and a sorbet desert in a cripsy cone that I can't remember the name to.  All were very food.  I usually don't order chicken but surprisingly that was my favorite item amongst all the items we tried.
