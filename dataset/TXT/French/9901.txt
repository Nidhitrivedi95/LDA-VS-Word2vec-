4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Bon Appetit, Mon Cheri!  If you're looking for good French food in Las Vegas, Mon Ami Gabi is definitely a yummy option. The bistro is charming and their dim lighting added to the intimate setting. Though still pricey, it was fairly reasonable compared to other restaurants on The Strip. Mon Ami Gabi is more well known for their brunch menu, but our dinner experience was just right for a girl's night out in Sin City!

Here's a breakdown of my food experience:

--Housemade Country Pate ($11.95): It didn't quite meet my expectations, but it was still a tasty effort! Unfortunately, the pate was not very soft or smooth.  Resembling more like the texture of ham, the pate was hard to spread on a piece of warm baguette.

--Escargot with Herb Butter ($14.95): The snails were tasty and tender.  However, there was a little too much herb butter for my personal preference.

--Carmelized Sea Scallops w/ butternut squash & brussel sprouts ($25.95): Perfectly cooked scallops - Yummers! The brussel sprouts were nicely charred, with a slightly sweet maple flavor. Though I prefer savory sides, it was still a delicious dish! 

Tip of the day: Make reservations ahead of time via Open Table/ Yelp, even if it's the same day.  That's what we did, and it was nice not to wait long to be seated.
