HL6ZzGF7V-KDaU0zziHyEA We (2 adults) walked in on a Sunday morning around 8:30 for breakfast before our flight home.  At first he hostess said they don't take any non hotel guests for breakfast.  The place only had maybe 5 tables occupied.  I said we had to be out in an hour anyways to get to the airport and they accommodated.  We sat on the nice back patio.  The scenery and seating was nice.  The garden is really pretty with 5 ducks swimming around.  We did a la carte.  I got the dejeuner fermier with scrambled eggs, a sausage, and a montreal bagel.  It was very filling and good.  My husband had the eggs bennie and he enjoyed it.  They could have filled my OJ a little more without me asking for a refill.  Nice for a quiet Sunday breakfast.
