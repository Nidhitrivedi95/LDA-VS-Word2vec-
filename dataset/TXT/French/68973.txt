VwZhwflLnTq19aAeFLJHCQ Bernard's Bistro is a 10 min walk from my abode. As others have said, there have been many food places occupying this space recently. I hope this place stays. I was very impressed with the food and ambiance. Had lunch with two others. One had Caribbean chicken salad, one had a chicken wrap and I had the Express Lunch.. Cup of delish beef barley, a small mixed greens with a house vinegerette ( a violet purple dressing? !!), and a tuna avocado on a fresh soft bagette. Food well prepared, server was very friendly. I took off a star for two reasons. 1) it was a bit loud and the restaurant was at best 1/2 full. 2) while the service was friendly the food took a bit of time to be delivered, and the waiter cleared the plate a bit too quickly. Two of us were still enjoy bread when the plates were removed. I can't wait to go back for dinner, hopefully soonish.
