Eoj4-cffvbIQxLTO-C_K0g Opened for lunch on the weekdays with a $23 three course prix fixe that changes daily and minor changes to the a la carte menu.

Had to clear security (x-ray machine + metal detector) to enter Osgoode Hall and then there was signage pointing to the restaurant. It was a quick and painless process.

On the day me and my friend, the prix fixe menu was a beef croquette with pear chutney, chicken breast, and an apple cake. The day before it had grilled octopus. It was delicious and the portion sizes were just right! My friend had the steak frites, which seems to be a staple of the menu, is served with lots of fries! We also got two pieces of complimentary bread each.

Service was excellent from the moment we walked into the restaurant to the moment we walked out. There was no waiting to be greeted or calling for your bill and each course came out fast. They treat you like royalty basically. The line of stained glass windows and bookshelves of law books was really something and most of the waiters had a french accent, it felt like we had left Ontario and went to France for lunch.

It was simply an amazing lunch. Although the restaurant never filled to capacity during our hour there (12 to 1), they do recommend a reservation and this can be made through OpenTable.

Will definitely be back in the future to show off this gem to friends.
