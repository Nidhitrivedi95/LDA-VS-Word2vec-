rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w Spent 600 for two and I left this place with little disappointment.(Don't think it's enough for me) Of course the food is very tasty and one of the best meals in Vegas.The view definitely worth something! I will suggest this place for couples. Sweet and Romantic (with the view and lights).
