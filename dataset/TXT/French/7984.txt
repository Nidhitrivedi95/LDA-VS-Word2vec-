4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Wow! What a pleasant surprise! On the strip. This French restaurant does the French classics extremely well. Started with the steal tartare which was delightful. Followed with the French onion soup and then the lobster roll. All delicious. Service was really good. Sat on the outside patio where you can't beat the people watching. Their house champagne was lovely.
