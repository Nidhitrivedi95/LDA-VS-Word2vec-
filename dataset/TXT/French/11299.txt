4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I came here for brunch on a Saturday and had tea, croissants, and their eggs benedict. The eggs were delicious! They were made just right and served over a large slab of Canadian bacon and a large, perfectly toasted English muffin drizzled with Hollandaise sauce. There were two, and was accompanied by hash browns, which I loved. They were the perfect crisp and saltiness. I definitely want to go back and try their other menu items.
