jSfnItqaOnEp2nenVF7fCg What a freaking fun little spot!  

Our family had a great breakfast at this restaurant and service was very good.  The beignets were a hit with my daughter and wife.  Waffles were a perfect crisp on the edges and loaded on top with fruit and real whipped create.  Syrup tastes like cinnamon buns.  My wife's quiche was cooked to perfection with airy egg and perfectly infused cheese flavor.  And my crepe with ham and swiss cheese was amazingly tasty, large, and filling enough that I only ate half.  I wanted to finish it, I just couldn't  

We'll be heading back and hoping to catch when they do their French Onion Soup...

One oddity: We had called ahead and were told they did not take reservations.  When we arrived and asked for a table, they asked if we had reservations.  Chatting with them, it sounds like they do take reservations in the winter/spring (snowbird season) and they apologized for any confusion.  Space is at a premium at this spot, so call ahead.
