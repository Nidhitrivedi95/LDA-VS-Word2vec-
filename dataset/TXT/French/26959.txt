Dcj69NZJnbJhK-YHP_nULA Peruse the menu at your discretion.  They went to great effort to get the Euro vibe right, complete with a formidable domestic and imported beer selection, with an emphasis on Belgians.  The food options range in scope from a well designed house "V" Burger to various entrees with a higher price point.  My previous review made mention of the friendliness of the waitstaff person I encountered, but the female server I had on this occasion had an attitude that was somewhere south of a "sour apple".  No matter, the food and drink was prompt and I didn't expect her to elocute her problems, as I was not really up for that.
