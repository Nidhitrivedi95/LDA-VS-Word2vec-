m9aFZk1f8tSv248YErbpQA We just came here for breakfast and they turned us away at the door. They weren't very busy but she said she only had one cook so she wasn't going to take any more customers. We weren't even given the option to wait. She wasn't very friendly about it either. Didn't even say sorry. If you care about how businesses treat people, I wouldn't patron this one. The cook situation is one thing, the attitude is something else. Not to mention its a managers duty to step in when shorthanded.
