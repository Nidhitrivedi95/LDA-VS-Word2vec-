hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA How did I not stumble upon this amazing Baguette place?
Here's a short yet simple way on how I would describe this place.

+ Customer service
+ The aroma and smell
+ Affordable prices
+ Vegan friendly, many vegetable options
+ Fresh food
+ Very clean

I ended up getting a ham and swiss croissant because I had heard that the croissants are legendary! Perfect butter proportion, and the ham and cheese melted perfectly.

My friend had gotten a Pesto baguette, I didn't get a chance to try it but judging the look on her face she was extremely satisfied.

We ended up staying almost 2 whole hours!

I would most-def come back if only I lived closer!
Will be back soon!
