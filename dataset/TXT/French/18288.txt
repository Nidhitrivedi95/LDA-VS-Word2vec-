A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g So much to chose from which isn't a bad thing. The girls made recommendations for us and also gave recommendations on how to pack the treats up for the long drive back to the Bay. We ended up buying a lot of Macarons, the truffle cake, the fraisiere (strawberry) and something made up of cream puffs drenched in chocolate. Can't wait to dig in to my treats!!!!
