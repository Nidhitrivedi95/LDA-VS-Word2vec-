SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ What happened? I hadn't been to House of Tricks in years when four of us decided to go there for lunch. The service was still friendly but it started out badly. Despite our reservations we were seated in the middle of traffic near the kitchen. Not the worst thing but more of an omen of things to come. The Bloody Mary I ordered was too spicy for me but there was no offer to adjust the heat. Instead our waitress said "I can bring you tomato juice."  The cheese and fruit plate was a bad joke. There was barely any cheese or nuts or fruit. The dishes we ordered were all disappointingly mediocre at best. I don't think any of us took home leftovers though there was plenty left on our plates. House of Tricks used to be wonderful. I won't go back.
