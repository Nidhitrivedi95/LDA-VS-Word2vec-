3jKUbhGSjFTv5jZ0wnW0xA Our meal at Les Deux Garmins was our favorite while in Montreal. We were four adults and ate at the restaurant on a very quiet Monday evening in mid-September. The restaurant is located in a very nice little pedestrian area just off Sherbrooke; good people watching. They have a nice seating area outside, but we ate inside as it was a bit chilly. A cool Monday may have contributed to the sparse crowd, but we did eat at 6:30.

Everything that we had was very good (including best bread we ate in Canada). We started with Escargot in Puff Pastry and Foie gras with roasted black figs. For our entrees we had the Duck confit l'orange and vegetables and the Filet mignon, mushroom sauce and truffle oil, boulangere potatoes and we had a creme brulee to polish of the meal. Accompanying our meal we had the Seguin-Manuel Bourgogne "Pinot Noir", which was a terrific companion to all that we ate. Everything was excellent and very satisfying, although the dessert didn't have the hard carmelized top we're used to. Escargot was pretty light, foie gras was rich and buttery, the duck had a delectable orange syrup that enhanced the richness of the meat and the filet was fork tender. An excellent meal at a lovely little restaurant.

We are from Texas, so not too likely we'll be in the neighborhood any time soon, but if we are, this will definitely be the first restaurant on the list!
