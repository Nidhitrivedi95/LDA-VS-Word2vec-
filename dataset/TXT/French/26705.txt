Da6eZFThE9xanUAGNpZxAg My girlfriend and I went here on a date on a quiet Monday night to celebrate Valentine's Day. We were blown away by the taste and presentation of the food. Not to mention the wonderful and personable service from Jeanelle(unsure of spelling). She was very knowledgeable and welcoming. The ambience was excellent and the experience all together was top notch! Would definitely come back asap!
