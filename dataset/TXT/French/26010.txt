d482l58ho0_IMdFkXX1F5Q What happens in Vegas should also happen Arizona...bring DB to AZ! French food was wanted. So here I was - with some bread and butter - regular. You could tell service was better than your average when they give you bottomless water refills at your halfway mark.  The crispy duck hash sparked my taste buds. Presentation was beautiful, portion was just right, and taste was flavorful. The only thing I questioned was the egg. It was supposed to be egg-yolk-runny. But there was also egg white runny....which should not be present. The potatoes on my plate were not as soft as the other who also ordered the same dish.  I could see the potential of an excellent dish, but because my plate in particular was not cooked correctly, I had to give it a lower rating.
