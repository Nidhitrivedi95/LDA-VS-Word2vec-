EEIz44ewHhOKmfTloAK13g Let's start off with the service. The service is superb. This is the reason for the 5/5. The servers are friendly and very personable. We were lucky enough to sit at the counter in front of the kitchen (chef's table) which allowed us to see the food being prepared. We were able to talk to many of the staff and the manager. Absolutely no attitude here. They were here to make your dining experience the best.

This food here is very good but I would not say excellent (4.5/5). At the counter, we had to have a 10 course meal vs. the 7 course in the dining room so we got to try more.  Plus we had 4 desserts. The mushrooms, pork  and bread (yes bread) were excellent. Everything else was just very good. 

The wine guy, Christopher, was great. I didn't have the wine pairing because it was mostly white wine which I don't like while the others I was with did. So, I had red wine and each time my friends got their wine, I also got a new red wine. The people I was with didn't like their wines but the reds I got were great. Christopher explained each wine in detail. I also had the vodka fix cocktail.  That was yummy.
