4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Gabi, you are indeed a good friend.  I've been to both locations in Chicago as well as this one in Vegas.  It's perfectly located in the Paris hotel.

For chain french food, this place is very good.  We went for brunch on a Sunday and enjoyed the crepes.  The smoked salmon and the cheese plate were also great appetizers.  

If the weather permits, request to sit outside on the patio as it gives you a great view of the Bellagio fountains.  The atmosphere in the restaurant is very french, even if the crowd isn't.

The one odd thing was that they ran out of iced tea during our meal, but they made good on it by subtracting the teas from our bill.

Props to the Paris hotel for targeting the gay market.  The BF and I were pleased to be seated next to four family boys during our lunch.  

All in all, brunch at Mon Ami Gabi is a great way to spend a Sunday afternoon in Las Vegas.
