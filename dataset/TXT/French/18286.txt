A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g Far off the strip, lies a little french patisserie in a strip mall, baking up a huge array of macarons, tarts, cakes, tortes, napoleons, and everything else. 

I only got macarons, but the pear tart was looking mighty fine.

About their macarons - they were just a DOLLAR each when I went last year - looks like the price has gone up a bit. They are NOT the best macarons ever, far from it actually - but they are just a dollar, so what can I say? 

Rose - Weird tasting. Avoid.
Lavender - Better than Rose, slightly fruity.
Raspberry - Overly sugary. Weak flavor.
Salted Caramel - Easily the best of their macarons. I'd definitely get this again.
Pistachio - Overly sugary again. Flavor was ok.

And there were probably more, but only the salted caramel was memorable at all in my opinion. 

Just a note, but don't go here on rainy days. I went on a rainy day, and unfortunately, humidity matters a lot when making macarons, so almost all of mine were lacking the crisp texture and slightly crunch  you expect from a fine mac (I don't think this bakery has proper conditioning). Normally though, the hot, dry weather of Vegas would be fantastic for baking up these babies.
