3jKUbhGSjFTv5jZ0wnW0xA UGH. One of the few times Yelp has ever steered me wrong. I apologize to my 3 dining companions that I forced to eat here with me :( 

The good: The restaurant is pretty cute. There are 3 levels, including an al fresco dining area. The french onion soup was pretty darn tasty.

The bad: All the other food. Escargot - fine. Salmon tartare - srsly? we had to add a crapload of seasoning to make this edible. Mussels - wayy too fishy, couldn't even taste the broth. Lamb and filet mignon - terribly terribly salty, yuck. 

The ugly: Our entrees took over 1.5hrs to come out, and the restaurant wasn't even full! We were so bored we started playing the Name Game while we waited, and my boyfriend bet my friend $1 for him to put pepper in his mouth, straight from the shaker. Yeah, we were that bored. 

The super ugly: My friend's veal scallops came out COLD! We initially thought maybe that's how the dish was supposed to be served? Wrong. The waitress informed us that it should be hot and took the plate back to the kitchen. 40 mins later, we were all done with our meal and we told them to just cancel the dish. Their response: It's right downstairs! They brought it back out after what we assumed was a quick reheat of the meat and it turned out to be completely bland and dry. Disgusting. 

They comped us for that one dish, but really though they should have comped us for the entire dinner. Most of it was either spent waiting for our food or trying very hard to eat our dishes. They only offered a mere apology AFTER we tried to flag down a waitress for our check for 15 mins and she asked "how was everything?" and was met with blank stares. Sooo upsetting, and such a waste of a meal in Montreal!
