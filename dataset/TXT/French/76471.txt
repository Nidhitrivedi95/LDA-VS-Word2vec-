Yp9w4nhUowBU_IS_StFXbQ Lesson learned: it's not worth paying the extra few bucks for a 'kobe' beef burger.  When the meat is in its minced state, you can't tell which part of the cow the meat really came from.  

In the spirit of finding a new brunch service that could exceed or at the very least match tried-and-tested Bouchon, I came across Tableau.  It looks fancy, it's in the fancier, poshier part of the Wynn (if that's even possible!), it's hard enough to find so nobody would just chance upon it, and the glass rotunda in the middle is definitely where the better tables are.  The four of us were lucky enough to get one of them.  

The service was excellent, we never had to ask for the server to top up our coffee and there was never a time that we had to flag down our server.  

The food though, was a bit of a let down.  Maybe I should've tried the orange-infused French toast with honey butter or the eggs benny that a few other yelpers were raving about, instead of the burger, because the burger was, well, ordinary in every way possible.  The hub had an omelet that was too overpowered by onion and the side of bacon was just so so.  

So given the price, I would rather go back to Bouchon for their blueberry friands, sourdough bread, chocolate croissant and pommes frites. http://www.yelp.com/biz/bouchon-las-vegas#hrid:PjzTZX9Il0c4LV-ezt13hA
