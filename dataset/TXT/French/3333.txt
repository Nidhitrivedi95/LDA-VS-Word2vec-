1cGyzWtfOoDiE8V0OR85yA I was going to eat there. While I was choosing what to order, and after my wife had sat at the table, we were asked to leave the table for someone else.
Meanwhile there were plenty of people sitting at their tables talking over empty plates. They have double standards. 
We left the place and are not thinking of going there anytime soon.
