YMcGgFQDEarRQ22ml1z_VQ Cute, humble cafe that's a nice addition to the neighbourhood east of St. Hubert. The crepes are delightful and there's choice between traditional or a sarrasin variety. The coffee is a nice cup and the server/barista/cook was as friendly as ever with the biggest smile this side of Little Italy. Ain't that nice :)
