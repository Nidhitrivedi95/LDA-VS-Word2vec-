KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA Went here to enjoy some appetizers and a glass of wine for Valentines day. I was planning on a short stay and I was told with no reservation I would have to sit at the bar. This was impossible considering I had a six year old child with me. I used to work at this establishment and am discouraged to ever return. Sure wish Greg and Agathe never sold the place. What a shame when new owners purchase an establishment and forget about the people that made it once successful.
