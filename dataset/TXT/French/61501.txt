SJo_IjvzdRtCvZVN0cbrRQ It was expensive for mediocre food. They had recently changed their menu to become "upscale" per their hostess, which I feel has diminished the quality of our experience. I have talked to previous customers who agree that this change was not warranted. We will not be returning.
