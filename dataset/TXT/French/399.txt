-ClafaRWkSRTfieIzO4r3Q I've been here a few times, when it was the Junction Eatery and Roux.

Derrick is a master in the kitchen and I've never been disappointed in any meal there. 

If you're there for brunch, get the waffles. You will not be disappointed! And his Huevos Rancheros? SO MUCH BETTER THAN Cool Hand of a Girl's.
