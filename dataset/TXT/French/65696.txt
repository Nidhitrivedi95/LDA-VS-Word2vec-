U50YoWOEmagNix2sbD-yMg J'dore Chez Cora! It's the best place in America's hat for some petit dejeuner: wonderful pancakes, homefries, and great orange juice. 
Plus their logo is this cute little smiley sun. I accidentally imported one of their coffee mugs to America because the little sun way saying "take me to America! American movies come out quicker there!"
Always a line, or should I say queue, on weekend mornings due to those Canadian wake and bakers but they have the right idea.
