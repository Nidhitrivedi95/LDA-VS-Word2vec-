58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw * Nice physical spot, ok brunch *

The physical layout of this spot is really nice.  It is a long narrow space with painted brick walls and wooden tables, along with about 8 sidewalk tables.  There is also a small food market towards the front, which had a very nice selection of chocolate and some local products like smoked duck in a can, etc.  

I had brunch at one of the sidewalk tables.  

The brunch included:

- A sweet bread (not sweetbreads, but a cake like bread, which we were never served although saw all of the other tables getting)
- A smoked salmon egg scramble, where the whites and yolks were not fully incorporated to each other
- Half a bagel with cream cheese, smoked salmon, and capers (tasty local bagel with nice quality salmon)
- A sweet potato and salmon cake (was a bit cold and crumbled apart but had nice salmon flavour)
- A green salad (which was good, but slightly overdressed)
- Some cut fruit (fine)
- A glass of orange juice (unfortunately not fresh squeezed)
- Coffee or tea (I had a nice quality tea, although the water was not as hot as it should be)

The sidewalk tables suffer from the attack of many bees.  The two women at the next table had a constant battle (probably their strong perfume was saving our table a bit from the onslaught - but we had our fair share as well over the course of the meal).  My side tip - open some of the confiture packs and place them away from your table to attract the bees away - it seems to basically work!  

Overall the brunch was ok, but nothing I would rush back for.
