KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA My husband and I went in for a Sunday brunch. I made a reservation thru 'Open Table'  for 2 of us at 10a . So we arrived there on time and there was only an old couple just before us. However, we were seated on an outdoor table right next to the plastic curtain which smelled disgustingly bad. I mean it was dirty as a restaurant. There were straws and some food wastes under the table. Anyways, I ordered Lobster salad croissant and my husband had Croque madame. Both dishes were very flat and funny. It was funny because they only used imitation crab meat for my 'Lobster' salad croissant... Since me and my husband lived quite long time in France, some times we miss those popular dishes like 'Croque monsieur / madame'. We both thought their version was the worst. We came here because I heard good things about the quality of their food and pretty lake side setting. Unfortunately, we could't experience none of them. Very disappointed.
