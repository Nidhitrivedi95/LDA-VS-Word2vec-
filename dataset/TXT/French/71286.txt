xcmmTXhuMx2fZF2Bt69F4w We just love to go to Point Brugge for the wonderful Belgian style mussels and frites. Although there are four choices of preparations,  my favorite remains the red curry, with its blend of coconut milk, lime juice, basil and cilantro. The Brugge frites are great dipped in the basil mayonnaise sauce. They also have many beers on draft as well as bottled.
Point Brugge is not only good for lunch and dinner but also has a wonderful Sunday brunch. There is a Prix Fixe option which includes a choice of entree, a side dish and a choice of Mimosa, Bloody Mary, champagne or cider. It is definitely a bargain, if you plan to make it your main meal of the day!  You certainly will not leave hungry.
