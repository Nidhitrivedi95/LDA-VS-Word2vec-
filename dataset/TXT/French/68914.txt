VwZhwflLnTq19aAeFLJHCQ Atmosphere was manic at best. Multiple signs telling me to "EAT" which is ironic considering the food was pretty inedible. You're greeted at the door by a faithful replica of the captain of the doomed ocean liner, Titanic. How that factors in to the food or the decor, I still have no clue. In retrospect, I think it was a premonition. 

Onto the food. I ordered the NY Steak Frites. My steak was tough and tasted strongly of regret also the gas grill it was fired on. The sauce that accompanied it was minimal in both taste and amount. And the vegetables served were bland and undercooked. The only part of our meal that was satisfying was the Caprese Salad. Which it's pretty hard to mess up slices of cheese, tomato, and basil. 

If you enjoy subpar food, disturbing decor, and paying way too much, then you will love this place.
