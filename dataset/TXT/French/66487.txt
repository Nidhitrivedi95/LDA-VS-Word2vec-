uP3H5bcsiTXM0k0xQhRndg My friend and I had a horrible experience and I will make sure to tell people how stupid the workers think their customers are. First we looked this place up and saw some great reviews not seeing a menu and had some high expectations. We sat down and looked at the menu that has like 7 things on it and we wanted to leave and go somewhere else, not liking the vibe we were getting. I decided to stay and see what the hype was all about and got the beef shoulder and gnocchi.
When you order your beef to be medium rare you expect pink with a little blood on the inside. The beef that came was medium well and dry. When we complained the lady actually said that she went to culinary school and knows what medium rare is and that maybe where we come from it's different. I'm 100% positive that medium rare is the same in ANY country you go to Miss Attitude! You didn't offer to give a new piece of meat cooked the way SHE wants it or something else on the menu to compensate for your lack of knowledge of how meat should be cooked. You actually had the nerve to yell WOW after you walked away from our table. We paid $78.87 for 2 of your dishes and walked away with a horrible taste and still hungry. The steamed buns down the street were the only thing that saved the night after experiencing the worst customer service. This tiny place with the smallest menu really needs to work on their egos and satisfying the paying customer. Do not expect the food to be cooked the way you like it, it's the way they like it and will try to make you feel like you don't know how food should look or taste.
