_cjPEH9wXhKS-HQe_U3M4Q Went here for lunch with a bunch of family members the other day.  I saw them when I walked in, so didn't bother telling the hostesses that I didn't need help with seating (since I didn't), and when I walked by they looked very confused/concerned by my apparent act of rebellion.  They even stared at me for a few minutes after I sat down.  As a former hostess myself, I would like to send them "don't worry about it, dudes!" vibes.

Anyway our server (guy with brown hair) was super helpful, friendly, attentive, etc.

I ordered the most ground-breaking and daring thing on the menu - the croque-monsieur.  

YUM IN MY TUM

I like cheese and bread and ham, I also like cheese when it's mating with ham between an envelopment of bread.  And then I like cheese when it's melted on top of the previously mentioned orgy.  That's what they gave me, along with way too many skinny (tasty) fries.  

The couple next to me laughed when I stuck my butt in their faces to get out for a few minutes (close-seating), so the accompanying clientèle were great in my books.  

I will return here, it's just down the street and I like cheese and I want MOAR
