xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g The view and the service at this place were top notch, but it ends there....at the end of the day, I go to restaurants to eat. Maybe I'm spoiled by real steakhouse restaurants, but any place charging $64 for a single serve steak should know how to cook it. The first one came back medium well when ordered rare. The waiter tried to convince me the sunlight was somehow giving me vision problems. They promptly did get me another attempt. This time ice cold seared for maybe 10 seconds. They tried one more time and got the temp just about right, but it was still a pretty poor cut for a New York strip.  Mashed potatoes never tasted like bananas last I checked, but the other mushroom side we got was solid. So, go there for the mushrooms and the view and you'll love it.
