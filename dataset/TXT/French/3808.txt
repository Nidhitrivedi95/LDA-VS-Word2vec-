2B46bRpDh49eDyjXGhL_ZQ We got there around noon on Wednesday.

The place is quaint and inviting and I felt I was in Paris. There were 2 tables ahead of us. You order at the counter and seat yourself. They serve smoothies, crepes galette, and coffee. The patrons will bring the food to you. We sat at the bar and watched our crepes being made by Maggie.

We both had galette (savoury buckwheat crepe) each and they came with a side salad. Crepes we ordered were
Polo - ham, blue cheese, fresh spinach and Flying Baby- tomato, mozzarella and blue cheese. You can add any ingredient for $1.

The Crepes were thin and light and flavourful. I didn't get a chance to try their Sweet Crepes. The owner, Maggie introduced her homemade jams and she mentioned her produce were locally grown at Gilcrease Orchard.
