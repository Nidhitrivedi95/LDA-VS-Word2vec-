tCSlpwJQ4CZsUEMZeH2SFg I lowered my expectations ahead of time since I'd read the other yelp reviews, but Cafe Monte managed to outdo themselves with bad service AND bad food.

Our server passed by us several times, and when after 10 minutes I asked pleasantly if my companion and I could please order some water and coffee, he literally rolled his eyes and walked away. Then he served the beverages with no utensils or napkins. 

I won't quibble with the uninspired menu -- it's Cafe Monte's choice to offer what they wish, and mine to patronize the place or not, based on looking over the menu in advance. 

But the simple strawberry crepes were stone cold -- not room temp, not chilly, but obviously just plated straight from the fridge and served! (OK, in fairness, they may have been run from the freezer through the microwave on "defrost.")

The filling was the same pasty, tan substance as the topping. I thought it might have been a flavored cream cheese but I discovered at first bite that it was neither flavored, cream, nor cheese. 

Should I have sent it back? If I had seen our server, or any server, I might have. Rather than ask my companion to wait while I attempted a reorder, I nibbled the few slices of strawberries, picked at the crepe itself, and chalked it up to another mediocre suburban restaurant outing. 

Au revoir, Cafe Monte.
