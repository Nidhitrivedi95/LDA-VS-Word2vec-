lQ9VmIWvM6v-rONPkYX8aQ I had the 7-course tasting menu with wine pairing. I can't fault this place for the food-- it is creative and very, very good. Everything was delicious, and the wines were equally as impressive. The service was also very good, but not great.

But I absolutely cannot give a restaurant a good rating when I walk away feeling like I was just ripped off-- badly. And both people I was with completely agreed. The prices they charge here are totally outrageous. It was only 7 courses, and the portions were TINY, and I simply didn't feel like I got my money's worth whatsoever. I was annoyed enough at the tiny portions, but when one of my "main courses" of short ribs came out and one of the two miniscule pieces was 95% fat, I wanted to scream (and I don't mind fat one bit, but this was ridiculous to serve!). 

Maybe if you just won a ton of money at the casino, or just have the urge to blow a ton of cash, then maybe you won't mind paying waaaay more than you should. But take this into account: You can literally eat at The French Laundry, perhaps the best restaurant in the country, and have a mind-blowing THIRTEEN course meal (plus extras) for as much, if not less money. And I'm speaking from experience. And you will definitely not feel ripped off like you will here. 

I would never, ever come back here unless they came down to earth on the prices. But I guess if you can keep getting suckers to keep paying that kind of money more power to you.
