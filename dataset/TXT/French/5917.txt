3rj1qpgFvkRWtAka17mhEQ Horrible place ! Smells like mold , old and dirty! 
I'm a lactose intolerant and Vegan , that was my first visit to Mimi's Cafe and the last one for sure ! 
I asked for a vegan option and the waitress suggested their veggie burger, I asked over and over agin if she's sure it's dairy and eggs free , meaning vegan and not just vegetarian. She went to "check " and said that it's for sure vegan ...
The food finally arrived, in my first bite I realized that there is a cheese inside the petty !!!!!!!
The manager offered me a fruit cup instead my dinner... lol ... wake up ! Vegan don't eat only fruits and veggies! 
If u hungry.. just find a better place!
