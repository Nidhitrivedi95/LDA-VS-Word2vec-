gjCmXkMNVE0JSk8puUwv6g I googled Vegetarian restaurants because my daughter-in-law was in town for a convention and I wanted to take her to dinner and she is very limited in what she can eat. When I picked her up at her hotel, she chose EATT from the choices I provided. Wow! The place was new & clean, the service great and the food was wonderful. We shared the broccoli guacamole with chips & the eggplant on buttery puff  pastryfor appetizers and then we both had the salmon with quinoa and beets. The salmon was cooked to our desired medium rare and with the miso honey marinade tasted fantastic!
