KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA Went there with a party of 9.  I heard they had had some good press and according to the waitress had been overwhelmed with business.  The service was SO SLOW that we were there almost 4 hours and not by choice.  Not once did a manager or owner show up to offer an apology.  The food was better than average, however by the time we got our meals we would have thought a boiled work boot tasty.  I won't ever return but hope that they hire enough staff to give better service.  There are a ton of quality employees looking for jobs.  Hire some if business is so good!!
