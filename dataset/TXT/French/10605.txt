4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw So. Dang. Good. My BFF and I are in town for the weekend and looking for a low key breakfast. This place is slightly spendy ($40 for the both of us) but the food was amazing. Don't get me started on the coffee. Legit the best black coffee I have ever had. I will go back tomorrow just to get more coffee. Oh, and this place is gluten-free friendly. :)
