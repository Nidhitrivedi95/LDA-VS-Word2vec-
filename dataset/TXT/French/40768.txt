kcF-en40P3J9L8nLy5lKqQ I surprisingly had not heard of this place before driving past and trying it out today! I am so glad I did because it was a good experience. I love how the restaurant is set up, lots of big windows and outdoor seating. Though I am sure thats not as nice when it gets hotter in the summer. But it was cute and I liked the interior!
We went for brunch at 10:30ish and there were not too many people there, we were sat right away. Our server was super nice and accommodating. I loved how the water glasses were made from old wine bottles, that was a cool touch I thought. Was awesome that they noted if an item was vegetarian or gluten free or not, always super helpful. I was debating between the veggie omelette or the basic breakfast pizza. I decided to ask if I could pretty much have the best of both worlds and get veggies put on my pizza haha, and the waiter had no problem with it! My mom also asked if she could get veggies instead of meat for her two egg meal and he happily agreed. Did not even charge us extra which was nice! 
Our food came out pretty quickly and it was really good! I do wish there was some type of sauce on the breakfast pizza as it was a tad dry, and the hot sauce did not help much. But the crust was absolutely incredible. My mom loved her meal as well. The potatoes she got were very tasty, I stole more than a few! 
I would love to come back for another meal sometime, the 'drunk bread' sounded extremely delicious!
