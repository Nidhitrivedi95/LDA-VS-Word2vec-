5fquJHY2hMX9tPRD5s0t5g While I've been to both Rooster's locations many times, this was my first lunchtime visit and guess what... 5 Stars again!  I'm glad too as there was some amount of reputation at stake since it was a team lunch and all I was doing ahead of time was raving about Rooster's.  Thankfully, and no surprise, they delivered.

We all started with a cup of tomato basil bisque and right after the first spoonful there were unanimous sounds of delight.  Lunch main dishes around the table ranged various salads, chicken salad sandwich and one special of the day which was catfish tacos.  Everyone was fully happy with what they got.  Service was spot on as well with glasses of tea and water kept full and enough checking in to make sure all was well without being overbearing.

Winner, winner, Roosters dinner.  Err..... lunch. :)
