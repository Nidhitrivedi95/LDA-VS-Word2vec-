O3OH5IEFMPtz7mPKakPZ3Q Wow! What an original.  I've never had the combinations of flavors I've experienced here. Great service and fine dining atmosphere without the pretentious vibes. The food and menu though is truly one of a kind and more thought out than anything triple the price on the strip. They treat locals right and offer something truly unique in a town full of the best food in the world.... I would put them up against anything I've had in town easily. Imagine your own neighborhood Nobu but waaaay better and half price. They truly appreciate their customers and you can tell they enjoy blowing people's minds with the flavors in the food they produce. True passion that shines through in everything about the establishment.
