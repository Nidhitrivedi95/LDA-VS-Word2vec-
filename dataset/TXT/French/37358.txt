j0baDQfMAGDm_QGdFMmb-Q Just had dinner here tonight for the first time since new owners took over (about Sept 2015)  Couldn't be more pleased. Quaint atmosphere,  owner is involved and adorable. Her husband is the chef.  The food was fantastic and I am French and come from a family of restaurateurs. I am definitely highly recommending this little Bistro and will be returning often. Really truly enjoyed everything. Made me feel back at home but in beautiful Arizona. Casual and warm. A small piece of heaven. Wishing you the best Voila Bistro!
