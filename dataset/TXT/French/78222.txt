YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g I don't take the time to write many reviews, and I've eaten at some really great restaurants since this but my mind keeps making me want to go back to Fleur.  We went in December of 2011 and it was extremely memorable.  It was my typically traditional Mom's first time eating tapas and she loved it as well.

She was surprised to see how small the tuna tacos were when they came out but we ordered plenty of dishes to keep us full.  The tuna tacos, basil mussels, steak with chimi churi sauce, and lobster mac and cheese were all amazing.  I didn't try anything I didn't like.

There were 4 of us and we all ordered 3-4 tapas a peice.  It was a great way for us to all catch up with each other after we hadn't seen each other for awhile while enjoying dinner. They timed the food perfectly so we never had too much on the table or were waiting for food. 

We used the restaurant.com gift certificate which was a great deal so we were all able to get a few cocktails and dessert as well as the tapas for $43 a person. Amazing deal. 

Save room for desert the creme brule came in original, rasberry, and pistachio, best creme brulee I've ever had. 

All in all best tapas and best place I've eaten at in a long long time!
