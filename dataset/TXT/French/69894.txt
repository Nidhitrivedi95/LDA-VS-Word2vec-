WOj8nPos3R9IIf0Pyttd8g Tried it out today for breakfast. First time here. Cute little place with fantastic service. Owner was there with his kids, and they seemed to know a lot of the customers. Had a tasty breakfast- smoked salmon on a bagel. Good coffee. Relaxed atmosphere... I was able to read a book while eating with limited distraction. I'll be back.
