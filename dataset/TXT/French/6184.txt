4cWrtMvfj-tomyEPgP7KFg Thank you so much to Chris and kelly and the whole crew! We came in for an early dinner to celebrate my new engagement. After trying on dresses all afternoon, 5 ladies came in hungry and thirsty. One of the girls called for a bottle of champagne that was chilling before we sat down. We came in a little before the restaurant was open so we enjoyed a glass of wine with the great bartender while we waited for our table.
If you have a choice, ask for Chris. He was very attentive and explained the menus to a bunch of fondu newbies. He and kelly were working a room together so we were always taken care of. The food was amazing. We came in to try the Restaurant week menu and we were not disappointed. 
As good as the food was, I cannot rave enough about the service. The staff wrote me a card to congratulate me on the engagement and brought a candle on our desert dippers for our birthday girl in the group. So incredibly happy with everything that I had to let you all know the moment I got home! Thank you melting pot!
