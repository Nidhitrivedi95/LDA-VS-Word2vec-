gCbS0X8w7vZ9CLWvMNXocA I have been here many times in my day but I haven't been for years.  This place isn't street level and isn't really easy to find if you weren't looking for it but it's a quaint place that while it may be French doesn't make you feel out of place.  

Jacque's Bistro Du Parc while they do serve French cuisine is actually rather affordable for as it has a great ambiance and feel and location but really makes you feel welcome.  I will admit I'm not a fancy guy.  I don't live rich and this place is a real treat for the break of everyday meals because French is not something I have a chance to have everyday or even every month.  

The menu for lunch is lighter fare such as omelettes, soups, salads.  I went with a salmon.  I had just had smoked salmon for breakfast a few hours earlier but I was on a fish kick considering I hadn't had it in a while and it was a Friday.  

Prior to the meal coming out the server came back twice to give me some hot French stick which is just a treat with butter.  Nothing says French like a piece of warm French stick with butter.  

When my meal came it was just what I had wanted for lunch, a nice butter and basil sauce and 2 nice pieces of fresh salmon.  The potatoes were toasted and hot and everything was just dressed in that wonderful butter.  French cuisine has a lot of butter sometimes, and this was no exception.  

I hardly drink white wine because I prefer red but I did have a nice dry white with this meal and it complimented the dish quite nicely.

For a nice change of pace, Jacque's Bistro is just that.  A quiet, classy place with a nice space and friendly staff all overlooking the big Cumberland Rock across the street.
