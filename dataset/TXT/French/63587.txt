t1mR_Zff6Dqv1TueE2JLEA Our party of 3 picked Cafe Maroc for a Summerlicious dinner: $25 for cozy/sophisticated atmosphere, NICE portion sizes (i like paying money to be full), and lovely intro to Moroccan cuisine. good deal!

the MAFTOUL was akin to spring rolls, with an excellent crispy (not at all greasy) shell and lightly curried beef filling. well balanced with the chipotle aioli.

my entree pick of MOROCCAN BEEF SHORT RIBS was by far the best! incredibly tender meat (my heart skipped a beat when i first dug my knife in) deeply infused with flavour. borderlined a bit too salty, but paired well with the accompanying potato/parsnip mash.

i only tried a bite of the MANGO SALMON, but it was easily forgettable for me -- could've used more mango salsa.

the BRULÉE ROYALE was quite rich but not cloyingly sweet and my loves: apple pie + cheesecake joined forces in the SPICED CINNAMON, CARAMEL, APPLE CHEESECAKE. not too sweet, not too heavy, awesome apple flavour, and it was made with what seemed like an oreo cookie crust, which was bizarre but it worked :)
