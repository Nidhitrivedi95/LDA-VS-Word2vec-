4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw As a vegetarian I always have had a hard time finding restaurants that make good veggie food! This place just blew me away! The avocado toast was just DIVINE!!! So so good! A must try even for meat eaters! 
Kudos to the chef for creating something so yummy for us eggatarian folks! 
And Trish our server was really sweet, amazing and very friendly. She actually cared that we got our food on time and that we enjoyed it!
