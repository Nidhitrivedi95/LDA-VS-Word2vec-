gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA I guess you can say I had high expectations for this place since it I read good reviews about it and the fact it was on the top floor of Palms and I was familiar with Chef Andre's work.  

We were sat right away after arriving in the middle of the restaurant which I was not a big fan due to the fact I wanted a seat by the window for the view.  Here's what we ordered: 

Pan Seared Scallops appetizer- 3 scallops?! for 29 bucks?! Hmmm..........no thank you 
12oz Australian Wagyu- Not what I had expected
and the girlfriend had the Duck which was cooked pretty good. 

Overall in a nutshell, probably my first and last time here.
