4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Mon Ami Gabi is my "go-to" restaurant for special brunch dates, when family is in town, and when I'm wanting a good steak! Since I'm local in Las Vegas it would be rare to find me in the heart of the strip but this restaurant has the best ambiance on a warm summer day, great service, and amazing brunch selections.
