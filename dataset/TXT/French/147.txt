-4TMQnQJW1yd6NqGRDvAeA Love. This. Place. This restaurant is just simply perfect. I love the atmosphere (chic), ambiance (cozy), cuisine (modern American) and located off the main street which gives it a more low-key feel. It is a smaller restaurant with a great outdoor patio and amazing decor both inside and out. And don't forget about the oak tree, oldest one around.

House brisket and biscuit was superb. It was rich but extremely flavorful. All of the cocktails are hand-pressed and exquisite. 

Save room for a cup of coffee and if you're going to do that you may as well have some dessert. Coffee is amazing (and dessert). I will be back to try more!

An extreme fan of Chef Matt Carter! You definitely will not be disappointed, the best combo of service and hospitality for all!
