AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw I'm an idiot and keep coming here whenever I go to Vegas with a new person.  Granted, I go to the takeout counter, which is cheaper and possibly worse than the sit-down restaurant, but probably better than the express counter by the casino entrance.  As usual, takes me forever to find.

We had the croque monsieur (still good, would probably be better fresh) and an apple crepe which was forgettable.  So... yeah.  Lukewarm rich French food.  Still forgettable!  

If you do go, try sending out someone in your party from the line to hover for chairs.  There's just a little less than enough seating, which is a good trick: tables are always full, which makes you think this place is awesome.  It is not.
