Prices are reasonable- could run you about $40 if you're frugal.

Didn't try any of the scrolls people are writing about on this page - had the half roasted chicken. It was a little on the dry side and didn't have much for additional flavor other than the sweet BBQ sauce that came with it. Also came with mashed sweet potatoes. 

Caveat: Gave me the runs in about 25 minutes.
