el-3IdlW3bTCSnquLvH-3w We had a remarkable dinner.  Like getting away. Gastronomique extraordinaire. From wonderful wine and cheese selections, to pastries, with coq au vin in between!  The service and music selections made our evening perfect.  We do not prefer to go to a chain.  And this restaurant is why.  Enjoy.
