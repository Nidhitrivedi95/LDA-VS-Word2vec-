4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Great food for the price.

I had the roast chicken since I wasn't hungry enough for steak.  Good, not great. Cook perfectly!

French Onion soup was so-so.

Steaks are cut thin so dont expect anything thick and juicy but the flavors were great (sample from friends).

The Liver mousse and event he free carrot salad for the bread was great!  Don't fill up on the bread as its very hard to stop eating it!
