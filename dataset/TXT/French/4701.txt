Great selection of desserts and service is fast and friendly. Nice big terrace outdoors with the option of couches, bar stools or chairs. Great touch!! Their millefeuille is a must try . The meat and cheese plater has a nice selection and their thin crust pizza is delicious.Very warm and 
authentic being there!
