FRuuIDOd21pTJHvEGIt1Gg Really loved this restaurant, as the perfect french bistro. We had a french onion soup, and seared foie gras, gingerbread, red wine reduction, and dried fruit for appetizers. For entrees, we did the salmon tartare (as a main), and the lamb shepherd's pie. All dishes were delicious, with the foie gras and the salmon tartare outstanding. The restaurant was roomy and had a lively vibe. Would definitely come again.
