aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw I have a slight obsession with macarons. So I seek out authentic macarons. This is my ultimate favorite place to get authentic macarons. They are absolutely divine, and by far the best I've had state side. Doesn't even matter what flavor, they are so perfectly made. 

To bite into the perfectly baked crunchy yet chewy cookie then taste the incredible filling...it's heavenly.

My old favorite was Earl Grey, but I recently tried the Peanut butter and jelly which is....Amaziiing!!! They now make large macarons, as well as my favorite little ones. The vanilla bean, pistachio, strawberry, and chocolate are all  fantastic. Always grab at least on sea salt caramel, they are superbly delicious.

If you are in Las Vegas or Beverley Hills go to Bouchon's Bakery!!
