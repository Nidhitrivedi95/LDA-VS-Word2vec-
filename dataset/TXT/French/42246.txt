KzZcH8Ez81xcyKFsVjR30A While I love french food, I don't like to eat at beat down dark dingy places serving food for price of gold. Not sure what so romantic about a place where you can't even see your food. Cafe theatre is quite the opposite, its bright, trendy and kid friendly. Servers are very inviting and the food really good. I had the veal liver, it was amazing, melted like butter. Do try the snail, it was different from what I expected but really really good. I will surely visit this place again.
