EEIz44ewHhOKmfTloAK13g Was fortunate to dine at Alo Restaurant last night at the chef's counter where I had the blind tasting. 13 courses PLUS canapés to start as well as an amazing and decadent  cheese course (Délice de Bourgogne - cow's milk cheese from the Burgundy region of France). Watching the chefs in the kitchen was like seeing a special show, a lively dance, so wonderfully choreographed. It was quite the experience. 
My compliments to Chef Patrick Kriss,     
Co-owner *along with the very  personable GM, Amanda Bradley* and the entire team at Alo. I felt not just a welcomed guest but a VIP at that. While the food was beyond amazing, both in presentation and flavour, it is the beautiful service that I received that will make me return.
(As an fyi to make a reservation for the chef's counter call the restaurant directly at 10:00 a.m. 60 days prior to the date you want. The cost per person was $130 + $85 for the wine pairing, which I did not partake in as I was driving but my counter mates kept raving what an amazing job the sommelier did at pairing each dish.)
