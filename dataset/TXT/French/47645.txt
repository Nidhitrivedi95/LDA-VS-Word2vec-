O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q Good food good service thou pricey. It's Vegas n it's inside the hotel. Expected. 
We had the salmon rillette. Good. 
Tuna tartare. Above average. Still good. 
The bread w butter n mashed olive spread. Good. 
I wanted medium well 14 oz prime ny for my kids to share. It came out well done but still juicy so acceptable. 
Had 6 pieces of raw oysters. Not bad but not that great. May be because they were not that busy. Server said because they are usually a convention guests restaurant where there's a corporate credit card that can be charged to, in other words expensive!
I recommend it. Not bad.
