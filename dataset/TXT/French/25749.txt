Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA Came here for a quality meal.

Pros
Food was tasty amd the food runner was describing every item as it arrived and kept our water full. The server made sure our champagne was full as well. View was epic. Drinks came quickly. Tje place is pretty cool looking also.

Cons
We waited at the host desk for 2 to 3 minutes while people looked at us but no one helped us. The restaurant was completely empty. We finally got a table outside and it was wonderful. The second downside was that our server was less than communicative. He didn't seem like he wanted to be there and acted very monotone. The literal service was good the personality with a bit of a downer.

We will try elsewhere next time. There are a ton of restaurants in LV.
