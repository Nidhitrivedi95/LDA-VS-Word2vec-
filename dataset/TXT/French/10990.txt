4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I love this restaurant.  I love it so much that I had my wedding reception here!  This places is full of Parisian flair, from the decor, to the servers, the wines and of course the food.   You must try the Filet Mignon in bordelaise red wine reduction sauce. The escargot is just out of this world.  The wines are all french so of course I had no idea what I was drinking but who cares.  I like anything with Le or Les in front of it. Outside seating is very hard to come by but I don't care for outside seating much because I hate to watch drunks pass out as I'm about to eat my food.  The indoor dining area is romantic, cozy and you forget you're in the middle of the las vegas strip with people gambling all their pennies or millions away.  The dark mahagony furniture, red velvet drapes and crisp table linen sets the mood for a delightful evening.  At night though, the view of the Bellagio water show is to die for.  Just gorgeous.  The service is worth mentioning.  They're impeccably attired and all have some sort of french accent (fake I know but I just love it).  They're attentive without being intrusive.  I love this place!
