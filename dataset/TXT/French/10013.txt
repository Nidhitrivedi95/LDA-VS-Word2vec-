4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Review for Saturday Dinner.

As a girl who lived in France for half a year, I had a lot of expectations for this restaurant, which were met but not exceeded. 

The restaurant has two seating areas, one inside - which is very reminiscent of restaurants in Paris, and the other is an inddor/outdoor patio with a view of the Bellagio fountains, which was really nice planning on their part. The ambiance was really nice and the dim lighting gave the restaurant a very romantic feel.

Now onto the food. Like I said, I lived in France for little while so I was both really excited and really nervous to try this place - excited because I love and miss authentic French cuisine and nervous because I know what many dishes are supposed to taste like. The waiter gives each table a fresh baguette in a paper bag along with creamy butter and carrots, all of which tasted just as I remembered while I was living abroad. 

For our appetizers we had the warm brie and the escargot, both of which were delicious! The only criticism that I have was that the escargot was already out of the shell, but I am pretty understanding as to why that was. For escargot newbies, dip the bread in the garlic and butter sauce for an excellent and flavorful bite! We paired these dishes with the COTES DU PROVENCE (Le Provencal), a rose from the southern part of France (which is known for their rose), and it was great.

For my main course I had the Chicken Grandmere (or grandma's chicken) which was very simple, but tasty. 

I would definitely come here again, but maybe for breakfast.
