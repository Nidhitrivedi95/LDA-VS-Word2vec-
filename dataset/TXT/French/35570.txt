htQgj-ANQpZGpIpkkrEmyQ After a year of trying to get over the bad service, I finally had the opportunity to try this place with my friend. Made reservations on the day of and actually got them, surprised me a bit, I guess it's popular but not like when it first opened its' doors.

The menu was interesting with Asian fusion choices, the combinations were interesting. Udon Carbonara, Chicken Waffles and etc..

I ended up ordering the Udon Carbonara, same as my girlfriend. The food was good but I can't say it was very delicious to a point that I'm desperate to come back tomorrow. Service was attentive. All in all, a place that is worth a try!
