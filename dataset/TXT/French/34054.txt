hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA We were expecting a typical hoity toity sandwich place, but we were wrong! This place serves up the best sandwiches in Las Vegas, in my honest opinion. I had the mushroom, apple, walnut and brie sandwich (you can opt for chicken instead of the mushrooms,) and it was heavenly! It came with bleu cheese, but I am not a huge fan, so I told them to go light on it. The right amount of tanginess with creaminess and savor from the mushroom made this heaven in my mouth. My daughter had the 3 cheese with prosciutto, that in itself is a delectable item. There is a small salad on the side and the sandwich portions are pretty large.
I also ordered some ice coffee, and from a non-coffee lovers point of view, it was smooth and non acidic.
It is down the street from here, I would of never know about this gem, if it wasn't for yelp. Now we can head down here for our cravings for gourmet sandwiches!
