oS96aJIHFWcFAlGHKKXjaw Compared to Tartine in SF and Balthazar Bakery in NYC, Gourmandine is a real disappointment. And when there is no comparison, it's still not that great. Is it because I came later in the day rather than the early morning?

Tried the flan and it wasn't as rich as it looked. I was expecting creamy but it was a bit chalky.
The Paris Brest's hazelnut cream was delicious, but the pastry tasted over a day old.
Same goes for the Roules a la canelle - it was a bit stale.

At Beard Papa in Japan, SF, and NY (yes I went to all 3!), the choux pastry is always fresh, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I was expecting that from Gourmandine, which boasts 5 stars on Yelp. Maybe I'll give it another try one day, but only in the early morning.
