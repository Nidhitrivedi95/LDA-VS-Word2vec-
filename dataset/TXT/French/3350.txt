1cGyzWtfOoDiE8V0OR85yA Kind of underwhelmed. Crepes are such a versatile food, and I've had some absolutely delicious crepe combinations before. The ones here were neither filling, nor unique, nor cheap to me. I felt like almost all of the savory crepes were ___ + cheese, with the exception of the salmon crepe. I ended up splitting that and a Belgian white chocolate crepe with bananas with a friend. They were just OK, and the sweet crepe was a bit more special in terms of flavor. Overall, I think there are better options for lunch or dessert around.
