cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg The foie gras poutine is worth the visit alone. I love the fact that this place isn't pretentious -- it's egalitarian in the sense that you don't have to be some sort of snobby foodie to enjoy yourself. I was comfortable in jeans and sneakers. (Granted, I had to wear jeans with a loose waistband, because by the time I left, I was practically popping out). 

We started with the foie gras poutine and a salad, which seems odd given the rest of the menu. But the salad was topped with rabbit and a deep fried soft egg. Very good.

I had the Duck in a Can, which arrived around twenty minutes after our appetizer plates were taken away. Included a giant chunk of duck breast, foie gras, and fat. Love the fat. Only weakness was the puree and bread the canned duck was emptied out onto -- I was hoping for more of a mashed potato, it tasted more like sunchoke or parsnip with cabbage. 

My husband had the beef rib, which looked like something Fred Flintstone ordered in the opening credits of the Flintstones (y'know, at the drive in movie theatre, where the server places it on the car tray and the car tips over?). You'd think a hunk of rib that gigantic would be tough and sinewy, but quite the opposite -- it was so tender and nom-tastic. 

I wish I'd left room for dessert, but after all that foie gras and fat, I felt like I was going to keel over and die. (From happiness as well as fullness.)

The only crappy thing was that we had a 9pm reservation and we weren't seated until 9:40. The hostess was really nice about it, though - she offered us something to drink and was very apologetic. Once we were seated, it wasn't that long until we received our appetizers. Despite this bump in the road, the experience was still amazing from start to finish.
