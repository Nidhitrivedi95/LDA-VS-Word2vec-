Although it is in the Palms which is its own separate island and culture, I was surprised to see this place empty besides one other elderly couple. Although the place was wide open they for some reason chose to sit us in the back of the restaurant with a post in front of the view. Why they did this I have no idea. We asked to be moved and they seemed shocked and output that they would have to move everything. However, they did move us to a table on the front window and the view is just gorgeous of the strip. I ordered the duck and the portion was small, and the grapefruit was that topped it was so tiny that I would have missed it if I didn't ready the menu thoroughly. My date ordered some kind of fish and he said the skin was all slimy and gross. The fondant dessert was just okay. I would actually rate this place three stars, but the view it so great that I had to give it four. Overall, I am not sure I would go back. There are too many awesome places in Vegas.
