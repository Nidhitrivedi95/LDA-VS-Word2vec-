The kale and dumplings were also very good.  Had the shrimp stuffed peppers as an app, but they were way spicier than the server lead us to believe. The beer selection is pretty good for the type of restaurant also with some unique drafts and a good bottle selection.  Overall, I'd definitely go back.
