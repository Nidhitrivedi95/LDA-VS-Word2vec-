cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg I have been here before and the food is off the hook. I emailed for a reservation a month ago. I got a response that said please call the restaurant or provide a number for your reservation. I replied with my cell number and hearing nothing assumed I was booked.
  My usual trip to Montreal is a day one but  as APC is dinner only I booked a hotel for overnight.
  Day of, my date was sick so I thought rather than wait till the 6pm reservation, I would just arrive when they opened and sit at the bar.
  When the restaurant opened I was 3rd in line 2 in front of me 2 behind.  They could not find my reservation, and stated they do not do email reservations. Further, they stated they were completely booked and there are no walk-ins. A completely empty restaurant at 5pm and apparently no room for a lone customer who traveled 800 miles there for dinner with what I thought was a reservation.
  Sometimes suceess breeds egoism, but when a restaurant looses focus on hospitality, they can easily leave you with a bad taste in your mouth. 
FYI I am not neophite when it comes to dining out. Check my profile.
