DOmVF9YKOvTkqjcgUwtOgQ This brasserie was exactly what we needed on a cold, damp January Sunday.  Exceptional service, and beautifully appointed.  Special mention goes to the paintings on the wall - very Toulouse-Lautrec; a nice respite from the cliche French advertising posters on the wall at every other brasserie.

We had:

Crab cocktail: Delicious crab, very strong lemon flavour with a creamy base, and a japanese seaweed salad on the base - I would have to say that they were delicious separately but that the seaweed salad detracted from the delicious crab!

Onion soup: I have a wheat allergy and they accommodated us by serving mine sans bread - what a treat.

Eggs Cocotte: What a fun way to eat brunch! Baked egg, chanterelle mushrooms, cheese and herbs - just the right portion size and served piping hot.

Mussels: Beautiful broth, lovely portion. 

Drinks: Mimosa and bloody Mary (nice and spicy with lemon wedge and celery stick, rock salt on the edge)

This restaurant is pricey - our brunch for 2 rang in at just over $100.00, but for a last-minute getaway to Montreal, we were pleased.
