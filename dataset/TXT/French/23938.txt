cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg I had just landed in Montreal and looking for a good restaurant. Au pied de cochon had the best reviews so I decided to go there. I was not disappointed. Of course, you have to like meat. But assuming you do, that's a great place to eat.

I didn't have a reservation. so on a Saturday evening it was not easy to get in. But I was alone so I could sit at the bar. Right in front of the open kitchen. It was rather hectic (don't go there if you want a quiet dinner) but it had a great vibe. All waiters were friendly and very knowledgeable. And the food was awesome. I had the pickled tongue and the Côte du cochon heureux (happy pig's rib) with a couple pints of their own brew. Everything was great and everything else I saw looked delicious. I would highly recommend it.
