This little place is tucked behind the escalator on the first floor of the Venetian (Casino level) next to the Grand Lux Cafe and Guest elevator entrance area, across from the Apothecary store.  Prices are high, but typical for what you see at the Venetian.  It is worth the splurge.  Note: Bouchon Bakery is located separately from the Bouchon restaurant, which is found on the 10th floor of the Venetian.
