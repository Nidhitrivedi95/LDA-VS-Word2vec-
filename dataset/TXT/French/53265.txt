QeFsIMcIFIJcOrpthYL8jg Good location and atmosphere. We had dinner on the lower level next to the jazz singer which was nice.

Food quality varied - the soup was great, the shrimp appetizer and the fish entree were good, salad nicoise was very bad - they first forgot the boiled egg, but were apologetic upon being reminded and brought us a couple of eggs on the side,  and the tuna tasted like chunks of salt. 

Service was decent but quite slow. We were there for over 2 hours for dinner. Overall a mixed experience, and it wouldn't be at the top of our list of Montreal restaurants we'd revisit.
