37kk0IW6jL7ZlxZF6k2QBg well.... I think I was expecting a lot more for a restaurant that needed 1 month advance reservation. I think the price/portion/decor is suitable for its location. We were group of five and had the set menu. The food and service was not bad, but was not great either..... everything was kind of.... average.
