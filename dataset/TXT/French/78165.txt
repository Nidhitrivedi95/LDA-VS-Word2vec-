YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g Very simply, not worth the money. Very small plates for high prices, funky menu and not very many options. Kids would have a rough time. 
The waiter wasn't clearly happy that we don't drink so we were not even offered coffee or dessert, he just dropped the check. He wanted to turn the table I suppose. Very disappointed!
