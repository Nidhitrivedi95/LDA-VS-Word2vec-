U2S9n1asjTTI_EvBFBNnAw Good location in Old Montreal.  In the tourist area but still nice.  We read the reviews after we sat down and were worried but my meal was fine.  I had their maple and cider chicken which was fine and had good vegetables (I changed from rice to salad and the dressing was very good).  It wasn't the best meal but perfectly acceptable given it was in a very touristy area.  Staff were friendly and attentive.  Prices were reasonable.
