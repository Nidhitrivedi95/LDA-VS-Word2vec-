Yp9w4nhUowBU_IS_StFXbQ Ah, the ultimate conflict: good food, poor service. 

I loved the fresh bread and butter, the french toast was delicious but a little sweet, and the chopped salad with avocado was pretty great. The only thing I was not impressed with was the peach pancakes - they're just plain pancakes with peach pieces on top, at least you can take the time to toss a few chunks into the batter!  Also, I know this is Vegas but $4.50 for an iced tea makes me want to puke.

My reservation was useless, we got sat 45 minutes after our slot time, ugh. The waitress was a mess - my order came out 100% wrong and had to be sent back. I asked for my salad to be packed up and 15 minutes later, the waitress claims that "someone" accidentally threw it away...but I guess the upside is that I got a shiny new salad.
