uTCOEqjuVAXUOzti5TWj2Q If you're a fan of crepes, sweet or savory, The Crepe Club is worth checking out...either for a light brunch or midday nosh if you work near the Biltmore Fashion Park.

I was fortunate and was able to sample their sweet crepes for free as part of a promo that was listed in AZ Central.

The creperie itself is small and bright. The light wall paper and chandeliers give the place an air of casual elegance.  There's even "patio" seating just outside the door, shared with Royal Coffee Bar & Roasting Co.  The area has enough shade that enjoying your crepe al fresco is perfect.

Looking forward to trying my first savory crepe soon! 

Four stars for service and available seating. Three stars for the sweet Parisian...due to serving it in the paper cone, all the sugar and butter appeared to pool toward the bottom. Still tasty. Five stars for the Regular and Mini size options!

Jury is still out on savory crepes.  Perhaps, my updated review will be bumped up to 4 or 5 stars after I savor something savory.
