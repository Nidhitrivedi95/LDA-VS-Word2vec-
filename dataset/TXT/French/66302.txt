uP3H5bcsiTXM0k0xQhRndg Mom and pop shop; sisters are servers, brother is the chef and mom does the desserts. Everything is "made with love" and as corney as that sounds, appears to accurately describe the made from scratch and home cooked feel of this cosey eatery.

The place is pretty tiny, maybe holds 15-20 tables of average size. The sisters do a pretty good job of keeping an eye on everyone, and the older sisters bubbly personality made us feel at home. 

Food: the menu is very limited. With that being said there is enough variety to cover different tastes and they have beer and wine to match the meal or your tastes. 

The star or the menu is the Mac and cheese. I was skeptical at first but there is not another dish like this in my Mac and cheese adventures and deletions and fantastic seem like hollow descriptions in comparison. 

The roast beast with mushrooms and huge slices of bacon was the most ordered and most popular. Almost a stew, the beef fell apart with a fork and each spoonful held a magical moment with bacon and mushrooms in some kind of magical sauce. The bread is fresh made every day and comes already buttered to help you sop up every tasty bite. 

Honorable mention goes to the butternut squash soup and goat cheese with dried tomato tarte, both loved by those who ordered it, but not quite my style.

For dessert, momma Robin had cheesecake, Creme brûlée, and a bread pudding that disappeared despite grumbles of full bellies before they hit the table. The sauce on the pudding is fantastic, but a little dry for me. The cheesecake was more cheese like than sweet and made a perfect compliment after dinner. The Creme brûlée was good too and all came with a chunk of semisweet chocolate. 

If my talent as a wordsmith has not impressed you, I will condense the above for you. I would go out of my way to visit again. You will not be disappointed.
