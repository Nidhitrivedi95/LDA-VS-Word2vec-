AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw I always try to stop here when I am in Vegas.  They have a wide variety of sweets from chocolates to gelato to crepes to fancy pastries.

Favs:
* Coconut macaroons (the best I have ever had)
* Banana caramel crepe
* Apricot cheese danish
* Sweet Relief (a pastry cake with tropical flavors on the outside surrounded by meringue)


Needs improvement:
* Should have gold boxes of chocolate (Ballotins) year-round
* French macarons (Bouchon knows how to make them)
* Vegetable ratatouille crepe (needs a sauce to pull it together)
* Flourless chocolate cookie (truly awful when I had it last week - bad texture, not sweet enough, flavor was off, like it was missing an ingredient)
