We read that the patio is rated one of the most romantic spots in the area and decided to give it a try for date night. It isn't super romantic in my opinion, but the candles and overhead string lighting do make it a cozy outdoor experience. 

The food was very good, my favorite item was definitely the smoked burrata which offered a delicious combination of savory soft burrata cheese with the light sweetness of the date gastrique. 

I was disappointed that although the menu lists a soup & salad section there was no soup available. The salads were okay, I preferred the "Little Gem" salad to the Arizona arugula which lacked flavor and substance. The Gem had delicious candied walnuts and crispy lettuce with enough dressing to make it taste great. 

The chef brought out a couple of complimentary pastries with parmesan and truffle oil that was delicious. In fact, I liked it more than anything else we had. 

The crispy chicken was good, not dried out like you find at most restaurants. I also recommend the Brussels sprouts, they are crispy and full of flavor.

I had the Smokey Manhattan which was surprisingly tasty and refreshing. If you aren't in to sweet drinks then it isn't for you.
