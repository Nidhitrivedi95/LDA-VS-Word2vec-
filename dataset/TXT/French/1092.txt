_eNeiqWPt1MPLFF6DEIJeA I tried this place when it first opened a year ago. We had a sit down dinner and it was awful. My tuna poke was literally still frozen. A year later I figured I would give it another try through Uber eats hoping they worked out their previous issues. This experience was worse. First, the order of 3 sushi rolls took 45 mins. When the Uber eats driver arrived she had been given the wrong order to give to me. It wasn't even close to correct. When I called roxu they seemed very confused about my order and I agreed to just go pick it up myself. I wish I had stopped at little ceasars on the way home because this sushi was down right inedible. It was soggy, bland, terrible raw fish, and they didn't even provide us with ginger or soy sauce. The bartender was rude when I came to pick up the order as well. I will never eat at this place again.
