cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg Au Pied de Cochon was one of the things I was MOST looking forward to on my Montreal trip! 

I mean, how can your mouth not water at the sound of foie gras poutine?! The possibilities here are endless, and trust me, they have a ton of good stuff here!

We started off with a couple of drinks (some beers and a few specials each night) and ordered the following: cromesquis de foie gras, crab salad, temaki de bison, poutine au foie gras, stuffed pied de cochon, and duck in a can.

I can honestly say, each one was amazing and we overindulged. The cromesquis was the perfect bite, the crab salad was fresh and delightful, the temaki melt in your mouth tender, and the poutine au foie gras, stuffed pied de cochon, and duck in a can were all that I dreamed of and more! To be honest though, the stuffed pied de cochon and duck in a can are both heavy in taste and the flavors started to meld together after a while, but they are both still delicious. The presentation of the duck in a can was unique, and the tender pork of the pied de cochon topped with fatty melty foie gras was unbeatable. The stuffed pied de cochon is a large portion, so keep that in mind - it was a little too much food for my family! 

The staff there were some of the nicest and friendliest people, which just added all the more to the experience.

5 stars all around!
