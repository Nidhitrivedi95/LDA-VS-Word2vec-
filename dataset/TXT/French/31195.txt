ggIWkJtgXHKnhdxRu338AQ We've been going to Creme for many years and really enjoy the food and the great service. The staff makes you feel more like family then a customer. Our children (ages 8 and 12) love to go to this restaurant more than any other in the city. They are big fans of the rack of lamb and my son who is usually a picky eater, orders the calamari and braised lamb shank. Creme has by far the best patio in Yorkville, tucked away in the middle of the heart of the city. No small portions here either (unlike most French restuarants). Great place for all occasions. Upscale but not pretentious....a gem that we've certainly recommend to friends and family.
