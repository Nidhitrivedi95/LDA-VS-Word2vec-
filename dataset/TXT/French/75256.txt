y0cgy0tTh_C8NWCk0WGgjQ I love this restaurant. But every single time I have gone, I have gotton sick and so have the people I came with. They use something in their seafood dish for 2, I can't figure out what it is, MSG maybe? But the next day and this happened on two visits, I have a violent severe allergic reaction. Last time, my friend had their vegetable dishes and she went home and was violently ill as well. It's too bad as their dishes are excellent, but I always feel like crap afterwards. Service is questionable too. The servers are always making fun of the customers, in a mean spirited way.
