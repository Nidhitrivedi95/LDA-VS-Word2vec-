aW6Z4NSqEVli-xYMV3jRyg I gave Zebra another chance, and have been let down again.  Maybe Zebra was once a AAA 4 Diamond Restaurant, but not anymore.  The tables are cheap and uneven uneven, and chairs are kep in a bathroom stall. service is sloppy and lacks knowledge, but still pretentious.  The service staff are basically order takers who lack any attention to detail or the impeccable customer service of Zebra's former reputation. The "manager" is  unprofessional and rude it's a miracle if he is still an employee.  A grown man,  working in the service industry,  representing a business was picking his nose in and around the kitchen.  What a disappointing time for a once AAA 4 Diamond Restaurant.   I hope they can turn it around.
