O3OH5IEFMPtz7mPKakPZ3Q Two of us decided to share some of the smaller plates.
We ordered:
1 Tuna Tacos (1 order = 2 tacos)
1 Salmon Tacos
1 Chawamushi
1 Salad w/sesame dressing and tobiko flakes
1 House fried rice
1 Truffle Bone Marrow

Everything was really good. We didn't order any entrees, which were def on the more expensive side. Everything we ordered above was very reasonably priced and made for a great meal. 

We both agreed that the Tuna taco was better then the Salmon. The flavors in the tuna taco were nice and simple. The salmon had too many things going on and the flavors kind of all got lost. 

The Salad was better then I was expecting it to be. The dressing was great, not too heavily dressed and the tobiko flakes were a nice texture. 

My favorite item of the night, the Chawamushi! We didn't get it with the roe and uni, as I wasn't sure if my dining partner was adventurous enough to appreciate. I didn't regret the plain Chawamushi at all! It was fantastic. I've been craving this since last eating it here.  And very cheap! 

I wasn't a huge fan of the Fried Rice as my dining partner described it as greasy, but she liked that. I didn't so much. But also another cheap dish. 

Truffle Bone Marrow was damn good. Although not sure I would order again, but happy I tried it here. 

By making a meal of the small plates we had a great dining experience at a reasonable price. I would definitely go back and eat this way again and try some of the other small plates...
