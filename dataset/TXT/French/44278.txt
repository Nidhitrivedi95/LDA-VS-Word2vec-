ME6D5nLlfG0xZCtICOYDuw Absolutely fantastic food, service, and atmosphere!  Katie recommended this as her favorite, and I will have to agree.  Jeff took excellent care of us, and Georgio just happened to be in town and stopped by to say hello.  The scallops were perfectly prepared; the charcuterie (especially the duck) was very tasty; the pork chop was a double and very tender. ..I could go on.  My new Charlotte favorite!
