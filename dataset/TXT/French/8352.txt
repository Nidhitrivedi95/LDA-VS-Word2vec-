4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw One of my favourite breakfast dishes is the classic corned beef hash and eggs. Luckily, this meant I was ready to order after seeing the menu at Mon Ami Gabi for literally 3 seconds. Although this was definitely more of a hearty brunch than breakfast, it was exactly what we needed after the afternoon drive into Vegas. The corned beef chunks were perfectly seasoned, eggs properly poached and the buttery potatoes were sufficiently crispy. I also liked the addition of smoky red peppers to this already awesome combination of flavours. I was still avoiding bread like the plague but still found the meal to be supremely satisfying! The restaurant itself is right bang in the middle of the strip opposite the Bellagio, making it optimal for people-watching over a meal. It was absolutely roasting outside, so we opted to sit indoors but the patio area was very tempting. For $15, this was a great shout for reasonably priced AND delicious food in a very touristy area. Overall, highly recommended - hungover or not!
