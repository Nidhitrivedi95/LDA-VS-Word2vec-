SFnrHuVFSNiondFVUBLJZQ Long story short: disappointing. Went here just for a nutella/banana crêpe. Servers were friendly but service was average at best. I had to chase a waitress to place our order and to ask for water as no one ever came to our table initially. The crêpe itself was overpriced and nothing special. The worst part was that there were a ton of spiders in two corners of the restaurant, which was quite disturbing. At one point they started to come down over a couple that eventually moved. One of the waitresses got on top of the tables to swat  all the spiders away while customers were eating - just ridiculous. I say go to Chez Catherine just down the block or Juliette & Chocolat over in Downtown Montréal.
