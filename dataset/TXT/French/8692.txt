4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Too much hype and too many reviews leads to lower in quality of food and service. It's a shame because I can tell that food can be so much better but the kitchen and service staff are probably in a rush to get food ready and turn tables. 

My steak was good but frites were cold. Appetizer came only one minute after ordering which leads me to think that there were a bunch made just ready to serve. 

Perhaps it was because I went during a busy time but if I do go back again, I'll make sure to go when it's not so busy.
