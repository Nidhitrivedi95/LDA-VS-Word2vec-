4O8fzz9F-XEsQ-gTMgkiyQ Perfect meal.  Great atmosphere, nice music, and comfortable seats (and the waiter made sure the table is balanced and not wiggly).  Very good and reasonably priced wine, food was priced for the location but was perfect. We had a bottle of Pinot Grigio, the Risotto for appetizer, the Veggie burger and Spanish Mackerel.   We finished with apple, almonds and caramel ice cream that was perfect.  They even treated us to some nice Sherry. Beautiful outing for two.
