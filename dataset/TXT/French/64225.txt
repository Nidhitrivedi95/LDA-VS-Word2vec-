tCSlpwJQ4CZsUEMZeH2SFg Food was wonderful.  I've had better seating at a McDonald's as they crammed 7 people at a small table for 6 in a crammed corner. We would've enjoyed the food more had we been able to sit comfortably as I had to get the food to my mouth while resting my arm across my husband's chest.  It was also not pleasant being rushed by the wait staff to finish my food so  they could clear the table.  Enjoyed the food but I don't expect we will be back.
