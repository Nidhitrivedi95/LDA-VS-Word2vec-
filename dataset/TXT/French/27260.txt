dd3GZs6zW2t7BM0cbxAzvg After a typical long Monday (hey everyone feels down after the first Monday when the Daylight Saving has ended!) I decided to try this place as they have the Delirium Tremens Beer on tap. I really wanted to try this beer and this place had decent reviews so I decided to give it a try. I went for the Prixe Fix menu which has 3 courses for 32$. I went the escargots, Steak and Creme Brulee'. Escargots were excellent. Nicely Balanced with crisp croutons and just right spinach. Steak was ok and I think the portion was tiny but the fries made the dish better. The Dessert was tiny made with real vanilla beans and topped with Pineapple bits (I think they were too chewy) The beer selection was great so I tried out a bottle in addition to my Delirium Tremens. The place is laid back and I had a nice chat with the couple next too me. We ended up sharing a drink together which is great as the place is not stuffy. 3.5 Stars IMO. Good bistro food if you are looking for one.
