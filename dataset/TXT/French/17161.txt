9ET_RUNztevq4_OLAX80Gg Very underwhelming.  Was excited to try this place after having eatin at the one in nyc. So dissappointing.  Ordered the frenchtoast and heuvos rancheros, which are our go to dishes when out for brunch. Both very poorly executed. The french toast was so dry and unappealing. Sad, really wanted to like this place. Funny, best french toast ive had in this city was at a burger joint! Bareburger
