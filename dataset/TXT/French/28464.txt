EEIz44ewHhOKmfTloAK13g I am so in love with dining here at Alo. You get excellent service, the friendliest and professional staff and orgasmic tasteful small plates by the best chef Patrick Chriss. John is an amazing mixologist and creates sexy but tasteful cocktails. Amanda is as beautiful as the mood she creates for her customers. Chef Chriss is so passionate about craft and love of food that no foodie will walk away without feeling astonished. One of my favorite places to eat in Toronto.
