xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g We'll all I can say is that I was really looking forward to this place which only lead to a colossal disappointment.  Dinner for two was 320 bucks.  Beef Wellington and filet mignon.  Sure it was good but truth be told, if it was 150 bucks and I had no expectations, I would give it four stars.  It tasted fine and the experience was fine. 

For 320 bucks, nobody wants "Fine" therefore I give it only two stars.
