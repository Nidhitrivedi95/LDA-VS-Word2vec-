jLxeBgWhLRbII2ACkgH1Sg I love this place! This chocolate croissants are perfect! I recently had their breakfast sandwich and crepe and I was very happy with it. Check out my pictures of the meal in my blog http://www.lifeismyoyster.com/cafe-saturdays-la-belle-terre/ 

P.S. Their strawberry short cake is very good as well!
