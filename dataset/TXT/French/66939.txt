USleI8g1UVN9-9jm-b4uIg Very good, but didn't quite live up to the hype. To start, the service is exceptional: friendly, super knowledgeable staff who aren't pushy at all. Very laid back, rustic atmosphere as well. The food itself is quite good, albeit just slightly overpriced. The cheese plate was top notch. The elk chop was hyped up so I chose that. It was delicious, but didn't quite meet the expectations I had. Overall, a great experience but again just a bit too pumped up.
