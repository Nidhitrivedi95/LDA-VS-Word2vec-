JFfZDmNAoa_MHG16K2BY6A Went to Loire for a holiday lunch in mid-December with 6 of us from work. Had heard good things but overall it was a letdown. The service was pretty brutal. I think we waited about 15 minutes or even more before they brought water. We had to wait another 15 before they took our order. The server (maybe the owner) was really snooty and looked down his nose at us. Why?

The food was okay but not great. Atmosphere (except for the funky service) was fine. We returned a bottle of wine that was corked and I think that aggravated them but it was super-musty and yucky. Still left a big tip but won't be going back there again.
