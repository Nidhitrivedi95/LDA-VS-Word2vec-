The hostess was welcoming and friendly; sitting at the bar the bartender asked if I wanted a drink and I mentioned about a drink I tried elsewhere to see if he has heard of it. He didnt but offered if I could find the ingredients online he would attempt to make the drink himself. I looked it up on my phone and showed him the ingredients and his version was pretty good as well. Entering the dining area was a surprise as it was a lot smaller then I anticipated. It can make for an intimate dining experience but also falls to increased background noise due to its small size. The table was nice and presented well; the staff seated us and pulled the chairs out as well as placing the napkins on our laps. Dining as a vegetarian for this meal was challenging as the menu did not have many vegetarian choices but the waiter helped out and created vegetarian dishes from what was on the menu. The presentation of all the dishes were good; the food itself was good from the chilled pea soup, to the salad and vegetarian risotto. It just wasnt great; it all tasted good but I was not blown away by it. The desert was probably the best part of the meal as it had a unique presentation and tasted delicious. Overall the dining experience went well, nicely decorated, comfortable seating, good wait staff but I just felt as something was missing that didnt make it a great dining experience.
