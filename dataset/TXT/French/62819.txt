SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ I am putting 4 stars because my lunch was absolutely delicious! I went to lunch yesterday february 26th with a good family friend and I had the roasted chicken sandwich with the pasta salad and he had the Reuben, I think. Sandwich was amazing and I feel the other fellow yelpers were right this place is very tasty :)    However, our service was not up to par AT ALL. He was tall, slender with a dark beard with hints of grey in it..hmm well I was waiting for my guest and ordered a cup of coffee.. so far so good. When my guest finally arrived we waited about 15 minutes until he approached us. He asked what my guest wanted to drink and the minute he said ill just have water and was about to say we are ready to order or waiter was gone. He rushed away, dropped off water and left again! So confused... then when we finally flagged him down he un-enthusiastically recommended some entrees(since we bother have not been there) and that was about it. Not personal at all. No fun! 

Great food, will come back for that but hopefully next time we will have quality service to go along with their quality food!
