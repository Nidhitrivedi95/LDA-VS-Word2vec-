SJo_IjvzdRtCvZVN0cbrRQ Loved my experience here. Went on a Saturday about 10:30 and no wait, however the parking is insufficient.  I ordered a special, french toast/croissant with a hazelnut or coffee/chocolate spread and cherries. Very good and I would order again. Very filling. The coffee hit the spot too, I must have had 2 cups at least. The bacon is the biggest bacon I've ever seen and the 3 others in my group liked their dishes also. The only complaint was before our food came out we requested a side of the potato croquettes and the waitress forgot about them and we did too until after eating. We really wanted to try those! (But gave us a reason to come back, so we can deal with it) I was expecting the bill to be much higher than it was, so I was overall pleased with Bluedoor and would return in a heartbeat.
