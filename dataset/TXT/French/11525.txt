4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw The view  from the restaurant looking into Las Vegas Blvd is fantastic.  The food was okay.  I expected more for the price I was paying.  The experience and attention to detail in the restaurant was A+.  Maybe I just ordered something I didnt like.  Other then the view and service I thought the overall food experience was a solid C.  Three stars from this OC guy.
