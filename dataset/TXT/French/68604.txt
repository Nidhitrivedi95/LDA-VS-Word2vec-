vLkKorA1gPS97Zj0_WKA0Q I loved my dining experience here....every aspect of the meal was first rate. The food, service, and atmosphere all came together to make a truly memorable five star experience. We opted to go with three appetizers and dessert, which I think is the way to go in a place like this because the appetizers are what really stand out on the menu. I had langostine 5 ways, sweetbread, and foie gras 4 ways...so basically i had 12 dishes of food on top of the 5 amue bouches and the dessert. If you order an appetizer like langostine 5 ways...you literally get 5 different plates of langostine placed in front of you...grilled, seared, moussiline, gelee, and tartare. 4/5 were home runs...the weakest was the gelee. The sweetbread ( I LOVE sweetbread) and the foie were great too. dessert was called the "red circle" and was comprised of puff pastry, marzipan, marscapone cream, and one or two other elements I can't recall...but oh boy what a delicious end to the meal. I aked for  wine pairing for each course and the wines were decent, not great. service was efficient and friendly. The setting was very modern and attractive, with a great view from our table by the window. I highly recommend to foodies and people who want to experience something different.
