The bread

The bad:
Everything else. My party got a variety of dishes from the brunch menu and our consensus was that everything was way too salty or drenched in sauces that are too savory. For example in order to mildy offset the flavor of my steak I was eating small slices of steak with several fries, in the end I nearly ran out of fries which covered nearly 3/4ths of my plate

We also got the fried donuts filled with raspberry jelly, the jelly was way overpowering and sour probably 75% of the donut was raspberry filling. I'm shocked this place got 4 stars with over 900 reviews for the price if the bread and service wasn't decent, I'd have given it a single star
