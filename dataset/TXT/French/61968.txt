STX8NfaW_xP6YZq-wERHYg Had a great meal at Chez Nanou Friday night. There were so many yummy sounding options that I'll have to go back soon! It's quite a small space so I would recommend making a reservation as diners tend to linger. 

Pros-
Great selection of charcuterie and French cheeses
Specials highlight seasonal ingredients, fresh and delicious
Espresso 
Amazing deserts

Cons-
Don't go to Chez Nanou if you're in a rush. As long as you enjoy a long relaxing meal and have good company to talk to you'll love it!
