YUFxSG6idHePsxOmnSHtpQ Service was very nice but the food was only ok. Kinda pricey. The pancakes were really good. The meals came out at different Times.  Eggs benedict was terrible.  The egg white breakfast rates great.  The restaurant was not very clean.  The bill was over $45 for three breakfasts. Way to expensive.
