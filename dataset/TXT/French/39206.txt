JsAjP49bCk9KjJmmmjyM4w I'm a dedicated pastry lover who's eaten bakery treats from Beijing to Vienna, Paris, Florence, Montreal and San Francisco. Toronto's offerings invariably leave me cold. Clafouti is no exception.

People, just because it looks like a croissant doesn't mean that it is one. The bread bombs baked up here are neither light, nor buttery, nor flaky. Similarly, their breads have a density I've never encountered anywhere, although when it's made up into one of their sandwiches it's pretty tasty, especially the pate sandwich. I've tried the little tarts and while they look beautiful they aren't so great either. Serving Balzac's coffee is a plus, but ultimately, file Clafouti under overrated.
