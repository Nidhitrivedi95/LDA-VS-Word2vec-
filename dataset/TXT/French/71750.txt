xeFVRUjxorxjO_qjX8FNdw We came here on the late sat night.  This small cafe was packed with people having desserts. 
The waitress is busy but very friendly. 
We had the beef crepe, Wiener Schnitzel, and french onion soup. The crepe is excellent, light and fluffy. The sauce is a little too salty to my tasting. 
Love the Wiener Schnitzel. The fried pork chop is tender and goes really well with the mushroom sauce. 
We got a Toblerone Chocolate Mousse and that is delightful. 
Would def. go back again for more dessert!!
