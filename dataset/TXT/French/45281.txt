mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q Went here for dinner for two. 
For the hype it had and for the price I was paying I had higher expectations of the waiters. I expected them to have more knowledge of the food and be more attentive.. We got the tasting menu 

L'AMUSE-BOUCHE
Foie gras parfait with port wine and parmesan foam - This was one of my favorites .. Absolutely  amazing.. It had promises of an amazing night.. Wonderful.. 

LES LEGUMES
confit of Mediterranean vegetables with fresh mint in a cannelloni - It was good. You have to get a bite of each piece of this dish onyour fork to get the total flavor and that is hard to do. 


LA SAINT-JACQUES
Sea scallop cooked in the shell with chive oil
Soooo goood!!!

*********LES LANGOUSTINES
langoustines cooked in their shells with green curry and coconut milk
AMAZING! This is my favorite dish of the night! Next to the desert of course!  This just melts in your mouth and the explosion of all different flavors are just fantastic.. 

LA CEBETTE
White onion tart with smoked bacon, quail egg "mirror" and green asparagus
Good.. not my favorite.. The asparagus was a bit overpowering 

LA CAILLE
Foie gras stuffed free-range quail with mashed potatoes
 ONE WORD AMAZINGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG !!! 

LE VEAU
Veal flank steak slices with shallot and mashed potatoes
Really good! If you have to choose between the quail and this, go for the quail.


LA FRAISE 
Strawberry compote infused with lime, tequila sorbet
AMAZINGGGGG....  Beyond believe amazing. must have 


LA MURE
Fresh blackberries infused with cassis, tender chocolate cake
OKK... 

Drinks:

Tried three of their specialty cocktails and was not a big fan.. a bit too sweet.
OVER ALL
Great experience . Will I go back again ? Yes  Would rather go next door since it's around the same price ? Yes.. 
Great food.. = )
