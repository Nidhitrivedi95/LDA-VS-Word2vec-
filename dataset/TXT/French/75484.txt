Ycp3Agr7dt71TZkeKV7jng I work across the street from this absolute wet dream of a place so frequent it fairly often for lunches. Personal favourite is the Waldorf wrap (not heated), HOWEVER they have the best peanut butter cookies on the planet. You can get them hot off the presses from early afternoon. Delish.  Lovely staff too. 

They have a good range of sandwiches and it's a good option for salads as well. Especially if you're looking for something fast. 

NOTE: Whenfind yourself awake at 3am wishing you were eating 3 of them in a cookie sandwich (and this will happen) then it's about time you stopped buying the cookies. Yes, stop buying them and start buying the COOKIE DOUGH!!!! They sell it as well and you can make them yourself. I've tried this and they taste just as good.
