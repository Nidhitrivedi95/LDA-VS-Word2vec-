XrOmn4si9IIQig3Yz1X-mw Wow I love it when I find a place really not expecting much but discover it offers much more than you might expect (if that makes sense?!).  We absolutely needed somewhere with a garden or play area to accommodate 5 very active kids and someone suggested Cafe Cassis on Salisbury Road. Most of us mistook it for the big place opposite the Commie Pool but it's at the other end past the Synagogue. 

Anyway, it does have an excellent garden for kids and very welcoming service. Nice layout, small bistro style with a decent Sunday brunch menu (with kids options). Something really good and French going on in the kitchens which makes it a cut above some competitors. Nice Sunday Roast for £9.95, various good lamb, chicken dishes. One issue is very short on veggie options.  I had a really good quality rib eye steak, well cooked and presented, at a decent enough price.  Also good bread and butter pudding (fellow diners enjoyed the cassis sorbet).

Didn't know about this place, bit out of the way but worth a visit, and the garden makes it a real asset in the nice weather (if or when that returns).
