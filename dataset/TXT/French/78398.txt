YVYHX7RCPjCBqEth2CS91Q Bienvenue vers la France!  Brasserie 33 is a very charming Parisian cafe with lots of adoring repeat customers.  If you don't appreciate the appeal and ambiance of that, you should probably stay away.  But this place is quintessentially French with lots of traditional French dishes.  Yes, our waitress slipped in a couple small ways, however it was her first night on the job, and we ended up having a fabulous evening. I ordered the Vol-au-Vent Au Poulet et Champignons for an appetizer, and it was wonderfully dark, rich and savory.  For the main course I had the Cassoulet, which was also marvelous.  I topped off the evening with the Crème Brûlée, and it was prepared as authentically as I have ever tasted it.
