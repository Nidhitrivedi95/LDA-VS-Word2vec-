2B46bRpDh49eDyjXGhL_ZQ Wow!! I highly recommend Chef Maggie to anyone looking to start their day off with a healthy, filling meal.

I am most impressed with the quality of ingredients. Chef Maggie imports all of her flour from France and personally shops for fresh ingredients several times per week. A hand-made meal made in front of me more than exceeded my hopes and filled me up.

And to top it off, she took time from her busy day to share her story. Such a personable and kind person who works hard to make great food. You can hear her passion for what she does.

Take the time to find Chef Maggie and you will walk away full and glad you did!
