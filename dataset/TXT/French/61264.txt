SJo_IjvzdRtCvZVN0cbrRQ The dinner tasting menu was excellent.  55$ for four courses.  I loved the red snapper with mushroom broth.  The cheesecake was also superb.  The risotto and zucchini salad were good.  The place does not feel pretentious but the food is beautifully presented.  If in Cuyahoga Falls this is definitely a worthy dining choice. It worked we all as a dinner pre concert at Blossom but if you do the tasting menu you should have 2 hours at hand.
