RfsMUrGUJdrpfrU54rmEsQ My wife and I ate here last night, 4/15/2016, and it was wonderful. We eat here several times per month and always enjoy the atmosphere and the service. The bruschetta is so delishous and flavorful. It seems I always get the escargot and it never disappoints. For our entree, my wife and I had the Beef Bourguignon special. Oh, it was so good. The beef was cooked well and was very flavorful. The sauce was out of this world tasty, to the point that we were dipping the fries in it to get every last drop. No dessert this night for us but as usual it was another excellent dining experience for us.
