Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA I think everyone should come here for the view. From the outdoor patio of Mix you get a great birds eye view of the Strip. The best time to come if earlier in the evening when its not to crowded and you can enjoy 1 or 2 cocktails. I've heard that on weekends they charge a cover to get in.

The bathrooms here are rather cool as they are surrounded with glass and while your in there you still get to enjoy the view.

Love the glass elevators that you take to come up
