jLxeBgWhLRbII2ACkgH1Sg Been here a couple times now and its definitely on my top five delicious spots in Vegas. 

Croque madam was so rich and delicious.
Baguette sandwich with ham and cheese...holy hell...sweet, crispy, chewy sourdough. Amazing.

Got a bunch of pastries that did not disappoint, especially the cannelle. Had never tried anything like it. Like a little, chewy bread pudding tart. Off the charts. 

Seen a few bad reviews on here, and although I've only been twice, the staff was attentive and informative and I thought the space was super charming and I'm a super fan. 

Now, please excuse me while I eat this quiche.
