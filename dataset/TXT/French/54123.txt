R3uWM4Yyrlz3eifRX4IErw We came to this beautiful little restaurant at July 25 which is my birthday. What I really like about this place is those 80's decorations. 

The food is absolute delicious. I really like how they make their garlic butter go with bread. Besides you won't worry about walking out from this restaurant with three course food but still feel hungry. They have very large portion for their main course. 

In the end thanks the chief for the free Dessert and salad. That was the nicest birthday gift from a stranger.
