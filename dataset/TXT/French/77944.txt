YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g I recently celebrated my 25 wedding anniversary in Las Vegas. My large group and I were set to eat at the Mandalay Bay Buffet, but having eaten there the night before I discovered the food was not up to par. In less than an 10 hours notice I changed plans and we ate here. 

The service was excellent and fast. The food was delicious. I was so happy I changed my mind.  I couldn't imagine a better choice. We even had our own area.
Thanks again for the outstanding job. 

I can't wait to go back.
