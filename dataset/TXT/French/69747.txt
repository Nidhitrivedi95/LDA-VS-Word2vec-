WOd8tWsh2Yt_osHv-ngx_w This was one of, if not the best, eggs benedict I've ever had. I travel a lot for my company and always treat myself to eggs benny. The version I got here was called the Billy Goat which had goat cheese, spinach, capers, and salmon. It was delicious. The homefries were great as well in terms of taste and crispiness, albeit a little salty. The eggs also came with a nice plate of fresh fruit.

The staff was friendly and courteous even though my French is atrocious, haha. They came over several times refilling coffee and water.

The booth I sat in was huge and comfy with a great view of both the televisions inside and the street outside. What a nice place to eat breakfast while traveling.
