sARavfidmIS878q5BtlyVQ This is one hell of an experience. It took me almost 9 months to get a reservation here, but it was well worth it. The taste of the food was not mind blowing for me but the gastronomy (and reconstruction of food) that I experience right in front of my eyes was memorable. I was there with my fiancé and 6 others who I met drinking this dinner. We got lucky that the people on our table were fun and enthusiastic as the experience wouldn't have been the same with quiet people. The room which we dined in was very different and interesting- the decor was supposed to resemble what goes on in Jose Andres's head l. The food tasted pretty good but I wasn't blown away by that. We didn't not do the paired menu which comes with different wines along with each dish. I'm not a wine person so I went with my good old cognac. It was an experience of a lifetime. I don't think I'll go back there again but I would recommend everyone one to at least experience it once in their life.
