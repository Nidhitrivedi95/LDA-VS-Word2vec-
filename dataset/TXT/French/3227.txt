1cGyzWtfOoDiE8V0OR85yA The cafe is relatively small, but was empty when I went on an early Saturday afternoon. The ambience is very laid back and relaxing by. I was recommended the smoked Icelandic salmon with chives and crème fraîche by the cashier. The crepe had a beautiful thin slice of smoked salmon. The crème fraîche really enhances the dish and gives it a nice kick of salty and sour. The mixed green salad came with a vinaigrette and was topped with mandarin oranges. Nothing special per se, but the oranges really do a disservice to the entire salad. It tasted as if they were bathing in a syrup. Other than that, this establishment was wonderful.

I am looking forward to trying their sweet crepes in the future.
