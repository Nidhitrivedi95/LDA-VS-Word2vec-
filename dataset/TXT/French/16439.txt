8_cTFNIWFiDqBQ8MyorQEA We had the blood pudding, Jerusalem artichoke, tahini, brioche, sunny side up egg and braised bacon slab, romano bean ragout, spicy sweet potatoes, poached egg. Both were devious. My preference would be the bacon because it melts in your mouth. Service was pleasant and sweet. Our waiter was very patience with us and explaining everything to us in English. We are from Toronto and don't speak french. I will be returning there again. The menu changes daily.
