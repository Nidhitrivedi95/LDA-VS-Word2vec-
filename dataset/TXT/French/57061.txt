rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A This place was just A-ok

The oysters gave me a little stomachache the next day, but i guess that happens once in awhile when you take a chance with raw food, so that's alright ^_^ That won't keep me away from oysters!

The salmon (don't really remember the name), but it comes in a jar and it has been preserved and was served with toasted baguettes. This was the highlight of the evening. It was super different and mild but with the smoky after taste. Absolutely wonderful.

My bf's trout was just wayyyyyy too buttery! the first bite was super but a couple bites after that pretty much went down hill. It was so rich that it made me and my bf sick to our stomach. Really hard to get it down.

My pork chop was good but the pork was a little tough and I've definitely had better pork chop. NOPA in SF gets it right when it comes to pork chop.

After looking at the dessert menu, we decided to just say "pass" cuz it was nothing out of the ordinary.

So this place is a 3 and no more.
