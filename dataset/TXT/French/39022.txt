jLxeBgWhLRbII2ACkgH1Sg The food was delicious! My only criticism is that the man working the register was less than friendly. He was focused on getting people through the line fast which isn't bad, but it came across as harsh. Beyond that it was a cute, delicious bakery I recommend and will visit again.
