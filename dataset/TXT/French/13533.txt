4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw My wife an I were staying at Caesar's and were starving, but decided that we did not want to eat there, so we went exploring down the strip. We looked outside at the menu, and thought it was okay so we went in.

We were seated outside on Friday around 3:00 PM. Excellent table and excellent view of the Bellagio Fountains. 

We both had a craving for standard fish and chips, so we ordered Gabi's Fish and Frites (at least I believe that's what it was called). I asked the server if this was just regular fish and chips and she said it was.

When our plates arrived, it was not a beer batter like we thought, but a large size grilled cod, without any batter. The fries came in a cone shaped wrapper and were more like shaved fries.

So now onto the eatin'. One thought - OMG, it was superb. The fish had a coconut flavour to it that was just perfect. While the fries were not quite what I expected, they tasted exactly like I wanted. We finished off with a creme brulee which was great.

Would definitely go there again!

NOTE: Gave it $$$ by Vegas strip standards, but it would be $$$$ anywhere else.
