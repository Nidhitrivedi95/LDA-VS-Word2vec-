_cjPEH9wXhKS-HQe_U3M4Q I've been coming here for a while now and food are always top-notch. The atmosphere is French-influenced, and is very nicely decorated. It is very friendly and offers classic French brasserie type foods. If the weather is nice, the outside patio is lovely.

The menu has many universal restaurant fare (i.e. steak, salmon, etc.) as well as authentic French classics. All are well prepared. The steak is well cooked, onion soup is traditional and delicious, and the salmon is superb. The kids menu, if I may add, is one of the best I've seen! The desserts are well proportioned and great for sharing at the end of a filling meal. 

Le Select has a refined, Parisian feel to it and for French food in Toronto, it is quite a noteworthy spot. Service is usually good although I had had a few less than great experiences.
