or4UVDjXEEjze3wNPjoAZA Last night I had the unfortunate experience of choosing this restaurant.  The saying that I learned years ago in the hospitality industry is "don't fight, make it right".  Unfortunately, the manager on this particular evening decided the proper way to deal with poor timing standards from his kitchen is to invite my guest and I to leave and go eat pizza or whatever, somewhere else.  The pizza comment I assume came from the fact that it was already about 8:15pm at this point and well over an hour from the moment we walked through the door.  I suppose that I shouldn't expect better from this manager since I am certain he never once "table touched" our table and I never saw him walk the floor during the hour plus we sat waiting for food.  The truth is that when I went to personally find him, he was camped out in his office.  I tried sincerely to find the owner Terry Ellisor's contact data as I would have preferred to address this personally, but Mr. Ellisor's team is reticent to give out this type of information and it is pretty difficult to discuss such a management issue with the management.  Mr. Ellisor, I invite you to look at your security tapes for July 23rd.
