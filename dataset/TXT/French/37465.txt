j9d1c73emq6sL0v5IfrC-w Three #YelpClubdesVins events and I feel fully eligible to write a happy review for Chez Victoire. 

Definitely five stars wine list. Not your standard one, as an example you can actually try few orange wines if you'd like something different. The wonderful and knowledgeable staff will gladly recommend a wine pairing for your dish. 

Inventive food menu, small dishes full of surprizes. I'm still dreaming about the tuna tataki I had during the first wine event. The menu changes often and that dream hasn't come true again. The price of the plates may be considered as a little bit high for the small portions, but as high is the quality. My last experiment with the menu, Pomme de terre Gabrielle, paired very well with the red from Domaine St-Jacques, local Quebec wine maker. At first glance the dish may look like potatoes covered with egg white, but in reality it is a nice blend of flavours, including black pudding and roasted chipollini. 

The room of the bistro is beatiful, the long bar and tall tables arranged in the middle look like a gorgeous place to be from the private area of the second floor. And did I mention how courteous is the service! Five stars out of six!
