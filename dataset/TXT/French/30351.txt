FRuuIDOd21pTJHvEGIt1Gg It was my second time to visit here and I always order the duck confit as recommended by many and it never fails me every time. It was done by perfection, it was crispy, greasy and together with arugula and potatoes on the side makes it an exceptional meal. I will aways make sure to visit here every time I'm in town.
