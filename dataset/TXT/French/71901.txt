XI3iNUgChOfJk5ppjKVEQQ For our "fancy night out" dinner, we chose Barroco, at the recommendation of a helpful bartender nearby (and yes, we went back for lunch and tipped well to thank her). 

The atmosphere of Barroco grabs you right off the bat.  It's dark.  Not "spooky, lurking figures in the shadows with cudgels" dark, but "appropriately dim and romantic, with candles in all the right places to illuminate just enough to see" dark.  Our server was pleasant and accommodating, with plenty of suggestions, but in the end, I had to try the short ribs, and boy, was I happy with my selection. 

On a trip where I enjoyed pretty much everything I put into my mouth, the short ribs at Barroco were probably up there at the top of the list.  I grow ravenous e'en now as I recall their tender, moist and rich flavor and texture, and while the presentation was a bit slap-dash, I couldn't have really cared less.  I've found a restaurant that competes with Stella for "best short ribs ever", and I don't care who knows it.  

The lovely atmosphere, great food, and helpful waitstaff are all very positive recommendations - though it is a teeny bit more expensive than you might want it to be, as a treat for an out-of-town fancy dinner, Barroco is a great bet.
