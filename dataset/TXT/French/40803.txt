kcF-en40P3J9L8nLy5lKqQ I loved Zen 32 and have been anxiously waiting for Central Bistro to open. I went today with 2 of my dear friends and it was fabulous. The food was wonderful and plentiful, our server was attentive as was the very cute busboy and I loved the atmosphere!  They did an amazing remodel -total renovation. If you were there before you wouldn't recognize the place. The chef even came out to see how we liked it. We all felt like we received the red carpet treatment. I would highly recommend Central Bistro for any occasion - lunch with friends, a romantic evening out., happy hour (which I'm anxious to try and will soon!) or dinner with family and friends. Great place, great food and great people. What more could you ask for!
