xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g We had 5-star views, attentiveness, service and great formal atmosphere. This is one of the places to dress fancy. They had a kids menu -- I'll add a star for that one: just because you have a family does not mean your days of eating at gourmet restaurants is over!

The 5-star dishes: escargot on a creamy sauce on top of a what tasted like a potato cake was heavenly. I'd order that again. Foie gras was what one would expect; melt in your mouth decadence, if you like this sort of thing. This is hard to cook -- as it might melt before your eyes if you try this at home. 

4-star dishes: filet mignon was tender, juicy and simply cooked well.

I don't know what to say about the venison. It was served cold-blood rare, and had the iron-y taste of grass fed beef except 10 times more intense, almost pungent and bitter like arugula on steroids. Other reviews of the venison here on were pleasant. Was this a new recipe? Is this a different species of deer? Was it the charred spice coating? The red cabbage on the side made it worse. The sautéed apples did not redeem it. I had a few bites and did not touch the rest.
