6Hj4AQ5DDGf7tsVk6LscLQ I work and live in Liberty Village. I eat at all the restaurants, atleast once. This place is life changing. I had lunch here the other day ... it used to be another restaurant, but since the renovation it is at the top of my list for places to eat or hang in this neighbourhood. The staff is friendly and helpful..very attentive. The food is THE BOMB!!!!!! I had a duck sandwich with salad and wine. The sauces, the bread, the presentation --- it was well worth it. I really hope people with a brain in their heads go to support this place cause I would hate for it to disappear. That location has always been a challenge in this area, even though it is RIGHT ON THE CORNER of a main street. Super convenient, cozy, and a great spot. LOVE IT.
