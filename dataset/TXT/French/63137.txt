SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA Fantastic dining experience in Cleveland. Great location on Case Western campus. Really pretty. We had dinner on the patio out back since the weather was gorgeous. 

Love that you walk right into the open kitchen. Great decor and design. Loved it!

We started with the cheese course. You must start with the cheese course. We did 5 cheeses and really enjoyed them all. The hard cheeses were our faves.

I had the Duck Confit. Its a French restaurant after all. The duck was crispy and delicious but even better was the sweet potato souffle. That sweet potato side was crazy good. The sweetness of the sweet potato was very subtle. Loved it! My friends had the steak and enjoyed it as well.

it's so refreshing to have great staff. I live in Miami where you pay a premium for attitude. There is nothing nicer than being welcomed into a restaurant by truly nice and attentive people.
