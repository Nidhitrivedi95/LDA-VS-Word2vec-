grHISDkIGwttYthhW8DxCQ Only one complaint: it should close later!

This little breakfast place is sweet and so sweet! Service is very kind! I guessed that encountered the owner who made my breakfast. The prices are really fair! You get big portions of sugary food! Nutella pots everywhere!!! The wait is not very long. Also, there are not that many seats but for the low number of customers when I visited, shouldn't be a problem at all! There are many choices! Keep in mind that it's a small breakfast place, so it may not have the capability to make every dish! Happened to me, he couldn't execute an order I wanted because there wasn't enough ingredient, but it's quite all right! He suggested me another one which was really enjoyable!
