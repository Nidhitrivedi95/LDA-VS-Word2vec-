-4TMQnQJW1yd6NqGRDvAeA if this is the place i recall.. the sangria was way over priced for what it was.   wayyyyyyyy to much ice in it. and the waitress and waiter kept bringing more cups of ice to us.   then one tried to pour some in a cup of ice they brought us and i said ummm no thank you its watered down enough.. then they looked at me like i was crazy and questioned me again why i didnt want it poured in the ice.   was not worth the price whatsoever.  plus there was broken pieces of glass on our table that we kept showing the waitress.
