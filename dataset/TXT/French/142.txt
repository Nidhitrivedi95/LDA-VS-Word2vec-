-4TMQnQJW1yd6NqGRDvAeA Never got to the food. We (2) were seated next to a party of 8 when the place was 80% empty. It was so tight, we had to shift the chairs for the wait staff to get through. Asked the young hostess and she said she couldn't move us as the front garden was reserved for 3pm Valantine's Day folks. It was 12:50pm.  Meanwhile, the waiter was pantomiming the words "No" and making a slashing sign with his hand past his throat to the Hostess. Apparently, he didn't want her to move us.  All this while standing behind my wife, not realizing I saw it all. Some customer service training/reasonable accomodation response is highly in order. Good bye. Too bad, other trips there were very good experiences the past few years.
