4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Since my parents are currently in Vegas on a business/leisure trip, I thought I would do a couple of reviews on some of my favorite restaurants I've visited when I was there a couple of years ago. These reviews may not be entirely accurate in comparison to today's current reviews, but nevertheless, they seem to fall well in line with most opinions on this site. 

Oh, Mon Ami Gabi, you are the closest thing to a bistro in Montreal, Quebec City, or heck, even Paris I've gotten to in awhile. I've dined at bistros in all 3 francophone cities, but I have to say, Mon Ami Gabi does a really decent job for being an Americanized French bistro. Plus, the waiters are a ton nicer than you would find in Paris so you don't feel as guilty about the pricetag because you know the level of service equals the quality of the food. I had steak roquefort, and loved the thin cut frites! If you do have an appetizer, go with the fruit and cheese platter. There were some cheeses I hadn't had before like a Belletoile. My parents enjoyed the wine selection from what I can recall as well. The prices were actually pretty excellent in comparison to other super expensive Vegas restaurants, so I felt like it was well-spent here. If it isn't too busy, ask to be seated in the glass interior patio area facing the Bellagio fountains.
