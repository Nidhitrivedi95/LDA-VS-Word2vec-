The staff were well versed in their menu and attentive without the constant stream of "how is everything" that is often passed off for good service.  And the night view of Las Vegas from the 64th floor was amazing.

Yet the real star was the food.  Each item at our table  was perfect.  And while this is certainly cheap dining, it stacks up very nicely to more expensive options in the area.

I will definitely revisit on future trips.
