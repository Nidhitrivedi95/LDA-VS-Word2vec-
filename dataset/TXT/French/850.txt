_cjPEH9wXhKS-HQe_U3M4Q Atmosphere: Parisian, beautiful music, friendly staff, nice decor 

Food: exquisite!! Finely done in a high end fashion. Great menu selection. I had the salmon croissant with cream cheese and cucumber which was wonderful for the summer. Along with freshly squeezed orange juice.   The hash browns are crispy on the outside and perfect on the inside. 


Will definitely be back for more brunch in the future. One thing I noticed was that even though it is a quality  high end restaurant, the customers were laid back in their attire. This kept the place humble.
