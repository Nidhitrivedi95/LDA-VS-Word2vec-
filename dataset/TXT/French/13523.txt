4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I have been here twice already.  My cousins used to always rave about this place and now I know why.  

First time I came, I ordered the filet mignon with merlot butter.  It was cooked to perfection.  I recently came back and ordered the hangar steak cooked medium.  At first, I ordered medium well and the server informed me that it may be a little tough and recommended that I have it cooked medium.  I'm so glad I listened to him because it came out perfect!  I'm not a big fan of the French fries that the filet mignon and hangar steak comes with but they sure are addicting!  Don't forget to ask for extra merlot butter!  YUM!!

We came in a big group last time and were able to accommodate us all.  But make sure everyone in your group is present or they will not seat you!

Also, my sister and cousin had ordered the fish of the day w/rice (pilaf?).  The servers had erroneously brought out fish & chips for them both.  They told the waiter that they did not order that.  The waiters immediately took back the order.  Another waiter had come out to apologize for the mistake and their food came out in less than 10 minutes!  Even though they had to wait a little longer, I liked the fact that the waiter was apologetic and brought out their food in a timely manner.  They didn't have to wait too long to eat with the rest of the party.

Service and food are excellent here and I would frequent this spot more if I was closer!  Prices are also decent.  Highly recommended!
