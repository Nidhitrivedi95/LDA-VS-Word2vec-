1idRJwqXxxmgSyQRKag4KQ Started with a lobster bisque. The soup was ok but it came with a really delicious shrimp. Best shrimp I've ever had. Got the escargots as appertizer. it was not bad.
Got the duck and lamb for entree. Both were yummy.
Ordered both vanilla and chocolate souffle. Kinda dissapointed with the souffle. It was good but just not as good as expected.
