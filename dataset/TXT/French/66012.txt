udFcIcbWbxrO8uLF95WnQg A group of my friends and I went here last night for my birthday. We had a fabulous time! Our waitress, Amy, was funny and attentive, and her service was on point. She also gave some great wine suggestions for our meals. We started off with some appetizers (cheeseboard was a fun adventure, the seafood dumplings that were to die for, crispy pork stack, and butternut squash ravioli). The apps were great and plenty enough for everyone to share! Dinner was great too! Everyone enjoyed their meals. I got the rabbit gnocchi and was a little disappointed, because it seemed on the salty side. But it didn't ruin the meal, and I just know to get something else next time. I was also impressed by the fact that the manager came several times to see how we were doing. Also, they put a candle in my dessert because they knew it was my birthday- a nice touch. 

Overall, it was great and my friends (all of whom are on the pickier side, and from out of town) raved about it the entire night. I was definitely pleased and will be going back!
