What a fancy breakfast. It was pricey and you don't get a lot for your money but I was surprisingly full when I left. I got the breakfast sandwich. $9 for just the sandwich-man it was delicious flavors though and the croissant was the best I've ever had. Definitely could split that and something else with someone so you don't get sick of the flavors. The side of potatoes ($4) not worth it, so tiny. Mom got the cherry Danish -guys this thing was HEAVEN and big!!!!! It tasted like fresh cherry custard in the middle and it was only $3-that was the most reasonable item we ordered so we may just return and get a bunch of bakery items to go, maybe even at the drive up window (which is awesome). 

Bottom line: couldn't be a weekly breakfast spot due to price but is a nice place to take your mom or a guest in town visiting. Will stop by and pick up some bakery if in the area.
