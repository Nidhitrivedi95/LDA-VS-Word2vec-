P6O50VeFlBIJpP0QPYsXbQ Just ate at Guy Savoy post a show at Ceasars with a party of four and cannot recommend this place enough. 

Be warned the bill is going to be as stunning as the food, but I can say for a special occasion in Vegas it is really hard to beat this place. 

The food is outstanding and we really liked the minimalist decor and intimate setting (a nice break from Vegas glitz), but where this place shines in my opinion is the service. Without question, we were attended to by the one of the best head waiters that I have experienced in my dining experiences. 

He really did a great job of managing the presentation and flow our meal, was incredibly knowledgeable and witty about selections and really went out of his way to make us feel comfortable and special. As a highlight, he deftly handled the selection of a fantastic french red after I made it clear I did not want to spend close the bottle average on a seemingly limitless and intimidating selection. 

If your ordering a la carte I recommend not to miss the sea bass or artichoke hearts/black truffle soup.
