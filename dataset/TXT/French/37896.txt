jaSowNITPRRCYpPb3_pjdA Went last Saturday for a spur of the moment brunch.  The service was very good, you could tell he came from fine dining. Bloody Mary was not my favorite, and over priced in a small glass, I would prefer a better recipe.  We had the Vegetable Quiche - awesome  - light fluffy  very good!  and the Brioche French Toast, also a hit!  We were first in as they opened so everyone was on point. The server offered the Beignets as a complimentary sample from the chef - they were super!  I will be calling to order a dozen for pick up!  It is not two $$  three for sure, but worth it.    I would go back!
