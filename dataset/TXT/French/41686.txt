klzCMxmhrHWZeNseS4GKFg The best dinner we had and on our recent trip to Edinburgh and we had some good ones. This intimate restaurant fills up quickly because everyone there from the out-of-towners like us as well as the locals get to enjoy the food that is prepared with care. Definitely call ahead to get a booking. You'll risk waiting awhile or not getting a table at all just dropping in. They take children which was a plus for us.
