A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g I read about Patisserie Manon within a Yelp review. The first time I went there, I went for the macarons which were so amazing, flavorful, delicate and reasonably priced ($1.10 a piece) that I squealed like a four-year-old and had to order almost one of each flavor.  All were chewy on the outside, creamy on the inside and bursting with intense, fresh flavors. Although I love them all, try the salted caramel macarons, they are magical. Until Manon, I always went all the way from my home in North Las Vegas, to Bouchon in the Venetian for my pastries.

One day for lunch, I had Manon's special, which for me was the French onion soup and the goat cheese quiche. The soup was delicious and the quiche was delicate and tender. I bought an almond croissant to take home. It was one of the best I'd ever tasted. I've been to Paris and I must say that these flavors took me there again.

Most of staff was friendly and knowledgeable. I very highly recommend them. I will return again and again, hungry for more!
