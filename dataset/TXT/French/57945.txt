rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Holy cow, what a great meal. From start to finish, everything was great. Service AND food. Our waiter was awesome, so were the people helping him out - I don't remember names, but they were working table 804 around 6:30pm on Saturday, Feb 20th. Service was very attentive, and very personable. We had some oysters (a mix of east and west coast, great choice, by the way), the steak frites and a brownie dessert. Everything was prepared perfectly and tasted excellent. We were able to sit outside, which was also great - beautiful view from our table!
