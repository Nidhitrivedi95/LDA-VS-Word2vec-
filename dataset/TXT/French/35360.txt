Ht-_i0UAq7YDBaqJwcQMdQ Went with some out of town friends who all loved it and are still raving about the experience. 
The service was very good - they adjusted the menu for two members of our group and gave lots of very helpful tips. Nice atmosphere. The food was wonderful.  We each tried something different, with a few of us having two appetizers instead of a main meal and still feeling like we had more than enough food. I had the scallops followed by risotto, both of which I would not hesitate to have again.
