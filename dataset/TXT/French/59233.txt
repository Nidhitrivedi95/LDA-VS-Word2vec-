rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w Last minute invite ~Date~ to attend a friends daughters wedding. My friend told me, we were staying at the Bellagio and had made reservations at Le Cirque restaurant. I loved French Foods. It was my first time eating there too. First, the atmosphere was very pleasant and classy. . Immerse ourselves in a jubilant showing of brilliant colors. We had a romantic dinner for two in a very intimate setting. All the food on the menu was to die for. I had a very light dinner yesterday evening. I highly recommend staying and having dinner at the Bellagio. Five Stars for me. Just got home from the airport. Tired! Tired!  Bedtime for me!
