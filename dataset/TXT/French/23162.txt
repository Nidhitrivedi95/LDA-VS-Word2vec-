C3PK_1n4xHuC3eCo_azYgw So sad to see this place closed!  Seriously the best sandwiches in Montreal.  You walk in, the line moves fast, there's a team of three guys in an assembly line and they have it DOWN so your sandwich is literally ready in 11 seconds.  If you're a regular they'll have your sandwich in your hand by the time you've done placing your order.  There's one more guy constantly bringing fresh baked bread from the back room.  The deli meat tastes perfect with the mayo mustard combo they put on there.  And so cheap!  Dang I miss this place.  I can't even recommend any alternatives for it.
