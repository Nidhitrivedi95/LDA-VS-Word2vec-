hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA Great and affordable brunch 

The pesto. Flavorful but could be more pronounced. 

The blue brie.  Great proportion of cheese mushrooms and bread with the hint of apple than refresh the melting feeling. 

Egg baguette is very basic,  matching its price 

Bread is above average but nothing great 

Great find
