WOj8nPos3R9IIf0Pyttd8g Dinner tonight with family from out of town.  Great atmosphere, wonderful food.  Service was excellent, even with a pre-theater crowd and our table of nine.  The fried green tomatoes with country ham are top notch - could make a meal out of those and the calamari alone.  Main courses were - as always - the best.  

This is a great spot in Plaza-Midwood, where we always have a fantastic experience - whether its brunch, lunch or dinner.
