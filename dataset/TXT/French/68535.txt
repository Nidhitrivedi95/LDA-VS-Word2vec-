vLkKorA1gPS97Zj0_WKA0Q We were recently treated to an extraordinary evening here. The restaurant is absolutely gorgeous. We had a corner table overlooking the lights of Las Vegas Blvd. It is easy to feel on top of the world here. 

Our service team was led by Sunday. He is gracious, knowledgeable, and a consummate professional in his craft. Our evening was scheduled for us ahead of time with each course personally selected by the chef. Sunday was the perfect conductor for the show. 

I have included several pictures to show the beauty of a few of the plates. (Not all photos came out well.) These photos only do partial justice to the overall experience. 

The tastes were nothing short of divine. I had over 27 years in the culinary arts and am a culinary graduate myself. I told Sunday that throughout my career I tried several dishes worldwide that often elicited an emotional response to their perfection. Twist offered a side dish with one entree that brought a physical reaction like I've never felt. It was a simple potato side dish that sent a chill over my entire body. Quite exquisite to say the least. 

Do yourselves a favor and go to this restaurant. I guarantee you will be very excited that you did. My wife and I will absolutely return on our next visit to LV and are eager to spend another evening with our new friend Sunday.
