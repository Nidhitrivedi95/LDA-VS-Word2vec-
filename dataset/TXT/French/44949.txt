mT8Ej8sKFJoIa5G0Vl4AKA Baton Rouge has the best ribs ever! These mouth watering ribs fall off the bone. They are cooked over night, and basted with the sauce. You will never forget ribs like this. The Louisiana BBQ Chicken is another favourite if you are not in the mood for ribs.

Has an appetizer the homemade spinach dip is amazing and can be a meal, so try not to overdose on it no matter how addicting it is!
