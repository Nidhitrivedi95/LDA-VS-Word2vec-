SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ Had reservations and were running a little late due to traffic from the football game - the hosts were totally understanding and helpful as far as where to park. The menu is great along with the atmosphere. I had the Boar - phenomenal! Our server seemed to have good energy at first but then seemed to become very annoyed and eager to get us out - there was no wait and he also had other tables. We asked for him to divide the check and he became very aggravated and said that he couldn't do so.
