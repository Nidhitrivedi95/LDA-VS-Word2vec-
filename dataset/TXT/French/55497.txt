rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A After watching a Cirque show, my bf and I came here for a late dinner. Nice ambience, a very cute but typical French bistro.

Complimentary warm pistachio and cold bread, bread was alright, thought they could do better.
Split a mixed green salad with goad cheese and red wine vinaigrette, I like how the dressing wasn't too overpowering, the cheese was really good with the bread.
The man had steak frites (by default). Fries were plentiful and cooked just right, crispy and not oily. Steak was great, but because it is Thomas Keller, we thought there should be a wow factor.
I had the leg of lamb. It was very delicious, cooked right and very tasty.  I love the crispy cake-like thingy that came with it. 
Dessert was lemon tart, it was yummy. 

Glad that we tried the restaurant, maybe we will come back for brunch next time.
