FUX9h1a37GJn9ge1baiNuw A little bit--no, a lot--of France right here in Madison. This bakery and coffeeshop draws a crowd of croissant munchers and espresso sippers for a reason. The bakery is quality, and best of all, very fresh. Come early or your choices will be limited. The chocolate croissant tastes just the way one should, and their quiches are FAB. The staff behind the counter speaks French amongst themselves between taking orders, so I'd say authenticity is a check! There are about 8 tables in the cafe, so if you want to stay for a while, be prepared to wait during early and lunch hours. But once you've got a spot, it'd be easy to sip and chat for hours as the French do is this perfect patisserie.
