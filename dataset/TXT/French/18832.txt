aM4pb4teV2Tr0Z-ZRt4icg We've been to this quaint cafe a few times. Every time we've been greeted with a smile and always courteous service. Good Nespresso coffee and macarons. Delicious chocolates and freshly made crepes! Croissants are wonderful - buttery & flaky!!! We have not tried the gelato yet because we love good coffee and desserts.
