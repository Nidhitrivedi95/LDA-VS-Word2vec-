O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q Visited the restaurant for a quick bite just after our check-in at The Palazzo. The bar offers a great selection of wine and other spirits. The appetizers were really good calamari with a side of spicy marinara sauce were really good. But the star of the show was the cheese and meat spread, ridiculous!!! Delicatessen, good quality cheese, cold cuts, olives, bread, pickles and many other really tasty small bites. 

From 12 pm to 1 pm on weekends they have happy hour buy one get two, this special only applies to some of their cocktails and beers, not for top-shelf drinks. They also offer a very extensive selection of bourbons and whiskeys.
