eff all that 'authentic' jazz. I don't particularly care if my bowl of Gazpacho is not traditionally French, it was DEE-LISH. As were my mussels, the steak frites, and the scallops. 

VERY well priced for the Strip; a classy little eatery. Total win, both for service and food. I could eat here for days. Yes, days.
