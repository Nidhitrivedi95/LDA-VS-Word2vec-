SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA I first came here when I was interviewing for a job in Cleveland and have been back regularly since I moved here.  The food and drink are superb and the service is excellent. The outside area is very nice in the summer and the bar inside is nice for a quick dinner and glass of wine.  I highly recommend their arugula salad!
