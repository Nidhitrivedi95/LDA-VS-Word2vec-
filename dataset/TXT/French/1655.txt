0d6kx6Jlocw77y1J9nbqMA I've been a devout fan of Scratch since it's opening.  Duc, the owner, is extremely down-to-earth, and is eager to serve good, quality food.  The delectable, eye-catching pastries are almost too perfect to eat, and the quality of them rival if not exceed any pastry I've had in Paris.  You cannot go wrong with breakfast or lunch.  My faves are the goat cheese and spinach crepes, foie gras and caramelized onion sandwich, and the quiche lorraine.  Do not pass up trying the hot chocolate!  This is authentic drinking chocolate with a hint of cinnamon - far superior to the famous Angelina's in Paris.  Though I am not a huge macaroon fan, I must say that Scratch's macaroons are divine.
