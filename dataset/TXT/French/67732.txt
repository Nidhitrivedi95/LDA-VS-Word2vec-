UxWH8zRYIBgs6Q2oykvRdw Very good ambience.  The decorations are ornate and complex, tables, chairs, space - everything is done in excruciating detail to mimic a high-end place in Quebec.  I am sure American tourists are very impressed. 

The wine list is extensive (and expensive), but I opted for beer.  Sacrilege, I know.  I started with the Onion soup and my girlfriend with salad.  The Onion soup was probably in the top 3 I've ever had, hands down, in Toronto, Quebec or France, amazing and the cheese on top was actually top-shelf - you could taste it.  

Then we had Baked Sauvagine for 2 to share, and it looked small initially, but man was it filling!  My gf gave up after a few bites, so I had to finish the monster - talk about stomach overload.  The amount of fat in that thing must have been incredible - and it tasted every bit as marvelous.  

Overall a great place for French food in a great ambiance with an emphasis more on the ambiance than the food.
