gjCmXkMNVE0JSk8puUwv6g I would give this place a 3.5 out of 5 but we can't do half stars lol. This place has good potential considering it is a health conscious spot with quality ingredients and the presentations are on point. Unfortunately there were a few flaws within my meal. I started with the broccomole which is their take on guacamole but made with broccoli. It was really clean and delicious served with some semi stale tortilla chips. I got the tuna Niçoise salad which came with a very subtle tasting dijon dressing that was a bit too thick but it did pair well with the salad. All in all it was very good and I would order it again. For my entree I got the chicken with pea purée. The chicken was kinda bland but it's saving grace was the purée because it was delicious and gave it flavor. The sauce or reduction got hardened before it got to my table so it was disappointing that I couldn't really try it. There were also some pieces of pancetta on the plate and I don't remember seeing it in the description which sucks since I don't eat pork :/ I just set it aside. I love their concept on healthy, clean eating. The presentation looked great on everything I got and I can appreciate all the fresh ingredients but I had better expectations. I spent about 35 and tipped 5 and I feel like my meal wasn't worth  40 bucks with all the flaws. I'm sad I didn't spend it on ayce sushi lol.
