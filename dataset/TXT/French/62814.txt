SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ Very good food with reasonable lunch menu prices.  The dinner menu is a little more expensive.  I love having lunch on their out door patio because it makes you feel like you aren't in AZ or even close to a college campus.  The atmosphere is relaxing and very quaint.  Last time I was there, I had their quiche and soup.  It was very good.  I don't think I've been there and had something I didn't like.  The service is quick and the waiters have always been helpful and polite.
