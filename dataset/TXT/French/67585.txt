UxWH8zRYIBgs6Q2oykvRdw I've been wanting to try Cluny for quite a long time and finally today got a chance to try it. I got HIGH expectations for this place but blah. You think with the amount of money you spend here you'll get an great customer service experience but no. One of the woman who looked like a supervisor ignored us and treated us poorly. Then we bought around 4 of their pastries they didn't offer us a paperbag to carry, and the girl just walked away doing something else. Food is good but their customer service is not. Will never go back again.
