mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q Wow, the food is just amazing! But if you are a big eater, you might have to stop somewhere for some food later because the portions are very tiny but there is no word to describe the dishes. I did think it was overpriced because I have been to 5 stars places before and I didn't quite spend 1/3 of what we spent there. I would not spend over 800 for a dinner for 2 again. It was just a great experience.
