A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g BEST macaron place EVER!!!  Plus they are ONLY $1 each!!!
I am macaron obsessed and have had my share of eating macarons in various locations throughout Los Angeles and Las Vegas.
This place is absolute heaven in your mouth!

Hubby and I tried vanilla, peanut butter, pistachio, blueberry, cherry, and chocolate mint.  Our faves were the chocolate mint and peanut butter.  Vanilla and cherry were also very good.  Blueberry and pistachio were just okay but still good.

Can't wait to return and try the other flavors and the other pastries/ desserts looked just as deelish!!!
