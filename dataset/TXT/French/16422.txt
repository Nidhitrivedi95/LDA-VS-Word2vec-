8-UimW8awULAZWuKUq9nKg We were the first couple to arrive of a party of 10.  The maitre-d' looked at us, nodded towards to the table and told us to seat ourselves.  Equally rude was the waiter who actually rolled his eyes at people who couldn't decide what to eat, and who got in a shouting match with one couple over whether a steak cooked 'medium' had any red in it.

On top of that, the two people that ordered the sea bass were treated not only to some cheaper, tasteless fish in the guise of a bass but both were sick that night.

I would highly recommend never going to this restaurant.
