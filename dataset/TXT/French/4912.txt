33Tr0eRki1Yamzleu4GMdw What a cute bakery and café! I wish I had this bakery in my part of town. The inside is decorated nicely to fit the French theme. The dining room was clean and looked like a nice spot to hang out for awhile. I stopped in one Saturday after eating lunch in the area so I can only speak to the coffee and baked goods....for now. 

The coffee and tea menu offers a nice variety of options. Tea flavors are nicely displayed on the counter and coffees are listed out on the menu over the register. The latte menu has some special flavors for those with a sweet tooth. I went for the Crème Brulee Latte and enjoyed it very much.

The baked goods all looked for very good, but I used self control and narrowed to two items. The Pistachio Macaron had a great flavor and texture. It was the perfect size for a sweet bite with my latte. The Almond Tart had a nice flaky crust and a well flavored almond taste inside of the tart. I enjoyed both of the baked goods very much.

I'll definitely be back for breakfast or lunch. Who can pass on quiche?
