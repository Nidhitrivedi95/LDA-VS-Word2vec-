mr4FiPaXTWlJ3qGzp4-7Yg We went here for Mother's Day brunch.  I had a very good egg omelette with guacamole and my wife had the French toast. Very nice intimate setting and the menu has very nice choices.  We got our son a fresh berry yogurt which I ended up eating most of it because it was so good. My son was still quite happy regardless. We will definitely be back to claim our check in deal but that is not what would bring us back. The exciting dinner menu is why we will be back soon.
