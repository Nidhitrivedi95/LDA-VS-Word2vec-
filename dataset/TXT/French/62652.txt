SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ The food was absolutely fabulous, but our waitress (Jen) forgot several things (she forgot our drinks twice and even forgot our entrees). Interestingly enough, the other waitstaff stepped in and covered for her absences, which was impressive. I will absolutely return for the food, but hope that the next waitstaff has better focus.
