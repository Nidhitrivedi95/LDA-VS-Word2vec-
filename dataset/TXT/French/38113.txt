JezHN-9KKLTMbojq00VP0g Food was great. The service was OK but I see everybody was running around working hard so maybe they were short staffed. All friendly.
The food was yummy. They have things for ( really yummy things) grandmother to little kids. 
A lot of selection and it was so hard to only pick one dish. 
I hope to go back and try the others I cannot eat.
