4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw We stumbled upon Mon Ami Gabi on our last day in Vegas as we were looking for one last meal before the long flight home.  Well, sorry for the pun, but we hit the "Jackpot".  This place was awesome.  It was a hot day, but not a super hot Vegas day and we wanted to sit outside.  Only one spot was available to sit outside and it didn't have an umbrella so the hostess quickly snatched us a spot in the sun room.  You get the best of both worlds as you get to technically sit inside with the AC, but also have open doors to the Strip right in front of you.

The food was very good and made me feel like I was back in France.  We started with the Baked Goat Cheese Hors D'oeuvre and it's a very healthy portion.  For our entree we went with the Trout Almondine and the Bordelaise Steak Frites.  Both entree's were very good and left us feeling very full and satisfied before we headed to the airport.  

In addition to the great food is the great service.  Very attentive, helpful and friendly.  My wife and I can't wait to take our friends to Mon Ami Gabi the next time we are back in town.
