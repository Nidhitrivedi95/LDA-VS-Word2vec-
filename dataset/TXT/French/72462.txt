XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q Best of Vegas. We came here to celebrate our friend's birthday and had the full tasting menu. I remember food was delicious and well presented, chef also brought out a cake with candles in the end. Service was very attentive; ambient was elegant - right up my alley! Because I started drinking from the morning...(it's Vegas), I couldn't remember each course we had clearly, but overall I remember I had a fantastic dinner. Would love to come back again!
