4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Since my travel companion and I were the only people dysfunctional enough to be wide awake (and starving) at 7am on the Las Vegas Strip, we decided to take advantage of the situation and have a power-breakfast at Mon Ami Gabi -- a spot that's notorious for endless lines and waits for those foolish enough to show up without a reservation.

My instinct was right:  At 7am on Saturday morning, the restaurant was empty, and the two of us had our choice of tables with no need for reservations or waiting.  It also helped that the morning was glorious -- 70F, a gentle breeze, and perfect for leisurely meal on Mon Ami Gabi's sprawling patio, right on the Strip and across from Lake Bellagio.  (Sadly, the fountain show isn't running at 7am, but there's always abundant people-watching.)

I'm not a caffeine person, but mornings in Vegas require it.  A pot of black tea for me and endless refills of black coffee for my guest were just what the doctor ordered.

The portions at Mon Ami Gabi are behemoth, so we knew that one small plate and one regular plate would be more than enough food.  We started with the fruit salad with brown sugar and yogurt, which was simple but fresh and tasty.  We also shared the turkey and egg white omelet, which is served with toast (+ butter and jam), hash brown, cherry tomatoes, and avocado.  The omelet was certainly pretty to look at, but a bit bland.  It needed pepper, or hot sauce, or something to give it a little kick.

The real winner, surprisingly, was the hash brown.  I don't think I've ever had one so crispy and flavorful.  I say this as someone who normally shies away from heavy, carb-laden breakfasts.

Service at Mon Ami Gabi is....typical Vegas.  Stiff and not especially friendly.  I don't  expect much else at a restaurant that probably gets zero regulars.

That said, I think I know exactly where I'm headed next time I need a tasty, healthy, and relatively affordable breakfast on the Strip!  =)
