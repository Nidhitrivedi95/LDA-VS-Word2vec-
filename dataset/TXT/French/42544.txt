LHwzyN5cllTfLuZ8v2k_Bg You might as well know right away that the servers are not going to charm you. These are not college kids hoping to ingratiate themselves in exchange for a generous tip. These are professional servers and you really shouldn't waste their time with questions about the food - and don't even think about asking for ketchup for the frites (we didn't).

So, with that knowledge, you should know that you will want to come again and again despite the brusque service - or is it french service - or is it both? Anyway, you will want to come again because ooh la la, la cuisine c'est bon! Every morsel of it is splendid. And those servers indifferent to making a positive impression on you with friendly chit chat will ensure that nothing distracts you from enjoying the perfect meal perfectly served. 

Make reservations because it fills up fast. Bring a thick skin.
