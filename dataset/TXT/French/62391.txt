SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ I really like House of Tricks on my first trip. We stopped here after a client work day for drinks and apps. 

Staff was very attentive, food was really good, and the outside seating was upscale, yet casual. Not sure how they did that, but it worked! 

When in Tempe, I will definitely come here again!
