cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg I dine at APDC just about every time I visit Montreal, which is often but have found little to add to the excellent reviews posted on Yelp.....
Until now.
 It strikes me that after all these years of a packed house every day and a unchanged menu that APDC would have "shot it's load" years ago but no....the standards and specials are as current, and delicious as ever and service ,while casual, is still friendly,helpful and efficient .
I love the mix of diners and vibe here,typically Quebecois in it's languid pace and joyous celebration of good food,drink and company.
We tend to get an early reservation to allow for all the fatty and heavy dishes to digest and then stroll around St Denis and mingle with all the beautiful people.

A truly great dining experience.......every time.
