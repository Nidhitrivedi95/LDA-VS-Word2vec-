JsAjP49bCk9KjJmmmjyM4w I first came to this place for the crookie, but now I keep coming back for the bread and croissants.

My favorite is the muesli bread which is delicious! It also has raisins in it too! I've also tried the olive foccacia, which was also delicious and smelled fantastic but man the paper bag was like so oily.

The almond croissant are my favorite, they cut a big croissant in half and then put this almond paste in the middle like a sandwich.

The one thing I'd say is they kinda cool. The don't give too much emotion whenever I'm there. Gimme some pleasantries.

With that said, I'll still come back for their bread and croissants!
