0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g I did expect the price to be unreasonably high, but I dared to take the plunge and sought incredibly delicious fancy schmancy food at Picasso.   Too bad the food sucked.

What I liked:
The window and outside seating have a great view of the Bellagio Lake fountain show.
The service was polite and attentive.
The Poached Oysters were tasty (and the only item that I liked).

What I didn't like & why I will not return:
The story: The menu has only 2 fixed price courses (WE DID BOTH, so we tasted most of the main course items offered on the menu).  In course #1 you can make a choice out of two options for both the final course plate and desert.  In course #2 you can make a few more choices.  Most of the items were just OK: timid Lobster Salad, one scallop on mashed potato and gravy (weird), and underwhelming lamb chops.  How about that Roasted Pigeon?  I've had more exciting Peking Duck at Chinese restaurants.

The short: The food was all image and no flavor.  The Foie Gras was especially disgusting; every bite was like an explosion of greasy fat.  Remember walking at the park with all those geese?  The Foie Gras is the liver from those little pooping guys.

Other notes:
The food is really rich, even though the portions look fairly small, and a full course is more than enough food for one person.
The ladies will get a complimentary small box of desserts.
The French dining experience is typically long and relaxed, so don't go here if you only have 1 hour to eat.

The photos of the food look cool, but what were you positive reviewers thinking?  However, it is possible on the night I visited the chefs were replaced by raving circus midgets.
