6fPQJq4f_yiq1NHn0fd11Q We stopped by here at the recommendation of the elevator operator at the Eiffel Tower...and glad we did (despite being a little full from an earlier breakfast.) We shared a massive cinnamon bun crepe and loved every bite! Ours didn't seem to have too much filling as an earlier post mentioned... it was just enough! They are huge, so definitely get one to share! Plenty of seating and quickly made. If we ever find our way back - will absolutely stop by again!
