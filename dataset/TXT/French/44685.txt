mnn--vaYHtNyBNYFYBFIog OVERRATED,presentation does not mean good food!

I finally got the chance to try the apparently best restaurant in Canada according to many people and reviews. I got lucky and got a reservation for a 9 pm evening. It was a special menu because it was Montreal a table week.

Carpaccio de cerf de Boileau: The deer meat was fresh obviously, but the combination of flavors of the nuts with the beef was not working that much for me.

Rillettes de bar rayé: This one was a bit better, mustard crispy part mix with the fish, good flavors

We decided we wanted to try all the main course, and the waited was nice enough to get me and my friend half portions of the gnocchi. I enjoyed this dish, the gnocchi were different than the typical, they mixed it with some sort of nut or something. There was a 40$ add-on for this plate though.  

The Iceland cod was perfectly cooked a flaky beautiful fish and tasted pretty good with a side of squash puree and some potatoes.

My friend took the porc tenderloin, I tried a bit and it was a bit dry and the sauce wasn't anything special.

The desserts, once again presentation is nice but wasn't anything out of this world.

Conclusion, the place is absolutlely not the best restaurant in CANADA. Service was descent, but the most important part is the food, and it did not impress me at for 150$ per person, you can find way better!
