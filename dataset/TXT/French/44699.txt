mnn--vaYHtNyBNYFYBFIog The tasting menu is really the most amazing thing ever. The food was delicious, the wine paring fantastic. The restaurant is elegant in a non-stuffy way. 
I honestly cannot pick what the best dish was because everything was really good. it is really an experience coming to this restaurant, we stayed for about 4 hours. Highly recommend it!
