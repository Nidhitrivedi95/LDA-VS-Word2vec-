AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw Inside Caesar's Palace this little French Patisserie is great for coffee with a pastry, macaroon, or crepe. Although the pastries are very tasty (such as almond croissant) the seating arrangement is problematic. You cannot fit anything other than couple of drinks to the tiny tables. If you got a plate, I meant a plastic to go box, than you better take it to your room. 

In short, food is delicious, but better stick to coffee & croissant if you want sit there. 

There is also a restaurant seating section to order food, but I did not try it.
