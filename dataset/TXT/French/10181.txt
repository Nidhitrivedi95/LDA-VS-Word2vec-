4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Perfect dinner spot in the heart of the Vegas Strip. My husband and I dined on the patio across from the Bellagio fountains. We just walked up to the hostess for a patio spot and only had to wait about 10 minutes to be seated. Our spot was perfect and allowed us to enjoy the Bellagio fountains and people watch. Hot, fresh baguette was complimentary. We split a Caesar salad and both had Filet Merlot that were cooked to perfection. We had a lovely dinner and will be back.
