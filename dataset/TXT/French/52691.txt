qauawyA4HmtCIvRG9gk-BA Ended up here for dinner because I was an idiot and didn't call for reservations early enough for Au Pied du Cochon and then decided to give this place a shot in place of it. What a great choice it turned out to be.

So I figured what the hell and went for the 7 course meal with wine pairings. It was beyond awesome although the sitting ended up taking almost 4 hours which had to be the longest dinner I've ever had.

The selections were all pretty good but my favorites were the duck foie gras, country bread and the beef. All the wine pairings were very good and the explanations from the waiter and sommelier were helpful and interesting.

So if your looking for a food orgy followed by a long food coma while amazingly not feeling stuffed go here. You will not be disappointed.
