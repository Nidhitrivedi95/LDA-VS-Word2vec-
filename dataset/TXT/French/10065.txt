Hubby and I had been pondering about a breakfast buffet in Vegas but opted out since we didn't want to spend $25-$35 at Paris buffet this time around. Well I got the sweet dish: fresh-made crispy waffles served with bacon in the mix with chocolate sauce on the side. Is your mouth watering yet? The waffle was satisfying but it wasn't the best waffle I've had. (Bouchon chicken and waffles are still my favorite.) The hubby opted for the savory dish which consisted of his favorite item: corned beef hash. Luckily for me, I taught my hubby to eat poached eggs and that was also included on top of the hash. Delicious...just add some hot sauce and your set.

Coffee is refillable and served unlimited. Service was great. Thanks Mon Ami Gabi for an overall great experience.
