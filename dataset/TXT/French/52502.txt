q0n4I-zqiI47xispOqc1lA Absolutely amazing . I had lunch at Caffe Mona and I had buffalo chicken crepe it was not on the menu before they changed the menu and everything and it became one of my favorites , it is something everybody should try . From preparation to presentation it was pleasing . The staff is great everything is fresh gotta love this place . I am also gonna attach a picture of a dessert they gave me as a treat . I will definetely be back . Thank you guys great business .
