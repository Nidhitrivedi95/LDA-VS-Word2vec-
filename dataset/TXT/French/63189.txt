SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA I gave up red meat for lent, but I need to come back here for their Cassoulet and Cod (supposedly his best dishes here!)

So, please don't look at just this rating. I will definitely need to come back to this restaurant again. The only reason I'm writing this review is maybe to recommend what dish may not be his best at this restaurant.

I've heard many great things about this restaurant and tons of friends have claimed for this to be his best yet restaurant. With that said, I didn't find my first time here to be as great as I expected.... however, I do believe i ordered the wrong dish.

Bouillabaisse for 2 (3.9): Since I got this for myself, I actually only for 'bouillabaisse for 1" so I didn't get to have lobster in my dish (boooooo...). Anyway, usually I love Zack's seafood dish. And don't get me wrong, this is better than most restaurants you'll ever go to, but not Zack's greatest. 

Pork Tenderloin - special of the day (3.5): Not Zack's best pork tenderloin. The meat was very tender and cooked well but the flavors were a bit on the bland side and the vegetables wasn't the best pairing for it. The white beans kind of overpowered the meat flavors. 

Zack, i'll be back! :D 

PS- the outdoor patio is awesome here!!!
