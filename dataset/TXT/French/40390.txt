KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA Love love love the ambiance.  The hostesses are less than friendly and they act like they are doing you a favor to seat you.  Even when you arrive with a reservation.  The food is always high quality and very good.  We went twice this week.  Once for Sunday Brunch and once for dinner with my family in town from Austria.  Both times we ordered the charcuterie plate which is incredible.  Great selection of meat and awesome cheese.  The dinner prices are a bit high but quality good tasting food.  Only major complaint is that they do not have a "house wine".  Be careful if you ask for it or ask for the to bring you something like a house wine.  Your gonna pay for it!!!  The restaurant sits on a man made lake.  We saw swans floating by both times.  There are small turtles that sit on the rocks right outside of where you sit.  I would like it if they could clean the spiderwebs that are all over the glass window enclosure.  We noticed it on both visits.  Oh, they have a mist system so when you sit outside on a warm Las Vegas evening it is quite comfortable.  Overall I would recommend this restaurant.
