7rjsddY6fB_SJXIVOLywTQ Could not be happier with the service and the food at Knox Taverne. The staff is super friendly! Ask them for a delicious cocktail and they will deliver! I have been there a couple of times and was never dissapointed. The Knox burger is a must try! Seriously heaven!! People need to skip  the usual Griffintown spots and walk over the bridge to give Knox Taverne a try! Go ahead! you won't regret it :)
