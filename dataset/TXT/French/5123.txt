37kk0IW6jL7ZlxZF6k2QBg Edulis continues to combine consistent quality of food and service with never ending variety of dishes changing daily according to the freshest and highest quality ingredients sourced locally as often as possible. The chicken is free range, the corn is specially sourced non genetically modified, the cheeses are from the Cheese Boutique, etc. The best available ingredients go into the meal. Michael and Tobey are always in the kitchen which explains the 'consistency' part of it. On the other side are the efficient waitstaff keeping the dishes coming in a relaxed, laid back style for a place with high food standards. Meticulous attention to detail from music selection to choice of dishes and cutlery help the small, intimate place feel cozy and relaxed, occasionally loud but in an animated way. The food is ...eclectic. Greens and herbs or fish which require a dictionary at times but it all tastes sooo good. Never the same so the surprise is on us. We are not young but we feel excited to go there. This review is the result of a few dozen visits by us two or parties of four with our various guests.
