ZdaZwXC0FByDY3EwNELphw Website needs an update. First, it suggests the restaurant is open for lunch 7-days a week. Clicking on the Menu link you see a Lunch and Dinner heading. Unfortunately, no Lunch menu under the Lunch heading. Yelp suggests the restaurant's hours do not include Tuesday but the site suggests its open for dinner.

No matter how good the food may be, visitors to the city don't like to visit an area and find conflicting information.
