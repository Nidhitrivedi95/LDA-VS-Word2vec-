This place, we were seated by the side of the restaurant with amazing views! The food, we ordered roasted bone marrow (comes with shredded pork), their special of the day: fried pork cutlet with eggs and something else...and the pork shank. 
First, the bone marrow comes with 1 bone only, expensive but it does come with shredded pork, so it's actually plentiful. The appetizers special of the day, well i know it's pork cutlet, it was amazing, quite a bug appetizer but a bit too salty...the pork shank is huge!! So if you're bringing only one other guest, this is a lot of food, we had leftover which was placed in a nice cosmo bag. The pork shank is tender, falls off the huge bone for the most part, they had a special cocktail for the day, included some bubbly inside, pretty good, forgot the name already. Our waitress was nice and quick, she knows her dishes and specials well, good recommendations by her, will visit again, yum yummm
