Amazing amazing amazing. 

Where do I start !! 
Ordered seafood tower. Everything was so fresh and tasty. 
Loved the lobster the oysters and the shrimp was probably the best shrimp I've had in my entire life 

Nicole. You're amazing. You were the best server I've had in vegas - to date. ! Literally been coming to Vegas for 10 years & this was amazing service. 

Fresh tasty food. She remembered everything I asked for and to the detail. I'm very impressed. 
She brought us a taste of sangria and we ordered the pitcher. This place was extremely on point. 
Very impressed. 

Oh and!! The bread was fresh & absolutely delicious. 

Nicole suggested bone in rib eye & merlot butter. 

My mouth is watering after writing this review. 

Sit outside if you can because the view of Bellagio fountains is amazing. 
Very impressed.
