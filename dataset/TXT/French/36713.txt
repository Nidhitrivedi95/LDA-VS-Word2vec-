IE-FSNn9Zx9YFx3nJV4C1A Excellent service and a great meal. We had reservations on a Tuesday night with a 2 and a half year old in tow and they couldn't have been more accommodating. My wife and I both ordered off the special menu and what a great deal with a soup/salad, entree and half a bottle of wine for 35 bucks. Both my beef carpaccio and my wife's canellonis were excellent. The wine was delicious as well as they selected a very nice Pinot to complement the meal. Best of all was the kids meal. My son has never eaten so well for less than 10 bucks. He received a half portion of the canellonis, a drink, and an excellent desert. They brought his meal out right away which was great because it provided a great distraction. Also compliments of the house were a delicious olive tapenade and a guacamole with fish. I would definitely come back and would love to give a big thank you to Michele and the rest of the staff for allowing us to have a nice meal in Montreal even with our son in tow.
