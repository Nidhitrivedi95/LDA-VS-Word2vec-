AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw Fanastic lunch deal - 3 courses for $19.  The dessert alone is $7 from their front counter.

We had a mushroom tart, sea bass in a chocolate soy sauce (couldn't discern the chocolate taste - but the sea bass was perfectly cooked) and of the desserts we sampled, the hazelnut was the best.  Like eating a better, creamier Ferrero Rocher.  Split between 2 girls, a perfect amount for a light lunch.
