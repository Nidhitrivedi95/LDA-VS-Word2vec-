4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw Mon Ami Gabi, you never cease to amaze me!

This is one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas. If you are not in mood for all you can eat buffets, I recommend coming here. Mon Ami Gabi has great selections of food to choose from. You in the mood for seafood? They have an amazing sea scallops dish that is caramelized. You in the mood for salad or a healthier option? They have a great grilled salmon and spinach salad sprinkled with walnuts and blueberries. It is delicious!  You in the mood for something heavier and with meat? Try their steak!!  I came with a big group of 12 people the first time and was seated right away with our reservation. I had a bite of some of my friends' dishes and I can confidently say that You will not be disappoint with your selection here. Everything is good here, which is rare to find in most restaurants. 

Service is also great here. I have been here twice during peak hours and my servers have been attentive and also personable. 

Reservation is recommended, but I actually came here with a friend recently on a Saturday afternoon around 11 a.m. I was worried that we were not going to get seated, but I got seated within 10-15 minutes in their outdoor area. I was also notified that there was no wait if I wanted to be seated inside. 

I would recommend sitting in their outdoor area because you get a good view of the strip.
