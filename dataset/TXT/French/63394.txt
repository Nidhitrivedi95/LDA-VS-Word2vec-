SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA The service is great, the statement about the water in other reviews, totally true and much appreciated!  The cheese tray is fun and a must try for anyone that is even a slight fan of cheese.  They fell a little short with the wine pairing as it was an afterthought and a very expensive glass of house wine.  All of the food was fairly heavy, I know it is a French restaurant but in retrospect I would have been happy with just the cheese tray (we did 5 split between 2 people, each cheese serving is approximately an ounce of cheese) and the French Onion Soup (it was extremely good and not your typical French Onion, it included large chunks of beef!) I ended up taking 3/4 of my dinner home as we were out celebrating my birthday and I was looking forward to Crème Brule.  I was a little disappointed when I learned they don't have serve typical Crème Brule but instead a Carmel Brule, I was however more than pleasantly surprised when they made an exception for my Birthday and brought me a true Crème Brule from their Carmel Brule, it was divine!  All in it was a great experience and I will definitely visit again.
