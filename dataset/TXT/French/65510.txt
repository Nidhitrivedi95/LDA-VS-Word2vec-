U1LB3sRMGTu_h7Sf9QdNoA Le Neuf is a cute authentic Parisian cafe/mini bistro located just a few minutes from King and Spadina on Clarence Square. When I speak to its authenticity, I'm not only referring to the decor and the type of food served; it is French-owned and even the waiters are straight from Paris-- oui oui. 

Note: I have been coming here for a long time and overall, it is clear that they need to do better when it comes to service and at times, being short staffed; sometimes the wait is too long and the service feels like you're truly in France.

With that said, the patio is packed during the summer and especially at lunch time. I would recommend the croissants, especially the chocolate croissant which is my favorite; the buckwheat galettes are a perfect lunch option, along with their several salads and traditional quiches and crepes. The dinner menu serves up classic french fare like french onion soup, escargots, steak frites and steak tartare.
