Holders was lovely, warm and inviting. Staff was as well. Friend and I stopped for lunch, and were lucky to get there just before the lunch rush. Service was prompt, courteous and efficient without being overbearing. Menu was interesting and very varied. 

My friend had the Braised beef cheek, which he liked very much, and I had the seafood soup and the warm octopus and new potato salad. Octopus is a favorite of mine, but you take your chances, as it can be very rubbery if cooked poorly. Luckily, the chef at Holders knew EXACTLY how to cook it, and it was wonderful. The contrast of the octopus and the potatoes, highlighted by the sauce was delectable. 

Will definitely go again when in Montreal.
