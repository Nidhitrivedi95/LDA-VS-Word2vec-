Cheers: Any of the macarons, especially the raspberry and lemon. The TKO - super yum! Almond brioche. Cheese danish. Croissant. Fruit tart, on that crust.

Jeers: The cupcakes were astoundingly boring. Chocolate was good, but I've had better. The red velvet was dry and dull. The carrot cake, I had hopes for you, but they were quickly dashed when it tasted dayold.

I thought it was pretty pricey for average tasting baked goods, especially for all the raves. Maybe I caught the baked goods on an off day? Will try again next time in Vegas.

BTW, damn good coffee.
