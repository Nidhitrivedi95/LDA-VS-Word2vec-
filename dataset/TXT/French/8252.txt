The day we came in the patio was open but it was a little windy, so we opted to sit in the atrium area and it was a great choice, you can still see outside for people watching. The interior of the restaurant was a little dark, but would be nice and romantic for dinner time.

I enjoyed the cinnamon skinny pancake, the flavors were like heaven in your mouth. My honey had the oyster Benedict and said it was fantastic. With reasonable prices and great food its a no brainer, you should definitely check it out.
