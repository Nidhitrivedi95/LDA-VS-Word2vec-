4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I wanted to love Mon Ami Gabi but alas, it was not meant to be. The steak was only average, the herb butter and the pomme puree were both so salty they rendered the rest of the dish inedible. The french green beans were delicious and the fresh bread was among the best I've ever had. 
Our server was great, very sweet and attentive, but the food was so mediocre that our awesome waitress just couldn't quite save the meal.
