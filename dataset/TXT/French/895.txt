_cjPEH9wXhKS-HQe_U3M4Q I'm not a huge fan of French food in general. I can't exactly pinpoint what it is, but I just never get excited about it. With that in mind, I was actually pleasantly surprised with my meal at Le Select Bistro.

Staff: Staff was friendly and accommodating. It was a large party and some were arriving later than others. They were pretty attentive throughout the night keeping our glasses full and ensuring we had everything we wanted. The food came at a fairly reasonable rate. It was a birthday so we had brought a cake. There was a plating fee which was unfortunate but no unheard of but they did add fruit to the plates so it wasn't just a fee for slicing a cake.

Ambience: Very comfortable for parties of all sizes. Great seating and tall ceilings. We made it pretty loud since we were such a large party. The soft light made it very intimate but it wasn't too dark which was great. I did find that our table was a little cramped but they cleared the table away pretty often so it wasn't too bad.

Food: I ordered Assiette de Charcuterie which was their assorted meats to start. It was alright and nothing unique about it. For my main I ordered the Poulet Grillé Bio which was their chicken on top of grilled vegetables. The chicken was a little overcooked but the zucchini and tomatoes was nice.

I think at the end of the day, the ambience and service made this a very nice experience. However, the food was good but nothing really wowed me.
