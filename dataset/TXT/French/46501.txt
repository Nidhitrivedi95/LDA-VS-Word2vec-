nKeGPmH5dYNVL5AyAItuKg I am a sucker for hipster restaurants with innovative food, and Restaurant Chantecler more than met my expectation. It is a small place with a simple food menu, but everything I tried was delicious. The bartender was so friendly, eager to share, and knowledgeable. I enjoyed a couple of bourbon cocktails that he recommended, and two of the most popular dishes. I hate to admit this, but i had the fried calamari and the popcorn shrimp (fatty!). The calamari was tasty, but I think I would choose other options next time. It reminded me somewhat of orange chicken at a Chinese restaurant. But the popcorn shrimp - omg. Innovative, fun, delicious -- all words that describe this dish. I have no idea how they get popcorn to stick to the shrimp, but it's so good. I love the spice on top of the shrimp as well. 

As a visitor to town, this was the perfect friendly, intimate bar experience for me, and I would love to return to sample more of the menu.
