4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I think I am the exception to the rule here. I do not see the hype. Service was painfully slow which is understandable given how busy they are but to wait 25 mins to order WITHOUT bread is not cool! 

Make sure to look at your bill if you have a large party!! They charged me service charge, gratuity, and event charge!! Omg 3 extra charges just because I had a large group?

The French onion soup is pretty good and the bread is fresh and hot but the steak was not that good and the fries were so hard they should call them chips!
