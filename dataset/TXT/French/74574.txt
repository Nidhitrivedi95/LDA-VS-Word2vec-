xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g Yesterday, my wife and I went there to celebrate one year anniversary. I made reservation and requested  table by the window with the view on Bellagio's fountain. I also asked if they can put roses on the table. When we arrived, everything was organized and roses were there. Joshua was our waiter. I have never seen anyone provide such high level of service. In Seattle, we ate at Canlis, Rover's, and some other expensive restaurants, but we have never seen anyone come close to Joshua's level of service. This guy was amazing. We took his advice and recommendation and ended up being extremely happy at the end of the night. Food was amazing. Wine was great. Their dessert is so good you may experience orgasm. This restaurant will not disappoint you. It is expensive, but it is worth every single penny. Right there and then, we decided to make it our annual tradition to come to the Eiffel Tower every year on March 8. Thank you Joshua, thank you Eiffel Tower!
