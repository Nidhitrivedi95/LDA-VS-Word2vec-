rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw Holy butter!  French comfort food is the perfect description for this upscale French bistro from Michael Mina. Be prepared because the food is rich. 
So many delicious items on the menu, I couldn't decide what to order... guess I'll have to come back to try the things I missed!

So we ended up with-
Apps-
Seared Foie Lyonnais - rich beyond belief... foie was perfectly seared... the balance of the dish was perfectly complementary to the foie. 
King Crab Crepe- so good... buerre blanc and sunny side egg combined with the crab was a flavor explosion.  
Entrees-
Lamb Rack Frites- perfectly cooked, well seasoned... the chickpea frites were interesting in a good way.
Sole Meunière- nice and delicate... decent, but the weakest dish of the night.
Dessert-
Baba au rhum- holy crap this was good... literally a mouthful of butter, cream and rum soaked up by a spongy cake. 

Service and setting were spot on.  Food is delicious and decadent. Thumbs up.
