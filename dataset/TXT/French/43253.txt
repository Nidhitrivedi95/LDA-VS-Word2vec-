lsfPvV4iZop_rA3PUZeZJA Great location......great service......nice restaurant........maybe brunch isn't their thing. This is an area with some of the best brunch places in the city, Sparrow, Lawrence, Larry's, etc. all within a few short blocks of each other on St-Laurent. If you're going to open for brunch you need to step up your game and make it amazing. There were only 2 other diners in the restaurant with us but all the other places were packed with people standing in line. The food here was very average, that being said I've heard very good things about their dinners. I had the 'Caribou Breakfast', which looked incredible when it got to the table and had several different items on the plate, but each item was mediocre at best and nothing really stood out for the $19 price tag. The mini sugar-cinnamon donuts with chocolate dipping sauce were good. Overall, I'd like to go back there and try dinner but brunch has too many other great places across the city.
