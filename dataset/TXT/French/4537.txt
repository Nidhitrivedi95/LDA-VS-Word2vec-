We shared the bone marrow between the four of us, and it was delicious. Perfect example of melt-in-your-mouth goodness. They also give you a giant jar of cornichons to snack on, which is nice.

For my entree, I had the quail with dirty rice. It was served with romaine lettuce, so you could make a scoop out of it. The rice was great, but the quail... the quail was was amazing. Five pieces of perfectly cooked poultry.

I also tried my buddy's steak frites, which were also really good. A bit heavy though, but that's to be expected.

This was our last meal in Montreal before heading to the airport, so we moved to the bar to have some coffee before we left. The host (or manager? or owner?) came by and offered us shots of this coffee liqueur in celebration. She did one with us as well. When we asked how much we owed her for the espresso, she told us to just get out of there. Lovely lady.

In terms of going away meals, you'd be hard pressed to find a better option than L'Express.
