6fPQJq4f_yiq1NHn0fd11Q I ate here a few Monday's ago for breakfast with my girlfriend.  I had looked at the menu the night before and knew that I had to decide between a savory ham & cheese crepe and a more sweet blueberry lemon crepe.  That morning I was feeling savory and so I went over to find a seat in the seating area while my girlfriend did the ordering.  Due to that I don't really have much to say about the place itself since I did not see much of it.  My ham and cheese crepe came out to me looking nice and covered in a béchamel sauce which I mistook as cheese.  The crepe was pretty tasty as ham was good and salty which paired nicely with the Gruyere and it quickly disappeared from my plate.  Whenever my girlfriend had also finished her crepe we started talking about ordering a sweeter crepe for a dessert of sorts.  My girlfriend decided to spoil me and let me have both of the crepes that I had thought looked good the night before by deciding to split the blueberry lemon crepe with me.  She once again went over and ordered and came back with an amazing looking plate.  The crepe was in the center covered in a berry sauce, blueberries and powdered sugar with a Chantilly cream on the side.  In the middle of the crepe was some lemon curd which gave the dish some sourness that worked really well with everything else that was sweet on the plate to keep it from being too sweet.  In the end there was nothing left as we both had enjoyed our meal.

The bottom line for me is that I would stop by here again in the future.  While I believe that it is a bit overpriced to enjoy on a regular basis, the food is great and it could easily be a nice little treat every now and again.
