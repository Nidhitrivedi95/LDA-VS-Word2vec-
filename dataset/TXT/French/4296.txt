Indeed, it felt like an intimate but bustling French bistro off of a central street, and the food was good - loved the bone marrow and especially the shrimp risotto! However, I was a little surprised by the service. It felt slow and inattentive and it wasn't until I mentioned that my sister was running the marathon the next day that we got constant refills of water. We're Americans, so perhaps we have different expectations of speed of service, I will give the restaurant that. Despite the service though, I thought the place was good, and almost great. Definitely worth a stop if you're looking for French food that is simple and traditional.
