rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A After almost an hour wait to get seated, we waited another half for our food. While the place gives off a nice ambiance, the wait was not really worth it for the food. To top it off, the water glasses were dirty and our waiter was not that attentive... They forgot our meal coffee and juice until I reminded them. Save yourself some time and spend your $30 a plate somewhere in the forums.
