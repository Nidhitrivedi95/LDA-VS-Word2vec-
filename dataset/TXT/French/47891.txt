O3OH5IEFMPtz7mPKakPZ3Q OMG this place is amazing!!! I went last night to try the tobanyaki shrimp, salmon tacos, tuna lotus chip, and the yellow tail sashimi!! The manager I believe was soooooo nice! They told us about their amazing happy hour times and to be sure to look at their chalkboard for specials. Everything here was delicious, reasonably priced for quality fish and beef, and the service was amazing!!! I will definitely be coming here at least once a week.
