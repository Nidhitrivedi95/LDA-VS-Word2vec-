tCSlpwJQ4CZsUEMZeH2SFg I love breakfast.  I especially love eggs, with warm, runny yolks, oozing over some variety of carbohydrate ... mm mm.

Eggs.

Ok, I digress.  Do you know what else I like? I like Cafe Monte.  Why? Because they fed me some excellent eggs.  We had been wanting to try Cafe Monte for quite a while, and once we discovered that they were in our Citipass (the best $25 you can spend, btw), we decided to give them a go for a late Saturday morning breakfast.

The restaurant's space itself is beautiful.  It has a turn-of-the-century Paris vibe that really sets the mood for the food.  Our waiter was helpful and polite in an unobtrusive way that seemed peculiarly French.  Mind you, I've never been to France, so that's a statement of instinct.

Let me not forget the food, for it was delicious.  I ordered the Benedict Monte, with two beautifully poached, wispy eggs, ham, tomato, asparagus, potatoes, and Hollandaise sauce, served with a croissant.  It was fabulous.  

Though our Citipass voucher is now spent, we will return to Cafe Monte at full price with no hesitation at all.
