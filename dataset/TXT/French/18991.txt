An_U8woQkFVsMqVblkImZQ The food here is okay but not worth it. Most of it is fairly bland, and considering that it's over-priced. The deserts are 7.5$/8$ each and should be more like 3-4$. The baked goods at Loblaws are a significant step up. My main cost about $18 and was mediocre at best.  The seats here are also very uncomfortable.  It's a cute restaurant, and the staff were pretty good, but if you're going to spend 44$ on a meal you should go somewhere else.
