A0X1baHPgw9IiBRivu0G9g I came to Patisserie Manon for dessert since I am a huge dessert fan. Since this place received some good reviews I wanted to try it out myself and see how good this place is. I ordered every flavor of French Macarons. Their French Macarons looked deformed but they were okay not bad for the price of $1.10. I wasn't a big fan of the ginger and peanut butter. I also ended up ordering the coffee eclair and the mimosa cake. The coffee eclair was really good, never tasted an eclair like that before. The mimosa cake was good, it was moist and not dry like some other cakes.
