htQgj-ANQpZGpIpkkrEmyQ Yum! I was pleasantly surprised! The service was great here!! Make sure you make a reservation first, especially for the weekends, because I was turned down on a Friday night since they were fully booked until 9pm. Their menu is pretty good. I ended up getting the INSP burger that had pork belly, a beef burger and fried egg. It was really good! There was deep fried onion slices (they were very thinly sliced) inside that added a very nice crunch to the burger. I also opted for the more expensive duck confit fries for an extra $4. The spicy mayo sauce on the fries was good, but the duck was a bit too salty for me. The portion was really big, so whatever food you have left they allow you to take it back home. I was too full for dessert, so I'm probably going  to come back for their dessert! Overall there is a nice presentation of the food and I love their cucumber and carrot infused water! It was decently priced, the bill came up to $26 including a 15% tip.
