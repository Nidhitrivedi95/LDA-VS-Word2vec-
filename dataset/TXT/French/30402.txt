FUX9h1a37GJn9ge1baiNuw One thing that really is not excusable in my book is when food is served to you partially warm.  I understand that the food has been sitting in the deli cooler, but deng. Take that extra minute and heat my food up correctly.

I ate a ham and swiss quiche.  It wasn't warm.  It  did taste good, though I've had much better in France.

I tasted a friend's ham sandwich and the bread's denser than I would like.  He enjoyed it though.
