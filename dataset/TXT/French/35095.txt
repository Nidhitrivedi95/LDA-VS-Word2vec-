HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw I like the food here but the manager/sommelier or whatever he was needs to buy a personality. 
I can only conclude that the manager / sommelier has no sense of humour - he had a French accent and I got excited and asked if he was French Canadian from Quebec. When he looked aghast at me I corrected myself and said Paris? I never did get an answer from him and he left leaving me feeling awkward. It ruined the whole experience for me. A very bad vibe. 
As a customer I expect to be treated with more grace by a professional in the hospitality industry. 
Overall I felt uncomfortable....

A restaurant is more than its food!
