After a long queue to get in the restaurant I was offered the last plate of pork belly which I couldn't refuse. The fattiness of the tender pork blended perfectly with the sweet smokiness of the maple syrup which caught me by surprise. I didn't expect the Canadian nectar of life to be in this dish - a pleasant surprise. The infamous mac and cheese also had maple syrup which works perfectly with the truffle oil. The food was fantastic.

As a Canadian, I'm proud of this restaurant showcasing the iconic maple syrup in many of the dishes. Good job Robin Square. If you happen to be nearby the Old Port then I'd recommend looking for a restaurant with a huge team Rocket 'R' stamped on the window. It'll blast you off at the speed of light.
