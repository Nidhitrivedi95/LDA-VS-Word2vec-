We then split a Roquefort salad. Quite tasty. We split two entrees - filet mignon and lamb shank. Filet was cooked well and sides were very good. Lamb shank was cooked well, but the sauce sucked. Dessert consisted of two tarts - Samoa and Four Berry. Four Berry was really good. Samoa was okay, but not great.

All in all the bill was close to $150 without a drop of liquor.   For that kind of money we/you could have two meals elsewhere.
