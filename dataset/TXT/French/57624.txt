rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Went to vegas a few weeks ago and had the opportunity to go to Bouchon for dinner. We were staying in the hotel but also wanted a classic and tasty menu. Their bread was amazing. I am still dreaming about it. Some at our table got salads to start and they all looked amazing. We opted for dessert instead of starters. My boyfriend got the salmon special of the night and was very pleased. Our friend got the scallops special and was raving about it. He said they were the best scallops he ever had. A few of our friends also ordered steak and were very happy with it. They all came with a lot of fries so there was enough to go around a table of 7. I had the white fish special and my friend got the mussels with fries. Everyone opted for dessert seeing how good dinner was. We ordered the creme brulee and profiteroles around the table. The creme brulee was amazing but I didn't try the profiteroles. They disappeared though, I so assume they were good. For a table of 7 our bill was less than $800 which was surprising because we started with drinks, ordered a bottle of wine, starters, mains and desserts. If you are in vegas and get the chance to try this place, I highly recommend.
