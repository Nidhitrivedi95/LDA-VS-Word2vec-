9iy6scMRbs5ue41XRLGEkw After being called "Girls" at every single encounter with the waiter at lunch today, and forgiving it every single time, as we were leaving, and again told "Goodbye Girls" I said, do me a favor. I'm not a girl. The waiter said he was trying to be nice, make me seem younger. (Whoa, doggie!) I said he wouldn't like being called "Boy" and he said it was different. I said he was right, because society didn't discriminate against men. Then he called me sensitive. DAMN STRAIGHT!  I'm sensitive to discrimination. 
The food was great. Boy waiter was very slow. I loved that the owner came out and welcomed us.
