Moga Crepes offers fresh fair with a healthy alternative. You can choose from crepes, rice bowls or garden bowls.  From there, you pick your protein, add some fresh cut vegetable choices, sauce and boom: excellent fresh fair at a value price. Options include spinach, spring greens, peppers, etc. amongst many others. I had a garden bowl with chicken, quinoa, spinach, red and banana peppers and mushrooms sauteed in pesto sauce served on a bed of greens and topped with feta cheese. AMAZINGLY delicious. I predict this establishment is going to go far and will soon be in many more locations. The dessert crepes look great too.
