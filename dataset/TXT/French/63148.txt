SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA Although my Choucroute Garnie was very salty (the sauce), I still give L'Albatros 4 stars.  There were certain elements of the dish that saved the day.  The Pork Belly in the Choucroute was so tender it was like butter and the sausages-which were probably made in house no doubt was my favorite part of the dish.  The Terrine du Chef was the best part of the meal- Not only was it beautiful to look at, but it was beautiful in flavor as well.  I was really pleased to see that they had Vouvray on their Wines by the Glass list-it's my favorite white wine and a lot of restaurants don't offer it. I really like the ambience in L'Albatros and I always feel special when I go there, whether it's for a girl's night, happy hour or a romantic date. The service is impeccable and it really adds to the experience.
