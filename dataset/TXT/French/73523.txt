xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g It's no secret that this place is good. I wouldn't expect anything less. 

From the moment your brought up in the elevator to the moment you head back to the hustle and bustle of the casino, you definitely are living an experience. 

Low lighting and a view that can't be beat, fine linens, and wait staff who attend to your every need, the Eiffel Tower is first class all the way. 

I selected their smoked salmon to start and I have never had a better piece of fish. Smooth, thinly sliced, and melt in your mouth buttery taste accompanied the onion, capers, and creme fraiche (not sure of my French spelling here) with several slices of perfectly toasted bread. I could have eaten a second plate and called it a meal. The capers were surprisingly delicious - not the over salted from a jar variety. 

Most of us selected their filet mignon, with several different toppings to choose from. I couldn't resist and chose the decadent Bernaise sauce. The steak itself was cooked to perfection and the interior was almost as buttery smooth as the sauce itself. There were a ton of sides passed around our table, but the winners were the potatoes gratin (perfect in their simplicity) and the mushroom spätzle (yes they eat German food in parts of France). 

Desserts probably deserve their own review, but to put it simply; save room and order a bunch to taste and share. The chocolate plate will leave any chocoholic in heaven. 

Pricey, but worth every penny.
