4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw The Top 3 Vegas French restaurants on my list are: Alize, Fleur de Lys and Mon Ami Gabi.

I go to Mon Ami Gabi at Paris for dinner just as much as I go to Taqueria Canonita at Venetian for lunch. Alize and Fleur de Lys I've only been to once, because they're more of a very special occasion type establishment (i.e. Valentine's Day dinner/wedding rehearsal dinner)

Here's what we always order:
Appetizers: Country Style Pt, Escargots de Bourgogne & Crab Cake
Salads: Double Duck Leg Confit Salad &/ Steak Salad Maison
Soup: Onion Soup Au Gratin
Entrees: Filet Mignon Au Poivre, Seared Sea Scallops &/ Skate
Dessert: can't go wrong, just order what you feel like

And if the weather permits, ask for the outdoor seating in front of the Bellagio dancing water fountain. I also suggest asking the waiter to make suggestions for the right wine to go with your meal.
