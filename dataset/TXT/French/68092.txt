vg55SAkrEmuHpWfIMtJjBQ Went to Legume with a group of friends for the holidays. The food was excellent, and the menu offers a variety of dishes that are unique and delicious!  We sampled multiple "starters", and everything was really good- I recommend the fried pickles!  The same kitchen services the attached bar, and although we only had drinks there, the burgers looked awesome!  We all had excellent meals and were satisfied with the portion sizes for the price!  This is a great place to go and we'll definitely be back!  Our compliments to the chef!
