sARavfidmIS878q5BtlyVQ Amazing, personal, enjoyable experience. Price for my wife and I was $1250 out the door. One of us did the lowest tier wine pairing and one did the highest tier wine pairing. We both did the truffle supplement. I would forgo the wine pairings in the future as half of the wines are fortified and was not really our thing. Would have enjoyed some more spanish reds. Skipping these would have saved us $500. 

We went to Joel Robuchon the next night and the service and quality of food put out by E was in our opinion, much better than what Robuchon put down for us AND Robuchon was much more expensive. 

This place is a must for any foodie.

One thing that could be improved on is the greeting when you arrive. You are placed at a table in the regular restaurant with the other guests that you will be dining with. It would be nice if they immediately offered your a cocktail or glass of wine (even better if it was complimentary). It was awkward asking for a menu then trying to order something to drink while we sat there.
