rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A This restaurant was pretty good but I have definitely had better in Vegas. I guess i had really high expectations given the reviews and the fact that this is a Keller restaurant. What we ordered: Beef Bourguignon, New York Steak Frites, Onion Soup, Mussels, and Fries. The soup is delicious! You must try the soup if you come here. Everything else was A-ok. My steak was overcooked and my husband can make a better beef bourguignon at home. Again, it is a good restaurant but given the price, the crowded dining area (tables are very close to one another so its not very intimate), and the quality of the food, I would never consider this to be a 5 star restaurant. Im glad i tried this restaurant but I do not think I will be returning.
