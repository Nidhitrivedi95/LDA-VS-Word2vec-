kcF-en40P3J9L8nLy5lKqQ We visited on a busy Friday evening.  The place was packed and had great energy.  There was a wait which really didn't matter since we like to sit at the bar so when two seats quickly opened and we sat immediately.  The ambiance is worth five stars alone.  The decor, the open windows and the amazing wine room make this place inviting and attractive.  After ordering the wine and an appetizer (Wood Grilled Artichoke) we waited...and waited...and waited some more.  The bartender noticed how long we waited several times and kept checking with the kitchen.  After about 35 minuets and an apology from the bartender the artichokes we delivered by someone...perhaps a manager with another very forced and dry apology.  The chokes were OK, but not fully cooked but the ailoi was delicious.  As expected  two minutes after the app was dropped our entrees arrived...annoying.  The Grilled Vegetable dish was served with a goat cheese spread and overall was good but not something I'd order again (my fault for ordering).  My husband had the Steak Frites and enjoy it.  

As soon as the check was dropped the service dropped.  Not once did the bartender ask if we wanted another glass of wine when our glasses sat empty for nearly 30 min nor was there any further contact from any employee.  The best part of the whole experience was when the bartender who wad been serving us that night grabs her purse, clocks out and then sits next to the guy sitting next to us and starts having a conversation.  I guess she didn't care that we hadn't paid yet...she must not be hurting for tips?  I understand food timing issues and that kitchens get backed up sometimes but I don't understand poor service and the lack of recovery from staff and especially the managers.  If something is wrong at a table or the bar, it is the managers responsibility to take action and not ignore it.
