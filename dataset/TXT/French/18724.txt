AHosGBveeXx9YjsQvdJgeg Great spot for a special occasion. We've been here twice now and enjoyed an excellent dining experience both times. This past visit was for NYE dinner and we chose our meals from a set menu, which we were unaware of when we sat down, but our palates weren't disappointed. 

Appetizers: crab cake (really tasty, though nothing out of the norm for this dish), and the Oysters Benedict (AMAZING!) 

Dinner: my husband and I both had the filet mignon, and were quite satisfied. Unfortunately the air vent was blasting right above our table and my meal cooled down significantly at a significant pace. Why the restaurant was blowing cool air on December 31 is beyond me. 

Dessert: bananas foster and chocolate cake (pictured). I'm not usually a fan of banana in my desserts, but that was definitely the better choice. 

Overall, great experience -- will be back again for another special occasion.
