rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A Brunched on 9/29, not my first time. Showed up around 10:30, had a 15 minute wait.  Our group of four were seated outside near the pool (per our request) rather quickly. Drinks, bread, coffee came quick.  After some small talk and what seemed like an eternity (but was really 10 minutes of excited anticipation) my plate of chicken and waffles arrived. 

The chicken is prepared perfectly, the gravy is savory and thick, the waffles lovingly accept the entire boat of syrup without letting any spill into your plate. (Don't forget to slather on Vanilla Beam Butter first!) Simply put, this is the very best breakfast that Vegas has to offer.
