oZHbPhIj01_31jqD053a_Q Europea was excellent from start to finish. The wait staff is attentive and knowledgeable. The food is absolutely delicious. Every course you could not ask for anything more delectable. My husband and I went here for a small trip to Montreal celebrating our wedding anniversary. This was literally one of the top three things about our entire trip. We were not expecting to have one of the best meals of our lives in Canada but we sure did at Europea.  It's also not just the five star food it's the entire dining experience. The wine list was also very very extensive and I appreciate that they had a wine connoisseur available to suggest what wines we should try. If you are in Montreal you're missing out if you do not go !
