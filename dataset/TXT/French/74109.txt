xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g granted the prices are expensive, but what on the strip isn't. a three course meal with a bottle of wine for two will run you $250 - $300. advice: make reservations, come early, and tip the host for the corner table.  if you'd like the souffle for dessert, order it the minute you sit down, the chocolate or grand m. are the best.
