QeFsIMcIFIJcOrpthYL8jg The music really makes this spot! The food is definitely just middle of the road. The vegetarian option didn't have really much flavor but the chicken wasn't bad. It is definitely busy so the servers have lots of tables to tend to. Go here for the atmosphere and you won't be disappointed.
