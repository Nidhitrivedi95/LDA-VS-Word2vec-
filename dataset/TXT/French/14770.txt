5fquJHY2hMX9tPRD5s0t5g After many dinners/drinks here over the years I guess this is the last. The menu is so vague and full of itself, that the waiter had to give a monologue on what everything meant and what was missing/hard to understand. This was BEFORE we where asked about what drinks we wanted. Is this a tapas? Is this an entree w/ sides? What's the portion again - 1oz on this and 2oz on that? We were as confused about the menu as we were listening to the server give the 5 minute rundown on the what was really on the menu. The menu only has the name of the dish. No description of how prepared or anything. Our table was left shrugging shoulders and just hoped for the best. My past favorite, the Short Rib, was far different, and inferior, than it was a dozen visits before. :(  Lastly, they need to up their cocktail list for those who like to try new concoctions. What happened to your delicious Basil Cocktail? (brought over from Good Food).
