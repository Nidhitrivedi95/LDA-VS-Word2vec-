lQ9VmIWvM6v-rONPkYX8aQ Alex is an amazing dining experience!  We had a large group and were seated in the private dining room, which was nice considering the restaurant is not that large. The service was exceptional and the staff was very knowledgeable.  They were able to accommodate everyone's special needs, which was surprising since we had  a vegetarian, a pescatarian and someone with a shellfish food allergy.  I was impressed.  Each course was beautifully presented and each bite was perfection.  The seared foie gras was seriously the best thing I've ever tasted!!! The flavor and the way it melted in my mouth has me salivating now.  Other highlights included: the diver scallops, wagyu beef tartar, and the beef tenderloin.  I tried my friends chicken and it was super moist and very flavorful.  The beignets and ice cream had me wanting more and were the perfect way to end a great meal.  Good friends, great service and excellent food, I couldn't have had a better dining experience.
