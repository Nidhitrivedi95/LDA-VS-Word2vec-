4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw I always walk by here and eating on the outside patio seemed so perfect.  The weather was perfect and sunny.  Anyway, the wait was a bit long and we decided to sit inside.  

I was expecting good food, like really good food and probably small portions.  Anyway we ordered the French onion soup and the beef hash with poached eggs.

The soup was too salty, we received 2 pieces of potatoes with the eggs, and the eggs were a little overcooked.  The hash was decent.  

Honestly, the bread they gave us to go with the meal was the best-nutty soft with butter and fresh jam.

I don't' really see what the hype was, but I still enjoyed my time here.
