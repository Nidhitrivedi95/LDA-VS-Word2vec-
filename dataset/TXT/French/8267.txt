4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw awesome location. great service. great food. 
went for brunch, my wife had the blueberry french toast which she says was melt in your mouth good (didn't try..allergies, like living..) I had the corned beef hash... not saying it's the best ever, but it's the best i've ever had - hands down - and the capuccino 'bowl' gives you a much needed boost to go lose all your money and not think twice about it... go, you'll thank me later.. oh the hot bread... how can i forget the baguette... mmmm bread and butter - just go, hopefully you get a nice seat on the deck
