Ht-_i0UAq7YDBaqJwcQMdQ Overrated place with sub par cooking techniques (all dishes very greasy) and even ingredients. The Kobe beef from the signature dish ($59) surf and turf is just so so and bit too salty and also not best cut. Raviolis in the dish tastes like medicine- when you think it's very hard to go wrong with Raviolis. Expected mine blowing quality food with the 4 star rating but got disappointed. The parfait dessert tastes nothing different than a Haagen das ice cream. Lacking sophistication in overall food quality- dispite the seemingly interesting and innovative presentation. Ambience is trendy and classic though in a basement in prime district.
