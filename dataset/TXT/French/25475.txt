Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA Loved it. The room is beautiful, the view was great. The hostess (young, long hair) was helpful and very nice. We asked for a table with a view and she was accommodating. She sent us to the bar and fetched us after a short wait. The mojitos at the bar were awesome. The bartenders were friendly and went to to the trouble of going to the kitchen to search for mint. Bread basket was okay, the peanut butter spread was interesting but not fabulous. Our party of three had the spicy crab salad, filet mignon and farmers market vegetable cookpot. All were delicious. They were accommodating with the request to make the mac and cheese without ham. Our waiter was attentive and service was excellent. He brought us profiteroles warm from the pan with chocolate, on the house. Can't wait to go back.
