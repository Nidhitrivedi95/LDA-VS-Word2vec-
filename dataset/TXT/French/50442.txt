ovtlrcsVRlgZZQUlHs_ovw Went tonight (Saturday) and it was great. Made a reservation about 2 hrs before going and was seated right when we walked in. I of course read all of the bad reviews first. I didn't notice a hint of any of those problems. Server gives some background on the chef if you are a first timer. Not cheap... but you get what you pay for.  burger=outstanding and onion soup is just as good as they say.  I plan to go back to try lunch soon. we left the kids home but they did have mac and cheese for $5 if you bring them with. 2 burgers, sweet fries, onion soup, one drink each, plus tip is about $60. worth every penny
