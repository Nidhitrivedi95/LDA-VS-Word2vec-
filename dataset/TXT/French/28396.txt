EEIz44ewHhOKmfTloAK13g What a treat to dine at Alo!  I didn't know what to expect!  The space is a really cool upstairs and it was intimate.  The service was impeccable.  I don't think I've ever had service like that in Toronto.  The prix fixe was reasonable for what we got in terms of quality and type of food.  Most memorable was the crab grits, the bread (!!), lobster and the rib eye.  Then 3 dessert rounds came out.  Portions are small but we were STUFFED.  Returning in a few months for my husband's birthday!
