n_bJq-tCY0TZVhNJBuLHMg If only I can give this place negative stars. Beautiful place, horrendous food. I went during summer for brunch and the whole menu was one false representation after another. They advertised kumquats yet they gave me chunks of orange. They said Nutella on the French toast which was probably 6 months old yet the drizzled it with nesquik. I won't go on and on cause they're not worth any other effort.  Disaster. Offensive.  What a waste.
