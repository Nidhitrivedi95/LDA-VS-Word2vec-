el-3IdlW3bTCSnquLvH-3w Very unhappy.  Restaurant week guest and the food was mediocre at best.  $33 per person with food quality at about a $10 level.  I've had better Marsala from the freezer section at the grocery.  People were all very nice but the food was not up to par and the portions were small.  My date and I left hungry.  Tip to owners: If you want repeat guests from restaurant week, step it up a notch and wow your patrons.   We really wanted this place to be good.  Sad.
