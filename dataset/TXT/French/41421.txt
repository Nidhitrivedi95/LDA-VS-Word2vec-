kGOr_D-LNpgZ2M9N8TT4QQ This is a beautiful restaurant but the service doesn't quite match what you'd expect. 

Presentation wise, it's good. I guess the quality of the food is good too, but the service is poor compared to the rest. 
I have been there about 5 times and the entire experience did not exactly justify the bill I had to pay in the end. 
I have had different servers every time, and only one of them gave me good service. Once I had to wait 25 minutes for the waiter to get my bill (I actually counted the minutes). Another time I had a waitress that behaved like she did not want to be there. Last time I was there I had 2 waiters and both forgot about my table; a table of 5 people!

It's a shame because the space is so wonderful, large and elegant. Not worth it.
