BSmqxPbQglQwP2R56OqOag Solid restaurant.  Lots of interesting things on the menu.  Been here about three times and hadn't really had a bad dish or drink  . . . until this last time.

They have a great cocktail menu and there are a lot of good food options (the burrata and pork tenderloin standout).  Last time I went they were out of the baby back ribs so I went with the steak au poivre.  This is going to sound nuts, but the steak was way too, uh, au poivre.  Way too much pepper action.

That being said, it's a great dinner option in the area (where you don't have to break the bank).  Also, every time I've been there I haven't seen an empty table.  Be sure to make a rezzie.
