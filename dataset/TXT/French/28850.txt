el-3IdlW3bTCSnquLvH-3w This place is totally French and very good in many ways. First, the crepes were perfect. They were light and melt in your mouth. Mine was smoked salmon,  cream cheese, capers, lemon and onion. Absolutely delicious. We also ordered an omelette which was perfect.  We ordered croissants on the side, and they were light and buttery without being greasy or heavy.  Service was excellent.  Coffee was very good. Staff was very friendly.  Excellent value!  You will spend more than at a IHop or Denny's,  but so much better than those places. So worth it!
